Wonderous. I've lost hours spinning in circles exploring the far reaches of the world and beyond. I can't think of a better way to spend $100 on a product.\n\nSamsung's Gear VR was developed in a collaboration with the company that re-launched virtual reality as a thing that actually works and is worth doing: Oculus. While the production version of the Oculus Rift ships this summer, the Gear VR is available now for only $100.\n\nUnderstandably, it's not nearly as elaborate or as powerful as the Rift. However, it gives you an incredible taste of what the Oculus can do, for a fraction of the price. Well... a fraction of the price if you already own a specific Samsung phones (Galaxy S7, S7 edge, S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+, and Note5). These phones lock into the front of the Gear VR and act as the screen and the brains. What your $100 buys you is the device to hold it on your head, the lenses to let you see the screen up close, and access to the Gear VR ecosystem of games, videos, and images.\n\nThere are a lot of things you can do with the Gear VR. My favorite, and probably VR at it simplest, is exploring 360-degree photos from all over the world. Pick a location, and spin around like you're there. Lose a few hours doing that, for sure.\n\nBetter still is the 360-degree artwork, for a lack of a better word. Basically, sci-fi and art scenes, but totally surrounding you. It's like stepping into some awesome sci-fi movie or game.\n\nThen there are the movies. Yep, 360-degree movies. Most are travel or sports videos, but there are a few fiction ones too, including one from Star Wars, and one with zombies.\n\nThe games, which seems like a huge selling point, are very hit-or-miss. I guess that's to be expected so early on in VR game development. Land's End is an atmospheric puzzle game from the people who made the fantastic Monument Valley. It's pretty cool, though fairly slow. Instead of walking through the world, you have to click to the next predetermined location, then the game moves you there. It works, but it's not ideal.\n\nEVE Gunjack looks cool, but it's an on-rails shooter. Not my thing, but for what it is it's cool.\n\nHonestly, I found gaming on the Gear VR to be rather boring, just like any games I'd play on my phone. I prefer something more elaborate.\n\nBut even considering that, I still love the Gear VR and have lost many hours using it. The videos and movies alone make it worth the purchase.\n\nThe refresh is high and the lag low, so most people probably won't get vertigo or feel queasy, but it's possible. Also, it's really easy for your phone to overheat, so you have to turn the brightness down, limiting some of the \"wow\" factor by reducing the OLED's contrast ratio.\n\nLastly... it's not an Oculus. At $100 of course it isn't, but having experienced the Oculus, I kept wanting to move through environments, explore these strange new worlds, and that's not possible with the processing in a phone. There are glimmers of this in some games, but for a real FPS-type game, you'll need the processing power of a PC and the Rift.\n\nIf you have one of the devices listed, absolutely get the Gear VR. If you pre-order the S7, you'll get a Gear VR for free. It's a fun diversion, and a great way to sample what the future of VR will be like (i.e. absolutely awesome).", "It was a big week in Android, but you should probably already know that. With MWC taking place, Samsung announced the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, and LG announced the G5. We were fortunate to get hands-on time with all of the phones, with videos of each encounter available for viewing.\n\nBeyond Galaxy S7 and LG G5 news, we might have gotten our first look at Android N thanks to the Android development team, Verizon has begun field testing its 5G network, NVIDIA started rolling out Marshmallow to the SHIELD Android TV, and HTC started teasing the One M10 on Twitter.

Seeing the sense in this, Samsung took a similar oath, and has so far been good on their word. That means if you've got a device that was launched as a flagship smartphone, you can expect to get the latest security patch Over The Air sometime very soon.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole \"flagship\" title is a little bit fluid. We're not exactly sure what Samsung officially considers their flagships, but generally any high-end model from 2014 and beyond seems to fit the bill. We can look to past updates to get a good idea of which models should see this security patch. The Galaxy S4 didn't make the cut, it seems, but Galaxy S5 and all variants of the Galaxy S6 did. The Note 4 and Note 5 are on the list, as are the Tab S and the Tab S2. If you're running any of these devices, we'd be surprised if Samsung skipped you for this delivery.\n\nThe OTA we're expecting will include everything Google listed on February's bulletin, but it will also cover memory corruptions and buffer overflow attack vulnerabilities that are specific to Samsung. We also expect that a number of non-disclosed bugs or safety concerns will be patched and made public after the fact.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding Samsung and Google's commitment to maintaining the security of high end devices, even years down the road?

And it's previously been reported that his personal device is a Samsung Galaxy phone.\n\nStill, the man made a pretty blunt statement about iPhones last week: Don't use them until Apple cooperates with the FBI. Apple certainly hasn't done that yet, so what's the deal?\n\nMaybe Trump -- whose net worth is reportedly $4.5 billion -- doesn't have enough conviction in his own viewpoints to buy a couple of new smartphones for his communications team. Or maybe he thinks it's more important for everyday voters to boycott Apple than it is for upper-crust types who actually have the resources to switch smartphones -- devices that cost hundreds of dollars -- on a whim.\n\nWhile Trump flip-flops constantly, this situation actually offered him a chance to be consistent for once.

Foxconn mentioned that it responded to Sharp on the same day that the content needed to be clarified before a deal could be signed. The company has also stated that it is hoping to clear up the matter as soon as possible. After the agreement has been given the green light once more, Foxconn will acquire two-thirds of Sharp, which would issue around $4.4 billion worth of new shares to the company Foxconn.

In addition, Gavin Parry, managing director of Parry International Trading, a brokers firm situated in Hong Kong, has shared positive remarks towards Sharp's direction:\n\n\"Sharp has the technology to build out the components to compete with Samsung as an Apple supplier, which means that with Sharp under its umbrella Foxconn can help Apple wean itself off Samsung.

The only surviving claims are those of breach of contract on the nine trusts, which the banks did not seek to dismiss.\n\nNCUA spokesman John Fairbanks said the regulator is reviewing the decision.\n\nBank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of many in which the NCUA has sought to recoup losses on mortgage securities bought before the financial crisis, and which led to the 2009 and 2010 failures of the Constitution Corporate, Members United Corporate, Southwest Corporate, U.S. Central and Western Corporate credit unions.\n\nThe NCUA has recouped close to $2.46 billion through lawsuits it began filing in 2011, including $33 million this week from Switzerland's UBS.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nAlso in Business\n\n\u25cf A U.S. appeals court on Friday overturned a $120 million jury verdict against Samsung, finally handing the South Korean smartphone maker a significant win in its long-standing patent feud with top rival Apple.

It also ruled that two other patents covering the iPhone's slide-to-unlock and auto-correct features were invalid. The court also said Apple was liable for infringing one of Samsung's patents.\n\n\u25cf American consumers lost a little confidence this month amid worries that slowing economic growth will hurt the job market, the University of Michigan says.

The court found two of Apple's patents, including one for its slide-to-unlock feature, to be invalid and a third wasn't infringed.\n\nToday's ruling overturns a verdict reached by a California jury in May 2014, which found Samsung devices to infringe on Apple's patents. It also upholds a decision to make Apple pay Samsung $158,400 in damages for infringing on its video compression patent.\n\nIn this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers that can then be touched to make phone calls. The autocorrect patent is invalid and the detection patent wasn't infringed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted on its electronic docket. The court upheld the jury's verdict that two other Apple patents, for universal search and background syncing, weren't infringed.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the similar but separate ongoing patent suit between Apple and Samsung.

A lower court ruling said Samsung's mobile devices infringed on Apple's quick links, slide-to-unlock, and autocorrect patents -- a ruling the Appeals Court felt was off base.\n\nAppeals Court overturns Apple's win in second Samsung patent infringement case\n\nThe Appeals Court found Samsung wasn't infringing on the quick links patent, and declared the slide-to-unlock and autocorrect patents invalid, according to Reuters. The patents in question included:\n\n5,946,647 - System and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data 8,046,721 - Unlocking a device by performing gestures on an unlock image 8,074,172 - Method, system, and graphical user interface for providing word recommendations\n\nThis was the second big U.S. infringement case between the two companies. A Federal jury ruled in 2014 mostly in Apple's favor and awarded the iPhone and iPad maker $119.6 million in damages for Samsung's infringement on multiple patents. The same jury found that Apple infringed on one of Samsung's patents and awarded the electronics maker $158,400 in damages.\n\nThis case was similar to a 2012 patent infringement trial where a jury found Samsung infringed on a long list of Apple's patents and that Apple didn't infringe on any of Samsung's. Apple was awarded $1.1 billion in damages, but that was later lowered to $980 million.\n\nSamsung held out on paying Apple but finally agreed to hand over $548.2 million last December on the condition it gets that back, plus interest, should the courts overturn the original ruling. Samsung is currently waiting to see if the U.S. Supreme Court will hear its appeal.\n\nSamsung's tactics have rendered Apple's court room wins as mostly symbolic because it hasn't been blocked from selling devices ruled as infringing. Apple did finally win a permanent injunction in January blocking Samsung from selling specific mobile devices in the U.S, but that will have little impact because most of those aren't available any more.\n\nThat injunction was part of the case where Samsung just won its appeal, and now that two of the patents in that case have been ruled invalid it has even less value. Apple's consolation is that it did win the injunction, which is something it might be able to note in future patent infringement cases.\n\nIn the end it looks like Samsung's long time legal tactics will prevail: drag the litigation out as long as possible so any wins its opponents get are hollow, and don't worry about those silly patents. They just get in the way.", "The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are the latest and greatest smartphones from Samsung.\n\nThe South Korean firm's new devices tick a number of wish list items, including a water resistant design, always-on display, better camera - and expandable storage via microSD card.\n\nUsers can top-up the 32GB of in-built storage with memory cards up to 200GB.\n\nIn Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Google introduced a clever new feature called Adoptable Storage that merges the internal storage with the microSD card, so it shows up as one save location.", "You may already know that Samsung is throwing in a free Gear VR headset with every Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge pre-order, regardless of market.

And last fall, Apple boosted the resolution on the iPhone camera, narrowing one of the major gaps it had with Samsung.\n\nWith the S7, Samsung is lowering its camera's resolution -- you read that right -- to match the iPhone's 12 megapixels.\n\nTo be sure, there are key differences. Only the latest iPhones have special features you activate by pressing harder on an icon or link, while Samsung is among the biggest boosters of virtual reality.\n\nIt's too early to say which phone is better. Though Samsung announced the S7 on Sunday at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, the phone isn't coming out until March 11. My hands-on time has been limited to controlled settings.\n\nAnd for most users it may end up being a draw -- Samsung leads the pack among Android phones, while Apple has its own self-contained ecosystem, iOS. For many, a choice between the two could come down to preference for one system or another -- and the apps available for each.\n\nFor now, here's how Apple and Samsung phones stack up:\n\nCamera: For both, the rear cameras are now at 12 megapixels -- up from 8 for iPhones and down from 18 for Samsung. That doesn't mean Samsung photos are getting worse, though.\n\nIn making the change, Samsung adopted the iPhone's 4-by-3 dimension, ditching the widescreen format it had long used. Widescreen produces vertical shots that are awkwardly tall, such that I've had to crop them to 4-by-3 anyway. The 6-megapixel reduction is equivalent to chopping off the excess.\n\nThe front cameras are both at 5 megapixels. Apple also turned the screen into a flash for selfies. Samsung, ever the fast follower, is now doing the same with the S7.\n\nSamsung is promising improvements in low-light shots, borrowing techniques from full-bodied SLR cameras. Even with last year's models, Samsung cameras tend to produce brighter night shots than the iPhone. But I've also seen more distortion when those shots are blown up. We'll see if that's been fixed with the S7.\n\nSize: Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 is slightly larger and heavier than the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s, but not much so.\n\nThere's a premium version of the S7 called the S7 Edge; both sides curve like a waterfall, such that the screen flows over the side to the back of the phone. The Edge screen is 5.5 inches, but much of that comes from the curvature. The phone itself is taller, but just a tad wider and heavier.\n\nCompared with the 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, though, the S7 Edge is smaller.\n\nExtras: Neither the iPhone nor the S7 lets you replace the battery. But the S7 does let you add storage. And the base model is 32 gigabytes, double what the iPhone offers for starters.\n\nUnlike the iPhone, the S7 is waterproof. There's no need to keep USB and other ports sealed, as past waterproof phones did. The S7 also offers wireless charging; you simply lay the phone flat on a charging base.\n\nApple and Samsung both let you unlock phones with your fingerprint rather than a pass code. And both let you make payments with a tap at some retail stores.\n\nShortcuts: The latest iPhones and the S7 Edge have shortcuts to common tasks, such as taking selfies. With the iPhone, you hard press on an app icon. With the Edge, you swipe from the right edge. That swipe also gets you headlines, frequent contacts and favorite apps.\n\nApple lets third-party app makers create their own shortcuts, while Samsung does not.\n\nThe screen: While the iPhone and most other phones use LCD screens, Samsung uses AMOLED, for active-matrix organic light-emitting diodes. Colors are more vivid, though sometimes unnatural. Individual pixels produce their own light, and no energy is needed to light pixels that are black. LCDs require blacklighting, which uses energy regardless.\n\nIn practice, Samsung is able to offer an always-on mode in the S7, constantly displaying a clock, notifications and other highlights when the phone is locked. Because most of the screen is dark, the screen should sip rather than drain power in this mode.\n\nVirtual reality: Samsung is ahead of Apple, though it faces competition from other Android manufacturers, including LG.\n\nSamsung already has its own VR headset, while LG is coming out with one. They won't work with each other's phones or any other Android phone.\n\nBoth companies will soon sell 360-degree cameras for taking VR video.\n\nAvailability: The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have been available since September. Advance orders for the S7 phones started this week. March 11 is the release date in the U.S. and several other markets.", "Mark Furler Mark Furler is APN Australian Regional Media's group digital editor.

You even have a 'Friends Manager' app on your phone to quickly connect and control them all.\n\nTop of the range is the Rolling Bot, a ball-shaped drone that can take photos and video, chase your cat, tease it with a red laser light on the floor, or remotely control your TV and audio equipment.\n\nIt hooks up to your wireless network at home and can be controlled via your G5 from anywhere you have a connection.\n\nThe built-in camera can shoot 1080p video or 8-megapixel stills and it comes with 512MB of RAM, and a bundled 16GB microSD card. It is expected to sell for about $US500 later this year.\n\nLG's range also includes a VR headset which is a lot slimmer and lighter than Samsung's Gear VR. There's also a new attachment to your phone for photography which includes easier controls and extra battery life.\n\nLG also unveiled a 360 degree camera and plug in module developed by Bang & Olufsen's to deliver high-end 32 bit DAC sound to your phone via a headset or your home stereo.\n\nBut when it comes to phones, Samsung's spectacular Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will be hard to beat in 2016.\n\nThe S7 features one of the best cameras ever released with extreme low light capabilities and super quick focus.\n\nThe new Galaxy edge has a stunning curved display, better battery life, water and dust resistance and the return of the microSD card.\n\nSamsung too has its own clever little ball which is designed to capture 360 degree vision from two 180 degree cameras shooting images up to 15 megapixels.\n\nIts video capability is just shy of 4k quality.\n\nWhat makes the Gear 360 particularly clever is the way you can 'stitch' images and video from the two cameras together - all on your Samsung smartphone.\n\nYou can even share it straight to a Gear Virtual Reality headset - or to others via 360 capabilities in Facebook and Youtube.\n\nSamsung and Facebook see 2016 being the year of an explosion in virtual reality devices and 360 degree videos.\n\nThose who order the S7 in the next couple of months will be given a Gear VR reality headset worth more than $150.\n\nOTHER COOL STUFF WE CHECKED OUT\n\nSony Ear: Is a small Bluetooth device which sits in your ear and synced to your smartphone.

Here are the top stories of the week.\n\n1. Apple continued its battle with the FBI amid an order to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists involved in the San Bernardino shooting. In a company email, Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked employees for their support. The email paints the issue of Apple's refusal to cooperate as one of civil liberties. Apple then filed a motion to dismiss the court order forcing it to unlock the phone, citing constitutional free speech rights. Apple hinges its argument on the fact that the FBI Is attempting to expand the use of the All Writs Act. A pro-Apple rally took place in downtown San Francisco, and we talked to a few anti-FBI protestors to see what they had to say about the issue.\n\n2. Some of our staff went to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress 2016. We covered a panel about mobile ad blocking, Mark Zuckerberg talked about Free Basics and encryption, Samsung announced the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, we went hands on with the modular LG G5 and, oh, by the way, tablets are dead. You can find our full coverage of MWC 2016 here.\n\n3. Facebook launched its \"Reactions\" extension to the Like button, allowing users to express Love, Wow, Haha, Angry and Sad emotions in addition to the original Like.\n\n4. While Uber launched a motorbike taxi on-demand service in Thailand, things weren't great for the company this week. Uber confirmed that one of its drivers, Jason Dalton, is the suspect in a shooting rampage that took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Dalton allegedly picked up riders and pocketed fares in between the shootings. He had passed Uber's background check and had no prior criminal record. Uber then clarified that Dalton had a 4.73 rating and had given more than 100 rides.\n\n5. IBM unveiled a rush of deals that underscore another major aspect of the growth of mobile: the rise of cloud services. The company unveiled deeper partnerships with Apple, VMware, GitHub, Bitly and Siemens.\n\n6. We learned that Didi Kuaidi, the company that has left Uber eating its dust in China, is currently in the midst of securing $1 billion in additional fundraising. We've heard that round is not yet closed, is apparently over-subscribed and will value the company at more than $20 billion.\n\n7. Snapchat introduced another revenue stream in the form of on-demand geofilters. Now, anyone can pay to design their own geofilter, and it's pretty easy to do. Here's how it works.\n\n8. CrunchNetwork contributor Tom Giovanetti wrote about how to solve the H-1B visa problem. \"Of all the controversial elements of proposed immigration reform plans, the H-1B visa impasse should be the easiest to solve,\" he writes.\n\n9. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron formally announced the date for a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union. On June 23, British voters will be asked \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" The outcome will have a huge impact on the country's tech ecosystem and the U.K.'s position as a leading tech hub in Europe and beyond, explains Steve O'Hear.\n\n10. Life is just one big game of laser tag with Father.io. We got a chance to play with an early prototype of the company's Inceptor smartphone dongle and its augmented reality massive multiplayer first-person shooter app. The company launched an Indiegogo campaign this week.\n\n11. In little over a month, shares in LinkedIn lost over half their value -- because of poor growth forecasts, fears over future income and even investor concerns over a tech bubble. The issues facing LinkedIn, however, go beyond the company itself, explains contributor Damian Kimmelman.", "These Chicago teens can't graduate until they learn some compsci\n\nA US appeals court has handed Samsung a legal victory in its never-ending patent war with Apple.\n\nThe Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned an infringement verdict against Samsung and invalidated two other patent claims made by Apple related to the operation of smartphones.\n\nThe court now says that Samsung did not infringe on Apple's US patent 5,946,647 and invalidated Apple patent claims on patents 8,046,721 and 8,074,172, preventing the company from collecting damages.\n\nA 2014 US District Court jury verdict ruled that Samsung had infringed on the 647, 721 and 172 patents and awarded Apple a $119.6m payout.\n\nAdditionally, the court upheld a counter-infringement claim Samsung made against Apple for its own patent 6,226,449 and upheld a damage claim of $158,400 to Samsung.\n\nIn short, Samsung goes from being down $120m to Apple to getting a $158,000 payout. The monetary decision will barely register for either company, as Samsung made a $5.05bn profit last quarter and Apple reported $18.4bn.\n\nThe victory does, however, give Samsung important points in its years-long patent war with Apple. The two sides have been battling it out in courts over multiple accusations of patent infringement between their respective Android and iOS smartphone and tablet lines.\n\nApple late last year finally claimed victory in an earlier case when Samsung said it would cough up a $548m patent infringement bill to Cupertino, though it is still holding out hope that the US Supreme Court will agree to hear one final appeal in that case. \u00ae", "\"Outside conservative groups overwhelm Arkansas judge races\": The Associated Press has\n\nAccording to the article, \"the barrage is focused on two state Supreme Court races that have become Arkansas' most fiercely fought contests, thanks to the ramped up efforts of outside conservative groups to reshape the nation's state courts by shattering spending records.\"\n\nPosted at 04:18 PM by Howard Bashman\n\nAnd Reuters has a report headlined \"Supreme Court justice candidate list still open: White House.\"\n\nPosted at 04:16 PM by Howard Bashman\n\nSusan Decker of Bloomberg News reports that \"Apple Loses Appeal in $119.6 Million Samsung Smartphone Case.\"\n\nReuters reports that \"Samsung wins appeal in patent dispute with Apple.\"\n\nJoe Mullin of Ars Technica reports that \"Apple's $120M jury verdict against Samsung destroyed on appeal; Apple's autocorrect and 'slide to unlock' are invalid in light of prior art.\"\n\nAnd at Fortune.com, Don Reisinger reports that \"Samsung Wins Appeal In $120M Patent Fight With Apple.\"\n\nYou can access today's ruling of a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit at this link.\n\nPosted at 02:10 PM by Howard Bashman\n\nAnd The Associated Press has a report headlined \"Group: Ruling may leave Louisiana with 1 abortion clinic.\"\n\nMy earlier coverage of Wednesday's Fifth Circuit stay ruling can be accessed here.\n\nPosted at 01:35 PM by Howard Bashman\n\nHoward Mintz of The San Jose Mercury News reports that \"San Jose Judge Lucy Koh nominated to federal appeals court.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reports that \"Obama nominates Silicon Valley judge to appellate court.\"\n\nAt Fortune.com, Jeff John Roberts reports that \"White House to Promote Silicon Valley's Most Famous Judge.\"\n\nAnd at her \"Trial Insider\" blog, Pamela A.

Samsung just released their VR camera, the [Gear 360], and LG just released a VR camera called [LG 360 CAM] as well. LG's camera is, shall we say, very INSPIRED by Ricoh's design. But the Ricoh Theta was first. By a mile. By several years and a whole new iteration, in fact.\n\nMost people hadn't heard of the Oculus Rift, much less realize that other companies would be able to profit from the VR market that was just about to launch.\n\nIn 2014 Ricoh revealed the Theta M15, and in 2015 came the Ricoh Theta S. While most companies that are now testing the waters with 360-degree/spherical photography and videography cameras have made one iteration so far, some haven't released any to the market, and Ricoh is already on generation 3!\n\nBelow you'll see how the Ricoh Theta S has camera lenses on two of its sides. On the edge of the camera you'll find metal buttons, one to turn the device on, another to connect to your smartphone via Wi-Fi, and a third to switch between photo and video capture.\n\nYou do not need to use this third button if you're controlling the camera from your smartphone exclusively.\n\nWhat's awesome about the Ricoh Theta S - right after the fact that it captures spherical photos - is the fact that it captures said photos so extremely quickly.\n\nAs quick as you're able to push the big ol' shutter button, you'll hear a sound something like a \"shhplink!\" and the photo will have been taken. It'll catch you off guard. You'll think \"there's no way it took a photo that fast that's even worth looking at.\"\n\nBut it does.\n\nABOVE: You can output the media you capture through a smartphone app (iOS or Android) via the web, or you can move photos and video to your desktop computer with a standard micro-USB cord. You can also view media on your TV straight from the camera, if you feel so inclined, via a mini-HDMI port.\n\nThe Ricoh Theta S is able to capture images at 14-megapixel resolution and can capture video at 1080p/30fps. This device has two f/2.0 lenses to capture this media.\n\nIt's not a miracle-maker.\n\nIt doesn't capture images or video that are going to win you any national media prizes for most fantastically well composed shot.\n\nBut the Ricoh Theta S represents a piece of equipment that'll change your perception of the world around you - insofar as how you're able to capture that word and share it with the world, that is.\n\nIt's so extremely easy and quick to use, anyone can do it.\n\nThis device has 8GB internal storage inside - which is fine so long as you're willing to transfer data to your smartphone every once in a while, or empty the whole device out to your desktop computer at the end of each day.\n\nIt's not like you're going to fill this 8GB up in an hour's time - far from it - but at the end of a day capturing video and photos in a very photogenic place, you'll fill this device up easy.\n\nAbove you'll see a photo of NASA's Orion Spacecraft - non-flight model for training and development purposes - at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nThe above two images were captured in some rather high-light areas. The dog photo was captured in the afternoon on a very bright day - it'd snowed outside so there was more light than I knew what to do with. So the photography conditions were fairly ideal.\n\nThe image above was captured at Space Center Houston, aka the Official Visitor Center of the NASA Johnson Space Center. You'll notice that the imagery is a little bit more muddy than the highly-lit photos above.\n\nAbove you'll see another image from the Space Center Houston - here we get an idea of what it'd be like to watch an orientation at - for instance - your college, when you're at home sick in bed.\n\nBelow you'll see the Rock Yard - this is where the Mars Rover is tested at Johnson Space Center. Crushing rocks and such.\n\nNext you'll see a video. The Ricoh Theta S does not do as well with video as it does with photos. This camera can capture a far larger image in a single frame - a photo - than it can in an array of frames - a video. At the moment, this camera is not ideal for video, that much is true.\n\nThe video you're seeing was captured inside the Mars Rover from the passenger seat. I trusted the Ricoh Theta S to capture media at this once in a lifetime experience, and I was not left disappointed.\n\nBelow you'll see another video from inside the same space vehicle. This one is back further in the vehicle, so there's even less light available to the camera.\n\nWhile the quality might not be top notch for spherical video here with the Ricoh Theta S, the speed with which it is captured - and the ease with which it is captured - has not yet been beat.\n\nWhile video quality is wanting, the photos this device captures now are quite nice. I expect that a year down the line this model will look slightly less impressive - especially now that players like Samsung and LG are jumping in on the party - but for now, the Ricoh Theta S is top notch.\n\nAnd again - Ricoh deserves major props for stabbing this sort of device right in the heart well before the competition. They saw the future before basically anybody else. Well done!\n\nThe Ricoh Theta S will cost you $349 USD, and it's available right this minute online.", "Seoul's main bourse recovered for the second day in a row, thanks largely to rising oil prices.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose 2.9 percent to $33.07 a barrel on Thursday, as Venezuela raised hopes for a production limit.\n\nThe benchmark Kospi closed at 1,920.16, up 1.59 points or 0.08 percent from the previous trading day.

The market became more competitive in terms of price and Sharp wasn't the best placed to deal with that,\" he said.\n\nSharp's key technological blessing today has also proven to be a curse: It produces LCD screens favored by industry giants Apple and Samsung, but lacks the huge research and development funds necessary to keep ahead of the competition.\n\nIn 2012, a state-backed fund created Japan Display, which aimed to merge Sharp's small- and medium-sized LCD screen business with those of rivals Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba.\n\nThe new company was seen as a way for Japanese firms to mount a strong challenge to overseas rivals. But Sharp refused to take part.\n\n\"LCD was absolutely central to Sharp so (a merger) was tough to accept,\" Makabe said.\n\nBut the firm was not in a position to buy out its local LCD competitors, he added.\n\nSharp's decision to sell to a Taiwanese firm made clear it was turning its back on a common move by Japanese firms to merge in a bid to fend off overseas competition.\n\n\"This sort of consolidation probably wouldn't be workable,\" said Kunio Saijo, a senior technology journalist at the leading Nikkei business daily, before the Hon Hai deal was announced.\n\nMakabe at Shinshu University said the offer from Hon Hai's colorful billionaire founder Terry Gou was \"financially superior,\" and noted that both firms count iPhone Apple as a major client.\n\nThe Japan-based solution \"would also have meant the involvement of (Sharp's creditor) banks, which wouldn't have been ideal,\" he added.\n\nBut even a foreign buy-out does not guarantee Sharp's future.\n\nLCD technology is facing a stiff challenge from rival technologies including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Sharp and Hon Hai plan to invest billions of dollars in OLED technology.", "For obvious reasons, businesses are rarely inclined to work closely with their competitors. The fear that rivals will discover R&D secrets, poach customers or infringe on their intellectual property (IP) makes most companies highly suspicious of working with \"the enemy.\"\n\nKeep Your Friends Close and Your Enemies ...\n\nThe idea of collaborating with rival firms would be anathema to many business leaders -- and these rivalries often extend beyond pure economic protectionism into personal dislike.\n\nTake the long standing antagonism between Apple and Microsoft. Although Bill Gates said there was no need for forgiveness between himself and Steve Jobs back in 2011, the competition between the pair bordered at times on viciousness. Or how about the long running court cases between Apple and another competitor -- Samsung -- over patents and IP around their respective smartphones.\n\nNevertheless, despite competition and the drive for profit, businesses have, on occasion, opened up to their competitors.\n\nTake Microsoft. In recent years it has opened up much of its once jealously held IP and products to third parties. The Office range is now freely available on Android and iOS, and under Satya Nadella, much source code for key products has been released for anyone, anywhere to edit as they please. Most recently, Microsoft released its source code for deep learning on GitHub.\n\nFrom Ivory Towers to Wall Street\n\nAlthough businesses and research universities have fundamentally different goals and ways of working, they do share certain features in common. Just as businesses aim to attract the best employees in their respective fields, universities boost their prestige by hiring big name professors.\n\nUniversity research departments are in a constant state of competition for funding for research projects, pitting them against universities in other cities and countries. Businesses compete against one another for market share. And of course universities want to boast the biggest and most significant discoveries in their field, just as businesses aim to produce the best products and services.\n\nThe structure and history of many of the world's leading campuses is long, bureaucratic and far removed from the world of enterprise in many ways. Nonetheless, there are many things they can learn from one another. In the case of collaboration, universities have a long history of inter-institutional cooperation (not to mention competition), and private companies could learn a lot from their experience.\n\nWhy Collaborate with Competitors at All?\n\nIn Europe, the ERASMUS program, named after Dutch philosopher Erasmus of Rotterdam, who studied at a variety of the continent's universities, has seen tens of thousands of students and professors spending semesters abroad throughout Europe since 1987 (your trusty correspondent did just this in Spain). Meanwhile, students and professors in the US have regularly travelled across the world on Fulbright scholarships since 1946, and UMAP has facilitated international study in the Asia-Pacific region since the early 1990s.", "While many mobile device makers attended Mobile World Congress 2016, arguably it was Samsung and LG that introduced the two most interesting smartphones at the show. Although both showcased many products, including 360-degree cameras, their new, high-end smartphones received the most attention.

All three phones represent the latest and best the Android ecosystem has to offer right now with their high-end displays, solid specs and appealing designs. But Samsung and LG tossed in some additional features to differentiate their smartphone designs. With its curved screen, the Galaxy S7 Edge offers more productive display real estate, and thanks to a new modular design, the G5 can be expanded to use accessories, such as external cameras or sound equipment. We compare the new Galaxy S7 smartphones and LG G5 handsets to help buyers determine which alternative might best fit their needs.

The court also said Apple was liable for infringing one of Samsung's patents.\n\nA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment, while a representative for Samsung said she did not have an immediate comment on the decision.\n\nApple and Samsung have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years.

Reuters reports that in today's decision, which also affirmed the smaller decision against Apple, the court reasoned that Samsung had not infringed on one patent, and that other patents were invalid.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal on another case, where the company was again found to have infringed on Apple patents. In that decision, which dates back to a lawsuit from 2011, Samsung agreed to pay $548 million, while saying that the Supreme Court hearing may change the situation.", "NORRISTOWN >> A Conshohocken man potentially faces jail time after he admitted to possessing child pornography on his cell phone and computer tablet.\n\nMatthew Donald Benson, 24, of the 1800 block of Butler Pike, pleaded guilty in Montgomery County Court on Friday to felony charges of possessing child pornography and criminal use of a communication facility in connection with incidents that occurred between October 2014 and February 2015. Judge Thomas P. Rogers deferred sentencing so that court officials can complete a background investigative report about Benson.\n\nBenson also must undergo a psychosexual evaluation prior to sentencing, the judge said.\n\nBenson faces a possible maximum sentence of seven to 14 years in prison on the charges. However, state sentencing guidelines would allow for less jail time.\n\nAn investigation of Benson began in October 2014 when investigators working with an Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force discovered several child pornographic images were uploaded to a particular Internet address that was later linked to Benson.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2015, detectives went to Benson's residence with a search warrant and Benson did not deny detectives access to his home, court documents indicate.\n\n\"While speaking with Benson he did admit he had viewed child porn via his cell phone and Samsung tablet,\" county detectives wrote in the arrest affidavit, adding Benson denied having any file sharing programs on his electronics devices.\n\nA forensic examination of the devices seized from Benson uncovered 67 images on his cell phone that depicted children under the age of 18 engaged in sexual acts or posing naked, according to the criminal complaint. Detectives also recovered three videos depicting child pornography on the computer tablet, court documents indicate.", "This marks the first significant win for Samsung in a legal dispute with Apple since the dispute between the two companies began in 2011. Apple is very likely to pursue an appeal if possible, in an effort to defend its \"quick links\" patent that was the centerpiece of the second trial -- which covered other patents and products than the first patent trial. The Appeals court also ruled that the \"slide-to-unlock\" and \"auto-correct\" patents that the jury found Samsung guilty of copying were invalid, effectively nullifying the jury award.", "\"A U.S. appeals court on Friday overturned a $120 million jury verdict against Samsung,\" Andrew Chung reports for Reuters.\n\n\"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd did not infringe Apple's \"quick links\" patent, and that two other patents covering the iPhone's slide-to-unlock and auto-correct features were invalid.

Apple has already won this war in dominating fashion.\n\nWhat happens when a company like Apple enters a market an totally disrupts it? Either the law is applied justly or the entire industry that faces annihilation bands together to steal Apple's IP while working protect each other (buying patents for defense, filing amicus briefs, denial, running PR campaigns, buying advertising to create complicit media outlets, clouding the issue with specious claims, hatching legal maneuvers to draw out the process, etc.). This is what happened with the Mac. This is what happened with the iPhone. And, get ready, this is what will likely happen if Apple enters the vehicle market, too.\n\nThe main reason why Samsung et al. were able to sell phones and tablets at all was because they made fake iPhones and iPads designed to fool the unwitting (who are now finally waking up in droves) in much the same way as how Microsoft et al. profited wildly from upside-down and backwards fake Macs at the end of the 20th century. Google, Samsung, HTC, Xiaomi, et al. are the Microsofts, HPs, Dells, and eMachines of the new century.\n\nApple's products came first, then Samsung's:\n\nFor good measure, here's what Google's Android looked like before and after Apple's iPhone:\n\nAnd, here's what cellphones looked like before and after Apple's iPhone:\n\nPeople who buy Android phones and tablets reward thieves.\n\n[Thanks to MacDailyNews Readers \"Fred Mertz\" and \"JayinDC\" for the heads up.]", "Daryl Deino Actor, Writer, Pop Culture Enthusiast, Technology Addict\n\nI once considered the Samsung Gear VR the most innovative tech device since the iPad in 2001. The Gear VR went with me everywhere. I bought the developer's version in December of 2014 and the commercial version last November. I never thought I would get bored of it, but I have; it's is in my room gathering dust. As a matter of fact, when I went to test out a new app this morning, I had to wipe the lenses.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the Gear VR really is an innovative device and Samsung deserves a lot of credit for helping Oculus build a device for mobile VR. When I first got it, my eyes spent hours viewing movies in the VR Cinema. It was so cool to have my own virtual IMAX movie theater. It was also cool to visit China, New York City, and even Africa just by putting on the headset. Did I mention that both you and a friend who is thousands of miles away can visit the moon together while watching video clips and chatting, provided that both of you have the Gear VR?\n\nThe problem is that although all this is exciting at first, the rather poor quality of the experiences seeps in and, eventually, these experiences become too much of a hassle. The biggest problem is what is called the \"screen door effect,\" where one can easily see individual pixels that build up an image. It's like looking at something through a screen door. A Quad HD resolution screen may look beautiful on a smartphone from a foot away, but when that screen is magnified in front of your eyes, things are different.\n\nPerhaps, a 4K screen would take care of the screen door effect, but a 4K smartphone screen eats up a lot of battery life and isn't necessary for 95 percent of smartphone users. Still, this is needed to make what's supposed to be an immersive experience more immerse.\n\nThe most annoying problem with the Gear VR (and this includes every version that has been released so far) is that the lenses fog up really easily. Sometimes, it gets so annoying that you just want to take the Gear VR off your head and throw it across the room. I have found a solution that usually helps: Rain-X Interior Glass Anti-Fog. But why should somebody have to spend money on this after they already spend more than $100 (it used to be more than $200) on the headset?\n\nThen, there is what is commonly know as the FOV (field-of-view), which determines the widest dimension your eyes can see an image. While the Gear VR does provide somewhat of an immersive experience, it looks like you are seeing that experience through an igloo helmet. However, it gets worse. Because of the light reflection, your eyes will notice two transparent dark squares on the sides of the image. They aren't that prominent, but they are there. When you look to the right one, it disappears and the same goes with the left one. But in the virtual reality world, you need to be able to look in the center.\n\nIn order to get rid of these transparent and annoying black squares, I have tried to put a couple of bandages on my nose, which sometimes works, but makes the headset feel more uncomfortable. Once again, why should I have to make the compromise? Why should the consumer have to make all these compromises? The Gear VR is supposed to be about enjoyment, but it's become a tough job to get it to work correctly.\n\nPerhaps I am being a little too harsh. After all, most people I have showed the device to have been blown away -- at least at first. I dare anybody not to be totally impressed with the Jurassic World VR app, which has an Apatosaurus staring right at you, centimeters away from mistaking you as a vegetable. There is also Temple Run VR, which makes you really feel like you are running away from monsters. The Netflix app is also enjoyable, just as long as you don't watch anything more than a half hour.\n\nHowever, VR is a very important type of techology. It has failed for decades and only now does it have a chance of taking off. If consumers experience mediocre virtual reality experiences like they do with the Google Cardboard or frustrating experiences with the Gear VR, they may not give the technology a chance when it is perfected. Hopefully, the upcoming Oculus Rift can correct at least some of the ills of the Gear VR and bring virtual reality to the mainstream.", "Here's our recap of what happened in online marketing today, as reported on Marketing Land and other places across the web.\n\nFrom Marketing Land: Amazon To Webstore Sellers: No New Orders As Of May 1st, Two Months Ahead Of Platform Closure\n\nFeb 26, 2016 by Ginny Marvin\n\nMigration deadline effectively moves up by 60 days.

It simulates a virtual living room to sit in and watch Netflix on a virtual screen.\n\nWPP's Sorrell also talked this up at the same mobile conference: \"The VR thing is really very interesting.\" But remarks were couched from a lone experience he had: \"Maybe I was just very influenced by what I saw at Sundance with Ridley Scott's film 'The Martian.'\"\n\nSorrell believes VR \"is sort of game-changing\"for advertisers. What kind of executions? He thinks a full suite of media opportunities are on the table, ncluding travel, sports, live events, gaming and entertainment. \"Fantastic,\" he says.\n\nSorrell can see WPP investing in VR because it's about stuff WPP already invests in: technology, data and content.\n\nStill, you might wonder whether advertising and/or TV-film executives are too euphoric about VR. Does it remind you of any technological media revolutions in the recent past? Is VR a little more that this year's 3D TV promise?\n\nVR proponents will say 3D was a TV technology thing, for many old technology. New virtual reality is about new tech -- now bulky-looking headsets, with the promise of sleeker consumer products down the line.\n\nHeadsets aren't my thing. I suggest waiting for holographic media. So, for example, when you enter a 7-Eleven, a scene from \"Big Bang Theory\" floats in front of your eyes -- followed by a drifting image of an orange creme Slurpee.

The case can be used to charge either of Samsung's new handsets using various wireless charging pads, such as Samsung's own model. Joining that function is an integrated 3300mAh battery adding several hours of extra run time to phone.\n\nThe new juice pack brings 11 extra hours of talk time to the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone, which translates to 4 hours of extra run time if the user is web browsing, 7 extra hours if they're playing videos, or 28 extra hours if they're playing music.\n\nThose numbers all increase a bit with the S7 Edge model: 13 hours of talk time, 5 hours of web browsing, 40 hours of music, and 11 hours of video. The case itself also serves to protect the phones from damage in the case of modest drops -- it features the maker's Impact-Isolation System, which cushions the corners and edges against impacts.\n\nThe case includes a pass through for quick charging and syncing the handsets, as well as using the buttons. The juice pack will be launched in Rose Gold and Black colors for $99.95 USD. This follows the company's recent juice pack H2Pro case for the iPhone 6 Plus announcement. Check out the timeline below for details!", "Samsung won a reversal of a $120 million patent-related fine thanks to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. The court found the iPhone's slide-to-unlock and auto-correct patents invalid. Moreover, the court said Apple was guilty of infringing on one of Samsung's patents. Samsung was initially found to violate the stated Apple patents back in 2014 and Apple was awarded $120 million in damages (far less than the iPhone-maker wanted). Earlier this year, a judge agreed with Apple's position that the fine wasn't enough and went so far as to ban some older Samsung phones from being imported to the U.S. The appeals court's decision today reverses the initial verdict. The court didn't say how the reversal will impact the import ban. Neither Apple nor Samsung provided immediate comment on the ruling.", "Microsoft, Not Apple Or Alphabet, Is Wearables King ... In Patents (Investor's Business Daily)\n\nEarlier this week, market research firm IDC published a report on the worldwide wearable device market, which saw fourth-quarter shipments rise to 27.4 million units, up 126.9 percent year-over-year, and full year shipment surge to 78.1 million units, up 171.6 percent in relation to 2014.\n\nWhile it is true that the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s Apple Watch was among the largest drivers of the aforementioned growth, analysts considered the sales figures quite disappointing - even though the company stood as the largest smartwatch vendor and the second-largest wearable devices vendor.\n\nIn fact, Apple saw its sales increase only 5 percent quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter; meanwhile, Fitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT) saw shipment rise by more than 70 percent over the period, Statista Data Journalist Felix Richter assured.\n\nMoreover, Fitbit dominated the wearables space, having shipped roughly 8.1 million units in the fourth quarter, amassing a 29.5 percent market share. Apple came in second, with a 15 percent market share. It was Xiaomi, however, that surprised the most, posting a 258.5 percent year-over-year growth in shipments; its 2.7 million units shipped in the fourth quarter helped it concentrate almost 10 percent of the market share.\n\nOther big players were SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF) and Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), with respective market shares of 4.9 percent and 3.5 percent. For the full year, market shares were pretty similar: 26.9 percent for Fitbit, 15.4 percent for Xiaomi, 14.9 percent for Apple, 4.2 percent for Garmin and 4 percent for Samsung.\n\nThe chart below shows worldwide wearable device shipments by the top five vendors in 2015.\n\nSource: Statista", "The LG 360 Cam is a pocketable VR camera that's ready to change how complicated it is to record virtual reality videos and photos.\n\nIt pairs two 13MP camera lenses on a stick, and each one is capable of capturing 200-degree wide angle photos and videos, then merging them together as one.\n\nThe stitching technology behind creating a seamless virtual reality world is sophisticated, but the user experience of this 360 camera remained fairly simple when Wi-Fi worked at MWC 2016.\n\nIt plays nicely with the forthcoming LG G5 and LG 360 VR, making it the South Korean firm's VR capturing counterweight to the Samsung Gear 360 camera.\n\nWhat's great about the LG 360 Cam is it's incredibly compact and lightweight for all of the heavy lifting that it does. I felt like I had the key to finally making virtual reality happen, all in the palm of my hand.\n\nIt's shaped like one of those FlipCams from a decade ago, but it's actually a little bit smaller at 30 x 97 x 25mm. That makes its dimensions closer to your average voice recorder.\n\nIt has style as well as size on its side. I liked the two-toned, polished metal look of the LG 360 Cam, though it's really just plastic through and through, with a rubberized frame and power button.\n\nThe dark gray-colored power button is small, but important since it doubles as a way to toggle between 360 and 180 degree photos with a long press.\n\nThe record button is even more essential, so I was glad to see that it's bigger and resides on the front of the camera, right below one of the fisheye lenses. It's easy to access for quick captures.\n\nIncredibly, the two fisheye lenses are flush with the body of the camera, and yet are able to soak in 200-degree wide photos and videos. This may be LG's biggest advantage over the more bulbose Samsung Gear 360.\n\nThe LG 360 Cam also has a protective plastic cap in dark gray. This shields its delicate glass lenses so you can stick the camera in a pocket or bag without stressing. I do worry about the delicacy of the spherical Samsung Gear 360, which doesn't have this plastic peace of mind.\n\nThe cap is smartly engineered to securely clip to the camera base, so you're not loosely carrying it around. It also acts like a handle extension tro grip. The entire ensemble measures 98.5 x 43.4 x 29.8mm and weighs 97g, which is still fairly small and light.\n\nThe bottom of the LG 360 Cam has a standard 1/4-inch tripod thread so that you can mount it on most tripods. Not visible is a trap door for a microSD card and USB-C charging.\n\nThere's a lot going on inside the LG 360 Cam in order to capture more than three times what the human eye can see.\n\nLG is touting the its two 200-degree wide angle 13MP cameras, and the fact that they're backed up by a long-lasting 1,200mAh battery. It's squeezed in between the two back-to-back lenses.\n\nYes, the battery capacity is smaller than the 2,800mAh LG G5 battery, but remember: this isn't a phone and there's no power-draining screen, or plethora of apps here. It should last you just as long as your phone, with 70 minutes of continuous video recording.\n\nMy only concern is that the battery isn't user-replaceable. The bottom of the camera has two visible screws, but this doesn't mean it's swappable like we've seen on the Samsung Gear 360.\n\nThe LG Cam 360 has its chief competition beat when it comes to storage, however. Included in its tiny body is 4GB of internal memory, in addition to accepting microSD cards.\n\nThat's a big deal for me. I can't tell you how many times I've left an SD card in my computer to transfer photos, then tried to use my DSLR camera the next day, only to realize there's no SD card in there.\n\nIts 4GB of space is basically a fail safe for people who pop out that microSD card on a regular basis. It'll be able to save at least some video and lots of photos in those desperate situations.\n\nLG Cam 360 doesn't have a microphone or headphone jack, so you won't be able to intimately narrate 2K video using this VR camera. But its embedded mics are able to pick up surrounding audio.\n\nThere are three microphones tucked into the edges of the camera lenses. It's hard to see them, and was harder to test out at noisy MWC, but they're here and poised to pick up 5.1 surround sound.\n\nThe LG 360 Cam app should look familiar because it's essentially a variant of the LG G4 and LG G5 camera app, but one that's designed with VR camera controls in mind.\n\nPhysical buttons are at a minimum on this VR camera, so it's essential that you load up this app and connect the phone with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to take advantage of manual controls.\n\nIn addition to seeing and scrolling through a live 360-degree preview image, I was able to manually adjust the shutter speed, ISO and white balance outside of the plebeian Auto mode.\n\nToggling between the 360 and 180 degree camera, and flipping the latter camera around, is all possible here, too.\n\nI'm really looking forward to using this companion app's timer button. It makes for an easy way to tap the shutter button and sprint off to appear somewhere in the 360-degree photo.\n\nOf course, taking advantage of all of these controls required pairing the LG 360 Cam and LG G5 with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and that was a special kind of complicated at the signal-busy MWC. When there aren't a dozen other devices in range, LG's Friends app promises to make the connection easier.\n\nI'll have to wait to judge it on this, but it's going to be key to the success of this VR camera. When everything does work, you'll be able to view photos and videos on more than just the LG G5 and and LG 360 VR that I tested. There's also support for Google Streetview and YouTube 360 coming to the 360 Cam.\n\nLG made a point of saying that images will also be available on other smartphones capable of 360-degree content, so we'll have to see if it plays nicely with rivals as well as it's supposed to play with friends.\n\nThe LG 360 Cam has a tremendous amount of potential because it's a virtual reality capturing tool fit for your pocket. It's smaller than the Samsung Gear 360 and, judging from my hands-on time, the dual 13MP camera seems almost as capable. In fact, the size, internal storage and protective cap make it a better VR travel companion.\n\nLG doesn't have the same inviting VR ecosystem as Samsung and its Gear VR platform, and that may end up being a reason enough to stick with LG's South Korean competitor. But if it nails compatibility, connectivity and price, the LG 360 Cam may be a virtual world changer."], "2016-02-29": ["Virtual reality is still in its early days, but it's amazing how capable it is of making your bank account look a lot less impressive.\n\nHTC revealed today that is has sold more than 15,000 HTC Vive VR kits in the first 10 minutes after it went on sale for preorder. That's not bad for an unproven technology that costs $800 and requires a $1,000 PC. This comes as companies like Facebook, Google, and Samsung are all moving into this sector. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts VR could grow into a $110 billion business by 2020 along with the similar augmented reality tech that mixes digital images with the real world -- and Vive is one of the consumer products that could drive those revenues.\n\nVive is a PC peripheral (from HTC and its partners at Valve) that you wear over your eyes and ears. This enables you to feel like you are inside of a game or a simulated experience. And unlike other VR devices, Vive has a number of extra sensors that can track your movement around a room. This amps up the feeling that you are present in another place, and it is the main selling point of the Vive compared to its competition.\n\nHTC Vive is the second major high-end VR headset to go on sale this year. In January, Oculus VR -- a subsidiary of Facebook -- starting selling its Rift head-mounted display for $600. The company didn't share any numbers about that performance, but the first shipments sold out in a matter of minutes. That pushed new orders from March into April and then into May by the end of the first day. Today, new Rift preorders won't ship until July.\n\nThese early successes are showing that VR has a lot of interest. This is something we've seen with mobile virtual reality and devices like Samsung's Gear VR (that it builds in partnership with Oculus) and the Google Cardboard phone holders. This market is on track for $861 million in spending this year.\n\nMany people have wondered if the build up to VR over the last few years will lead to any money, and now we have several products where consumers are showing they're ready to part with their cash. Now it's just up to software developers to built momentum on top of that.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists. Two albums that are very popular right now were released on Tidal, a streaming service owned by a group of artists headed by Jay-Z. One of those albums is near the top of the charts right now. The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center.

To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work.

These OEMs in question are that of Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo. Now Xiaomi has since announced its flagship Xiaomi Mi 5, so if the reports are true, it will probably be for future devices.\n\nHuawei's upcoming flagship the Huawei P9 also does not appear to sport the curved displays, according to the leaked photos, which means that just like Xiaomi, curved displays will probably be for future handsets. However Vivo is said to be utilizing the curved display in their upcoming Vivo Xplay 5, based on recently leaked photos.\n\nOf course whether or not Vivo's application of the curved display will end up being as functional as Samsung's Edge handsets remains to be seen, but what do you guys think?

The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center. The album that has a lot of critics and fans wrapped up right now is West's The Life of Pablo. To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones. Exclusive streaming deals have their own ramifications.\n\nTake for example Drake's inescapable \"Hotline Bling.\" Last fall, when the video for \"Hotline Bling\" was released, Drake was saying how much he was thirsting for a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He wrote about his desire very publicly.\n\nDrake's team gave the video to Apple Music as an exclusive -- and the strategy backfired, at least in terms of getting him to his goal of being No. 1. Apple doesn't report its video streams to Nielsen Music, so there was no chance of the song making the top spot as long as it was an Apple exclusive.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Samsung has been in talks from time to time about buying Tidal -- and sources were telling The New York Post this weekend that those talks have resumed in earnest.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists.

Because of capacity, if you do not even have a place where the FPSO can berth, then what are you talking about?

This is very important; the work we are doing in LADOL has never been done in Nigeria before.\n\n\"In a low oil price environment they are looking for cost savings and Nigerians are cheaper than South Koreans. Also, these projects are necessary to support the diversification away from oil and gas. The facility in LADOL can be used to do any kind of steel fabrication - we can do railways, we can do pre-fabrication steel for hospitals, we can build bridges and we can also do for factories.\n\n\"The cranes we have inside the facility are the heaviest in the whole of Africa, even if you go to South Africa; they do not have what we have in Nigeria now.

One would be wrong, apparently.\n\nSamsung's top-end offerings this year, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, only support QuickCharge 2.0, and not the third iteration of Qualcom's fast charging tech, optional on the Snapdragon 820. The LG G5, on the other hand, is QuickCharge 3.0-capable. 3.0 should be up to 45% more efficient than 2.0, Qualcomm's product info states, and while it can work with USB Type-C ports, implementation with the older microUSB connectors is still possible.\n\nWhy doesn't the S7 support it then, we're asking ourselves, and one potential reason is that the coexistence of Snapdragon and Exynos powered S7's calls for a unification of charging standards and the Exynos 8890 is not fully compliant with Qualcomm's specifications.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of a QuickCharge 3.0 badge on Samsung's phones doesn't necessarily mean that the S7 and S7 edge won't charge equally fast - after all, the Koreans have had a similar (and compatible) solution to Qualcomm's for past generations of Exynos-powered devices, and chargers have been interchangeable between the differently specced versions.\n\nStill, this makes for a nice argument for the LG side in the G5 vs. S7 battery debate, alongside the fact that the G5's power pack is removable, while the Galaxies have their cells sealed in.

Currently, only American Express is supported in Canada.\n\nThe MasterCard roadmap also shows Samsung Pay as being on the company's agenda, which has already been announced by Samsung, perhaps lending some credibility to the document's validity.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple Pay launched in China with UnionPay credit and debit cards, while Apple has continued to expand the service in the United States, brining it to handfuls of new banks and credit unions at a time.\n\nWe reached out to MasterCard and will update if we hear back.", "An increasing number of pedestrians fall victim to dangerous accidents because they are distracted by their smartphones.

They have taken to Twitter to share their disgust and disappointment of this potential change in the system\n\nEarlier this month, it was revealed that 45 percent of all iPhone users think Androids are 'more advanced'.\n\nThese findings come from a survey conducted by OnePulse, which asked 1,500 iPhone and Android users through its app.\n\nAndroid Authority announced their findings last weekend, as they had 'received word from two separate sources that they pre-release Android N builds currently do not include an app drawer'. But suggests that Google could even 're-add' the feature before new Android's preview is sent around this year\n\nForty percent of everyone surveyed, both iPhone and Android users, agreed Android was more advanced, 31 percent agreed and the rest had no comment.\n\nThe results were surprising considering the success Apple has been having, reports International Business Times.\n\nIts first quarter results for this year showed, Apple sold 74.78 million iPhones - the most it has ever sold in a quarter.\n\nThe app drawer is what, among other features, separates Android from the iOS. This allows users to decide how they want to handle the apps on their phone, you can either have them laid out in plain sight like the iOS or access all of them via the app drawer, which is missing from the dashboard in the video on Twitter\n\nAnd it is considered the number one gadget bran on Facebook by more than 400 million people.\n\nRegardless of how many people praise Android, it still doesn't convince anyone that Google's offerings will rise up.\n\nThe HTC One X9 has removed its app drawer, but allows users to decide if they want to enable it. The Sony Xperia X series is still equipped with the feature, 'the software is non-final and the Sony Marshmallow concept doing the rounds includes the option for a \"classic\" or \"modern\" layout - with or without an app drawer\n\nSixty-eight percent believe iPhones will always be more popular than Android and 81 percent of Android users agreed.\n\nEven if Android end up losing the app drawer, they will be getting the new WhatsApp emoji in four months.\n\nWhatsApp is rolling out a host of new emoji as part of the next Android update and users will soon have new ways to express how they feel through icons such as nerd face and a middle finger.\n\nBut one Android owner points out that the dashboard on the phone in the clip says 'Search' where the one they own says 'Google', which points to the idea this video could just be a mock-up. Android users are upset about the' might be change', as this is one of the many reasons why they choose to own an Android\n\nAccording to website Android Police, the new suite of icons has been available for the past two months as part of a beta release of the update.\n\nThe latest update of the Android app (2.12.441) has now started rolling out to all users, and will include emoji such as robot faces, popcorn and upside down faces.\n\nThe release is similar to that recently rolled out for iOS 9.1, which included the long-awaited middle finger emoji, as well as a range of activities and food and drink.", "Government and major companies seek deals in the 'promised land' The government and Korean companies have taken the first steps to capture new business opportunities in Iran, which has emerged as the \"promised land\" of possibilities since economic sanctions were lifted.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Monday, Minister Joo Hyung-hwan met with a number of Iranian government officials on Sunday and discussed ways to strengthen economic cooperation for the first time in 10 years.\n\nJoo met Iranian Finance Minister Ali Tayebnia, Iran Central Bank Gov. Valiollah Seif, Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi and other prominent decision-makers in Tehran.\n\n\"I hope to strengthen the partnership in infrastructure and social overhead capital,\" Joo said. \"We hope Korea will become Iran's precious business partner.\"\n\nHe said he will try to improve ties between the two countries to form long-term relationships instead of just focusing on short-term goals.\n\nSpecifically, Joo and Iranian ministers discussed financial and economic cooperation and infrastructure projects involving railroads and harbor facilities.\n\nIn his meeting with Seif, Joo asked the Iranian government to slow down its withdrawal of deposits in Korean banks. When some of the sanctions were lifted earlier the year, Iran considered withdrawing money from Korea. The money has been frozen in Korean institutions for the past five years since Iran's assets were frozen as part of imposed sanctions.\n\nJoo and Seif also discussed establishing a credit limit for loans of about $200 million. The two countries signed a basic agreement to create 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) worth of trade insurance for projects designated by the Iranian government. These funds will be financed by the Export-Import Bank of Korea and other financial institutions, the Korean Trade Ministry said.\n\nJoo also asked for Iranian government support on road and railway construction projects worth $4.9 billion, which would allow Korean companies to get involved in the future.\n\nJoo said the Export-Import Bank of Korea will resume providing an Economic Development Cooperation Fund to Iran this year.\n\n\"Korea and Iran should not only focus on short-run outcomes like temporary increases in trade volume,\" said Joo, who attended the Korea-Iran Forum banquet with entrepreneurs and government officials from both countries. \"Instead, we really want to build a genuine, long-term partnership toward shared prosperity through comprehensive cooperation in social, cultural and economic domains.\n\n\"Taking advantage of Korea's strong manufacturing base, cutting-edge information and communications technology, and well-educated human resources, Korea will help Iran build more sophisticated industrial bases.\"\n\nAlong with government officials, a number of Korean businesses expressed plans to reach their goals in the Middle East.\n\nPosco, Korea's largest steelmaker, looks close to making headway in Iran since the country has plans to increase its crude steel production from 16.11 million tons to 55 million tons in the future.\n\nLee Hoo-geun, an executive of Posco, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran's steel company, Pars Kohan Diar Parsian Steel (PKP), to jointly build an integrated steel mill with a total production capacity of 1.6 million tons per year.\n\nPosco Energy also signed a memorandum of understanding with PKP to build a gas power plant in cooperation with the Korea Electric Power Corporation, while Posco E&C also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Iranian company to carry out a water conversion business.\n\nSK Group sent two high-ranking executives to Iran. SK Networks President & CEO Moon Jong-hoon and SK Energy CEO Kim Joon met with Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran's petroleum minister, last week.\n\nSince Feb. 23, Moon has been touring Europe, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to find new business partners. Kim is considering establishing a branch of SK Energy in Iran.\n\n\"This is an opportunity that can create synergy between Iran and SK Group,\" Moon said. \"We strongly believe that the partnership with Iranian companies can get much stronger at this time, as the two sides have 30 years of history.\"\n\nSamsung, the nation's No. 1 conglomerate, is also looking for an opportunity in Iran. The company sent Park Sang-jin, president of Samsung Electronics, and Park Joo-won, president of Samsung Engineering. Samsung C&T sent executive Lee Beom-soon, while Samsung Heavy Industries sent executive Chung Joong-hyun.\n\nLee met with Iranian businesses to launch a project involving the construction of harbors, roads, bridges, hospitals and infrastructure necessary to build up an electronic information system. Chung met with executives from Iran's state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines to discuss the sale of vessels.\n\nOther Korean businesses, such as Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hyundai Oilbank, are also trying to strengthen their access to Iran to import more Iranian crude oil and win more contracts to sell ships.\n\nDoosan Heavy Industries recently held a showcase in Iran to target the water conversion market with its affiliates overseas, including Doosan Skoda Power.\n\n\"Iran is a huge market that will help us break through the slumping economy and low international oil prices,\" said Kim Heon-tak, a vice president of Doosan Heavy Industries. \"We will try to find an opportunity in the water conversion business with our industry-leading technology.\"\n\nBY KWON SANG-SOO, KIM YOUNG-NAM [kwon.sangsoo@joongang.co.kr]", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists.

Some of the posts were savvy, and others were subpar, but all of them illustrated lessons that businesses should keep in mind. Here are some of the lessons we picked up.\n\nBreakfast: Best supporting role every single day. #redcarpetseason pic.twitter.com/F8AR3ql1Zw -- Special K (@SpecialKUS)\n\nFebruary 28, 2016\n\nWhile the intention makes sense -- Special K connected its brand to the Oscars in a way that refreshingly avoided talking about slimming down for dresses -- this still misses the mark. Though the intention of the ad is to suggest that breakfast is there to support you, the customer, the message is a bit muddled.\n\nOne could, for example, think that the company is suggesting that breakfast, which its product is most associated with, is secondary to having a good morning rather than the lead. What happened to breakfast being the most important meal of the day?\n\nThere should be no confusion about the message of your company. Make it clear enough for everyone to easily understand.\n\nThis sums up the sweetest moments from the #Oscars. Everyone loves #GirlScoutCookies pic.twitter.com/sSfnN7pL5h -- Girl Scouts (@girlscouts)\n\nFebruary 29, 2016\n\nChris Rock won the World's Greatest Dad award last night when he sold Girl Scout cookies on live television to help his daughters beat their troup nemesis for the top seller's spot. The social-media squad at Girl Scouts HQ should have been publicizing that immediately. Instead, the company waited more than 20 minutes before it mentioned the moment on its Twitter feed. If it's not possible to grab an image immediately, at least reference the moment in text.\n\nGolden opportunities don't come around often, so take advantage when you get one.\n\nActions speak louder than words, they say. So when you want customers to know that your product solves a problem or what features and capabilities it has, show them. Demonstrate, as IBM did in its \"robot support group\" commercial, the qualities you want your brand to be known for, whether that's superior technology or a commitment to innovation.\n\n#ChristianBale and #SibiBale wearing #DolceGabbana to the 88th Annual Academy Awards. #oscars #oscars2016 pic.twitter.com/byUiPNXSSm -- Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana)\n\nFebruary 29, 2016\n\nThe Oscars are dedicated to celebrating film, yes, but the show is also a major night for fashion. Knowing this, fashion powerhouse Dolce & Gabbana put pictures of stars wearing its label on its Twitter feed. The best advertisement for a fashion brand is a picture of an A-lister in its designs, which D&G knew how to pull off.\n\nVersace, on the other hand, didn't show photos on their feed until early this morning. The night of the show, the brand merely tweeted text about which star was wearing looks from which collection with the hashtag #VersaceCelebreties.\n\nRelated: The Key to Startup Visibility: Let Customers Do the Work for You\n\nRemember the star-studded selfie that Ellen DeGeneres took with the Galaxy Note 3 during the 2014 Oscars?

Apple is no longer the underdog, and the Android platform is able to portray itself as the new counter-culture company.

In doing so, it portrayed a timeless message: Dunkin Donuts coffee, much like the Oscar statue, is what everyone wants -- it's the best there is.

Let's line up their features and specs to help you decide between the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\n\nThis won't be your deciding factor, as both headsets give you the same 1080p per-eye resolution.\n\nYears down the road, more advanced VR should have photorealistic visuals, making these two look fuzzy by comparison. But by today's standards, we've been plenty impressed with the fidelity of both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\n\nWe don't know the exact field of view of the Oculus Rift, but Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe told us last June that \"it's no less than anything you've seen before.\" Most people interpret that as meaning about 110 degrees diagonally, which was the FOV of the first Rift development kit (DK1).\n\nBoth headsets support a smooth 90 frames per second, which boosts the sense of \"presence\" (feeling that you're somewhere else) compared to lower frame rates.\n\nThis is another spec that will likely go much higher in future generations, for VR that makes reality and virtual reality nearly indistinguishable.\n\nRight now this is the de facto standard in quality VR: you need a low-persistence OLED display. Or, in both of these cases, two OLED panels - one per eye.\n\nNeither manufacturer has listed the dimensions of their headsets, but the somewhat bulbous Vive is definitely the bigger of the two.\n\nDitto for weight: no official specs, but we know from experience that the Rift feels lighter. It's not that the Vive's weight, though, is even close to anything to worry about.\n\nThe Rift has a sleeker build, with fabric covering parts of the headset, while the Vive appears to be all plastic.\n\nUnlike most flagships smartphones, there aren't any alternative color options for either headset. That may have to wait for another generation or two down the road, when OEMs start trying harder to differentiate and personalize their VR gear.\n\nThe Rift has built-in headphones, while the Vive only includes a pair of earbuds. The buds will do a solid enough job, but for the best VR experience, Vive owners will want to plug in a quality pair of cans.\n\nWe've been happy with the Oculus Rift's audio experience in our demos, but you'll also have the option of swapping out its headphones for your own pair, if you prefer.\n\nThe two headsets let you wear glasses underneath.\n\nUnlike the mobile Samsung Gear VR, neither of the PC-based headsets lets you tweak the focus. If you wear corrective lenses, either glasses or contacts, then you'll need to put those on underneath.\n\nBoth the Vive and Rift let you adjust the lenses' horizontal distance, to find the best fit for your unique facial structure.\n\nThe Vive also lets you slide its lenses forwards and backwards, to either give you more space for glasses (farther) or optimize your field of view (closer) if you don't wear glasses.\n\nOnly mobile VR is completely wireless; it's going to be a while until we see PC-based VR where you don't have a long cord/tail hanging down from the back of your head.\n\nThis is the Vive's killer feature. The Rift will eventually support room-scale VR too, by plugging in a second (or third?) positional sensor, but it isn't yet tailored for larger-scale, free-roaming experiences the way the Vive is. In fact, until its Oculus Touch controllers launch later this year, room-scale won't be an option for the Rift.\n\nYou can walk around a roughly 15 x 15 ft (nearly 3 x 3 m) space as soon as the Vive launches.\n\nThough the Rift's lineup of launch games is much more focused on this, the Vive will also support seated VR experiences. In both cases, the positional sensors will detect leaning and other upper body movement, even when seated.\n\nThey also use different approaches to body tracking. The Vive's \"Lighthouse\" base stations emit lasers that photosensors on the headset and motion controllers track to determine their own positions in space. The Rift's approach is nearly the opposite, using an optical sensor (eventually two) connected to the PC to detect the headset's and controllers' positions in space.\n\nIt's possible that optical sensors will be the longer-term destination, as we move into VR where you can see virtual versions of your own hands and fingernails inside virtual worlds. But right now the Vive's solution is more ideal for room-scale: you could argue that it will have less room for tracking errors, but either way Lighthouse has the simplicity advantage of simply plugging into wall outlets.\n\nAbout the only drawback to the Vive's tracking system is that you'll need to mount the two base stations on your wall, in opposite corners. Failing that, you could put them on sturdy tripods. The Rift's trackers will just sit on your desk or somewhere else in your room (though Oculus says you'll be able to mount them as well).\n\nThe two platforms' motion controllers - Vive controllers and Oculus Touch - are very similar, giving you the feeling of having hands inside virtual worlds. The Vive's controllers, though, are bundled with the headset from Day One. Oculus Touch doesn't launch until the second half of 2016.\n\nWhile the Vive will support any PC-based gamepad, it doesn't ship with one. This category emphasizes the Rift's early focus on seated experiences, as it has a wireless Xbox One controller in the box.\n\nTo go along with its room-scale focus, the Vive has a forward-facing camera. Working with its Chaperone software system, the camera can pop up obstacles in your environment, to keep you from stepping on poor Rover's tail while roaming around, blasting away at bad guys.\n\nPerhaps this could also allow the Vive to eventually incorporate AR elements, integrating real-world visuals into virtual worlds. Even if it does, though, it's probably going to be another generation or two before that kind of thing looks really good in VR.\n\nYour PC's minimum GPU requirements are the same for both headsets. While these are high-end cards, they're still (fortunately) far from the most expensive, running a bit over US$300 either way.\n\nOf course you can also opt for a better card for an even higher-fidelity experience, but in this case \"minimum\" should still make for a high-quality, uncompromised VR experience.\n\nThese are similar as well, though Oculus seems to be a bit stingier (or just less clear) when it comes to AMD chips. If you have one of those inside your gaming PC, you'll want to run Oculus' system checker tool (you can find the link here) to see it's kosher.\n\nHTC says you'll be able to get by with 4 GB of RAM for the Vive, while Oculus is recommending double that. If you're building your PC from scratch for the Vive, we say pay the (relatively minor) difference in price and go with at least 8 GB to be safe.\n\nThe Rift requires a whopping four USB ports, compared to just one for the Vive. Again, that's because the Rift's optical sensors plug directly into the PC, while the Vive's base stations just need power outlets.\n\nA few things, though, to keep in mind. Oculus is including a second positional sensor in this requirement, for when Oculus Touch launches later this year. Until that time, the Rift will only need three USB ports (two 3.0 and one 2.0 or higher).\n\nAlso HTC isn't including a port for a gamepad in its listing, so if you want to hook one up for seated Vive experiences, then you can add a USB 2.0 or higher to its side of the column.\n\nIf you're short on ports for the Rift, you can either install a PCI Express expansion card, or (simpler and cheaper) just plug in a powered USB splitter accessory.\n\nYou'll also need video output on your PC for either headset. HTC gives you the option of using HDMI or DisplayPort, while the Rift is HDMI only.\n\nWe haven't demoed it yet, but HTC threw in a last-minute Vive feature that syncs your smartphone (via Bluetooth) to let you answer calls and reply to messages while in VR. Now there's no reason to ever come out!\n\nBoth headsets require a PC running Windows 7 SP1 or newer. They then veer off from there, filtering through each platform's storefront: SteamVR for the Vive, and Oculus Home for the Rift. Many developers will be making their games universally-compatible for both systems, but there are also quite a few Oculus exclusives locked into its platform.\n\nWe'll get a closer look at each platform's launch titles at GDC, but so far we'd give the edge to the Rift. We've simply played more Rift games - and many of them look amazing. With that said, Valve recently announced a few standout titles for the Vive, including post-apocalyptic, moving platform shooter Hover Junkers and the Portal-like Budget Cuts.\n\nThe HTC Vive includes two games in the box: the hilarious Job Simulator and building game Fantastic Contraption. The Rift includes two games as well: delightful platformer Lucky's Tale and space shooter Eve: Valkyrie.\n\nThe only difference is that HTC is saying its games are only bundled for a limited time. It sounds like the Rift bundle is permanent.\n\nKicking it old-school, like 80s and 90s era Mac and Windows showdowns, each platform has a paint app. Google's Tilt Brush for the Vive (which is also bundled with the headset for a limited time) and Oculus Medium for the Rift, which will come at some point after Oculus Touch launches.\n\nPainting or sculpting in a virtual space, where you can draw, resize, mold and walk around all directions, is quite the trippy experience.\n\nYou can pre-order both headsets today, with the first Rift shipments heading out in late March. Vive shipments start soon after, in early April.\n\nThe only catch is that, since Rift orders have already been open for close to two months, current orders have an expected July ship date. If you want a Rift before then and haven't pre-ordered, you'll have to hope to snag one in retail outlets or hit up places like eBay.\n\nThe Vive costs an extra $200, but remember that its motion controllers are included in the box. We don't yet know how much Oculus Touch will eventually add to the total cost of a complete Rift experience. On the other hand, the Vive doesn't include full headphones or a gamepad in its box.\n\nThis looks like a tricky call for VR early adopters - both headsets have blown our minds on multiple occasions. We'll get to play with them both in a couple of weeks at GDC, though, so stay tuned to Gizmag.", "That's the promise of modular design, a new concept in smartphones that would basically let you snap together different components like Lego blocks. Say you want a great camera. Snap! A vivid screen and good sound because you watch a lot of video? Snap! But maybe you could live with a smaller battery because you spend most of your day at home or work. Snap!\n\nSure, phones now offer choices in color and storage. Motorola goes a bit further in letting you choose custom backs made of wood or leather. But the rest of the phone is pretty standard. You're stuck with the processor, battery and other hardware chosen by Motorola, Apple, Samsung and other tech companies.\n\nWith modular design, you could just pay for the components you need instead of settling for whatever manufacturers put in their designs. And instead of buying a new phone every year or two, you could just upgrade individual parts as they wear out or become obsolete.\n\nLG is dipping its toes in the modular-design concept with its upcoming G5 smartphone, announced this week at a wireless conference. The bottom of the phone pops out to let you swap in new hardware. For starters, you'll be able to attach a camera grip with physical shutter buttons or insert a high-fidelity audio system if regular MP3-quality sound isn't good enough for you.\n\nGoogle's Project Ara, which isn't making products yet, is also outlining a modular-design approach that starts with a structural frame and lets you add cameras, sensors and batteries. Google figures a phone could cost as little as $50 using the most basic parts.\n\nA Dutch startup called Fairphone is selling the $580 Fairphone 2 online. Though it comes assembled, you can replace the screen for less than $100, or the camera for $40. An expansion port will let people add components -- perhaps for wireless charging or mobile payments -- that Fairphone or outside parties make in the future.\n\nChinese phone maker ZTE has circulated concept designs. Other startups exploring modular phones include Finland's PuzzlePhone (as in the components fit together like a puzzle).\n\nModular phone design is similar to how hobbyists build their own personal computers or soup up their cars. But there's no guarantee the idea will take off.\n\nFor one thing, modular design is itself a trade-off. Many consumers want phones to be thin, light and power efficient, and that means all the parts have to be tightly integrated. You give that up when you go modular.\n\nSamsung, for instance, rejects modular design, preferring to offer \"the best combination of features and functionality\" in a compact and elegant design, says Justin Denison, Samsung's senior vice president for U.S. product strategy and marketing.\n\nModular design also isn't easy. Project Ara missed its 2015 target for a pilot project in Puerto Rico and suggested in cryptic tweets that designing modules has proven more complicated than expected. Google had no further comment.\n\nRonan de Renesse, lead analyst for consumer technology with the research firm Ovum, says many parts in current smartphones are designed specifically to work together. Swap in a new camera or screen, and the older processors might not know what to do with it. The camera might stutter, the screen might blink, and both might drain the battery faster than expected.\n\nLego-like parts also could allow dust or water to intrude into the phone's innards. Their connections might also give way over time.\n\n\"I don't think those phones are going to be reliable enough for the mass market,\" de Renesse says.\n\nThere's already some buzz around the phones. Fairphone has sold about 35,000 units and is targeting 150,000 this year. The company says many of its customers are environmentally conscious about e-waste and don't need up-to-the-minute advances in phone technology.\n\nMany big phone makers introduce features just to have something to brag about in ads, says Miquel Ballester, Fairphone's co-founder. \"I don't really think it's always what the customer is looking for.\"\n\nEven if the appeal is limited, the concept could have broader influence.\n\nLG's G5 isn't fully modular, as users couldn't replace processors, cameras and screens themselves. LG's Frank Lee says the modular design for now is mostly about enhancing the phone's capabilities with optional features. But perhaps one day, he says, people will be able to swap in a slower, but more power-efficient processor on days they'll be away from chargers.\n\nIn the future, he says, \"we won't be referring to them as phones anymore.\"", "Jay Z's Music Service, Tidal, Arrives With A Splash, And Questions Follow\n\nThe technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists. Two albums that are very popular right now were released on Tidal, a streaming service owned by a group of artists headed by Jay-Z. One of those albums is near the top of the charts right now. The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center. The album that has a lot of critics and fans wrapped up right now is West's The Life of Pablo. To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones. Exclusive streaming deals have their own ramifications.\n\nTake for example Drake's inescapable \"Hotline Bling.\" Last fall, when the video for \"Hotline Bling\" was released, Drake was saying how much he was thirsting for a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He wrote about his desire very publicly.\n\nDrake's team gave the video to Apple Music as an exclusive -- and the strategy backfired, at least in terms of getting him to his goal of being No. 1. Apple doesn't report its video streams to Nielsen Music, so there was no chance of the song making the top spot as long as it was an Apple exclusive.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Samsung has been in talks from time to time about buying Tidal -- and sources were telling The New York Post this weekend that those talks have resumed in earnest.", "When it comes to my electronic devices, I like them to match the color of my soul: black. With black, you don't have to worry about blue jean stains, it hides all around dirt better, and after years of abuse, it just generally looks better than most other colors. This is purely subjective, I know, but it's the first color I look for when purchasing a new smartphone.\n\nFor years, just about every smartphone has come in a standard issue black model. It's expected. The original Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S2 both featured glossy plastic versions as their mainstay. But in 2012, things took a dark turn (not the color, mind you) when Samsung introduced the Samsung Galaxy S3. That year, Samsung was looking to revitalize the brand and part of that vision included a new version of TouchWiz along with an entirely new design, metallic new colors, and a complete absence of the standard \"piano black\" model. Instead, we saw Samsung introduce a new \"Pebble Blue\" color with \"hyper glaze finish.\" I don't care what they called it -- it wasn't black and I was pissed. Samsung would later introduce a \"Sapphire Black\" model on Verizon but by then it was too late. I had already sealed my fate with the white model (besides, I was with T-Mobile).\n\nThe following year, the Samsung Galaxy S4 only continued with Samsung's blue trend and even though 2014's Samsung Galaxy S5 got close, the grey-ish (almost purple) back only further fueled my fears that Samsung would never again build another all-black Galaxy S. By the time the \"black Sapphire\" Samsung Galaxy S6 launched -- make no qualms about it, it was most certainly blue -- I had pretty much given up hope that Samsung even knew what real black was anymore.\n\nFast forward to just last week when Samsung unveiled the all new Galaxy S7 and lo and behold what did I see? Was it really a black Galaxy S7? Surely my eyes deceived me. I carefully and thoroughly examined the phone during our extensive hands-on time with it was able to confirm that, without a shadow of a doubt, this was, in fact, a black Galaxy S. Samsung calls it \"Black Onyx\" and although there's a tinge of purple in the metal surrounding the phone (see below pic), the back and front bezels are 100% black. Sure, there's a metallic sheen to it, but by now, that's to be expected from Samsung's design department.\n\nWith Samsung finally nailing down black on the Galaxy S7, I can confidently and enthusiastically say that after all these years, I can finally own a black Galaxy device and it just feels so right. The question is, will you be picking up the new Black Onyx model, or opting for one of the other colors made available across various carriers here in the US? Let us know your thoughts and cast your vote in our poll down below.", "Mighty is the iPod shuffle for the cord-cutting Spotify age.\n\nMore and more people are opting to stream their music instead of download it. While this has its conveniences, it poses some problems too -- especially when it comes to being active in the great outdoors. Most of us rely on smartphones to stream, but they're fragile, expensive and getting larger and larger with each release. They're definitely not ideal for running, snowboarding, rock climbing or the like. Smartwatches and the iPod shuffle solve that problem, but you can't stream on them.\n\nTo solve this dilemma, a team of engineers and businessmen who previously worked for companies including Microsoft, Samsung, Qualcomm and Live Nation built what can only be described as a perfectly portable Spotify machine. It's called Mighty and allows Spotify premium users to stream their playlists while leaving their phone at home. The team is currently raising $250,000 on Kickstarter to make it happen. They're a few days into the campaign and have raised $172,000 thus far.\n\n\"When Spotify came to the U.S. in 2011 and I switched from iTunes (and a shuffle), my first question was 'where's the shuffle for this?' I'm an ex-collegiate athlete and stay pretty active and assumed somebody would built the product, but here we are five years later and we're the first ones to try and make it happen,\" Anthony Pu, head of operations, told the Observer. He had the ah-ha moment once when he dropped his phone, and it turns out one of the reasons this team is so dedicated is because each member has cracked his phone screen while exercising as well.\n\nMighty is sweat and drop resistant.\n\nMighty is lightweight, durable and clips on to any piece of clothing. Loading it up with music is simple -- no cords or computers required. Just open the app, pair the device to your phone and sync your playlists using bluetooth or WiFi. It will store 48 hours worth of music and feature \"at least five hours of continuous music playback\" on a single charge, but the team's goal is 10 hours.\n\nSpotify is not officially partnered with Mighty and its makers, but it will still integrate with the platform with ease. It is, however, only compatible with Spotify premium accounts.\n\n\"We do not need anything on the licensing or technical side,\" Mr. Pu said. \"For the time being, Mighty functions just like any other offline device that has the ability to store music. Your smartphone, for example, is defined by Spotify as an offline device.\"\n\nMighty has 23 more days to reach its funding goal.\n\n\"We are humbly excited, but also remaining paranoid and hungry,\" Mr. Pu said. \"The support and backing from the global community has been amazing validation of the product and we want to keep pushing and shoot way past our original goal.\"", "Storage in smartphones has come a long way in a short amount of time since its inception. My first Android device, the Samsung Vibrant for T-Mobile, featured 16GB of internal storage with microSD card support. At the time the amount of internal storage was astonishing, especially considering some flagship devices still used less than 1GB of internal memory - a common occurrence at the time, and a huge step up from any of the BlackBerry or Windows Mobile devices I had used prior. And for the same (subsidized) price you could buy the Samsung Vibrant for, you would only get 8GB of memory with the iPhone 4, which was released that same year. This was back in 2010.\n\nIt has been almost 6 years since the release of the Vibrant, and it still isn't uncommon to see 16GB of internal storage used as the base amount in some flagships. Some companies (I'm looking at you, Apple) still find this to be an acceptable amount. But as technology and development in smartphones keep expanding it's clear that 16GB just isn't cutting it for most people long-term anymore. Despite the high-quality cameras, expansive app selection, and plethora of music applications that allow for the use of \"Offline Listening\" by downloading playlists to your phone's memory, 16GB is still expected to handle that in some situations.\n\nEven when microSD card support is added in, it feels like 16GB of storage is ancient. After all, smartphones exist with up to 128GB of internal storage at this point. Why is the new norm not 32GB across the board yet? And with news surfacing that Samsung has created a 256GB UFS (Universal Flash Storage) 2.0 chip for smartphones, will we finally see the disappearance of 16GB of memory in flagships in the near future?\n\nI certainly hope so.\n\nDespite the remedies (such as cloud storage) and excuses made for phones that feature such a small amount of storage, I can't help but feel that having storage on the device itself is better. While I've resorted to using the cloud and have tried to convince myself that it is a fine alternative, it still grinds my gears knowing that I'm entrusting my documents and information to somebody else. Even if those documents don't hold anything truly important, it's just the principle of the thing. It doesn't feel right to me.\n\nI'm sure that this anger towards 16GB internal storage spawns from my iPhone 6, but I know other high-end phones have the same problem. When I got the dreaded \"Low Storage\" notification again today, I realized that I don't think I can handle 16GB internal storage anymore. My next daily driver is going to have to feature more, which is what leaves me conflicted.\n\nWhile I'm a fan of most operating systems for one reason or another, iOS has been working out pretty well for me thus far. But if the iPhone 7 were still to be released with a base 16GB of storage in tow, I don't know if I could support the cause. While $100 more for 64GB of storage is nice, I just don't think it was a good idea to nix the 32GB option in favor of 16. And while I'd like to sit here and say I'm certain that Apple will raise the bar to 32GB this year, the past two years where \"I've had a good feeling about it this year, guys!\" have proved me wrong. I have no reason to believe that it will happen this year either. If anything else it will be a pleasant surprise, but I digress.\n\nI have no qualms with 16GB of storage remaining in phones that are priced appropriately for it. There is definitely a place for 16GB of storage in the smartphone industry, but that place is no longer with flagships. Here's to hoping that 2016 is the year that 16GB of storage in flagships is the last year it will happen.", "Many in the U.S. are unfamiliar with Nexus 6P manufacturer Huawei. Company executive Richard Yu aims to change that. Image Source: Alphabet\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nYou can't blame Huawei's management for feeling confident. In 2015, the company edged out former technology darling Xiaomi to become China's fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer. According to market researcher IDC, Huawei increased its smartphone shipments a massive 44% in 2015 to become the third-largest smartphone vendor with 106 million unit shipments. While trailing No. 1 Samsung (325 million) and No. 2 Apple (231 million) in total shipments, the company's growth far outpaced the 10.1% total market growth.\n\nPerhaps confident is understating Huawei's ambitions. According to Richard Yu, Huawei's device chief, the company thinks it can be the No. 1 smartphone manufacturer in five years and take the No. 2 spot within two to three years. In what could be considered the understatement of the year in technology (so far), Yu followed his ambitious statement, according to a report in Re/Code, by saying, \"Maybe I am not humble.\" Can Huawei succeed in this formidable goal?\n\nHuawei wants to be No. 2 in 2-3 years\n\nWhile Huawei quickly became the No. 3 smartphone vendor, claiming 7.4 % market share, the road to No. 2 will be much harder. As of last year, Apple claimed that title with 231.5 million unit shipments. Huawei would have to increase shipments 47% annually over the next two years or 29% annually over the next three years to eclipse Apple's current total. Note this is calculation is contingent on Apple not increasing its iPhone shipments at all during this time frame, a highly improbable scenario considering Apple increased shipments 20.2% last year.\n\nIt would help to increase shipments in the United States. Although the country has recently been surpassed by India as the world's second-largest smartphone market, the United States' position as the largest developed market should help Huawei increase shipments of high-end, profitable smartphones. Additionally, a highly successful U.S. launch has spillover benefits of elevating the company's brand profile in developing countries, much like how Apple is considered a luxury brand in China.\n\nLast year, Huawei won the coveted manufacturing contract for Alphabet's current-gen Google Nexus 6P, but even Yu admitted the company is \"quite late\" in its U.S. smartphone strategy. While contribution from the United States is helpful, perhaps the best path for Huawei is to continue to focus on the developing markets.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSamsung may be an easier target... especially in developing markets\n\nIronically, Huawei's best strategy for achieving No. 2 status (and eventually No. 1) is to set its sights upon the current No. 1 vendor: Samsung. Samsung typically utilizes a bifurcated smartphone strategy by pushing the Galaxy smartphone line in developed markets and a host of low/mid-range form factors in developing smartphone markets. While this catapulted Samsung to the No. 1 smartphone manufacturer with IDC estimating 325 million shipments in 2015, Samsung's anemic growth rate of 2.1% points to trouble ahead for the South Korean electronics conglomerate.\n\nIn developing, price-sensitive markets like India and China, Huawei has a better chance of growing shipments. IDC credits Huawei's \"affordable handsets in emerging markets,\" for the increased market share. In China, Huawei has a home-grown advantage in a country where many executives think the government tends to unfairly promote domestic competitors. The next battleground for these two will most likely be India. India's projected GDP growth rate of 7.8%, low current online-penetration rate, and fast-growing mobile Internet user projections make it an attractive market for low/mid-range smartphone models.\n\nOn a user-shipment basis it's possible for Huawei to continue its torrid growth. But I think the vast majority of future growth is going to come from the razor-thin margin low end while Apple and Samsung are more worried about high-end growth.\n\nThe article Will China's Fastest-Growing Smartphone Company Beat Apple and Samsung? originally appeared on Fool.com.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Gou made the bet and has gone forward aggressively over the past four years in order to realize his vision of bolstering Hon Hai's LCD panel capability. For Sharp, the ailing 100-year-old company, the contradictions that Hon Hai has been forced to offer continued on Sunday with its denial of media reports that a final deal would be signed on March 7. No date has been agreed on, Hon Hai said. Gou and his board are right to be prudent, as no company can afford to toy around with US$3 billion out of the blue on its accounting sheet. Any relevant decisions would be adversely impacted, as it makes no sense to sink a company with a new treasure chest. The murky nature of contingent liabilities defies solid accounting.\n\nBut Terry Gou's persistence in bringing the deal to its current form is an example of laudable strategic thinking. Most importantly, he has laid out a blueprint for developing a brand by going beyond contracting for Apple. Nikkei, in its article titled \"Hon Hai's Target is Sharp's Technical Prowess,\" identified vertical integration as the path that Hon Hai is pushing forward. To further that end, Sharp's holdings in the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Organic Electroluminesence Display (OLED) panel technologies sector are a significant boost to Hon Hai's ambitions to challenge its major rivals, notably Samsung. Nikkei comments that although the Taiwanese manufacturer has Innolux, a subsidiary that specializes in liquid panels, its technologies are still not up to the competition.\n\nThe union between Sharp's high-technology patents and Hon Hai's established leadership in low-cost manufacturing is imagined to be the winning formula for boosting market share in electronic panels, Nikkei commented. All of this, of course, is with an eye toward major international competitors like Samsung.\n\nAs of now, Hon Hai's accounting and legal team is on the ground in Japan to investigate the matter of the liabilities, which the Taiwan company claims was revealed on Feb. 24, a day before the Sharp board's issuance of its acceptance report. There are also dramatic reports of Gou being livid at feeling played, and Sharp's CEO Takahashi flying to Shenzhen for emergency meetings with Gou."]}, "BASF": {"2016-02-26": ["Some local students put on their safety glasses Friday - all in the name of science.\n\nThey're celebrating National Engineering Week at Thunderbolt Elementary.

You have to look at multiples, price expectations in the market, and have to make up your mind whether that is something which is really creating value or not.\"\n\nBASF was left on the sidelines after its two biggest rivals in the U.S. announced a $130 billion merger and ChemChina agreed to buy Switzerland's Syngenta for about $43 billion. Monsanto Co.'s unsuccessful approach for Syngenta sent ripples through the industry as the other top suppliers of herbicides, genetically modified seeds and other products raced to calculate the implications of such a tie-up.\n\nBefore Syngenta's tie up with ChemChina, BASF discussed various options including a full and partial acquisition of its Swiss peer, according to people familiar with the matter. Under one plan, the German company would have contributed its agricultural business plus some cash to Syngenta in return for a majority stake in the enlarged company, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans weren't public.\n\nThe German company would've likely sought an exemption from Swiss regulators from making a mandatory takeover offer to Syngenta shareholders, one of the people said.\n\nBASF had also secured financing to make a counteroffer for all of Syngenta as other rivals pursued a takeover, the people said. Monsanto withdrew its bid in August after being rebuffed by Syngenta's management. BASF and Monsanto also discussed joining forces to take over Syngenta, the people said. In the end, Syngenta opted for the all-cash offer from the Chinese.\n\nA BASF representative declined to comment.\n\nChanging Industry\n\n\"We have a clear strategy to grow the company; this includes M&A and portfolio management,\" Bock said in the television interview. \"Yes, our industry is changing. Whether it is strengthening the industry or whether it is just rearranging the chairs around the table needs to be seen. In ag, obviously there has been some consolidation, but from my point of view, the acquisition, nationalization of Syngenta is not changing industry structure.\"\n\nBASF said Thursday it will halve the research workforce at its plant biotechnology operation as it narrows its focus on projects with the most profit potential. The cutbacks will lead to 320 jobs lost in in North America and Europe.\n\n\"We made a clear decision about 10 to 15 years ago not to enter the seed business,\" Bock said. \"We have a strong and good collaboration with Monsanto which is working out quite nicely and we feel very comfortable with the business that we have.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "The major U.S. index futures point to a higher opening on Friday, as risk appetite improves amid easing growth fears.

Dapper, diminutive and wearing a light checked jacket with purple Paisley tie and a handkerchief in his top pocket, Steve Sanderson isn't your typical oil explorer.\n\nUntil you realise this is the man who truly believes there are billions of barrels of oil beneath the South of England and who sparked the stock-market excitement over the Gatwick Gusher last year.\n\nUntil you hear that he left school to study glaciers in the Arctic.\n\nUntil he tells you about his five years in the Parachute Regiment when -- equipped with only a handgun while the surrounding Soviet army had heavily armed vehicles and automatic weaponry, and seriously outnumbered the British soldiers guarding a radar post on the West German border -- he found himself with a likely life expectancy of 25 minutes.\n\nYet he freely admits: \"I was the boy on the school trip who wandered along the seashore and my friend behind me would be picking up fossils and I would wonder 'where did he get that from?' \" Sanderson's geological knowledge is much sharper these days. He bats for his company, UK Oil and Gas (Ukog), and the need to exploit onshore oil, right up to the most famous front door in the land.\n\n\"No.10 is fundamental to the equation,\" he says. \"In Texas, the Eagle Ford Field, it takes 21 days to get a permit to drill. Here in the Weald, it takes two to two-and-a-half years. In Texas, one body approves it. Here, it is four -- planning permission, Environment Agency, HSE, the UK Oil and Gas Authority -- one after each other. That's four different bureaucracies with few people in them who know about the oil industry. If that is allowed to continue, nothing will get off the ground.\"\n\nIt may seem strange that a man at the centre of a maelstrom last April -- when the BBC said that, based on Ukog's first test drill results, there were up to 100 billion barrels of oil beneath the South of England -- still has the ear of Government. Shares shot up 70% that day but have since fallen from 4.75p to 2.85p.\n\nSanderson has become used to playing the straight man to former chairman David Lenigas and his euphoria. When UKOG revealed the results of its first flow test just over a week ago, Sanderson told me the results were \"stellar\" but argued the geology of the case in detail.\n\nLenigas, the loudmouthed Australian who set up UKOG and most of the AIM oil companies that are also invested in the Horse Hill venture near Gatwick Airport, said: \"February 2016 will be remembered for many reasons. Not because David Lenigas was vindicated. This is more important than that. It will be remembered as the dawn of a new energy era of prosperity for the UK.\" More recently, he has described Sanderson as a \"hero\", \"incredible oil man\" and \"gentleman\".\n\nSanderson doesn't quite return the compliment. \"Sometimes I wish Dave would shut up, particularly recently,\" he quips. \"I first met him via a friend in the oil consultancy industry in July 2014. He wasn't quite as he was portrayed -- as the brash oil investor. In fact, I liked him from the word go.\n\n\"He's a very intense person and really thinks outside the box. Although we are very different characters, we are complementary.\" Sanderson also makes it clear that without Lenigas's enthusiasm and fundraising skills, Horse Hill would probably not have got off (or under) the ground.\n\nUKOG owns 30% of the project, and a handful of other AIM companies also previously linked to Lenigas have smaller stakes. Sanderson, 59, graduated from the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College and ended up working in Big Oil after the family-inspired stint in the Army. Well almost. His first major management role was with Atlantic Richfield, the US oil group that was pulled together by wildcatter the late Robert Orville Anderson, was taken over by BP in 2000 and became less exciting. Next followed Wintershall, Germany's biggest oil company and an offshoot of chemicals giant BASF.\n\nThen came a peripatetic career starting up or running oil companies from Norway to Libya and from the South Atlantic to the Weald. Sanderson has clearly enjoyed doing his own thing and making money for himself, and his record for finding oil is pretty spectacular.\n\n\"I've drilled around 50 wells, of which 23 have been oil discoveries, and of those 14 have been commercial,\" he says with a glint behind his yellow-framed spectacles. \"That's not a bad rate. Exploration is all about risk. You have to look at the range of possible outcomes from the best to the worst and work out where the likely result lies. Of course, you need to start with good geology but you also have to be lucky.\"\n\nSanderson becomes most animated when he is talking geology. One hand surges forward and upward, depicting an aquifer pushing water into an oilfield to make the black stuff flow to the surface. The other comes to a point as his index finger shows a tiny drillhead driving hundreds of metres horizontally through the limestone to release even greater volumes of oil.\n\nThat's why Horse Hill has really got him excited. \"When we got the first results from the test well, it looked as though either the data was wrong or the model being used by researchers was wrong,\" he admits. His tests were telling him what the Government-backed British Geological Survey's analysis of the Weald Basin appeared to have pooh-poohed. There was actually recoverable oil in significant quantities in the Kimmeridge clays beneath Gatwick and beyond.\n\nThen last week came the first actual flow results from the test well, with oil reaching the surface under its own pressure and flowing at a rate of just over 450 barrels a day.\n\n\"That was so far beyond the range of outcomes we had expected,\" Sanderson says. \"It means we are looking at truly commercial oil production.\"\n\nLiving less than 40 miles from Gatwick, in Haslemere on the edge of the South Downs, Sanderson is insistent that commercial production can get up and running without any serious impact on the environment. Indeed, he tried to convince Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, of this when she visited the dozen demonstrators outside the Horse Hill site two weeks ago.\n\n\"Everything is underground,\" he says. \"The wellheads, the pumps, the manifolds. The only thing above ground will be storage tanks, and they can be camouflaged. At peak production, we will only need one tanker every two hours to take the oil away.\"\n\nOn the big question, Sanderson is adamant. \"There will be no fracking,\" he insists. \"We don't need to frack and, in any case it is illegal to do so in this country above a depth of 1000 metres and we have only drilled to 900 metres.\"\n\nAs the sun dips over St James's and Sanderson switches from his pot of tea to a generous glass of red wine, he admits he is a Manchester United fan, and so just waiting for the inevitable change of manager at this season's end. In earlier life, he raced Formula Fords and Lola 2000s. Married with two grown-up children, he enjoys watching cricket and likes gardens. His favourite hideaway is a hotel in sumptuous grounds at an oasis a short drive from Marrakesh.\n\nSo what's the endgame with Horse Hill? UKOG, which reported an annual loss of \u00a31.7 million today, doesn't have the cash to put in the dozen or so wells Sanderson would like to ensure commercial production. There are plenty of options such as farming out part of the project to an oil major, raising extra money or even selling out.\n\nBut he hopes it's not the latter: \"I would like to be still here running Horse Hill in 10 years when it is a significant, commercial British oilfield.\"\n\nMore about: Gatwick Oil Oil companies", "German chemical giant BASF SE (BFA.L,BASFY.PK) reported Friday a sharp decline in fiscal 2015 net profit reflecting weak sales performance due to sharply lower oil prices.

Amongst the first companies to come back after the introduction of multi-party democracy and liberalisation of the economy was SeedCo. Later on, Pannar came on the scene and this created real competition as we had three seed companies unlike before when we only had ZamSeed. Later on, one of the renowned seed breeders in Zambia established a seed company called Maize Research Institute (MRI) with some great seed varieties.\n\nWe later saw the coming back of DuPont as Pioneer and now we have Monsanto, who are amongst the giant seed companies in the world.\n\nThe local companies such as Kamano have also been resilient on the seed market and have gone into production especially with their open-pollinated varieties.\n\nWe have EPFC in Chipata, who are also adding value to groundnut seed multiplication. In the last two seasons, we have also seen the coming on the seed market; of Syngenta and Klein Karoo.\n\nIn the crop protection, we mostly had Zambian companies which were trading in generic products from China and India. In the 80s though, we had Shell, which transformed into Cynamid and later CropServe.\n\nAt some point, CropServe was the largest crop protection solution provider and was distributing even for multinational chemical companies such as Bayer, BASF Dow and Makhteshin Agan.\n\nAmongst the Zambian companies was FarmChem, which earlier was distributing for many of the multinationals before CropServe took over the franchise or they shared some product lines.\n\nThe other Zambian companies on the scene then were CropChem, Plant AgriChem, Prime Cropcare and some other small companies operating as sole traders. However, Amiran set up base offering not only the crop protection products but seedlings, communication as well as irrigation equipment.\n\nLater, BASF established a representative office and later became a legal entity in 2015. In November 2013, Syngenta bought off MRI and started distribution it products through MRI as a subsidiary company while Bayer have continued distributing through Precision Farming though they have their own marketing staff on the ground.\n\nThe benefit of having these multinational companies establishing their offices in Zambia is that besides creating job opportunities, we have seen some products becoming cheaper.\n\nThis is good for the farmer because his production costs will ultimately start to go down and their commodities can be competitive.\n\nThere are more companies that are eyeing Zambia as the best investment destination in the region. Not long ago, Yara Fertilisers got a stake in GreenBelt; what this is likely to imply is that they will offer immense competition to other fertiliser companies that have been operating in the country.\n\nThe investment has not just been in the input companies but we have also seen an influx of commodity traders such as Cargill, NWK, CHC, AFGRI and many others.\n\nThis is very good indeed for our agriculture industry; however, the government through its parastatal institutions responsible for policing competition needs to build capacity in them.\n\nWe are likely to see some collusion or dog-to-dog competition, especially before the cake can be grown bigger. This is a reality. For the farmer, this investment by stakeholders is more than welcome and I have never been as excited as I am today because of this massive investment.\n\nAll I can urge these giant companies to invest into growing the cake bigger by investing in opening up of new production opportunities through financing some operations unlike fighting for the ten thousand hectares than the government is subsidising the farmers.\n\nZambia indeed is an investment hub and those companies that are sitting on the perimeter fence still thinking whether to come and invest in this lovely country, need to make the move now!\n\nLastly, my readers who have been pushing me to put all the articles I have been writing since 2012 will be seeing a book late this year of early next year.\n\nI am also inviting those agro-companies which want to be featured in my book to communicate so that I may have a chapter about their companies.\n\nThis author is an Agribusiness Practitioner."], "2016-02-29": ["LONDON, Feb. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Construction chemicals are specialty chemical compounds used to speed up construction activities or improve durability of existing structures.

Incre(EMAILWIRE.COM, February 29, 2016 ) Further, factors driving the growth of the isocyanate market include high demand from current & emerging applications, demand from emerging economies, and advancement in technology. Construction and automotive industry, a major end-user industry of isocyanate, is flourishing which is expected to increase the demand for isocyanate and its derivatives such as adhesives, sealants, rigid foams and coatings.\n\nTo know more about this market research visit: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/isocyanates-market\n\nOrganic compounds that contain an isocyanate group are referred to as isocyanates. Isocyanate is the functional group with the formula R-N=C=O. An isocyanate that has two isocyanate groups is known as a di-isocyanate and those with multiple isocyanate groups are known as polisocyanates. Polyisocyanate contain multiple isocyanate groups and are derived from di-isocyanates. HDI biuret and HDI isocyanurate are among major types of polyisocyanate. If a di-isocyanate is treated with a compound containing two or more hydroxyl groups, such as a diol or a polyol, the polymer chains are formed, which are known as polyurethanes. Isocyanates are manufactured by reaction of amines and phosgene and react with water to form carbon dioxide.\n\nThe global isocyanates market can be classified on the basis of types of isocyanates and applications of isocyanates. On the basis of types of isocyanates the market can be segmented into methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), aliphatic isocyanate, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and others (including HDI isocyanurate and HDI biuret). Among the types of isocyanates, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate are the dominant types of isocyanate. Based on the applications of isocyanate, the global isocyanates market can be divided into rigid foam, flexible foam, paints and coatings, sealants and adhesives, elastomers and binders, and others.\n\nThe major hindrances in the growth of isocyanates market are higher raw material cost and huge investments required in research and development (R&D) and technology. Owing to the rising feedstock costs, the major challenge in the isocyanate market is its increasing prices. As the major feedstock for isocyanate is derived from crude oil (in the production of certain isocyanates such as toluene diisocyanate), the volatility in crude oil price has affected the price of raw materials.\n\nThe global isocyanates market is consolidated and dominated by few major players. Asia-Pacific dominates the global isocyanates market due to high usage of isocyanate in various end-user industries such as construction, electronics and automotive.. Europe is the second largest market for isocyanates, Asia-Pacific, especially China has traditionally been the largest producer and exporter of polyurethane materials, owing to availability of cheap labour, raw materials and local government support.\n\nRequest for Table of Content: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/enquiry-form.php?enqid=195&title=TOC\n\nMajor competitors in the global isocyanates market are Ashai Kasei Corporation, BASF SE, Bayer MaterialScience AG, Chemtura Corporation, Huntsman International LLC., The Dow Chemical Company, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., Hebei Cangzhou New Century Foreign Trade Co., Ltd., Evonik Industries Ag, DAHUA GROUP CO., LTD.., Wanhua Chemical Group Co., Ltd. and Vencorex.\n\nAbout P&S Market Research\n\nP&S Market Research is a global market research and consulting company.

It is conventionally produced using various products derived from petroleum including benzene, phenol and cyclohexane. However, phenol has been eliminated as a raw material for producing adipic acid due to shift in hydrocarbons market, while, cyclohexane was being primarily used as a substitute is a mainstream product now for the globally produced adipic acid.\n\nIncreasing commercial use of bio-adipic acid is a major trend being witnessed in this market owing to increased manufacturer and consumer understanding about carbon footprint reduction. Adoption of bio-adipic acid by various industries has increased due to increased demand for environment-friendly processes of chemical manufacturing owing to the harmful effects of petroleum-based processes on the environment. One of the major drivers in the market is automotive industry which is witnessing an increase in application of nylon 6,6, the main application segment of adipic acid. Nylon 6,6 is being used in automobiles extensively to reduce total weight which increases fuel efficiency.\n\nVolatility in the price of raw materials, especially benzene and the rising prices of crude oil are a major restraint to the synthetic adipic acid market. Also, stringent environmental regulations considering adipic acid usage are acting as a restraint in the global adipic acid market. These concerns have lead to the shift of demand from synthetic to bio-based adipic acid. Bio-based adipic acid also provides economical feasibility compared to the synthetic adipic acid.\n\nThe opportunity lies in the market with bio-based adipic acid which has shown feasibility and is presently in its progress stage.

While the recent crisis in Ukraine has strained political relations, shared ventures in the lucrative energy industry continue regardless.\n\nWhen German families spend cosy nights in their gas-heated homes this winter, they can once again thank the natural gas fields of northern Russia.\n\nSome 4,000 kilometres away in western Siberia, German and Russian firms are jointly at work to produce and transport fuel. It is a vital source for Germany from the country's largest energy supplier.\n\nLast year, Russian imports covered 31 per cent of Germany's oil and gas needs at a cost of 22 billion euros (25 billion dollars).\n\nEnergy cooperation is the backbone of German-Russian economic ties and is largely independent of the two countries' often strained political relations. Despite sanctions imposed on Russia over Moscow's role in the Ukraine conflict, several mega deals in 2015 have bolstered the energy cooperation.\n\nAt the centre of such deals are a few actors who enjoy a long history of doing business together. Natural gas began flowing to Germany from the former Soviet Union in 1970.\n\nIn St Petersburg on Monday, the German chemical giant BASF and its subsidiary Wintershall is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their partnership with Russia's state-owned company Gazprom.\n\nWintershall and Gazprom are linked in a joint venture called Achimgaz that produces natural gas near the city of Novy Urengoi. Wintershall is also a stakeholder in the nearby gas field of Yuzhno Rosskoe, where the German energy utility Eon owns a share.\n\nIn addition, Gazprom, BASF and Eon are partners in the Baltic Sea pipeline project to link the Russian town of Wyborg to the north-eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The pipeline can transport up to 55 billion cubic metres of gas annually.\n\nIn early September, these partners agreed on the construction of a second pipeline in the Baltic, a project which also brings the Netherlands' Shell, Austria's OMV and Engie of France to the table. On completion of the new pipeline, the partners' natural gas transport capacity is expected to double.\n\nEarlier this month, BASF and Gazprom agreed on a huge exchange of shares in a deal set to give the German firm further stakes in the gas fields of western Siberia. The Russians gained Wintershall's gas storage and trading business, a move which places one full quarter of German storage capacity in Russian hands.\n\nThe politically sensitive deal had been put on ice in 2014 because of sanctions imposed over Russia's military presence in eastern Ukraine, but was later revived, bringing Gazprom boss Alexei Miller one step closer to holding the complete operational chain - from production in Russia to the end user in Germany.\n\nRussian oligarch Mikhail Fridman has emerged as a newcomer in German-Russian energy dealings. Last year, he paid 5 billion euros (5.7 billion dollars) to take over the German firm DEA, a subsidiary of the energy utility giant RWE, in a deal that assured him a one-fifth share of Germany's oil and gas production.\n\nNow Fridman's firm, LetterOne, is negotiating with Eon to buy up the company's oil and gas fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, according to press reports.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly pointed out Russia's reliability in meeting its supply obligations to Western Europe.\n\nAmid disputes with the West, President Vladimir Putin has announced aims to re-direct the country's business towards China, which has nonetheless been slow to get off the ground. Business with Germany and the European Union is much simpler.\n\nRussia is also keen to eliminate the need for Ukraine as a transit country through pipeline development. This has proven easier in the north thanks to the Baltic Sea pipeline, while the southern option of building a pipeline through the Black Sea remains problematic. Miller recently scaled down Gazprom's plans for a planned Turkish Stream pipeline to the West.\n\nAlthough EU sanctions against Russia are not slowing down the energy business, companies do regard them as bothersome. The restrictions make deals more expensive and have blocked the transfer of specialized western technology needed to tap into difficult-to-develop oil and gas deposits.\n\nThe pain has also been felt at Germany's BASF, which is to present the results of a survey at Monday's anniversary event purporting to show that 62 per cent of the public no longer find the sanctions against Russia helpful.", "The report \"Liquid Feed Supplements Market by type (Protein, Minerals, Vitamins, and Others), Source (Molasses, Corn, Urea, and Others), Livestock (Ruminants, Poultry, Swine, Aquaculture, and Others), and by Region - Global Forecast to 2020\", The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2015 to reach a projected value of USD 5.53 Billion by 2020.\n\nBrowse 75 market data Tables and 56 Figures spread through 173 Pages and in-depth TOC on \"Liquid Feed Supplements Market\"\n\nhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/liquid-feed-supplements-market-178353765.html\n\nEarly buyers will receive 10% customization on this report.\n\nThe Liquid Feed Supplements Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2015 to 2020, owing to the increasing demand for products derived from livestock, rising awareness about animal health & feed quality, a solution to poor pasture, increasing availability of liquid by-products, and R&D activities in the animal feed industry. Hence, liquid feed supplements will be viewed as a business opportunity in the next five years as many multinational players have entered into the production of various types of liquid feed supplements products.\n\nSignificant growth in liquid feed supplements, especially molasses, was observed in the Asia-Pacific region\n\nThe molasses segment is mainly driven by the adoption of liquid feed supplements in emerging countries such as India, China, Brazil, and Japan. Further, the technological advancements, increasing awareness, improving financial condition of farmers, and affordability are changing in these developing countries, which drive the market for liquid feed supplements in these countries. Majority of the Liquid Feed Supplements Market in developing nations is still untapped and has a huge potential to grow.

It was originally published on the Elite Connect platform.\n\nThere's no doubt China is currently experiencing a high level of volatility in its domestic economy, but the potential for European firms to target Chinese funds for investment remains strong.\n\nIt's not so long since the regulatory constraints restricting Chinese investors from investing abroad were lifted, and European investments continue to be seen as an attractive market for the Chinese.\n\nMany European IROs are focusing on embracing this interest, but the approach to engaging with this investor base needs to place quality over quantity when it comes to forging relationships, as Dominic Mattiucci, targeting expert at Ipreo, observes.\n\n'We're certainly seeing an increase in European IROs going to China to maximize Chinese interest in European markets,' he says. 'What is different, though, is the nature of building connections there; it's very much a case of nurturing relationships over longer periods of time, getting onto an investor's radar and staying there. Facetime is crucial: the Chinese really do place a lot of value on face-to-face meetings so one-to-ones- and many of them - are commonplace.'\n\nIn targeting China, it's important to distinguish between the two distinct investor types - nationalized funds and private funds - as nationalized funds lack interest in investing in foreign equities.\n\nPerhaps the ultimate way of engaging with Chinese investors is to establish a local IR function in the region, a method employed by BASF, as Martin Liedemit, deputy head of investor relations, explains: 'It's not the norm for European companies to have IROs based within Asia, but we took the decision about two and a half years ago to establish a local IR function to boost our connections as the market developed. Our presence there means that, as well as China, we can concentrate on other Asian markets such as Japan, Singapore and South Korea.'\n\nEuropean firms have a lot to gain from seeking Chinese investment, but the figures don't always reflect this overall potential. Latest figures from Ipreo reveal that while 2015's first, second and third quarters showed a continual increase in the growth rate for Chinese investment into European companies (up 9 percent, 27 percent and 38 percent over the same period last year, respectively), initial indications show a first quarter decrease in this growth to 16 percent.\n\n'Publicly available information coming out of China is always very slight, so it's difficult to know whether IR activity is materializing into investment,' Mattiucci concludes. 'What is clear is that although targeting China requires an investment of time, money and resources, overall figures for 2015 show this to be a worthwhile focus for European IROs.'\n\nCurrent Chinese investment in European equities by sector\n\n* Financial services 46%\n\n* Energy 19%\n\n* Utilities 15%\n\n* Technology 12%\n\n* Other 8%\n\nSource: Ipreo", "29 Feb 2016 12:02:23\n\nWaterproofing chemicals are additives that are used to safeguard from leakages.

The motion stated that \"the government knows those statements are not true ... If this order is permitted to stand, it will only be a matter of days before some other prosecutor, in some other important case, before some other judge, seeks a similar order using this case as precedent.\"\n\nIn the motion, Apple claimed this case could have far-reaching effects beyond the FBI compelling Apple to create an iPhone backdoor.\n\n\"If it succeeds here against Apple, there is no reason why the government could not deploy its new authority to compel other innocent and unrelated third-parties to do its bidding in the name of law enforcement,\" Apple wrote, describing ways the government could manipulate pharmaceutical companies or journalists in similar ways. \"Indeed, under the government's formulation, any party whose assistance is deemed 'necessary' by the government falls within the ambit of the All Writs Act.\"\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook followed a similar line of logic in his first public interview on the topic. Cook repeated a number of times in the interview with ABC News that in his view this case \"is not about one phone; it is about the future.\n\n\"Some things are hard and some things are right and some things are both. This is one of those things,\" Cook said. \"Think about this -- it is, in our view, the software equivalent of cancer -- is this something that should be created? Technology can do many things, but there are many things technology should never be allowed to do. And, the way you don't allow it is to not create it.\"\n\nWhere the FBI framed the case as a matter of national security, Cook framed it as a matter of personal security and said someone's smartphone often has more personal information on it than can be found in their house, including banking information and the location of their children.\n\nCook argued what many infosec experts have argued in the past -- that \"there's no such thing as a backdoor for the good guys; the bad guys will find it too.\" Cook even noted that the government isn't necessarily the best place for a master key or iPhone backdoor to be held, as evidenced by the millions who have had their information stolen in breaches of federal agencies like OPM.\n\nPublic polls on the topic showed the country is divided in supporting Apple with the majority currently supporting the FBI. A recent poll from the Pew Research Center found that 51% of those surveyed thought Apple should help the FBI unlock the phone, 38% said Apple shouldn't, and 11% were undecided.\n\nCook said he understood why people felt that way, but also said that the more people learn about why Apple has taken the stance it has, the more people are siding with Apple.\n\n\"What I've seen is people understand what is at stake here and increasing numbers support us,\" Cook said in the interview with ABC. \"I have gotten thousands of emails since this occurred and the largest single category of people are from the military. These are men and women who fight for our freedom and our liberty, and they want us to stand up and be counted on this issue for them.\"\n\nHigh-profile support in this case has been somewhat mixed. Michael Hayden, former director of both the NSA and CIA who has been a vocal advocate of strong encryption, said that he opposes this effort.\n\n\"Jim [Comey] would like a back door available to American law enforcement in all devices globally,\" Hayden said in an interview. \"And, frankly, I think on balance that actually harms American safety and security, even though it might make Jim's job a bit easier in some specific circumstances.\"\n\nFormer Microsoft founder and CEO Bill Gates said this case could set a bad precedent and said there should be a balance \"between safeguards against government power and security.\"\n\nMicrosoft itself has come out in support of Apple. Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer, said the company would file an amicus brief next week, which is a filing that allows parties not directly involved in the case to weigh in. Twitter has also reportedly planned a similar filing in support of Apple, as have Google and Facebook who had previously stated support.\n\nUltimately, this looks to be a long and drawn out fight. And Tim Cook has said that Apple is prepared to take this case all the way to the Supreme Court if need be.", "Apple CEO Tim Cook got a standing ovation Friday at his first stockholder meeting since his company's epic clash with the FBI unfolded. He defended the company's unbending stand by saying: \"These are the right things to do.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the FBI unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a murderous extremist in San Bernardino.\n\nFederal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. But Apple contends the order would force it to write a program that would make other iPhones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals.\n\nTech companies are rallying to Apple's cause, and now plan a joint \"friend of the court\" brief on its behalf. Facebook said it will join with Google, Twitter and Microsoft on a court filing. A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file several briefs.\n\nApple filed court papers on Thursday that asked federal Magistrate Sheri Pym to reverse her order on the grounds that the government had no legal authority to force the company to weaken the security of its own products. The company accused the government of seeking \"dangerous power\" through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nThe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing that 51 percent of Americans think Apple should help the government unlock the iPhone.\n\nBut it's unclear how the controversy might affect Apple's business. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most Americans think about Apple or its products.\n\nCook offered only brief remarks about the FBI case, and most questions from shareholders concerned other aspects of Apple's business. But the CEO won praise during the meeting from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Internet rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\"We applaud your leadership,\" said Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. \"I recall the FBI wiretapping Dr. King in the civil rights movement. We cannot go down this path again. Some of us do remember the days of (former FBI director J. Edgar) Hoover and McCarthy and Nixon and enemies lists.\"", "APPLE VALLEY -- Authorities quickly responded to a call about a vehicle having been hit by a train Friday afternoon near Dale Evans Parkway.\n\nApple Valley Fire Protection District Capt.

It is a major turn off. Improper hygiene causes yellowing of the teeth. Teeth turns yellow due to various reasons.\n\nBut most importantly it is an improper oral care regimen that we follow, which can lead to the formation of plaque and tartar on the teeth.\n\nFoods such as wine, tea, coffee and soda can stain the teeth and darken your smile. But, there are also a handful of foods that can help whiten the teeth.\n\nEven though they are not effective as chemical treatments, they are totally natural and do not harm the teeth in any way. Of late, the chemicals have also found to be quite dangerous to the health. Hence, going natural is the best option.\n\nSo, include these foods in your diet to get healthy and white teeth. A balanced diet is essential for healthy teeth. These foods help to maintain the health of the teeth. They also help in fighting tooth decay. These foods make the teeth shiny and white naturally.\n\nIn this article, we at Boldsky are listing out some of the amazing foods that help to whiten the teeth naturally. Read on and do include these foods in your daily diet to maintain a proper oral health.\n\nBroccoli\n\nEating raw broccoli can help to polish and clean the teeth. The iron present in broccoli provides protection to the teeth against the enamel-degrading acid that is produced by the bacteria. This in turn helps to prevent stains and cavities in the teeth.\n\nApple\n\nChewing on apples helps to scrub the teeth. Apple is packed with malic acid, which is used as an ingredient in toothpastes. Malic acid increases the saliva production that helps to clean the teeth and it also helps to remove the stains.\n\nStrawberry\n\nStrawberry also contains malic acid that acts as a natural astringent. Eating them will do the trick. It can also be mixed with some baking soda to clean the teeth.\n\nSeeds And Nuts\n\nSince seeds and nuts are abrasive in nature, consuming them rubs plaque and stains off the surface of the teeth. They also contain proteins that help to whiten the teeth.\n\nPears\n\nPear is yet another food that can be used to whiten the teeth. It neutralises the pesky staining bacteria on the teeth. Increased saliva production brought about by this fruit washes away the food debris, leaving the teeth sparkly white.\n\nCarrots\n\nCarrots are one of the best foods that help to whiten the teeth by stimulating saliva. Saliva aids in washing away the food debris and it also strengthens the gums.\n\nprev next Show Thumbnail", "CEO Tim Cook defends Apple's resistance in FBI iPhone case\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif.

It has also exposed the absence of a unified code of ethics in an increasingly crucial realm of technology.\n\nUnlike older professions -- medicine with the Hippocratic oath, the law with its codes of conduct -- cybersecurity has no codified ethical standards.\n\nThat's made much of the debate over the FBI's demands and Apple's resistance about more than the legal argument.\n\nThere is no single reason such ethical standards don't yet exist, or even a consensus that they should -- let alone exactly what they might consist of or what impact they might have.\n\nWhile there is overwhelming support for Apple inside the industry, outside -- in law enforcement, in government and even around dinner tables -- the lack of clearly communicated ethical lines contributes to some of the questions raised.\n\n\"If you could prevent a 9/11-type attack from happening by unlocking an iPhone, would you do it?\" wrote one recent commenter on a Chronicle story on the issue.\n\nAnother shot back: \"If Apple loses this, your kids will be less safe. Their locations will be exposed to hackers and the government.\"\n\nPerhaps this dispute, now playing out in federal court, might lead to a clearer idea on what rules should apply.\n\nOn Thursday, the Cupertino company filed a motion to vacate a federal magistrate's mandate that Apple comply with the FBI's request.\n\nIn fighting the court order, Apple is making both a legal and moral appeal.\n\nIf it agrees to break into just one iPhone on behalf of U.S. law enforcement, it argues, it could face an undue burden to do so elsewhere.\n\nSome experts have made the case that it would leave Apple open not just to demands from other U.S. law enforcement agencies, but possibly also to similar pressure from authoritarian countries with abysmal human rights records.\n\nThe company says it should not be compelled to take that risk, or the risk of creating software that it fears could be used to access data securely stored on its other products.\n\nOn a practical level, Apple's argument might be meant to assure individuals that they can entrust their iPhone with financial information (Apple Pay), health information (ResearchKit) and even fingerprints (Touch ID).\n\nBut without agreed-upon standards of ethics, says Ryan Kalember, a senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint, a Sunnyvale cloud-security company, it's difficult for people to determine whether Apple is on solid ground.\n\n\"In what ways should they be a conscientious objector?\" he said. \"On what principles and morals?\"\n\nMixed emotions\n\nBasically, \"Apple is saying we could (help the FBI), but we shouldn't,\" said David Brumley, the director of CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University's security and privacy institute.\n\nLaw enforcement, meanwhile, is saying that while that might be so, it still needs to solve crimes, he said.\n\nBrumley agrees that the lack of ethical standards makes the situation difficult to judge. \"I don't think there's an industry-wide definition,\" he said. \"There's a lot of discussion of ethics, but that really hasn't involved modern computer security and privacy experts.\"\n\nWhile computer science students learn basic codes of conduct, professional security engineers are often more driven by a sense of morality. A majority are committed to universal rights, chief among them a user's right to privacy. It's a tenet apparent in their work.\n\nSafeguards, such as those that thwart attackers from guessing an iPhone's passcode an unlimited amount of times, are installed with individual security in mind.\n\n\"We are in the largest crime wave the human race has ever seen, and that massive amount of crime (the loss of information through cyberattacks) cannot be ignored,\" said security researcher Dan Kaminsky. \"There are individual events that are awful, but we have to talk about the universal vulnerability threatening our civilization.\n\n\"People are losing their businesses. People are losing their jobs,\" he added. \"People are losing face in information technology itself, with good reason.\"\n\nThat sentiment, shared by many in the cybersecurity industry, is pervasive in Silicon Valley. Kaminsky concedes, however, that the sense of moral urgency he and other insiders feel isn't being articulated well to the rest of society.\n\nMorality different\n\nBut morality, or an individual's personal belief, is not the same as ethics, or what the community as a whole expects from individuals, said Brumley.\n\nOn another level, Apple, which is famously close-mouthed about its products, is essentially the only source for what is possible or not regarding accessing its software. That makes some skeptical of its supposedly principled stand.\n\n\"I think it's good that Apple is framing things in this matter, trying to attend to the consequences to human, democratic rights, but I also think that Apple is a little disingenuous in making these arguments,\" said Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science at UC Davis.\n\nWhile he is firmly on Apple's side in the showdown, he said: \"They don't seem to have acknowledged that it's really a failure of their own security architecture that they have the ability to comply with this order.\"\n\n\"Apple has been claiming for quite a long time that even their latest phones are designed in such a way that they can't unlock the data at rest,\" Rogaway added. \"I think that's not really true.\"\n\n\"The challenge, in cases like this, is the definition of welfare, of the public good, and the definition of safety is being defined differently by Apple on the one hand and the (Justice Department) on the other,\" said Andrea Matwyshyn, a law professor at Northeastern University.\n\nA cybersecurity ethics code could include exceptions for instances where the normal rules wouldn't apply, said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\"In almost all (written codes of conduct), there are law enforcement exceptions,\" he said. \"If your client is going to tell you they are going to commit a crime, for instance, attorney-client privilege goes out the window.\"\n\nBut not everyone thinks that such a code can, or even should, exist.\n\n\"The difference with doctors and lawyers is that they are licensed by the states and therefore the state's law enforces ethical standards,\" said Tenable Network Security strategist Cris Thomas, a member of the hacker collective L0pht Heavy Industries, who goes by the name Space Rogue, in an email.\n\n\"There are no such review boards for car mechanics or plumbers, which are usually also licensed by the state,\" he said. \"Should there be an ethics review board for (information security) professionals like there are for doctors and lawyers?\"\n\nHis answer: \"Not until the states force infosec people to become licensed like doctors and lawyers.\"", "CEO Tim Cook defends Apple's resistance in FBI iPhone case\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif.

I've been at Apple shareholder meetings -- O K, I'm dating myself here -- when investors stormed the citadel and called for the CEO's head.\n\nApple investors at the annual meeting on Friday might have demanded the company break open the iPhone for the FBI, the controversy that has embroiled the company for the past two weeks, and move past this distraction to other projects that could improve the bottom line: conquering new markets (India) and launching new products (the rumored Apple car), to name two.\n\nInstead, the 200 or so shareholders cheered Tim Cook, who in turn thanked them for their support over the past two weeks. It must have been a good feeling for Cook after all the heat he has gotten from law enforcement, politicians and average citizens who wonder why the company is taking a stand over an issue involving a terrorist case.\n\nIf he is feeling the pressure of \"being in the news lately,\" as he put it in an understated way, Cook didn't show it.\n\n\"We are a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety,\" said Cook, casually perched on a stool with his iPad at the ready. \"We do these (things) because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn't scare us.\"\n\nCook's appearance in front of shareholders capped quite a week for the company.\n\nApple is caught in a war of words with the FBI and the U.S. government over the encryption of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino assailants responsible for the death of 14 people and the serious injury of 22 in December.\n\nThe dispute was the topic of a congressional hearing this week and even became part of the GOP presidential debate Thursday night. The company has received the support of key tech companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google.\n\nAlso Thursday, Apple responded to a court order that it comply with the FBI's request to help law enforcement gain access to the phone's contents. Apple said that forcing the company to write software to hack the phone was a form of \"compelled speech,\" among other arguments, claiming that Apple was entitled to First Amendment protections.\n\nCook made a 30-minute appearance this week on ABC News defending the company's stance, sounding populist themes about protecting our digital privacy.\n\nThere, in trying to make a point about how serious the situation is, Cook compared cracking the iPhone's protections to writing the \"software equivalent of cancer.\"\n\nI thought that metaphor, which he repeated several times, was a rare misstep on Cook's part. Hyperbole, as we know from watching the GOP presidential candidates debate, can be very useful.\n\nBut Apple has to be extremely careful how it portrays this dilemma -- and overstating the situation can backfire both in court and in the court of public opinion. So far, people are roughly divided evenly in support of Apple and the FBI, polls show.\n\nAnd meanwhile, there are plenty of other pressure point for Apple, which, after all, is a global company with a lot at stake.\n\nAt the annual meeting, shareholders held forth about other topics such as how retail stores could better serve the business community and Apple's future in China and India. Apple has big hopes for India, was Cook's message.\n\nWhen will the new campus be finished, one person asked: January 2017.\n\n\"Steve spent the last couple years of his life really dedicating himself to that project. It will be the center of innovation for years to come,\" Cook said, referring to Apple co-founder and former chief executive, Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd is Apple making an iCar?\n\nCook: \"Remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting and you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? It's going to be Christmas Eve for awhile.\"\n\nShareholders voted down a proposal asking the company to accelerate the recruitment process of senior leadership in order to make those ranks more diverse.\n\nBut even the Rev. Jesse Jackson of the RainbowPush Coalition didn't dwell on diversity and tech, one of his top issues.\n\nInstead, he applauded the company for its stance in its running battle with the FBI, saying there has to be a way that supports \"personal freedom and privacy and supports the needs of law enforcement and national security.\" He evoked an era in U.S. history when law enforcement created an enemies list of civil rights leaders who were monitored.\n\n\"Those who have no regard for human rights, if they have the power to order a company to open up files, there are no limits,\" Jackson told me.\n\nCook did his job well on Friday, projecting a quiet calm and unwavering commitment to the issue. I hope he had a chance to savor the moment.\n\nOther venues Cook may go to in the coming months won't be as friendly.", "Apple shareholders have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would require the board of America's largest company to adopt an \"accelerated recruitment policy\" for minorities among company leaders.\n\nThe result offered a fresh reminder how Silicon Valley, a meritocracy dominated by white men, is having a tricky time navigating identity politics and modern attitudes towards diversity. The proposal, which wasn't expected to pass, failed 94.9% to 5.1%, according to an early tally announced at Apple's annual shareholder meeting at company headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nApple's board had urged investors to vote it down, telling shareholders that the measure would be too restrictive. Speaking afterward, chief executive Tim Cook said: \"There's much more work to do on diversity across the company. I can commit to you we are working very hard on it.\"\n\nOf Apple's 18 named executives on its website, Cook is one of the 15 that are both white and male. There are then three women, two of whom are black. Apple's eight-member board includes two women and one black man, James Bell, the former Boeing chief financial officer.\n\nThe measure was being pushed by civil rights groups, with the Rev Jesse Jackson attending to push for support just before Apple announced the result of the vote.\n\n\"Ironically, Apple is already moving in this direction,\" Jackson told shareholders. \"The world is diverse ... We should not position ourselves to react to inclusion, which leads to growth.\"\n\nUntil recently Apple had a director of \"worldwide inclusion and diversity\", Jeffrey Siminoff, but he was poached by Twitter in December 2015.

The company accused the government of seeking \"dangerous power\" through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nThe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing 51 percent of Americans think Apple should cooperate by helping the government unlock the iPhone.\n\nThe FBI and other law-enforcement agencies insist they need to get into the phone in order to run down every lead in the San Bernardino shootings, which were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State extremist group. But skeptics have questioned whether this particular device -- a work phone issued by one shooter's employer -- is likely to contain much useful information. Both assailants took care to destroy their personal phones prior to the massacre.\n\nSome police officials acknowledge similar doubts. \"If they went out of their way to destroy the other phones, there's a pretty good chance there may not be anything of value,\" said Jarrod Burguan, San Bernardino's police chief. \"This may be a whole lot of saber rattling and back and forth for nothing.\" Burguan, however, believes police still have \"a duty and a responsibility\" to make sure there's no useful evidence on the phone.\n\nIt's unclear how the controversy might affect Apple's business. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most Americans think about Apple or its products.\n\nAt least one shareholder at Friday's meeting voiced support for the company's stance.\n\n\"Apple is 100 percent correct in not providing or doing research to create software to break into it,\" said Tom Rapko, an Apple investor from Santa Barbara, California, as he waited in line to enter the auditorium at Apple's headquarters. \"I think if you give the government an inch, they'll take a yard.\"\n\nCook offered only brief remarks about the FBI case, and most questions from shareholders concerned other aspects of Apple's business.

So far, people are roughly divided evenly in support of Apple and the FBI, polls show.\n\nAnd meanwhile, there are plenty of other pressure point for Apple, which, after all, is a global company with a lot at stake.\n\nAt the annual meeting, shareholders held forth about other topics such as how retail stores could better serve the business community and Apple's future in China and India. Apple has big hopes for India, was Cook's message.\n\nWhen will the new campus be finished, one person asked: January 2017.\n\n\"Steve spent the last couple years of his life really dedicating himself to that project. It will be the center of innovation for years to come,\" Cook said, referring to Apple co-founder and former chief executive, Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd is Apple making an iCar?\n\nCook: \"Remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting and you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? It's going to be Christmas Eve for awhile.\"\n\nShareholders voted down a proposal asking the company to accelerate the recruitment process of senior leadership in order to make those ranks more diverse.\n\nBut even the Rev. Jesse Jackson of the RainbowPush Coalition didn't dwell on diversity and tech, one of his top issues.\n\nInstead, he applauded the company for its stance in its running battle with the FBI, saying there has to be a way that supports \"personal freedom and privacy and supports the needs of law enforcement and national security.\" He evoked an era in U.S. history when law enforcement created an enemies list of civil rights leaders who were monitored.\n\n\"Those who have no regard for human rights, if they have the power to order a company to open up files, there are no limits,\" Jackson told me.\n\nCook did his job well on Friday, projecting a quiet calm and unwavering commitment to the issue. I hope he had a chance to savor the moment.\n\nOther venues Cook may go to in the coming months won't be as friendly.", "The chair of a key House subcommittee is siding with Apple in its dispute over an FBI court order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nRep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), who oversees the House Subcommittee on Information Technology, said he worries about the precedent that Apple's compliance might set.\n\nThe FBI is asking Apple to create software to disable a failsafe that triggers the phone to wipe its own memory after 10 failed attempts to enter the pass code. Such a change would allow investigators to hack into Syed Farook's phone.

Still, decisions need to be made, and good policy can be formulated in uncertain situations, just as health authorities had to respond to the Zika outbreak though little was known about its potential health consequences.\n\nIn the Apple case, decisions will affect the way we balance the fight against terrorism with concerns over the erosion of privacy in a world increasingly dependent on smart phones to track and guide people's lives.\n\nThe phone in question belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, who, along with his wife, shot 14 people in San Bernardino last December. Unlocking it may not sound like a hard problem for the technical wizards at Apple, but computer scientists and cryptography experts say it may indeed be impossible, which is what the company claimed in a letter to customers issued Feb. 16. Apple set up the security system so even its creators can't break into a customer's phone without creating new software to make it possible.\n\nThe hard part is bypassing a feature that deletes sensitive data if someone types in an incorrect password more than 10 times. That's important because it's surprisingly easy to guess a six-digit password.\n\nA back door is an intentional weakness in the system that allows a group that's in the know to get in.\n\nIf not for such a limit, the FBI, or hackers for that matter, could use what's been called a brute force approach to try every combination of six numerals until they hit on the right one. There are a total of 1,000,000 such combinations, and on average it should take about half a million guesses before the system is cracked.\n\nThat's a lot of tapping for a person who steals a phone, but not for a fast computer, said Cornell University computer scientist Steven Wicker. Most computer science grad students could create such a system to enter perhaps 1,000 possible passwords per second, he said. That would hit upon to the right one in 15 minutes or less, depending on luck.\n\nCode makers stay ahead of code breakers by making strings of characters so long that it would take an eternity to try even a fraction of the possibilities.\n\nThe fact that codes can be made to withstand brute force attacks, at least for the next few million years, allows people to send credit card information over the Internet with reasonable safety, said Indrajit Ray, a computer scientist from Colorado State University.\n\nThey're being asked to create a tool that could potentially break into any iPhone.\n\nIn a simple example, he said, imagine the formula A + B = C. A is your secret number. B is a number only known to a colleague you want to receive your secret message. Your colleague sees C and subtracts to discover A, but a hacker, picking up just C, would have to guess every possible value of B to get to your secret. If C is 1,000, that might not be so hard, but if it's 20 billion or trillion, it gets unwieldy.\n\nIn the real world, encryption systems are more complicated but the idea is the same - some operation shuffles your secret numbers and only those holding a key can unshuffle them. To keep the key safe from brute force, it has to be big.\n\nApple can't rely on large numbers to keep passcodes safe, because it would mean using more than 40 digits. \"It's a human factor\", said Cornell's Wicker. People would refuse to do it or would choose strings of a single digit, thus defeating the purpose.\n\nSo instead, iPhones include a security option to erase data after 10 incorrect attempts to guess a password. To disable it will mean writing new operating system software. This is what the experts are calling a back door.\n\n\"A back door is an intentional weakness in the system that allows a group that's in the know to get in,\" said Wicker. Apple doesn't already have a back door into iPhones, and so, the company claims, one would have to be created. \"They're being asked to create a tool that could potentially break into any iPhone,\" Wicker said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Juha Saarinen: Only losers in the iPhone backdoor saga\n\n* Apple to fight order to help FBI unlock shooter's iPhone\n\n* Judge: Apple must help US hack San Bernardino killer's phone\n\nRay, the computer scientist from Colorado State, compared it to a situation in which there's a secure storage facility with no master key. Imagine that the FBI wanted to get into one of the lockers, he said, but only the owner knows how the locks work.\n\nCan the owner create a crowbar that can only open one locker but is useless for all the others?\n\nIt's hard for anyone outside Apple to know whether it's possible to make such a specialized single-locker crowbar, said Ray, since the company's software codes are secret. And yet, people on both sides of the debate tend to be sure, either that it is or is not possible.\n\nGood decision-making in cases like this rests on understanding the boundaries of current knowledge and resisting the temptation to fill in the gaps with assumptions.\n\nThere's a lot at stake, with the explosion of smart phones now tracking our whereabouts, our interests, health data, contacts and appointments. \"It's a permanent record of our daily lives,\" said Wicker, and it's potentially available to both commercial interests and the federal government. \"A lot has gone on without public debate,\" he said.\n\nThe experts laud Apple for prompting that long-needed public discussion. Court documents unsealed this week revealed that the FBI has made similar requests of Apple in nine other cases.\n\nThis is a good test case to start considering where we want to draw the line between the need to helping crime fighters and the risk of a future in which we can't keep much of anything secret.", "NEW HAVEN, Conn. (WTNH) -- The FBI is trying to force Apple to unlock the encrypted smart phone of a suspected terrorist from the San Bernardino attacks. The over-arching idea here is something every American from Connecticut to California should pay attention to. It concerns our Constitutional rights protecting us from unlawful searches, weighed against the needs of law enforcement, who has the immense job of flat out trying to protect us.\n\nSmart phones. Seemingly every adult has one. Most filled with personal conversations, records of phone calls, and in some cases even banking or medical records. Information that is usually kept closely guarded. So it's obvious that the stakes are high for this new area of American case law.\n\n\"It's landmark,\" said University of New Haven Criminal Justice Professor John DeCarlo. \"A new area of law. New area of investigation. And a new threat to privacy.\"\n\nThe FBI wants to force Apple to create software allowing access into the dead suspect's iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook responded in an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"Can the government compel Apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world?\" Cook asked.\n\nBut there are real concerns for local law enforcement. Many people, including criminals, keep their darkest secrets inside their smart phones, out of reach on encrypted devices. DeCarlo is a former police chief in Branford. He said one answer to the problem is good old fashioned, traditional police work.\n\n\"Although we do have this as a new source, it's something that didn't exist a while ago,\" DeCarlo said. \"And cases were still solved. There's nothing more in a phone that existed before except a handy repository of information.\"\n\nThat practice may be necessary. Since Apple is holding firm with it's decision to defy the feds.\n\n\"It's not just about privacy but public safety,\" Cook said.\n\nApple said they're concerned about setting a precedent if they're forced to unlock one iPhone. And just to prove how complicated this Constitutional fight is, the District Attorney in Manhattan said he has 175 iPhones from criminal cases that he cannot unlock.", "At Friday's annual meeting of Apple shareholders, CEO Tim Cook was clearly ready to field questions about the company's ongoing battle with the FBI over encryption. But nobody there seemed very interested in discussing it.\n\nThe FBI wants the Cupertino, California, tech company to help it unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. But Apple refuses, arguing that doing so would set a dangerous precedent and make all its users less safe.\n\nApple has challenged a court order to unlock the iPhone in question, citing freedom of speech.\n\nCook brought up the ongoing battle, unbidden, during his prepared remarks to the assembled Apple shareholders: \"Some of you may have questions on that,\" he said, to applause.\n\nBut overall, shareholders didn't seem that curious about the Apple-FBI fight, even if it's all that the tech world is talking about. Given that Apple's stock price hasn't moved much, even amid these battles, it seems like they don't consider it much of a risk.\n\n\"We do this because this is the right thing to do. Being hard doesn't scare us,\" Cook elaborated in his remarks. \"I'm incredibly proud to be working for this company at this time with the most unbelievable people in the world.\"\n\nThat was apparently enough for the gathering of Apple shareholders. Because when Cook ended his remarks, and the opportunity for Q&A from shareholders began -- possibly the public's one and only chance to ask the CEO of the second-most-valuable company in the world a question -- none of them even brought it up.\n\nThe only further mention of the Apple/FBI issue during the meeting was a prepared statement, not even a question, from Cindy Cohn, executive director of the prominent digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. In her statement, Cohn announced that the EFF will be filing an amicus brief in support of Apple next week, joining tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook.\n\nGetty Images/Scott OlsonThe Reverend Jesse Jackson\n\nOtherwise, shareholders had other concerns on their mind: Reverend Jesse Jackson made another appearance to urge Apple towards further diversity within the company; another asked if Apple planned to keep supporting older iPhone models with new iOS operating system software (they are).\n\nOne guy asked how Apple planned to pivot towards being a services business when he couldn't get his Beats Music and Apple Music accounts to sync up (Cook promised someone would take care of his technical issues). Someone else wanted to know how Apple views India, to which Cook responded \"we see India as basically where China was 10 years ago,\" which is to say, a big opportunity.\n\nAnother person asked about the Apple Car, to Cook's chagrin.\n\nStill, it gave Cook a chance to show off his sometimes-understated sense of humor. One questioner asked if future shareholder meetings would allow them to send Cook their questions ahead of time. A little later, Cook urged shareholders to drop him an e-mail if their question wasn't addressed during the meeting.\n\n\"It's tcook@apple.com,\" Cook said, addressing the earlier questioner. \"I'm surprised you didn't know it, it seems like everyone else in the world knows it.\"", "CUPERTINO, Calif. - Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook defended his hard-line stance against the FBI and a court order over consumer privacy as \"the right things to do\" during the company's annual investors conference Friday.\n\n\"We are a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety,\" Cook said, perched on a stool in front of about 200 shareholders. \"We've been in the news lately, and some of you may have some questions on that. We do these because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn't scare us.\"\n\nThe comments, which hinted at the company's messy, public feud with the FBI over the last two weeks, drew applause from the crowd gathered at Apple headquarters here.\n\nApple uses the event to elect corporate directors, consider shareholder proposals and take their questions.\n\nCook fielded queries about Apple's efforts to boost sales in China and India, countries crucial to growth as iPhone sales slow in the U.S. and Europe. Of Apple's almost $234 billion in sales during the last fiscal year, nearly $60 billion came from its Greater China region and about $1 billion from India, Cook said.\n\nCook expressed optimism about overcoming economic problems in China and infrastructure issues in India that have hamstrung other multinational corporations.\n\n\"If you block the noise out and just look at the numbers, China is a huge, huge opportunity,\" Cook said. \"If you're in this for the long term, as we are, China is a super market.\"\n\nOn India, he added that the lack of high-speed mobile data and other \"infrastructural brittleness\" adds complexity, but he said he's \"convinced\" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will get things fixed.\n\nBut concerns about the iPhone's prospects - as well as perceived lackluster sales of its nearly year-old Apple Watch - largely have been overshadowed by the debate over security and privacy.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple filed key court papers in its battle against the FBI, which wants the company's assistance to get past the passcode lock on a terrorist's iPhone. The agency says that without Apple's assistance, investigators' ability to fully understand the planning behind the Dec. 2 attack in San Bernardino will be thwarted.\n\nPleas for Apple to help have come from government officials and families of some of the 14 people killed in the shooting. But Apple says that obeying the court order to help the FBI would open a door for hackers and embolden law enforcement authorities to pry into customers' private data.\n\nShareholders offered mixed reactions when asked whether Apple should comply with the FBI's order.\n\n\"I do think they should unlock it,\" one shareholder, who asked not be quoted by name, said on the way into Friday's event. \"For something as serious as this, there should be a way to do it.\"\n\nAnn Hobbs, 80, said she was \"totally backing\" Cook.\n\n\"Once they open that phone, it's the beginning of the end of privacy,\" said the first-time attendee of the event.\n\nA departing Apple employee whose last day at work was Friday said he feared how far the government would go if it could compel private companies to create new products and services as the FBI wants Apple to do.\n\n\"America is unique as a country founded on individual rights, and you don't give up those rights to protect those rights,\" said Mason Weems, 50, who also owns Apple shares.\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson praised Cook for his leadership on the privacy issue during Friday's session. \"Unprecedented government overreach\" can't be tolerated even in the wake of tragedy, Jackson said.\n\nAt the meeting itself, investors were set to reelect all eight board members, who include former Vice President Al Gore, Walt Disney Co. head Bob Iger and former Avon cosmetics CEO Andrea Jung.\n\nMeanwhile, preliminary tallies showed voters rejecting four proposals from shareholders. Some called for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing diversity in the executive ranks, initiatives that Apple said it was already carrying out.\n\nShares of Apple have tumbled about 22 percent since its shareholder meeting last March.", "\"When Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, rose during the meeting at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, to praise the company, her words sparked a long round of applause from the audience, including Cook on stage,\" King and Bass report. \"'Make no mistake, all of us have our security at stake here,' Cohn said.\"\n\n\"Cook then introduced the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who thanked the CEO for the company's efforts to fight a court order that would force Apple to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the case,\" King and Bass report. \"'We oppose the unprecedented government over reach,' Jackson said. 'Some of us remember the days of Hoover and Nixon and McCarthy,' he said referring to former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, President Richard Nixon and Senator Joseph McCarthy... 'We do these because these are the right things to do,' Cook said.\"", "Mirroring those views, Smith said the United States needs \"21st-century laws that address 21st-century technology issues. And we need these laws to be written by Congress. We, therefore, agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here, to the House of Representatives and the Senate so the people who are elected by the people can make these decisions.\" Microsoft's stance on the issue is at odds with Bill Gates' take on the high-profile case. \"There's no doubt Apple can make this information available and I don't think there's any doubt that when the courts eventually rule that they'll follow whatever the court says to do,\" said the former Microsoft CEO earlier this week in an interview with the", "Congresswoman cites 'dangerous precedent' from court order forcing tech company to write access programming / free articles read.

Anna Eshoo, D-Menlo Park, said in a statement on Friday, Feb. 26, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation overreached when it went to court to force Apple to unlock the phone owned by deceased killer Syed Rizwan Farook.\n\nThe iPhone, which investigators found in Farook's car, according to news reports, is the property of his employer, the San Bernardino County Health Department, which consented to the FBI search of the phone.\n\nBut the FBI reset the phone's iCloud password, and it has been unable to unlock the phone. If the wrong password is entered 10 times, the phone's data may become scrambled, the agency has said.\n\nThe FBI sought Apple's help to unlock the phone, but Apple would have to create a new program to do so, the company has said, and it has refused to do so, citing grave future privacy-violation concerns for all Apple devices.\n\nA writ sought by the FBI from a California district court orders Apple to create a program that would give the iPhone a \"backdoor\" so that the data can be retrieved. But Apple strongly objects to the court order.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said in a statement that \"the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.\"\n\nEshoo agreed.\n\n\"As a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, I've seen first-hand the heavy damage that occurs when big government exceeds the limits set by law,\" she wrote in the statement. \"The trust of the American people has been severely diminished by many indefensible undertakings, including Cisco routers being intercepted and bugged by our government before being shipped; the allegations that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone and those of other world leaders were being tapped; and the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as it was investigating controversial detention and interrogation programs.\n\n\"What Congress would not legislate, the FBI is now seeking to accomplish through the courts,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe FBI's request sounds simple and reasonable, but the implications of this case extend beyond any one company or device, Eshoo said.\n\n\"The FBI has gone to court to force a private company to create a system solely for the purpose of the federal government to use whenever and however it wishes. This came about after the government missed a key opportunity to back-up and potentially recover information from the device by resetting the iCloud password in the days following the shooting,\" she said. \"This is a stunning overreach of the FBI to demand that a private company create a new operating system with a 'swinging door' that the federal government can enter and exit without any rules whatsoever, whenever they wish.\n\n\"The access being sought by the government is a national security issue with global implications. If forced to comply with the Court's order, Apple would not just be unlocking one phone. It would in essence be ordered to also unlock a world where our personal information is vulnerable to attacks by terrorist organizations, rogue nations and others seeking to cause the U.S. harm and instill fear,\" she continues.\n\nCongress has determined that backdoors endanger the country because they weaken security. Efforts to circumvent code that protects sensitive information on one device creates a dangerous precedent for future seizure of information and a pathway for unauthorized access of that information by hackers, foreign governments and terrorists, she added.\n\nIn an interesting twist, she quoted one of the country's most notably conservative Constitutional scholars, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn a 1987 case, Arizona vs. Hicks, Scalia wrote for the court's majority: \"But there is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.\"\n\nEshoo acknowledged the importance of law enforcement, but mass access to surveillance by the federal government is not the answer, Eshoo said.\n\n\"Our Constitution calls on us to protect and defend against enemies both foreign and domestic.

The only surviving claims are those of breach of contract on the nine trusts, which the banks did not seek to dismiss.\n\nNCUA spokesman John Fairbanks said the regulator is reviewing the decision.\n\nBank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of many in which the NCUA has sought to recoup losses on mortgage securities bought before the financial crisis, and which led to the 2009 and 2010 failures of the Constitution Corporate, Members United Corporate, Southwest Corporate, U.S. Central and Western Corporate credit unions.\n\nThe NCUA has recouped close to $2.46 billion through lawsuits it began filing in 2011, including $33 million this week from Switzerland's UBS.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nAlso in Business\n\n\u25cf A U.S. appeals court on Friday overturned a $120 million jury verdict against Samsung, finally handing the South Korean smartphone maker a significant win in its long-standing patent feud with top rival Apple.

The research findings, published today in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, is the most detailed pancreatic cancer study to date. It opens the door to new treatments for one of the most devastating and difficult to treat cancers.\n\nPancreatic cancer, the disease that felled Apple founder Steve Jobs, is among the most aggressive cancers. Less than 5 percent of diagnosed patients survive for five years and just 1 percent of those with the disease survive for 10 years after diagnosis.\n\nIt is the 9th most common cancer in men and 10th most common cancer in women in Australia, according to the Cancer Council Australia.\n\nSean Grimmond, director of research for the Centre for Cancer Research at the University of Melbourne and one of the lead architects of the study, said that the results may open new avenues for clinical trials and drug designs to better combat the disease.\n\n\"Until now we've had a very poor understanding of what drives pancreatic cancer. For the first time, we've determined the root causes behind that accumulation of genetic damage in pancreatic cancer and also the major processes that promote cancer growth and progression,\" he told The Conversation.\n\nFor seven years the research team painstakingly decoded the entire genetic blueprints of a patient's tumour and then discerned the key events that regulated the disease. The researchers did this for 456 patients with pancreatic cancer, one patient at a time.\n\nThe researchers identified four pancreatic cancers with different molecular drivers that set each sub-type apart.\n\nSub-types differed by genes and proteins as well as the cell types. The researchers identified the causes and the mutations that promote highly aggressive behaviour in some pancreatic cancers.\n\n\"This gives us a near complete playbook on how pancreatic cancer starts; what drives the cancer's development,\" said Grimmond, adding the finding could allow personalised therapy customised for each individual case.\n\nAmong the subtypes the researchers identified was the immunogenic sub-type, which has a 'cancer cloaking' ability, a molecular hallmark shared by colon cancer and melanoma.\n\nThe cancer is able to evade the body's natural immune system, which would otherwise clear potential tumours away.\n\nDetecting this ability may allow doctors to prescribe treatment aimed at inhibiting the cancer cloaking trait.\n\nMuch more research was needed, said Grimmond.\n\n\"At a molecular level, pancreatic cancer is a complicated disease. The onus is on us to harness these findings and know-how and create the means to apply similar studies to large numbers of patients, in real time, in a clinical setting,\" he said. \"Then we can develop the strategies to test these potential lead.\"\n\nRik Thompson, a professor of breast cancer research at the Queensland University of Technology said that results represented \"a terrific advance\".\n\n\"By knowing the four different sub-type and their different 'molecular drivers', the findings provide a molecular explanation as to why some patients have a very good response to therapy whilst most do not,\" said Thompson, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"Early detection will help limit the spread of pancreatic cancer to other organs, which is the major cause of pancreatic cancer mortality.\"\n\nKnowing the major pathways that sets each pancreatic cancer type apart provides targets that can be used for new therapies and immediate potential benefits for those already suffering the disease, he said.\n\nThe new research is part of a suite of studies by the International Cancer Genome Consortium.\n\n\"This study is a quantum leap in the level of understanding of pancreatic cancers and a testament to the vision and success of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. It should have far-reaching influences on our ability to manage pancreatic cancer,\" Thompson said.", "Only eight days after launching, the app that let people see the Instagram feeds of any public user has lost its API access. Being had gained 40,000 users in the days since its launch and had 11,000 people download the app in the last day. Its popularity could have been its downfall, however, especially now that Apple was putting it on its featured App Store page. The company hasn't yet confirmed whether the loss of access to Instagram's API was intentional.\n\nBeing aimed to let people see Instagram through the eyes of other users, like celebrities and friends. The app pulled together the different users people followed to recreate their feeds on the app. So, for example, a Being user could \"become\" Kim Kardashian and see all the makeup artists and friends she follows.", "An appeals court on Friday ruled that Samsung won't have to pay Apple $119.6 million for infringing its patents, reports Bloomberg. The court found two of Apple's patents, including one for its slide-to-unlock feature, to be invalid and a third wasn't infringed.\n\nToday's ruling overturns a verdict reached by a California jury in May 2014, which found Samsung devices to infringe on Apple's patents. It also upholds a decision to make Apple pay Samsung $158,400 in damages for infringing on its video compression patent.\n\nIn this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers that can then be touched to make phone calls. The autocorrect patent is invalid and the detection patent wasn't infringed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an opinion posted on its electronic docket. The court upheld the jury's verdict that two other Apple patents, for universal search and background syncing, weren't infringed.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the similar but separate ongoing patent suit between Apple and Samsung. In 2012, a jury awarded Apple $1 billion in damages, but that amount has since been cut to $548M. Samsung has appealed that case to the Supreme Court.", "Apple is holding an event on 15 March, or so it is thought. Of course nothing has been officially confirmed, nor will it be until the invites go out, but that doesn't mean we can't have some fun speculating about what to expect.\n\nThe Cupertino company notably never attends the major trade shows like MWC and IFA. Instead, especially in the case of IFA, it does its own separate event very close to the show, stealing a few headlines of its own.\n\nApple's September and June events have a much more predictable pattern than the March events, with only two previous March events to date - one in 2012 and the second in 2015. Despite this however, a March 2016 event is looking very likely based on reports. With MWC now over after stealing plenty of headlines, what will Apple announce to get back in the spotlight?\n\nApple decided not to update the iPad Air 2 during the September 2015 event where the iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro were both announced. That decision has led many to believe the iPad Air 3, or smaller iPad Pro as it has also been referred to, will be announced during the March 2016 event.\n\nReports suggest the new 9.7-inch iPad will adopt a similar design to the larger Apple iPad Pro including a four-speaker setup, Smart Connector and compatibility with the Apple Pencil. It has also been suggested that a rear LED camera flash will appear too, which would make it the first iPad to offer this feature.\n\nA newer and faster processor than the iPad Air 2 is expected and there has also been some talk of a higher resolution display, coupled with the next-generation of pressure-sensing technology. It's all a guessing game at the moment though.\n\nREAD MORE Apple iPad Air 3: What's the story so far?\n\nThe Apple iPhone 5SE, previously referred to as the iPhone 6C, is the rumoured successor to the colourful, 4-inch iPhone 5C that was announced way back in September 2013. It has been talked about for several months now, hence the different names, but it is thought it might finally reveal itself at the March event.\n\nThe iPhone 5C is no longer available to buy through Apple, making the iPhone 5S the cheaper and smaller option within the iPhone portfolio. The iPhone 5SE, if it arrives at all, is expected to replace the iPhone 5S, possibly bringing a colourful metal build with it.\n\nRumours suggest the 4-inch display will remain intact, along with the same resolution as the iPhone 5S. It also isn't likely to come with any of the newer technologies like the pressure-sensitive display found on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.\n\nREAD MORE Apple iPhone 5SE: What's the story so far?\n\nApple announced the Apple Watch in September 2014, offering further details on the wearable in March 2015 and finally releasing it for purchase in April 2015. It's been suggested we might therefore see its successor appear at the March event this year.\n\nWhat Apple will call the second-gen smartwatch is still questionable but we will go with Apple Watch 2 for now. It's been suggested that it will sport the same design and form factor as the original model, with the same rectangular screen, resolution and body.\n\nOther reports claim new materials will be added to the mix and features such as a front-facing video camera will be added, as well as a chip that will allow for better functionality when without a Bluetooth connection. With a bit of luck those super expensive straps might even still be compatible.

Today, in its second upward revision, the number of affected people now stands at over 700,000.\n\nThe Hack\n\nAs WIRED originally reported last spring, the hack gave attackers access to entire tax returns, which means people's social security numbers, address, and incomes were all compromised. The hackers used personal information already in hand to get unauthorized access through an IRS application called \"Get Transcript.\"\n\nIn other words, much of the information had already been acquired, including SSNs and dates of birth. \"Get Transcript\" has been offline since the first indications of a breach last May.\n\nWho's Affected\n\nThe initial IRS report indicated that 114,000 accounts had been compromised. It revised that number last August, raising it to 334,000. On Friday, the IRS added another 390,000 accounts to the pile, for a total of well over 700,000 people. There have also been a total of 500,000 targeted, but failed, attempts at access.\n\nThe IRS will begin mailing affected taxpayers from this most recent batch starting February 29th. If you're one of them, you also qualify for free Equifax identity theft protection for one year, and \"extra scrutiny\" on tax returns associated with your SSN.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nIn terms of the type of information that's been compromised, it's no worse than it was last May. That's still plenty bad, though; if there's information about yourself you might consider sensitive, it's probably on your tax return somewhere.\n\nWhat's more serious at this point is the extent to which the IRS underestimated the severity of the breach. It's been nearly a year. That's a long time for 390,000 people to have been vulnerable but not know it.\n\nThe revelations come at the end of a nine-month investigation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which hopefully means that it's the last of upward revisions. The IRS also notes that not all of these cases necessarily involve malevolent actors.\n\n\"TIGTA investigators identified suspicious email addresses that made multiple attempts to access accounts,\" the agency said in a statement today. \"It is possible that some of those identified may be family members, tax return preparers, or financial institutions using a single email address to attempt to access more than one account.\"\n\nFor now, just keep an eye on your mailbox next week.

Now, Motherboard reports, a hacker has threatened another federal employee dump of a much smaller scale but potentially more sensitive target: the names, titles, and contact information of nearly 30,000 FBI and Department of Homeland Security workers.\n\nThe Hack\n\nMotherboard first reported the hack on Sunday, after obtaining the data. Since then, the information of roughly several thousand DHS employees appears to have been released by anonymous sources. The 20,000 FBI employees appear not to have been exposed yet.\n\nUpdate: The FBI information has now been leaked as well. Both dumps are accompanied by pro-Palestine slogans.\n\nThe hacker told Motherboard that he was able to access the files through the compromised email account of a Department of Justice employee. He claimed to have downloaded 200GB of files, out of 1TB total available to him. That would imply that the information that's been leaked so far is just a small percentage of the total.\n\nWho's Affected\n\nAs of right now, the names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers of 9,000 DHS employees have been made public, with 20,000 FBI employees at risk of exposure as well. The hacker told Motherboard that he also had some military emails and credit card numbers, but provided neither proof nor indication that he intended to release them.\n\nThe FBI employees nearly 35,000 people, meaning that more than half of the agency's people would be at risk. It's not clear if any of the 20,000 who are involved in the hack are in sensitive positions.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nThe hack doesn't impact you directly unless you work for one of the agencies involved, and even then it seems most likely to result mostly in annoyance.\n\nWhat's more serious is that these details were accessible in the first place, through seemingly not terribly sophisticated means. These are agencies that deal in highly sensitive information; if they can't secure their digital doors, there's no reason to think any branch of government can.\n\nThen again, if even the director of the CIA can't lock down his (AOL) email account, perhaps it's wishful thinking that any other agency's employees might fair better.\n\nGo Back to Top.

On top of that, it looks like the apps are more dangerous to Apple customers than previously thought.\n\nSeveral security companies have now banded together in the search for malicious iOS apps: Claud Xiao from PaloAlto Networks has reportedly discovered 39, Fox-IT also found a number of others, a representative told WIRED in an email. Many of those apps are popular in China, such as Railway 12306, used for purchasing train tickets, and a version of WeChat, a messaging app. Only the older version 6.2.5 is infected, whereas the app's up-to-date version is clean.\n\nHowever, it appears that some affected apps are also used by Apple customers in the United States. 'CamCard', an app for scanning and storing business cards, and which was a 'Top Paid App' in 2014, is also infected, according to Palo Alto Networks.\n\nOriginally, the malware was seen to be fairly innocuous: it could siphon off only small snippets of information such as a device's ID, and the current time.\n\nBut according to findings from one researcher, and then built upon by Xiao, the infected apps are also capable of receiving commands from the attacker. These commands can apparently allow a hacker to read and write data to the victim's clipboard, open specific URLs, or prompt a fake alert on the victim's screen. Some of these could be used to steal passwords, Xiao claims.\n\nApple did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but company spokesperson Christine Monaghan told The Guardian in an email that \"We've removed the apps from the app store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,\" and that \"We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps.\"\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.\n\nThe Apple ecosystem is well known for very rarely letting any dodgy apps enter it because of the company's stringent security checks.\n\nBut recently, nearly two dozen malicious pieces of software managed to get hosted on the App Store, and subsequently downloaded by Chinese users. This is because attackers found an unorthodox route to exploit: they targeted some versions of the software used by developers to makes apps for iOS and OS X in the first place.\n\nThe Hack\n\nThe malware was first highlighted by Chinese developers on Weibo, and was then analyzed by researchers from Alibaba. Security company Palo Alto Networks then verified the results.\n\nThe hack all hinges around Xcode, a tool used to create iOS and OS X apps. Typically, Xcode is downloaded directly from Apple for free. However, it is possible to get Xcode from other sources too, such as developer forums. Some versions of Xcode found on Baidu Yunpan, a Chinese file-sharing service, come packaged with extra lines of code. The Alibaba researchers have dubbed these malicious variants \"XcodeGhost.\"\n\nApps constructed with XcodeGhost code will collect a bunch of information about a customer's device once the app has been downloaded. The data siphoned includes the current time, the name of the device, and the network type -- none of which is anything a hacker could really use against you.\n\nOne of the apps that passed Apple's security checks was NetEase Cloud Music, which, according to a screenshot provided by Palo Alto Networks, has nearly 500 ratings, averaging out at four and a half stars. Claud Xiao, a senior malware researcher from Palo Alto Networks, tells WIRED in an email the company had verified over 20 apps that were infected.\n\n\"Some of them are very popular and have tens of millions of installations,\" Xiao writes.\n\nWho's Affected?\n\nThe iOS users who downloaded these apps, first of all. However, the apps analyzed were reportedly only from the Chinese App Store, so it doesn't look like customers from other areas of the world need to worry.\n\nAlso, any developers who obtained their copy of Xcode from an unofficial source could be affected, as there is a chance their products are not totally above board. XcodeGhost could also affect developers creating enterprise apps. These are apps made by companies specifically for their own employees' devices, so they don't have to go through any sort of Apple security check. However, \"that's a pretty obscure attack,\" Charlie Miller, a security researcher at Uber who got his own malicious software onto the App Store in 2011, tells WIRED in a phone interview.\n\nHow Severe Is This?\n\nThe malware in the App Store itself is not concerning, but there's a broader issue here: the way in which it got past Apple's screening process in the first place.\n\n\"You might completely trust the app developer, and that developer might be completely trustworthy, but this is a case where the app wasn't,\" Miller said. That, and the fact that software made from a tampered version of Xcode found its way onto the App Store, should give developers pause.\n\nApple did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nBut what about consumers, and the people who downloaded the malicious apps? They should be only slightly concerned. \"I wouldn't worry too much,\" Miller says. The apps that did get through didn't seem to do any really nasty stuff. \"If you made it really, obviously bad, probably [Apple] would catch it,\" Miller says.\n\nThe bottom line for customers is, if you've downloaded one of these dodgy apps, delete it, and keep up with reports of other ones slipping through. What should developers do to protect their own apps and their customers?\n\n\"The moral of the story is: don't download random crap from Chinese sites,\" Miller says.\n\nGo Back to Top.

The piece is powerful and moving, a brave act on behalf of the women willing to tell their stories directly and an important piece of interactive journalism highlighting a culture of silence around rape. Unfortunately, unless you read it last night, you can't currently access the report on NYMag.com because the site is down, presumably as a result of a DDoS attack, according to a report by The Daily Dot. A Twitter user by the name of Vikingdom2016 has taken credit for the assault.\n\nThough Vikingdom2016 reportedly told The Daily Dot that the attack had nothing to do with the Cosby story and was done because he \"hates New York,\" it reeks of victim silencing. For 35 women to come out and accuse one of the entertainment industry's most powerful men of repeated sexual abuse is an act of defiance against a history of systemic silencing. Whether the alleged DDoS attacker knew it, by taking the story offline he is following in a grand tradition of keeping women's stories from being heard -- a tradition the story itself is trying to break.\n\nOn a brighter note, you can still read a cached version of the story while the site is down.\n\nThanks to the Wayback Machine you can still read the @NYMag cover story while the site's down. http://t.co/iZLaLCRfeQ (ht @elongreen)\n\n-- Sarah Weinman (@sarahw) July 27, 2015\n\nGo Back to Top.

Though Google was alerted of the problem in April and has created a patch to fix it, lead researcher Joshua Drake told Forbes that he believes phone manufacturers and carriers have not all rolled the fix out yet, so you may be at risk.\n\nThe What:\n\nIt's dubbed \"Stagefright.\" All a hacker would have to do to gain access to your device is send you a text message containing a malware-infected media attachment. The worst part? You don't even have to open the text or view the media in some cases. Drake noted that the remote MMS attack makes use of six critical vulnerabilities in Android operating systems 2.2 or later. Depending on the chat client you use, you may not even see the text message before it infects you -- for instance, if you use Hangouts, the app will decipher the code before you ever get a notification of the text.\n\nThe Who:\n\nDrake estimates that 950 million people use Android devices that could be at risk.\n\nHow Serious:\n\nThe researchers who found the flaws told NPR that they do not believe it is yet in use in the wild. Still, it is potentially the largest flaw ever uncovered in Android. The good news is that Google has a fix. The bad news is that Google can't send it to most directly -- it needs manufacturers and carriers to push the patch out to you. As of writing, it is unclear which devices are still at risk.\n\n\"All devices should be assumed to be vulnerable,\" Drake told Forbes.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Skip To: Start of Article.", "If Apple gives in to the FBI and creates backdoor access to a device's contents, the backdoor is likely to get into the hands of the people committing crimes and spreading terror.\n\nApple is dominating the news, without a new product in sight.\n\nIn this case, as you have probably read or seen, Apple is tussling with the FBI over an iPhone used by one of the murderers in last year's San Bernardino shootings.\n\nBriefly, the situation is this: The FBI wants to access the information on an iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a phone supplied by his employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health.\n\nThe phone is protected by a pass code, as well as the setting that erases the device's contents after 10 attempts. To get in, the FBI wants Apple to create a modified version of iOS that will update the existing operating system and remove the automatic erasure. Then, investigators could \"brute-force\" the device by trying millions of number combinations.\n\nApple is refusing, for good reason. The FBI claims that this is a one-time-only request, but the agency is either unbelievably naive (doubtful) or being disingenuous about its motives. Here's why: Creating that compromised version of iOS can't possibly be limited to this one instance, and the consequences of making it are dire.\n\nI'm not being hyperbolic. If such a version were to exist, it would mean that the iPhone's built-in encryption can be defeated. It would also set a precedent that would open the door to courts demanding Apple do the same in other cases. (The FBI has since acknowledged that's a possibility.)\n\nBut wait, that sounds good, right? We want to defeat terrorists and catch criminals and keep people safe. Unfortunately, this solution makes people less safe, because once this type of backdoor exists, it's likely to get into the hands of the people committing crimes and spreading terror.\n\nAccording to forensic scientist Jonathan Zdziarski, making any evidence gleaned from this type of search stand up in court automatically requires multiple copies of the exploit to be shared -- for validation, for review by prosecutors and defendants, and more. Now imagine the value of being able to break into anyone's iOS device worldwide. Criminals (and governments) would certainly tempt someone in that chain of dissemination to make a copy.\n\nAnd when it's in the wild, no iOS device would be safe: yours, lawmakers (the President gets intelligence briefings on an iPad), CEOs (opening up all sorts of potential industrial secrets) and anyone with private information.\n\nAnd it's not just iOS. Setting this precedent would mean the FBI or other agencies could compel Google and other manufacturers to expose hundreds of millions of devices. And if the United States can do it, you had better believe China, Russia and other nations will, too.\n\nMy colleague Rich Mogull, in one of the most cogent takes on this situation, wrote, \"(A)sk yourself, do we have a right to security? To secure devices, communications and services? Devices secure from criminals, foreign governments and yes, even our own? And by extension, do we have a right to privacy? Because privacy without security is impossible.\"\n\nRight now, Apple and the FBI are moving into the legal phase of this argument. It's nearly guaranteed that an upcoming version of iOS will make even this workaround that the government is asking for in this case impossible to perform in the future.\n\nSo, from a practical standpoint, what can you do to maintain the security of your own personal information?\n\nFirst, if you're not using a pass code on your iOS device, set one up now. The pass code activates encryption of data on the phone. If your pass code is four numbers (the previous default), change it to a six-digit or alphanumeric pass code: Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (or just Passcode on devices without Touch ID) > Change Passcode. After you enter your existing code, tap the Passcode Options link and change the type.\n\nNext, save sensitive information in a secure app such as 1Password. The days of keeping passwords in Notes or your Address Book are over. (That said, the next version of iOS will allow individual notes in the Notes app to be secured by pass code.)\n\nIf you're especially concerned, turn off iCloud backups and back up your device's data to a computer using iTunes; there you'll have an option to encrypt local backups. Currently, contents of iCloud backups are not encrypted, and Apple will share that information when subpoenaed to do so.\n\nNone of these actions makes you a terrorist sympathizer, because, honestly, terrorism is low on the list of threats to everyday people. Someone stealing your iPhone, breaking into it, and accessing your bank accounts and online accounts is more likely, and even that is a remote possibility compared with having your bank card numbers stolen from a big retailer that doesn't properly secure its own data.\n\nI'm hopeful that a sensible resolution comes out of this, and it's good that people who don't follow technology are being exposed to this issue.\n\nWhether on phones, wearables or \"smart home\" devices, encryption and security are absolutely vital, and those technologies are coming fast. Undermining security in one instance undermines it for everyone.", "Comedy Central's The Daily Show thinks the government is going about this privacy battle with Apple all wrong. Instead of going through court orders and CEO Tim Cook, why not just ask Siri?\n\nIn a clip from last night's show, a government agent takes the digital assistant to a black site to shake it down for the info investigators want. And if asking doesn't work, it might be time for a bit of \"enhanced interrogation.\"\n\nAfter giving the interrogator the sort of wrong answers we've all gotten at one time or another by offering directions to opticians who sell contact lenses instead of coughing up the phone's contacts, the usually friendly robot stops pretending to play along.\n\n\"Sorry, I didn't understand the question,\" Siri replies to one inquiry.\n\n\"Tell ... me ... what ... you're ...\" the agent says, speaking slowly and clearly.\n\n\"I heard you,\" Siri says, interrupting. \"I just don't speak Bitch.\"\n\nIt escalates hilariously from there.\n\nThe FBI has asked Apple for assistance in accessing the data on San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook's iPhone 5c as part of its investigation into last December's terror attack. Apple has fought back, claiming that while it condemns acts of terror and sympathizes with the victims, building the software that the government is requesting will compromise the security of hundreds of millions of iPhones.\n\nCook described the so-called \"GovtOS\" as \"the software equivalent of cancer\" during an interview with ABC News this week.", "Facebook rolled out a platform for quick, immersive ads with the potential to become a tempting rival to television commercials.\n\nThe leading social network made Canvas available globally as a free tool marketers can use to turn smartphone or tablet ads into \"experiences\" mixing videos, photos, text and \"call-to-action\" buttons.\n\nMobile ads built with Canvas entice people to scroll through a cascade of full-screen images, swiping along carousels or tapping at points to trigger videos or dive deeply into topics along the way.\n\n\"People love these ads,\" Facebook product lead Paresh Rajwat said of early tests of Canvas.\n\n\"They interact with these ads; Like them; comment on them; share them. We see people spending over 30 seconds in these experiences.\"\n\nAltimeter principal analyst Charlene Li said, who attended the Facebook unveiling, said the new program \"is truly linear storytelling.\"\n\n\"Finally, we have an ad unit that can compete with a 30-second television ad,\" she said.\n\nThe analyst expected Canvas ads to bite into the multibillion-dollar television ad business, especially if the technology begins to personalize messages to individuals at Facebook.\n\n\"I do think this will start pulling from television,\" Li said.\n\n\"The killer part will be when you can customise these ads for each person.\"\n\nShe noted that given what Facebook knows about its members, the potential to personalise Canvas ads is strong.\n\nAds created using Canvas will be served up the same as other ads at the social network, and will cost the same to advertisers, according to Rajwat.\n\nCanvas ads are designed to work on mobile devices powered by Apple or Android software.\n\nTom Brown of the creative shop at California-based Facebook likened making Canvas ads to working with Lego blocks, with components like photos, video and text easily \"stacked\" to simplify making immersive ads. -- AFP Relaxnews", "Congresswoman cites 'dangerous precedent' from court order forcing tech company to write access programming / free articles read. Subscribe for unlimited access\n\nRead FAQ\n\nA ranking member of the U.S. Congressional Communications and Technology Subcommittee said she supports tech company Apple's refusal to unlock an iPhone owned by a shooter in the San Bernardino killings.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo, D-Menlo Park, said in a statement on Friday, Feb. 26, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation overreached when it went to court to force Apple to unlock the phone owned by deceased killer Syed Rizwan Farook.\n\nThe iPhone, which investigators found in Farook's car, according to news reports, is the property of his employer, the San Bernardino County Health Department, which consented to the FBI search of the phone.\n\nBut the FBI reset the phone's iCloud password, and it has been unable to unlock the phone. If the wrong password is entered 10 times, the phone's data may become scrambled, the agency has said.\n\nThe FBI sought Apple's help to unlock the phone, but Apple would have to create a new program to do so, the company has said, and it has refused to do so, citing grave future privacy-violation concerns for all Apple devices.\n\nA writ sought by the FBI from a California district court orders Apple to create a program that would give the iPhone a \"backdoor\" so that the data can be retrieved. But Apple strongly objects to the court order.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said in a statement that \"the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create.\"\n\nEshoo agreed.\n\n\"As a veteran of the House Intelligence Committee, I've seen first-hand the heavy damage that occurs when big government exceeds the limits set by law,\" she wrote in the statement. \"The trust of the American people has been severely diminished by many indefensible undertakings, including Cisco routers being intercepted and bugged by our government before being shipped; the allegations that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone and those of other world leaders were being tapped; and the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as it was investigating controversial detention and interrogation programs.\n\n\"What Congress would not legislate, the FBI is now seeking to accomplish through the courts,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe FBI's request sounds simple and reasonable, but the implications of this case extend beyond any one company or device, Eshoo said.\n\n\"The FBI has gone to court to force a private company to create a system solely for the purpose of the federal government to use whenever and however it wishes. This came about after the government missed a key opportunity to back-up and potentially recover information from the device by resetting the iCloud password in the days following the shooting,\" she said. \"This is a stunning overreach of the FBI to demand that a private company create a new operating system with a 'swinging door' that the federal government can enter and exit without any rules whatsoever, whenever they wish.\n\n\"The access being sought by the government is a national security issue with global implications. If forced to comply with the Court's order, Apple would not just be unlocking one phone. It would in essence be ordered to also unlock a world where our personal information is vulnerable to attacks by terrorist organizations, rogue nations and others seeking to cause the U.S. harm and instill fear,\" she continues.\n\nCongress has determined that backdoors endanger the country because they weaken security. Efforts to circumvent code that protects sensitive information on one device creates a dangerous precedent for future seizure of information and a pathway for unauthorized access of that information by hackers, foreign governments and terrorists, she added.\n\nIn an interesting twist, she quoted one of the country's most notably conservative Constitutional scholars, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn a 1987 case, Arizona vs. Hicks, Scalia wrote for the court's majority: \"But there is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.\"\n\nEshoo acknowledged the importance of law enforcement, but mass access to surveillance by the federal government is not the answer, Eshoo said.\n\n\"Our Constitution calls on us to protect and defend against enemies both foreign and domestic. It also provides for the protection of the citizenry from the abuses of its own government,\" she said.\n\nThis story contains 735 words.\n\nHave a paid subscription/membership?

Apple is expected to announce a 4-inch iPhone, a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and new Apple Watch bands.\n\nApple Insider reported that \"Apple employees have been asked to keep the days around March 22 free, presumably for an upcoming event.\"\n\nOriginally, this event was rumored to happen a week earlier on March 15 with new products hitting store shelves that Friday, March 18. If Apple is delaying the announcement event, it's likely that shipments will also be pushed back to sometime around Friday, March 25.\n\nCoincidentally, March 22 is also the date of Apple's federal court hearing against the FBI, which issued a court order to unlock an iPhone belonging to the gunman of the San Bernardino shooting in December. On Thursday, Apple officially responded to the court order with a motion to vacate, claiming that compelling Apple to assist the FBI is a violation of the company's constitutional rights. The hearing will take place in Riverside, California.\n\nWhy this matters: If the rumors are true and Apple's media event is slated for March 22 and not March 15, it will be a very busy day for Tim Cook and company. After the recent legal maelstrom, it's not inconceivable to think that Apple's executive team really needs that extra week to get these products in front of people. But pushing it back to the exact same day as one of the most pivotal points in this case seems haphazard.\n\nIf it's been done intentionally, this could be an interesting strategy by Apple to try to divert attention away from the court hearing. But considering how much Apple's battle with the FBI has dominated the news cycle in the last few days, it's more likely that the court hearing will divert attention from the new product announcements. And we don't think Apple would ever do anything to divert attention away from that. Perhaps the reason why Apple employees were asked to keep the days around March 22 free is simply because of the hearing.", "Samsung was handed a big win in its second major patent infringement fight against Apple on Friday when the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a US$119.6 million damages ruling. A lower court ruling said Samsung's mobile devices infringed on Apple's quick links, slide-to-unlock, and autocorrect patents -- a ruling the Appeals Court felt was off base.\n\nAppeals Court overturns Apple's win in second Samsung patent infringement case\n\nThe Appeals Court found Samsung wasn't infringing on the quick links patent, and declared the slide-to-unlock and autocorrect patents invalid, according to Reuters. The patents in question included:\n\n5,946,647 - System and method for performing an action on a structure in computer-generated data 8,046,721 - Unlocking a device by performing gestures on an unlock image 8,074,172 - Method, system, and graphical user interface for providing word recommendations\n\nThis was the second big U.S. infringement case between the two companies. A Federal jury ruled in 2014 mostly in Apple's favor and awarded the iPhone and iPad maker $119.6 million in damages for Samsung's infringement on multiple patents. The same jury found that Apple infringed on one of Samsung's patents and awarded the electronics maker $158,400 in damages.\n\nThis case was similar to a 2012 patent infringement trial where a jury found Samsung infringed on a long list of Apple's patents and that Apple didn't infringe on any of Samsung's. Apple was awarded $1.1 billion in damages, but that was later lowered to $980 million.\n\nSamsung held out on paying Apple but finally agreed to hand over $548.2 million last December on the condition it gets that back, plus interest, should the courts overturn the original ruling. Samsung is currently waiting to see if the U.S. Supreme Court will hear its appeal.\n\nSamsung's tactics have rendered Apple's court room wins as mostly symbolic because it hasn't been blocked from selling devices ruled as infringing. Apple did finally win a permanent injunction in January blocking Samsung from selling specific mobile devices in the U.S, but that will have little impact because most of those aren't available any more.\n\nThat injunction was part of the case where Samsung just won its appeal, and now that two of the patents in that case have been ruled invalid it has even less value. Apple's consolation is that it did win the injunction, which is something it might be able to note in future patent infringement cases.\n\nIn the end it looks like Samsung's long time legal tactics will prevail: drag the litigation out as long as possible so any wins its opponents get are hollow, and don't worry about those silly patents.

Judge Orenstein, in denying the government's motion, concluded that the All Writs Act (AWA) does not compel Apple to assist the government with unlocking the phone of a convicted drug dealer in the hopes of finding other co-conspirators.\n\nAccording to Judge Orenstein's ruling:\n\n\"I conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the government has failed to establish either that the AWA permits the relief it seeks or that, even if such an order is authorized, the discretionary factors I must consider weigh in favor of granting the motion.\"\n\nSpecifically, Judge Orenstein considered three factors in determining whether the AWA should apply in this case:\n\nthe closeness of Apple's relationship to the underlying criminal conduct and government investigation, the burden the requested order would impose on Apple, and the necessity of imposing such a burden on Apple.\n\nHis conclusion was that \"none of those factors justifies imposing on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will.\"\n\nThe case in question involves a suspected New York-based drug dealer named Jun Feng, who was arrested in 2014 and later convicted.

Please check back for updates.", "After spending a decade in India, TBWA still finds itself among agencies which are looking to find a firm footing in the country. But now, with a new India CEO -- Govind Pandey -- and new solutions platforms called Disruption and Disruption Live, the agency is geared up to finally make its mark in the Indian market. BrandWagon's Shinmin Bali speaks to Philip Brett of TBWA Asia about plans for India and where the focus of the agency lies. Excerpts:\n\nTBWA chooses to position itself as a disruptive agency. Do you see advertising and disruption as one and the same thing?\n\nThere are disruptive agencies but we're the disruption agency. It is something that has defined TBWA forever. Jean-Marie Dru developed the idea of disruption some 25-30 years ago. In the current language, the best way to explain it is that it is our operating system. It is a tool that we use externally according to a client's plan.\n\nWe're not an agency that believes in maintaining the status quo. Look at our founding clients, like Apple... they are brands that have challenged the norm. So, we've always lived with that.\n\nDisruption looks at the convention of a marketplace. Everything we do as people, brands or companies, is driven by conventions. There are unwritten rules of life which you follow without challenging. What disruption tries to do is to identify which one of those conventions needs to be challenged. Disruption is figuring out how to reach your audiences in a different way, and that doesn't always mean a 30-second TV spot. It could be a 30-minute movie.\n\nBut would you say that disruption doesn't necessarily equal digital?\n\nIt can be anything. For example, if you take sports brands that talk about performance, there are Nike and Adidas which claim what you wear is what makes you an athlete. If you add disruption in that category, the message will change to: it isn't what you wear but what you are on the inside that makes you a better athlete. Going ahead with this, the message can then be taken across different directions but it doesn't always have to mean communication through a TV commercial.\n\nWhen you look at conventions, sometimes it can be a packaging problem; it could be that the advertising is wrong or the target audience is wrong. When you have found the key convention, what you need to do is challenge it and when you do that it will lead you to some form of disruption.\n\nTBWA then is open to developing brands via solutions in packaging, design, etc, and not just through advertising. Correct?\n\nWhat we have always tried to do is develop great brand ideas and they could be around product, packaging, positioning, audience or communication; we are not a TV agency.\n\nGovind Pandey joined recently. What are the changes we can look forward to?\n\nWe have a goal instead of a prescribed series of outcomes. We want this office to become a genuine TBWA India office, a quintessentially India company. We are not the network that shapes from the top down. Govind will set the template for that. A lot will come down to him choosing the path for the agency.\n\nWhat we don't want is to be big. That might be a side benefit one day. Big has never been at the core of what we do. In a market like India, the goal would be for every client and every employee to know why they work with or for TBWA. If they know that, then everything is working. If we are living up to our promise of delivering disruption, we are delivering an environment for great talent. From there on, size and performance will follow.\n\nJob number one is to make sure that we continue to look after our existing clients of whom there are some pretty important brands in the Indian context. A lot of agencies pull the growth lever and the clients start to leave. The order should be client retention, client focus and then growth. What Govind will spend time on is get his team set, get the product and people aligned, cater to current clients and only then focus on new business. Govind hasn't come into this job to create a mini McCann. The TBWA brand gives him an opportunity to be something different in this market.\n\nTBWA's global image is far edgier than its Indian counterpart. What learnings can be applied here?", "NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department cannot force Apple to provide the FBI with access to locked iPhone data in a routine Brooklyn drug case, a federal judge ruled Monday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein's written decision gives support to the company's position in its fight against a California judge's order that it create specialized software to help the FBI hack into an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism investigation.\n\nApple on Thursday formally objected to the order in a brief filed with the court, accusing the federal government of seeking \"dangerous power\" through the courts and of trampling on the company's constitutional rights.\n\nThe San Bernardino County-owned iPhone 5C was used by Syed Farook, who was a health inspector. He and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people during a Dec. 2 attack at a county holiday party that was at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group. The couple died later in a gun battle with police.\n\nApple's opposition to the government's tactics has evoked a national debate over digital privacy rights and national security.\n\nOrenstein concluded that Apple is not obligated to assist government investigators against its will and noted that Congress has not adopted legislation that would achieve the result sought by the government. Orenstein's ruling -- while not considered binding or precedent setting for the California case -- will likely still have influence on the arguments put forth before Judge Sheri Pym at a hearing next month. The New York case is far less onerous or invasive for Apple and its technology; the extraction technique exists for that older operating system, and it's been used before to assist investigators.\n\nIn California, Pym ordered investigators to create specialized software -- which since late 2014 doesn't exist for newer phones -- to help the FBI bypass security protocols to test random passcode combinations in rapid sequence.\n\nOrenstein said he was offering no opinion on whether in the instance of this case or others, \"the government's legitimate interest in ensuring that no door is too strong to resist lawful entry should prevail against the equally legitimate societal interests arrayed against it here.\"\n\nHe said the interests at stake go beyond expectations of privacy and include the commercial interest in conducting business free of potentially harmful government intrusion and the \"far more fundamental and universal interest ... in shielding sensitive electronically stored data from the myriad harms, great and small, that unauthorized access and misuse can cause.\"\n\n\"How best to balance those interests is a matter of critical importance to our society, and the need for an answer becomes more pressing daily, as the tide of technological advance flows ever farther past the boundaries of what seemed possible even a few decades ago,\" Orenstein wrote. \"But that debate must happen today, and it must take place among legislators who are equipped to consider the technological and cultural realities of a world their predecessors could not begin to conceive.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement that it's disappointed in the ruling and plans to appeal in coming days. It said Apple had previously agreed many times prior to assist the government and \"only changed course when the government's application for assistance was made public by the court.\"\n\nA senior Apple executive said the company policy has been to produce information to the government when there is a lawful order to do so, but that in New York the judge never issued the order, and instead asked attorneys to file briefs addressing the constitutionality of the request for Apple to bypass its security protocols under the 1789 All Writs Act. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a pending legal matter.\n\nOrenstein invited Apple in October to challenge the government's use of the catchall law to compel it to help law enforcement recover iPhone data in criminal cases, noting that another law on the books already covered the issue.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based computer maker did, saying in court papers that extracting information from an iPhone \"could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand.\"\n\nIt followed up by declining to cooperate in a dozen more instances in four states involving government requests to aid criminal probes by retrieving data from individual iPhones.\n\nIn ruling, Orenstein wrote: \"I believe Apple has the better argument\" because the other law covering wiretaps for telecom companies \"explicitly absolves a company like Apple of any responsibility to provide the assistance the government seeks here.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors say Apple has stopped short of challenging court orders judicially, except in the cases before Orenstein and the California jurist who ruled about the San Bernardino shooter's phone.\n\n\"Ultimately, the question to be answered in this matter, and in others like it across the country, is not whether the government should be able to force Apple to help it unlock a specific device; it is instead whether the All Writs Act resolves that issue and many others like it yet to come,\" Orenstein wrote. \"For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that it does not.\"", "A magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court in New York has handed Apple a legal victory in a Brooklyn drug case where federal investigators asked for help getting into a locked iPhone.\n\nThough the ruling isn't precedent-setting or binding to other courts, it hits on a similar over-arching theme of governments' access to encrypted data, as The Washington Post reports:\n\nNPR's Joel Rose previously outlined the premise of this Brooklyn case, which was predating the legal clash over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters:\n\nThat order was based on the same law as the San Bernardino court order compelling Apple's help in unlocking the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook before the Dec. 2 attack, in which he and his wife killed 14 people.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the All Writs Act has been often used to compel companies, including Apple, to help with investigations. But, as Rose reports, something unusual happened in the Brooklyn drug case:\n\nThe Justice Department says Apple had previously complied with at least 70 All Writs Act orders without objection, and the Brooklyn case was the first, in which Apple challenged such an order in court.\n\nIn the Monday ruling, Judge James Orenstein wrote:\n\nThe Justice Department says it plans to appeal the case:\n\nFBI Director James Comey and Apple's General Counsel Bruce Sewell are both slated to testify at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on encryption on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. attorneys are due to respond to Apple's filing in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by March 10, and a hearing has been scheduled there for March 22.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists. Two albums that are very popular right now were released on Tidal, a streaming service owned by a group of artists headed by Jay-Z. One of those albums is near the top of the charts right now. The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center. The album that has a lot of critics and fans wrapped up right now is West's The Life of Pablo. To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones. Exclusive streaming deals have their own ramifications.\n\nTake for example Drake's inescapable \"Hotline Bling.\" Last fall, when the video for \"Hotline Bling\" was released, Drake was saying how much he was thirsting for a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He wrote about his desire very publicly.\n\nDrake's team gave the video to Apple Music as an exclusive -- and the strategy backfired, at least in terms of getting him to his goal of being No. 1. Apple doesn't report its video streams to Nielsen Music, so there was no chance of the song making the top spot as long as it was an Apple exclusive.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Samsung has been in talks from time to time about buying Tidal -- and sources were telling The New York Post this weekend that those talks have resumed in earnest.", "WASHINGTON Feb 29 U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday that she hopes Apple Inc. will still comply with the court order by a federal judge in California to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Lynch also weighed in on the Hillary Clinton email investigation, national security and the possibility that she could be nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"I haven't had those conversations. I'm very happy with my job,\" Lynch said on the possibility of receiving a Supreme Court nomination. (Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Chris Reese)", "The least helpful question in assessing a new piece of tech is \"How do you like it?\" Why? Because sometimes, users have contradictory feelings about their devices - for example, something that meets a need in your daily life can still be exasperating to use.\n\nSo how would I answer the unhelpful question, \"Hey, Android Guy, how do you like your new Microsoft Surface Pro 4?\"\n\nOn the one hand, I love it. My skepticism that the Surface could perform as the \"tablet that can replace your laptop,\" as Microsoft loves to proclaim, has mostly subsided.\n\nI say mostly because there are still a few things that occasionally drive me nuts. Some of these things rest with the software, as Windows 10 is still wonky in a few places compared to the relatively smooth OS X.

I am on my third Surface after Microsoft swapped out the first two since they had various hardware issues.\n\nStill, my mixed experience might be able to help other people assess their planned tech purchases - or see whether there's something they can do to improve how they're using their existing tech. Here's how my Surface Pro 4 adventure has gone so far.\n\nSometimes you really need a pen to do your work\n\nOne of the reasons I was drawn to the Surface was my long-time affinity for the idea of pen input. It goes back to the Middle Ages of computing, before everyone had a smartphone and touch interfaces were a far-off dream. In the early 200s I had a Thinkpad Windows XP Tablet PC Edition.\n\nI've floated away from my pen-based computing habit in the past few years. My need to go with a laptop as my primary computer given the fact I travel frequently and like to write on the go often drew me to a MacBook. I'm still relatively happy with that decision, especially in how well things like iMessage and Continuity work together (I use an iPhone for testing along with my Nexus 6P).\n\nBut when it comes to large projects, research, or editing there's a lot of value in the pen input. If you're someone who reads a lot of text during the day and has to sometimes dissect boring analyst reports, the ability to highlight items and scribble notes is a serious game changer. The Surface's pen and tablet combination really drives home how easy and elegant the user experience is when you have a well-deployed stylus and software combo. This has become critical to my workflow and I highly recommend it if you're someone who requires doodling, highlighting or non-linear typing in your work or play.\n\nThe tablet takes on typing, does better than expected\n\nThe largest disincentive for those who are thinking whether or not to go with a Surface is the typing experience. Maybe it's because I went in with pretty low expectations, but I find that the newest type cover works really well. The trackpad is fluid, and Windows 10 has good built-in controls for helping you to tweak how fast or slow the mouse response is.\n\nHowever, coming from a MacBook Pro it's not quite there. The built-in gestures are nice, but a three-finger swipe to the side limits you to the two most-recent applications. Instead, with OS X you can put all your apps in full-screen mode and swipe amongst all of them. It's a small item that feels like it's missing when moving from the MacBook to the Surface.\n\nThe Windows split-screen mode is nice, and is better implemented than Apple's OS. However, even some of Microsoft's apps are weird in how they scrunch all the commands together, making this mode far more effective on a larger, external monitor than on the Surface's 12.3-inch screen.\n\nLet's hear it for Microsoft's customer support\n\nSay this for Microsoft's customer support - they're happy to swap out your device if there are too many problems. My first unit had a weird bug that wouldn't allow it to charge fully. There were also multiple fatal errors discovered when running a diagnostic test with the command prompt.\n\nDevice number two, unfortunately, was worse. It would often not come to life from standby. The backlit keyboard would come to life, but the screen was blank. A hard reset was required to resurrect it.\n\nThe third time was, well, you know how that saying goes. I still experience some of the charging issue, but by and large I haven't experienced any other major problems. A recent firmware update may have also helped, and I'm eager to just get on and use the Surface without major hassles. All hardware makers have problems, but there have been a lot of issues with the current generation of the Surface line, which is surprising for what's being marketed as a high-end device.\n\nDealing with residual Windows wonkiness\n\nWindows 10 is an excellent upgrade over Windows 8.1. The tile nonsense has been relegated to a tablet mode, where it works well when you want to use the Surface as just, well, a tablet.\n\nWhere the new OS also shines with this device is how well it takes advantage of both touch and pen input. The gestures and responsiveness make you want to touch the screen, even when just the trackpad would do the job.\n\nThe verdict: I've decided to see other computers\n\nAlthough I've come to really like and enjoy using the Surface Pro 4. sometimes I'm running back to the MacBook when the trackpad drives me batty or I miss being able to text fluidly right on the computer. It's the little glitches in workflow that add up.\n\nYet there are other times that I go to touch the screen on my Macbook or reach for a pen that isn't there. Marking up OneNote files or scribbling out an edit in a Word document is something that can't be replicated in other ways.\n\nThe Surface gets a lot right: the pen experience, the interface, the customer service. But there are things it doesn't quite nail. Before, when users were locked into a computing model that depended on one person, one computer, one operating system, it might have been expedient to work with or around the irritation. But these days, users are juggling multiple OSes across multiple devices. They unconsciously or consciously compare and contrast the experiences, and they expect a lot.\n\nThe Surface is great in a lot of ways, but it came into a world where a lot of other computing devices are great in other ways. The trick now is to see whether it can add to its great points in subsequent software releases.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists. Two albums that are very popular right now were released on Tidal, a streaming service owned by a group of artists headed by Jay-Z. One of those albums is near the top of the charts right now. The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center. The album that has a lot of critics and fans wrapped up right now is West's The Life of Pablo. To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones. Exclusive streaming deals have their own ramifications.\n\nTake for example Drake's inescapable \"Hotline Bling.\" Last fall, when the video for \"Hotline Bling\" was released, Drake was saying how much he was thirsting for a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He wrote about his desire very publicly.\n\nDrake's team gave the video to Apple Music as an exclusive -- and the strategy backfired, at least in terms of getting him to his goal of being No. 1. Apple doesn't report its video streams to Nielsen Music, so there was no chance of the song making the top spot as long as it was an Apple exclusive.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Samsung has been in talks from time to time about buying Tidal -- and sources were telling The New York Post this weekend that those talks have resumed in earnest.", "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Justice Department cannot force Apple to provide the FBI with access to a locked iPhone data in a routine Brooklyn drug case, a magistrate judge ruled Monday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein's written decision gives support to the company's position in its fight against a California judge's order that it create specialized software to help the FBI hack into an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism investigation. Apple's filing to oppose the order by Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym in California is due by Friday.\n\nThe San Bernardino County-owned iPhone 5C was used by Syed Farook, who was a health inspector. He and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people during a Dec. 2 attack that was at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group.\n\nApple's opposition to the government's tactics have evoked a national debate over digital privacy rights and national security.\n\nOrenstein concluded that Apple is not obligated to assist government investigators against its will and noted that Congress has not adopted legislation that would achieve the result sought by the government.\n\n\"How best to balance those interests is a matter of critical importance to our society, and the need for an answer becomes more pressing daily, as the tide of technological advance flows ever farther past the boundaries of what seemed possible even a few decades ago,\" Orenstein wrote. \"But that debate must happen today, and it must take place among legislators who are equipped to consider the technological and cultural realities of a world their predecessors could not begin to conceive.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said they were disappointed in the ruling and planned to appeal in the coming days. Apple and their attorneys said they were reading opinion and will comment later.\n\nIn October, Orenstein invited Apple to challenge the government's use of a 227-year-old law to compel Apple to help it recover iPhone data in criminal cases.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based computer maker did, saying in court papers that extracting information from an iPhone \"could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand.\"\n\nIt followed up by declining to cooperate in a dozen more instances in four states involving government requests to aid criminal probes by retrieving data from individual iPhones.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Apple has stopped short of challenging court orders judicially, except in the cases before Orenstein and the California jurist who ruled about the San Bernardino shooter's phone.\n\n\"Ultimately, the question to be answered in this matter, and in others like it across the country, is not whether the government should be able to force Apple to help it unlock a specific device; it is instead whether the All Writs Act resolves that issue and many others like it yet to come,\" Orenstein wrote. \"For the reasons set forth above, I conclude that it does not.\"", "Apple's showdown with the FBI over an alleged San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone has drawn heavy scrutiny lately, but the company has also been involved in a similar and ongoing legal battle over a different iPhone in law enforcement's custody in New York. On Monday, Judge James Orenstein ruled in favor of Apple.\n\nWhile the case is distinct from the San Bernardino case, there are parallels. In the NY case, the government demanded that Apple disable the security lock on an iPhone 5s running iOS 7. In that case, as in San Bernardino, the government argued that the All Writs Act of 1789, a law that's as broadly open to interpretation as its age might suggest, granted it the authority to make such a request.\n\nJudge Orenstein, in this ruling, disagrees. Of the All Writs application, he writes that \"the government posits a reading...so expansive -- and in particular, in such tension with the doctrine of separation of powers -- as to cast doubt on the AWA's constitutionality if adopted.\"\n\nNoting that Apple has been ordered under the authority of the All Writs Act to bypass the security of not one but 12 total devices, Orenstein rejects the argument that the All Writs act can be used as a \"gap filler\" that allows law enforcement to plug in powers that Congress has not yet granted or explicitly denied.\n\n\"In particular, unlike the government, Apple contends that a court order that accomplishes something Congress has considered but declined to adopt -- albeit without explicitly or implicitly prohibiting it -- is not agreeable to the usages and principles of law,\" writes Orenstein, in reference to Apple's argument that the Obama administration and Congress had previously passed on the opportunity to create laws around encryption. It's also another nudge to Congress that it may be time for those laws to exist.\n\nImportantly, Orenstein also draws a distinction between the case before him and a 1977 case involving New York Telephone under which the All Writs Act applied. That case, which first established that the AWA could be used to compel private companies to assist law enforcement, does not have much bearing here, according to the Orenstein ruling. Unlike New York Telephone, Orenstein notes, Apple is not a public company. It would do harm to its brand and its products if it complied with the order. And, importantly, it would be writing software outside of its normal line of business, whereas New York Telephone installed a device, known as a pen register, that it both already possessed and would feasibly install under the normal course of business.\n\nOrenstein is similarly dismissive of the government's other claims. \"The government essentially argues that having reaped the benefits of being an American company, it cannot claim to be burdened by being seen to assist the government,\" he writes. \"Such argument reflects poorly on a government that exists in part to safeguard the freedom of its citizens... to make autonomous choices about how best to balance societal and private interests in going about their lives and their businesses. The same argument could be used to condemn with equal force any citizen's chosen form of dissent.\"\n\nThat Orenstein ruled in favor of Apple is not surprising; the judge had indicated in October that he would not eagerly take the side of law enforcement. But the final result turns out to be a powerful refutation of arguments very similar to those on which the government has staked its case in San Bernardino. It's also notable that the San Bernardino case demands that Apple create a whole new operating system, which is an even greater demand for Apple than what law enforcement is pushing for in this NY case.\n\n\"If the California court has the same interpretation, then [Apple] will not be forced to aid in unlocking the iPhone,\" says Greg Boyd, an attorney who specializes in privacy and data security. \"Among other pillars in the opinion, Judge Orenstein relies on Congress's writing of the CALEA statute that explicitly forbids the type of interference requested in this and the California case. This case is also a reminder that the pending California case is not just about the phone in San Bernardino, but is in fact about accessing phones, whenever it is in the government's interest to do so.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine a bigger win for Apple, or a more clear playbook for how the company will continue to fight its legal battles going forward. Whether San Bernardino takes this as precedent remains to be seen.\n\nGo Back to Top.

I'm very happy with my job,\" Lynch repeated twice.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Chris Reese and Andrew Hay)", "Handing Apple a key legal win in its intensifying privacy showdown with the FBI, a federal judge in New York on Monday rejected the government's bid to force the Silicon Valley power to unlock an iPhone to aid investigators in a drug trafficking case.\n\nBolstering Apple's position in a similar, high-stakes legal battle in the San Bernardino County terror probe, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein concluded the government does not have the authority to force a company to crack its own security protections against its will, calling it \"an unreasonable burden\" on Apple.\n\nThe Brooklyn judge became the first in the nation to address the sticky legal conflict between Apple and the government over such demands, although the ruling does not settle the matter in the California case.\n\nIn a 50-page ruling, Orenstein noted the 18th Century law invoked by the government to seek the order did not envision the type of debate now unfolding in the courts and in the political arena pitting government's law enforcement and national security needs against the tech industry's privacy rights. He indicated Congress, not federal judges, should solve the conflict.\n\n\"How best to balance those interests is a matter of critical importance to our society, and the need for an answer becomes more pressing daily, as the tide of technological advance flows ever farther past the boundaries of what seemed possible even a few decades ago,\" Orenstein wrote. \"But that debate must happen today, and it must take place among legislators who are equipped to consider the technological and cultural realities of a world their predecessors could not begin to conceive.\"\n\nThe ruling is likely to provide legal fodder to Apple's side as the company and FBI square off in federal court in Riverside County over Apple's refusal to comply with an order requiring it to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino County shooters. A federal magistrate there is scheduled to hold a hearing in the case on March 22.\n\nWhile Apple is raising broader constitutional arguments in the California case and the technology involved is distinct, company officials said Monday that Orenstein's ruling could influence the San Bernardino legal battle.\n\n\"It's directly on point,\" said a senior Apple executive who asked not to be identified. \"This is the first time a court has looked specifically at the issue.\"\n\nJustice Department officials expressed disappointment in the ruling, indicating they plan to ask a district court judge -- which outranks a magistrate -- to reconsider. \"This phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\" a department spokesman said.\n\nApple, backed by the tech industry, argues that the FBI's demands threaten the privacy and security rights of millions of iPhone users around the world. The company recently disclosed in the Brooklyn case that it has already received at least a dozen FBI requests to unlock iPhones since last fall, and anticipates many more from the government if it loses in the courts.\n\nU.S. Justice Department officials have downplayed Apple's security arguments, contending the government is seeking technical help to aid in a crucial terrorism investigation that does not pose a wider threat to consumer privacy and digital security.\n\nOrenstein has been weighing the government's bid to force Apple to unlock the iPhone in the drug case since October. But the issue exploded into the public eye two weeks ago, when another magistrate judge in Riverside County ordered Apple to crack the security of the iPhone 5C of one of the San Bernardino County shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed after he and his wife gunned down 14 people in a terror attack.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym is now weighing the conflicting arguments of Apple and Justice Department lawyers. A number of tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, are expected to weigh in with arguments supporting Apple later this week.\n\nPym is not bound by Orenstein's decision, and her earlier order reached a different conclusion, requiring Apple to unlock the iPhone but giving the company an opportunity to lodge opposing legal arguments.\n\nIn addition, the rulings from both judges are expected to wind up in the federal appeals courts -- in fact, Apple has pledged to take its case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and FBI director James Comey said last week he expects the San Bernardino case to set precedent on the issue.\n\nBoth the New York and California cases center on whether the 1789 All Writs Act, a catch-all law that gives the courts power to order individuals or businesses to take action, provides the legal authority to compel Apple to create the tech needed to unlock an iPhone.\n\nOrenstein specifically found that old law, crafted in the time of parchment and ink, did not cover that power.\n\nThe New York case, however, involves an older operating system than the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, a key factor to Apple, which argues the judge in California is asking the company to create a tech method to hack the phone that currently does not exist.\n\nHoward Mintz covers legal affairs.

Apple have now released an apology for the recent error 53 problem and a corresponding update to fix it. The update is iOS 9.2.1 and it will allow you to restore your iPhone using iTunes on either a Windows PC or Mac. The code which caused the problem in the first place and disabled the phone, was apparently never intended to be released to the public.\n\nIf you do not have a Windows PC or an Apple Mac? Well...\n\nNow the other thing I wanted to talk about was the case in America where the FBI have asked Apple to develop a new version of iOS that will remove certain security features. This in turn will allow the FBI to unlock an iPhone recovered during their investigations of the San Bernadino case.\n\nUsually if you try to hack into an iPhone, after a certain number of failed attempts (10 I believe) the phone becomes locked, wiping the data.\n\nApple have released a statement explaining the request and their decision not to comply, and several well known big businesses have offered their support. You see while the FBI only want to use the new operating system (which doesn't exist yet) on a single iPhone, Apple's CEO Tim Cook goes on to explain that just by existing, it could be re-used and abused. It is not inconceivable that criminals could get hold of the tools and methods for unlocking all iPhones if the alternate version of iOS was created.\n\nScary thought huh?\n\nIt's not the first time something like this has threatened our own personal data security. The UK government itself wants to enact a bill that would ensure encrypted data could be decrypted upon request and handed over to government authorities. All in the name of anti terrorism legislation.\n\nThe common theme here is that governments have national interests, but their actions have international consequences. Big businesses are global, which means the services they provide are too. They are no longer bound by national borders. Similarly the internet is not bound by national borders and don't even think for one second that criminal organisations are bound by national borders.\n\nIf the FBI succeeds in compelling Apple to produce a less secure version of iOS, it affects everyone. If the UK government succeeds in pushing through their bill to decrypt information upon request, it affects everyone.\n\nWhat with that and the EU's right to be forgotten (which affects everyone), it's 1984 all over again. Thought police and censorship anyone?\n\nWe have all grown used to living in a surveillance society, with CCTV cameras, phone hacking scandals and neighbours peeking through their curtains.

So tread with caution.\n\nBut it suggests that Microsoft is gaining a lot of ground on Google in schools. Google's Chromebooks, which can be found for as low as $149, are super-lightweight laptops that run Chrome OS, basically a modified version of the Google Chrome browser.\n\nMicrosoft brags in its blog post that Windows' rising classroom popularity is due to the fact that it's available on a wide range of devices, from cheap sub-$200 laptops all the way up to the premium Surface Pro 4 tablet.\n\nThat means a wider availability than before of cheap laptops that also run a full, versatile version of Windows, versus the Chromebooks' limitations (which are entirely web-browser based). Plus, Microsoft says that Windows is easier for a school's IT team to manage than the competition.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft brags that Futuresource's data shows a 20% increase in Windows device shipments to grade schools over 2014. The devices tracked by the report includes laptops and tablets, but not desktop PCs.\n\nNotably, the number is inclusive of all versions of Windows: While many of those devices sold probably run the new Windows 10 operating system, it only came out in July of 2015. That means that many of those laptops and tablets were running Windows 8. It's an important point as Microsoft's march to a billion Windows 10 users continues.\n\nSchools and education are an intensely desirable market for the biggest tech companies in the world. In a world increasingly ruled by the Internet, there's a lot of money to be made selling devices directly to schools.

Cook also said Apple expects iPhone sales in the company's current, fiscal second quarter to dip somewhat from the 61.2 million iPhones sold a year ago.\n\nAs such, Apple might be using the March event to stoke the market early this year instead of waiting until September, as it historically has done, to unveil a new iPhone model. Apple has held such an event during September in each of the past three years, including last year, when Apple debuted the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.\n\nThe reported iPhone 5SE is said to have a 4-inch screen and be approximately the same size as the iPhone 5S. However, the new iPhone will reportedly run on either the A8 processor, which is currently used in the iPhone 6, or the A9 chip that the iPhone 6S uses.\n\nIf Apple does, indeed, hold an event March 21, it will start a very busy week for the company. Apple is supposed to be in court March 22 in a hearing related to its refusal to help the FBI hack into the iPhone 5C that belonged to one of the shooters in December's terrorist attack in San Bernardino.\n\n\"The iPhone is the product at greatest risk and the FBI problem gives them an opportunity to put it on a fast replacement cycle and make the problem go away,\" Enderle said.\n\nIt's also possible Apple might still replace March 21 with a different date for whatever event it has planned. Because of that, when putting Apple down on the calendar, it's best to keep that pencil, and its eraser, handy.", "Apple is rumored to unveil a new 9.7-inch iPad on March 21st, and while it may not pack as big a screen as the iPad Pro, it will be way better at taking photos and videos.\n\nRather than matching the iPad Pro camera, a new rumor claims Apple may give the new iPad the same sensors found in the iPhone 6s.\n\n\"Internal prototypes of the smaller model include a 12 megapixel rear camera comparable to the sensor in the iPhone 6s,\" 9to5Mac reports.\n\nBoth the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Pro have 8MP rear camera sensors.

Other rumored features include 4 speaker audio, A9X processor, Smart Connector with a Smart Keyboard, and the ability to doodle with Apple Pencil.\n\nFull details on the next iPad is scheduled to go down on March 21st when the company will also unveil a new 4-inch iPhone and some new Apple Watch bands.", "A New York magistrate judge has said that the government can't compel Apple to unlock an iPhone involved in a criminal investigation.\n\nIn a ruling filed today, Judge James Orenstein has said that he must \"reject the government's interpretation that the [All Writs Act] empowers a court to grant any relief not outright prohibited by law.\" This decision is the latest development in a months-long case that may serve as a precursor to the iPhone maker's larger confrontation with the FBI.\n\nThis is not the more public case involving San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook's device, but it's similar in many ways and may inform that battle. Now that one judge has ruled that the government can not use the All Writs Act to compel a company to act against its own wishes, it could establish a legal precedent that Apple can use in its own defense. This decision comes just one day before Apple and the FBI are set to appear in front of Congress to make their arguments.\n\nInvestigators were seeking the information contained on an iPhone 5s belonging to Jun Feng, who entered a guilty plea for drug and conspiracy charges back in October. Despite the conviction, the government still wants to get into the phone. Both Apple and prosecutors urged a decision on this matter.\n\nJudge Orenstein's interesting 50-page decision sides with Apple, saying that while he agrees with the government's assertion that the contents of the phone are still relevant despite the defendant's guilty plea,\n\nApple is not doing anything to keep law enforcement agents from conducting their investigation. Apple has not conspired with Feng to make the data on his device inaccessible.\n\n[. . .]\n\nIndeed, the government's complaint is precisely that Apple is doing nothing at all. If Feng had not engaged the passcode security on his device, or if the government had been able to secure an order compelling Feng to unlock the phone on pain of contempt sanctions, the government might well be in a position to seize the iPhone's data without Apple's assistance.\n\nSo in this case, at least, Apple can refuse to unlock iPhones at the behest of the government under the All Writs Act. Whether or not that translates to its case against the FBI remains to be seen, but it probably doesn't hurt.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department cannot force Apple to provide the FBI with access to a locked iPhone data in a routine Brooklyn drug case, a magistrate judge ruled Monday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein's written decision gives support to the company's position in its fight against a California judge's order that it create specialized software to help the FBI hack into an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism investigation.

Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced legislation to establish the National Commission on Security and Technology Challenges, whose members would hail from law enforcement, industry, and civil liberties communities, and would recommend policy solutions to the ongoing digital security debate.\n\nIn late December, McCaul and Warner informally proposed creating a commission of \"the brightest minds from the technology sector, the legal world, computer science and cryptography, academia, civil liberties and privacy advocates, law enforcement and intelligence to collaboratively explore the intersection of technology and security.\"\n\nThe commission would have 16 members, with the House speaker and Senate majority leader appointing eight, and the House and Senate minority leaders appointing another eight from the following fields: cryptography; global commerce and economics; federal law enforcement; state and local law enforcement; consumer-facing technology sector; enterprise technology sector; intelligence community; and privacy and civil liberties community.\n\nThe president would appoint one person in an ex officio capacity as a non-voting member.\n\nThe commission would hold a series of hearings and have subpoena authority.\n\nThe body would have to move quickly -- commissioners must be appointed within 30 days of enactment and have its first meeting within 60 days.\n\nAn interim report would be due within six months and a final report would be due in 12 months.\n\nWhile there are other cases in which law enforcement has struggled with obtaining information from phones, the debate has recently centered on the iPhone in the San Bernardino case.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing about that case.\n\nThose questioned during the hearing will be FBI Director James Comey, Apple VP and general counsel Bruce Sewell, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and Worchester Polytech Institute professor Susan Landrau.\n\nRep. Daniel Donovan (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) applauded the idea of creating a commission.\n\n\"The digital security debate is about more than just one phone or one company,\" he said in a statement. \"It's a sweeping question that will define how law enforcement and industry interact for a generation. Frankly, the solution shouldn't be dictated by a bunch of politicians. Chairman McCaul's proposal to bring together law enforcement, technology companies, and privacy advocates is the best way forward -- all roads to a legislative solution should run through this commission.\"\n\nNOT WAITING FOR CONGRESS\n\nAssemblyman Matthew Titone (D-North Shore) has proposed a bill that would require phones sold in New York to have the capability of being decrypted and unlocked should a judge issue such an order.\n\nTitone applauded the move to create a congressional commission, as he has called on Congress to address the matter instead of leaving it up to piecemeal legislation at the state level.\n\nIt's \"much better to have clear guidelines across state borders than state-by-state legislation,\" he said.\n\nTitone said he would press pause on his bill \"pending the time frame of recommendations and implementation.\"\n\nBut \"if they drag their feet, I'm still pushing my state bill.\"\n\nBut he may not get the opportunity to do so if another bill in the House gets passed.\n\nA few weeks ago, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Blake Farenthold (R-TX) sponsored legislation that would block state-level efforts to ban sales of encrypted smartphones, like the bill that Titone put forth.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists. Two albums that are very popular right now were released on Tidal, a streaming service owned by a group of artists headed by Jay-Z. One of those albums is near the top of the charts right now. The other isn't there at all.\n\nRihanna's song \"Work,\" featuring Drake, is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Work\" appears on Rihanna's latest album, Anti, which was initially only sold through Tidal, where she is one of the co-owners. And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers. Apple Music has about 11 million. In the middle of last year, Tidal had only about a million subscribers.\n\nNow Kanye West has put Tidal even more front and center. The album that has a lot of critics and fans wrapped up right now is West's The Life of Pablo. To hear it legally, you've got to pay up and have a Tidal membership.\n\nLike Rihanna, West is a Tidal artist-owner. And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones. Exclusive streaming deals have their own ramifications.\n\nTake for example Drake's inescapable \"Hotline Bling.\" Last fall, when the video for \"Hotline Bling\" was released, Drake was saying how much he was thirsting for a No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. He wrote about his desire very publicly.\n\nDrake's team gave the video to Apple Music as an exclusive -- and the strategy backfired, at least in terms of getting him to his goal of being No. 1. Apple doesn't report its video streams to Nielsen Music, so there was no chance of the song making the top spot as long as it was an Apple exclusive.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Samsung has been in talks from time to time about buying Tidal -- and sources were telling The New York Post this weekend that those talks have resumed in earnest.", "A Waltham man who had been charged with using his Harvard University employee credit card for more than $80,000 in personal purchases plead guilty in Middlesex Superior Court Monday.\n\nShawn Bunn, 45, of Waltham, was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay $80,000 in restitution to the university after pleading guilty to charges of larceny, false entry in corporate books, and uttering of forged documents.\n\n\"For four years the defendant used Harvard University funds for his own purposes,\" said District Attorney Marian Ryan. \"Instead of university funds enriching the educational experience of Harvard students, as intended, the defendant chose to make personal purchases totaling $80,000.\"\n\nBunn worked in a computer lab during his 17 years as an employee at Harvard. During that time, Harvard issued him a credit card for the express purpose of making purchases for the lab.\n\nUniversity policy dictated that Bunn submit a receipt of all purchases over $75 and explain the nature of the purchases, as well as the applicability of the acquired item to his division.\n\nThe defendant purchased multiple Apple products through a university purchasing program that he billed to Harvard but appropriated for personal use. A review by Harvard University's finance department found hundreds of unauthorized purchases on the defendant's Harvard credit card.\n\nWhen authorities executed a search warrant on the defendant's home and office they discovered many of those items including televisions, Star Wars-themed Lego sets, iPads, a table saw, and a compost tumbler.\n\nAdditional items charged to the credit card included approximately 200 DVDs and 100 CDs, Amazon gift cards, seven controllers for a Nintendo Wii video game console, a grand piano bench, and a Dr. Who Tardis cookie jar.\n\nJudge Kimberly Budd sentenced Bunn to two years in the House of Correction with three months to serve to be followed by probation for 10 years.

Now said to be called the iPhone SE, this device has been described in several ways. Some say the device will look like an iPhone 5s, others say that the design will mimic the iPhone 6. While we don't know for sure, Martin Hajek has taken those various thoughts and compiled them into a single comparison image set.\n\nThe three designs show combinations of the features we could see. The first design, based on rumors from 9to5Mac, shows an iPhone 5s body with more rounded edges as opposed to chamfered edges on the existing 5 series models. This design would look most like the iPhone 5s, including the location of the Sleep/Wake button at the top of the device.\n\nThe other two designs, from @onleaks and curved.de, show concepts that look more like an iPhone 6 series device. The curved.de concept actually could be confused for an iPhone 6, with the curves and antenna lines matching what Apple has recently released.\n\nMeanwhile, the @onleaks version has the same rounded edges of the iPhone 6 but has the Sleep/Wake button at the top where it was found on the iPhone 5 line.\n\nThese are just concepts created in the style of rumors. We don't know what it will look like. However, despite the uncertainty of the outer appearance, we're fairly sure on what we'll see inside. The iPhone SE will come with an A9 processor, M9 motion coprocessor, NFC for Apple Pay, and support for taking Live Photos. We're expecting to hear more officially at Apple's event next month, likely in the week of March 21.", "Brooklyn judge denies government's request to unlock iPhone in drug case\n\nBy Reuters\n\nPublished: 23:33 GMT, 29 February 2016 | Updated: 23:33 GMT, 29 February 2016\n\nBy Julia Harte and Julia Edwards\n\nFeb 29 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday rejected a U.S. Justice Department request to order Apple Inc to help law enforcement access data on a locked iPhone, in a ruling that bolsters the company's arguments in a growing privacy fight with the government.\n\nThe government sought access to the phone in October, months before a judge in California ordered Apple to give the government access to the phone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, California, attacks.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in Brooklyn ruled that he did not have the legal authority to order Apple to disable the security of an iPhone seized during a drug investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department is \"disappointed\" in Orenstein's ruling and plans to ask a higher judge within the same federal district to review the matter in coming days, a department representative said.\n\nThough the defendant in the case has already pleaded guilty, the Justice Department still believes the phone may contain evidence that \"will assist us in an active criminal investigation,\" the official said.\n\nWhen fighting the government's order to help extract data from the iPhone, Apple had argued that being forced to do so \"could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\" according to court records.\n\nOrenstein said his ruling in Apple's favor was not a decision on \"whether the government should be able to force Apple to help it unlock a specific device; it is instead whether the All Writs Act resolves that issue and many others like it yet to come.\"\n\nThe implications of the government's position are \"so far-reaching\u007f as to produce impermissibly broad results,\" he wrote.\n\nProsecutors have said that since 2008, Apple has complied with 70 such court orders based on the All Writs Act, a 1789 statute that grants federal courts broad power to issue \"necessary or appropriate writs,\" without objection.\n\nThe case before Brooklyn was, according to prosecutors, the first time Apple had objected to law enforcement efforts to utilize search warrants to get the tech company to provide assistance and unlock iPhones seized during investigations.\n\nBut since October, when Apple first asked Orenstein to deny the government's request, Apple has objected to helping law enforcement access at least 12 devices for which the U.S. Justice Department has sought its help, according to a letter from Apple to Orenstein that was unsealed earlier this month. (Reporting by Julia Edwards and Julia Harte in Washington; Editing by Chris Reese and Lisa Shumaker)", "Apple Senior Vice President and General Counsel Bruce Sewell will be appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday to testify on why giving the FBI the ability to bypass iPhone passcode security measures is a bad idea. FBI Director James Comey will offer up his own testimony, too, explaining why Apple -- and by extension, other technology companies -- should be subject to court orders compelling them to create hackable operating systems for criminal investigations.\n\nApple' Bruce Sewell to defend company's privacy and security position during House Judiciary Committee hearing\n\nMr. Sewell will testify along with Worcester Polytechnic Professor Susan Landau and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance. The hearing is scheduled to start at 1PM eastern time. FBI Director Comey will testify alone in a second hearing.\n\nThe hearing, titled \"The Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americans' Security and Privacy,\" is in response to Apple's opposition to a court order the FBI obtained requiring the company to create a special iOS version that doesn't include the safeguards preventing a brute force attack on iPhone passcodes, and lets the agency automate entering passcodes until the correct one is found.\n\nThe FBI wants the less secure iOS version so it can hack into the iPhone Syed Farook used prior to a shooting rampage where he and his wife killed 14 of their San Bernardino County coworkers and injured 22 more. The husband and wife team were killed in a shootout with police, then the work issued iPhone was recovered.\n\nApple assisted the FBI in retrieving as much data from the iPhone as they could, but stopped short of creating a special operating system the FBI could use to hack into the device. The FBI then obtained a court order compelling Apple to do just that.\n\nApple is contesting the order calling it a threat to privacy and security, and an overreach of government authority. The company filed a motion to vacate the order late last week.\n\nMr. Sewell's opening statements were released to the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's hearing. He will use his opening statement to pose three questions:\n\nShould limits be imposed on the security for private data? Should the FBI have the power to block companies from improving the security in their products? Should the FBI have the authority to force companies to create new tools and products based on government specifications for government use?\n\nMr. Sewell will present a case against giving the FBI and the government those powers, and most likely Ms. Landau will, too. Mr. Vance, however, will explain why he thinks the government should be able to compel companies to strip away security and privacy features from our smartphones and other electronic devices.\n\nMr. Vance's stance comes as no surprise considering he already made it clear he has a long list of cases where he wants to force Apple to help unlock iPhones in criminal investigations.\n\nDirectory Comey originally said this court order would be a one-off case, and that it wasn't a precedent setting event. The DOJ contradicted that a few days later with the revelation that it has at least 12 cases where it plans to do the same, and Mr. Comey conceded a few days ago that it would, in fact, be precedent setting.\n\nTomorrow's hearing won't set policy, although it is the first step in open discussions between government officials and technology companies on the topic. Mr. Sewell will push for a commission on government-mandated iPhone unlocking, and wants to see security, privacy, and encryption addressed at the Congressional level instead of trying to bypass the issue with the All Writs Act, which is over 200 years old and not targeted at modern technologies such as smartphones.\n\n\"The FBI is asking Apple to weaken the security of our products,\" Mr. Sewell's statement reads. \"Hackers and cyber criminals could use this to wreak havoc on our privacy and personal safety. It would set a dangerous precedent for government intrusion on the privacy and safety of its citizens.\"\n\nNext up: Mr. Sewell's full statement to the House Judiciary Committee\n\nPages:\n\n1 2 Next \"", "NEW YORK (AP) - The U.S. Justice Department cannot force Apple to provide the FBI with access to locked iPhone data in a routine Brooklyn drug case, a federal judge ruled Monday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein's written decision gives support to the company's position in its fight against a California judge's order that it create specialized software to help the FBI hack into an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism investigation.

They can tap on the Cast icon in a compatible music app and their device will listen out for an ultrasonic authorisation signal from the Chromecast Audio.\n\nSTREAMING MUSIC\n\nSending music to your speakers is easy. The Chromecast Audio shows up as an available speaker when you click on the dropdown Cast menu in compatible apps. It's similar to Apple's Airplay streaming music ecosystem, but these adaptors are not compatible with Airplay so you can't stream from iTunes.\n\nYour speakers make a reassuring beep when your device connects to the adaptor, a sound which can be disabled, but you'll want to leave it on while you grow comfortable with the system because the adaptors can be very slow to connect sometimes.\n\nYou'll find support for Chromecast Audio streaming in a range of mobile apps including Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Deezer, NPR One, 7digital, Plex and others. Streaming works with Android and Apple devices, along with desktop browsers.\n\nIf you've got your eye on a Google Music Family subscription be aware that you can only set it up via an Android device - the kind of frustrating restriction you'd expect from Apple but not Google.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nAt this point you're obviously at the mercy of your speakers. I tested two Chromecast Audio adaptors, each connected to a decent set of powered 2.1-channel Harman Kardon Soundsticks II speakers.\n\nThe Chromecast Audio is powered via micro-USB using the supplied AC adaptor. There's also a combination analogue/digital audio output, so you can plug in practically any speakers which feature a 3.5mm input or else connect to the SP/DIF digital audio input on an amplifier.\n\nIf you're really fussy about sound quality you'll find that music from Chromecast Audio's analogue output sounds a tad flat and murky when compared to streaming via an Airport Express. It's only a subtle difference, to be fair it didn't bother me too much once I stopped specifically listening for it.\n\nInitially I suspected the underwhelming sound quality was due to the Chromecast Audio featuring a cheap Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC), the gizmo which turns all the ones and zeros into sound.\n\nBut dig around in the Chromecast app's advanced settings and you'll find a Full Dynamic Range option which is disabled by default for the analogue output. Enabling this improves the sound, but you might only notice the difference if you're using decent speakers and high-quality content.\n\nAudiophiles will also be pleased to hear that the Chromecast Audio handles 96KHz/24-bit lossless audio playback, something Airplay and Sonos don't support.\n\nA BUM NOTE\n\nConnected to my 5GHz network the Chromecast Audio adaptors were rock solid for a few hours, streaming from Apple and Android devices as well as Google Play Music running in the Chrome browser on my Mac. Then everything went haywire.\n\nFor no apparent reason my iPhone sputtered for 15 minutes and then surprisingly asked for the Guest PIN even though it had been happily streaming across my wi-fi network all morning.\n\nAt that point everything went to hell and none of my devices could connect to the adaptors. Eventually I was forced to perform factory resets on both adaptors, as well as restart my wi-fi network.\n\nThis naturally shook my faith in Google's Chromecast Audio adaptors, even though disabling Guest mode seems to solve the problem. I still have to say they're far more reliable than Apple's Airplay, which in my home has been a flaky mess since about iOS7.\n\nThe sad truth is that wireless streaming can be a dark art and your mileage may vary for a myriad of reasons which can be hard to pin down. The only truly bulletproof streaming music system I've ever tested is Sonos which generates its own private 5GHz mesh network.\n\nSO WHAT'S THE VERDICT?\n\nThe Guest mode hiccup spoiled a great first impression but tat aside the Chromecast Audio is an amazing little gadget.\n\nIf Airplay's flakiness is putting a dent in your household harmony, as it has in mine, then it's certainly worth trying out Google's alternative.\n\nAt this point I'm expecting to rip out all of my unreliable Airport Express base stations and replace them with Chromecast Audio adaptors.\n\nI still say Sonos is the gold standard when it comes to multiroom audio in terms of functionality, ease of use and sound quality. If you're purchasing Chromecast Audio adaptors you'll still need to spend good money on decent speakers to rival Sonos' sound quality.\n\nBut if you're looking to dip your toe into wireless multiroom audio without spending a bundle, Google's Chromecast Audio will certainly be music to your ears.", "A rumor from last month suggested that the iPhone 7 Plus could come in a variant that sports a dual camera setup. However the rumor also claimed that this dual camera setup might only be limited to a higher-end iPhone 7 Plus, basically aimed towards users who might appreciate and be willing to pay for a higher-end iPhone as long as it could take better quality photographs.\n\nNow according to a report from Chinese website MyDrivers (via MacRumors), it has been suggested that the device in question could be known as the iPhone Pro in a bid to distinguish itself from the rest of the iPhone 7 models that will be available, kind of like how the iPad Pro sets itself apart from the iPad mini and iPad Air lineup.\n\nIf you're wondering why the iPhone Pro sounds familiar, it is because the other day a report from Forbes indicated that this could be Apple's new naming scheme. However the report suggested that the name might be applied to the entire iPhone 7 lineup, but this report claims that it will only be applied to the dual camera iPhone 7 Plus model.\n\nOf course you should take it with a grain of salt for now, but as more iPhone models hit the market, we expect that Apple will eventually want to start creating a new naming and branding scheme, so that it will start to look more refreshed and exciting, kind of like the rumored 4-inch iPhone SE which reportedly dropped the \"5\" from its moniker.", "Ruling: All Writs Act can't be used to achieve goal that Congress hasn't granted.\n\nA judge in New York ruled Monday in favor of Apple in a case where investigators wanted the court to compel the company to unlock a seized iPhone 5S running iOS 7, which the company does have the ability to unlock.\n\nThis case involves a drug dealer who has already pleaded guilty. It pre-dates Apple's current battle with the government over a locked iPhone 5C that belonged to one of the shooters in the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino -- that case is due to be heard in court next month in nearby Riverside, California. (By contrast, the San Bernardino case involves an iPhone 5c, running iOS 9, which Apple says it cannot unlock. In the California case, federal investigators asked for and received an unprecedented court order compelling Apple to create a new firmware. Last week, Apple formally challenged that order.)\n\nHowever, in both the San Bernardino and the New York cases, Apple fought the government's attempt to use the same law, known as the All Writs Act -- an obscure catchall statute that dates back to the 18th Century. There are several related AWA cases involving unlocking Apple devices that remain pending nationwide.\n\nUS Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, who had also previously rejected the government's arguments in another All Writs Act case involving Apple in early October 2015, said that what the government is asking for is going too far.\n\nJudge Orenstein's Monday ruling has no bearing on the outcome of the San Bernardino case as they are proceeding in different federal judicial districts. Apple hopes, however, that that Riverside judge will be \"persuaded\" by the decision, according to a company executive who was granted anonymity on a call with reporters.\n\nAs he wrote in his Monday ruling:\n\nIn short, whatever else the AWA's \"usages and principles\" clause may be intended to accomplish, it cannot be a means for the executive branch to achieve a legislative goal that Congress has considered and rejected. But because such rejection can take many forms, only one of which (and arguably the least likely in most circumstances) is outright prohibition, the government's argument here is manifestly irreconcilable with the statute.\n\nThe New York case began back in October 2015, when Judge Orenstein invited Apple to tell the court why it felt that the government could not compel it to unlock a seized phone. At the time, bringing Apple into a case like this was new.\n\nNine days later, defendant Jun Feng pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Judge Orenstein then asked the government why the issue of Apple's compliance was not moot given the guilty plea.\n\nIf Feng's phone had iOS 8 or later installed -- as 90 percent of iPhones do -- this entire issue would likely be moot. Apple now enables full encryption by default, and the company specifically said the move happened \"so it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8.\"\n\nThis story is developing.", "The technology of the day has everything to do with how you get your music -- and the music business is pushing more and more toward streaming.\n\nWith services like Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Apple Music, there are a bunch of companies that want your ears -- and your money.\n\nAnd a lot of those companies are trying to get exclusives from artists.

And Anti went platinum.\n\nBut the way that Anti achieved that feat wasn't through Tidal. Last year, Rihanna signed a deal with Samsung that was reputed to be worth $25 million. Part of that deal was that Samsung gave away a million copies of Anti to fans. Tidal has stated that it sold almost another half million downloads of Rihanna's album, but those free downloads got Rihanna to platinum.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) determines whether an album goes platinum or gold. And it recently changed its rules to include streams in its accounting. So the Samsung giveaways alone gained Anti platinum status less than two days after it became available.\n\nThis all meant a big win for Rihanna: She received a huge sponsorship deal, a big wave of interest in a company of which she is a part owner, and the cachet of becoming a platinum artist in an incredibly short window of time.\n\nThe Rihanna project gave a big boost to Tidal's visibility. And that's something the company still needs. As a paid service, it's lagging behind its competitors. Spotify has more than 75 million users, including 20 million paying subsrcibers.

And like Rihanna, he is definitely making money on his release both as a creative force and a businessman. Tidal's subscription numbers have reportedly surged since The Life of Pablo was released.\n\nDespite all of the publicity surrounding this album, The Life of Pablo isn't charting because Tidal doesn't report its streams to Nielsen Music, the company that determines the Billboard charts, and it has not been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA. These days, Nielsen Music tracks sales in all formats (downloads, CDs, vinyl and so forth), as well as streams from services like Spotify, Beats Music and Rhapsody, video views on platforms like YouTube, and radio streams both online and on terrestrial radio. They have a proprietary algorithm that incorporates these various media into their chart formula.\n\nSo in the case of The Life of Pablo, an album at the epicenter of the cultural conversation isn't part of the official historical record in certain ways.\n\nAll these exclusives mean that music fans may have to start budgeting for multiple subscriptions to hear their favorite artists' recorded work. Just as you may already be setting aside money for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu to see all the movies and TV series you want, you might now be stashing money aside every month for a combination of, say, Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.\n\nEven while some of these services, and especially Tidal, seem to be betting that artist exclusives will be their path to market share, it isn't always working out so well for musicians -- even the extremely popular ones.

Coal and oil prices are way down, there are big changes to environmental regulations in the works, and more and more renewables are coming online. Some of the biggest players in the industry met at a conference in Houston this week to weigh in on what it all means. Inside Energy reporter Jordan Wirfs-Brock was at IHS CERAWeek. She spoke to Wyoming Public Radio's Stephanie Joyce from the conference about the biggest issues on the table for the energy industry.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nJOYCE: So, Jordan, last year, CERAWeek was in April. Oil prices at the time had been going down for 6 months or so at the time and the focus then was on innovation, survival, winners and losers. How was the conference different this year?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Well, since last year, oil prices have only continued to fall and they've gone far lower than people expected, and they've stayed lower for far longer. So everyone here wants to know what's going to happen in the future. Are prices going to stay this way or are they going to start ticking back up sometime soon? And so one of the sort of most anticipated speakers this week was the Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi, and people really wanted to know whether he was going to give some kind of a clue as to whether they were going to cut production, which would help drive prices back up. And bottom line is he said they're not going to cut production, don't expect that to happen from any of the other major oil producing countries. So essentially companies are going to have to just survive.\n\nNo one really wanted to go out on a limb and say when prices are going to come back up, but the general sort of discussion was that they will kind of creep up but not to where they were. We're not going to be seeing $100 a barrel for oil anytime soon.\n\nJOYCE: So, I guess, in addition to the oil and gas industry players, I know the conference always features some major policy makers. Gina McCarthy was there, the head of the Environment Protection Agency, what did she talk about?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Well, everyone was expecting her to talk about the Clean Power Plan, which is the Obama administration's new rules for cutting carbon emissions in the near future, and she did not disappoint. A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a stay on the ruling and McCarthy had a nice little description of her reaction to that moment.\n\nMCCARTHY: I think my head hit the table. Only because it was unexpected. But within 10 minutes I was back in action.\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Her bottom line and basic message was that the Clean Power Plan is here to stay. The EPA is not going to back down on this. People may fight it, many states are suing over this, but essentially all of this is not going to slow down our transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\nJOYCE: And did McCarthy address any other regulations that are coming down the line?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Yeah, a big topic of discussion this week was actually methane leaks. The recently Aliso Canyon leak in Southern California kind of brought this issue to the forefront, and so a lot of people have been paying attention to methane that can leak from all parts of the natural gas system -- from the well pad, from pipelines, all the way to people's homes and the sort of the end of the line of the infrastructure.\n\nAnd McCarthy did address this. She mentioned how recently the EPA updated the way it actually calculates methane emissions and how we come up with our inventory for the US, and essentially she says for years we've been underestimating this issue. Here is another bite from McCarthy.\n\nMCCARTHY: The new information shows that methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and gas sector are substantially higher than we previously understood.\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Last year, they announced some proposed regulations those are going to be finalized later this year and the Bureau of Land Management is that also tackling this issue, so stay tuned for more on methane.\n\nJOYCE: And so there was another key administration player there, the energy secretary Ernest Moniz. What was his agenda, what did he talk about?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Well, he talked about a wide range of issues and and he's always a pretty entertaining guy, so he actually provided one of the funniest moments of the conference, when IHS chair Daniel Yergin was interviewing him, he asked him about the recent idea President Obama put forward for a $10 a barrel fee on oil.\n\nYERGIN: Can you explain to us where the thinking is on this $10/barrel fee of oil?\n\nMONIZ: Well, look, I'm just gonna say that this is going to be the classic answering a different question.\n\n[laughter]\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: So, where we went from there is that Moniz actually brought up that we have a huge, hairy problem which is how do we pay for our aging, crumbling transportation infrastructure? It's going to be expensive, we don't have the money to do it and he said, you know, \"you try to come up with a better solution,\" so that's what he talked about in terms of that $10 a barrel fee on oil.\n\nJOYCE: Definitely something that I imagine was not greeted with enthusiasm in that room. You know, the Energy Department has come out with a number of reports and studies recently about the future of energy in this country and the policy to guide that future. Did Moniz have anything to say about that?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Well, one of the most exciting and disruptive technologies that he talked about was actually electric vehicles and self-driving cars. During the press conference it actually came out that it seems like he's pretty bullish on the idea of self-driving cars -- that they're coming and they're coming sooner than we think and that they will fundamentally change the way that we use energy for transportation. And also, in addition to Moniz, the CTO of Tesla Motors was there, JB Straubel, and he was very optimistic. Basically he said that in the next 5 to 10 years we're going to see millions of electric vehicles on the road.\n\nJOYCE: One of the last big speakers of the conference, I understand, was from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees the grid. What did FERC Chairman Norman Bay focus on in his presentation?\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: He talked a lot about energy storage -- and this was something that all of the people presenting on utilities in the power sector really emphasized as the future. We've known for a while that energy storage at the utility-scale is going to be necessary to bring on renewables on a very large scale across the electric grid. But the issue has always been cost and these technologies have not been commercially viable yet. But what Norman Bay said is that costs are dropping, and they're dropping faster than people had expected them to. And so here's a bite from Norman Bay, talking about what that means.\n\nBAY: Some analysts have predicted that costs will decline 50 percent over the next five years, to the point where, in some markets, energy storage systems can be cost competitive.\n\nWIRFS-BROCK: Essentially, his point is that in the next few years instead of building new power plants, things like natural gas fired power plants, to meet demand, it will actually be economically viable to instead put in storage systems that can accommodate renewables. So that is that is huge. Essentially the combination of storage systems with renewables will make that cost competitive with more traditional power plants.\n\nJOYCE: Lots to keep an eye on in 2016, it sounds like. Thank you so much, Jordan.", "(TNS) -- A state Senate committee on Thursday effectively tabled a controversial bill that would prevent Tesla Motors Inc. from selling cars in Indiana under its current business model.\n\nThe Senate Commerce and Technology Committee voted to send HB 1254 to a summer study committee. The House passed the same version of the bill Feb. 2.\n\nSen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, the committee chairman, had wanted to move forward a version of Rep. Kevin Mahan's bill that would have banned manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. The bill would have caused Tesla's dealer license to expire in 2018, forcing the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company to either adopt a franchise dealer model or stop selling cars in Indiana. Tesla has a showroom at Fashion Mall at Keystone.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. has expressed support for the bill, arguing that Tesla has a unique advantage. Existing state law prevents General Motors and other automakers from opening sales centers like Tesla's that would compete with its dealerships.\n\nBuck on Thursday opened the committee meeting by saying he has been on the receiving end of \"incivility\" from Tesla supporters this week.\n\n\"So far in this discourse, GM has been the whipping boy,\" Buck said. \"That has irritated me, primarily because it's not true.\"\n\nMahan, R-Hartford City, noted Tesla could continue to sell cars in Indiana if his bill were to pass.\n\n\"We heard from a competitor that the bill would have ended their ability to do business in Indiana,\" Mahan said. \"That would have been their choice not to comply with the law.\"", "Did you hear about this? A proposed bill from Indiana state representative Kevin Mahan would have required Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA) to establish a franchised dealership in Indiana in order to sell vehicles, according to Bloomberg Business.\n\nAnd that would have had a major impact on the Tesla stock price...\n\nBecause Tesla only has stores and galleries in 27 states, this bill could have created a dangerous precedent for the company in places outside of Indiana. The controversial House Bill 1254 didn't pass yesterday, but it has been tabled until the summer.\n\nEven though the bill is postponed, the electric vehicle maker remains confident in its future.\n\n\"We look forward to participating in the upcoming summer study process where we will be able to fully air the issues of vehicle sales and consumer choice in an open and public forum,\" Tesla stated yesterday.\n\nDespite the news, Money Morning is still very bullish on TSLA stock. In fact, we found a new $488 billion industry that Tesla has set its sights on. And it's going to make the Tesla stock price skyrocket for years to come.\n\nBut before we discuss Tesla's incredible opportunity, here's more information about the bill that could have sent the TSLA stock price plummeting.\n\nWhile Tesla does have a store in Indiana, the stores and galleries don't operate like traditional dealerships. The stores and galleries are used to bring in customers who may have questions about Tesla or want to customize their vehicle, and then they can place orders online.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Business, General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) lobbied to have this bill introduced to the Senate. In a statement, GM said that the bill was introduced to demonstrate the inequality for different competitors in the automobile industry.\n\nRepresentative Mahan said he welcomes Tesla to Indiana, but he wants CEO Elon Musk's company to have a dealership in the state to keep price competition fair. He also wants Tesla to become more involved in the local community.\n\nYou see, this bill indicates that GM is eyeing Tesla's growing foothold in a new $488 billion market. And this market is exactly why the Tesla stock price will skyrocket...", "THERE are a couple of businessmen connected to the world of cars and transport that I hold in very high regard - Virgin's Richard Branson and Tesla's Elon Musk.\n\nRichard Branson is a maverick of the first order - a rule breaker, a visionary and a man who just appears to glide through a seemingly easy life making air travel and train travel better for the masses.\n\nHe makes business mistakes, as he freely admits, but he learns from them and moves on. I like that about him.\n\nHe changes the face of how we move people and things about and I applaud that.\n\nHowever, he has ambitions to travel into space and that is where Mr Branson and I don't see eye to eye. He'll be gutted not to have my support.\n\nElon Musk is a man in a similar mould to Branson - a serial entrepreneur, inventor and man on a mission.\n\nFrom Paypal to Tesla Motors, Mr Musk has the Midas touch. He has lofty ambitions to help change the world and humanity.\n\nHis ultimate goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, as well as reducing the chance of human extinction by making life multi-planetary and setting up a human colony on Mars.\n\nThese goals are being achieved with SolarCity, Tesla Motors and SpaceX.\n\nI just don't get the entrepreneurial need to travel into space or colonise other planets, having made a bit of a mess of this one.\n\nSurely, a man with a gift would find a way to overcome famine, drought, war or even just eradicate potholes forever and provide some housing for people living on the streets?\n\nImproving the transport here on Earth might be a way of bringing social inclusion, helping people from remote and transport-poor areas get to work, to be productive and add to our society.\n\nThe commercial space race has to be a vanity project of monumental proportions, surely?\n\nGuys, how about a car that cleans the air as it drives? What about improving the real world that kills hundreds of thousands every year through poor air quality?\n\nNo? I'll get my spacesuit on then.", "GM is supporting a \"Kill Tesla\" bill that will eliminate the company's chances to sell cars in the state of Indiana\n\nThe electric vehicle fight between General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Tesla Motors is reaching a new level. Both automakers are expected to go head-to-head in 2017, when they will launch their respective cheaper mass market electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nTesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is considered a pioneer in the EV field, having already sold thousands of EVs, and it looks like the Model 3 EV will potentially beat GM's Chevrolet Bolt. However, while sitting on a huge pile of cash, the Detroit automaker can nonetheless give Tesla a run for its money.\n\nBoth vehicles cost in the range of $30,000 to $35,000, while prices can further drop after federal tax incentives. Similar to Tesla's Model 3, GM has promised the Chevy Bolt can reap over 200 miles on full battery charge. Such close specs, and similar prices, makes the tussle between the two companies even more interesting.\n\nHowever, GM has found a new way to hit Tesla; making the company unable to sell its cars. According to Bloomberg, GM is supporting a \"Kill Tesla\" bill that will eliminate Tesla's chances to sell cars in the state of Indiana.\n\nTesla Motors has publicly accused GM of being behind this legislation, as the Detroit automaker does not want Tesla to directly sell cars to customers, a practice followed by the latter. Tesla does not sell cars through the traditional dealership business model; rather, it prefers selling cars at Tesla Stores. This practice is severely criticized by traditional automakers, such as GM and Ford Motor Company, who have been operating with dealerships for decades.\n\nTesla feels that green car manufacturers should be supported by auto regulators, and allowed to sell cars directly to customers, thus leveling the playing field with auto giants. Tesla has been fighting legal battles in several states, where its banned from selling cars to customers by bypassing dealerships.\n\nSo far, Tesla was licensed for direct selling in Indiana, but after the bill becomes law, Tesla will not be able to sell cars in the state. This will be clipping Tesla's dream to boost sales of EV and eventually reach its delivery target of 500,000 by 2020.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the bill was introduced by Indiana State Representative Kevin Mahan, and states that dealer license issued to all EV manufacturers \"expires after 30 months and may not be renewed.\" This means Tesla may not be allowed to sell cars in Indiana somewhere in 2018, when Tesla plans to boost sales with three cars; Model S, Model X and Model 3.\n\nJust as Tesla is transforming from a niche market seller towards mass market, the car maker is expected to face similar hurdles from auto regulators and traditional car makers. So far, Tesla has been selling the high-end Model S sedan, and recently launched Model X crossover Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV), whose price can exceed $100,000 with additional features.\n\nTesla also plans to expand to the masses with the third generation Model 3, which will directly compete with GM's Chevy Bolt. It will be difficult for Tesla to convince lawmakers and auto regulators to allow selling cheaper cars, when its competitors are still practicing their operations with dealerships.\n\nEarler in 2014, Tesla was hit with by a similar challenge, when it was banned from selling cars in Michigan, a state famous for being the home turf of the \"Big Three\" automakers. Last month at the Detroit Auto Show, Tesla decided not to participate, because of its inability to sell cars there. The company decided to not market cars where they cannot be sold to fans. Though the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last May asked the Michigan State Legislature to reconsider the ban, nothing so far has been fruitful for the EV maker.\n\nTesla stock is currently trading at $189.42 up 1.06% as of 1:47 PM EST. The company has a rough start to the year, already losing 21.19% in stock price since the start of the year.", "Tesla Motors has increased the range of its roadside assistance program from 50 to 500 miles. Effective immediately, the generous -- and long overdue -- increase was made to give current and future Tesla drivers extra peace of mind.\n\nTesla's roadside assistance service is free for four years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first, if the car becomes inoperable due to a problem that's covered under warranty. The basic warranty covers issues with the battery pack, with the electric motor(s), and with the components that make up the restraint system, such as the airbags and the seat belts. According to Tesla, owners don't benefit from 500 miles of free towing if they get stranded by adverse environmental conditions such as hail, acid rain, fire, or water, or by \"an act of God.\" Flat tires and accidents don't qualify, either, and owners are limited to a single tow per incident.\n\n500 miles is undeniably better than the 50 that Tesla customers had to live with until recently, but it still falls short of what many other car makers offer. As Autoblog Green accurately points out, Dodge's roadside assistance program includes towing to the nearest dealership no matter how far away it is. Hyundai's does too. Mercedes will tow a car back to an authorized dealer for free if the owner chooses to have it repaired there; if not, towing costs $150. New BMWs come with a similar plan that's good for four years with no mileage restrictions to speak of.\n\nRelated: Radio Flyer's kid-sized Tesla Model S redefines the term 'early adopter'\n\nTesla drivers only benefit from the 500-mile towing plan if they live in North America, and the company hasn't announced if it'll increase the range of its roadside assistance program overseas. Across most of Europe, the California-based firm continues to offer its customers just 50 miles of free towing.\n\nAlso watch: 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus First Drive", "Sears in the U.S., which has both the Sears and Kmart chains, reported a loss of $580 million, or $5.44 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 30.\n\nIn a case of the old economy colliding with the new, Sears' CEO Thursday cited the advantages that upstarts like Uber, Tesla Motors and Amazon hold over old-line companies like his own in announcing a deeper fourth-quarter loss than a year ago.\n\nCEO Edward Lampert invoked the newcomers' names to raise a shopping list of complaints about perceived disadvantages confronting what was once one of the nation's iconic retailers, from sales tax collection to a higher minimum wage, which he says makes it difficult to compete against successful online businesses.\n\nSears, which has both the Sears and Kmart chains, reported a loss of $580 million, or $5.44 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 30, compared with a loss of $159 million, or $1.50 a share, in the year-ago quarter. All figures are U.S. dollars. The adjusted loss of $1.70 a share was better than analysts had forecast, a loss of $2.62 a share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue came in at $7.3 billion, down from $8.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, marginally better than expectations. Most of the revenue decline was due to same-store sales falling, though some of it was attributed to having fewer Sears and Kmart stores.\n\nAs a result, Sears shares closed 55 cents higher at $17.52 a share, up 3.2 per cent.\n\nBut aside from the numbers, what captured attention was Lampert's lengthy lament about the state of the traditional retail industry -- and Sears' place on it.\n\nHe cited Tesla as being among the newer companies that \"rely heavily on continued financing.\" By contrast, \"companies viewed through a more traditional lens, like Sears Holdings, are met with skepticism even though we have an enormous asset base and a proven history of monetizing these assets and raising additional capital to fund our obligation ns and transformation.\"\n\nUber, the ride-sharing service, has raised billions even as it takes losses in key markets like China, Lampert wrote. Yet companies like his own \"are held to a very different standard when it comes to profitability and regulation.\"\n\nOnline merchants often don't have to collect sales taxes, unlike Sears. And \"large companies like Sears Holdings have also been met with additional burdens like higher minimum wage costs,\" he said. \"With stores that are marginally profitable or unprofitable, such additional cost burdens can be the straw that breaks the camel's back, causing stores to close and eliminate jobs,\" he added.\n\nDespite Lampert's outcry, analysts haven't been as sympathetic to Sears' woes. \"Much of this decline is still the result of things that Sears is getting wrong,\" says Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino. The long slide in sales and profit shows that the company hasn't come \"to grips with getting the business back on track. They're almost just managing the decline the best they can.\"\n\nSears has undergone a long slide as it has shrunk its store network. While many retailers experienced a soft quarter, Sears' sales declines were worse than most and follow roughly a decade of poor performance. Five years ago, Sears' shares were trading above $60.\n\nSears warned earlier this month that it didn't expect to fare well in the quarter and said it would accelerate 50 planned store closures this year as well as look for other ways to cut costs. The company ended the year with 1,672 Sears and Kmart stores.\n\nSome of Sears' problems in the critical fourth quarter -- when holiday shopping hits its peak -- was due to unseasonably warm weather that dampened enthusiasm for cold-weather apparel and other merchandise. Lampert also said that the heightened competition during the busy holiday season led to \"higher than expected markdowns.\"\n\nSales at Sears and Kmart stores open at least a year fell 6.9 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively. Still, those declines were the best sales performance of the year, the company said.\n\nConsumer electronics sales were a sore point for both brands, impacting the sales declines by several percentage points. Apparel, grocery and home items also saw sales declines at Kmart, while Sears saw declines in apparel, footwear, home, tools and sporting goods.\n\nLampert reiterated that the company plans to accelerate the timeline of its transformation into a retailer better integrated with digital services and focused on a member loyalty program to drive sales. Sears plans to reduce costs by up to $650 million this year, after cutting approximately $150 million in expenses in the fourth quarter.\n\nSears reported it had $238 million in cash as of Jan. 30, down from $250 million the previous year. Fitch Ratings says Sears had had significant cash burn, with a liquidity position that is about $1.4 billion less than expected. Sears is among 218 companies listed by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services earlier this month as being among the \"weakest links,\" having the lowest credit ratings with a negative outlook.\n\nThe problem with Sears' financial maneuvers is they don't do anything to lure customers, which is ultimately the issue the company faces, Saunders says.\n\nMore on Sears' part than Kmart's, product assortment between fashion and appliances is confusing for customers, Saunders says, and management's focus on improving liquidity for the business as a whole is taking focus away from vital improvements that need to be made to update stores.\n\nAnother retailer, J.C. Penney, reports Friday, again opening a windows into how older chains are faring in a rapidly changing economy.", "Tesla stock is back on the rise again today after hitting the skids earlier this month not long before and after the automaker's disappointing earnings report. Of course part of the issue has been the loss of the momentum that carried the stock and other investor favorites along for much of last year, but there's no denying the risk that goes along with owning Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares.\n\nShares are trading at $187.95 as of this writing. It appears Tesla stock is testing the $190 level as it starts to pull back right after briefly topping $190 per share.\n\nGoldman Sacha analyst Patrick Archambault and team issued a report today covering their recent trip to Silicon Valley in which they visited Tesla and other automotive-related companies, including suppliers. One of their stops was at Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif. where they met with CEO Elon Musk, Autopilot Director Sterling Anderson and CFO Jason Wheeler.\n\nThey report that the factory has changed a lot since they visited the last time over a year ago. For example, they said the automaker has grown into the space it has and now is more fully utilizing it. In fact, they expect future expansions will result in non-assembly functions being moved to satellite facilities.\n\nCurrently Tesla has five facilities, including the main factory in Fremont, the gigafactory, facilities for metal casting and assembling seats, and another light manufacturing facility in the Netherlands. The automaker is running about an 80% vertically integrated operation.\n\nAnalysts from multiple firms have made it clear that Tesla stock depends heavily on what happens with the Model X. We've known for quite some time that the automaker has been having trouble producing the crossover vehicle, and this has impacted its ability to meet its delivery targets.\n\nThe Goldman team found on their visit to the Fremont factory that there are Model Xs coming down the assembly line \"interspersed with Model S vehicles.\" They added that the body shop that's working on the SUV still isn't running at full capacity as Tesla management said they're doing what they call burst builds,\" which involves assembling a group of the SUVs and then inspect them fully at various stages throughout assembly.\n\nAlso on their manufacturing tour, Archambault and team found that Tesla continues to improve its battery cells in density, safety and duration, with some tests checking for more than 1,000 cycles to improve duration. They noted that although the automaker doesn't specifically outline exact costs, representatives said $200 per kilowatt-hour is about where they are right now, and they're targeting less than $100 per kilowatt-hour per pack.\n\nThe analysts also had questions for Wheeler about cash flow definitions, a topic which investors would do well to pay attention to as it concerns some bears quite a lot. Recently the automaker revealed what it calls \"core operational cash flow,\" a new idea that involves another new term called \"asset backed lending.\" Management sees this new cash flow reporting method as being fair because firm customer orders back all of their \"finished goods inventory\" (FGI).\n\nThe Goldman team explained that \"the ABL becomes more about managing the cash cycle as they grow the business than just adding leverage,\" adding, \"The facility will be leveraged quite a bit in the second quarter when the company builds out FGI to support international expansion of the Model X, particularly as FGI inventories were significantly drawn down in 4Q15.\"\n\nThey don't seem too worried about the ABL, which Tesla management assured them will enable the ramps of the Model X and S to self-fund. However, they're still looking into how much cash the Model 3 mass market car will require as it will require a lot more investment because they intend it to be a high volume car.\n\nIn their meeting with Musk and Anderson, they discussed technological developments, and one of the big topics lately has been autonomous driving. Tesla, Google and others are in a race to be the first to roll out fully autonomous vehicles, and Musk told the Goldman analysts that he has become skeptical that machine learning and Deep Neural Networks will be able to handle some of the harder problems with artificial intelligence.\n\nAutonomous vehicles will have to solve problems with 99.999% accuracy to be viable in the mass market, and he said that machine learning can reach 80% or 90% accuracy but comes up short of where it needs to be. Further, he said no one will be surprised by the emergence of autonomous vehicles as regulators will need vast amounts of data to prove that they are a lot safer than cars driven by humans. He noted that in some international regions like Hong Kong, regulators pushed back against their attempt to implement the semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla stock climbed by more than 1% before beginning to pull back as the regular trading day wore on.", "Venture capital groups invested $1.8 billion in commercial space startups in 2015, more than in the last 15 years combined, a report by aerospace consultants the Tauri Group shows.\n\nThe lion's share of the 2015 space investments was a $1 billion round of financing for Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, founded and overseen by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors Inc.\n\n\"The year 2015 was a record-setting year for space ventures, with investment and debt financing of $2.7 billion,\" according to the Tauri Group's \"Start-Up Space\" report, which was released on Monday.\n\nWhile individual investors are not always disclosed, the Tauri Group found that 21 people on the Forbes' billionaires list have an affiliation to a space enterprise.

While it doesn't have any state or federal funding, it already has one client: Honda Motor Co.\n\nWillow Run, by contrast, has a triple-level overpass and, nearby, underused lanes on U.S. Highway 12 where planners say test cars from multiple makers could travel in squadrons, reaching 75 miles per hour and negotiating tight turns, bridges and tunnels. Backers intend to leave some parts of the site rugged, to mimic real-world conditions, while paving new roads and erecting fake storefronts to create urban and highway environments. The factory itself was torn down last year.\n\nThe state of Michigan has put up $20 million to start developing the site and to buy the property from Racer Trust, an entity created after General Motors' 2009 bankruptcy to dispose of its former factories. The Willow Run factory became a GM transmission plant after serving as part of Detroit's famed Arsenal of Democracy, spitting out one shiny B-24 Liberator bomber every hour. Among its 42,000 wartime employees was Rose Will Monroe, celebrated in bond-sales films as Rosie the Riveter, based on the iconic poster and song.\n\nThe planned $80 million conversion of Willow Run is key to efforts by Michigan business leaders and politicians to keep Detroit at the center of automaking. The mission has taken on added urgency as Google dominates development of self-driving cars, with Apple Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. also in pursuit. U.S. safety regulators this month told Google its artificial-intelligence system can be considered a replacement for human drivers and are fast-tracking efforts to establish new rules of the road for autonomous autos.\n\nAs with any real estate discussion, location is key - and backers of each site say theirs prevails.\n\nFor California, it's access to technology companies. GoMentum Station has one attribute that trumps everything Michigan has to offer, Iwasaki said: \"We're literally 39 miles north of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nThe Michigan team touts its access to a wide number of automakers and more than a century of experience. Three-quarters of the industry's research and development money is spent in Michigan, or about $8 billion, said Kevin Kerrigan, a senior adviser to Michigan Governor Rick Snyder. The site would work in conjunction with the University of Michigan's Mcity, a 32-acre faux town just 12 miles from the Willow Run location, has been booked solid with autonomous testing since opening last summer.\n\n\"Connected vehicles do not work unless a General Motors car can talk to a Honda,\" said Gary Peters, a Democrat and Michigan's junior U.S. senator, who is pushing for federal funding. \"They all have to be in the same test facility, running their cars.\"\n\nWillow Run's backers are also pitching the site as a place where federal regulators could test driverless cars to ensure they meet safety rules.\n\nIn the end, supporters say the rugged roads, spotty infrastructure and cold weather for which Michiganders get chided may be the very selling points needed to win the day, since autonomous technology can be afflicted with snow blindness.\n\n\"If you can't test cars in snow and ice,\" Peters said, \"you're in trouble.\"", "The move is a shrewd one for an industry that has been on the defensive for years on climate issues, constantly fending off attacks that its products have contributed to an unhealthy rise in global temperatures.\n\nWhile the landmark emissions-reduction agreement among 195 countries late last year was seen as a defeat for fossil fuel producers, executives and oil ministers sounded a clarion call this week at their first major meeting since the Paris talks for more research into how carbon capture technology can be cheapened and perfected.\n\nThe hope is that this and other technologies could sharply cut oil and natural gas emissions, protect the industry from the ramifications of climate change legislation and ensure developing economies still have access to inexpensive energy.\n\n\"If you could eliminate all of the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion, then you could use those fuels as long as you want,\" Robert Armstrong, director of the MIT Energy Initiative, said in an interview on the sidelines of IHS CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of oil executives.\n\n\"It's just a matter of making those technologies competitive in the market.\"\n\nThat could help the oil industry avoid the worst-case scenario for a post-Paris world: governments forcing oil and gas production to cease in certain areas.\n\nAli Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, called climate change a greater challenge for his industry than even crude price CLc1 gyrations.\n\nNaimi, who attended the Paris meetings, said his nation - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' de facto leader - is committed to finding technological solutions to slash emissions.\n\n\"We recognize the threat posed by climate change,\" he said. \"We and many others have invested time, money and brain power into seeking technological solutions to the challenges posed by climate change, in particular with carbon capture.\"\n\nRyan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips (COP.N), spoke about the impact of climate change in Alaska, where his company is the largest oil producer. \"I've seen the glaciers melting,\" he said.\n\nJohn Hess, CEO of Hess Corp (HES.N), North Dakota's third-largest oil producer, called climate change a \"serious problem.\"\n\n\"The world needs more energy, but it needs less CO2.

The company launched its Model X last September.\n\nWhile other automakers have invested in hydrogen fuel cell technology, Straubel said he doesn't see hydrogen as a threat.\n\nThere remain \"fundamental problems\" with hydrogen as a fuel source, he said, as limited infrastructure inhibits it from being sustainable and cost-efficient.\n\nLithium, which he said only makes up a small percentage of the lithium ion battery packs that power Tesla's vehicles, is abundant and could even be extracted from sea water in the future, he said.\n\nCosts of batteries also continue to decline by improving how batteries are built to enhance their storage capacity and by building batteries on a larger scale.\n\nTo support the number of vehicles Tesla envisions it will sell, the company's Gigafactory - under construction in Nevada and scheduled to begin production later this year in a partnership with Panasonic - will be the biggest battery factory in the world, Straubel said. Electric motor costs also are declining.\n\n\"Basically every single part of that electric vehicle ecosystem is dropping substantially, he said.", "INDIANAPOLIS -- Automakers who sell their products directly to customers, such as Tesla Motors Inc., can continue in Indiana after a Senate panel backed down from banning the practice Thursday.\n\nThe Commerce and Technology Committee voted unanimously to strip an amendment to bar direct sales and study the issue more.\n\nCommittee chairman James Buck said he received phone calls of \"incivility\" from opponents of the proposed ban on direct sales.\n\nThe ban is contrary to traditional free market philosophies of the Republican lawmakers who dominate the Legislature.

Better for the stock would be if the ailing retailer addressed some of the things that have hobbled its business -- and its share price.\n\nIn the annual letter that the company released along with fourth-quarter results Thursday, the chairman, chief executive and majority owner of the company recounted how many other retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores WMT 1.37 % and Macy's, M 1.21 % had a tough time in 2015. Repeating something Sears noted earlier this month when it flagged weak results, he said that unusually warm weather had weighed on apparel sales in November and December.\n\nMr. Lampert also said that new companies, such as Uber, are having a far easier time raising money, despite losses, than established players. And some, like Tesla Motors, TSLA 4.71 % also benefit from government subsidies, he wrote.\n\nMoreover, he complains that for years, Amazon.com AMZN 0.20 % was able to grow rapidly and not collect sales tax, \"while traditional retail companies had the dual disadvantages of having to report profits and to collect sales tax from their customers.\" Higher minimum-wage costs are another burden for Sears.\n\nBut for the small pool of investors left in the stock, the things Sears can't change aren't so much the issue. More pressing is a lack of investment and falloff in business that has caused its stock to decline by more than 50% over the past years.\n\nAny hope of reversing that will depend on Sears showing that it can change itself into a company that will be viable over the long term.

They Want Their Car Back\n\nWhile Tesla Motors officially started delivering the Model X all-electric crossover utility vehicle last September, there are still only a few hundred of the cars in the hands of their customers, mostly in the United States, with several thousand reservations and orders for the car still pending. Tesla has not officially released the exact number of advance reservations for the Model X, but estimates in online forums (based on the reservation numbers reported by forum members over the past four years) run as high as 30,000 or more before accounting for cancellations. For a car that sells for anywhere from $80,000 to $152,000, that's an impressive feat. It should also bring in a hefty amount of income for the company when these reservations convert to confirmed orders, and from there to delivered cars later this year.\n\nHowever, not all of these thousands of reservations have converted to confirmed orders. Apparently some people actually want to see the car in person -- maybe even drive one -- before converting their refundable $5,000 (production) or $40,000 (Signature) deposit into a non-refundable order. \u00c2 But with so few Model X cars available -- and virtually none in Tesla's stores -- getting hands-on with a Model X has been tricky.\n\nTo remedy this situation, Tesla is bringing a fleet of Model X cars around the U.S. and Canada, allowing reservations holders to check out the X in person: play with those unique Falcon Wing Doors, take in the view of the massive panoramic windshield and experience the thrill of a \"Ludicrous Speed\" launch. This event, called \"Meet Model X\" came through Manhattan and Syosset, NY this past week and it gave me a chance to get behind the wheel of this decidedly futuristic car.\n\nAfter a quick tutorial from my Tesla co-pilot, we pulled out of the lot and onto the back street where the Syosset Tesla store is located. We switched the car over to \"Ludicrous Speed\" and I punched that go pedal hard. Wooohooooo! We were pressed back into our seats as the road melted away behind us. It was just as exhilarating as the first time I test drove a Tesla P85+ a few years ago. But the fact that a 6000-pound 7-seat SUV could have the same effect continues to amaze me. Tesla says the Model X P90D with Ludicrous Speed upgrade will do 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, and I have no reason to believe they're wrong. This makes it the quickest production SUV ever made. It even beats many dedicated 2-seater super cars. But it can fit a family of seven plus their gear and also tow a boat or medium-sized trailer (up to 5,000 pounds).\n\nAnd as fast as the Model X is, I never felt that I was not in control. Whether speeding down that deserted street, merging onto the highway, or exiting said highway in a tight curve, the car's low center of gravity and responsive steering made it feel as if we were glued to the road.\n\n\"We Have Assumed Control\"\n\nThe Model X also handled surprisingly well when my hands were off the wheel. While on the highway I tapped the stalk under the steering wheel twice to engage \"Auto-Pilot\" mode. With auto-pilot engaged, the Model X steers for you, keeping you in your lane and also maintains a safe distance from the car in front of you. Its built-in cameras even read speed limit signs and can adjust your speed accordingly, to prevent you from getting any tickets. And this is probably a good thing. Because the ride on the Model X is so smooth that it's easy to break into 3-digit speeds without event trying (ahem, \"from what I've heard\").\n\nBack at the Tesla store, we were able to check out some of the unique features of the Model X. Pressing the keyfob or tapping the rear door handle sets the Falcon Wing Doors in motion. These are different from traditional \"gull wing\" doors in that they have two hinges instead of one. These two independent hinges as well as integrated sensors allow the doors to open even in very tight parking spaces. If the car detects a large object next to it (like another car), the falcon wing doors will change their opening arc to avoid the obstruction, opening up and then outward instead of outward, then up. And if you stand too close to a falcon wing door, it will simply stop, rather than smack you in the face.\n\nOnce the Falcon Wing Doors are open, accessing the third row seat can be done a couple of ways: in a seven-seat configuration, pressing the button on the back of the outer middle seat moves the outer and middle seats in the third row forward and tilts them out of the way allowing passengers to walk right into the rear seat. In a six-seat configuration, you can do the same thing, or you can simply enter the rear seat from the middle row, passing through the space between the two middle seats. Once in the rear row of a seven-seater, things can feel a little tight back there (at least for this 6-foot tall writer) due to the high seat backs of the middle row in front of you and the relatively low headroom. But switching over to a 6-seat configuration opens up the space considerably and also gives rear seat passengers a peak through that massive front windshield as well as some additional leg room. The windshield goes back much further than in a regular car, making it feel almost like you're touring around in a glass-walled helicopter.\n\nThe front doors are also very clever. They detect your approach to the car (or, to be precise, they detect the key fob in your pocket approaching the car) and they open out automatically to allow you to get in. Like the falcon wing doors, the front doors include sensors to avoid contact with people or other objects. Once in the driver's seat, simply tap the brake pedal to close both the driver's and front passenger's doors automatically.\n\n\"These All Go to Eleven\"\n\nWe also checked out the HiFi system (it goes to 11, natch), which comes with such niceties as TuneIn Internet Radio, FM, Slacker, Sirius/XM (upgraded system only) and Pandora. What it lacks is AM radio which we're told is due to the EM interference on the AM band caused by electric motors. BMW's i3 EV lacks the AM band for the same reason. If you're fond of particular AM radio stations for news, sports, weather or traffic, chances are you can find the internet radio streaming versions via TuneIn internet radio and you can plug those in as favorites. The Model X comes with free 4G LTE service in the car for the first four years so you won't have to worry about your internet connection in most areas of the globe where you're likely to drive one. You can also connect the car to your phone's mobile hotspot or your home WiFi for software updates or internet access.\n\nJust for fun, we fired up the \"bioweapon defense\" mode on the climate control system. This mode pumps the cabin air through dual activated carbon filters as well as a HEPA grade particulate filter. It also cranks the fan to eleven (Musk must really like \"Spinal Tap\"). While driving, the whir of the fans wasn't even noticeable though we could hear it when the car was stopped. The system was designed to provide \"hospital grade\" air quality inside, while the air outside may be somewhat less than ideal. This should make the car very popular in China (and certain parts of New Jersey).\n\nReluctantly, I had to say goodbye to the Model X as the next driver in the queue approached. Overall, my hands-on experience with the Model X just reinforced my opinion of this car. It's a glimpse of what cars will be like in the future, but it's available now (or at least, \"soon\" for current reservation holders). If you can afford the price tag, put in your order and you're in for a treat. Depending on which configuration you choose, you could be waiting for a few months or even up to a year. Confirmed orders for the top of the line P90D version are shipping first, followed by the non-performance 90D model, followed by the smaller battery (and lower range) 70D model. Features like the panoramic windshield and falcon wing doors are standard on all models while auto-opening front doors and bioweapon defense mode are optional features. You can check out our complete Model X Buyers Guide for details on options and pricing.\n\nThe \"Meet Model X\" event is still making its way across the country but is currently open to Model X reservation holders only. Tesla expects to have the Model X available in showrooms for the general public to test drive later this year.", "SPARKS, Nevada -- Hundreds of union construction workers walked off the job at Tesla Motors' battery manufacturing plant in northern Nevada on Monday to protest what union organizers say is the increased hiring of out-of-state workers for less pay.\n\nApproximately 350 plumbers, carpenters, electricians, painters and others walked away from the construction site Monday along U.S. Interstate 80 about 25 miles east of Reno, said Russell James, District 16 business development specialist for the Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada.\n\nMore than 100 picketed outside the main gate against what they say is an unfair labor practice that undermines promises to hire mostly Nevada workers in exchange for more than $1 billion in state tax breaks, James said.\n\n\"It's corporate welfare at its worst,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nUnion officials said work at Tesla's gigafactory is increasingly being done by crews for the non-union, New Mexico-based Brycon Corp.\n\n\"Nevada's tax dollars should be used to provide jobs for Nevada construction workers, not New Mexico construction workers,\" said Ted Koch, president of the northern Nevada council.\n\nTesla said in a statement that the electric car-maker is in compliance with all state requirements.

The key, he says, is to make the impossible possible.\n\n\"The client has an objective and there are always limitations on any job -- time, cost, access -- and it seems to me that other craftsmen throw out reasons why they cannot take a project on\", Morgan told BCCJ ACUMEN. \"But I've always enjoyed taking on that extra layer of challenge to a job.\n\n\"I've learned to think on my feet, to be flexible and -- when you're working with a bunch of contractors in a confined space and in 30 degree-plus summer heat -- how to keep my cool\".\n\nOriginally from Plumstead, south London, Morgan set up his firm, Horizon, near Tokyo in 2014. Japan was not, however, where he expected to be working. And carpentry was not a trade he planned to take up.\n\n\"I left school early because I wanted to make money, and I never took my A Levels\", he said. \"I worked for the Midland Bank for four years, but I was always into music and I started doing some DJing work\".\n\nOut of the blue, that led to a temporary DJing tour of Japan in 1993. The promoters were so pleased with the reaction that they asked him to come back for a six-month tour.\n\n\"Against my parents' advice, I packed up and came to Japan\", he said.\n\nThe Tokyo music scene began to pale after a few years and Morgan decided he wanted to do something more hands-on, more creative.\n\n\"My dad was a brickie, gas-fitter and plumber, and my brother still fits double-glazing, so there's a tradition in the family\", he said. Nevertheless, all the skills he has today were self-taught.\n\n\"I started by doing odd jobs for Kathryn Milan, an American who ran an antiques business based in a beautiful Taisho-era house in Nishi-Azabu\", he said. \"The work was a bit of everything, including repairing old cabinets and basketwork, but that soon grew into making furniture.\n\n\"Then someone asked if I could lay a floor\", he added. \"I'd never even tried before, but I saw it as a challenge and went with it. And that is how I have learned\".\n\nMorgan's burgeoning reputation and word-of-mouth recommendations mean he has never had to advertise for work. In fact, the opposite is the problem; there is too much work and not enough skilled and capable craftsmen to meet the demand.\n\n\"I'm always shocked at how few people are taking up traditional skills in Japan today\", he said. \"Although that does mean there is no shortage of work for reliable and capable craftsmen\".\n\nFor Morgan, there can be fewer jobs that are more satisfying than standing back when a project is completed and admiring the finished product.\n\nTo date, projects have run the gamut from straightforward interior restorations -- and plenty that were less straightforward -- to working on bespoke furniture, graphic installations, and general maintenance and exterior restoration projects, such as beach houses and wooden decks.\n\nClients also cross the spectrum, ranging from Syn Entertainment in Tokyo, for whom he created office interiors, to The Body Shop in Okinawa, Apple in Fukuoka, Tesla Motors Japan, Yoga Jaya, Waseda International School and Tokyo International Kindercare.\n\nMorgan insists that one of his greatest joys is pottering around in his workshop, less than 10 minutes on foot from his self-renovated home overlooking the town of Hayama, southwest of Tokyo.\n\n\"I can't compete with Ikea on price, but every customer knows that they are getting a one-of-a-kind, custom-built piece of furniture\", he said.\n\nOn the day of BCCJ ACUMEN's visit, he is putting the finishing touches to a corner storage unit, complete with integral fish tank, for an international kindergarten in Tokyo. Child-friendly, the corners are rounded and the colours are eye-catching. Morgan is nearing his \"euphoric moment\".\n\n\"It's always a work in progress until its in place and everything is just so\", he said. \"But then you stand back and you've got it right. And that feels good\".", "Scott Sonner / AP\n\nFraming of Tesla Motors' new factory under construction is visible June 14, 2015, behind the security gate on Electric Avenue at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center about 15 miles east of Sparks along U.S. Interstate 80.\n\nBy Scott Sonner, Associated Press\n\nMonday, Feb. 29, 2016 | 12:45 p.m.\n\nSPARKS -- Union organizers say hundreds of construction workers walked off the job at the Tesla Motors manufacturing plant east of Reno to protest the increased hiring of out-of-state workers for less pay.\n\nDistrict 16 trades council spokesman Russell James says approximately 350 plumbers, carpenters, electricians and others walked away from the construction site Monday morning.\n\nMore than 100 picketed outside the main gate against what they say is an unfair labor practice that undermines promises to hire mostly Nevada workers in exchange for more than $1 billion in state tax breaks.\n\nJames says the work is increasingly being done by crews for the non-union, New Mexico-based Bycon Corp.\n\nTesla said in a statement it's in compliance with requirements that Nevadans make up more than three-fourths of the entire \"gigafactory\" workforce and more than half of the individual contractors.", "Union organizers say hundreds of construction workers walked off the job at the Tesla Motors manufacturing plant east of Reno to protest the increased hiring of out-of-state workers for less pay.\n\nDistrict 16 trades council spokesman Russell James says approximately 350 plumbers, carpenters, electricians and others walked away from the construction site Monday morning.\n\nMore than 100 picketed outside the main gate against what they say is an unfair labor practice that undermines promises to hire mostly Nevada workers in exchange for more than $1 billion in state tax breaks.\n\nJames says the work is increasingly being done by crews for the non-union, New Mexico-based Bycon Corp.\n\nTesla said in a statement it's in compliance with requirements that Nevadans make up more than three-fourths of the entire \"gigafactory\" workforce and more than half of the individual contractors.", "SPARKS, Nev.

Video by Courtney Pedroza/azcentral.com | The Arizona Republic\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSpeeding down the freeway, I almost can't bring myself to do it. But the Tesla Motors employee sitting next to me ensures me it's totally safe.\n\nSo reluctantly, I take my hands off the wheel and my foot off the accelerator, then start laughing spontaneously as the red, electric Model S P90D guides itself down the 101 in Scottsdale.\n\nI am testing the Tesla autopilot feature, rolled out last fall and now a standard hardware feature on the Model S. The car starts at $70,000 but the model we drove, with 90-kilowatt battery and dual motors, has an entry-level price of $108,000. Enabling the autopilot costs $2,500.\n\nIt's lunchtime, so there is traffic, and we're doing about 70 miles per hour to keep up with it. Everything seems OK at first. The road is straight. The car stays within the lanes and maintains its speed. Autopilot so far feels pretty much like cruise control on a traditional vehicle. Then there's a curve ahead. We are in the middle lane with cars on both sides. I catch myself subconsciously holding my breath as I put my faith in Tesla CEO Elon Musk's technology to keep me, a photographer and the Tesla spokeswoman from causing a 10-car pileup.\n\nHeading into the curve, the car barely drifts a foot toward the outside of the curve before picking up on the lane marker and smoothly turning the wheel to stay in the lane. Traffic slows in front of the car, and it slows to match it. Traffic opens up, and it accelerates back to the speed it was set at when autopilot was engaged.\n\nRyan Randazzo keeps his hands near the steering wheel as he tests the self-driving car technology in the Tesla Model S P90D in Scottsdale, Ariz. on Feb 26, 2016.

It also has a long-distance radar and forward facing radar to help it decide when to slow down and when to speed up. A screen on the consul depicts what the car is \"seeing\" ahead, showing the car itself and those around it. In a Utopian vision of the future, all the other vehicles are depicted as Teslas except large trucks and motorcycles.\n\nIf you lose confidence in the autopilot, all you have to do is tap the brake or turn the wheel and the car is back under your full control. Engaging the autopilot takes two quick clicks of a turn-signal-like lever behind the wheel. The feature is best for highway or freeway driving because so far, the cars don't recognize stop signs or signals, meaning drivers would have to disengage and re-engage the feature frequently if driving on side streets. Tesla's autopilot can also be used to park the car or use a remote control on the key to back it out of a tight space where other vehicles haven't left enough room to open the door.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are coming\n\nAutonomous vehicles are under development by both traditional automakers such as Ford (which will demonstrate its technology being developed in Wittman this week in Phoenix) and tech companies like Google. But Tesla is unique in rolling out new software updates much like iPhones, and letting Tesla owners download and test out each upgrade.\n\nAs we approach an off-ramp, I'm daydreaming of what Musk's conversations with his attorneys must sound like when they discuss letting people beta test self-driving cars. We are in the right lane and the lane marker on the right side of the road curves off down the ramp. I'm afraid the car will follow it off the freeway.\n\n\"...letting a car steer itself is akin to taking your hands off your bike's handlebars for the first time, or taking your first breath underwater from a SCUBA tank.\"\n\nSonja Koch, the Tesla spokeswoman giving me the demonstration, assures me that the newest software in the Tesla will \"probably\" keep the car driving along the freeway and not take the exit.\n\nThe car also will perform lane changes while in autopilot if the driver simply hits the turn signal indicator. But it won't move over if there is someone in the blind spot. It's because of these \"probably\" situations that Tesla advises drivers keep their hands on the wheel and foot near the brake, and don't fully disengage from operating the car while it's in autopilot. If the car totally loses sense of its surroundings, it will alert the driver to take control. If that doesn't happen, the car will slow itself to a stop. Our car made a slight move toward the off-ramp, then, apparently, picked up on the lane marker down the road beyond the ramp and returned to the center of the lane.\n\nAfter about two miles of letting the car drive itself, it's clear the Tesla has less of a problem with this task than I do. By the end of a half-hour drive, I trusted the vehicle much more than when I first engaged the autopilot. Still, letting a car steer itself is akin to taking your hands off your bike's handlebars for the first time, or taking your first breath underwater from a SCUBA tank.\n\nThe feature might be a good way for Tesla drivers to avoid multiple speeding tickets, because the snappy acceleration offers a constant temptation to let it fly. Car and Driver magazine verified the 0-60 time of 2.8 seconds for the $10,000 \"Ludicrous Speed\" upgrade of the Model S. The Arizona Republic did not.

Many were hoping to purchase it in the popular red/maroon color option often offered by the company on its vehicles.\n\nAs reported by The Motley Fool, Tesla CTO J.B. Straubel announced that the Tesla Model 3 will come loaded with \"next generation\" Tesla technology. He also mentioned that the vehicle will be similar in size to Audi's A4.\n\nSome analysts are speculating that the \"next generation\" technology mentioned may involve the use of a new suite of cameras and sensors that will help to facilitate the vehicle's ability to function as a self-driving car. Others project that Straubel simply may have been referring to the fact that Tesla has mentioned in the past that the Model 3 will be built on a different platform from the Model S and Model X.\n\nTesla is hoping that the introduction of the Tesla Model 3 will boost its sales significantly, from roughly 80,000 to 90,000 in 2016 to a whopping 500,000 by 2020.\n\nTesla Motors is an American-based company that specializes in a combined technology of automotive design and energy storage.

The founding family has pushed back against any changes to the company's governance, he said.\n\nA key member of the family, Bombardier's previous Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin, launched three different plane programs at about the same time and the resulting draining of the company's cash is a major reason for its current problems.\n\nThe investment model, proposed by Quebec and supported by Bombardier, would give the federal and provincial governments a combined four seats - provided Canada matches the province's $1 billion investment - on the seven person CSeries board, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\nBombardier itself would only be able to nominate three of the seats, putting the company's representatives in a minority.\n\nOn Thursday, Quebec Transport Minister Jacques Daoust confirmed the Reuters story during an interview on Canada's RDI television.\n\n\"If we had a new player joining us, we could imagine having seven board seats,\" Daoust said. \"The new partner and us would control the company. This is certainly a scenario that is being explored now, because we couldn't imagine investing two-thirds of the funds and having a minority on the decision-making front.\"\n\nQuebec has argued that the governments' majority position on the CSeries board should assuage federal concerns over the company's governance.\n\nThe governments would act as shareholders and not participate in the day-to-day operations of the plane program, one of the sources said. The deal would also allow Bombardier to buy back the governments' shares in the CSeries at a later date, as is already the case with the agreement between Bombardier and Quebec.\n\n\"The last thing you want are governments to run the program,\" said the second source. A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment.\n\nBombardier received a boost in February when the company secured its first order in 16 months. That was for up to 75 CSeries jets to be supplied to Air Canada.\n\nBombardier has faced fierce competition from plane-making rivals Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) which have adapted new engines to their respective narrow-body jets. That has helped them compete with the fuel-efficient CSeries.\n\nThey have also been able to undercut Bombardier's pricing by discounting their older Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 models, which are late in their life cycles and can be built at a comparatively lower cost.\n\n(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha in Toronto, David Ljunggren in Ottawa and Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Amran Abocar and Martin Howell)", "Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in 2012, Louis Chenevert.\n\nWith Honeywell's stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants.\n\nThe idea was not new.

United Technologies responded hours later with its own public filing rejecting the deal and reiterating its concerns about any combination being able to survive regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHoneywell said its offer, which it first made privately last week, valued United Technologies at about $108 a share, including $42.63 in cash and 0.614 of a Honeywell share. The Wall Street Journal had reported terms of the offer earlier this week, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBut its 10-page presentation doesn't address how Honeywell would surmount what United Technologies says is the primary obstacle--the likely objections of antitrust regulators to the combination of two major aerospace equipment suppliers.\n\nIn a letter released to investors Friday, United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes repeatedly pointed to regulatory risk, saying the merger wouldn't get approved due to an environment that \"is the most aggressive toward megadeals in decades.\" Even if a deal were approved, he argued that the required delays and divestitures would far outweigh any benefits and potential synergies.\n\nThe company was dismissive, too, of the deal's structure, which would use some cash from United Technologies' balance sheet to fund the transaction. \"Effectively Honeywell's proposal is a leveraged buyout of UTC using UTC's own strong balance sheet,\" Mr. Hayes wrote.\n\nHoneywell believes that any objection from regulators in the U.S. or Europe could be dealt with through relatively simple divestitures. Aerospace businesses where the two companies currently overlap, like production of electrical power units for aircraft, could be sold off to satisfy government concerns about creating a monopoly.\n\nOne major investor in both companies said the merger wouldn't be as difficult to complete as United Technologies and Mr. Hayes suggest.\n\n\"It seems to me there could be a path to approval,\" said Tobias Welo, portfolio manager for Fidelity Management & Research Co., which is the eighth-largest shareholder at United Technologies and 11th-largest at Honeywell.\n\n\"In industrials, there's a path forward if you're willing to divest the assets,\" Mr. Welo said. \"You just have to make sure the deal still makes economic sense.\"\n\nThis week, Honeywell CEO David Cote has been on the road, including visiting with investors in Boston to make his case on the merits of the deal. Mr. Welo said Honeywell is taking a similar tack to other industrial companies that have used a year of slumping valuations as an opportunity to snap up competitors at low prices.\n\nUnited Technologies has pushed the opposite case, focusing especially on the mammoth customers most likely to oppose a merger of key aerospace suppliers: Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. On Wednesday, both plane-makers expressed reservations about the potential merger.\n\nUnited Technologies said the two companies are head-to-head competitors in many aerospace and building systems business lines, pointing to small and medium aircraft engines, wheels and lighting, among others.\n\nOn Friday, United Technologies warned that U.S. and European regulators aren't the only ones who would have to bless the merger. China in particular could prove a challenge, since the country might require that some aerospace assets be sold to a Chinese buyer. Such a sale could trigger its own national security review in the U.S., the company suggested.\n\nIn its presentation, Honeywell said the combined company will have \"highly complementary\" offerings that also have limited overlap. According to Honeywell, potential regulatory issues would be \"easily resolved.\"\n\nHoneywell argues that a combined company would retain an investment-grade credit rating, another nod to possible shareholder concerns. And it makes clear that what was discussed months ago as a merger of equals is now a takeover. Honeywell's Mr. Cote would run the new company as both chairman and chief executive.\n\nShares of Honeywell fell 1.1% to $103.03, while United Technologies slipped 38 cents to $97.69.\n\nWrite to Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com and Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-26-161749ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines Referenced Stocks: HON , UTX", "Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in 2012, Louis Chenevert.\n\nWith Honeywell's stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants.\n\nThe idea was not new.

Inc. has suffered a fresh problem during testing of new aircraft engines for the Airbus A320neo, but flight trials of the latest version of Europe's best-selling airliner are continuing, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe problem occurred when an oil pump failed after an engine had been deliberately shut down in flight and left to turn with the natural airflow, a process known as \"windmilling,\" which is designed to ensure an aircraft can fly on only one engine.\n\n\"We found a bearing had seized within the main oil pump. We have never seen that anywhere in flight tests,\" an industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nPratt & Whitney is carrying out an internal investigation into the problem which happened about two weeks ago.

In the worst-case scenario, such problems could force airlines to use an extra pilot, two industry sources said. However, Pratt has said it will fix the problem by June.\n\nAirbus is meanwhile repairing an A321neo variant powered by engines from Pratt's competitor CFM International, which suffered a tail strike on one of its first flights this month.\n\nThe A321neo was making a steeper than normal descent in an exercise commonly used for safety testing, according to airport sources. Airbus says it should return to service within weeks.\n\nThe incident surprised some industry observers because the aircraft's flight control system would usually prevent the tail scraping the runway. Airbus said the problem would not affect the timetable for flight testing and certification.\n\nQatar Airways last week threatened to cancel an order for Pratt & Whitney engines for the A320neo.

United Technologies responded hours later with its own slideshow and reiterated its concerns about any deal being able to survive regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHoneywell said its deal valued United at about $108 a share, or about $90.7 billion, in a combined stock-and-cash offer using share prices as of Feb. 18. The offer would have given United shareholders $42.63 a share in cash along with 0.614 share of Honeywell. The Wall Street Journal had reported terms of the offer earlier this week, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBut the 10-page presentation doesn't address how Honeywell would surmount what United Technologies says is the primary obstacle to a merger--the likely objections of antitrust regulators to the combination of two major aerospace equipment suppliers.\n\nUnited on Friday repeatedly pointed to regulatory risk, saying the merger wouldn't get approved due to a regulatory environment that \"is the most aggressive toward megadeals in decades.\"\n\nIt further said that if it was approved, the downsides of the required delays and divestitures would far outweigh any benefits and potential synergies.\n\nPeople familiar with Honeywell's thinking have said the company believes that any objection from regulators in the U.S. or Europe could be dealt with through divestitures. Aerospace businesses where the two companies currently overlap, like production of electrical power units for aircraft, could be sold off to satisfy government concerns about creating a monopoly.\n\nOn Wednesday, two big aerospace customers, Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co., expressed reservations about the potential merger.\n\nIn its presentation, Honeywell said the combined company will have \"highly complementary\" offerings that also have limited overlap. According to Honeywell, potential regulatory issues would be \"easily resolved.\"\n\nUnited said the two companies are head-to-head competitors in many aerospace and building systems business lines, pointing to small and medium aircraft engines, wheels and lighting, among others.\n\nThe presentation argues that a combined company would retain an investment grade credit rating, another nod to possible shareholder concerns. And it makes clear that what was discussed months ago as a merger of equals is now a takeover. Honeywell CEO Dave Cote would run the new company as both chairman and chief executive.\n\nShares of Honeywell recently edged down 40 cents to $103.79, while United Technologies shares rose 83 cents to $ 98.90.\n\nHoneywell said Friday that it estimates the deal will have about $3.5 billion in cost synergies realized by the fourth year of operations. The company said much of the estimated savings will come from more leverage in prices due to higher volumes and benefits such as consolidating real estate and contract manufacturing. Honeywell estimates the combined company will have about $97 billion in annual sales.\n\nUnited, though, said the deal also undervalues the company and overvalues the synergies.\n\n\"Effectively Honeywell's proposal is a leveraged buyout of UTC using UTC's own strong balance sheet,\" United wrote, referring to itself by its stock symbol.\n\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com and Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-26-161444ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines Referenced Stocks: HON , UTX", "REUTERS: U.S. industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp on Friday rejected a US$90.7 billion offer by rival aerospace supplier Honeywell International Inc, saying that pursuing a merger would be \"irresponsible\" toward its shareholders.\n\n\"We concluded that a combination would be blocked outright or, even if it were possible to complete a transaction, the regulatory delay, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions would ultimately destroy shareholder value far beyond any synergies,\" United Technologies said in a regulatory filing.\n\n\"It would be irresponsible for UTC to move forward with the proposed combination,\" it said.\n\nHoneywell said earlier on Friday it has offered to buy United Technologies Corp for about US$90.7 billion, putting pressure on the reluctant aerospace supplier to come to the negotiating table.\n\nA combined company would have almost US$100 billion in annual sales, and double-digit earnings growth after they slash costs, according to a presentation by Honeywell Chief Executive Officer David Cote to United Tech's top executives last week and made public Friday.\n\nUnited Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average , turned lower in afternoon trading, down 0.8 percent to US$97.36.

Thales reported net attributable profit of \u20ac809 million ($883.4 million), up 44 percent from \u20ac562 million in the previous year.\n\nAround the Arabian Gulf and Middle East, southeast Asia, particularly around South China sea, \"there is a sustained investment drive for security, which is the highest priority,\" he said. That defense and domestic security concern outweighs the plunge in the oil price.\n\nThere is \"a tipping point\" in Thales' traditional market in Western countries with Britain, France and Germany -- the three largest defense budgets in Europe -- increasing spending, while smaller nations such as Poland also are raising expenditure, he said.\n\n\"That creates a number of opportunities, either for the defense market or related security,\" he said. Growth in mature markets came after years of sales stagnation since 2009.\n\nAustralia's tender, worth AU$ 50 billion ($35.87 billion) for up to 12 attack submarines in the Project Sea 1000 program, is a big prospect. Thales sees potential gains as its local subsidiary could act as an Australian supplier, independent of the authorities picking Lockheed Martin or Raytheon to act as combat system integrator on the boat.\n\nIf DCNS won the tender to design and build the boat, Thales stands to benefit as the latter holds a 35 percent stake in the former and supplies its sonars. DCNS competes with Japan, partnered with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Shipbuilding, and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. The separate selections of submarine builder and combat system integrator are expected this summer.\n\nDEFENSE NEWS\n\nAirbus CEO: Sale of Defense Electronics Business Is Near\n\nThere is another potential Australian contract, the next step in merging air traffic management of civil and military aviation, a technically demanding deal worth more than \u20ac100 million.\n\nOptical and communications military satellites for Middle Eastern countries are among further prospective sales. A contract to design and build a French intermediate frigate is expected this year.\n\nA sale of the Rafale to India is a possible deal this year, and there are negotiations between Dassault and United Arab Emirates for the fighter.\n\nLast year, Thales won five \"very large\" orders worth more than \u20ac500 million, chief finance officer Pascal Bouchiat said. These included the contract signed jointly with Airbus Defense & Space for the French new generation military communications satellite Comsat NG, Rafale fighter sale to Egypt and Qatar, and Hawkei troop carrier for Australia.\n\nThales hopes to deliver profitable growth as the company pursues a mid-term target of 10 percent operating profit margin by 2018.\n\nThales reported a record 2015 operating profit of \u20ac1.2 billion, above the \u20ac1 billion figure for the first time, up 23 percent from \u20ac985 million in the previous year. Sales rose 8 percent to \u20ac14.1 billion from \u20ac12.9 billion. Cashflow doubled to \u20ac1.1 billion, as down payments on orders soared.\n\nThe biggest deal was a signaling system worth more than \u20ac1 billion for the London Underground. That transport deal reflected the importance of civil deals, which make up some 50 percent of Thales' sales. That contract was a key element for the future, Caine said, while arms deals delivered a solid business base and strong support came from defense ministries, particularly in France.\n\nOn the Watchkeeper, Caine declined to comment on losing the French tender to the Sagem Patroller, but he said there was \"additional work\" worth \u00a3100 million signed a few weeks ago for the tactical drone in service with the British Army. There were also many sales prospects.\n\nDCNS contributed \u20ac22 million in earnings after a loss for Thales of \u20ac117 million in the previous year, due to the 35 percent stake.\n\nDCNS said Feb. 22 among the priorities this year were winning the Australian submarine contract, contracts for the French intermediate frigate and a maintenance program on the nuclear ballistic missile submarine.\n\nThe naval company will deliver Languedoc, the fourth multimission frigate and prepare for a major overhaul of the Charles de Gaulle nuclear powered aircraft carrier. DCNS will also deliver the two Mistral helicopter carriers to Egypt, previously sold to Russia and bought back under the western arms embargo.\n\nA cost cutting drive and sale of the Mistrals and a multimission frigate to Egypt helped turn round DCNS, which reported a 2014 loss.\n\nDCNS reported net profit of \u20ac58.4 million after a loss of \u20ac347 million, on sales of \u20ac3.03 billion compared to \u20ac3.07 billion. Orders slipped to \u20ac3.52 billion from \u20ac3.60 billion. The company reached an agreement to pull out the Jules Horowitz nuclear civil reactor program, which had contributed to the 2014 loss.\n\nEmail: achuter@defensenews.com\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://defnews.ly/1QKYor1", "Republic Airways Holdings Corp., says it plans to streamline its operations by operating only Embraer E170 regional jets, putting the future of the biggest single order for Bombardier Inc. C Series jets into grave doubt.\n\nThe airline holding company was scheduled to be the North American launch customer for the CS300, the larger of two C Series models, with planes that were scheduled to be delivered last year. Republic filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York Thursday. The company operates feeder airlines for such U.S. giants as Delta Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines.\n\nThe Bombardier C Series program is more than two years behind its scheduled initial delivery date of the end of 2013 and more than $2-billion (U.S.) over its original budget of $3.4-billion.\n\nThe Republic order for 40 CS300 planes worth more than $3-billion at list prices represents 16 per cent of the 243 firm orders Bombardier has for the high-tech, fuel-efficient aircraft, which is now scheduled to go into service in the second half of this year.\n\nIn court filings, Republic said it has not secured financing for the C Series purchases.\n\n\"In regard, to the CS300 commitments, due to the manufacturer's delivery delays and general uncertainty, no financing commitments have been entered into,\" Republic chief executive officer Bryan Bedford said in a statement filed with the New York bankruptcy court.\n\nThe restructuring plan calls for Republic to simplify \"its operational fleet by transitioning to a single, larger regional jet fleet and a single operating certificate and assuring sufficient liquidity to support its operations and future growth,\" Mr. Bedford said. The airline said in the filing that it would seek to streamline its operations by operating Embraer 170/175 aircraft.\n\nUtilizing the C Series would require an additional operating certificate, which appears to indicate that Republic is planning for a future that does not include the C Series, one industry source Friday.\n\nBombardier Commercial Aircraft spokeswoman Marianella de la Barrera said Republic's C Series order stands. \"What we can say is that Republic's order is intact and we don't see an immediate impact to the order.\"\n\nThe airline's restructuring plan also includes what Republic said is an early return or settlement of claims for \"out of favour aircraft\" which it identified as Bombardier's Q400 turboprop planes and smaller Embraer regional jets the E145. It wasn't immediately clear whether Bombardier would have any obligations as part of that effort.\n\nThe C Series program received a boost from Air Canada last week, when the flag carrier signed a letter of intent that included 45 firm orders for the CS300 and 75 options. The Republic order included 40 options.\n\nThe Air Canada order was the first new order in almost 15 months for the C Series, which is taking on Boeing Co. and Airbus in the 100-seat to 150-seat segment of the narrow body commercial jet market.\n\nThe two giants based in Chicago and Europe respectively, have dominated the single-aisle market with their 737 and A320 families of aircraft and have fought back against the attempted incursion by Bombardier.\n\nRepublic was already considered an \"at-risk customer\" for the C Series and it had stopped making pre-delivery deposit payments on the planes, Desjardins Capital Markets analyst Benoit Poirier said in a note Friday.\n\n\"We expect the bankruptcy protection filing to raise questions among investors over Republic Airways' ability to fund the planned CS300 purchase,\" Mr. Poirier said, adding the airline had early delivery slots for its order.", "On Thursday morning, I found myself staring, in intimate detail, at the pores and sweat droplets of a stubbly Tom Cruise. No, we're not good friends. What I saw was a demonstration of the new IMAX with laser upgrade at the Air and Space Museum's Lockheed Martin Theater.\n\nI spoke at length last month with Zarth Bertsch, Director of Smithsonian Theaters, about the upcoming conversion. Bertsch told me, \"We have really waited until the optimal convergence, and laser is the first significant fundamental change or improvement in digital technology since the advent of digital projection.\" At yesterday's demo of the upgraded system, IMAX Chief Quality Officer David Keighley, who boasts that, \"we are the Lamborghini of the motion picture business,\" had similar words for the new technology. \"I never thought I'd see anything as good as 70mm film.\"\n\nMe neither. I attended one of the last screenings of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 15-perf 70mm at Air and Space, and while I will continue to promote area screenings of 35mm and especially 70mm prints, it behooves me to tell readers what patrons of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center's Airbus IMAX Theater in Centreville already know: you have to see this system.\n\nThis year is the 40th anniversary of the Air and Space Museum's IMAX theatre and of To Fly, the film that launched the auditorium (it has continued to play there for the past four decades, making it the longest running documentary in the world). Keighley included a restored version of \"To Fly\" in his demo, as well as more recent IMAX offerings like Born to Be Wild (baby animals in IMAX 3D ... call the kids!) and Rocky Mountain Express, \" which uses the latest technology on an iconic image that goes back to the dawn of cinema: the locomotive.\n\nThe IMAX laser technology offers a clarity and tonal range so rich that I'd be happy to see the phone book projected in this format. I did see its cinematic equivalent: a color test chart. I heard the roar of airplanes and race cars to show off the improved 12-channel sound system that comes with the new IMAX technology. But what was most impressive was the sight of Tom Cruise actually climbing the world's tallest building in a clip from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. On the Lockheed Martin Theater's 75-foot wide screen, you could see the terrifying heights from Dubai's Burj Khalifa, and you could see the terrifying crazy of a box office star up close and gigantic.\n\nThis weekend only, the theater is bringing back Star Wars: The Force Awakens in IMAX 3D to show off the new system. While I would love to tell you that Last Year at Marienbad or Jacques Tati's Playtime will be converted to this format, I can't. But if you want to see the next generation in motion picture technology and revisit one of last year's best movies, head for the Mall.", "Author: European Commission.\n\nThe following press release was issued by the European Commission on February 26, 2016 3:45 pm.\n\nThe Commission has concerns that the proposed transaction may result in less innovation and higher prices in the satellite and launch service markets.\n\nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"A competitive space industry has a crucial role in strengthening the EU's industrial base and boosting our global competitiveness.The Commission therefore needs to make sure that all players in the space industry continue to have strong incentives to innovate\".\n\nArianespace is the global leader for launches of commercial satellites to geostationary transfer orbits. Its main competitors are the US-based companies ILS and SpaceX. In addition, Arianespace has a de facto monopoly in the European markets for institutional launches. For its services, Arianespace uses launchers produced by three different companies, including the Ariane launcher manufactured by ASL.\n\nASL is a 50/50 joint venture controlled by Airbus and Safran. Airbus is also one of the leading satellite manufacturers worldwide. Both Airbus and ASL are manufacturers of payload adapters and dispensers, which are components sourced and used by launch service providers.\n\nThe Commission's concerns\n\nThe Commission has concerns that the transaction might lead the merged entity to:\n\ndiscriminate against satellite manufacturers competing with Airbus on price or other terms regarding their access to Arianespace's launch services (slot allocation, access to technical information on launcher developments). This would reduce the incentives of Airbus' rivals to invest and innovate in satellite manufacturing. Moreover, aligning the incentives of Airbus, ASL and Arianespace might also lead to critical information about satellites or launch service competitors being shared between Arianespace and Airbus. give priority to launch services connected to Ariane launchers since ASL produces this launcher. This would be to the detriment of the competing launcher Vega, which is manufactured by ELV and currently can only be commercialised by Arianespace. procure payload adapters and dispensers exclusively from Airbus and ASL, regardless of the price and quality offered by competitors. This would be detrimental to these competitors.\n\nOverall, the Commission is at this stage concerned that the transaction might lead to higher prices, less customer choice and a reduction in research and development efforts in the satellite, launcher and launcher equipment and launch services markets.\n\nThe Commission will now investigate the transaction in-depth in order to determine whether its competition concerns are confirmed.\n\nThe transaction was notified to the Commission on 8 January 2016. The Commission now has 90 working days, until 12 July 2016, to take a decision. The opening of an in-depth investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation.\n\nCompanies and products\n\nArianespace is a French company offering satellite launch services to private and institutional satellite operators. Arianespace is entrusted by the European Space Agency (ESA) with the commercial exploitation of the two ESA-funded launchers: Ariane, which is developed and manufactured by ASL, and Vega, which is developed and manufactured by ELV, a joint venture between Avio and the Italian Space Agency. In addition, Arianespace also offers the possibility to launch with the Soyuz launcher, which is developed and manufactured by TsSKB of Russia.\n\nASL, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, manufactures the Ariane launcher.\n\nAirbus is a Dutch-based company active in aeronautics, space and defence. Within its Defence and Space division, Airbus is active in: (i) satellites; (i) sub-systems for launchers, namely adapters and dispensers for European launchers; and (iii) satellite operations for telecommunication and Earth observation satellites.\n\nSafran is a French company active in aerospace propulsion, aircraft equipment and defence and security.\n\nMerger control rules and procedures\n\nThe Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involvingcompanies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.\n\nThe vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).\n\nThere are currently three other on-going phase II merger investigations:\n\nMore information is available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number M.7724.\n\nCopyright European Commission.", "Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) has suffered a fresh problem during testing of new aircraft engines for the Airbus A320neo, but flight trials of the latest version of Europe's best-selling airliner are continuing, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe problem occurred when an oil pump failed after an engine had been deliberately shut down in flight and left to turn with the natural airflow, a process known as \"windmilling\" which is designed to ensure an aircraft can fly on only one engine.\n\n\"We found a bearing had seized within the main oil pump.

Historically, I've worked on some quite significant transformations with public companies. I was CEO of Thomas Cook and Premier Farnell and I have lived and worked around Asia.\n\nI came to IBM to help with the transformation; the intensity of the change. The businesses that I run are those that are either new - IoT is a brand new creation born out of analytics - or existing. The $3 billion investment that the board committed in March [is testament to the focus]. I will help look at how we build out that business to be a global leader of this movement of IoT.\n\nEducation is another area. Similarly, my role here is to really decide how we play in education in all its forms. There are four markets: K-12, higher education, informal learning and then corporate learning.\n\nThen there's commerce, which is a business I took over five or six weeks ago.\n\nThe only common theme is myself in the sense of leading them! They're all part of IBM's strategic initiatives and they're all determined for significant growth.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges you've faced since joining IBM?\n\nI've been at IBM 128 days, but I'm not counting! I've been really surprised.... I really hoped for the intensity of change, which is normally what I do for a living. And I absolutely found it in terms of people in the organisation knowing their part in this significant transformation.\n\nIt's been really, really exciting to be deluged. And I use that word quite deliberately. I've been completely consumed by clients who are interested in IoT. Some 82 per cent of all enterprises globally believe that IoT is either strategically or transformationally affecting their business. How can companies use this mass of dark, unstructured data?\n\nIBM has this total area of differentiation. When I was an IBM client, I always loved it that there was something IBM had no-one else has. That is Watson. The Watson capability allows us not only to analyse and process this data but to come up with reasoning, interventions and thoughts to help us make great decisions. And we're able to apply that [in a number of customer scenarios] whether it's Airbus, Siemens, Vodafone etc. There's no shortage of interest from customers around 'what do we do with this data?' and 'how can you help us?'\n\nGreen Horizons [and IBM initiative, see video below) are taking data around the mass of pollutants and working with the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) in China to really understand from the data - social media all of the different languages that come from the Watson APIs - satellites, the government, weather stations, myriad of inputs from populous at large - where precisely these pollutants are coming from. So that they can be dramatically reduced - there has been a 20 per cent reduction in pollutants in Beijing since we started this work.\n\nEverything at its core is now a computer - whether it's a contact lens, a hospital bed. Everything can be sensorised, it's what you do with the mass of data... 92 per cent of which currently is loss within seconds of being produced. In the Green Horizons case, most of the sensors were already in place. We did enhance some of them but it was more about the reasoning, the processing.\n\nWatson can create patterns in the data that we cannot easily or as quickly see.\n\nIn a way, the cognitive era that has Watson at its core allows us to help clients make much better decisions or come up with new products for their clients.\n\nIt's not just about enterprise. The digitisation of the physical world is about IT coming out from the back office to the front office. Often the people I'm meeting and talking with are heads of sales, CEOs, not just CTOs, which is a good job as I'm not a technologist.\n\nThere seems to have been a shift, particularly in cloud, in who is making the technology buying decisions. Will more vendors have to follow suit and ensure they recruit people who speak both the language of business as well as the language of technology?\n\nTotally. It's humanising IoT. Buildings, tyres etc are actually talking to one another. It's the humanising effect of this fourth wave of the web, which is the digitisation of the physical world.\n\nIt's how you use this data and decision making to create new products for clients. Instead of saying this is the technology we have to sell, I'm spending a lot of my time asking clients what data they have and what problems are they trying to solve.\n\nWe launched our super centre in Germany - our global HQ for IoT - in December last year. Airbus came to talk about their cognitive cockpit and how there are 300 million parts inside of every engine. By working with us on IoT, they've been able to create new services and capabilities they can sell to other airlines.\n\nThere are all these big numbers about what the IoT will add to the economy and I'm always suspicious about these mega numbers that consultants come up with. The one that does seem to be verified though ($11 trillion of value by 2025) is probably undercalled as how can you put a price on learning and decision-making?\n\nWhen you look at the new products, new capabilities, the new services, the new things that are connected and talking to one another that gives opportunity.\n\nWe are bringing in more business people or people who know verticals really well. Into Watson Health we brought Deborah DeSouza who ran Phillip's health business, we bought the Weather company, which gives us a platform that is access 26 billion times a day. Bringing in people who really understand these elements is really powerful.\n\nThe IoT is probably the first of the waves since the guys at CERN created the web that really is humanising things. And you can see why. Let's take two things the human race hates: They hate to go into hospital when they're sick and they hate when they're old to have to go into a home or not live with their family.\n\nImagine an environment, which is not so far away, where with current camera capabilities, wearables you can monitor everyone to say \"Duncan is fine today\" or \"Maggie and Harriet were being far too active and should rest up. \" Whatever you get as the readout... it's humanising the digitisation physical world.", "The Leviathan II whale-watching ship capsized last October, killing six. For the first time, the survivors and rescuers recount how the tragedy unfolded.\n\nChristian Barchfeld was tumbling around and around -- as though in a washing machine -- inside the lower deck of the Leviathan II. Seconds earlier, the 20-m whale-watch cruiser had suddenly capsized in the North Pacific, off Tofino, B.C. \"There was no cry, no warning -- nothing,\" says the 51-year-old dental technician from Burgwedel, north of Hanover, Germany. The waves had come charging over the stern and tossed the 33-tonne boat like a plastic toy.\n\nThe roll complete, the quiet, stoic German stood. He was in water to his chest. It was ice cold. All around him it was dark. Through the portholes he could see only water -- dark, murky, endless. That's when it dawned on him: He was standing on the ceiling of the vessel's lower deck. The roof was now the floor. Barchfeld was trapped inside a sinking ship, kept alive, for the moment, by an air pocket. This is how I'm going to die, he thought. Breathe, he told himself. Don't panic.\n\nThe fog lifted early on the morning of Oct. 25. By noon, the skies were high and cloudless. The temperatures were on their way to an unseasonably high 15 degrees.\n\nThe Canadian government maintains a data buoy at La Perouse Bank, 34 km off Ucluelet. It's one of six surrounding Vancouver Island that relay oceanographic information back to shore on an hourly basis. By afternoon, it was recording a water temperature of 14\u00b0 C, \"mild\" for the Pacific Northwest, says University of Victoria oceanographer Richard Dewey. The wind was blowing at 5.8 knots, with waves hitting 1.7 m, not unusual for late fall.\n\nStarting in October, a vast, persistent low-pressure system known as the Aleutian Low builds in the Gulf of Alaska, Dewey explains. Beyond the quaint, cedar cottages and salt-stained docks of Tofino, it lashes the coast with cyclonic winds and high waves.\n\nThe unpredictable weather, combined with the North Pacific's craggy shores, have created a dangerous patch of sea known by generations of mariners as the Graveyard of the Pacific. It stretches roughly from the northern tip of Vancouver Island to Tillamook Bay, on the Oregon coast. It's claimed more than 240 ships since 1803, giving it more wrecks per kilometre than anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe waters still claim several lives each year. In mid-September, the Caledonian, a commercial fishing boat capsized off Estevan Point, near Tofino. Three crew drowned, bringing the number of fishing deaths in B.C. last year to six, making 2015 the deadliest year for B.C. fishers in a decade.\n\nBefore the Leviathan II left the Tofino Harbour that day, two young deckhands were readying the 24 passengers for the 1:30 p.m. sailing, a two- to three-hour trip. The journey began with a safety briefing, not unlike the kind given before a flight.\n\nThe first leg was unremarkable. But 50 minutes in, Barchfeld felt sea conditions were beginning to change, as the vessel moved toward the open ocean, away from the protected bays and inlets near Tofino. He was seated directly behind skipper Wayne Dolby, an 18-year veteran of tour boats, and though he was getting nervous, he could clearly see Dolby remained perfectly calm. Looking out to sea, Barchfeld could see higher waves, and descended to the ship's lowest level.\n\nBarchfeld's younger brother, Dirk, 48, who works in Hanover's justice department, started to follow him, but stopped on the middle deck. He leaned against a railing and gazed out to sea. \"I tried to dampen my anxiety and enjoy the adventure.\" Soon, the sea lions at Plover Rocks came into view, and his fear vanished. \"They were adorable, jumping in the air, putting on a little show for us,\" says Elisa Kasha, a Calgary health care worker.\n\nDirk (left) and Christian Barchfeld had taken the trip after the collapse of Dirk's marriage; at first, neither knew the other had survived (Photograph by Michael Danner/Getty Images)\n\nA million tourists a year come to Tofino, a town of 1,200, to surf, storm watch and hike. Over the past two decades, the rain-soaked paradise at the western edge of Vancouver Island has also established itself as a global whale-watch capital.\n\nClayoquot Sound is rich with the plankton, molluscs and krill that draw herring, salmon and whales that in turn lure tourists. Starting in late February, migrating grey whales bigger than Greyhound buses cross Tofino's front porch on their journey north to Alaska from their winter breeding grounds in Baja, Calif. Humpbacks are also a common sight. And by summer, transient killer whales come hunting for salmon.\n\nJamie Bray, a former commercial fisher raised in Vancouver, was the first to realize that tourists would be willing to spend big to watch it all unfold. In 1982, he launched Jamie's Whale Watching Station with a refurbished ex-troller. He announced the venture with six felt-pen posters stapled to telephone poles across Tofino. Anyone wanting to see whales should line up at the pier the following morning at 10, the posters announced. Six turned up. These days, Jamie's, still the town's biggest whale tour operator, will carry an annual 20,000 tourists every year.\n\nBut in Tofino, Bray's reputation is complex. He's conscientious and helped set the industry non-interference policy that protects the whales. He's also a pioneer with a Midas touch. He recently added a hotel, Jamie's Rainforest Inn, and picked up Port Alberni's historic Lady Rose, with plans to convert the decommissioned ship to a restaurant. But nine people have died on his company's boats over the years, including the six who perished on Oct. 25 in the Leviathan II tragedy.\n\nThe accident made news worldwide. There were three crew and 24 passengers aboard, many of them tourists from Europe. Maclean's spoke with more than two dozen people, from survivors, to crew, to rescuers, to family members, in order to reconstruct the desperate struggle for survival that followed the boat's capsize -- and the rescue efforts that ultimately saved 21 lives.\n\nKasha (left) and Dwayne Mazereeuw wanted only to get back to their two children (Photograph by Crystal Schick)\n\nOnly two survivors told Maclean's they saw the wave that caught the Leviathan II. To Kasha's husband, Dwayne Mazereeuw, a Calgary skate park designer, it looked big, but not exceptional. But to deckhand Trinity Jezierski, 21, it looked like a \"giant -- higher than the boat.\"\n\nIf she's right, the Leviathan II may have been claimed by what mariners call a \"rogue\" or \"freak\" wave. \"They are rare, but real,\" says Dewey. \"Their most simple explanation is that they are a superposition of several waves coming from different directions, which sum together to form a much larger wave.\"\n\nWitnesses describe a steep wall of water, often with a hollow trench in front of them. Maritime history is full of battles with such waves. So is Tofino's.\n\nA few years ago, a seven-year-old boy, visiting Tofino from Washington state to celebrate his brother's birthday, went missing. He'd been playing on a concrete pad near the water when his father stepped away for five minutes. A massive search of the surrounding forest and water ensued, but rescuers believe the boy was swept away by a rogue wave. Rogue waves are blamed for the deaths of 20 people along Vancouver Island's West Coast, a rate of one to two per year.\n\nAt Plover Reefs, an outcrop of islets just off Vargas Island, survivors say Dolby steered the vessel along the rocks, turned the ship, then took another pass. This time, waves were hitting the boat from the starboard side, rocking the passengers as they crashed against the hull.\n\nBefore turning and heading for Tofino, survivors tell Maclean's the skipper slowed, perhaps to give them one long, last look at the sea lions. The trip had been a bit of a bust. They'd only seen a couple of grey whales -- no tails, every amateur wildlife photographer's dream shot.\n\nThe Barchfeld brothers estimate Dolby slowed to one-third speed. \"We were kind of sitting there,\" Mazereeuw explains. \"I can't remember if someone said something, or if I just happened to look,\" says Mazereeuw, who saw the approaching wave out of the corner of his eye. \"We're going to get rocked -- I better hang on,\" he thought, grabbing hold of the guard rail. In the next second, a steep wave buried the deck under water. Then all of a sudden, the boat \"started tipping and tipping,\" says Mazereeuw. They keeled dangerously to one side, hanging there for a half-second, as gravity deliberated their case.\n\n\"It wasn't until we were sideways and people were falling over my head into the water that I realized we were in real trouble,\" says Mazereeuw. The next second he was pushed beneath the boat, as it went crashing into the water, completing its roll. Somehow, he maintained his grip on the railing even as he was dragged into the water. \"In all, it took one to two seconds,\" says Mazereeuw. \"It was that quick.\" One moment, the boat was upright, the next, it was down, flooding and sinking.\n\nSea lions at Plover Rock put on a show for the passengers of Leviathan II (Photograph by Adam Chilton)\n\nIn total, 27 people were aboard. The Barchfelds had taken the trip after the collapse of Dirk's marriage. The hockey-mad brothers, perhaps the game's biggest fans in a country that much prefers soccer, took a road trip from Alberta to B.C., catching four NHL games. Mazereeuw and Kasha were taking their first weekend getaway since the birth of their two children, Tysen, 3, and Ella, 18 months.\n\nThe Thomas family -- Julie, 49, her husband David, 50, a Microsoft vice-president, and their youngest son, Stephen, 18, who had Down syndrome -- had left Swindon in southwest England in pursuit of Stephen and David's shared passion for photography. A year earlier, Stephen had won an award for a photo he took of Banff's Moraine Lake. Both he and his dad maintained websites showcasing their art. David noted how \"incredibly grateful\" he was to his \"very supportive\" family who \"put up with all the frequent stops to 'just take a quick picture (or 10!).' \"\n\nNigel Hooker, 63, an engineer and manager with Airbus Defence and Space in Portsmouth, England, and his daughter, Aimee, a police officer, were meeting another daughter, Danielle, 28, a Sydney-based graphics designer, and her boyfriend Rav Pillay, 27, an electrician. Jack Slater, a Toronto entrepreneur and former engineer with the British Navy, was celebrating his birthday with his wife, Marjorie; he'd just turned 76.\n\nAll her life, Katie Taylor, 29, a supervisor at the Whistler Day Spa at the Pan Pacific Hotel had wanted to see whales; she'd taken the trip to Vancouver Island on her own. All were now in the water. The Coast Guard had no idea they were in danger. The crew could do little to help. Their fate was in their own hands.\n\nBeing thrown into cold water this way can trigger a fatal series of physiological reactions, says the University of Manitoba cold water expert Gordon Giesbrecht. First, the shock of the cold will cause a person to gasp automatically. Even the strongest can be killed in seconds this way, if their head happens to be beneath water when they inhale.\n\nHyperventilation is also common. Like the gasp reaction, it's naturally occurring. If not controlled, the panic can be fatal by causing a person to grow faint, says Giesbrecht. A third response is cardiac related. The cold forces the heart to work harder to pump blood throughout the body. At least one victim died from heart failure.\n\nJamie Bray (front right) owned Leviathan II (Chad Hipolito/CP)\n\nIn the days after the accident, Jamie Bray and other operators tried to defend the practice of not requiring passengers to wear lifejackets by explaining they make escape harder in an enclosed boat. That's nonsense, says Giesbrecht. He's conducted a study where people wearing flotation coats are plunged into water: \"The assumption is this will hinder their ability to escape the sinking car.\" It \"really doesn't.\"\n\nMost people who die in cold water don't die from hypothermia, he adds. They drown because cold incapacitation sets in, muscles and nerve endings stop working and they gradually become unable to keep their heads above water. \"That's why a lifejacket is so important. They will be kept alive long after a person becomes incapacitated by cold.\"\n\nPillay was reportedly unconscious by the time he plunged into the water. Survivors tried to keep his head above water but they lost their grip, and he disappeared.\n\nPeople thrust suddenly into extraordinary situations like this report experiencing them in strange and distorted ways. \"Where are the cameras?\" Christian Barchfeld wondered, momentarily dazed. He thought he'd been transported to a movie set.\n\nHis brother Dirk was underwater for 10 seconds before he managed to fight his way to the surface, kicking with all his might. When he burst through, gasping for air, shocked from the sudden cold, the first thing he saw was the hull of the Leviathan II, facing skyward, bright red, like a open wound. Just 10 m from him he could see, and hear, the engine's whirring propellers. He thought immediately of the Titanic, and how passengers had been sucked into the props, and swam as quickly as he could from the heaving boat.\n\nMazereeuw had the opposite reaction: He's a weak swimmer. During his scuba certification he barely made it through the 10-minute swim test. \"I've got 10 minutes of treading,\" he thought to himself: \"I better find something to hold onto.\" He started climbing onto the boat's hull when he heard someone yell: \"Get off the boat!\" Mazereeuw eventually complied. But it was an agonizing decision. He wasn't sure he'd make it.\n\nJezierski, the young deckhand, was trapped in the wheelhouse after the boat capsized. She'd been thrown around the small cabin as the boat flipped. She remembers thinking: \" 'All right, you're going to hit your head, and it's going to be done; it's going to be over.' I was just waiting for impact. I didn't even get to react.\"\n\nBut then she felt a pressure on her chest. \"I figured I must be under the boat. I couldn't see. I started to swim -- I swam down. I knew there was something on top of me.\" She surfaced, disoriented, gasping for air beside the boat. Around her, she heard the sea lions barking and howling, waves crashing, passengers yelling. \"With all the adrenalin running through my body\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009my training kicked in.\"\n\nControl your breathing, she thought. Is anything -- shoes, a sweater -- weighing me down? Then she swam for the first person she saw. Soon after, she says, she spotted a life raft in its canister. She and Dolby, the skipper, deployed the raft.\n\nDirk Barchfeld by then had managed to calm himself by following the example of Jack Slater's wife, Marjorie. She was the first person he'd seen on the water: \"She was floating flat on her back, trying to make herself very calm. She wasn't frantically paddling around -- she wasn't crying.\" Don't panic, he thought to himself. Act like her. He saw an orange plastic life ring in the water near him, and thrust it over his shoulders.\n\nAt that moment, he happened to float past Mazereeuw. \"Can I grab on?\" he asked. Kasha, who'd been calling for Mazereeuw, soon joined them.\n\n\"I knew we were in trouble,\" says Mazereeuw. \"People could have hit their heads on the way in, the boat could have hit people as it capsized. But it was a huge relief -- to know we were both okay and together, at least.\" All around them people were screaming, crying, panicking. Slowly, their group grew to eight: Two middle-aged Texans (a brother and sister), two women from Vancouver Island, Marjorie Slater, Mazereeuw, Kasha and Dirk Barchfeld. Each held onto the small ring with a single hand while treading water. One of the Island women, a strong swimmer, would briefly rest on the ring, then swim out, to increase its buoyancy (she chose not to speak with Maclean's).\n\nShe was the group's informal leader and kept them going, periodically shouting words of encouragement: \"We are going to make it! Don't give up! Stay together!\" Some in the group were in bad shape: One was bleeding from a head wound. At least three were in severe shock and were not speaking. And they were deeply concerned for Marjorie Slater. She was 79, and quickly fading.\n\nThe water was very rough. \"We were taking on water, swallowing water,\" says Mazereeuw. That's when a body, floating face down, clearly dead, was carried into the group by a wave. It was less than a metre from them. \"That's where it really hit,\" he says. \"There's people that aren't making it.\"\n\n\"We're in big trouble,\" Kasha thought.\n\n\"Was that my brother?\" Dirk Barchfeld wondered. He couldn't tell. How many were already dead? Were they all going to die out here?\n\nPhotos taken by Ken Brown of some survivors he and his crew brought aboard his boat, the Kingfisher\n\nHis brother Christian was alive, but in serious danger, trapped in the boat's lower deck with a pregnant woman, and a second woman with a broken leg. They'd been tossed around the cabin as the boat flipped, and suddenly found themselves neck-deep in water.\n\nThe women panicked when they came to a stop, Barchfeld recalls, screaming \"louder and louder.\" Willing himself to stay calm, Barchfeld began searching for the stairway he'd walked down just minutes earlier. He dived again and again into the one- to two-metre water, searching with his hands, hoping to feel the stairwell. It was dark in the hull, though some light was creeping through the murky water. Then Barchfeld's heart sank: he realized the exit had been completely blocked by debris when the boat flipped.\n\nNext, Barchfeld began trying to kick out a window, first using his feet, then his shoulders. \"But it was not possible: The window is so thick.\" Somehow, he remained focused and clear-headed, telling himself over and over again not to panic. He kept diving, again and again, trying desperately to find something -- a hammer, a piece of broken furniture -- that might be used to break through the window.\n\nHe turned to break the news to the two women: they were crying and praying and holding each other tightly, arms wrapped around the other's shoulders in a hug.\n\n\"There is no exit,\" Barchfeld said simply. \"There is no way out. We are completely blocked in.\" They would surely go down with the ship, he thought.\n\nBy then the group of eight had drifted to the ocean side of the rocks and were being thrashed about in the swirling wash, trying to stay above the surface in two-metre waves. With every wave, they got a mouthful of diesel and salt water. All they could do was call out to each other: \"Watch out! Another wave!\" In the distance, less than 100 m from them, they could see the life raft drifting away.\n\n\"We tried to get everyone to swim toward it, kicking together, as a team. And it seemed like we were gaining on it. Then a huge set of waves came crashing over,\" says Mazereeuw. \"Because there were so many on the life ring we were like an anchor. We were being pulled under.\" After all that, they'd been pushed back further than when they started. \"We were beyond swimming or letting go of that ring.\"\n\nOn their own, the more experienced swimmers should have been able to make the 100-m crossing to the life raft. But it was far from clear that all would make it. They chose to stick together, a decision experts say might have saved lives. Expending energy causes heat loss, and humans lose heat 25 to 30 times faster when they're in water than on land.\n\nMazereeuw and Kasha could only think of their two babies, how they hadn't yet prepared a will. What will happen to them if we don't make it back, Mazereeuw kept wondering.\n\nAt that point, Marjorie Slater started going downhill. \"I'm going to die,\" she kept saying, speaking aloud to no one in particular the words they'd all been silently thinking: \"I can't do this anymore.\" Some in the group tried lifting her onto Dirk's shoulder, to prop her head on the life ring, out of the water. They'd floated into a kelp bed, and the slimy seaweed, thick as an arm, would wrap around them, pulling them below water.\n\nKasha's thoughts kept returning to Ella: \"She has curly, fine, baby hair at the back of her head. You know how baby hair smells so sweet? I kept thinking of her curly, blond hair. I would touch her face and run my fingers through it, and smell it.\"\n\nSome had lost feeling in their feet, their arms. They were struggling against exhaustion to keep their faces out of the water. Hypothermia was beginning to set in, Mazereeuw says. He was close to losing consciousness. A second body drifted over and was bobbing in the waves alongside them.\n\nNo one had spoken a word for a long time -- they were beyond talking. \"It was so quiet. It was eerie,\" says Kasha. Some had gone blue or grey or purple from cold, their faces smeared with black diesel, like war paint. The unspoken: No one is coming.\n\n\"I was so tired,\" says Kasha. \"I started to think about just letting go. I wasn't feeling panicked, or nervous. We couldn't see anybody. We had been out there for so long. It was just really quiet. There was nobody\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It's time,\" she thought.\n\nThen the boat, which had been lying parallel to the water, started to shift, and sink, stern first, its bow rising above the water line. Water poured in. This is it, thought Christian Barchfeld.\n\nHis thoughts turned to his family, to his teenaged son, whose roller hockey team he helps manage, to his wife, Edda, who survived a bout with cancer, but whose legs had been amputated from the knee down. He and Dirk were scouting potential locations he might bring Edda. But what he remembers most clearly is how \"completely alone\" he felt in that moment, what he thought was his last on Earth. Remarkably, the will to live remained alight. On an intellectual level, Barchfeld knew it was hopeless, but he kept diving, kept searching for a way out.\n\nThirty minutes had passed. And then, a stroke of luck. As the boat shifted, he saw a bit of light in the bow: Part of the door, which had been impossible to open due to water pressure, was now above the waterline, and he was able to kick it open. The women followed immediately behind him. Earlier, he'd found a life ring, which he'd given them. They grabbed hold of it and pushed away from the boat. That was the last Barchfeld saw of them. (Both survived, though none of the survivors know what happened to the pregnant woman, or her name. The woman with the broken leg declined comment for this story.)\n\nBarchfeld was in deep trouble. The effort to free them had drained him of every last ounce of energy. He was exhausted. If he let go of the boat he would surely drown in the rough seas. He could barely stand. What can I do? he thought. \"I had nothing -- nothing -- left in me.\" Really, there was only one option. He wrapped his arms around a steel bar and clung to the boat with every ounce of energy he had left, the waves tossing him up and down, drilling the steel into his arms, his shoulders, his face. The vessel was equipped with 30 m of rope, which had come loose and had taken on a life of its own, writhing and slithering around the dark water like a sea snake, coiling around and around Barchfeld's ankles, anchoring him to the boat. Even if he needed to abandon ship, he no longer could.\n\n\"I'm going down,\" he thought. He started to think about what it would feel like to drown: Would it be painful? Would it be quick?\n\nIt was at that moment, out of the corner of his eye, that Barchfeld saw a flare arcing overhead. Jezierski and fellow deckhand Etienne Herold spotted a flare floating in the water; together, with Herold holding onto Jezierski's ankles, they stretched out from the raft to grab it and immediately deployed it. Until then, they had done what they could to help rescue other passengers and keep everyone on the raft \"warm and calm, and reassure them there were other boats in the area,\" says Jezierski. \"I knew someone was going to come. I never thought: 'No one is going to come.' \"\n\nThe flicker of hope the flare alighted in Christian Barchfeld powered him through the 30 minutes it took rescuers to arrive onsite. \"Hang on,\" he kept telling himself. It was enough -- barely.\n\nHe remembers being pulled into the boat. Seconds later, he lost consciousness. He was out for 35 minutes. He came to as he was being stretchered into an ambulance at the Tofino Harbour, his mind jolted to reality by the screaming sirens, the flashing lights.\n\nSince returning to his tidy, attic apartment in Burgwedel, Barchfeld has continued to marvel at the tenacity of the human mind, that refused to capitulate, to release him to the ocean. Ken Brown was fishing for halibut with his partner, Clarence Smith, that afternoon. They were doing a \"surplus\" fish off Schott Island, to stock the freezers of elders in Ahousaht, an isolated Nuu-chah-nulth community off the coast of Tofino, Brown had never fished the site before. They'd laid lines on two sides of the island, then went beachcombing. Normally they'd wait three to four hours before checking their gear. But on that day, they headed in an hour early.\n\nBrown can't say why exactly, nor why they chose to haul in the shorter line first, nor why they chose to fish off Schott, nor why they even went out that Sunday at all. But he's a spiritual man. He believes a higher power placed them there, facing the vessel's stern, looking up, at the precise moment a bright red flare arced across the blue sky. Had they gone to haul in the long line first, or waited it out, they never would have seen it, says Smith: \"Everybody could've been gone, I would say.\"\n\nSmith was raised at Nuchatlaht, and was on fishing boats before he could walk, but was sent to residential school in Tofino, where the Tin Wis Hotel now stands. That's where he met his wife, Doreen Smith, from Ahousaht. She was the only good thing to come of that dark, ugly chapter. When he turned 16, Smith walked out the school and onto a fishing boat. It became more than a way of life: It is also a salve, \"good medicine,\" to help heal the scars. He and Brown are on the water nine, 10 hours a day, year-round. They've learned to read the water, where it runs faster, deeper, warmer. \"It's our way of life,\" says Smith. \"It's what we love to do. It's where we love to be.\"\n\nAfter seeing the flare that day, they ripped in the line as quickly as they could and headed out. It was slow going, they couldn't run at full throttle: \"The tide was running and the sea was up,\" says Smith. \"The groundswell was hitting the boat pretty hard,\" says Brown. The closer they got to the accident site, the rougher the water got: \"The current was ripping and we were getting slapped around pretty good.\"\n\nThe rescuers from Ahousaht just happened to be in the right spot at the right time to see the flare (Photograph by Jimmy Jeong)\n\nThe first person they reached was Christian Barchfeld, who was still clinging to the hull. He was \"lifeless, but breathing,\" says Smith. \"He wouldn't move. He wouldn't say anything. He wouldn't try to help us. He wouldn't have made it much longer in the state he was in.\" Brown could see a bright green line wrapped around his ankle. He cut through it in three places to free him after hauling him in. \"I wrapped my driest shirt right around his head and ears, then we wrapped another sweater around his chest and arms,\" says Brown. \"You're gonna be okay,\" he kept telling him. \"You're safe now.\"\n\nWhen they got to the life raft it was being pushed toward the reef: \"If we didn't catch them within a matter of seconds they were gonna get thrown right up on the rocks,\" says Brown. They towed the raft 15 m from the wash then transferred everyone aboard the Kingfisher. The G.I. Charles, a water taxi piloted by Francis Campbell, 43, and his wife, Michelle Campbell, 47, was next on scene. They'd been headed for Tofino with two hikers when Michelle heard Brown's frantic call.\n\nWhen they tried to lift Marjorie Slater she \"slipped right out of my hand, she was so oily and slippery,\" says Francis. When they got her aboard, he gently placed her on the floor and covered her with his jacket. He worried they would lose her on the ride in. He counted down the minutes to Tofino as they rode in, calling to her. Michelle hauled the others in: eight in all. One man was diabetic. He couldn't feel his hands so Michelle dug into his pocket for a candy and placed it in his mouth.\n\n\"The two hikers gave us everything they had,\" all of it expensive, technical hiking apparel and sleeping bags, says Kasha. One survivor was so concerned by her appearance -- she was deathly white from cold -- he peeled back his rainsuit and held her against his warm skin the entire, 30-minute ride to Tofino. Kasha has little memory of it. Mazereeuw, meanwhile, had blacked out by then.\n\nWater taxi driver Francis Campbell was second on the scene (Photograph by Jimmy Jeong)\n\nThe White Star, piloted by Peter Frank Jr., 33, was next on scene. They transferred nine passengers from Smith's overloaded boat. Frank Jr. was terrified: \"It was real ugly out there. There was a big groundswell. The rollers were something else -- coming right up over the boat. I'm half the size of [the Leviathan II] and that boat went down in the weather I'm in.\"\n\nIt was dead quiet when they got going. When they hit a wave he heard the passengers scream. The waves were roaring up and spilling into his bow. Frank Jr. realized they were terrified. He stood: \"I'm Peter Frank Jr.,\" he said. \"This is Peter Frank Sr.'s boat. This is the White Star. This boat's been through some big seas. I can tell you right now, this boat's proven. And you guys are okay now. Everything's going to be all right. We're going to get you to harbour, safe.\"\n\n\"I understood they had been through a whole lot that day. All I could think was: I've gotta let them know they're okay,\" he recalls, tears streaming down his face at the memory. Months later, he's still devastated.\n\nSome of the passengers aboard the White Star were quietly crying. Some were staring straight ahead, in shock. Some threw up, perhaps from the release of adrenalin. One young woman was shaking so violently that Frank Jr. peeled off his jacket and wrapped her in it. \"Thank you,\" she kept saying. \"Thank you for coming for us.\"\n\nWhen they got to Tofino, they saw firefighters, desperate for a miracle, performing CPR on cold, lifeless bodies. It was useless. Some had to be physically pulled off by their superiors, as hope slowly surrendered on the docks. \"I broke a lot of ribs,\" was all one firefighter would say.\n\n\"I wasn't aware that people didn't make it -- until I saw three bodies covered in sheets,\" says Brown. \"That shook me to my core. They belonged to somebody. Each of them had families: Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren they're not going to make it home to see. I cried when I got home.\"\n\nThe dead were: Nigel Hooker, 63, Jack Slater, 76, Katie Taylor, 29, David Thomas, 50, and his son, Stephen, who was just weeks from turning 19. One month later, the body of Rav Pillay, who was listed as missing, and presumed drowned, was found on the beach of Vargas Island. \"I'm not a hero,\" Brown says, something all the rescuers from Ahousaht repeatedly assert. \"I won't ever accept that: I don't agree to it, I don't embrace it. People needed help, and I was there.\"\n\n\"That's the Ahousaht way,\" they will tell you, with a shrug.\n\nGinette Emburey (right) and her partner, Corey Windover, treated the 'walking wounded' at his home (Photograph by Adam Chilton)\n\nWith the freak storms and hardy lifestyles, tragedy on Vancouver Island is not uncommon. With police and Coast Guard spread thin, citizens are often forced to fend for themselves, relying on a volunteer fire corps, paramedic crew and search and rescue team when disaster strikes. \"It's people's way of getting out and serving the community,\" says paramedic Corey Windover. \"Nobody's out looking for accolades.\"\n\nIt wasn't just paramedics. The rescue operation was an all-volunteer squad: The only people paid to assist were the hospital and Coast Guard staff.\n\nWord of the capsizing ricocheted around Tofino. Nine off-duty paramedics and a firefighting team of equal size responded.\n\nThey were met on the dock by Sara McArthur, Jamie's safety and operations manager. Earlier that evening, she'd received a call that the office was unable to reach the Leviathan II by radio when expected. \"While I was on the phone I heard it come over the Coast Guard channel -- the Leviathan II had capsized. I dropped everything, and raced to the dock to see how I could be of any help.\" It was an emotional scene, she says. \"At that point we were trying to figure out how many were accounted for and who may still need rescuing.\"\n\nUnit chief Bill Craven was the acting incident commander at the docks, organizing ambulances, stretchers, blankets, flannels and warming pads. He assigned a fire captain to act as scribe. He asked every person coming off a boat three questions: \"What is your name? Who are you missing? Can you name anyone else on the boat?\"\n\nWhen doctors sent word not to flood the hospital, Windover jumped in: \"My house is just off the docks, halfway up the hill to hospital.\" The \"critical\" and \"more than critical\" went to hospital. The so-called \"walking wounded\" were initially treated at Windover's house before being sent to hospital when a bed opened up.\n\n\"It's like a business,\" says Craven, a retired banker: \"You have to divide out who needs the most attention the quickest.\"\n\nBill Craven (left) organized the scene at the docks and Tim Oh worked at the hospital (Photograph by Adam Chilton)\n\nCathy George, who owns Tofino's Himwitsa Gallery, rushed to the Co-Op to buy food to bring to the hospital (the Co-Op refused to let her pay). Charles and Kari-Anne McDiarmid, owners of the Wickaninnish Inn delivered blankets and slippers to Windover's. Ralph Tieleman, a local stock broker, brought pizzas and lent out his cellphone so survivors could call home.\n\nWindover and his partner, Ginette Emburey, ushered the hypothermic into warm showers, washing and drying their clothes, feeding them tea and cookies. \"That's when a second wave came over us,\" says Dirk Barchfeld: \"A wave of help.\"\n\nUp the road, at the hospital, the vibe was \"controlled chaos,\" say paramedic Tim Oh. In all, 18 people were treated for hypothermia in the hospital. Three were transported to area hospitals for further treatment. Oh can't shake the image of survivors who learned their family members had not made it: \"It's hard not to go to them, to comfort them.\"\n\nBut there were also beautiful moments, like when Windover brought Dirk Barchfeld into the hospital room where his brother was being cared for: Neither was aware the other had survived. \"An ocean of anxiety fell off me,\" Dirk Barchfeld recalls. \"It was the most freeing feeling.\"\n\nChristian was so bruised -- black and blue all over his arms and legs -- from trying to punch his way out of the boat, doctors initially refused to release him, wanting to keep him overnight for observation. They relented, to allow him to retrieve his heart medication in neighbouring Ucluelet.\n\nThe brothers now refer to Oct. 25 as their \"new birthday.\" The two are polar opposites: Dirk is as gregarious and outgoing as Christian is shy and reserved. They loved each other deeply, but weren't particularly close before the tragedy, Dirk Barchfeld explained after dinner at a Burgwedel restaurant. The accident has bonded them in a way they never knew was possible.\n\nKasha also feels forever changed. She feels the \"Grim Reaper\" is \"two steps behind them.\" Like the Barchfelds, she feels tremendous guilt for having survived: \"I want to look at it like we have this second chance, but everything about that feels so wrong,\" she says, in her northeast Calgary home. She thinks of those who lost their lives \"every day.\" Was it quick? Did they have someone with them at the end?\n\n\"There won't be a day I don't think about it,\" McArthur says. \"Every day, all day. As long we're living and working in this community.\"\n\nTo try to move forward, many families are looking for ways to repay their rescuers. Mazereeuw's company, New Line Skateparks, is donating time and resources to build a skate park for Ahousaht youth. (He and Kasha are also donating money to help fund the project.) The Barchfeld brothers, who have formed a tight bond with rescuers Brown and Smith, have sent gifts, as have members of the Slater family. Jack's niece, Tracy Binks, is raising funds for a literacy program at Tla-o-qui-aht through her Salford tea group. Every family is desperate to visit B.C., to thank the men and women of Ahousaht, Tofino, Tla-o-qui-aht.\n\nAt this point what went wrong is still not known. The complete Transportation Safety Board (TSB) accident report is not expected for months. An error by the skipper has not been ruled out. But nor is anyone suggesting it at this point. Could a rogue wave be blamed? Or an unstable load? Questions were raised about stability issues after the TSB reported that most passengers were on the top deck, on one side.\n\nAhousaht fisher and taxi boat operator Richard Little, who has spent 54 of his 59 years on the ocean, observed unusually rough seas and strange wave patterns that day, a day after hurricane Patricia, the strongest hurricane on record, spun off the coast of Mexico in the eastern Pacific, reaching speeds of 346 km/h (185 knots). Little believes the tail end of the hurricane's path was impacting the Pacific all the way to B.C.\n\nBoats sit idle at Jamie's Whale Watching Station in Tofino (Kevin Light/Reuters)\n\nWhether any of this translates to legal responsibility may now be a matter for civilian courts to decide. Several survivors, including some not named in the story, are contemplating suits. They'll wait, they say, to see what the TSB finds.\n\nWhat is clear is the immense hole left in the lives of multiple families.\n\nFor Jack Slater's daughters, there is a kind of double tragedy: Their father had left for Canada in 1972 after a bitter divorce when his three daughters were all under 10. Their mother moved frequently, and their dad disappeared from their lives.\n\nFor years, they'd believed he was dead, as their mom told them. It was only after a cousin contacted them on Facebook a few years ago that they learned the truth. For decades, Michele Slater Brown had been living just 90 minutes from her father, in Milton, Ont. He'd been looking for her and her sisters for years.\n\nShe burst into tears when she first saw him: \"The connection was immediate.\" He apologized. \"But it wasn't his fault. It was nobody's fault. I wasn't angry, at all.\" She just ached for everything she missed, for all she'd lost in the years between.\n\n\"I always missed him,\" she says. \"I always thought of him.\"\n\nOn a frigid December day, Jack's daughters, Michele Brown, 52, Karen Clarke, 51, and Janine Lowe, 47, buried their dad in the Agecroft Cemetery in Salford, a gritty borough of Manchester, in northwest England; he is buried beside his parents, Jack and Nora and a tiny Canadian flag. The older he got, the more he missed England, he used to say.\n\n\"What's always in my heart and my mind,\" says Jack's sister, Pat, speaking to Maclean's from a nearby pub, where the family gathered to remember Jack, \"is they've lost him twice.\"\n\n\"We had so little time,\" says Brown. She was just staring to to know the man she'd always yearned to see.", "Nigel Farage's claim that three major companies that operate in the United Kingdom do not care if Britain leaves the EU appears to have been contradicted - by the bosses of the three companies.\n\nSpeaking to Nicky Campbell on Radio 5 on Tuesday, Farage said: \"They (big businesses) say they support the EU. But from Nissan, to Toyota to Airbus, they all say the same thing: if Britain did leave the EU, that would make no difference to their business and their investments in this country.\"\n\nHowever this week, the CEOs Nissan, to Toyota to Airbus all said they were not keen on Brexit.\n\nNissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn, said on Tuesday:\n\n\"Our preference as a business is, of course, that the UK stays within Europe - it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs. For us, a position of stability is more positive than a collection of unknowns.\n\nPresident and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe, Johan van Zyl, also said on Tuesday:\n\n\"We are concerned that leaving would create additional business challenges. As a result we believe continued British membership of the EU is best for our operations and their long-term competitiveness.\"\n\nAnd on Wednesday Airbus Chief Executive, Tom Enders said:\n\n\"If Britain leaves, I cannot imagine that this would have positive consequences for our competitiveness in Britain.\n\n\"Wings are only going to be continued to be made here if we maintain our global competitiveness.The EU genuinely helps us to be globally competitive.\"\n\nFarage was speaking the BBC after bosses from 36 FTSE 100 companies signed a letter, published in The Times, arguing exit from the EU would deter investment in the UK.\n\nThe Ukip leader said he expected support for Brexit would come from \"smaller companies\" that had EU regulations \"dumped on their heads\" from Brussels.\n\nOn Friday, David Cameron was dealt a fresh blow as a former Tory leader said the EU renegotiation has \"met with failure\" and called for a vote to cut ties with Brussels.\n\nMichael Howard, once a political mentor to the prime minister, says he believes Britain should vote to leave to \"shake Europe's leaders out of their complacency\" - potentially leading to an alternative deal which could be put to a second referendum", "When the Government Accountability Office (GAO) last week rejected the appeal from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) related to the awarding of an $80 billion contract to Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) for the new Long Range Strike Bomber, the two companies said they planned to consider their options. That didn't take long.\n\nReuters on Thursday cited a source who said that Boeing officials have told the U.S. Air Force that the company will take no further legal action to challenge the award to Northrop.\n\nBoeing already has taken some action though. On Wednesday the company named Leanne Caret as the chief executive officer of its defense and space division, effective March 1. Current division CEO Chris Chadwick took over just two years ago when Dennis Muilenburg, now CEO of the company, was moved to the chief operating officer position under former CEO Jim McNerney.\n\nChadwick, 55, is retiring after 34 years at Boeing.\n\nLosing an $80 billion contract can be a career-limiting issue. Caret, who is 49, has spent 28 years at Boeing and is currently heading the defense division's global services and support group. Caret has also served as the chief financial officer of the defense division and as vice-president and general manager of the helicopter business.\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nCEOs Who Have to Go in 2016\n\nThere can't be much question that the change at the top of Boeing's defense and space division stems from the loss of the bomber contract. Boeing won the new tanker contract after a decade-long struggle with Airbus, and the new bomber was the last of the massive new Air Force contracts for the next few years, at least. Boeing has had to write-off $1.3 billion on that tanker over the past two years, which probably didn't improve Chadwick's standing, nor did declining revenues.\n\nBoeing has teamed up with Saab in a bid for a new training jet for the Air Force, but that contract is unlikely to be anywhere near the same size. Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) entered the field for the new training jet last week with partner Alenia Aermacchi.

(NYSE: LLL), and Lockheed and partner Korean Aerospace.\n\nThe Air Force is expected to publish a request for proposals later this year and award a contract in 2017 with an initial operational capability deadline of 2024. The contract is expected to require about 350 of the new trainers to replace the existing T-38 fleet.\n\nBy Paul Ausick", "London City Airport's sale to a Canadian-led group of investors at a steep premium received a cool reception from both its biggest user and the top U.K. airline, which said they won't accept the higher fees that might be imposed to justify the price.\n\nWillie Walsh, chief executive officer of British Airways owner IAG SA, said Friday that a deal reckoned to be valued at 2 billion pounds (US$2.8 billion) could wipe out already-thin margins.\n\n\"We're not going to be in a position where a new owner can just jack up prices and we'll continue to do what we've done historically,\" Walsh said. \"If they do increase charges we will carry out our strategy and reduce capacity. If the routes to London City are not profitable, then we won't go there.\"\n\nWhile London City has increased its passenger tally by 50 per cent in five years and is the closest terminal to the U.K. capital's financial center, it's a fraction the size of Britain's leading hubs, faces opposition from leading politicians and is limited in its growth prospects by a runway that can't take full-size jets.\n\nAccording to people with knowledge of the matter, the winning bid, from Alberta Investment Management Corp., Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and OMERS, is about 44 times London City's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 45.8 million pounds in 2014, the latest year with available data. No price was given when the deal was announced Friday.\n\nTop Dollar\n\nThe average multiple for airport deals in 2014 was 17, including debt, according to aviation consults ICFI. Investment funds are increasingly willing to pay top dollar for assets offering stable long-term returns after years of low interest rates.\n\nThe CityFlyer arm of IAG's British Airways unit would most likely shift services to London Stansted, Walsh said. BA said this month that the unit would start flights from the airport 30 miles north of London -- which has direct rail services to the banking district -- in order to better utilize London City-based Embraer SA planes unable to operate during a weekend flight ban there.\n\nCityJet Ltd., the airport's biggest carrier, share's IAG's doubts about the deal, according to owner Intro Aviation, where CEO Peter Oncken said it had provoked \"some concern.\" Intro bought CityJet in 2014 after Air France had struggled for 18 months to sell the unprofitable business, and said in October it would bring in 15 Russian Superjet 100s to refresh the fleet.\n\nRunway Limit\n\n\"I don't think refinancing the purchase price with higher fees would work,\" Oncken said in an interview. \"London has six airports, and passengers would think twice about how to get from A to B if one got more expensive. The owners know this and we expect them to come forward to tell the airport users how they plan to proceed.\"\n\nWhile London City, six miles from the main financial district and half that distance from the new banking hub of Canary Wharf, is a favorite with passengers partly because of the modest size of its terminal, which means they can get from the curb to the plane more rapidly than at bigger bases, the ease of travel is partly a reflection of operational limitations.\n\nBecause City was built on a quayside on the banks of the Thames its runway is so short at 1.2 kilometers that only regional aircraft can operate with a full fuel load, limiting each flight's passenger total and range. BA operates the Airbus Group SE A318 fitted with 32 lie-flat business seats there, though must refuel in Ireland in order to complete the trip to New York.\n\nPolitical Dimension\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson wants to limit operations at City and even close the airport on the grounds that its inappropriate for terminals to be located in urban centers because of the associated noise and air pollution.\n\nJohnson, one of Britain's leading politicians and seen as a possible future prime minister, last year vetoed a 250 million- pound plan to add aircraft stands, an arrivals terminal and taxiway to help City make an already-authorized jump to 6.5 million passengers a year by 2023, compared with 4.32 million in 2015. An appeal is scheduled to be held shortly.\n\nLondon Heathrow, the capital's biggest hub and the busiest in Europe, attracted 75 million travelers last year -- or 17 times as many.\n\nThe airport's sale is expected to close on March 10, according to a statement from 75 per cent owner Global Infrastructure Partners. The Canadian-led group, which also includes Kuwait Investment Authority, had vied with China's HNA Group and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. to acquire the facility.\n\nOpened in 1987, City was sold to Irish businessman Dermot Desmond for 23.5 million pounds in 1995 before being acquired by GIP American International Group Inc. in 2006. Reports at the time said the companies paid 750 million pounds, though terms weren't disclosed. Two years later, AIG sold its stake to GIP and Highstar Capital, which will also dispose of its 25 per cent holding.\n\nBloomberg.com", "* Announces capital increase plan for a minimum of 50.0 million euros ($55.0 million) (issue premium included)\n\n* Is for further industrial and clinical development to seek CE mark approval\n\n* A pool of strategic investors will fully subscribe the 50.0 million euro equity financing\n\n* Reserved capital increase may be potentially supplemented by a private placement among qualified investors of a size yet to be determined\n\n* Airbus is taking 22.0 pct; Cornovum (Bpifrance & french state) is taking 34.0 pct\n\nFurther company coverage: ($1 = 0.9088 euros) (Gdynia Newsroom)", "Thomson ReutersA flight test engineer holds an Airbus Group flag after the first flight of the Airbus A320neo in Colomiers near Toulouse\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Airbus Group\n\nEurope's largest aerospace group said operating earnings before one-off items, a measure of underlying performance, rose 2 percent to 4.132 billion euros ($4.55 billion) as revenue gained 6 percent to 64.450 billion.\n\nAnalysts were on average predicting full-year core operating income of 4.114 billion euros on revenue of 64.736 billion, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nAirbus said it would produce seven A330 aircraft a month from 2017.

The airline currently has 73 A380s in its fleet and has 67 more on order.\n\nBOOKMARK: Find the latest aviation news directly via the Today in the Sky homepage\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nEmirates will fly A380 to D.C. after United drops Dubai route\n\n\"It's a huge important part of what we are,\" Rob Gurney, Emirates' Senior Vice President - North America, says in an interview with Today in the sky. \"It's our flagship product.\"\n\n\"Bringing it to D.C. is an important step, adding another point on our global network that's served by the A380 aircraft,\" Gurney says. \"It's also very important for us here in the U.S. market.\"\n\nEmirates other U.S. destinations that currently have either full-year or seasonal service on A380 aircraft are New York JFK, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas/Fort Worth. Emirates also flies the A380 to Houston Bush Intercontinental, though the carrier's schedules show a switch to 777 service for flights after June.\n\nGurney declined to specifically say whether Emirates might boost its A380 presence in the United States, saying only that \"we're constantly looking at those opportunities.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Gurney noted the number of A380s still scheduled to be delivered to Emirates, suggesting some of those newly delivered planes could end up flying on North American routes.\n\n\"We're just over halfway through that delivery program,\" Gurney says about the carrier's existing order for A380s. \"There's more aircraft to come. I'm sure we'll see some of this aircraft being flown into the U.S.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIs Emirates targeting U.S. airlines with new Jennifer Aniston ad?\n\nEmirates A380 is perhaps best known for its swanky first-class cabin, where the luxurious lie-flat seats also come with access to an in-flight shower. Emirates has recently launched a publicity campaign for its high-end seats, including ads with actress Jennifer Aniston that are now airing in select U.S. markets.\n\n\"The A380 is a great product,\" Gurney says. \"It is a customer magnet. People are attracted to that product.\"\n\nBut tickets for the cabin don't come cheap. Fares for a May round-trip between Washington and Dubai started at a cool $23,549 according to a Feb. 24 search of Emirates' website. Fares in Emirates first-class cabin were a bit cheaper for the airline's flights between New York JFK and Milan, starting at $7,281 for the same dates.\n\nWhether you've got the cash or not, you can check out Emirates' first-class cabin - as well as its business- and coach-class cabins - in the above photo gallery that we put together from our Feb. 23 tour of the jet. Or check out the gallery below from when Emirates showed off its A380 last year during a similar show-and-tell in Orlando.

Boeing's order flow dropped to 768 jets last year from 1,432 in 2014. Last month, Muilenburg warned that plane deliveries and revenue would fall slightly this year, the first annual declines since 2010.\n\nAt an investor conference this month, he blamed the dip largely on a switchover to a new version of Boeing's 737 jetliner, predicting deliveries will pick up again in 2017 and rise to more than 900 per year by 2021 from 740 to 745 this year. Overall demand remains strong, he said, noting air traffic continues to grow despite slowdowns in emerging economies. \"If you look at both commercial and the defense markets broadly, aerospace is growing,\" he said.\n\nStill, Boeing shares have dropped 20 percent this year, extending a yearlong decline, as investors mull uncertainties facing the new CEO. Headline issues include profit margins on the innovative 787 Dreamliner and a defense business that hasn't won a big Pentagon contract in a while. (Muilenburg named a new defense chief on Feb. 24.)\n\nBut attention is shifting to the single-aisle jet market, where archrival Airbus is mounting a serious challenge to Boeing's workhorse 737. The European manufacturer has captured a majority of sales since launching the A320neo in 2010.\n\nMuilenburg told analysts the contest has been 50-50 since Chicago-based Boeing started selling an upgraded 737 MAX, which is scheduled to go into production this year. Airbus, however, upped the ante with the A321neo, a new single-aisle jet that's turning heads among airlines.\n\nTHREE OPTIONS\n\nThe new CEO must choose the right strategy to defend this critical franchise. The 737 accounts for three-quarters of Boeing's order backlog and generates healthy profit margins. \"That's the biggest long-term decision they face,\" says analyst Chris Higgins at Morningstar, calling the 737 \"incredibly important. It's the main profit driver of the company.\"\n\nMuilenburg can stick with the current 737 MAX, update it again or design a new plane for the upper end of the single-aisle market.\n\nHe told analysts, \"we think that the market today is served by our current product line,\" but said Boeing would evaluate potential demand for a new or modified plane and probably make a decision in the next year to year and a half.\n\nStanding pat is the least expensive option but risks long-term market share losses if Airbus' new plane continues to gain ground with airlines. Another 737 upgrade might keep pace with Airbus at less cost than a new plane but may not offer enough improvement to dominate the market.\n\nA completely new design could vault Boeing past Airbus in a lucrative market segment, as the 787 has done. Yet a new plane would cost billions of dollars at a time when Wall Street wants Boeing to focus on cash flows and share buybacks. Before stepping down as CEO, McNerney promised no more \"moon shots\" were in Boeing's immediate future.", "Last week, Air Canada announced plans to buy up to 75 of Bombardier's new C-Series jets worth $3.8 billion.\n\nAn air of inevitability surrounds the billion-dollar bailout Bombardier is seeking from Ottawa. The financial markets anticipate a yes, most political observers say it is a foregone conclusion, bureaucrats hint a deal is in the works and several cabinet ministers have sent positive signals.\n\nThe Liberals want to get the optics right: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau must appear to demand tough concessions from the Montreal aerospace manufacturer to fend off demands from other hard-hit industries. But he is expected to ante up soon.\n\nThat is the way things have gone in Ottawa for the past 50 years, as my colleague Thomas Walkom pointed out in an informative primer in the Sunday Star. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says Ottawa must invest in Bombardier. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard calls it a \"no-brainer.\"\n\nThe only vocal objectors are the premiers of Saskatchewan and Alberta who are angling for equal support for the oilpatch and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation which considers corporate welfare a waste of money.\n\nWhat is missing from this regional/ideological tug-of-war is a rational cost-benefit analysis.\n\nBefore the Liberal government gives a dollar to Bombardier, it needs to have affirmative answers to these six questions:\n\n1.) Does a $1-billion corporate subsidy meet the litmus tests set by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, this week, in his fiscal update? \"We need to make smart, necessary investments that will stimulate growth, support our middle class and care for the most vulnerable members of our society.\"\n\n2.) Is shoring up Bombardier a higher priority than delivering the unfunded promises in the Liberal platform? These include upgrading the infrastructure of Canadian cities; investing in green technology; building affordable housing; reversing the \"chronic underfunding\" of First Nations education; holding a national inquiry on missing and murdered aboriginal women; implementing the 94 recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; adding $3 billion to home care; boosting the pensions of 1 million low-income seniors; improving compensation for veterans and restoring funding to search-and-rescue teams.\n\n3.) Does Bombardier actually need federal money? Last October it got a US$1 billion ($1.38 billion Canadian) rescue package from the Quebec government. Last week Air Canada announced plans to buy up to 75 of the company's new C-Series jets worth $3.8 billion. The Liberals could require the contractor of Canada's new fighter jets to have them built, or partly built at Bombardier's facilities. No doubt an extra $1 billion from federal coffers would strengthen the company's competitive position. But that could be said of any corporation.\n\n4.) Is Bombardier committed to creating -- or even preserving -- jobs? The evidence suggests otherwise. Last week it laid off 7,000 employees, 2,830 of them in Canada. \"I feel good about our ability to turn Bombardier around given these actions,\" CEO Alain Bellmare said. Last spring it cut 1,700 workers in Downsview and Montreal.\n\n5.) Can Ottawa afford to subsidize Bombardier? The projected federal deficit is already 84 per cent higher than the Liberals anticipated. The government can't count on economic growth or rising oil prices to bring in a gush of revenue. It doesn't intend to cut public services or raise income taxes (except for those earning more than $200,000). By the time the prime minister and his colleagues factor in their election promises, they could be looking at a shortfall of $25 billion to $30 billion.\n\n6.) Is Bombardier a smart risk? Six years ago, its executives gambled they could expand the company from a manufacturer of business aircraft (Learjet) and short-haul regional turboprops into a big-league player competing with Boeing and Airbus. They staked the company's future on a new generation of transcontinental \"whisper jets.\" But Bombardier was unable to deliver C-Series jets on time or within budget. The launch is now two years behind schedule. Until Air Canada stepped forward last week it had gone without an order for 17 months. It still hasn't reached its target of 300 firm orders by the time the jets start commercial flights.\n\nIt is unlikely any of these questions will be asked, let alone answered. They're certainly not part of the current debate. Quebec wants the same treatment Ontario got in 2009 when Stephen Harper bailed out Chrysler and General Motors. The West wants the same treatment Quebec gets. Business analysts argue that all industrialized countries subsidize their aerospace sectors. Political commentators point out Trudeau has 40 MPs from Quebec.\n\nThat is the way it has always gone -- and will go until the nation elects a government with the backbone to say no.\n\nCarol Goar's column appears Monday, Wednesday and Friday.", "Leasing firm Avation (LON:AVAP) now has a fleet of 35 owned aircraft, it said, as it delivered a new Airbus A321-200 to holiday giant Thomas Cook.\n\nAvation chairman Jeff Chatfield said: \"Avation is pleased to deliver this new Airbus A321 to Thomas Cook Airlines Limited on a 12 year lease.\n\n\"This brings Avation's current fleet of owned aircraft to 35.

Photo: Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg News By Robert Wall Robert Wall The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyRobert Wall @R_Wall robert.wall@wsj.com Updated Feb. 26, 2016 6:16 a.m. ET\n\nLONDON -- British Airways ICAGY -4.02 % parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA reported a 77% rise in full-year profit and should see further gains in 2016 on a sharp drop in fuel costs and improved operational performance.\n\nThe company's closely watched operating profit, excluding last year's acquisition of Aer Lingus, was \u20ac2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) compared with guidance of \u20ac2.25 billion to \u20ac2.3 billion, the London-based airline said. Operating profit should top \u20ac3 billion this year for the first time.\n\nNet profit was \u20ac1.54 billion while sales advanced 13% to \u20ac22.9 billion, though they fell on a constant currency basis. Sales in the fourth quarter were dented around \u20ac45 million by the terror attacks in Paris in November.\n\nNevertheless, shares in IAG slumped 4.8% on Friday after rising 5.28% the day prior in anticipation of higher profit. RBC Capial analyst Damian Brewer said IAG's shares would likely see a sustainable benefit from its improving financial performance in the second half of the year.\n\nAll IAG units delivered stronger results before exceptional items. British Airways was the biggest profit contributor for the group with a \u00a31.38 billion ($1.93 billion) operating profit. Iberia's operating profit before exceptional items surged almost 400% to \u20ac247 million, with Vueling contributing \u20ac160 million in operating profit. Aer Lingus had a full-year operating profit of \u20ac124 million, of which \u20ac35 million is included in IAG results.\n\nChief executive Willie Walsh has said IAG would focus on cutting costs this year as it seeks to further boost returns. He reinforced that message Friday warning the airline would be ready to cut flights at the London City airport near the British capital's financial sector if new owners raise costs.\n\nGlobal Infrastructure Partners on Friday said a consortium including the Alberta Investment Management Corp. and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board had won the bidding for the airport.\n\nChief financial officer Enrique Dupuy said \"there is more to do\" on cutting costs at each of IAG's airlines. The group is changing its approach to maintaining planes and managing information technology to lower costs across IAG, he said, including by renegotiating contracts.\n\nThe initiatives are starting to raise union concerns over job losses. The British GMB union on Feb. 29 plans to protest outside British Airways's headquarters over IT job cuts.\n\nIAG also is targeting lower aircraft fleet costs. Talks are progressing particularly well on adding leased Boeing Co. BA 1.15 % 777-300ER long-range jets, he said, with negotiations advancing, albeit at a slower pace, on adding rented Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbos. Mr. Walsh has previously signaled renting the planes would be cheaper than buying new ones.\n\nMr. Walsh, who wouldn't say when the planes may arrive, said capacity plans this year were unchanged. IAG capacity should expand around 5.3% this year on a pro-forma basis.\n\nThe partnership with Qatar Airways also is providing further opportunities to lower costs, Mr. Walsh said, as well as boost sales. Qatar Airways is IAG's largest shareholder.\n\n\"We've got an excellent relationship with Qatar,\" Mr. Walsh said, with more opportunities for joint procurement identified already for this year and next. A joint-venture agreement, which would allow the two partners to closely coordinate fares and schedules, isn't currently on the agenda, though Mr. Walsh wouldn't rule it out.\n\nThe rapid network expansion at Doha-based Qatar Airways also provides opportunities for more code-sharing, the IAG CEO said.\n\nLower fuel costs are still likely to be the biggest driver of higher profit this year.\n\nFuel is among the airline industry's biggest cost, so the plunge in oil costs since mid-2014 has driven the industry to deliver record profits.\n\nIAG's fuel bill should be around \u20ac1.2 billion lower in 2016 than last year. It should drive operating profit, which rose \u20ac945 million last year, up a similar amount in 2016, the airline said.\n\nUnlike other carriers, Mr. Walsh said IAG wouldn't weigh in on the political debate unfolding in the U.K. over exiting the European Union. Britain will hold a referendum on staying in the EU on June 23. European discount carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY -0.47 % PLC this week began lobbying for Britain to remain in the bloc.\n\nMr. Walsh said an exit would spur uncertainty, but not have a material impact on the company.\n\nIAG this year will also see changes among top management, with Alex Cruz, chief executive of Vueling, taking over British Airways where Keith Williams is retiring. The head of IAG's cargo operations is becoming the chief financial officer at BA.\n\nMr. Walsh also said that Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto would become chairman and CEO of Spanish budget unit Vueling, replacing Alex Cruz, who the company last year said would take over as chief of British Airways. Mr. S\u00e1nchez-Prieto is currently Iberia's chief financial officer.\n\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi says the Russian plane that crashed in Sinai in late October was downed by terrorists seeking to harm Egypt's tourism industry and ties with Moscow.\n\n\"Has terrorism ended?

Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport is being attributed to the the downturn in the oil sector.\n\nJ.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport saw a six per cent decline in passengers numbers in 2015 from the previous year. The drop is being attributed to Canadian North ceasing its charter service to Sydney in April, as the downturn in the oil sector continues.\n\nA total of 187,288 commercial and charter passengers travelled through the Sydney airport in 2015, representing a six per cent decline from the previous year. It's the first time in four years that the airport has had a decrease in traffic.\n\n\"The decrease in passengers was attributed to the loss of Canadian North flights,\" airport CEO Helen MacInnis said in an email response to questions.\n\nWith layoffs in Alberta's oilsands resulting in fewer Cape Bretoners travelling West to work, Canadian North terminated its charter service to Sydney completely in April. The result was a loss of nine flights per week at the Sydney airport.\n\n\"This happened early in the year so the decline in passenger traffic for 2015 was not unexpected but it was disappointing,\" said MacInnis.\n\nDespite the decline in passenger numbers, MacInnis noted there were a number of positive developments at the airport in 2015, including the start of daily year-round service between Sydney and Halifax by WestJet Encore, adding to WestJet's seasonal, daily direct service between Sydney and Toronto in the summer.\n\nThis winter, Air Canada increased its capacity by 50 per cent by providing service with a larger 75-seat aircraft on the Sydney-to-Toronto route, in addition to the five flights per day it offers between Sydney and Halifax. And this spring and summer, Air Canada Rouge will operate the 136-seat Airbus 319 on the Sydney-to-Toronto route and Air Jazz will offer five flights per day between Sydney and Halifax with the 50-seat Dash 8 300s.\n\nMacInnis said the results of the airport's annual passenger survey in 2015 were overwhelmingly positive, with 96 per cent of travellers expressing overall satisfaction with the Sydney airport.\n\n\"We were very pleased with the passenger survey results,\" she said. \"Our focus at the airport has been on improving the passenger experience, which includes maintaining and upgrading facilities as well as going the extra mile to provide excellent customer service.\"\n\nAnd with the present value of the Canadian dollar, MacInnis noted they're hoping they will welcome even more travellers to the region in 2016.\n\nThe 187,288 passengers who travelled through the Sydney airport in 2015 was about 12,000 fewer than in 2014 when 199,655 passengers were served by the airport.

The Tiger's specs are comparable to the US Apache AH-64, but lighter, quieter, and with a longer range. The helicopter is also equipped with Hellfire missiles, 70-millimeter Hydra rockets, and 30-millimeter cannon shells, as well as Stinger missiles, providing it with anti-aircraft capacity.\n\nAllies in the so-called \"war on terror,\" including Germany, France, and Spain, successfully deployed variants of the Tiger to combat zones in Afghanistan, but Australia faced challenges with the helicopter that could not be overcome.\n\nThe Australian Tiger has consistent software malfunctions that technicians have struggled with for years.

A higher proportion of leisure travellers driven by the expansion of its leisure airline subsidiary rouge, increased stage length and lower fuel surcharges helped drive Air Canada's 2015 passenger unit revenue down 4.4% as yields fell 4.6%.\n\nAir Canada cited some pricing pressure in Western Canada, particularly in the province of Alberta in 4Q2015, that is continuing into 1Q2016. WestJet, which is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, is forecasting a unit revenue decline of 7% to 8% in 1Q2016, driven mostly from weakness in Western Canada. Calgary is WestJet's largest base for the week of 22-Feb-2016 to 28-Feb-2016, based on seat deployment.\n\nSee related report: WestJet pushes ahead with its widebody evolution as its stock valuation has fallen by half\n\nAir Canada maintains that it is immunised against the weakness faced by WestJet, stressing that two thirds of its CAD13.9 billion (USD9 billion) in passenger revenue recorded for 2015 was driven by its international markets. The airline stated that it had moved capacity out of Alberta in 2015, but explained that it was not piling on the capacity pulled from the region into other markets to depress margins on those routes.\n\nCompany CEO, Calin Rovinescu, highlighted numerous international markets introduced by Air Canada in 2015, including Vancouver-Osaka, Montreal-Venice, Toronto-Amsterdam, Montreal-Mexico City, and Toronto to Delhi and Dubai. At present, (22-Feb-2016 to 28-Feb-2016), 74% of Air Canada's ASM are deployed onto international routes.\n\nAir Canada international vs domestic capacity (% of ASMs): 22-Feb-2016 to 28-Feb-2016\n\nMr Rovincescu declared that Air Canada had executed its international expansion in 2015 profitably.\n\nAlthough Air Canada has decided not to offer annual capacity guidance, the airline has previously stated that 2015's growth of approximately 9.4% could be a benchmark for 2016's expansion.\n\nThe company expects that 90% of its capacity expansion in 2016 will be directed toward international markets. It has announced a raft of new markets operated by rouge in 2016, including seasonal flights from Montreal to Casablanca and Lyon, and from Vancouver to Dublin. New seasonal services from Toronto include Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and London Gatwick.\n\nAir Canada will compete directly with rival WestJet on the Toronto-London Gatwick service, marking the first time the two airlines will compete directly on trans-Atlantic flights. Other long haul routes that Air Canada is introducing in 2016 include Toronto-Seoul and Vancouver-Brisbane.\n\nSee related report: Air Canada's valuation remains lower than its peers as work continues on long haul expansion\n\nDomestically, Air Canada's capacity additions in 2016 will be limited to meet local market growth and feed its international network. The company's executives stated that the rest of domestic Canada was somewhat competitive, but that is not abnormal.\n\nSimilarly to rival WestJet Air Canada is citing the flexibility that it has with its fleet, should conditions in its domestic or international network worsen. By mid-2016 Air Canada will have 23 aircraft in its fleet (widebody and narrowbody) that it will own outright. The company estimates that represents 3% to 5% of capacity that \"we could sit for no cost\", said Air Canada CFO Michael Rousseau.\n\nThe airline also has 18 leases up for renewal in the next year and a half. \"We are in a much better position with 40 of our planes to reduce capacity in the short-term,\" Mr Rousseau concluded.\n\nIn Feb-2016 Air Canada opted to give fellow Canadian company Bombardier a shot in the arm for its troubled CSeries programme by committing to order 45 firm CS300s, with options for 30 additional aircraft. The letter of intent coincided with the government of Quebec dismissing a lawsuit against Air Canada claiming that the airline had violated a regulation that required it to keep heavy maintenance in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. The litigation stemmed from the 2012 closure of Aveos, which performed heavy maintenance for the airline. As part of the settlement, Air Canada agreed to conduct heavy maintenance of the CSeries in Quebec. Prior to the dropping of the litigation, in Oct-2015 Quebec had outlined plans to invest USD1 billion into the CSeries programme.\n\nAlthough it seems as if Air Canada could have been nudged by the Quebec government to place a CSeries order, publicly the airline is declaring that it felt no pressure to purchase the aircraft.\n\nAir Canada's commitment to the CSeries occurred after the release of Bombardier's earnings, in which the conditional order for up to 30 CSeries jets from Porter was omitted. It has never been clear whether Bombardier received nonrefundable deposits due from Porter in Aug-2014. In late 2015 Porter lost a campaign to operate the narrowbody aircraft from the Toronto Island Billy Bishop airport.\n\nSee related report: Porter Airlines' ambitions fade at Billy Bishop. Time is of the essence to deliver a new strategy\n\nPerhaps with the likely discounting it received on the aircraft, Air Canada now has a new perspective on the CSeries. \"Obviously, we had to get the right deal for it to make sense for Air Canada, and we did,\" said Air Canada President, Passenger Airlines, Ben Smith.\n\nMr Rovincescu stated that the first 25 CSeries narrwobodies are replacing Embraer 190s exiting Air Canada's mainline fleet, and the Bombardier jets offer a 10% unit cost reduction over the aircraft they are pegged to replace. The Bombardier narrowbody jets join an order that Air Canada placed for 61 Boeing 737 Max jets in late 2013, in which Boeing agreed to purchase 25 of 40 Embraer 190s in Air Canada's mainline fleet. As of 27-Feb-2016 Air Canada had 31 Embraer 190s in its mainline operating fleet. Boeing Max deliveries start in 2017, followed by the first Cseries deliveries in 2019.\n\nWith deliveries three years away, Air Canada is not offering much insight into how the CSeries will function in its network. Mr Rovinescu stated that the Boeing 737-8/9 Max narrowbodies that the airline has on order perform better at the high end of the narrowbody size range. The -8 can be equipped with 200 seats in a single class configuration, and 162 in a two class layout.\n\nThe -9 features 220 seats in a single class configuration and 180 with two classes. The Max aircraft on order by Air Canada are replacing the Airbus narrowbodies in the company's fleet, which all feature a two class layout. Its 16 A319s feature 120 seats, the 37 A320s are operated with 146 seats, and the company's 15 A321s are configured with 183 seats.\n\nThe 135-seat CSeries is much more compelling at the lower end of the size range, Mr Rovinescu concluded. Air Canada's Embraer 190s are configured with 97 seats, which is 38 fewer than the CSeries. Once the CSeries is introduced, Air Canada's total fleet (including regional operators) will range from 19-seat turboprops to its high density 458-seat 777-ERs.\n\nCiting Canada's size, and how it is positioned in the middle of a mix of traffic flows in the North American market, Mr Smith stated that the Boeing 737 Max, Air Canada's 787s and the CSeries would allow the airline to offer numerous unique city pair combinations.\n\nThe timing of other events surrounding Air Canada's decision to order the CSeries is perhaps curious. But the order does give the manufacturer a key North American customer just as its client Republic Airways Holdings, which has 40 CSeries on order, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late Feb-2016. With orders from Porter and Republic in doubt, Air Canada's pledge to order the CSeries offers the programme some stability. Given the settlement that Air Canada has reached with the government, it has no room to back out of its CSeries deal.\n\nDuring the last year Air Canada has repeatedly had to explain that falling yields and unit revenues are byproducts of its long term strategy, as its stage length has been growing 3% to 4% annually during the last couple of years and its mix of leisure passengers has increased. In late 2015 Air Canada stated that it had been a challenge to communicate the drivers of unit revenue declines to the market place.\n\nDuring 2015 Air Canada's stock price traded far below its North American peers - American, Delta and United. Its stock hit a high of CAD14.50 per share in Jun-2015, but in late Feb-2016 it had fallen to CAD7.24 per share.\n\nThe airline is obviously frustrated with what it considers to be an undervaluation and perhaps short-sightedness by some investors over its long term strategy.\n\nAs a result, Air Canada has decided to forego forward-looking quarterly and annual unit revenue and capacity guidance. \"We believe such information and guidance without the context of full quarterly review of other key financial metrics risks distorting the proper understanding of our progress against our key financial targets and long range plan,\" said Mr Rousseau.\n\nFrom now on, Air Canada will report its progress on achieving an EBITAR margin of 15% to 18% between 2015 and 2018, and an ROIC of 13% to 16% for that time period, and on posting a leverage ratio of 2.2x or less by 2018. In 2015 Air Canada delivered on those targets, posting an EBITAR margin of 18.3% and achieving an ROIC of 18.3%. Its leverage (net debt to EBITAR) for the 12M ending Dec-2015 was 2.5x. \"Frankly, a 15% to 18% EBITAR margin should support a much higher valuation for Air Canada,\" Mr Rousseau concluded.\n\nAir Canada's decision not to offer guidance on some key metrics is interesting in the light of stock valuations of large North American airlines falling below levels that executives of those companies think are appropriate. Mr Rovinescu has drawn a line in the sand with short term investors, stating that his management team is not running the airline for the benefit of that type of investor. He stated that if short term investors are not happy with Air Canada's decision to stop offering certain types of guidance, \"I encourage them to leave\".\n\nAfter stressing to investors to focus on more long term targets during the last couple of years, Air Canada has boldly decided to take steps to steer investors toward what it deems as better points of focus - margins, ROIC and debt reduction.\n\nIt is a message most North America airlines are attempting to communicate to investors as lower fuel prices have created some softness in fares.\n\nIt is too early to determine whether Air Canada will be successful in its efforts to push investors to shift their focus away from yields, unit revenue and capacity, but its decision not to offer guidance for those metrics is the most definitive move yet by an airline to nudge investors to think differently.\n\nWant more analysis like this?

The company hasn't finalized how much it wants to raise and could offer as much as a 30 per cent stake, the regulatory limit for foreign holdings, she said.\n\n\"We plan to make VietJet a global airline,\" Thao said from her Hanoi office. \"We look at Emirates, which came from a country with a small population and has become a global airline. We want to make VietJet the Emirates of Asia.\"\n\nThe Dubai-based carrier is the world's biggest long-haul airline with flights to about 150 destinations, and said last month it plans to add 37 new planes -- worth $14.5 billion U.S. ($19.5 billion Canadian) at list prices.\n\nVietJet, which featured dancing flight attendants clad in bikinis on an inaugural route and bikini models on its airplanes for a desktop calendar, carried 9.3 million passengers in 2015, an increase of 66 per cent from 2014. Revenue soared 205 per cent last year to 10.9 trillion dong ($662 million Canadian) while net income rose to almost 1 trillion dong, according to the company. The airline expects revenue to double this year and passenger capacity to reach 15 million this year.\n\nThe airline is aiming to seek a valuation of at least $1 billion (U.S.) for the initial stock sale, according to two people with knowledge of the plan, who asked not to be named because the information is private. That would make VietJet a more valuable company than Malaysia's AirAsia, PT Garuda Indonesia or Thai Airways International.\n\nVietJet will probably surpass national carrier Vietnam Airlines as the nation's biggest domestic carrier this year, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Vietnam is expected to rank among the world's 10 fastest-growing aviation markets in the next two decades, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\n\"It's an ideal market for low-cost carriers,\" or LCCs, said Brendan Sobie, Singapore-based chief analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. \"This makes VietJet an attractive scenario for investors. They don't have the risks other LCCs have in terms of overcapacity and competition.\"\n\nThe low-cost carrier is seeking to expand in a market that's grown 20 per cent annually in the last three years, according to the airline. VietJet earlier this month signed a $3.04 billion (U.S.) deal to buy Pratt & Whitney engines to outfit 63 Airbus A320neo and A321neo airplanes it contracted last year. The company plans to add a dozen planes annually to its fleet of 42 planes at year-end, Thao said. It wants to have a fleet of 100 by 2020.\n\nIt also plans to expand international routes to cities in South Korea, Malaysia, China and Japan this year, Thao said.\n\nMoving beyond VietJet's core low-cost business to long-range international routes will require a lot of investment in larger aircraft and developing an international brand, Sobie said. \"It's a riskier and harder market to get into.\" In Vietnam, he added, the carrier has \"first-mover advantage.\"\n\nThe IPO is also being planned as Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index slumped 17 per cent this year, reversing a 19 per cent gain in 2015. Vietnam's VN Index, Southeast Asia's best performer last year, has fallen 3.4 per cent since the start of 2016.\n\nStill, the stock sale is being planned as frontier-market equity funds from Sweden to Hong Kong are ready to buy more Vietnamese stocks, attracted by cheap valuations and the fastest economic growth in almost a decade. Coeli Asset Management and Asia Frontier Capital say they plan to add to their equity holdings this year as record-high foreign direct investments and the nation's free-trade agreements help boost economic growth.\n\nVietJet, founded in 2007 by Thao, competes with national carrier Vietnam Airlines, which owns 70 per cent of budget carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd. holding the remaining 30 per cent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co., known as Vasco, which it plans to split off as a commuter service.\n\n\"We are ready to go to the next level,\" said Thao. \"We're ready to take the opportunities that the country's international integration will bring.\"\n\nWith files from John Boudreau and Joyce Koh.", "Bombardier Inc. summoned two Quebec opposition leaders to its Montreal headquarters to help clear up any confusion about its C Series aircraft program, saying the heated debate on its future taking place across Canada is being used by rivals to undermine its sales efforts.\n\nManagement for the plane and train maker invited Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec leader Fran\u00e7ois Legault to its head office last Friday and met with Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau Monday. The two politicians, both former business executives, have been critical of the $1-billion (U.S.) investment deal Quebec signed with Bombardier for its C Series program, arguing taxpayers are being had. The federal government is mulling a request for a similar-sized investment in the company.\n\n\"There has to be a debate\" about public aid for the plane maker, acknowledged John Paul Macdonald, Bombardier's senior vice-president in charge of communications. \"We just think it's important that the people who are involved in these debates have the opportunity to hear directly from us and from [Chief Executive] Alain Bellemare about what the situation is.\"\n\nMr. Macdonald characterized the meetings as part of regular outreach with stakeholders that Bombardier does on important issues. But the fact that the vice president is speaking out personally to media while normally staying behind the scenes suggests the company has become alarmed about what's being said in the wake of the Quebec deal, and an order for up to 75 C Series planes from Air Canada. Bombardier also announced 7,000 layoffs, including 2,400 in Quebec, earlier this month as part of a corporate restructuring effort.\n\n\"The premier is like a little fish facing sharks in the negotiations with Bombardier and Air Canada\" Mr. Legault said in a Feb. 25 statement, adding Quebec has to demand job guarantees as part of its investment and needs to renegotiate the agreement. He said nothing in his meeting with Bombardier's CEO changed his mind on the matter.\n\n\"This deal is not a good one and it won't get better,\" Mr. P\u00e9ladeau said Monday after his own meeting with Mr. Bellemare, adding Quebec should have invested in Bombardier Inc. and not just in the C Series. \"The premier is responsible for this chaos.\"\n\nBombardier says it has no plans to renegotiate the deal with Quebec, which gives the province a 49.5 per cent stake in a new limited partnership holding the assets of the C Series program and warrants for up to 200 million subordinate voting shares at a strike price of $2.21. And it says it will not commit to a guaranteed employment level.\n\nImplementation of the letter of intent with the province and the carving out of the C Series program are progressing well and expected to be completed in the second quarter, according to Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau. The deal is key for the company, representing half of the $2-billion required to bring the C Series program to projected cash-flow break-even in 2020-2021.\n\nBombardier shares rose 4 per cent to $1.10 Monday. They've gained 22 per cent since Bombardier announced the Air Canada order on Feb.17.\n\nMr. Macdonald said the discord taking place in Quebec's legislature, combined with negative commentary about the company in mainstream media, is being used by Bombardier's competitors to try to influence prospective customers about its survival prospects.\n\nTo some extent, that's always been the case. But recent aircraft order wins by both Boeing and Airbus have shown that Bombardier's rivals are being extremely aggressive in their bid to block the 100 to 150-seat C Series from getting a significant toehold with certain airlines.\n\n\"They used every opportunity they can get to inject a tone of instability into our [sales] campaigns,\" Mr. Macdonald said of the competitors. \"That's a fact.\"\n\nDespite increasing pressure from Quebec business leaders and lawmakers in recent weeks, the federal government has given no indication about when it plans to announce a decision on Bombardier.

If the routes to London City are not profitable, then we won't go there.\"\n\nWhile London City has increased its passenger tally by 50% in five years and is the closest terminal to the UK capital's financial center, it's a fraction the size of Britain's leading hubs, faces opposition from leading politicians, and is limited in its growth prospects by a runway that can't take full-size jets.\n\nAccording to people with knowledge of the matter, the winning bid -- from Alberta Investment Management Corp., Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, and OMERS -- is about 44 times London City's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of \u00a345.8 million in 2014, the latest year with available data. No price was given when the deal was announced on Friday.\n\nTOP DOLLAR\n\nThe average multiple for airport deals in 2014 was 17, including debt, according to aviation consults ICFI. Investment funds are increasingly willing to pay top dollar for assets offering stable long-term returns after years of low interest rates.\n\nThe CityFlyer arm of IAG's British Airways unit would most likely shift services to London Stansted, Mr. Walsh said. BA said this month that the unit would start flights from the airport 30 miles north of London -- which has direct rail services to the banking district -- in order to better utilize London City-based Embraer SA planes unable to operate during a weekend flight ban there.\n\nCityJet Ltd., the airport's biggest carrier, share's IAG's doubts about the deal, according to owner Intro Aviation, where Chief Executive Officer Peter Oncken said it had provoked \"some concern.\" Intro bought CityJet in 2014 after Air France had struggled for 18 months to sell the unprofitable business, and said in October it would bring in 15 Russian Superjet 100s to refresh the fleet.\n\nRUNWAY LIMIT\n\n\"I don't think refinancing the purchase price with higher fees would work,\" Mr. Oncken said in an interview. \"London has six airports, and passengers would think twice about how to get from A to B if one got more expensive. The owners know this and we expect them to come forward to tell the airport users how they plan to proceed.\"\n\nWhile London City, six miles from the main financial district and half that distance from the new banking hub of Canary Wharf, is a favorite with passengers partly because of the modest size of its terminal, which means they can get from the curb to the plane more rapidly than at bigger bases, the ease of travel is partly a reflection of operational limitations.\n\nBecause City was built on a quayside on the banks of the Thames, its runway is so short at 1.2 kilometers that only regional aircraft can operate with a full fuel load, limiting each flight's passenger total and range. BA operates the Airbus Group SE A318 fitted with 32 lie-flat business seats there, though must refuel in Ireland in order to complete the trip to New York.\n\nPOLITICAL DIMENSION\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson wants to limit operations at City and even close the airport on the grounds that its inappropriate for terminals to be located in urban centers because of the associated noise and air pollution.\n\nMr. Johnson, one of Britain's leading politicians and seen as a possible future prime minister, last year vetoed a \u00a3250-million plan to add aircraft stands, an arrivals terminal, and a taxiway to help City make an already authorized jump to 6.5 million passengers a year by 2023, compared with 4.32 million in 2015. An appeal is scheduled to be held shortly.\n\nLondon Heathrow, the capital's biggest hub and the busiest in Europe, attracted 75 million travelers last year -- 17 times as many.\n\nThe airport's sale is expected to close on March 10, according to a statement from 75% owner Global Infrastructure Partners. The Canadian-led group, which also includes Kuwait Investment Authority, had vied with China's HNA Group and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. to acquire the facility.\n\nOpened in 1987, City was sold to Irish businessman Dermot Desmond for \u00a323.5 million in 1995 before being acquired by GIP American International Group, Inc. (AIG) in 2006. Reports at the time said the companies paid \u00a3750 million, though terms weren't disclosed.

An institution that stretches across the continent, from Ireland and the UK to Poland and Romania. It invests billions in this continent, and benefits from the euro, free trade, and the free movement of labour. It's hugely respected, and has been around for decades.\n\nI'm thinking not of the European Union, but of Unilever. And there are many others too. Think of Volkswagen or EADS. Would you ever think of breaking Unilever up into the individual countries in which it does business?\n\nWhat strikes me about the Europe debate is how narrow it tends to be, and how negative. But savvy investors and the companies in which they hold shares know that by being part of the EU, we're connected to the rest of this great continent. They know the EU doesn't make Europe more complicated - it actually simplifies it. It links the economies, the currencies and the governments. It also links the companies, the scientists and the stock markets.\n\nWhy on earth would you break those links?\n\nOne argument for leaving Europe is that it's very expensive. We say it costs us around 0.5% of our GDP. I work in research, helping academics bring science funding to my university. Much of our funding actually comes from the EU. If we were to leave the EU, the universities would find that their research funding would fall away dramatically, and many valuable research networks would be broken up. We may pay a lot into Europe, but we get a lot in return.\n\nAnother argument is the euro. And Europe certainly has been struggling in recent years with the crisis in Greece. I still feel Greece would be better off outside the eurozone. But investors buying shares in European companies, firms doing business in the EU, and holidaymakers know how much trouble a single currency saves them. Whether you're a bank, a consumer goods company or a retailer, the euro makes life much easier.\n\nBut the euro-separatists have an ace up their sleeve: what about immigration? Yes, certainly there's a lot of migration into the UK - arguably too much. But I think Britain's job creation machine is actually benefitting because of immigration, and despite the huge influx, the employment rate in this country is the highest since records began.\n\nWe would be plunging into the unknown if we left Europe, and such a move would be incredibly disruptive. Now if things were going badly, disruption might actually be a good thing. But after eight long years, Britain is finally booming again. I baulk at the thought of what might happen to the FTSE 100 and the pound if we left, as do many business leaders. I see no point in disrupting things now.", "Americans might be getting larger, but commercial airline seats aren't.\n\nIn fact, the amount of leg and seat room we have on flights has progressively been cut over the past few decades in order for airlines to cram more seats onto planes.\n\nAnd there's currently no legal barrier to prevent airlines from further shrinking seat width and seat pitch (the amount of space between rows).\n\nEnter US Senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe Democrat from New York told the Associated Press' Michael Balsamo that he will add an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Bill that's currently under review by congress to set a standard for the size of airline seats.\n\n\"One of the most vexing things when you travel on an airplane is there's almost no legroom on your standard flight,\" Schumer told Balsamo.\"There's been constant shrinkage by the airlines.\"\n\n\"We cannot comment on pending legislation,\" an FAA spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe amount of space that airlines have cut has been significant over the years.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the average width of airline seats in 1985 was between 19 to 20 inches.

The two companies had flirted with it for years, even before General Electric Co's failed bid to acquire Honeywell in 2000. But the talks never advanced beyond initial approaches.\n\nThat time was no different. Cote responded negatively, telling Chenevert he believed Honeywell's stock would be worth $100 in a few years. He was proven right.\n\nWhile Honeywell's stock has risen more than 80 percent since then, and is near all-time highs, UTC's stock has risen only by a third, and is down a third from its 2015 peak.\n\nCote, 63, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables by unveiling a $90.7 billion bid this week.\n\nEven after running Honeywell for 14 years, Cote's appetite for the top job is undiminished. He proposed a deal in which Honeywell would be the buyer and lead the merger, with Cote holding both CEO and chairman titles of the combined company.\n\nThis account, based on two sources briefed on the meeting and public filings, shows why Honeywell, which had previously shied away from a deal, was happy to confirm its interest in UTC this week from a position of strength. It also illustrates the challenges UTC now faces in resisting a deal.\n\n\"It is very opportunistic of Dave. I don't blame him, but it's not going to happen,\" Greg Hayes, UTC's CEO since 2014, said on CNBC this week.\n\nUTC argues that a merger with Honeywell would face insurmountable antitrust obstacles and strong customer opposition, citing concerns expressed by Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. Honeywell says antitrust issues are limited and can be addressed through asset sales.\n\nHoneywell has also argued that the combined company, which would have a market capitalization of more than $160 billion, would be able to offer a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers, with the annualized cost synergies reaching $3.5 billion. UTC disputes that figure, and points out that the asset sales required to receive antitrust approval and customer concessions would destroy a lot of value.\n\n\"If Honeywell wants to buy at a full and fair price, then yes, I would want to sell,\" said Daniel O'Keefe, portfolio manager at mutual fund manager Artisan Partners, which owns a $212 million stake in United Technologies.\n\nHoneywell, which has a scheduled investor day on March 2, has no plans to go hostile with its bid, according to the sources. However, UTC's stock has been rising every day since Honeywell's approach was disclosed on Tuesday, and is now up 10 percent since then, as investors bet on a deal happening.\n\nAs a result, UTC will have to present a compelling standalone plan at its annual investor day on March 10 to keep its shareholders on board. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company has already been going out of its way to maintain investor support.\n\nUTC removed Chenevert in late 2014 after he refused to consider a sale of storied helicopter maker Sikorsky, according to the sources. Chenevert, who now works at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nChenevert was succeeded by Hayes, whose first act was to announce a strategic review of all options. He reached out to Honeywell again in April 2015 to explore a merger, but cooled on the idea after he saw the antitrust environment become more stringent and UTC's stock lost value on disappointing earnings.\n\nUTC later sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp for $9 billion and agreed to use the proceeds to fund additional share repurchases.\n\nAt a time when peers such as General Electric Co have been slimming down to focus on core businesses, UTC has retained its diversity. It makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines.\n\nBut UTC's businesses are not all faring equally. Its underperforming Otis elevator division, for example, is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line.\n\nIn light of UTC's latest snub of Honeywell, it will also have to explain why separating its aerospace from its buildings divisions does not make sense. Hayes has no intention of breaking up the company, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Instead, it will focus on initiatives such as its investment in its Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines.\n\n\"In terms of capital allocation and portfolio management, UTC has done a pretty good job of looking after shareholders and its assets. But you could argue that the company could be broken up,\" Artisan Partners' O'Keefe said.\n\nThe fact that UTC and Honeywell have the same top six shareholders - Vanguard Group, BlackRock, MFS Investment, Wellington Management, JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street - means that both companies are largely playing to the same audience.\n\nVanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wellington declined to comment. MFS and State Street did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe advanced notice period to propose board members at UTC's annual meeting expired on Jan. 28, so any activist investor would have to wait a year to submit a slate of board directors. As of Dec. 31, no major activist hedge fund was invested in the company's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The company hasn't finalized how much it wants to raise and could offer as much as a 30 percent stake, the regulatory limit for foreign holdings, she said.\n\n\"We plan to make VietJet a global airline,\" Thao said from her Hanoi office. \"We look at Emirates, which came from a country with a small population and has become a global airline. We want to make VietJet the Emirates of Asia.\"\n\nThe Dubai-based carrier is the world's biggest long-haul airline with flights to about 150 destinations, and said last month it plans to add 37 new planes -- worth $14.5 billion at list prices.\n\nBikini-Clad Attendants\n\nVietJet, which featured dancing flight attendants clad in bikinis on an inaugural route and bikini models on its airplanes for a desktop calendar, carried 9.3 million passengers in 2015, an increase of 66 percent from 2014. Revenue soared 205 percent last year to 10.9 trillion dong ($488 million) while net income rose to almost 1 trillion dong, according to the company. The airline expects revenue to double this year and passenger capacity to reach 15 million this year.\n\nVietJet will probably surpass national carrier Vietnam Airlines as the nation's biggest domestic carrier this year, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. Vietnam is expected to rank among the world's 10 fastest-growing aviation markets in the next two decades, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\n\"It's an ideal market for low-cost carriers,\" or LCCs, said Brendan Sobie, Singapore-based chief analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. \"This makes VietJet an attractive scenario for investors. They don't have the risks other LCCs have in terms of over-capacity and competition.\"\n\nRegional Expansion\n\nThe low-cost carrier is seeking to expand in a market that's grown 20 percent annually in the last three years, according to the airline. VietJet earlier this month signed a $3.04 billion deal to buy Pratt & Whitney engines to outfit 63 Airbus A320neo and A321neo airplanes it contracted last year. The company plans to add a dozen planes annually to its fleet of 42 planes at year-end, Thao said. It wants to have a fleet of 100 by 2020.\n\nIt also plans to expand international routes to cities in South Korea, Malaysia, China and Japan this year, Thao said.\n\nMoving beyond VietJet's core low-cost business to long-range international routes will require a lot of investment in larger aircraft and developing an international brand, Sobie said. \"It's a riskier and harder market to get into.\" In Vietnam, he added, the carrier has \"first-mover advantage.\"\n\nThe IPO is also being planned as Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index slumped 14 percent this year, reversing a 19 percent gain in 2015.

The benchmark gauge fell 0.2 percent as of 10:10 a.m. local time.\n\nStill, the stock sale is being planned as frontier-market equity funds from Sweden to Hong Kong are ready to buy more Vietnamese stocks, attracted by cheap valuations and the fastest economic growth in almost a decade. Coeli Asset Management and Asia Frontier Capital say they plan to add to their equity holdings this year as record-high foreign direct investments and the nation's free-trade agreements help boost economic growth.\n\nVietJet, founded in 2007 by Thao, competes with national carrier Vietnam Airlines, which owns 70 percent of budget carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC , with Qantas Airways Ltd. holding the remaining 30 percent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co., known as Vasco, which it plans to split off as a commuter service.\n\n\"We are ready to go to the next level,\" said Thao. \"We're ready to take the opportunities that the country's international integration will bring.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "NEW DELHI: In a first for India, a serving Union minister will soon be flying for a commercial airline on an honorary basis to keep his pilot licence valid.\n\nUnion minister of state for skill development and parliamentary affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a trained pilot on the Airbus A 320 aircraft has got offers from Air India and IndiGo to fly as an honor ary pilot.

The A-320, which he is trained to fly, is the most commonly-used among Indian carriers. While IndiGo has 101 of them in its fleet, with 430 more on order, the aircraft is the backbone of the Air India (domestic) fleet or that of the erstwhile Indian Airlines. GoAir, Vistara and AirAsia India have only this aircraft in their fleet.\n\nBut with only IndiGo and AI having sizeable operations on this plane (Go has 19, Vistara 9 and AirAsia In dia 6), Rudy's choice is limited to these two airlines.\n\nHe is likely to opt for IndiGo as he has earlier served as an honorary pilot with the budget carrier for two years from 2010.\n\nRudy's aviation background goes beyond his stint as a pilot. He was the aviation minister in former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government for a year from May 2003. His wife Neelam Pratap used to be a senior cabin crew incharge with the erstwhile Indian Airlines. In fact, she was heading the cabin crew of IA subsidiary Alliance Air when Rudy became aviation minister in 2003.\n\nRudy is the only Indian parliamentarian who flies.

Shortly after taking on the role, he promised to stabilise the embattled airline, adding that discussions with Myeni was one of his first orders of business.\n\nAs the finance mininster, Gordhan has the power to appoint and remove board members since executive authority over SAA was transferred to the Treasury in December 2014. These powers are outlined in the SAA Act, Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and Companies Act.\n\nMyeni has extremely close ties with Zuma and many believe he fired Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister over his resistance to a proposed Airbus swap deal.\n\nNow Gordhan is apparently determined to remove Myeni from the airline's board, reported the Sunday Times, adding that he allegedly informed Zuma about his intentions.\n\nAccording to a source, Zuma ignored Gordhan, forcing him to repeat his intentions. \"This time the president simply responded that he had heard him. He never said yes or no, or asked why,\" reported the Sunday newspaper.\n\n'Opportunistic and malicious'\n\nTlali told Fin24 three meetings took place between SAA and Gordhan since he took over as finance minister.\n\n\"Since his reappointment to this portfolio as the minister of finance, SAA's board of directors interacted with Minister Gordhan on at least three occasions and on two occasions through direct meetings.\"\n\nTlali said Myeni was present in two meetings and on one occasion the chairperson was in a telephonic conversation with the minister.\n\nHe said people suggesting there is a rift are \"opportunistic, malicious and simply misleading everybody\" who are concerned about the relations between National Treasury, the minister and SAA.\n\n\"I can indicate to you that there is a meeting that is scheduled to take place soon, but I do not have the date on hand,\" Tlali said.\n\n\"We continue to have a solid and professional relationship based on mutual respect between ourselves and the finance ministry. Suggestions that there are no interaction or the relationship is not healthy are simply misleading\".\n\nGordhan will boot out Myeni\n\nRoodt told Fin24 that although SAA is a politically sensitive issue, he thinks Gordhan will get rid of Myeni.\n\n\"I have a suspicion that Pravin Gordhan is going to force his will through and in the process Dudu Myeni will lose her job, which is a good thing. I think he is going to get what he wants and that is to merge SAA with SA Express.\"\n\nHowever, he said that a merger won't make much of a difference despite the benefits that may come with it.\n\n\"SAA has been a disastrous institution for a very long time and SA Express is a tiny airline, so from a financial point of view it won't make much of a difference, but it is certainly a step in the right direction,\" said Roodt.\n\nHe recommended that the government privatise SAA, but he indicated that Gordhan already alluded in his Budget Speech of bringing in a minority equity partner.\n\n\"I think what they are going to do is see if they can get a minority private sector shareholder and it will make sense if it is an international airline so that they can make use of the opportunity as a springboard to offer services in Africa,\" said Roodt.", "AS365 and EC155 family owners/operators forum scheduled for Wednesday\n\nLouisville, Ky.

I manage a team in my way of thinking that is the best way to do it and I don't change it. It's not an obligation to my word, it's an obligation to think that we are doing it one way in that tournament and it's important to try to finish until the end in the same way.\"\n\nWith City out of the FA Cup and trailing Premier League leaders Leicester City by six points, tomorrow's showpiece against Liverpool is likely to offer a less hazardous route to a trophy than the prospect of seeing off the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich to win the Champions League.\n\nSo the match matters at Wembley, but despite Caballero's performance at Chelsea and similarly erratic performances this season against Tottenham Hotspur and Everton, Pellegrini dismissed suggestions that there is any risk attached to selecting the former Malaga goalkeeper.\n\n\"I answered already your question,\" Pellegrini said. \"I know the mentality of all the players, so it doesn't matter.\n\n\"You think as a manager how best to manage the squad and not just the team. We are going to play in our final and we must be focused on our final.\"\n\nFor Caballero, however, the opportunity to emerge from Hart's shadow to play in a Wembley final is one he insists he is prepared for.\n\n\"It is my desire to play in this final and I am ready,\" Caballero said. \"Do I deserve to play? It could be, but I have been thinking about this game for a long time since we won against Everton in the semi-final. It's not easy to be in my position, but you have to accept it because that's the life of a second keeper. It's hard, but we have to be ready and hopefully I get the opportunity.\n\n\"But Manuel [Pellegrini] has given me the confidence by playing me in this kind of game. That's been really important for me, but for him it's important to win.\n\n\"To be a big team, you need to win trophies, so that's what we need to do now.\"\n\nWith only Kevin De Bruyne ruled out of Pellegrini's first-choice starting team, having injured knee ligaments in the semi-final victory against Everton, the key selection dilemma for the Chilean is likely to centre on whether to select former Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling ahead of Jesus Navas.\n\nSince completing his acrimonious \u00a349m transfer from Anfield last summer, Sterling has struggled for consistency, after some impressive early-season form. But if he picks the England player to face his former club, Pellegrini insists Sterling will have nothing to prove to Liverpool or their supporters.\n\n\"I don't think he has anything to prove,\" Pellegrini said. \"For him, that motivation is very good. I hope he will be focused just on having a good performance and not thinking about the boos he receives during the game or what happened in the past. He is now a Manchester City player and he will try to win for us.\"\n\nSterling, who has scored 10 goals in all competitions for City this season, faces a torrid reception from the Liverpool fans, having claimed he left Anfield to \"win trophies and play in finals\". But Pellegrini insists he has no complaints about Sterling's contribution so far at City.\n\n\"If we win a couple of titles and Raheem has an important performance, it will be a good season for him,\" the manager said. \"But I don't think it's good to analyse his season in this moment. He has done good things, bad things and was very important the other day [against Dynamo Kiev]. He is a very young player so must improve every year.\n\n\"If you ask me if I'm happy to bring him here this year then yes, I am very happy. He continues to improve and give a lot of things to our squad.\n\n\"For every player, it is never comfortable to play against an old team. Everyone has links, friends inside the club. But he is a professional player. He came here to win titles and I'm sure he will have a very good performance.\"\n\nMore about: Capital One Cup Liverpool FC Manchester City", "BERLIN - Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place in the Bundesliga on Friday with a 1-0 victory at Cologne.\n\nVisitors Hertha were without a win in five but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored two minutes before half-time to hand Pal Dardai's side their first league victory of 2016.\n\nHertha moved four points clear of fourth-place Bayer Leverkusen, while Cologne stayed ninth in the table after suffering a second straight defeat.\n\nLeaders Bayern Munich travel to Wolfsburg on Saturday while Borussia Dortmund, who trail Pep Guardiola's team by eight points, host relegation-threatened Hoffenheim on Sunday.", "Xabi Alonso has rejected claims from a state prosecutor that he defrauded the Spanish tax office to the tune of $4.6 million.\n\nProsecutor Jose Javier Polo asked a judge to investigate the tax affairs of Bayern Munich midfielder Alonso on Friday, claiming that his office had uncovered evidence of fraudulent activity between 2009 and 2011, while Alonso played for Real Madrid.\n\nAlonso responded with a lengthy statement published on his official Facebook profile, with the most salient point being: \"[Alonso] reiterates with absolute clarity that he has always fulfilled and continues to meet with each and every one of his tax obligations.\"\n\nLast month, Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano, a former team-mate of Alonso at Liverpool, was convicted of failing to declare earnings totalling $2.3 million in 2011 and 2012.\n\nMascherano reached a financial settlement with Spanish authorities.", "Arsene Wenger has conceded his Arsenal side must find a quick answer to their lack of goals in recent weeks.\n\nThe Gunners go into the weekend two points off the top of the Premier League and travel to face long-term adversaries Manchester United on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWenger saw his side blow the Red Devils apart with a scintillating start to their meeting at the Emirates Stadium in October - scoring all three goals in their 3-0 win inside the opening 19 minutes.\n\nBut, with six goals in their last eight games in all competitions, such a performance has not looked close to materialising of late.\n\nIn the last week, Wenger has seen his side held to a 0-0 draw by Sky Bet Championship side Hull in the FA Cup fifth round and then lose 2-0 to Barcelona in their Champions League last-16 clash on Tuesday night.\n\nThey go to Old Trafford having won their last league game in the dying embers of a clash with leaders Leicester, with former United forward Danny Welbeck grabbing the injury-time winner.\n\nWenger will be hoping his return can add more goals to a faltering frontline having admitted he is concerned by Arsenal's form in front of goal.\n\n\"That's a good question - and it's a bad answer,\" he replied when asked why his team had stopped scoring.\n\n\"If I had an obvious answer....

We are in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, we are in the next round of the Europa League, we are fifth in the Premier League.\n\n\"It is not so bad as some people say. I hope the fans understand that. When I walk in the street in my village, they are all positive. That keeps me in a good spirit because the fans are telling mostly the truth.\n\n\"Not always in the stadium, because a lot of people are doing something and they follow. But in the street it is one against one - not against, but with each other in the street.\"\n\nLouis van Gaal insists most of the fans are still with him\n\nAsked why United were so bad against Sunderland and Midtjylland, in the first game in Denmark, but so impressive against Shrewsbury in the FA Cup and against the Danes in the second leg, Van Gaal accused the media of stirring thing up for him.\n\n\"It's football, you can win, lose or draw,\" Van Gaal replied. \"The media is inconsistent. That's different.\n\n\"Yeah, Sunderland we didn't lose because of the media, that is true. But the media makes it bigger than it is. Manchester City lost 5-1 against Chelsea, and what was [that] then?\n\n\"You say they played a second team, and what am I doing now? It is unbelievable [the criticism I have received].\n\n\"But we don't lose with such a [big] difference. You have to analyse the results of Manchester United. We have only lost one game 3-0, to Arsenal and they're on another level, in my opinion.\"\n\nUnited entertain Arsenal on Sunday and Van Gaal believes they are the best team in the country, even though they are behind Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur in the table.\n\nHe will have to send out another patched-up side after handing both Joe Riley and Marcus Rashford their first-team debuts in the thrilling win over Midtjylland.\n\nIndeed, if van Gaal is replaced at the end of the season, he could well leave a positive legacy because of the number of young players who have developed into first-team players under him. Certainly, history might be kinder to the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager, than the present.\n\n\"I shall never use youth for myself, only to improve the team,\" Van Gaal said. \"I have a philosophy, for example, that I don't want big squads because then you cannot give youngsters a chance.\n\nMarcus Rashford has shot into the spotlight\n\n\"Now, because of that, you see a lot of youngsters who can show their quality, and you can also win. But it's a big risk.\n\n\"Manchester United also want to give youngsters a chance. It is in the culture of Manchester United. We are doing that but we have had a lot of bad luck this year.\"\n\nVan Gaal has also challenged Memphis Depay, who was man of the match in Europe in midweek, to use that performance as a benchmark for what is expected from him after a difficult first season in England.\n\nLouis van Gaal has urged Memphis Depay (left) to prove himself\n\n\"I hope this is the benchmark for him,\" said Van Gaal. \"He has to make steps forward in his process. He's still a young player like Martial and Lingard, Varela and Riley. They are stepping up in the process, like Morgan Schneiderlin.\n\n\"Nobody is talking about Schneiderlin, but he played his best match on Thursday. Far out, his best match. I'm happy for Morgan Schneiderlin also.\"", "Shaken after sloppily letting a two goal Champions League advantage slip at Juventus, league-leaders Bayern Munich return to Bundesliga business with a trip to Wolfsburg.\n\n\"It's a very, very important week. We can take a huge step forward,\" said coach Pep Guardiola at today's press conference.\n\nThe Volkswagen-backed side proved the Bavarians nearest \"challengers\" (using the term loosely) last season, finishing runners-up a mere 10 points in arrears. It's probably no consolation to the rest of the league, but it's the narrowest margin from any of the past three seasons (25 in Jupp Heynckes' treble year and 19 in Pep Guardiola's debut year). It's more of a chasm between the two this season. With a win tomorrow, Bayern (59) will have garnered twice as many points as Wolfsburg (31) this season.\n\nBorussia Dortmund have taken over the mantle as the Bavarians sole rivals this season. BVB host Guardiola's men next Saturday and, despite an impressive season under new coach Thomas Tuchel, languish eight points behind. Bayern have dropped just seven points all season and look well set for an historic fourth title in a row.\n\nThe last Bundesliga meeting against Wolfsburg was a memorable one with Robert Lewandowski propelling himself into the Guinness Book of Records with his astounding five-goal blitz in nine minutes. The Polish striker sealed the quickest hat trick in Bundesliga history, the fastest four and five goal burst, as well as the most goals as a substitute with his scoring feats. Don't forget Lewandowski came on at half-time with his side trailing 1-0 in Munich in September.\n\nPep wouldn't be pushed on whether the Bundesliga's top scorer (22 goals) will start on Saturday. \"We'll have to see\", the Catalan said.\n\nHowever, Dieter Hecking's charges will provide a stern challenge on their own patch, having lost just once all season in the league to BVB. Bayern will, no doubt, still have painful memories of their last Bundesliga trip to Wolfsburg when they were caught cold immediately after the winter break. At least there'll be no Kevin De Bruyne to inspire the home side this time around.\n\nThe talented Belgian moved to Manchester City, where a current Bayern trainer will take charge next season. Incidentally, that resounding 4-1 win in January 2015 remains big-spending Wolfsburg's only success in 13 attempts against the Bavarians -- losing 11 in total to the tune of five scored and 30 against. Shorn of the services of KDB, the \"Wolves\" may find themselves hunted down again in the North tomorrow.\n\nImportantly for Bayern, the injury \"crisis\" shows signs of abating with a few long-term absentees slowly trickling back to full fitness. Franck Ribery may get his first start of the year after impressing as a substitute against Darmstadt and Juventus. The Frenchman could replace Douglas Costa, who has looked short of his best after winter hibernation.\n\nMario Gotze, an unused sub in Turin, is another star looking for game time as Bayern head into the business end of the season. Guardiola said, \"Perhaps he'll play 90 minutes tomorrow,\" will have been music to the World Cup Final winning goal-scorer's ears.\n\nMedhi Benatia also came on as a substitute in midweek, but Bayern conceded the equaliser a minute later. A mere coincidence perhaps, but the injury-prone Moroccan has to start stringing some minutes together with the crunch second leg against Juventus looming.\n\nBayern have already pummelled Wolfsburg in their own manor this season, winning 3-1 in the second round of the German Cup in one of the most complete away performances of the campaign.\n\nSaturday's \"Dance with the Wolves\" sees a reunion with Dante after his summer transfer window departure. Despite Guardiola often wishing that he had \"1000 Dantes\" in his squad, the central defender never really prospered under the Catalan's tutelage. The Brazilian often found himself the coach's scapegoat for any collective defensive frailty and a move to pastures new was the only logical consequence. Ironically, if Dante had stayed around, he might have been the first name on the team-sheet at the moment, given the dearth of fit central defenders at the club.\n\nDante, a treble-winner under Heynckes in 2013, is guaranteed a warm welcome by the travelling Bayern faithful.\n\n\"It's still very much a special game for me. I've not been gone from Munich too long and I've still got loads of friends there,\" the popular Brazilian revealed.\n\nLuis Gustavo is another ex-Bayern star who'll be keen to impress against his former side. The Brazilian midfielder proved to be Louis van Gaal's final signing in January 2011 before the Dutchman was unceremoniously shown the door three months later.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how Bayern react to the disappointing final 30 minutes in Turin. Bayern let slip an almost certain Champions League quarterfinal berth, snatching a draw from the clutches of victory with some defensive sloppiness. Coasting after Thomas Muller's opener and a trademark Arjen Robben goal in a brilliant hour, Bayern undid most of the good work with a na\u00efve finale. Midfielder Joshua Kimmich, pressed into service as an emergency centre-half, shouldered much of the blame for the first goal. But, it's unfair to single out the raw 21-year-old for too much criticism. After all, he's still so young and inexperienced and playing out of position.\n\nManuel Neuer should perhaps reflect on Juve's equaliser. In hindsight, Bayern's keeper would have been better served launching the ball into row Z of the grandstand to relieve heavy Juventus pressure, instead of pleasing his trainer and playing an intricate pass to an under-pressure colleague, in this case skipper Philipp Lahm.\n\nThat said, there's no room for doom and gloom. You still have to fancy Bayern's chances of disposing of the \"Old Lady.\" Bayern are riding the crest of a wave at fortress Allianz Arena, with nine wins in a row at home in the European elite competition and a further 11 home victories in a row in the Bundesliga this season.

Celebrations are far from my mind at the moment.\"", "The German manager's motivational work for the cup final against Manchester City includes showing his players a montage of Liverpool's eight League Cup victories, a record, before the club's 12th final appearance\n\nIt took 147 weeks for J\u00fcrgen Klopp to build Borussia Dortmund into Bundesliga champions and claim the first trophy of his managerial career in Germany. His latest work will not be completed by the Capital One Cup but the process of turning doubt into belief at Liverpool would be galvanised should Klopp deliver after merely 143 days in England.\n\n\"I am not really sure,\" said the 48-year-old on the long-term implications of beating Manchester City on Sunday. \"But I am long enough in the business to know I am greedy for success.\"\n\nThe proven appetite that persuaded Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, to make the most ambitious and important appointment of their tenure in October does have limits. Klopp rejected the offer of personalised, replica trophies to mark the two league titles, one German Cup and two Supercups he won at Dortmund and not because they cost \u20ac3,000 apiece. The moment was enough.\n\nOf more importance was enabling a fallen Champions League winner to compete again, and creating a unified atmosphere between players and supporters en route. It explains why Klopp called for compromise at Liverpool over the ticket price row that sparked allegations of a different kind of greed at FSG from angry supporters. And why he opened his Anfield reign by looking into the LFC TV cameras to tell those same supporters: \"We have to change from doubter to believer. Now.\"\n\nIt has been an arduous, educational start at times as seven wins from 18 Premier League games and miserable defeats at Newcastle United, West Ham United and Watford testify. Faith in Klopp has not been dented. No one expected an immediate transformation (except the journalist who asked whether Liverpool could win the league following October's 3-1 win at Chelsea) but the Capital One Cup final offers opportunity to strengthen belief in the way ahead. Silverware would also not harm the allure of Klopp when, as appears likely, Liverpool enter the transfer market this summer without Champions League football to offer.\n\nThe Liverpool manager says: \"It is a chance to turn doubters into believers but hopefully not the only one. If we say they are all believers if we win and they stay doubters if we don't then it means the house is really built on sand. It is always the same problem at clubs with a big history like Liverpool if they are not successful in the present. Then you need the right decisions, then the right patience, then you can get back on track. With all the circumstances, with all the big clubs around with a lot of money, we should not go the same way. We have to go our way, how Liverpool always did. This win would help. It would help to win the Capital One Cup but it is not the only possibility for everyone to believe in this way.\"\n\nFive current Premier League managers have won a major honour in English football - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Guus Hiddink, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Steve McClaren and Sunday's opponent, Manuel Pellegrini. The rest will look on enviously should Klopp make it six so quickly. His first trophy was secured with Dortmund on 30 April 2011 with a 2-0 win over N\u00fcrnberg but it was promotion to the top flight with Mainz seven years earlier, following near-misses in 2002 and 2003, that he considers the breakthrough.\n\n\"I was surprised,\" he recalls of the first Bundesliga title. \"I thought it would be completely different. I never changed, I am sorry to say, but the whole world around me changed. They said 'the German champion' - I didn't think they meant me - or 'the double winner' or 'the Champions League finalist'. That is not how I work. I want to win the next game, really, with all I have and then we will see how it feels.\n\n\"If my first success was promotion with Mainz then I really had to learn the hard way. To not get what you want twice and to then have to go a third time, that was hard. I have had to be patient enough to wait for the right title, but then what is the right title? We only have one to win now and that is what we want to do. I want to win this title, but I won't take it for myself. In Germany if you win a title you can make a replica of it. I never did it. I have it in my head instead. You can pay \u20ac3,000 for a replica and then you own your own cup but I don't need this. If we do it - great, but I don't want to make the pressure too high.\"\n\nSteven Gerrard believes Klopp's pedigree and tactical approach - to the fore in Liverpool's 4-1 win at City in November - will make the difference on Sunday. \"I gave him \u00a3100 to say that,\" responded the Stuttgart-born coach. \"I'm not sure I'm the difference but I know the way, that's true.\"\n\nNot that Liverpool require guidance on winning this competition. Klopp's motivational work for the cup final includes showing his players a montage of Liverpool's past League Cup victories - eight in total, a record - before the club's 12th final appearance, another record. He has not lost in three meetings with City or in three encounters against Pellegrini. \"Beat them when you meet them,\" he says.\n\nKlopp described playing at Wembley as \"the best thing you can do in football\" before the semi-final shootout win over Stoke City but both he and Liverpool have sour memories of their last visits. The manager's only previous experience ended in a wry smile and bear-hug for Jupp Heynckes after Bayern Munich won an enthralling all-German Champions League final in 2013 with an 89th-minute goal against Dortmund. In terms of wealth and, in the case of Raheem Sterling, luring away a club's best young talent, City represent a similar obstacle. \"We will not have an Italian referee this time,\" he said, still smarting at Nicola Rizzoli's refusal to show the Bayern defender Dante a second yellow card.\n\nHe adds: \"Remember, we had the right plan for that game. For the first half an hour we had them the way no other team had them the whole season. We will have an idea for City and if we do this we will be in the game for sure. It will not be easy for City.\n\n\"Sometimes it is the quality of one player who decides the game. I love this game. It is more about the performance of the whole team. If you look at big titles in the past: Denmark were European Champions, I don't know when, and that is the best title I ever heard about. They met each other at McDonalds, then they heard they had to go to the European Championships and then they won the title. That is cool. Greece under Otto Rehhagel too. It is not always the best team that should win. Everybody can win if you have the right idea and if you are full of trust.\"\n\nLiverpool failed to show for their last appearance at Wembley, last season's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa that ensured Brendan Rodgers would be the club's first manager since Phil Taylor in the 1950s not to win a trophy in his first three seasons.\n\n\"I have had to accept a few times in my life that it is not decisive even if you want to win with all you have but, for sure, we will go to the final and try and achieve this,\" Klopp said. \"It is more important for the club, the crowd, the players and of course I would enjoy it with all I have but my job in a final is not to say to the players: 'You have to give your all.' It is a final - everybody will give their all.\"", "Berlin (AFP) - Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place in the Bundesliga on Friday with a 1-0 victory at Cologne.\n\nVisitors Hertha were without a win in five but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored two minutes before half-time to hand Pal Dardai's side their first league victory of 2016.\n\nHertha moved four points clear of fourth-place Bayer Leverkusen, while Cologne stayed ninth in the table after suffering a second straight defeat.\n\nLeaders Bayern Munich travel to Wolfsburg on Saturday while Borussia Dortmund, who trail Pep Guardiola's team by eight points, host relegation-threatened Hoffenheim on Sunday.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nHertha end winless run at Cologne - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "COLOGNE, Germany -- Hertha Berlin won 1-0 in Cologne in the Bundesliga on Friday to snap a five-match winless run and move another step closer to a Champions League slot.\n\nVedad Ibisevic scored in the 43rd minute following a pass from Salomon Kalou to secure the victory that strengthened Berlin's grip on third place.\n\nCologne's defense left Ibisevic unmarked and the striker easily slotted home from inside the box.\n\nCologne's striker Anthony Modeste hit the post late in the match as it shed its caution to try to salvage a point.\n\nBerlin is the surprise team of the championship, having barely escaped relegation last season.

(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Tony Jimenez)", "It's been a difficult few weeks for Manuel Pellegrini but the chance to become arguably the most successful manager in City's history remains within reach.\n\nThe Chilean will leave City in the summer and despite some poor recent performances which have seen his side slip behind in the Premier League title race and exit the FA Cup, there's still plenty for him to achieve before he departs.\n\nHe's chasing Joe Mercer's record. Mercer enjoyed a wonderful six-year tenure at City and is widely regarded as the finest manager the club have ever had.\n\nIt started with promotion from the Second Division in his first season and once in the top flight, Mercer's City never looked back.\n\nHe led them to the title in 1968, won the FA Cup in 1969 and the League Cup in 1970. He also managed European success - winning the 1970 Cup Winners' Cup - making his time at the helm by far the most decorated period in City's history.\n\nBut, for some, Pellegrini could usurp Mercer. He secured City's first league-and-cup double in his debut season in charge and has the chance to add a third trophy to his collection on Sunday when City face Liverpool in the League Cup final.\n\nVictory in that game would leave him with three major trophies, with City still in the race for the Premier League title. They sit six points off the top, with 12 games remaining.\n\nIf his side can leapfrog Leicester, Tottenham and Arsenal and win the title in May, he would have won as many trophies as Mercer in half the time it took the Cheshire-born boss.\n\nThe fact Mercer also won a promotion and oversaw European glory, means, for many, Pellegrini would have to win the Champions League before he exits to be considered superior. That seems unlikely given the quality of the teams left in the draw, with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich far stronger than City as it stands.\n\nFor others, two Premier League titles and two League Cups in just three years would represent a better effort than Mercer and place him at the top of the City's list of greatest managers.\n\nIt's going to take a huge effort, though. His squad has looked stretched in recent weeks and the team has underachieved for much of the campaign. Three consecutive defeats at the hands of Leicester, Tottenham and Chelsea highlighted City's limitations. The fact they haven't won a game in the league against a top-five side is a damning indictment of their season.\n\nBut Wednesday's win in Kiev, which saw them play with an intensity that's been missing for months, suggests all is not lost. It was City's most accomplished performance since the 3-1 win against Sevilla in the Champions League in November.\n\nIt was no coincidence that City's core of top-class players were involved. It's a rare sight to see Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero together but when they are City are a formidable side.\n\nIf Pellegrini can keep that nucleus of talent and experience fit, the idea City can get themselves back in the title race isn't that fanciful.\n\nWatch: Rob Pollard on City and the League Cup\n\nA win on Sunday against Liverpool at Wembley feels hugely important in their quest. A trophy this early in the season lays a platform for further success. City used their League Cup win in 2014 to boost their title chances and Chelsea repeated the trick last season.\n\nIt would be just the fillip the City squad needs after turbulent and inconsistent season. It's a competition some look down on, the poor relation of the FA Cup, but it's one that's been a huge part of City's past. They've won it three times and been runners-up once.\n\nEveryone connected to the club wants another one on Sunday, including Pellegrini, who will edge closer to Mercer if he can lead his side to victory over Liverpool in front of 90,000 people on Sunday.", "MADRID (AP) - A Spanish state prosecutor on Friday asked a judge to open an investigation into alleged tax evasion by former Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso.\n\nProsecutor Jose Javier Polo told The Associated Press he asked a judge to investigate Alonso after his office found \"evidence\" pointing to Alonso having defrauded Spain's tax office of 3 million euros ($3.3 million) from 2009-11.\n\nIt will now be a judge's decision to open a case or not.\n\nAlonso joined Real Madrid from Liverpool in 2009 and played for the team until moving to Bayern Munich in 2014.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAlonso posted a statement on his Facebook page on Friday saying he \"has always complied and will continue to comply with each and every of his fiscal obligations.\"\n\nIn January, Javier Mascherano, a Barcelona midfielder and Alonso's former teammate at Liverpool, was convicted of not properly paying taxes.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

seven goals and is prepared to fight for his future having turned down a big-money move to China in the transfer window.", "Manchester United are set to open discussions to improve Marcus Rashford's contract after his spectacular rise to prominence at Old Trafford.\n\nThe striker has scored four goals in his first two senior games for the club, having been given his chance by manager Louis van Gaal.\n\nRashford, 18, scored twice on his debut against Midtjylland in the Europa League last Thursday, and followed that up with two more goals on Sunday as Arsenal were beaten 3-2 in the Premier League.\n\nVan Gaal is keen to protect the Manchester-born forward's development, and is wary of asking him to take too much responsibility too soon.\n\nHowever, there is an acknowledgement at the club that Rashford's remarkable progress is worth a better contract.\n\nThe striker currently earns \u00a31,000 a week, but talks with the player's representatives are expected to take place regarding a new deal more in line with the club's first-team players.\n\nUnited hope that the offer of a new contract worth around \u00a320,000 a week will keep Rashford at Old Trafford until 2020, and aim to secure an agreement before the end of the season.\n\nThe striker has been making an impression in United's junior sides for some time, performing well in the UEFA Youth League earlier this season, but even Van Gaal has admitted to a degree of surprise at how well he has adapted to the senior team.\n\nUnited's manager had indicated that he was reluctant to start Rashford against Arsenal, but did so after Anthony Martial failed to recover from the hamstring injury he suffered during the warm-up against Midtjylland last Thursday.\n\nRashford's performance on Sunday has made it near impossible for Van Gaal to leave him out for tomorrow's Premier League home game against Watford.\n\nThe manager, though, will not continue to play the forward if he feels that a break is needed.\n\nVan Gaal has a proud history of developing players at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and has stated that he wants to leave a legacy of young talent for United's next manager when he leaves Old Trafford.\n\nAs it stands, the Dutchman is set to depart the club when his contract expires in 2017, but he may yet leave this summer after a season that has not lived up to expectations.\n\nAt Ajax, Van Gaal brought through Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids and Patrick Kluivert while developing a team who won the 1995 Champions League while playing some sublime football.\n\nHe was also instrumental in the progress from the youth set-up of Victor Valdes, Andres Iniesta and Xavi at Barcelona, and introduced Thomas Muller, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber while at Bayern Munich.\n\nVan Gaal has given debuts to six United academy graduates during the month of February alone, and while some of those selections have been driven by a lengthy first-team injury list, it does suggest that there are talented young players ready to be given a chance at Old Trafford.\n\nThe club's youth set-up has been subjected to rigorous analysis over the last 12 months, following an internal review set up by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.\n\nThat review was sparked by concerns that a relative lack of funding at youth level had damaged United's ability to attract the best young players.\n\nIt resulted in Nicky Butt being confirmed in the role as head of the club's academy, and he began with a pledge to find the next Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes or Gary Neville.\n\nFormer England midfielder Butt, who graduated through the United youth set-up with Giggs, Neville and Scholes as part of the revered Class of '92, is aware that heavy academy investment at Manchester City has made the job of bringing in top-class youthful talent much tougher.", "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been promised backing for a major transfer spree to rejuvenate the Liverpool squad this summer.\n\n* This Liverpool team is constantly shown it is not yet good enough\n\nThe manager will have more resources than any of his Anfield predecessors when he comes to revamp the underperforming squad at the end of the season, with the Capital One Cup final disappointment having underlined the side's limitations.\n\nLiverpool have no set budget, but the impact of the new Premier League TV deal will give Klopp the money he needs to take the make-up of the side in any direction he deems necessary.\n\nLiverpool were disappointing at Wembley on Sunday\n\nAlthough the German coach has spoken at length about giving the players he inherited an opportunity - and many still have time to redeem themselves in the Europa League - that is not going to prevent significant moves in the transfer market.\n\nPlayers of the calibre of Bayern Munich's Mario G\u00f6tze, who Klopp managed at Borussia Dortmund, is on the manager's list of targets, although it would take all his powers of persuasion to convince the German World Cup winner to leave a club competing in the Champions League for Anfield.\n\nMario G\u00f6tze worked with Klopp at Borussia Dortmund before he joined Bayern\n\nLiverpool also tried to sign Polish international Piotr Zieli\u0144ski in January, the midfielder currently on loan to Empoli from Udinese. The Merseyside club will try to revive that deal this summer. Udinese are owned by the Watford owner, Giampaolo Pozzo, and Liverpool were trying to negotiate a deal for 21-year-old Zieli\u0144ski that would see Anfield striker Jerome Sinclair move to Vicarage Road.\n\nKlopp is also interested in Leicester City's 18-year-old left-back, Ben Chilwell, while a new goalkeeper and striker are also priorities. With Joel Matip and Marko Grujic already secured for the start of next season, Klopp could quite comfortably go beyond the seven new recruits that have become customary every summer at Anfield for the last few years as he seeks the right balance in his squad.\n\nSimon Mignolet has made a series of mistakes that may lead to him losing his first-choice status\n\nThe repercussions for those playing for their futures could not be clearer, despite the consistent backing they have received since Klopp took over from Brendan Rodgers.\n\nSimon Mignolet recently signed a five-year-deal but might find himself relegated to number two by pre-season. Full-back Alberto Moreno has continuously failed to impress under the new manager and none of the centre-backs has stood out as a defensive leader.\n\nThe most glaring problem surrounds the future of striker Christian Benteke, who despite costing Liverpool \u00a332.5 million could not find his way off the bench against Manchester City in the League Cup final.\n\nChristian Benteke coast Liverpool \u00a332.5 million, but he has failed to impress Klopp\n\nKlopp has shown little faith in the striker since taking over, but the player himself has indicated he wants to prove his manager wrong and show his worth.\n\nBenteke rejected the chance to leave Liverpool in January - the Chinese Super League expressed an interest - and he will have a decision to make in the summer if his career is not to stagnate.\n\nDivock Origi has shown promise but Klopp will not go into next season relying on the fitness of Daniel Sturridge in a team that suffer from a chronic inability to score goals. He is targeting players of pace in attack, and needs more leadership and composure at the back. Liverpool's most impressive centre-half this season has proven to be Lucas Leiva - a midfielder deployed in an emergency role.\n\nDivock Origi came off the banch at Wembley and showed glimpses of promise\n\nMany Liverpool players will be assessing those coming in and contemplating what it will mean for their futures. Klopp said earlier in the season how all relationships between players and clubs are reconsidered at the end of a campaign - either the club or the player deciding it is time to part company.\n\nCaptain Jordan Henderson expects the manager to add new faces. \"I do think he will want to make his own stamp on the transfer market with players that he brings in. That would be the case with any manager really.\n\n\"I'm sure he will be looking at players to bring in this summer to strengthen the team to make us better and give us more chance of winning trophies,\" he said.\n\nJon Flanagan has some big decisions to make this summer\n\nOne pressing concern is the future of the only senior Liverpool-born player in the squad, Jon Flanagan, who is out of contract in the summer.\n\nHenderson says it is imperative his future is resolved. \"It's huge that it gets sorted out,\" said Henderson. \"You have people like him and Stevie [Gerrard] and Carra who have come through the academy and the fans feel as though they are one of them, which they are.\"\n\nAnfield changes: Summer moves\n\nIN\n\nMario G\u00f6tze (Bayern Munich): Would be a marquee signing to excite fans.

A day after Vicente del Bosque had delivered the league title to the Bernabeu, the Real Madrid manager was sacked by Florentino Perez. The reason given by the Real president: \"He was showing signs of exhaustion... our belief was that he was not the right man for the future.\"\n\nFans would disagree and Del Bosque's ready smile is even readier when quizzed about what happened that evening after a 29th Liga victory had been secured. All in the past, water under the bridge and so on. A World Cup, a European Championship and the Spanish equivalent of a knighthood later, the huevo is very much on the face of the man who sacked him.\n\nAfter Del Bosque's tenure, which reaped two Ligas and two Champions Leagues (one of which was won under previous president Lorenzo Sanz), Perez's reign in the boardroom heralded a drought that would last until he fell on his sword towards the end of the 2005-06 season. His successor, Ramon Calderon, would not oversee a presidency lacking in controversy but he did secure back-to-back titles as well as the preliminary agreement to bring Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu.\n\nPerez was more than happy to take the credit for that but will he now assume responsibility for the side's disappointing last two years? It's hardly likely.\n\nPerez has been elected Real president on two consecutive occasions largely because of the club statutes. He also recently toughened those criteria to include a clause that anybody wishing to challenge his throne also had to prove a 25-year, card-carrying allegiance to the club, in addition to a &euro50 million bank guarantee. The list of people in crisis-hit Spain who can meet that first amendment is slim. There are plenty of socios with 25 years' service but without a cool \u20ac50 million to hand. It appears as though Perez has basically orchestrated a lifetime term.\n\nA group of Real socios is pursuing the legal validity of Perez's tweaking of the rules for presidential elections but in all reality, it will take more than the courts to dislodge the incumbent. It will take a serious challenger (of which there are none) or the presidential acknowledgement of a club firmly run aground. Perez shows few signs of admitting his mistakes. Like the captain of the Titanic, he seems happier to go down with the ship. It is pure hubris.\n\nThe players he claims to represent are already eyeing the life rafts. Cristiano Ronaldo's words after the derby defeat to Atletico can be interpreted in a dozen different ways. One of the simplest is that he wants out and was fluttering his eyelashes at Paris Saint-Germain, a possible suitor. Another is that he has had enough of the constant posturing of \"El Presi.\"\n\nCarlo Ancelotti opined recently about his former employer. \"Is it always the manager's fault?\" Carlo would know; in the summer of 2014, Real Madrid sacked the Italian, winner of the Decima and two previous European crowns at Milan in addition to league titles in three different leagues.\n\nThe reason given by the Real president? \"I don't know.\" Well, to appoint Rafa Benitez, obviously, but that lasted six months. Will Zidane last longer or will Perez stick to his rather stringent remit of winning at least one title a season? It is certainly a tough demand on a manager operating under a president whose own record in that respect is far from stellar.\n\nZidane has fallen into the trap that eventually ensnares all Real managers extremely early in his tenure. Perez wanted all his toys to feature in Saturday's big game and as has been the case so often in recent seasons, it was the side's undoing. Playing James Rodriguez and Isco together essentially reduces Real to 10 men, such are their common weaknesses in both ball retention and tracking back.\n\nRodriguez made an effort in defence against Diego Simeone's side but without a genuine defensive midfielder, Real were always going to be on the back foot against Gabi and Augusto Fernandez. Casemiro, the only Real midfielder willing to go toe-to-toe in the Calderon derby under Benitez (a 1-1 draw) didn't even make it off the bench.\n\nWhen it comes to managers, it's always one step forward and two back under Perez. Del Bosque was not the right man. Ancelotti was not the right man. Zidane apparently is, until he inevitably won't be. That may happen this summer, but who will Perez turn to then? He has wrecked relationships with every major manager in the game. Manuel Pellegrini, who guided Real to second behind Barcelona with a record points total, was discarded. He subsequently took Malaga to the brink of the Champions League semifinals and won the Premier League for Manchester City.\n\nAncelotti was gratefully snapped up by Bayern Munich after Pep Guardiola announced he was off to the Etihad. None of these proven winners will touch the Bernabeu with a barge pole as long as Perez remains.\n\nThe current Real president likes to talk of change, momentum and shake-ups. To date, Perez has only served to consistently ensure inconsistency. If he really cares about the club and not his own personal gain in running it, the time has come to take a step back... or to step down entirely. Perez can only wash his hands so often: blame eventually has to fall at his door for another wasted Liga season.", "Jurgen Klopp has been given the signal to oversee another summer of significant change at Anfield as he looks to revive Liverpool's fortunes.\n\nFenway Sports Group, Liverpool's owners, will provide Klopp with the finances he needs to bring in the new faces that are required to turn a squad that is struggling to qualify for Europe and lost the Capital One Cup final into a serious force.\n\nKlopp, who has already secured the signing of defender Joel Matip from Schalke and Serbia Under-21 midfielder Marko Grujic, had been adamant that a raft of new faces would not arrive but an overhaul of the playing staff will take place during the summer.\n\nLiverpool owners FSG have given Jurgen Klopp the green light to overhaul the squad this summer\n\nLiverpool players watch the penalty shootout unfold in their Capital One Cup final defeat by Manchester City\n\nLiverpool, who have been linked with Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze, are anxious to recruit the Poland midfielder Piotr Zielinski and FSG have made it clear to Klopp that they will back his every decision; it is expected to include Lazar Markovic being brought back from his loan at Fenerbahce.\n\nIt is inevitable, too, that there will be an exodus of players from the current squad.\n\nChristian Benteke, last summer's heading grabbing arrival at \u00a332.5million, faces an increasingly uncertain future, with Klopp failing to use him against Augsburg in the Europa League and in the penalty shootout defeat to Manchester City.\n\nBenteke is determined to fight to change Klopp's mind.

In Spain, Cristiano Ronaldo was in hot water again after a post-game tirade, while Paris Saint-Germain is going through a bit of a wobbly patch in France, seeing its record unbeaten streak get snapped.\n\nBarcelona's unbeaten run, however, continued, while Juventus continues to steamroll the opposition in Italy. In the Bundesliga, there is a new team in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nHere is what caught our eye this week Around Europe:\n\nRonaldo outburst adds to Madrid tension\n\nAtletico Madrid beat Real Madrid for the third time running at the Bernabeu-for the first time in history-and decisively knocked its rival out of La Liga's title running. Real Madrid is now 12 points behind Barcelona at the top, while Atletico is once again over-performing under Diego Simeone.\n\nThe problems for Real Madrid begin with the president Florentino Perez, whose flawed transfer policy and micro-management with the coach goes some way to explaining the club's return of one league title in the last seven years. Now it's in a battle for third spot with Villarreal, only two points back. Finish fourth and Madrid will have to play in Champions League qualifying, and miss a lucrative preseason tour, something that really will get Perez in a flap.\n\nFans and now local media are turning against Perez. \"Florentino resign,\" was the chant from the home fans again.\n\nPlanet Futbol Champions League: Real Madrid, Wolfsburg win first legs on road by Liviu Bird 0 0 0 0 0 0 More \"It seems to make no difference whether [Rafa] Benitez or [Zinedine] Zidane sits on the bench,\" wrote Marca. \"The excuses are wearing thin for the players. And for Florentino Perez.\"\n\nThe only chance to salvage something out of the season will be in the Champions League. But the mood will not have brightened after Cristiano Ronaldo's post-match interview, in which he seemingly complained that his teammates were not good enough.\n\n\"We're missing Karim [Benzema], Pepe, Marcelo, [Gareth] Bale, and it's difficult,\" Ronaldo said. \"The others who played are not as good. Any team needs its best players. I'm not saying Danilo, Jese, Lucas [Vazquez] and [Mateo] Kovacic are not good, but those who are missing are very good. You say I'm playing badly, but I'm scoring goals, in the Champions League nobody is close to me. You say Cristiano has dropped, so Madrid has dropped. No. If all the players had my level, we'd be top of the table, maybe. My numbers don't lie.\"\n\nOh dear. Cue captain Sergio Ramos coming out to say he expressed himself badly, and Ronaldo's entourage rushing out a statement saying he was misunderstood (\"I don't believe myself is better than anyone... I was referring to injuries to players like Pepe, Bale, Benzema, Marcelo...\")\n\nMORE: Barcelona VP calls out Ronaldo for lashing out on teammates\n\nAdd to that some heavy criticism from Zidane, who said the problem was not physical but mental, and warned that some players-as well as himself-have their futures on the line. Perez is going to have to be smart in the summer, especially as a transfer embargo is expected to fall on Madrid for the 12 months after it. Isco and James Rodriguez will be available for transfer; they are just the type of players that would be brilliant in a team that was built around them.

Meet Manchester United's young forward by SI Staff 0 0 0 0 0 0 More It has been a heady time at Old Trafford with the emergence of an 18-year-old center forward, Marcus Rashford, who has scored four goals in his two first-team appearances.\n\nAfter emerging as a Europa League hero, he scored two against Arsenal on his Premier League debut and also set up the winner for Ander Herrera, while showed the pace and finishing skill that United hoped to see from Memphis Depay this season.\n\nRashford is academy graduate No. 14 to make his first-team debut under Louis van Gaal, whose precarious position seems a little (just a little) safer this week. Injuries have forced Van Gaal to throw in the kids this year, with six youngsters getting debuts in the last month. \"Age is not important,\" is one of Van Gaal's common refrains, but in the short-term world of football, it makes things a little trickier.\n\nWATCH: Louis van Fall\n\nThe raft of youngsters emerging comes at a time when Van Gaal has been most under pressure, with speculation mounting that Jose Mourinho will replace him in the summer. Perhaps Van Gaal has thrown caution to the wind and decided to highlight his chief difference to Mourinho for the rest of the season. The best way for fans to connect with the team is to see a local lad who supports the club playing well for it, which is exactly what Rashford is. He started this season in United's Under-18s, has also scored for the Under-19s, Under-21s and now the first team.\n\nWould that have happened under Mourinho? Almost certainly not. (And it almost didn't under Van Gaal; as Rashford only got his chance after Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up before Thursday's game.)\n\nPlanet Futbol Willy Caballero the hero as Man City wins League Cup in shootout by Peter Berlin 0 0 0 0 0 0 More Manchester City also won this weekend, lifting the first trophy of the season after beating Liverpool in the League Cup final on penalties. The hero was City goalkeeper Willy Caballero, derided for his performance last week in a 5-1 Cup loss at Chelsea, who saved three penalties and vindicated Pellegrini's trust in him. The storyline showed just the type of man Pellegrini is; he gave Caballero his word that he would start in the Cup games, and so he did.\n\nCity may be getting an upgrade when it comes to coaching with the arrival of Pep Guardiola next season, but it's hard to think of a manager with a more human side to him than the Chilean.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPSG loses unbeaten run\n\nWhen you are as dominant as PSG has been in France over the last few years, you need to regularly change your ambitions.

From challenging for the title, Inter manager Roberto Mancini is now fighting for Champions League qualification-and his job. Juventus coach Max Allegri has made a habit of getting his subs right of late: Simone Zaza scored against Napoli while Stefano Sturaro came off the bench to equalize against Bayern Munich. In the Derby d'Italia, sub Alvaro Morata scored the late penalty to seal the points.\n\nBefore then, it was a former Inter academy graduate, Leonardo Bonucci, who volleyed his team in front. Juventus has achieved a 21-point swing over Inter since they met 19 games ago. Part of the reason for that is its defense, which has now gone eight league games with conceding-one more shut-out against Atalanta next week will equal a club record set in 1972. With Giorgio Chiellini injured for some of that time, Bonucci has been the rock at the back. Pep Guardiola, after last week's European game at Juventus, said that Bonucci was \"one of my all-time favorite players,\" leading most media to expect a bid from Manchester City to arrive in the summer.\n\nJuventus would be highly resistant to selling. \"BeckenBonucci,\" as La Reppublica called him, is at the heart of this team's success.\n\nHertha Berlin charges toward Champions League\n\nIt will never last, they said. It has to stop soon, they said. No one expects Hertha Berlin to stay in the top three of the Bundesliga this season, so when it went four games without a win this last month, the doom mongers were out in force-except they might be wrong.\n\nWATCH: USA's F. Johnson scores for Monchengladbach again\n\nHertha has a three-point lead over Borussia Monchengladbach after winning 1-0 at Cologne. Salomon Kalou set up the goal for his strike partner Vedad Ibisevic-between them they have 18 out of the club's 31 goals. No team in the top eight has fewer, but the success of Pal Dardai's team is at the back; only Bayern Munich has conceded fewer than its 24 goals (even Dortmund has let in 25).\n\nTop three players of the week\n\nWilly Caballero (Manchester City)\n\nThree penalty saves in a cup final is a great way to repay your coach, and that's what Caballero did Sunday, stopping Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana to give City its first trophy of the season. Caballero is clearly a popular player in the squad-his teammates launched him in the air after the game was won-and now City fans will hold in the same esteem.\n\nMarcus Rashford (Manchester United)\n\nFour goals in the first two games for an 18-year-old at the club he supports? In a Premier League season of unlikely twists and turns, this was the storyline that seemed too good to be true-but Rashford is making it happen.\n\nOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (Rennes)\n\nRennes has jumped into sixth place in Ligue 1 and is one point off third after an astonishing come from behind win inspired by Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, the exciting young winger who set up the first for Kamil Grosicki on 91 minutes, and one minute later scored a dramatic winner. Remember the name.\n\nTop three goals of the week\n\nPierrick Capelle (Angers vs. Guingamp)\n\nThe French midfielder's chest and volley was his last action of the game.

I'm a little bit cautious. These types of injuries have the danger of having a setback regardless of age. These kinds of injuries you must be very careful.\"\n\nHiddink, who also hinted that he is ready to rest Costa, said that although Chelsea's first target has now been reached, avoiding relegation, they are eager to salvage something positive from the campaign.\n\n\"When I started in December we were close to the relegation zone, one point,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course this club must have big targets, but the first objective was as soon as possible to get out of the relegation zone.\n\n\"The team did very well with draws and victories. In a relatively short time we have accomplished that in-between target, which is not the target for Chelsea. That encourages us also to go on.\n\n\"Of course we say when this goal is achieved, this in-between goal, we watch (look) to fifth or other places. But it's rather difficult. We like to go back where Chelsea belong.\n\n\"But it's not hard to motivate them. I'm happy with the attitude in recent weeks and before it was growing in December and January.\n\n\"I'm happy with their attitude in training and in games. We have had some setbacks in the score during games at home and away, e.g. the last game (a 2-1 comeback win at Southampton).\n\n\"They are resilient and they like to come back and score.

Leicester won on Saturday (Leonardo Ulloa's late winner saw the Foxes beat Norwich 1-0) to move five points clear. Arsenal knew they needed to win on Sunday and although they started the game brightly - Mesut Ozil's delicious flick set Nacho Monreal clean through but he shot right at David De Gea to squander a gilt-edged chance -- that urgency soon faded as defensive lapses left them crumpled in a heap.\n\n[ MORE: Player ratings ]\n\nLaurent Koscielny and Gabriel failed to pick up Marcus Rashford as Gabriel's poor clearance was picked up and then swept home by the teenager (much more on him, soon) and then he ghosted in-between the duo in the box to head home and put United 2-0 up in the first half. Defensively, Arsenal were shocking. Would Per Mertesacker's experience have helped? Probably not.\n\nThe Gunners showed some fight with Danny Welbeck scoring to make it 2-1 right on half time, but then they imploded again with poor midfield tracking and a lack of tenacity in the engine room the underlying issue in this defeat. Francis Coquelin left Ander Herrera with far too much time and space on the edge of the box and his deflected effort put United 3-1 up. Still, Mesut Ozil scored to make it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go and there was hope but Arsenal never truly looked like netting an equalizer on a day where star names didn't show up. Big time. Being present in Wenger's press conference after the game, it was clear he was annoyed with the performance. He snarled at suggestions stating that this defeat was his worst-ever to United because of their under-strength team and refused to criticize his senior players who didn't deliver.\n\n[ MORE: Wenger says title hopes still alive ]\n\nOzil had a goal and assist but did little apart from that. Alexis Sanchez struggled to have any influence on the game. Theo Walcott looked lost out wide. Even Petr Cech seemed to be struggling to demand his defense and organize them coherently.\n\nThat was the big issue here and in recent times, it's nothing new. Arsenal last won the title 10 years ago and this season clearly represents their best chance to end that drought. This was meant to be a new Arsenal, a side who could go away from home, sit back and defend then hit teams on the break. They've got better at it, but after putting themselves in a good position their customary end of season charge doesn't look like materializing once again this year. Coquelin and the lightweight, disappointing Aaron Ramsey went missing with Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera all over them to cut off the supply line to Arsenal's underperforming attacking midfield trio of Sanchez, Ozil and Walcott.\n\nWith Arsene Wenger's attacking team selection, he seemed to want to go for the jugular and rub salt in the wounds of a wounded, bitter long-term rival as United had several key players out. It backfired.\n\n\"I think they defended well. Every time we got in the flow they stopped us with little free kicks in the middle of the park,\" Wenger said. \"On set pieces I expected us to do more. We were not dangerous enough.\"\n\nIs Wenger the problem? Many had questioned his \"na\u00efve\" tactics and insistence on playing \"the right way\" over digging in and getting the job done. Those critics will find a fine voice once again after this damaging defeat. Coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's comeback win against Swansea, it is now Spurs who trail Leicester by two points and lead Arsenal by three. The Gunners face Swansea at home on Wednesday and then a huge north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nThis is it. Their title hopes will come down to the next two games. Can they pick themselves up and beat Swansea heading into the biggest derby matches against Spurs in PL history? They need to. Deep down, Wenger knows it.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Wenger said, with shrug. \"We dropped three important points and we have to show we can fight and bounce back on Wednesday night [against Swansea] and not feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nAlthough he hasn't given up on winning the title this season, he knows it's do or die in the next seven days. Arsenal's fans have seen this last chance saloon scenario play out too many times to be surprised. They're already starting to feel sorry for themselves.\n\nUNITED'S YOUNGINS\n\nThe eruption of noise at Old Trafford when Rashford lashed home a shot to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Arsenal on Sunday was unlike anything I've heard in recent times at OT. Perhaps it was the loudest since Sir Alex Ferguson retired...\n\n[ MORE: Rashford on his dream week ]\n\nScratch that. Rashford, 18, struck again in the first half and the noise was even louder. His two goals and assist led United to the win over Arsenal and the teenager, who only made his pro debut four days ago, now has four goals in his first two outings as a United player. Not bad.\n\nThe local lad seemed composed, unfazed and received glowing praise from both managers post-game. His movement was particularly impressive as he peeled away at key moments and didn't panic when two chances dropped his way. He did get lucky with a handball shout at the other end as he appeared to block the ball on the line with his arm, but the way his luck is going right now Craig Pawson missed it.\n\nRashford wasn't the only United youngin to make a scene. This week alone Van Gaal has handed debuts to five players from their academy and since he arrived at United just over 18 months ago he has handed 23 players their debut for the Red Devils. With eight academy products in United's 18-man squad on Sunday, their recently criticized academy does seem to be getting something right. He's always been an advocate of promoting youth players quickly and has had huge success doing it at Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"It is the culture of Manchester United and that is why they take me as a manager,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is of course crazy all the injuries we have, today 12 injured players so now it is a little bit overdone, I think, but you see youngsters give always spirit to the team. I have a lot of experience with that and that is also a very important aspect of my philosophy.\"\n\nThat said, this sudden influx of acne and flattop haircuts into United's starting lineup was out of necessity rather than ingenuity. 12 first team players are out injured, plus Marcos Rojo went down during the game.\n\nOf the youngsters who did play on Sunday, Guillermo Varela was solid and grew into the game from right back, while Rashford stole the headlines up top and although it's difficult to class Memphis and Jesse Lingard as \"'youngins\" they're still under 23. That fact and with two midfielders Michael Carrick and Daley Blind playing center back emphasized how impressive of a patch-up job United did. For some reason, this song from a baby-faced Wiz Khalifa popped into my head as I watched the multiple academy products make their debut for United over the past few days. They're definitely on their grind, just like Wiz was back in the day.\n\n18-year-old Dutchman Tim Fosu-Mensah came off the bench to play most of the second half, while James Weir also made his first team debut late on in this huge game. The fact that none of these youngsters really looked out of place (well, Fosu-Mensah hardly look comfortable at left back with the midfielders usual attacking instincts kicking in, but he put in a great shift) playing against one of the best teams in the PL bodes well for the future. Sure, the adrenaline pumping may have improved their performance levels but this experience will hold them in good stead. A by-product of this injury crisis at United is that these youngsters will increase LVG's options, should he remain beyond the end of this season.\n\nWith United now just three points off the top four - crosstown rivals and fourth-placed Man City have a game in hand though - after this gritty win with a depleted team, maybe Van Gaal can salvage this season and get the fans back on his side.\n\nThis was a moment which could define Louis van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, with United leading 3-2 but Arsenal pushing hard for an equalizer, Van Gaal took exception to Alexis Sanchez going down after a tackle. The usually docile Dutchman jumped out of his seat and rushed out to the edge of the technical area to remonstrate with fourth official Mike Dean, the linesman and the refereeing crew.\n\n[ MORE: Van Gaal explains decision to flop ]\n\nThen, as the entire home support at United had noticed his outburst and began to roar him on in almost gladiatorial fashion, Van Gaal fell. He didn't trip. The Dutchman threw himself to the floor forcefully (but, impressively, still held onto his beloved clipboard) to demonstrate his disdain at what he perceived was simulation from Arsenal's players.\n\nThe fans loved it. \"Louis van Gaal's Red Army!\" was belted out by the Stretford End and it was a genuine \"what have I just seen?\" moment. Speaking to a can driver in Manchester after the game, he was laughing his head off and loving it. \"I don't like Van Gaal,\" the cabbie explained, \"but at least he got out of Fergie's seat and actually showed a bit of emotion for once instead of scribbling on his bloody clipboard!\"\n\nAfter the game, LVG rather sheepishly explained his decision to take a tumble.\n\n\"That was too emotional because at that time you a little bit too emotional because it is not good for the referee, the linesman, the fourth referee. I was emotional,\" Van Gaal said. \"It happens not too much. Normally I am sitting on my bench and I have a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench. I have apologised to the referee and the linesman. I have to control my emotions.\"\n\nWith constant reports linking Jose Mourinho to take over form Van Gaal this summer and many believing the United board set to release the Dutchman 12 months earlier than planned, that may still happen. Following the huge criticism for his \"boring tactics\" and many of the players he paid big money for not performing, he's still under severe pressure. But finally showing some emotion proved to United's fans that he has passion and something as simple as on overzealous demonstration of frustration could buy him some more time. At least until the end of the season.\n\nTWO HORSE TITLE RACE?\n\nWith Arsenal's defeat and Manchester City in League Cup final action, a golden opportunity for Leicester and Spurs to pull away present itself.\n\nBoth took advantage of it. Just.\n\nWe mentioned Leicester's last-gasp home win over Norwich and for much of the game they were second best as the Canaries had chances and limited the Foxes. However, just like all good title-winning teams do, they found a way of winning. Leicester still lead the way but are only two points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur we have a huge week on the horizon.\n\n[ MORE: Latest Premier League standings | Schedule ]\n\nSpurs have now won six-straight PL games as they battled back in the second half to overturn a 1-0 deficit to beat Swansea City 2-1 at White Hart Lane.

Add to that a north London derby against Arsenal on Saturday at the Lane and it's a huge week for Tottenham. They can not only boost their title hopes this week, they can also put a monumental dent in Arsenal's. The biggest NLD in PL history awaits, but first Spurs must take care of business at West Ham.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]\n\nThe fact that both Leicester and Tottenham is challenging for the title is remarkable. If either of them sees this out and wins the PL, it would be perhaps the most astonishing achievement in league history given the vast wealth and power the so-called \"big six\" possess. Of course, Leicester would be more incredible but the growing feeling is that Spurs are gathering steam and they are the bookmakers favorites to win the PL. If you uttered that sentence back in August, the stray jackets would've been on you quicker than you could say \"bob's your uncle.\"\n\nWILLY THE HERO FOR CITY\n\nWhile all of these title contenders were jostling, there was the small matter of a League Cup final taking place at Wembley Stadium between Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\nCity won 3-1 on penalty kicks, as Willy Caballero saved three of Liverpool's four spot kicks to be the hero and Yaya Toure rolled in the winner to send City's fans wild at Wembley.\n\nFernandinho had given City the lead courtesy of Simon Mignolet's howler but the Belgian goalkeeper did keep Liverpool in the game with some fine saves and Philippe Coutinho equalized seven minutes from time to force extra time.\n\nJurgen Klopp would've been bitterly disappointed to lose but it's hard to begrudge Manuel Pellegrini at least one trophy in his final season at City. His comments on playing with Caballero instead of recalling Joe Hart were also spot on. Pellegrini had promised Caballero he would play in every domestic cup game this season and despite the Argentine goalkeeper putting in a shaky display in the 5-1 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea last week, Pellegrini proved he's a man of his word.\n\n\"I would prefer to lose a title than lose my word,\" Pellegrini said. \"My word is more important than football. We deserved to win the game before penalties, but I'm happy to win it that way with Willy as a great hero.\"\n\nBrilliant. Here's the moment Yaya won it for City.\n\nAlso, check out this pre-game prediction from former Oasis front man Noel Gallagher.

Cameron had previously suffered an ankle injury which was healing slowly and he'd only had a few days of practice before being chucked back into the starting lineup by Mark Hughes with Stoke's other center backs out injured.\n\nTo mark the occasion, I caught up with Cameron at his house in Manchester as he kindly invited us in to chat all things PL, USMNT and more.\n\nClick play on the video below to see us throw around some banter, discuss Geoff's favorite flavor ice cream (seriously) and more.", "Jan Kirchhoff is one of the most important ingredients in Sunderland's attacking threat, believes Sam Allardyce.\n\nAs he was against Manchester City earlier in the month, Kirchhoff was Sunderland's stand-out figure in Saturday's defeat at West Ham United, with the German thriving in a holding midfield role.\n\nBut Allardyce says Kirchhoff's success has revolved around more than simply offering a 6ft 5in barrier in front of the Black Cats defence.\n\nThe accuracy of the ex-Bayern Munich man's passing, plus ability to deliver the ball forward at speed, has been hailed by Allardyce as a key factor for Sunderland on the attacking front.\n\n\"Jan's our most productive player in possession,\" said Allardyce.\n\n\"He delivered more balls than anybody else on Saturday, as he did against Manchester City.\n\n\"He gets the flow of our attacking forces going with the way he uses the ball and how good he is in terms of his vision of where to play the right ball forwards.\n\n\"Jan doesn't keep possession for possession's sake. He progresses us into more and more attacks by the way he uses the ball.\n\n\"He sees a pass probably better than anyone else at the club.\n\n\"It's important for him to be a part of this team in terms of what he gives us with our creativity.\"\n\nKirchhoff was struggling with cramp in the closing stages of the 1-0 loss at Upton Park, but is expected to keep his place for Sunderland's crunch clash against Crystal Palace.\n\nAllardyce has no fresh injury worries for the visit of Alan Pardew's side, with winger Jeremain Lens still not ready to return after a hernia operation.", "Paris - Goals were hard to come by for African players in the English Premier League, but Stephane Sessegnon was instrumental in West Brom's 3-2 win over Crystal Palace.\n\nIn Germany the prolific Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang found the net again for Borussia Dortmund, while in Spain Angolan international Manucho scored twice in six minutes for Rayo Vallecano in a 2-2 draw at Real Betis.\n\nSessegnon created what proved to be the decisive goal as West Brom overcame Crystal Palace 3-2. Following a neat build-up, the Benin midfielder floated a pass into the box from wide on the right and Burundi-born striker Saido Berahino met it with a flying left-foot volley to put West Brom 3-0 up in the 31st minute. Palace twice hit back through Connor Wickham, but the hosts held on for victory.\n\nBABA RAHMAN (Chelsea)\n\nGhanaian left-back Rahman endured an afternoon to forget in his side's 2-1 victory at Southampton. The 21-year-old inadvertently gifted Shane Long the opening goal by heading the ball straight into the Irishman's path and was taken off at half-time, before Chelsea hit back to win in the second half. \"I could say he was injured, but he was just taken off because of that (mistake),\" admitted Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink.\n\nRUDY GESTEDE (Aston Villa)\n\nBottom club Villa slipped closer to the Championship after a 2-1 defeat at Stoke City, but Gestede did at least claim an assist of sorts. The Benin striker, a 77th-minute replacement for Jordan Veretout, made a hash of gathering Aly Cissokho's left-wing cross, but with Stoke's defenders appealing for handball against him, Leandro Bacuna rolled the loose ball home.\n\nRIYAD MAHREZ (Leicester City)\n\nOne of the season's star men, Mahrez struggled to make inroads as Norwich City sat deep and invited the league leaders to attack them at the King Power Stadium. The Algerian winger produced some trademark jinks and dribbles, but it was left to substitute Leonardo Ulloa to net an 89th-minute winner in a hard-earned 1-0 victory.\n\nAngolan international Manucho scored twice in six minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute to rescue a 2-2 draw for Rayo Vallecano at Real Betis and stretch their unbeaten run to seven games.\n\nYOUSSEF EL ARABI (Granada)\n\nMoroccan forward El Arabi became Granada's all-time leading scorer in the Spanish top-flight with his 35th La Liga strike from the penalty spot to hand the Andalusians a vital 1-0 win at Deportivo la Coruna in their battle against relegation.\n\nThe Nigeria striker claimed his ninth league goal of the season to give Werder Bremen the opener in their 2-2 draw with Darmstadt before Claudio Pizarro rescued a point for the hosts with a 89th minutes header. Ujah slotted home on 33 minutes after some good work from Mali midfielder Sambou Yatabare before the 37-year-old Pizarro's header at the death rescued the hosts on Saturday.\n\nSALOMON KALOU (Hertha Berlin)\n\nThe Ivory Coast striker produced his first assist of the season as his pass led to Vedad Ibisevic's winner in a 1-0 victory at Cologne. Kalou, who has scored nine goals this season, spotted Ibisevic unmarked in the area to fire home just before halftime for his third goal this season against Cologne.\n\nPIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nThe Gabon striker netted second-placed Dortmund's final goal as they scored three in the final ten minutes to seal a fightback victory in a 3-1 win over ten-man Hoffenheim. In added time, Henrikh Mkhitaryan pulled the visitors goalkeeper off his line to give 'Auba' a simple tap in and claim his 22nd league goal of the season to leave him one behind top-scorer Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich.\n\nGuinea international Diallo scored Bastia's opening goal in a 2-0 victory at Nice. The 25-year-old curled home a superb free-kick on 61 minutes for his second goal of the season as the Corsican outfit recorded their third win in a row.\n\nMAJEED WARIS (Lorient)\n\nGhanaian striker Waris struck after just three minutes at Troyes to power Lorient to a 1-0 win against the league's bottom side. It was also the third goal in two matches for the 24-year-old, who upped his season's haul to seven.\n\nSalah has had sparkling form for Roma of late, but his run of good luck came to an abrupt end at the Carlo Castellani stadium on Saturday where the Egyptian was below his usual best. Thankfully for the Giallorossi, Stephan El Shaarawy - the Italy international who is half-Egyptian -- was on great form and hit his first brace for the club in a 3-1 win that sent Luciano Spalletti's men provisional third.", "It's happening again. It always happens. Why is it happening again?\n\n[ MORE: Three things learned ]\n\nThat's likely to be the question most Arsenal fans are asking themselves this morning and they have every right.\n\nAfter crashing to an injury-ravaged Manchester United 3-2 on Sunday at Old Trafford, Arsenal's title hopes are quite in ruins but it's getting there.\n\n[ MORE: Arsenal chokes ]\n\nFive points behind leaders Leicester with 11 games to go, the Gunners crumbled under the pressure. Leicester won on Saturday (Leonardo Ulloa's late winner saw the Foxes beat Norwich 1-0) to move five points clear. Arsenal knew they needed to win on Sunday and although they started the game brightly - Mesut Ozil's delicious flick set Nacho Monreal clean through but he shot right at David De Gea to squander a gilt-edged chance -- that urgency soon faded as defensive lapses left them crumpled in a heap.\n\n[ MORE: Player ratings ]\n\nLaurent Koscielny and Gabriel failed to pick up Marcus Rashford as Gabriel's poor clearance was picked up and then swept home by the teenager (much more on him, soon) and then he ghosted in-between the duo in the box to head home and put United 2-0 up in the first half. Defensively, Arsenal were shocking. Would Per Mertesacker's experience have helped? Probably not.\n\nThe Gunners showed some fight with Danny Welbeck scoring to make it 2-1 right on half time, but then they imploded again with poor midfield tracking and a lack of tenacity in the engine room the underlying issue in this defeat. Francis Coquelin left Ander Herrera with far too much time and space on the edge of the box and his deflected effort put United 3-1 up. Still, Mesut Ozil scored to make it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go and there was hope but Arsenal never truly looked like netting an equalizer on a day where star names didn't show up. Big time. Being present in Wenger's press conference after the game, it was clear he was annoyed with the performance. He snarled at suggestions stating that this defeat was his worst-ever to United because of their under-strength team and refused to criticize his senior players who didn't deliver.\n\n[ MORE: Wenger says title hopes still alive ]\n\nOzil had a goal and assist but did little apart from that. Alexis Sanchez struggled to have any influence on the game. Theo Walcott looked lost out wide. Even Petr Cech seemed to be struggling to demand his defense and organize them coherently.\n\nThat was the big issue here and in recent times, it's nothing new. Arsenal last won the title 10 years ago and this season clearly represents their best chance to end that drought. This was meant to be a new Arsenal, a side who could go away from home, sit back and defend then hit teams on the break. They've got better at it, but after putting themselves in a good position their customary end of season charge doesn't look like materializing once again this year. Coquelin and the lightweight, disappointing Aaron Ramsey went missing with Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera all over them to cut off the supply line to Arsenal's underperforming attacking midfield trio of Sanchez, Ozil and Walcott.\n\nWith Arsene Wenger's attacking team selection, he seemed to want to go for the jugular and rub salt in the wounds of a wounded, bitter long-term rival as United had several key players out. It backfired.\n\n\"I think they defended well. Every time we got in the flow they stopped us with little free kicks in the middle of the park,\" Wenger said. \"On set pieces I expected us to do more. We were not dangerous enough.\"\n\nIs Wenger the problem? Many had questioned his \"na\u00efve\" tactics and insistence on playing \"the right way\" over digging in and getting the job done. Those critics will find a fine voice once again after this damaging defeat. Coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's comeback win against Swansea, it is now Spurs who trail Leicester by two points and lead Arsenal by three. The Gunners face Swansea at home on Wednesday and then a huge north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nThis is it. Their title hopes will come down to the next two games. Can they pick themselves up and beat Swansea heading into the biggest derby matches against Spurs in PL history? They need to. Deep down, Wenger knows it.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Wenger said, with shrug. \"We dropped three important points and we have to show we can fight and bounce back on Wednesday night [against Swansea] and not feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nAlthough he hasn't given up on winning the title this season, he knows it's do or die in the next seven days. Arsenal's fans have seen this last chance saloon scenario play out too many times to be surprised. They're already starting to feel sorry for themselves.\n\nUNITED'S YOUNGINS\n\nThe eruption of noise at Old Trafford when Rashford lashed home a shot to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Arsenal on Sunday was unlike anything I've heard in recent times at OT. Perhaps it was the loudest since Sir Alex Ferguson retired...\n\n[ MORE: Rashford on his dream week ]\n\nScratch that. Rashford, 18, struck again in the first half and the noise was even louder. His two goals and assist led United to the win over Arsenal and the teenager, who only made his pro debut four days ago, now has four goals in his first two outings as a United player. Not bad.\n\nThe local lad seemed composed, unfazed and received glowing praise from both managers post-game. His movement was particularly impressive as he peeled away at key moments and didn't panic when two chances dropped his way. He did get lucky with a handball shout at the other end as he appeared to block the ball on the line with his arm, but the way his luck is going right now Craig Pawson missed it.\n\nRashford wasn't the only United youngin to make a scene. This week alone Van Gaal has handed debuts to five players from their academy and since he arrived at United just over 18 months ago he has handed 23 players their debut for the Red Devils. With eight academy products in United's 18-man squad on Sunday, their recently criticized academy does seem to be getting something right. He's always been an advocate of promoting youth players quickly and has had huge success doing it at Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"It is the culture of Manchester United and that is why they take me as a manager,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is of course crazy all the injuries we have, today 12 injured players so now it is a little bit overdone, I think, but you see youngsters give always spirit to the team. I have a lot of experience with that and that is also a very important aspect of my philosophy.\"\n\nThat said, this sudden influx of acne and flattop haircuts into United's starting lineup was out of necessity rather than ingenuity. 12 first team players are out injured, plus Marcos Rojo went down during the game.\n\nOf the youngsters who did play on Sunday, Guillermo Varela was solid and grew into the game from right back, while Rashford stole the headlines up top and although it's difficult to class Memphis and Jesse Lingard as \"'youngins\" they're still under 23. That fact and with two midfielders Michael Carrick and Daley Blind playing center back emphasized how impressive of a patch-up job United did. For some reason, this song from a baby-faced Wiz Khalifa popped into my head as I watched the multiple academy products make their debut for United over the past few days. They're definitely on their grind, just like Wiz was back in the day.\n\n18-year-old Dutchman Tim Fosu-Mensah came off the bench to play most of the second half, while James Weir also made his first team debut late on in this huge game. The fact that none of these youngsters really looked out of place (well, Fosu-Mensah hardly look comfortable at left back with the midfielders usual attacking instincts kicking in, but he put in a great shift) playing against one of the best teams in the PL bodes well for the future. Sure, the adrenaline pumping may have improved their performance levels but this experience will hold them in good stead. A by-product of this injury crisis at United is that these youngsters will increase LVG's options, should he remain beyond the end of this season.\n\nWith United now just three points off the top four - crosstown rivals and fourth-placed Man City have a game in hand though - after this gritty win with a depleted team, maybe Van Gaal can salvage this season and get the fans back on his side.\n\nThis was a moment which could define Louis van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, with United leading 3-2 but Arsenal pushing hard for an equalizer, Van Gaal took exception to Alexis Sanchez going down after a tackle. The usually docile Dutchman jumped out of his seat and rushed out to the edge of the technical area to remonstrate with fourth official Mike Dean, the linesman and the refereeing crew.\n\n[ MORE: Van Gaal explains decision to flop ]\n\nThen, as the entire home support at United had noticed his outburst and began to roar him on in almost gladiatorial fashion, Van Gaal fell. He didn't trip. The Dutchman threw himself to the floor forcefully (but, impressively, still held onto his beloved clipboard) to demonstrate his disdain at what he perceived was simulation from Arsenal's players.\n\nThe fans loved it. \"Louis van Gaal's Red Army!\" was belted out by the Stretford End and it was a genuine \"what have I just seen?\" moment. Speaking to a can driver in Manchester after the game, he was laughing his head off and loving it. \"I don't like Van Gaal,\" the cabbie explained, \"but at least he got out of Fergie's seat and actually showed a bit of emotion for once instead of scribbling on his bloody clipboard!\"\n\nAfter the game, LVG rather sheepishly explained his decision to take a tumble.\n\n\"That was too emotional because at that time you a little bit too emotional because it is not good for the referee, the linesman, the fourth referee. I was emotional,\" Van Gaal said. \"It happens not too much. Normally I am sitting on my bench and I have a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench. I have apologised to the referee and the linesman. I have to control my emotions.\"\n\nWith constant reports linking Jose Mourinho to take over form Van Gaal this summer and many believing the United board set to release the Dutchman 12 months earlier than planned, that may still happen. Following the huge criticism for his \"boring tactics\" and many of the players he paid big money for not performing, he's still under severe pressure. But finally showing some emotion proved to United's fans that he has passion and something as simple as on overzealous demonstration of frustration could buy him some more time. At least until the end of the season.\n\nTWO HORSE TITLE RACE?\n\nWith Arsenal's defeat and Manchester City in League Cup final action, a golden opportunity for Leicester and Spurs to pull away present itself.\n\nBoth took advantage of it. Just.\n\nWe mentioned Leicester's last-gasp home win over Norwich and for much of the game they were second best as the Canaries had chances and limited the Foxes. However, just like all good title-winning teams do, they found a way of winning. Leicester still lead the way but are only two points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur we have a huge week on the horizon.\n\n[ MORE: Latest Premier League standings | Schedule ]\n\nSpurs have now won six-straight PL games as they battled back in the second half to overturn a 1-0 deficit to beat Swansea City 2-1 at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino's team are rolling and they haven't won seven-straight league games since 1967. They have momentum and, compared to Leicester, have more offensive weapons and individually their players are better. It;s all been about the collective for Spurs and that's why they are where they are and boast the best defense in the PL.\n\nWith a trip to West Ham United on Wednesday (Watch live, 2:45 p.m. ET http://www.nbcsports.com/live-extraonline via Live Extra) the clash against their rivals and in-form Hammers will be a tough test. Add to that a north London derby against Arsenal on Saturday at the Lane and it's a huge week for Tottenham. They can not only boost their title hopes this week, they can also put a monumental dent in Arsenal's. The biggest NLD in PL history awaits, but first Spurs must take care of business at West Ham.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]\n\nThe fact that both Leicester and Tottenham is challenging for the title is remarkable. If either of them sees this out and wins the PL, it would be perhaps the most astonishing achievement in league history given the vast wealth and power the so-called \"big six\" possess. Of course, Leicester would be more incredible but the growing feeling is that Spurs are gathering steam and they are the bookmakers favorites to win the PL. If you uttered that sentence back in August, the stray jackets would've been on you quicker than you could say \"bob's your uncle.\"\n\nWILLY THE HERO FOR CITY\n\nWhile all of these title contenders were jostling, there was the small matter of a League Cup final taking place at Wembley Stadium between Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\nCity won 3-1 on penalty kicks, as Willy Caballero saved three of Liverpool's four spot kicks to be the hero and Yaya Toure rolled in the winner to send City's fans wild at Wembley.\n\nFernandinho had given City the lead courtesy of Simon Mignolet's howler but the Belgian goalkeeper did keep Liverpool in the game with some fine saves and Philippe Coutinho equalized seven minutes from time to force extra time.\n\nJurgen Klopp would've been bitterly disappointed to lose but it's hard to begrudge Manuel Pellegrini at least one trophy in his final season at City. His comments on playing with Caballero instead of recalling Joe Hart were also spot on. Pellegrini had promised Caballero he would play in every domestic cup game this season and despite the Argentine goalkeeper putting in a shaky display in the 5-1 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea last week, Pellegrini proved he's a man of his word.\n\n\"I would prefer to lose a title than lose my word,\" Pellegrini said. \"My word is more important than football. We deserved to win the game before penalties, but I'm happy to win it that way with Willy as a great hero.\"\n\nBrilliant. Here's the moment Yaya won it for City.\n\nAlso, check out this pre-game prediction from former Oasis front man Noel Gallagher.

There is also a distinct Dad's Army feel to the boardroom, where a naivety and belief that everything will be fine \"because we are Arsenal\" has resulted in the club being overtaken since 2004 by the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City, not to mention United.\n\nNobody seems to have a nasty streak at Arsenal, but somebody within the club's hierarchy needs to develop one, otherwise the annual sleepwalk to failure in the Premier League could be repeated on a far more damaging scale when the time comes to replace Wenger and recruit a new manager.\n\nCurrently, his contract is due to expire at the end of the 2016-17 season. The Frenchman, who celebrates his 20th anniversary in charge in September, may get a new deal to take him beyond next year, but if the Arsenal board were to sit with a blank sheet of paper this morning to devise a plan for life after Wenger, what would be the key points?\n\nHaving won just two FA Cups since 2004, do they go for a wholly new approach and target a Diego Simeone, a Roberto Mancini or even Wenger's nemesis, Jose Mourinho? Or do they stay loyal to Wenger's legacy and build on 20 years of continuity by hiring a manager in the same mould, who pursues football utopia on the pitch, but perhaps possesses the edge that the 66-year-old displayed when he arrived from Japan in September 1996 and started getting under Sir Alex Ferguson's skin?\n\nAll of the noises from the club suggest the latter, that Wenger's way is the Arsenal way and that there will be none of the turbulence and chaos that have engulfed United since Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nBut the classic image of Wenger (above), arms outstretched on the touchline as he questions a decision against his team, seems to be the most apt when picturing the reaction of the likes of chief executive Ivan Gazidis or majority shareholder Stan Kroenke to a question about \"what happens next?\"\n\nArsenal players react during the defeat at Old Trafford\n\nMany Arsenal supporters and former players believe that Wenger's time will be up this summer if he fails to end the club's 12-year wait for the title this season. With Chelsea imploding under Mourinho, United miles off the pace and City failing to play to their potential, Arsenal will never have a better opportunity to win the Premier League, but they sit five points adrift of the leaders Leicester City and three behind Tottenham, whom they face at White Hart Lane this Saturday.\n\nIt should be an open goal for Wenger and Arsenal but, in typical fashion, they are pussyfooting around rather than going for the throat.\n\nSo if the title goes elsewhere, will the board act decisively or will it allow Wenger to drift on for another year and let the indulgence of his purist philosophy just continue?\n\nWith cash reserves announced last week of \u00a3135.9m, a sparkling stadium, developing young team and the lure of London all strong cards in their hand, Arsenal should be able to attract any manager in the world to replace Wenger. But Gazidis and Kroenke have allowed Pep Guardiola to leave Bayern Munich for City, therefore ruling out the most obvious candidate to take the job.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, another good fit, was nailed down by Bayern in December, while Liverpool moved quickly last October to secure J\u00fcrgen Klopp.\n\nThere are no obvious successors who currently work at Arsenal being groomed by the club, but does two trophies in 12 years justify the continuation of the existing model anyway? Many would argue that it does not, but that is the problem with a club that believes its way is the best way and damn the rest.\n\nUnited allowed themselves to believe that they were a special case when Ferguson left, only to discover that they had not sufficiently planned ahead by lining up a Guardiola, Mourinho or Ancelotti as successor. So they ended up with David Moyes because he was the only available option and look how that turned out.\n\nArsenal could be heading in the same direction if they allow Wenger to dictate the terms of his departure and, if that happens, the lack of leaders in the boardroom will be infinitely more costly than the absence of them on the pitch at Old Trafford.\n\nFA's sane decision will only hurt self-importance of Uefa\n\nWell done to the Football Association for ignoring Uefa's restriction on televised domestic fixtures clashing with Champions League games by scheduling the FA Cup fifth-round replay between Hull City and Arsenal for next Tuesday.\n\nThe FA faces a fine for placing Hull v Arsenal against Wolfsburg v Gent and Real Madrid v Roma next Tuesday - albeit with an unusual 7pm kick-off - but will fans in Europe really be switching off Champions League games to watch events at the KC Stadium? Or is Uefa guilty of self-importance over its competition?\n\nIt's a fairly obvious answer.\n\n'Peter the keeper' seems to have been airbrushed out\n\nNext time you watch the opening credits for Match of the Day, keep an eye out for Peter Shilton.\n\nEngland's most capped international, a man who won a league title and two European Cups with Nottingham Forest and retired at the age of 47 after playing more than 1,000 league games, is nowhere to be seen among the black-and-white shots of former greats.\n\nSeems like an unusual omission.\n\nMore about: Arsenal Arsene Wenger", "Chelsea have convinced Ruben Loftus-Cheek to commit his future to the club by doubling his salary and making the midfielder a series of promises over first-team opportunities.\n\nAcademy graduate Loftus-Cheek has signed a new five-year contract that could see the 20-year-old earn upwards of \u00a360,000-a-week at Stamford Bridge.\n\nMore importantly for the youngster, however, was the fact that Chelsea have recommitted to helping him become a first-team regular with the promise of a proper chance to shine.\n\nRuben Loftus-Cheek can barely get a game at Chelsea\n\nChelsea chiefs had feared that Jose Mourinho's treatment of Loftus-Cheek would make it hard to negotiate a new deal with the player, but the club moved to his secure his future and fight off interest from Manchester City, United and Bayern Munich once the Portuguese was sacked.\n\nLoftus-Cheek had just over a year remaining on his previous \u00a332,000-a-week contract and has only started one game, the FA Cup victory over MK Dons, under interim manager Guus Hiddink. He scored his first goal for the club as a substitute against Scunthorpe United in the same competition.\n\nLoftus-Cheeks has been improving in recent weeks Photo: REX\n\nBut Chelsea remain convinced Loftus-Cheek will be an important first-team player and still believe he is an even better talent than Tottenham Hotspur's young star Dele Alli - despite the fact he has made just 13 first-team appearances to date.\n\nAlthough Antonio Conte is yet to be confirmed as Chelsea's next permanent manager, Loftus-Cheek has been assured by technical director Michael Emenalo that there is a plan in place to help his progression.\n\nHiddink has also claimed that Loftus-Cheek will get more first-team opportunities between now and the end of the season.\n\n\"In the upcoming match games there will be options as well,\" said Hiddink. \"I have him in mind to start of course.\n\n\"We have analysed him in training and the way he has to progress. He is working on that and it will pay off.\n\n\"He's a young guy. When I came here I thought he was 23-24, but he's 20.

It will pay off in the upcoming games. I don't give any guarantees, but he will have his minutes.\"\n\nOn signing his new deal, Loftus-Cheek said: \"The club have done so much for me since I started here as an under eight and now I want to repay the faith they have shown in me with my performances on the pitch.\"", "Former Bayern boss Uli Hoeness is a free man after having served half of his prison term for tax evasion. Now, German media are speculating about what future role he could take on at the country's most successful club.\n\nThe former Bayern president slipped quietly out of the detention facility in Rothenfeld, Bavaria early on Monday, after having served 637 days - exactly half of his three-and-a-half-year sentence for tax evasion. The fact that he was to be released on bail this Monday was public knowledge, but somehow the 64-year-old Hoeness managed to escape the attention of the waiting photographers.\n\nNow that Hoeness is out of prison, the German media are full of speculation about what role he might take on back at Bayern Munich. The only thing that appears to be clear is that he will return to the club in some position of leadership. \"It's not over,\" Hoeness promised the membership of FC Bayern at the club's annual general meeting in 2014, shortly before he began serving his sentence.\n\nThe speculation has also been fueled by a meeting Hoeness had at Bayern's headquarters last Monday, while he was on day release, involving the club's chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, its president, Karl Hopfner and Franz Beckenbauer, the honorary president. Immediately after that meeting, though, Rummenigge indicated that they had not discussed Hoeness' possible return to the boardroom. \"I still have spoken to him about his plans,\" Rummenigge said.\n\nVacation plans\n\nA week later, though, on the day of Hoeness' release, Beckenbauer seemed to indicate that the former president would return to the club in some capacity.\n\n\"First Uli should switch off and then get back in,\" Beckenbauer told the mass-circulation newspaper \"Bild,\" referring to Hoeness' plan to go on vacation with his family in June.\n\nNot just that, but the \"Sport Bild\" weekly cited an unnamed source whom it described as being part of Bayern's inner circle, who said that it was clear that Hoeness wanted to \"return to power.\"\n\nHoeness, who lost 18 kilograms (39 pounds) during his time in prison, has said that he won't make a decision on his future until some time the summer. Speaking in an interview published in last Thursday's edition of the German sports paper \"Kicker,\" the former Bayern boss said that until then, he plans to be just a \"normal\" supporter.\n\nThe former Bayern president, who was convicted in March 2014 of evading 28.5 million euros ($31 million) in tax, is reported to have long since repaid the German authorities, and also donated the money he earned working with one of Bayern's youth teams over the past 14 months.\n\nHis first public appearance is scheduled for March 13, when he is to deliver a speech at an event in honor of his good friend Jupp Heynkes, the coach who led Bayern to the treble in 2013.", "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted again as Borussia Dortmund scored three goals in the final 10 minutes for a dramatic 3-1 comeback win over 10-man TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on Sunday in the Bundesliga.\n\nHoffenheim captain Sebastian Rudy gave his side a deserved first-half lead in Dortmund before being sent off and the hosts were just 10 minutes from their first home defeat of the Bundesliga season.\n\nThe game turned when Rudy was shown a straight red card -- on his 26th birthday -- for bringing down Aubameyang, who was through on goal, on 58 minutes.\n\nWinger Henrikh Mkhitaryan spared Dortmund's blushes with an 80th-minute equalizer, before substitute Adrian Ramos headed a Lukasz Piszczek cross home on 85 minutes.\n\nMkhitaryan then laid on the third when he sprinted clear, drew Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and passed for Aubameyang to tap home in the second minute of stoppage-time.\n\nIt was the 22nd goal of the season for the Gabon striker, who is one behind the league's top scorer, Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski.\n\n\"We started very well, but then we lost our way,\" Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said.\n\n\"We invested a lot in the win, so it's a super nice and super important victory,\" he said.\n\nThe win saw second-placed Dortmund to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to eight points before Saturday's top-of-the-table clash against Pep Guardiola's Bavarians in Dortmund.\n\nHoffenheim remain second from bottom and four points from safety.\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth after a fightback earned a 2-2 draw at Augsburg.\n\nBrazilian striker Raffael had sent Moenchengladbach into a halftime lead before the game exploded into life with three goals in five second-half minutes.\n\nDespite their midweek UEFA Europa League exit at the hands of Liverpool, Augsburg, who are 13th, roared back with two goals in quick succession.\n\nIceland striker Alfred Finnbogason thumped a header home on 50 minutes, his first goal since joining from Olympiakos, before Brazilian winger Caiuby slotted neatly home just three minutes later.\n\nMoenchengladbach winger Fabian Johnson gave the perfect response when he smashed home his shot on 55 minutes to make it 2-2.\n\nThe visitors should have won when Oscar Wendt fired wide late on, while only a Marwin Hitz save denied Moenchengladbach captain Granit Xhaka.\n\nFSV Mainz 05 warmed up for tomorrow's league game at Bayern by going fifth with a 3-1 win at home to Bayer 04 Leverkusen, who had coach Roger Schmidt in the stands as he started a three-match ban.\n\nMainz's Yunus Malli and Jhon Cordoba netted first-half goals, then Malli netted a second-half penalty, before Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back.\n\nSchalke 04 dropped to seventh place after a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday night.", "It's happening again. It always happens. Why is it happening again?\n\n[ MORE: Three things learned ]\n\nThat's likely to be the question most Arsenal fans are asking themselves this morning and they have every right.\n\nAfter crashing to an injury-ravaged Manchester United 3-2 on Sunday at Old Trafford, Arsenal's title hopes are quite in ruins but it's getting there.\n\n[ MORE: Arsenal chokes ]\n\nFive points behind leaders Leicester with 11 games to go, the Gunners crumbled under the pressure. Leicester won on Saturday (Leonardo Ulloa's late winner saw the Foxes beat Norwich 1-0) to move five points clear. Arsenal knew they needed to win on Sunday and although they started the game brightly - Mesut Ozil's delicious flick set Nacho Monreal clean through but he shot right at David De Gea to squander a gilt-edged chance -- that urgency soon faded as defensive lapses left them crumpled in a heap.\n\n[ MORE: Player ratings ]\n\nLaurent Koscielny and Gabriel failed to pick up Marcus Rashford as Gabriel's poor clearance was picked up and then swept home by the teenager (much more on him, soon) and then he ghosted in-between the duo in the box to head home and put United 2-0 up in the first half. Defensively, Arsenal were shocking. Would Per Mertesacker's experience have helped? Probably not.\n\nThe Gunners showed some fight with Danny Welbeck scoring to make it 2-1 right on half time, but then they imploded again with poor midfield tracking and a lack of tenacity in the engine room the underlying issue in this defeat. Francis Coquelin left Ander Herrera with far too much time and space on the edge of the box and his deflected effort put United 3-1 up. Still, Mesut Ozil scored to make it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go and there was hope but Arsenal never truly looked like netting an equalizer on a day where star names didn't show up. Big time. Being present in Wenger's press conference after the game, it was clear he was annoyed with the performance. He snarled at suggestions stating that this defeat was his worst-ever to United because of their under-strength team and refused to criticize his senior players who didn't deliver.\n\n[ MORE: Wenger says title hopes still alive ]\n\nOzil had a goal and assist but did little apart from that. Alexis Sanchez struggled to have any influence on the game. Theo Walcott looked lost out wide. Even Petr Cech seemed to be struggling to demand his defense and organize them coherently.\n\nThat was the big issue here and in recent times, it's nothing new. Arsenal last won the title 10 years ago and this season clearly represents their best chance to end that drought. This was meant to be a new Arsenal, a side who could go away from home, sit back and defend then hit teams on the break. They've got better at it, but after putting themselves in a good position their customary end of season charge doesn't look like materializing once again this year. Coquelin and the lightweight, disappointing Aaron Ramsey went missing with Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera all over them to cut off the supply line to Arsenal's underperforming attacking midfield trio of Sanchez, Ozil and Walcott.\n\nWith Arsene Wenger's attacking team selection, he seemed to want to go for the jugular and rub salt in the wounds of a wounded, bitter long-term rival as United had several key players out. It backfired.\n\n\"I think they defended well. Every time we got in the flow they stopped us with little free kicks in the middle of the park,\" Wenger said. \"On set pieces I expected us to do more. We were not dangerous enough.\"\n\nIs Wenger the problem? Many had questioned his \"na\u00efve\" tactics and insistence on playing \"the right way\" over digging in and getting the job done. Those critics will find a fine voice once again after this damaging defeat. Coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's comeback win against Swansea, it is now Spurs who trail Leicester by two points and lead Arsenal by three. The Gunners face Swansea at home on Wednesday and then a huge north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nThis is it. Their title hopes will come down to the next two games. Can they pick themselves up and beat Swansea heading into the biggest derby matches against Spurs in PL history? They need to. Deep down, Wenger knows it.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Wenger said, with shrug. \"We dropped three important points and we have to show we can fight and bounce back on Wednesday night [against Swansea] and not feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nAlthough he hasn't given up on winning the title this season, he knows it's do or die in the next seven days. Arsenal's fans have seen this last chance saloon scenario play out too many times to be surprised. They're already starting to feel sorry for themselves.\n\nUNITED'S YOUNGINS\n\nThe eruption of noise at Old Trafford when Rashford lashed home a shot to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Arsenal on Sunday was unlike anything I've heard in recent times at OT. Perhaps it was the loudest since Sir Alex Ferguson retired...\n\n[ MORE: Rashford on his dream week ]\n\nScratch that. Rashford, 18, struck again in the first half and the noise was even louder. His two goals and assist led United to the win over Arsenal and the teenager, who only made his pro debut four days ago, now has four goals in his first two outings as a United player. Not bad.\n\nThe local lad seemed composed, unfazed and received glowing praise from both managers post-game. His movement was particularly impressive as he peeled away at key moments and didn't panic when two chances dropped his way. He did get lucky with a handball shout at the other end as he appeared to block the ball on the line with his arm, but the way his luck is going right now Craig Pawson missed it.\n\nRashford wasn't the only United youngin to make a scene. This week alone Van Gaal has handed debuts to five players from their academy and since he arrived at United just over 18 months ago he has handed 23 players their debut for the Red Devils. With eight academy products in United's 18-man squad on Sunday, their recently criticized academy does seem to be getting something right. He's always been an advocate of promoting youth players quickly and has had huge success doing it at Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"It is the culture of Manchester United and that is why they take me as a manager,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is of course crazy all the injuries we have, today 12 injured players so now it is a little bit overdone, I think, but you see youngsters give always spirit to the team. I have a lot of experience with that and that is also a very important aspect of my philosophy.\"\n\nThat said, this sudden influx of acne and flattop haircuts into United's starting lineup was out of necessity rather than ingenuity. 12 first team players are out injured, plus Marcos Rojo went down during the game.\n\nOf the youngsters who did play on Sunday, Guillermo Varela was solid and grew into the game from right back, while Rashford stole the headlines up top and although it's difficult to class Memphis and Jesse Lingard as \"'youngins\" they're still under 23. That fact and with two midfielders Michael Carrick and Daley Blind playing center back emphasized how impressive of a patch-up job United did. For some reason, this song from a baby-faced Wiz Khalifa popped into my head as I watched the multiple academy products make their debut for United over the past few days. They're definitely on their grind, just like Wiz was back in the day.\n\n18-year-old Dutchman Tim Fosu-Mensah came off the bench to play most of the second half, while James Weir also made his first team debut late on in this huge game. The fact that none of these youngsters really looked out of place (well, Fosu-Mensah hardly look comfortable at left back with the midfielders usual attacking instincts kicking in, but he put in a great shift) playing against one of the best teams in the PL bodes well for the future. Sure, the adrenaline pumping may have improved their performance levels but this experience will hold them in good stead. A by-product of this injury crisis at United is that these youngsters will increase LVG's options, should he remain beyond the end of this season.\n\nWith United now just three points off the top four - crosstown rivals and fourth-placed Man City have a game in hand though - after this gritty win with a depleted team, maybe Van Gaal can salvage this season and get the fans back on his side.\n\nThis was a moment which could define Louis van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, with United leading 3-2 but Arsenal pushing hard for an equalizer, Van Gaal took exception to Alexis Sanchez going down after a tackle. The usually docile Dutchman jumped out of his seat and rushed out to the edge of the technical area to remonstrate with fourth official Mike Dean, the linesman and the refereeing crew.\n\n[ MORE: Van Gaal explains decision to flop ]\n\nThen, as the entire home support at United had noticed his outburst and began to roar him on in almost gladiatorial fashion, Van Gaal fell. He didn't trip. The Dutchman threw himself to the floor forcefully (but, impressively, still held onto his beloved clipboard) to demonstrate his disdain at what he perceived was simulation from Arsenal's players.\n\nThe fans loved it. \"Louis van Gaal's Red Army!\" was belted out by the Stretford End and it was a genuine \"what have I just seen?\" moment. Speaking to a can driver in Manchester after the game, he was laughing his head off and loving it. \"I don't like Van Gaal,\" the cabbie explained, \"but at least he got out of Fergie's seat and actually showed a bit of emotion for once instead of scribbling on his bloody clipboard!\"\n\nAfter the game, LVG rather sheepishly explained his decision to take a tumble.\n\n\"That was too emotional because at that time you a little bit too emotional because it is not good for the referee, the linesman, the fourth referee. I was emotional,\" Van Gaal said. \"It happens not too much. Normally I am sitting on my bench and I have a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench. I have apologised to the referee and the linesman. I have to control my emotions.\"\n\nWith constant reports linking Jose Mourinho to take over form Van Gaal this summer and many believing the United board set to release the Dutchman 12 months earlier than planned, that may still happen. Following the huge criticism for his \"boring tactics\" and many of the players he paid big money for not performing, he's still under severe pressure. But finally showing some emotion proved to United's fans that he has passion and something as simple as on overzealous demonstration of frustration could buy him some more time. At least until the end of the season.\n\nTWO HORSE TITLE RACE?\n\nWith Arsenal's defeat and Manchester City in League Cup final action, a golden opportunity for Leicester and Spurs to pull away present itself.\n\nBoth took advantage of it. Just.\n\nWe mentioned Leicester's last-gasp home win over Norwich and for much of the game they were second best as the Canaries had chances and limited the Foxes. However, just like all good title-winning teams do, they found a way of winning. Leicester still lead the way but are only two points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur we have a huge week on the horizon.\n\n[ MORE: Latest Premier League standings | Schedule ]\n\nSpurs have now won six-straight PL games as they battled back in the second half to overturn a 1-0 deficit to beat Swansea City 2-1 at White Hart Lane.

The biggest NLD in PL history awaits, but first Spurs must take care of business at West Ham.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]\n\nThe fact that both Leicester and Tottenham is challenging for the title is remarkable. If either of them sees this out and wins the PL, it would be perhaps the most astonishing achievement in league history given the vast wealth and power the so-called \"big six\" possess. Of course, Leicester would be more incredible but the growing feeling is that Spurs are gathering steam and they are the bookmakers favorites to win the PL. If you uttered that sentence back in August, the stray jackets would've been on you quicker than you could say \"bob's your uncle.\"\n\nWILLY THE HERO FOR CITY\n\nWhile all of these title contenders were jostling, there was the small matter of a League Cup final taking place at Wembley Stadium between Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\nCity won 3-1 on penalty kicks, as Willy Caballero saved three of Liverpool's four spot kicks to be the hero and Yaya Toure rolled in the winner to send City's fans wild at Wembley.\n\nFernandinho had given City the lead courtesy of Simon Mignolet's howler but the Belgian goalkeeper did keep Liverpool in the game with some fine saves and Philippe Coutinho equalized seven minutes from time to force extra time.\n\nJurgen Klopp would've been bitterly disappointed to lose but it's hard to begrudge Manuel Pellegrini at least one trophy in his final season at City. His comments on playing with Caballero instead of recalling Joe Hart were also spot on. Pellegrini had promised Caballero he would play in every domestic cup game this season and despite the Argentine goalkeeper putting in a shaky display in the 5-1 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea last week, Pellegrini proved he's a man of his word.\n\n\"I would prefer to lose a title than lose my word,\" Pellegrini said. \"My word is more important than football. We deserved to win the game before penalties, but I'm happy to win it that way with Willy as a great hero.\"\n\nBrilliant.

two chances to break the deadlock on the stroke of half-time, Paul Pogba's delivery across goal finding no takers and then Mandzukic narrowly missing the Frenchman's inviting through ball that forced Handanovic out to parry.\n\nThe first half fizzled out, but the second started with a bang when, after just two minues, Bonucci broke the deadlock.\n\nDybala floated in a free-kick from the right that was met by D'Ambrosio, whose header towards the back post provided the perfect assist for Bonucci to smash into the roof of the net.\n\n\"Bonucci scored a great goal, it wasn't easy,\" added Allegri.\n\nJuve almost doubled their lead minutes later, Dybala's first-timer from Sandro's cross on the left trickling past the right post.\n\nJuve's fans were up in arms when Juan Jesus chopped Dybala down from behind, and it was similar indiscipline that led to Juve's second six minutes from time.\n\nMorata appeared to irk Miranda as they tussled for possession on the edge of the box, the

The eight-nation US-based tournament was also notable for the group-stage exit of Mexico, while Costa Rica reached the semi-finals to continue their impressive form from the FIFA Women's World Cup Canada 2015\u2122.

Perhaps the most notable league to recommence was Germany's, home to the reigning European club champions 1.FFC Frankfurt - a traditional powerhouse in women's football. However, it is Bayern Munich who are on looking to build a new hegemony, with the Bavarians now on track for a second successive title thanks to a ten-point lead over Frankfurt just past the midway point of the season.\n\nMelbourne City set new standard\n\nThe final day of last month saw fresh benchmarks set in Australia as new W-League club Melbourne City won the championship in their maiden season. And they did so in style winning all 14 matches, albeit one was on penalties. Buoyed by star recruits Kim Little and Jess Fishlock, as well as a host of local internationals, City wrapped up the title with a classy 4-1 win over Sydney FC in the championship decider.\n\nDevelopment\n\nAhead of a massive month for development across the globe, February's activities were highlighted by the visit of two richly experienced former international coaches to nations that are eager to further build upon their foundations in women's football. Former England manager Hope Powell visited Namibia where up to three dozen coaches participated in a FIFA Women's Coaching Course in Windhoek. The Namibia FA has put significant resources into the women's game off the field over recent years, while on the field they hosted the 2014 CAF African Women's Championship, securing a famous win against Zambia in the process. Meanwhile in Belize, the expertise offered by Mexican Andrea Rodebaugh was similarly valued as the nation's next generation of female coaches undertook an intense five-day coaching workshop.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the globe's most impressive female match officials were named to participate in this week's annual Algarve Cup. Eighteen referees and assistant referees from various parts of the globe were selected for the prestigious tournament, which is also part of the preparation for the prospective candidate referees and assistant referees for the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup Jordan 2016 and the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Papua New Guinea 2016.\n\nThe stat\n\n100 - USA defender Becky Sauerbrunn made her 100th international appearance, remarkably becoming the 35th Stars and Stripes player to do so.\n\nThe quote\n\n\"It is one of the toughest tournaments that any of us will ever go through.

The reason? He loves his former club and derby rivals Manchester United too much.\n\nPique had moved to United in 2004 when he was still a teenager and played under Sir Alex Ferguson for four seasons, mainly in the reserves. He was sparingly used in the senior team, having made only 23 appearances in all competitions.\n\n\"When I was 17 or 18 at Manchester United, I didn't play often and it really affected me,\" Pique said. \"I didn't understand why I couldn't play more minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before Guardiola took over at Barcelona and made the defender a priority signing. Pique eventually moved back to his boyhood club after they paid the Red Devils \u00a35m to sign him.\n\nSince then, he has been part of one of the most successful sides in the history of football, winning trophies at the Camp Nou under many managers. With Guardiola alone he won 14 trophies, including two Champions League titles in the 2008/09 and 2010/11 seasons.\n\n\"In the good times, when I arrived at Barcelona at 21, I won every trophy - the treble, six cups, and thought I was a superstar. But, with time, you realise you have bad times like everyone else and you need to get up.\"\n\nGuardiola announced at the start of the month that he was set to leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season and take over from Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City. Since the announcement, a number of his former players have been linked with a move to City, most notably players from the Catalan club.\n\nManchester United are my second club: Pique\n\nWhen he was asked whether he would make the switch to the Etihad to play under Guardiola again, Pique said a reunion at City was impossible.\n\n\"My love for Manchester United is too great for me to sign for City,\" Pique said. \"Even though Pep is a great coach.\n\n\"I'm very happy in Barcelona. United are my second club, but my future is at Barca. I'm very proud to play at Barcelona. I think it's the best club in the world.\n\nHaving made close to 400 appearances for Barcelona, Pique also said he was open to playing in a different league before he retired. He also hinted at a possible move to Colombia - the country where his wife and singer Shakira was born.\n\n\"I would like to try a different league when I've got a few years to go before retiring,\" he explained. \"I don't know if it will be Colombia, I'd like that for Shakira, but nobody can predict the future.\"", "The 18-year-old marked his Premier League debut with two goals in three minutes as United beat Arsenal 3-2.\n\nRashford also scored twice on his first-team debut against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League on Thursday, according to BBC.\n\nVan Gaal said, \"Youngsters often play well in the first match. The second is different. Marcus played well in both so he is a special talent.\"\n\nThe former Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich boss said Rashford's debut compared favorably with those by some of football's biggest stars, namely Patrick Kluivert, Xavi and Thomas Muller.\n\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger was also impressed by the youngster.\n\nHe said he was surprised by Rashford's \"movement and his intelligence\", adding, \"He could be a very positive surprise for Manchester United.\"\n\nHaving scored four goals in his first two senior games, Rashford used the word 'crazy' to describe his introduction to United's first team.\n\n\"This is my first game in the Premier League, so obviously it's been amazing,\" he told Sky Sports. \"To score two has been a bonus, so hopefully we can carry it on and go again the next game.\n\n\"It was a shock playing midweek as well. But that maybe benefited me because I wasn't thinking about the game too much. It's just crazy.\"\n\nNo, according to David Horrocks, the player development officer at his former youth club, Fletcher Moss Rangers.\n\n\"He won't like it at all,\" Horrocks told BBC Radio 5 live. \"He's a very shy boy. His family will have been having nightmares at the press parked outside his house after Thursday night. They won't have liked it at all.\n\n\"He's a very unassuming lad. After the match yesterday, as he was coming off, his head was down, facing the floor. He just doesn't like the adulation.\n\n\"It'll possibly come to him in the future, but, at the moment, it's not his bag.\"", "The games keep coming thick and fast for treble-seeking Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga league-leaders host Mainz on Wednesday. Expect Pep Guardiola to wave the \"rotation\" wand in midweek against their fifth-placed opponents, especially as Bayern travel to Borussia Dortmund for a top-of-the-table clash next Saturday.\n\nAll the recent talk has centred on Bayern's central defensive problems with Holger Badstuber, Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng all missing through injury. But, as we witnessed with another clean sheet in Wolfsburg at the weekend, these major cracks in defence can easily be papered over, at least in the Bundesliga. Makeshift central defenders Joshua Kimmich and David Alaba continue to fill the void with aplomb.\n\nThat said, an injury to either Manuel Neuer or Robert Lewandowski would be an entirely different proposition and could potentially be very destructive to Bayern's hopes of silverware, particularly in Europe. Neuer and Lewandowski are simply irreplaceable.\n\nGuardiola waxed lyrical about Franck Ribery's performance at the weekend -- \"Ribery was crucial with his quality in one-on-ones.\" After impressing once again as a substitute, the effervescent 32-year-old Frenchman may be rewarded with a first start of the year in front of his adoring Munich faithful. Ribery could replace Brazilian Douglas Costa, who is still searching for his 2015 form after the winter break.\n\nWhile Ribery has caught the eye coming off the bench in three straight games, Mario Gotze was an unused sub in each and every one. Guardiola's pledge that \"perhaps Gotze will play 90 minutes\" proved empty as he once again languished on the bench against Wolfsburg. Rest assured, given his lack of progress under Guardiola, Gotze is one player that won't be accompanying the Catalan to Manchester City. However, Gotze will be chomping at the bit to end his latest spell of bench-warming against Mainz.\n\nInjury-prone Moroccan Medhi Benatia, another unused substitute at the weekend, urgently needs some game time with the Champions League return leg against Juventus looming. However, the more games Kimmich and Alaba line up together in central defence, the more likely it is that Guardiola will give them the nod to start against the Serie A giants. Serdar Tasci, on loan from Spartak Moscow, looks set to remain a 53-minute central defensive experiment after bungling his recent audition against Darmstadt.\n\nThe weekend game itself had some positives. Bayern celebrated their 116th birthday in fine style with a 2-0 win in Wolfsburg at the weekend to retain their cosy eight-point advantage over Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, French winger Kingsley Coman broke the deadlock on 66 minutes, stabbing home a crucial opener. After finding the scoresheet for the first time since November, 19-year-old Coman became the first Bayern teenager to score four Bundesliga goals since Bastian Schweinsteiger back in 2003-04. If Coman can look back in 15 years on anything remotely near the stellar career that \"Schweini\" has enjoyed, the youngster will have done very well.\n\nUnlike last week's game at Juve, a 2-0 lead against Wolfsburg proved to be secure though the Bavarians had Manuel Neuer to thank for keeping the hungry \"Wolves\" at bay. Germany's No. 1 was absolutely impenetrable on his 150th appearance for the club, sealing his 84th clean sheet with a string of fine stops to deny international teammates Max Kruse and Julian Draxler.\n\nDisappointingly, there were none of the \"five goals in nine minutes\" heroics from Robert Lewandowski this time around but the Polish striker did grab an obligatory goal, his sixth of the season in the league against Wolfsburg, doubling the lead with an instinctive flick into the corner of the net to seal the points. The Bundesliga's top scorer (23 goals) has now notched 33 in 34 matches for Bayern in all competitions this season.\n\nBayern have still only dropped just seven points all season and remain eight clear of nearest challengers BVB, who they meet in a mouth-watering clash next Saturday. It can't be a title decider as we haven't actually had a race, but Bayern will be looking to go into the modern-day Klassiker with their current lead intact. Should they then avoid defeat in Dortmund, a historic fourth title on the trot seems a mere formality.\n\nBut first up, Bayern host Mainz 05 in \"English Week.\" As befits their name, the visitors are currently riding high in fifth spot but trail Bayern by some 26 points after only 23 games. Bayern will bank on their home form this season with 11 consecutive Bundesliga wins at Fortress Allianz Arena. Anything other than a routine victory would be a major surprise.", "It's happening again. It always happens. Why is it happening again?\n\n[ MORE: Three things learned ]\n\nThat's likely to be the question most Arsenal fans are asking themselves this morning and they have every right.\n\nAfter crashing to an injury-ravaged Manchester United 3-2 on Sunday at Old Trafford, Arsenal's title hopes are quite in ruins but it's getting there.\n\n[ MORE: Arsenal chokes ]\n\nFive points behind leaders Leicester with 11 games to go, the Gunners crumbled under the pressure. Leicester won on Saturday (Leonardo Ulloa's late winner saw the Foxes beat Norwich 1-0) to move five points clear. Arsenal knew they needed to win on Sunday and although they started the game brightly - Mesut Ozil's delicious flick set Nacho Monreal clean through but he shot right at David De Gea to squander a gilt-edged chance -- that urgency soon faded as defensive lapses left them crumpled in a heap.\n\n[ MORE: Player ratings ]\n\nLaurent Koscielny and Gabriel failed to pick up Marcus Rashford as Gabriel's poor clearance was picked up and then swept home by the teenager (much more on him, soon) and then he ghosted in-between the duo in the box to head home and put United 2-0 up in the first half. Defensively, Arsenal were shocking. Would Per Mertesacker's experience have helped? Probably not.\n\nThe Gunners showed some fight with Danny Welbeck scoring to make it 2-1 right on half time, but then they imploded again with poor midfield tracking and a lack of tenacity in the engine room the underlying issue in this defeat. Francis Coquelin left Ander Herrera with far too much time and space on the edge of the box and his deflected effort put United 3-1 up. Still, Mesut Ozil scored to make it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go and there was hope but Arsenal never truly looked like netting an equalizer on a day where star names didn't show up. Big time. Being present in Wenger's press conference after the game, it was clear he was annoyed with the performance. He snarled at suggestions stating that this defeat was his worst-ever to United because of their under-strength team and refused to criticize his senior players who didn't deliver.\n\n[ MORE: Wenger says title hopes still alive ]\n\nOzil had a goal and assist but did little apart from that. Alexis Sanchez struggled to have any influence on the game. Theo Walcott looked lost out wide. Even Petr Cech seemed to be struggling to demand his defense and organize them coherently.\n\nThat was the big issue here and in recent times, it's nothing new. Arsenal last won the title 10 years ago and this season clearly represents their best chance to end that drought. This was meant to be a new Arsenal, a side who could go away from home, sit back and defend then hit teams on the break. They've got better at it, but after putting themselves in a good position their customary end of season charge doesn't look like materializing once again this year. Coquelin and the lightweight, disappointing Aaron Ramsey went missing with Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera all over them to cut off the supply line to Arsenal's underperforming attacking midfield trio of Sanchez, Ozil and Walcott.\n\nWith Arsene Wenger's attacking team selection, he seemed to want to go for the jugular and rub salt in the wounds of a wounded, bitter long-term rival as United had several key players out. It backfired.\n\n\"I think they defended well. Every time we got in the flow they stopped us with little free kicks in the middle of the park,\" Wenger said. \"On set pieces I expected us to do more. We were not dangerous enough.\"\n\nIs Wenger the problem? Many had questioned his \"na\u00efve\" tactics and insistence on playing \"the right way\" over digging in and getting the job done. Those critics will find a fine voice once again after this damaging defeat. Coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's comeback win against Swansea, it is now Spurs who trail Leicester by two points and lead Arsenal by three. The Gunners face Swansea at home on Wednesday and then a huge north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nThis is it. Their title hopes will come down to the next two games. Can they pick themselves up and beat Swansea heading into the biggest derby matches against Spurs in PL history? They need to. Deep down, Wenger knows it.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Wenger said, with shrug. \"We dropped three important points and we have to show we can fight and bounce back on Wednesday night [against Swansea] and not feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nAlthough he hasn't given up on winning the title this season, he knows it's do or die in the next seven days. Arsenal's fans have seen this last chance saloon scenario play out too many times to be surprised. They're already starting to feel sorry for themselves.\n\nUNITED'S YOUNGINS\n\nThe eruption of noise at Old Trafford when Rashford lashed home a shot to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Arsenal on Sunday was unlike anything I've heard in recent times at OT. Perhaps it was the loudest since Sir Alex Ferguson retired...\n\n[ MORE: Rashford on his dream week ]\n\nScratch that. Rashford, 18, struck again in the first half and the noise was even louder. His two goals and assist led United to the win over Arsenal and the teenager, who only made his pro debut four days ago, now has four goals in his first two outings as a United player. Not bad.\n\nThe local lad seemed composed, unfazed and received glowing praise from both managers post-game. His movement was particularly impressive as he peeled away at key moments and didn't panic when two chances dropped his way. He did get lucky with a handball shout at the other end as he appeared to block the ball on the line with his arm, but the way his luck is going right now Craig Pawson missed it.\n\nRashford wasn't the only United youngin to make a scene. This week alone Van Gaal has handed debuts to five players from their academy and since he arrived at United just over 18 months ago he has handed 23 players their debut for the Red Devils. With eight academy products in United's 18-man squad on Sunday, their recently criticized academy does seem to be getting something right. He's always been an advocate of promoting youth players quickly and has had huge success doing it at Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"It is the culture of Manchester United and that is why they take me as a manager,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is of course crazy all the injuries we have, today 12 injured players so now it is a little bit overdone, I think, but you see youngsters give always spirit to the team. I have a lot of experience with that and that is also a very important aspect of my philosophy.\"\n\nThat said, this sudden influx of acne and flattop haircuts into United's starting lineup was out of necessity rather than ingenuity. 12 first team players are out injured, plus Marcos Rojo went down during the game.\n\nOf the youngsters who did play on Sunday, Guillermo Varela was solid and grew into the game from right back, while Rashford stole the headlines up top and although it's difficult to class Memphis and Jesse Lingard as \"'youngins\" they're still under 23. That fact and with two midfielders Michael Carrick and Daley Blind playing center back emphasized how impressive of a patch-up job United did. For some reason, this sound from a baby-faced Wiz Khalifa popped into my head as I watched the multiple academy products make their debut for United over the past few days. They're definitely on their grind, just like Wiz was back in the day.\n\n18-year-old Dutchman Tim Fosu-Mensah came off the bench to play most of the second half, while James Weir also made his first team debut late on in this huge game. The fact that none of these youngsters really looked out of place (well, Fosu-Mensah hardly look comfortable at left back with the midfielders usual attacking instincts kicking in, but he put in a great shift) playing against one of the best teams in the PL bodes well for the future. Sure, the adrenaline pumping may have improved their performance levels but this experience will hold them in good stead. A by-product of this injury crisis at United is that these youngsters will increase LVG's options, should he remain beyond the end of this season.\n\nWith United now just three points off the top four - crosstown rivals and fourth-placed Man City have a game in hand though - after this gritty win with a depleted team, maybe Van Gaal can salvage this season and get the fans back on his side.\n\nThis was a moment which could define Louis van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, with United leading 3-2 but Arsenal pushing hard for an equalizer, Van Gaal took exception to Alexis Sanchez going down after a tackle. The usually docile Dutchman jumped out of his seat and rushed out to the edge of the technical area to remonstrate with fourth official Mike Dean, the linesman and the refereeing crew.\n\n[ MORE: Van Gaal explains decision to flop ]\n\nThen, as the entire home support at United had noticed his outburst and began to roar him on in almost gladiatorial fashion, Van Gaal fell. He didn't trip. The Dutchman threw himself to the floor forcefully (but, impressively, still held onto his beloved clipboard) to demonstrate his disdain at what he perceived was simulation from Arsenal's players.\n\nThe fans loved it. \"Louis van Gaal's Red Army!\" was belted out by the Stretford End and it was a genuine \"what have I just seen?\" moment. Speaking to a can driver in Manchester after the game, he was laughing his head off and loving it. \"I don't like Van Gaal,\" the cabbie explained, \"but at least he got out of Fergie's seat and actually showed a bit of emotion for once instead of scribbling on his bloody clipboard!\"\n\nAfter the game, LVG rather sheepishly explained his decision to take a tumble.\n\n\"That was too emotional because at that time you a little bit too emotional because it is not good for the referee, the linesman, the fourth referee. I was emotional,\" Van Gaal said. \"It happens not too much. Normally I am sitting on my bench and I have a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench. I have apologised to the referee and the linesman. I have to control my emotions.\"\n\nWith constant reports linking Jose Mourinho to take over form Van Gaal this summer and many believing the United board set to release the Dutchman 12 months earlier than planned, that may still happen. Following the huge criticism for his \"boring tactics\" and many of the players he paid big money for not performing, he's still under severe pressure. But finally showing some emotion proved to United's fans that he has passion and something as simple as on overzealous demonstration of frustration could buy him some more time. At least until the end of the season.\n\nTWO HORSE TITLE RACE?\n\nWith Arsenal's defeat and Manchester City in League Cup final action, a golden opportunity for Leicester and Spurs to pull away present itself.\n\nBoth took advantage of it. Just.\n\nWe mentioned Leicester's last-gasp home win over Norwich and for much of the game they were second best as the Canaries had chances and limited the Foxes. However, just like all good title-winning teams do, they found a way of winning. Leicester still lead the way but are only two points ahead of Tottenham Hotspur we have a huge week on the horizon.\n\n[ MORE: Latest Premier League standings | Schedule ]\n\nSpurs have now won six-straight PL games as they battled back in the second half to overturn a 1-0 deficit to beat Swansea City 2-1 at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino's team are rolling and they haven't won seven-straight league games since 1967. They have momentum and, compared to Leicester, have more offensive weapons and individually their players are better. It;s all been about the collective for Spurs and that's why they are where they are and boast the best defense in the PL.\n\nWith a trip to West Ham United on Wednesday (Watch live, 2:45 p.m. ET http://www.nbcsports.com/live-extraonline via Live Extra) the clash against their rivals and in-form Hammers will be a tough test. Add to that a north London derby against Arsenal on Saturday at the Lane and it's a huge week for Tottenham. They can not only boost their title hopes this week, they can also put a monumental dent in Arsenal's. The biggest NLD in PL history awaits, but first Spurs must take care of business at West Ham.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]\n\nThe fact that both Leicester and Tottenham is challenging for the title is remarkable. If either of them sees this out and wins the PL, it would be perhaps the most astonishing achievement in league history given the vast wealth and power the so-called \"big six\" possess. Of course, Leicester would be more incredible but the growing feeling is that Spurs are gathering steam and they are the bookmakers favorites to win the PL. If you uttered that sentence back in August, the stray jackets would've been on you quicker than you could say \"bob's your uncle.\"\n\nWILLY THE HERO FOR CITY\n\nWhile all of these title contenders were jostling, there was the small matter of a League Cup final taking place at Wembley Stadium between Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\nCity won 3-1 on penalty kicks, as Willy Caballero saved three of Liverpool's four spot kicks to be the hero and Yaya Toure rolled in the winner to send City's fans wild at Wembley.\n\nFernandinho had given City the lead courtesy of Simon Mignolet's howler but the Belgian goalkeeper did keep Liverpool in the game with some fine saves and Philippe Coutinho equalized seven minutes from time to force extra time.\n\nJurgen Klopp would've been bitterly disappointed to lose but it's hard to begrudge Manuel Pellegrini at least one trophy in his final season at City. His comments on playing with Caballero instead of recalling Joe Hart were also spot on. Pellegrini had promised Caballero he would play in every domestic cup game this season and despite the Argentine goalkeeper putting in a shaky display in the 5-1 FA Cup defeat at Chelsea last week, Pellegrini proved he's a man of his word.\n\n\"I would prefer to lose a title than lose my word,\" Pellegrini said. \"My word is more important than football. We deserved to win the game before penalties, but I'm happy to win it that way with Willy as a great hero.\"\n\nBrilliant. Here's the moment Yaya won it for City.\n\nAlso, check out this pre-game prediction from former Oasis front man Noel Gallagher. Doesn't get any more accurate than this.\n\nGeoff Cameron RETURNS\n\nFinally, it's great to see a U.S. national team player back fit and firing in the Premier League.\n\nGeoff Cameron returned from nearly two months out on Saturday to star at the heart of Stoke City's defense as the Potters beat Aston Villa 2-1. Cameron had previously suffered an ankle injury which was healing slowly and he'd only had a few days of practice before being chucked back into the starting lineup by Mark Hughes with Stoke's other center backs out injured.\n\nTo mark the occasion, I caught up with Cameron at his house in Manchester as he kindly invited us in to chat all things PL, USMNT and more.\n\nClick play on the video below to see us throw around some banter, discuss Geoff's favorite flavor ice cream (seriously) and more.", "It's happening again. It always happens. Why is it happening again?\n\n[ MORE: Three things learned ]\n\nThat's likely to be the question most Arsenal fans are asking themselves this morning and they have every right.\n\nAfter crashing to an injury-ravaged Manchester United 3-2 on Sunday at Old Trafford, Arsenal's title hopes are quite in ruins but it's getting there.\n\n[ MORE: Arsenal chokes ]\n\nFive points behind leaders Leicester with 11 games to go, the Gunners crumbled under the pressure. Leicester won on Saturday (Leonardo Ulloa's late winner saw the Foxes beat Norwich 1-0) to move five points clear. Arsenal knew they needed to win on Sunday and although they started the game brightly - Mesut Ozil's delicious flick set Nacho Monreal clean through but he shot right at David De Gea to squander a gilt-edged chance -- that urgency soon faded as defensive lapses left them crumpled in a heap.\n\n[ MORE: Player ratings ]\n\nLaurent Koscielny and Gabriel failed to pick up Marcus Rashford as Gabriel's poor clearance was picked up and then swept home by the teenager (much more on him, soon) and then he ghosted in-between the duo in the box to head home and put United 2-0 up in the first half. Defensively, Arsenal were shocking. Would Per Mertesacker's experience have helped? Probably not.\n\nThe Gunners showed some fight with Danny Welbeck scoring to make it 2-1 right on half time, but then they imploded again with poor midfield tracking and a lack of tenacity in the engine room the underlying issue in this defeat. Francis Coquelin left Ander Herrera with far too much time and space on the edge of the box and his deflected effort put United 3-1 up. Still, Mesut Ozil scored to make it 3-2 with 20 minutes to go and there was hope but Arsenal never truly looked like netting an equalizer on a day where star names didn't show up. Big time. Being present in Wenger's press conference after the game, it was clear he was annoyed with the performance. He snarled at suggestions stating that this defeat was his worst-ever to United because of their under-strength team and refused to criticize his senior players who didn't deliver.\n\n[ MORE: Wenger says title hopes still alive ]\n\nOzil had a goal and assist but did little apart from that. Alexis Sanchez struggled to have any influence on the game. Theo Walcott looked lost out wide. Even Petr Cech seemed to be struggling to demand his defense and organize them coherently.\n\nThat was the big issue here and in recent times, it's nothing new. Arsenal last won the title 10 years ago and this season clearly represents their best chance to end that drought. This was meant to be a new Arsenal, a side who could go away from home, sit back and defend then hit teams on the break. They've got better at it, but after putting themselves in a good position their customary end of season charge doesn't look like materializing once again this year. Coquelin and the lightweight, disappointing Aaron Ramsey went missing with Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera all over them to cut off the supply line to Arsenal's underperforming attacking midfield trio of Sanchez, Ozil and Walcott.\n\nWith Arsene Wenger's attacking team selection, he seemed to want to go for the jugular and rub salt in the wounds of a wounded, bitter long-term rival as United had several key players out. It backfired.\n\n\"I think they defended well. Every time we got in the flow they stopped us with little free kicks in the middle of the park,\" Wenger said. \"On set pieces I expected us to do more. We were not dangerous enough.\"\n\nIs Wenger the problem? Many had questioned his \"na\u00efve\" tactics and insistence on playing \"the right way\" over digging in and getting the job done. Those critics will find a fine voice once again after this damaging defeat. Coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's comeback win against Swansea, it is now Spurs who trail Leicester by two points and lead Arsenal by three. The Gunners face Swansea at home on Wednesday and then a huge north London derby at Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nThis is it. Their title hopes will come down to the next two games. Can they pick themselves up and beat Swansea heading into the biggest derby matches against Spurs in PL history? They need to. Deep down, Wenger knows it.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" Wenger said, with shrug. \"We dropped three important points and we have to show we can fight and bounce back on Wednesday night [against Swansea] and not feel sorry for ourselves.\"\n\nAlthough he hasn't given up on winning the title this season, he knows it's do or die in the next seven days. Arsenal's fans have seen this last chance saloon scenario play out too many times to be surprised. They're already starting to feel sorry for themselves.\n\nUNITED'S YOUNGINS\n\nThe eruption of noise at Old Trafford when Rashford lashed home a shot to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Arsenal on Sunday was unlike anything I've heard in recent times at OT. Perhaps it was the loudest since Sir Alex Ferguson retired...\n\n[ MORE: Rashford on his dream week ]\n\nScratch that. Rashford, 18, struck again in the first half and the noise was even louder. His two goals and assist led United to the win over Arsenal and the teenager, who only made his pro debut four days ago, now has four goals in his first two outings as a United player. Not bad.\n\nThe local lad seemed composed, unfazed and received glowing praise from both managers post-game. His movement was particularly impressive as he peeled away at key moments and didn't panic when two chances dropped his way. He did get lucky with a handball shout at the other end as he appeared to block the ball on the line with his arm, but the way his luck is going right now Craig Pawson missed it.\n\nRashford wasn't the only United youngin to make a scene. This week alone Van Gaal has handed debuts to five players from their academy and since he arrived at United just over 18 months ago he has handed 23 players their debut for the Red Devils. With eight academy products in United's 18-man squad on Sunday, their recently criticized academy does seem to be getting something right. He's always been an advocate of promoting youth players quickly and has had huge success doing it at Ajax and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"It is the culture of Manchester United and that is why they take me as a manager,\" Van Gaal said. \"It is of course crazy all the injuries we have, today 12 injured players so now it is a little bit overdone, I think, but you see youngsters give always spirit to the team. I have a lot of experience with that and that is also a very important aspect of my philosophy.\"\n\nThat said, this sudden influx of acne and flattop haircuts into United's starting lineup was out of necessity rather than ingenuity. 12 first team players are out injured, plus Marcos Rojo went down during the game.\n\nOf the youngsters who did play on Sunday, Guillermo Varela was solid and grew into the game from right back, while Rashford stole the headlines up top and although it's difficult to class Memphis and Jesse Lingard as \"'youngins\" they're still under 23. That fact and with two midfielders Michael Carrick and Daley Blind playing center back emphasized how impressive of a patch-up job United did. For some reason, this sound from a baby-faced Wiz Khalifa popped into my head as I watched the multiple academy products make their debut for United over the past few days. They're definitely on their grind, just like Wiz was back in the day.\n\n18-year-old Dutchman Tim Fosu-Mensah came off the bench to play most of the second half, while James Weir also made his first team debut late on in this huge game. The fact that none of these youngsters really looked out of place (well, Fosu-Mensah hardly look comfortable at left back with the midfielders usual attacking instincts kicking in, but he put in a great shift) playing against one of the best teams in the PL bodes well for the future. Sure, the adrenaline pumping may have improved their performance levels but this experience will hold them in good stead. A by-product of this injury crisis at United is that these youngsters will increase LVG's options, should he remain beyond the end of this season.\n\nWith United now just three points off the top four - crosstown rivals and fourth-placed Man City have a game in hand though - after this gritty win with a depleted team, maybe Van Gaal can salvage this season and get the fans back on his side.\n\nThis was a moment which could define Louis van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, with United leading 3-2 but Arsenal pushing hard for an equalizer, Van Gaal took exception to Alexis Sanchez going down after a tackle. The usually docile Dutchman jumped out of his seat and rushed out to the edge of the technical area to remonstrate with fourth official Mike Dean, the linesman and the refereeing crew.\n\n[ MORE: Van Gaal explains decision to flop ]\n\nThen, as the entire home support at United had noticed his outburst and began to roar him on in almost gladiatorial fashion, Van Gaal fell. He didn't trip. The Dutchman threw himself to the floor forcefully (but, impressively, still held onto his beloved clipboard) to demonstrate his disdain at what he perceived was simulation from Arsenal's players.\n\nThe fans loved it. \"Louis van Gaal's Red Army!\" was belted out by the Stretford End and it was a genuine \"what have I just seen?\" moment. Speaking to a can driver in Manchester after the game, he was laughing his head off and loving it. \"I don't like Van Gaal,\" the cabbie explained, \"but at least he got out of Fergie's seat and actually showed a bit of emotion for once instead of scribbling on his bloody clipboard!\"\n\nAfter the game, LVG rather sheepishly explained his decision to take a tumble.\n\n\"That was too emotional because at that time you a little bit too emotional because it is not good for the referee, the linesman, the fourth referee. I was emotional,\" Van Gaal said. \"It happens not too much. Normally I am sitting on my bench and I have a lot of criticism because I am sitting on my bench. I have apologised to the referee and the linesman. I have to control my emotions.\"\n\nWith constant reports linking Jose Mourinho to take over form Van Gaal this summer and many believing the United board set to release the Dutchman 12 months earlier than planned, that may still happen. Following the huge criticism for his \"boring tactics\" and many of the players he paid big money for not performing, he's still under severe pressure. But finally showing some emotion proved to United's fans that he has passion and something as simple as on overzealous demonstration of frustration could buy him some more time.

We start out at one level and then we want to continuously increase it. As we get new models, et cetera, then we may source more things. But we also have to find a global balance. We are building a car of a cluster and the cluster is sourced globally.\"\n\nFjording said Volvo should start letting supplier contracts this spring.\n\nThe plant is initially scheduled to make 65,000 S60 sedans a year, with the first one rolling off the assembly line sometime in the fall of 2018.\n\nAlso at the automotive summit Friday, an industry forecaster said U.S. auto companies should be able to manage through any sales downturn that could result if the nation slips into recession in the next few years.\n\nJeffery Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for LMC Automotive of Troy, Michigan, predicted U.S. light vehicle sales would hit 17.8 million this year, another record.\n\nBut they could drop to 16 million in 2019 if a recession hits, he said.\n\nWhile that would be a loss, auto companies should find it \"manageable,\" Schuster said.\n\nNearly 500 people registered for the three-day auto summit, which the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance has hosted in Greenville every year for five years.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://grnol.co/210rqCB", "UPDATE: Upon further consideration, and after speaking to some industry insiders, it appears this might not actually be a new Cadillac, but instead just a mule of the new Chevy Traverse. One source points out that the foglights are fixed, round units, which would be production spec and would not suggest Cadillac. Another source says the Cadillac version of the Traverse/Acadia/Enclave was cancelled, and development has stopped. Yes, a Cadillac of this size is expected to arrive - and elements of this prototype sure do look Cadillac to us - but it might be too early for this to be it.\n\nCadillac is expanding its portfolio with a three-row crossover. This is it. Expected to be called the XT7, the new vehicle will give Cadillac an entry above the XT5 and below the hulking Escalade.\n\nThough the XT7 is heavily covered, we can see Cadillac's bold grille and what looks like strong proportions. It'll probably look like a larger XT5, and you can sort of see a similar roofline if you squint. Spy shooters caught it testing with the new Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave, and they're all expected to use the new General Motors 3.6-liter V6 engine, like the recently revealed GMC Acadia.\n\nThe XT7 could show up as soon as late this year or early in 2017. Its part of GM's push to capitalize on the red-hot crossover segment that has been fueled by low gas prices and Americans' thirst for utility. The XT7 would likely represent GM's most profitable play in this segment. Simply affixing the Cadillac badge on the front adds thousands of dollars to the sticker compared to a Chevy or Buick product.\n\nThe XT7 will also give Cadillac a significant opportunity for growth - and perhaps allow it to gain on Mercedes and BMW on the sales charts. While the CTS and ATS have had mixed success, Americans have continued to show a willingness to buy Cadillac utility vehicles. The XT7 is the latest in Cadillac's product blitz following the XT5 and the CT6 range-topping sedan. Those two are the most critical Caddys, but the XT7 isn't far off.\n\nRelated Video:", "<iframe width=\"476\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://abc7.com/video/embed/?pid=1220585\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> A car buyer was scammed out of $9,000 after responding to a Craigslist ad. Now, he is speaking out exclusively to Eyewitness News as police search for more victims.\n\nThe victim, who wished to remain anonymous, found a Craigslist ad for a used Audi S5 for $9,000.\n\nAfter doing research and texting with the seller, the two met at the Santa Ana Auto Mall.\n\n\"He said that it was owned by BMW and that it was on consignment at Audi, so we would have to meet at BMW, which was right next door,\" he said.\n\nPolice said Audi did have the car for sale - but for nearly $39,000. Police believe the suspect duplicated the information and lowered the price.\n\nAt the seller's request, the victim test drove the vehicle then met him with cash. After handing the seller the cash, the two walked to the BMW showroom.\n\n\"We had a seat and he had a seat and then he said, 'Let me grab something,' and around the corner he went,\" he described.\n\nThe victim did catch the seller's license plate. That led police to arrest 25-year-old Michael Garduno. Detectives have already identified two other victims and believe there are more.\n\n\"This is what this guy does on a daily basis. They believe he's concentrating on the counties of Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside,\" said Cpl.

As for the victim, he's relieved officers caught Garduno.\n\n\"It's a learning lesson. I've learned from it. Doesn't scare me to be on Craigslist, it just teaches me to be more aware,\" he said.\n\nIf you believe you may have been a victim, you're asked to call Santa Ana police at (714) 245-8362.", "A new generation of electric cars is coming, whether we like it or not. Some experts are claiming that by 2050, only about 10 percent of ...\n\nA new generation of electric cars is coming, whether we like it or not. Some experts are claiming that by 2050, only about 10 percent of all vehicles on the road will be powered solely by internal combustion engines. Hybrids and EVs are becoming the future of the automotive world and it's happening rather quickly. So BMW must be ready and it's doing so by investing heavily into an electric future.\n\nWe've already seen the new concepts from BMW of what the future holds and that's just the beginning. BMW is working very hard to implement electric and hybrid technology into almost every single model line possible and it must do so to survive. Reason being is that BMW isn't the only German car company that's doing this, as both the entire Volkswagen Group and Mercedes-Benz are working hard on this new generation of EVs as well.\n\nSo to make sure that it's ready for the next generation of electric cars, BMW has several new projects in the works for the future. This year, BMW will be adding an upgraded battery to its i3 hatchback, a 330e plug-in hybrid variant of its famous 3 Series will be debuting and so will a 740e plug-in hybrid variant of its flagship vehicle. After that, the i3 will be due for its LCI treatment in 2018, the BMW i8 will also receive a refresh in 2019 and then BMW's i Division should be debuting something new in 2020, such as the BMW i5/iX. BMW will then continue to develop new electric and hybrid vehicles and technologies.\n\nTo keep the ball moving, BMW will be developing a new electric car platform, called FSAR (which stands for Flat battery Storage Assembly) and will be closely associated with BMW's new CLAR architecture and the two would be able to be built alongside each other. This will help with cost and development, as cars built on both architectures would share technology and materials.\n\nBut BMW does need to get a move on if it wants to stay ahead of the pack. BMW's Bavarian neighbor, Audi, is also working on some new BEV vehicles, with the upcoming e-tron Quattro coming out in 2018 and Q7 e-tron TDI. Porsche is also creating its monstrously powerful Mission E electric vehicle, which should be the king of high-end EV performance cars. Mercedes-Benz is also working on its new ELC (an electrified variant of the GLC crossover) and the ELC (and electric variant of the GLA). So there's quite the electrical arms race going on in Germany.\n\nAs the infrastructure for electric cars gets bigger and better, making it much more convenient and practical for people to own EVs, this race for superior EV technology is only going to increase. With restrictions getting tighter and governments getting more and more involved, automakers are going to be forced to create new and improved means of electric mobility and quickly. So BMW is doing everything it can to prepare for this next generation of electric vehicles. We'll soon find out if it's enough. [Source:", "Yesterday, we provided you with a list of cars that were tested last year by the EuroNCAP and were nominated the safest of 2015. Out of over 40 models tested by the EuroNCAP in 2015, only eight vehicles managed to get on this list.\n\nWe also promised to deliver an equivalent list for vehicles sold in the US market, where two organization conduct safety testing for new cars, IIHS and NHTSA.\n\nUnlike the list that reviews vehicles marketed in Europe and the largest safety organization of this continent, the IIHS and NHTSA have different safety criteria and grading scales.\n\nInstead of issuing a list of the safest vehicles in a segment, the IIHS makes a \"Top Safety Pick\" list. Then they introduced the \"Top Safety Pick +\" category, which clarifies the situation, as it only features models with the best ratings in all five crashworthiness tests, and that feature an advanced or superior rating for front crash prevention.\n\nSince the list of vehicles that got the Top Safety Pick Plus distinction is pretty long, we'll cut the presentation of each vehicle to the minimum so you will have an easy read ahead.\n\nWe have taken the freedom of dividing them into classes by relative size and body style, by simplifying the IIHS's system and merging premium cars with volume models.\n\nWe're only writing about 2016 model year vehicles in this story and only the ones with the Top Safety Pick Plus designation will be presented below. Another relevant note is that most of the models listed achieved the TSP+ distinction with optional front crash prevention systems.\n\nOur list will feature small cars, mid-size cars, full-size cars, and an assortment of SUVs. The latter was split into small, midsize, and full-size as well.\n\nSmall Cars and Compact Cars\n\nThe smallest car to receive the IIHS Top Safety Pick + distinction is the 2016 Scion iA, which is a US version of the Mazda2 Sedan. The other models on this list are larger, and they include models like the Acura ILX compact sedan. The list also includes the Honda Civic compact sedan, built by the same corporation. The only hybrid compact segment car to make the Top Safety Pick + list in its category is the Lexus CT200h hatchback.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mazda3 compact sedan and hatchback is nominated for this award with both body styles. The Subaru range has three models, all on the Impreza platform. Therefore, the Crosstrek compact crossover, Impreza, and the Subaru WRX all get the Top Safety Pick + distinction.\n\nSimilar things happen with the Volkswagen offering, as the Golf receives this award in three versions: the 4-door hatchback, SportWagen, and its GTI version. Audi's A3 Sedan is also on this list, along with BMW's 2 Series Coupe.\n\nMidsize Cars\n\nThe list of midsize cars is naturally composed of both premium and volume models, and only the versions with front crash prevention protection were eligible for the Top Safety Pick Plus distinction. We begin our list of this category with Lexus's ES 350 sedan, built on a Toyota platform. Volvo's S60 and V60 platform brothers also share a TSP+ distinction.\n\nThis title is not limited to import cars, like the Chrysler 200 shows. Honda made a substantial presence with its Accord two-door Coupe and four-door sedan. However, Honda is not the only manufacturer with Two models on this list in the midsize class, as Nissan proves with its Maxima and Altima sedans, as well as Volkswagen does with its Jetta and Passat sedans.\n\nSubaru achieves the same feat with its Legacy and Outback models, as does Toyota with its Camry and Prius V. The Mazda6 midsize sedan completes our list along with its Sonata rival from Hyundai.\n\nFull-size Cars\n\nThe list of full-size cars with the Top Safety Pick + distinction only features a volume model, the Toyota Avalon. Meanwhile, Acura's RLX sedan is listed with the luxury manufacturers, just like the Hyundai Genesis Sedan is. They battle it out with Audi's A6 and Infiniti's Q70. The latter only gets the TSP+ distinction without the V8 four-wheel-drive models.\n\nJapanese carmakers are well represented in this class, with a presence from the recently launched Lexus RC Coupe. The recently replaced Mercedes-Benz E-Class is still on the TSP+ list, as is Volvo's S80 sedan.\n\nSmall and Compact SUVs\n\nThe first bundle of SUVs to be included in our selection is formed by the smallest of them. According to the IIHS, only the Fiat 500X models built after July 2015 get their esteemed Top Safety Pick + status. The rating is applied to Honda's compact SUV offering, the CR-V. Hyundai does not lag behind and gets the same rating for its Tucson. Mazda can also pride itself with a TSP+ rating for their compact SUV, the CX-5.\n\nMitsubishi gets the same score for their compact-class SUV, the Outlander. Subaru's Forester and Toyota's RAV4 complete the list of SUVs with the best safety rating awarded by the IIHS for the 2016 Model Year.\n\nMidsize SUVs\n\nThe list of midsize SUVs that received the IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus distinction is pretty long, so let's get on with it. The Honda Motor Corporation has three models with this distinction, but only one sold under its main brand, the 2016 Honda Pilot. Meanwhile, the Acura brand, also owned by Honda, has two midsize SUVs with the TSP+ award, the MDX, and RDX, and both belong in the same class.\n\nAudi is the only German carmaker with a model in this category with the TSP+ distinction, the Q5. Nissan also has one model in this group with the award, the Murano SUV, as does Toyota, with its Highlander.\n\nLexus prides itself with two models in the midsize segment that received the best assessment from the IIHS, the NX, and RX. The Lexus NX and RX are the only SUVs in this class that also come in hybrid versions and have achieved this distinction.\n\nThe other brand with two SUVs with the Top Safety Pick + distinction in this segment is Volvo, which reached this feat with the XC60 and XC90 models. Both have excellent active and passive safety features.\n\nThe only full-size SUV awarded with the IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus distinction is the Audi Q7.\n\nPlay Video", "With crossovers/SUVs becoming ever more dominant in the automotive landscape, it was only a matter of time until they became more capable on- and off-road.

With our unparalleled level of service and unique selection of ultra-luxury vehicles on offer, we are confident that this success will continue in 2016, as such impressive results will keep driving us forward to maintain our position as one of The Kingdom's most revered luxury brands.\"\n\nSales for the Ghost Series II - the pinnacle business limousine - continued to surge throughout 2015 with a 75% increase, proving itself to be a firm favorite among discerning customers. Considered an oasis of calm in a busy connected world, the Rolls-Royce Ghost Series II exudes effortless superiority and peerless driving dynamics, providing an engaging and effortless driving experience.\n\nThe ongoing success of the Ghost Series II, Phantom family and Wraith models, including the limited edition Bespoke Collection cars - Wraith Inspired by Film, Fashion & Music, and Phantom Limelight - also further cemented Rolls-Royce's position as the world's pre-eminent creator of truly individual motor cars, and the most popular ultra-luxury automotive brand in KSA.\n\nIn September last year, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars stunned the market by revealing its latest model - Dawn - the world's only four-seater super-luxury drophead, which was received well by Saudi clientele. The launch of this new benchmark in open-top luxury motoring, has primed Mohamed Yousuf Naghi Motors for a strong start to the year, further strengthening its presence in the region and on the marque's global network. -- SG", "On the Mercedes-Benz production line, robots are danger of losing their jobs -- to people. It turns out robots can't always handle the complexity of some tasks and they take longer to reprogram for a new model. People are more adaptable, even if they sometimes call in sick on Monday and consider the first day of hunting season to be a national holiday. At the Mercedes-Benz factory in Sindelfing, Germany, workers are being brought in to replace robots at production jobs where there are an increasing number of parts options.\n\nRobots are best are repeating the same task over and over, such are lifting a heavy piece of stamped metal and welding it to another piece, setting it in the finished parts bin, and lifting and welding another piece. They've also pretty much replaced humans in hazardous parts of the factory, such as the spray paint booths (below). They lay down the same amount of paint in the same overlapping pattern each time, and they're unaffected by the fumes, even if it's water-based paint now.\n\nWhen you buy a mainstream car, complexity is reduced via bundling of options into just a handful of sometimes-quirky packages, such as lifesaving adaptive cruise control plus a panoramic sunroof and leather seat trim. At the same, the luxury automakers of Germany -- Audi, BMW, and Mercedes -- have tripled the models they offer since 1990 and they've added more options, many of which can be ordered in a package or standalone. The robots can't handle it, or more correctly, the programming that makes the robot pick up the correct radio tuning knob -- rubber-covered versus metal versus ceramic, for instance -- is overwhelming.\n\nMarkus Schaefer, the Mercedes-Benz head of production, told BloombergBusiness, \"Robots can't deal with the degree of individualization and the many variants that we have today. We're saving money and safeguarding our future by employing more people.\"\n\nMercedes says that for tasks involving skilled works, the company can shift a production line to a new model over the weekend. Reprogramming robots would take longer and idle the factory.\n\nSometimes a worker will be paired with a machine helper, and sometimes smaller devices will replace the bulkier robots. Mercedes gives the example of the head-up display going into the new E-Class due this spring, which needs to be aligned. What two robots used to do, the task will now be handle by a worker or a smaller, movable sensor device.\n\nAt the same time, Mercedes says it has a goal of cutting the hours spent assembling a Benz from 60 hours currently to 30 hours. That's going to require simplified assembly methods, or savvier workers, or smarter robots -- or perhaps some of each.", "FMCG, automobile industries say if GST regime kicks in, rail hubs can take Make in India to a new high As Railway Budget 2016 promised focus on freight corridors and Railway Board Chairman A K Mittal revealed the strategy to tap sectors like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and automobiles to increase traffic, the success of the ambitious plan hinges on the goods and services (GST) tax regime.\n\nIf freight corridors become reality as promised, FMCG sector could cut down expenses and streamline operations. The inventory-heavy industry, in which logistical efficiency and warehousing play a significant role, will be able to shift towards centralised production at cheaper rates.\n\nRead our full coverage on Union Budget 2016\n\nCurrently, Indian Railways transport only 1,000 million tonnes of FMCG products every year. While a few majors such as Nestle and milk co-operatives use the railways for supply of raw materials and dispatching finished goods from the factories, a majority of the players depend heavily on road transport.\n\n\"We are open to considering railways as the preferred mode of transporting goods, provided that is economically viable,\" said Lalit Malik, chief financial officer, Dabur India.\n\nAccording to top executive of a milk co-operative, while the industry uses railways to ferry milk, for items such as ice creams and foods, it is not viable. \"We have a set infrastructure for that. Also, railway freights are higher than the road,\" he said.\n\nWhile most FMCG companies have welcomed the initiative, various state-level taxes are a major hindrance in transporting goods from one part of the country to another by train. To avoid multiple state-level taxes, most FMCG entities are forced to set up manufacturing units and warehouses near every major market. For example, Coca-Cola India has 57 production units while PepsiCo has 41 units.\n\nAccording to a Coca-Cola India official, transporting glass bottles through railways could be a game changer since it will help beverage makers reduce the number of bottling units in the long term.\n\n\"If GST is implemented, the companies may not need to set up sales depots in every state as is the requirement now,\" said Harsh Mariwala, chairman, Marico.\n\n\"Typically, primary freight is used by most companies including us to transport raw materials such as palm oil from ports to factories. For secondary freight (using railways) is a challenge since delivery of finished goods in FMCG tends to be door-to-door,\" said Sunil Kataria, business head, India & SAARC, Godrej Consumer Products. \"Rail transport can become viable if manufacturing and distribution centres are fewer, so goods can travel large distances resulting in economies of scale.\"\n\nBig opportunity in auto transport\n\nAutomakers, especially those in the South, are expecting a 10-15 per cent reduction in transportation cost if the planned rail-auto hub in Chennai becomes a reality. Apart from cost savings, railway is safer and cheaper mode for transporting heavy auto parts or vehicles.\n\nR C Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki said \"There are advantages in terms of safety to the vehicle. Damages can be avoided. Obviously, it is not an economically unviable proposition.\" Maruti Suzuki has been using rail as a mode to transport vehicles for last few years through dedicated rakes and other wagons.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Railway Ministry has made a push to attract automobile companies. A policy formulated during the UPA regime allowed automobile firms to lease the trains for transporting vehicles with help from logistic companies. The plan, however, wasn't very successful.\n\nThe proposed rail-auto hub will serve Hyundai, Nissan-Renault, Ford, BMW and Daimler which are based near Chennai. \"This will bring significant efficiencies and reduction in logistic costs for many automobile OEMs in and around the Chennai region, including us,\" said Sumit Sawhney, chief executive and managing director, Renault India.\n\nIndian Railways uses specially designed wagons to transport vehicles. At present, railways transports only about two-three per cent of new vehicles. The government is also encouraging vehicle transport by ship. Recently, Hyundai shipped cars from Chennai to Kandla in Gujarat.\n\nFrequent agitations, leading to blocking of highways, freight rate increase, strike by truck drivers and accidents leading to financial loss are some of the inherent risks of transporting vehicles by road.\n\n\"The rail auto hub in Chennai would help southern auto OEMs improve their logistical, multi-modal efficiencies significantly. It will encourage transportation of cars through railways, thereby offering greener logistical solutions through decongestion of road traffic,\" a Ford India spokesperson said.\n\nPravin Shah, president and chief executive (automotive), Mahindra & Mahindra said, \"This is a very welcome step. These are the enablers for achieving the kind of growth the auto industry is looking for. But we just have to see how quickly these are put into place.\"", "Monterey California, USA -- Those of us who are old enough to remember the film, Top Gun -- the blockbuster that put a young Tom Cruise on course to super stardom -- will recall that this was about a flight academy for elite fighter pilots. In some ways, the BMW's M sub-brand is something of a Top Gun programme for the Bavarian manufacturer as well.\n\nAlthough BMW is known for building some of the most performance-oriented cars in their respective classes, M takes this ideal to its most extreme.\n\nNotable luminaries include the M3 and M5, cars that have evolved into performance machines capable of taking on more expensive rivals like Porsche's 911 and Mercedes' AMG range.\n\nCars like the M4 (known as the M3 coupe under BMW's previous naming system) have become so powerful that today, superhuman driving abilities are needed to get anywhere near this car's limits.\n\nFor those who want a less intimidating M car, the recently launched M2 may be just the ticket.\n\nFor starters, it is based on the BMW 2 Series, which is a smaller car than the 4 Series-based M4. Besides a more intimate cabin that tends to make the driver feel more connected to the car, occupying less space on the road also means that there's more room to pick your chosen line through a corner for more fluid transitions when changing direction.\n\nUp until now, the sportiest 2 Series was the M235i but the M2 now takes the range to the next level with an even more extensively-fettled 3-litre turbocharged version of the N55 engine. In this state, it produces 370hp and 465Nm of torque, which can be boosted to 500Nm of torque in short bursts, thanks to an overboost function.", "Audi is the top brand in Consumer Reports' annual rankings despite the fact that its diesels cheated on U.S. emissions tests.\n\nSubaru, Lexus, Porsche and BMW rounded out the top five in the survey.\n\nVolkswagen AG -- which owns the Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen brands -- has admitted it installed software that allowed vehicles to cheat on emissions tests as far back as the 2009 model year.

According to our friends at AUTOMOBILE, German automakers are investing billions in developing next-generation battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as a way to meet new emissions regulations even though a well-integrated charging infrastructure is still far from reality, range anxiety remains an issue, and electric car sales have stayed flat.\n\nIn the Volkswagen Group alone, Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen are all actively pursuing BEVs with two officially in the works -- including Porsche's Mission E and Audi's Q6 e-Tron -- and one already on sale, the Volkswagen e-Golf. Additionally, there are six other proposals within the Volkswagen Group for BEV models including an all-electric Beetle, a compact crossover, a sedan, and a two-seat sports car that reportedly has a drag coefficient of under 0.20. A variant of the MQB platform called the MEB is already in the works, but potential budget issues related to the diesel emissions scandal could cause issues for Volkswagen. As a result, Volkswagen could develop a single modular platform for high- and low-floor applications that all brands can use on everything from high-end models to more affordable cars.\n\nBMW is currently expected to refresh the i3 in 2018 and the i8 in 2019, with the latter gaining a more powerful battery sometime later this year. The third i-car, dubbed as project iX and possibly to be called the i5, is rumored to be a four-door hatchback with subtle SUV elements such as body cladding. Underpinning the i5 will be a flat battery storage assembly, known internally as FSAR that's closely related to the rear-drive modular system called CLAR. Vehicles underpinned by FSAR and CLAR will also share software technologies such as Ethernet and 5G mobile connectivity needed for fully autonomous driving.\n\nMercedes-Benz, on the other hand, will debut its electric vehicle architecture called EVA2 in 2021 and will introduce a mildly restyled all-electric GLC-Class crossover called the ELC in 2018, which will feature two electric motors and torque-vectoring all-wheel drive. A smaller GLA-Class-based ELA and B-Class-based GLB should arrive by 2021. Mercedes' EVA2 platform will be modular and aluminum extensive as well as fully flexible in length, width, track, wheelbase, and height. Four models are expected to launch under EVA2, including two sedans and two crossovers. AMG models are also expected for the all-electric vehicles that will use the EVA2 platform. In terms of price, EVA2 models will have similar pricing as their gas or diesel counterparts.\n\nFor more on these EV plans, head over to AUTOMOBILE.", "Alfa Romeo seems to have a big problem with delivering on promises. Although the upcoming Giulia looks epic, production delays have postponed the sedan's arrival in the US. As of now, the 4C is the only available model from the Italian automaker. The 4C is an interesting little sports car, but we doubt that many people will be cross shopping it with higher-volume models from BMW or Porsche. In order to truly compete with other luxury automakers, Alfa needs to deliver on its promises and bring more cars stateside!", "Chief Marketing Officer for Kanetix.ca, Canada's largest online financial services comparison website\n\nThis year the Canadian International AutoShow drew in a record 320,000 attendees who drooled over the latest and greatest cars and car technology from automakers. And for the first time ever, the show featured a Street Tuner exhibit, showcasing cars that look like they came straight out of a Fast and Furious movie.\n\nStreet tuners are vehicles with modified equipment that improve performance or make them unique in their appearance. But even though they are completely legal for regular driving, most insurance companies shy away from providing coverage for tuners.\n\nInsurance policies and rates are built around the value of the car they are covering, its likelihood of being involved in an accident, and its risk of being stolen.\n\nModifications change the monetary value of the vehicle. Aesthetic changes can increase appeal to thieves. And safety becomes questionable when the car can accelerate faster and noise from tuned exhausts can alter driving behaviour. With that being said, some insurance companies do not have adequate coverage policies for cars modified for speed and performance. But there are ways to still protect your hot mod.\n\nCheck out these cars owned by Deadmau5 - electronic/house music producer and performer. Both cars were modified with factory options from McLaren and Lamborghini. Most automakers have a performance division for modifications (for example, Mercedes has the AMG division, BMW has the M division). When cars are tuned by the manufacturer or if the modifications are just cosmetic, it is easier to find insurance. Deadmau5's Lamborghini and McLaren are wrapped with unique colours and graphics by Sekanskin.\n\nThere are many street tuners just made for show, and only transported to and from shows. They are entered into competitions or used for business to showcase and sell after-market parts. Typically, to ensure you are covered for the value of the vehicle, an appraisal is required and the vehicle will be insured to the value based on the appraisal.\n\nRacing Street Tuners\n\n2010 Ferrari 458 Italia with Twin Turbo System modification. Engine produces 700 horsepower.\n\n2012 Audi R8 GT with Twin Turbo modifications. Engine produces 850 horsepower.\n\nEurocharged Canada also rolled out some awesome tuners. These cars are highly modified to go fast and let it rip on the race track. Want to take it for a spin? Well, you are going to need track day insurance. A track day insurance policy will pay for damage to your vehicle on the day of a race. It is a policy that is purchased for one specific event unlike a regular auto policy which is usually purchased for a term typically one year. This vehicle does not include liability coverage and protects only the value of the vehicle. To cover any liability for damages including injury and damage to other vehicles, you will likely need to purchase a commercial auto insurance policy.\n\nAnd if all else fails, some people can insure legal street tuners through Facility Association - a not-for-profit organization that offers insurance to licensed drivers when they are unable to get insurance through the voluntary insurance market.\n\nInsurance rates compensate for a large part of the total ownership cost for any vehicle. Be sure to check with your insurance company to verify if your coverage will change before making any modifications to your vehicle.", "LA JOLLA, CA -The 12 Annual La Jolla Concours d'Elegance will be a highly anticipated weekend once again.

Several models will make their world debut, starting with the new BMW M760Li xDrive. Also making its debut appearance will be the iPerformance model designation which, from July 2016, will identify the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand in all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\nNext on the debut list is the BMW i8 Protonic Red Limited Edition.

It will be seen first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, e.g. the BMW 740e iPerformance. The iPerformance models will benefit from the transfer of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems.

London, Nottingham, Bristol and Milton Keynes will get the lion's share of this investment after being announced the winners of a Go Ultra Low scheme based upon their proposals to encourage local residents to consider switching to a plug-in car. Elsewhere, the scheme is also providing \u00a35 million of development funding for specific initiatives in Dundee, Oxford, York and north east regions to help them play their part in kick-starting a UK-wide clean motoring revolution.\n\nEach main prize winning city was awarded a share of the fund for implementing cutting edge technology such as rapid-charging hubs and Light & Charge technology from BMW - a smart LED street lamp which doubles up as an electric vehicle charging point. Oxford, home to MINI and Plant Oxford where the majority of MINIs are produced will get \u00a3800,000 to trial different charging options.\n\nThe government believes these innovations will not only support the UK's thriving green vehicle sector but improve air quality in urban hotspots and will broadly help the government meet its emission cutting targets. Plug-in-car owners also benefit from local privileges from the scheme. Access to bus lanes in city centers, up to 25,000 free parking spaces, which could save commuters as much as \u00a31,300 a year, a large growth in charging stations and discounted leasing schemes will all be on offer.\n\nTransport for London aims to have 70,000 ULEVs a year sold by 2020 and almost quarter of a million by 2025.", "The car sharing service DriveNow is to expand its visibility and enhance ease of use and transportation choice with the integration of the app, Moovit.

European demand and industry profits are up, but so too is regulatory pressure to cut pollution.\n\nThe car show will display the usual raft of high-horsepower luxury vehicles such as the Maserati Levante, Bugatti Chiron and the Lamborghini Centenario.\n\nBut this traditional recipe for success looks a bit out of step during a regulatory crackdown on vehicles with excessive levels of toxic emissions.\n\n\"This year a thick diesel cloud hangs over Geneva,\" Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the CAR-Center Automotive Research said, noting that just over half of cars sold in Europe are powered by diesel engines.\n\nVW's admission in September that it cheated U.S. pollution tests has exposed how far behind Europe's premium car makers are when it comes to sales of hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nFigures compiled for Reuters by LMC Automotive show that German trio BMW, Mercedes-Benz and VW's Audi - the world's largest producers of luxury cars - rank only in 12th 14th and 22nd when it comes to annual sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, trailing leaders Toyota, Honda, Lexus and Nissan.\n\nThe Geneva Motor Show schedule includes no launches for pure electric cars by prominent brands, apart from a new version of Daimler's Smart car. Porsche, Audi and others are, however, working on new pure-battery luxury cars by 2019.\n\nCar makers have instead responded to a more frugal era by toning down some of their conventional offerings.\n\nFor example, Porsche's 718 roadster, which replaces the Boxster, will be offered as a four cylinder car and Opel's GT concept vehicle has a three-cylinder engine.\n\nHowever, customers are increasingly opting for larger cars which tend to use more fuel, demonstrating a widening disparity between customer tastes and regulatory demands.\n\nFor the first time, European sales of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) overtook those of conventional cars last year, outselling the traditional subcompact and compact vehicle segments, according to analysts at JATO.\n\nNew smaller SUVs such as Audi's Q2 and the Seat Ateca, both due to be displayed in Geneva, aim to capitalize on this trend.\n\nLarger cars, though, require more expensive technology investments to meet tougher anti-pollution rules, at a time when analysts fear demand globally is starting to wane.\n\nIn a note titled \"The end of an era\", Bernstein Research analysts said the outlook for the European industry had dimmed.\n\n\"Europe is a market where unfortunately the auto industry has little hope of making any money, as it is beset with overcapacity, very high structural costs, and is populated by too many auto makers all offering technically sophisticated and expensive-to-build vehicles,\" they wrote.", "FOCUS Online/Wochit (41), dpa/Sven Hoppe, press-inform / Mazda, FOCUS Online/Jukin, Screenshot/ZDF, dpa/Uwe Anspach (2), dpa/Inga Kjer, Caters, dpa/ADAC, M1Molter, Metropolitan Police, Bongarts/Getty Images, dpa/Andrea Warnecke, ADAC, Getty Images (2), dpa/Ingo Wagner, FOL, Zoomin.TV (2), AltoPress / Maxppp, Michael B\u00fcchel, dpa/Michael Kappeler, FOCUS Online (16), The Nu Project, Bit Projects (11), Andreas Richter, Viralhog, Marko Cickovic, foc, Colourbox.de (4), BARCROFT, Audi, FOCUS, FOCUS Online/Oliver Markert (2), Wikipedia, ViralHog, CHIP (3), Mini, Rosenbach (2), Viehmann (2), dpa (3), Deutscher Bundestag, dpa/Frank Leonhardt, Porsche (2), LiveLeak (2), HuffingtonPost, dpa/Joedson Alves, FOCUS Online/NonStopNews, dpa/Bernd von Jutrczenka, Ruptly, Weather Channel, Huffington Post/Wochit (4), BitProjects, BMW (2), Bloodhound SSC, dpa/Georgi Licovski (2), ZDF Enterprises (3), dpa/Martin Wichmann, dpa/Vorwerk, Jukin Media, AT&T\n\nAlle Inhalte, insbesondere die Texte und Bilder von Agenturen, sind urheberrechtlich gesch\u00fctzt und d\u00fcrfen nur im Rahmen der gew\u00f6hnlichen Nutzung des Angebots vervielf\u00e4ltigt, verbreitet oder sonst genutzt werden.", "The Mercedes-Maybach S600 is one of the finest luxury limos money can buy.\n\nThe Maybach name returned last year after a brief hiatus as the flagship model of Mercedes' S-Class line instead of a stand alone brand.\n\nNow, Mercedes has a new armored version of the Maybach called the \"Guard\" edition.\n\nAccording to Mercedes, the Maybach Guard is the first civilian vehicle to be certified with VR10 level ballistics protection.\n\nThat means the Maybach's body and windows are designed to withstand hardened steel-core bullets fired from assault rifles.\n\nAnd that's exactly what they did.

A critical issue is the relative lack of research on the role of the human in the system. This human factors component may represent more daunting challenges than technological, legal, and security concerns of self-driving cars.\n\nAdvancing the state of knowledge about human factors aspects of autonomous passenger vehicles are two studies published recently in Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. One paper assesses the level of drivers' trust in the autonomous car by monitoring how often they interrupt a nondriving task to look at their surroundings. This study presents the first empirical evidence making this connection.\n\nThe other study suggests that drivers will respond best to verbal prompts, as opposed to sounds or visual displays, alerting them to driving conditions and the state of the vehicle (for example, low tire pressure).\n\n\"Keep Your Scanners Peeled: Gaze Behavior as a Measure of Automation Trust During Highly Automated Driving\" is the work of Sebastian Hergeth, Lutz Lorenz, and Roman Vilimek of the BMW Group in Munich, and Josef F. Krems from Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Germany.\n\nIn this study, 35 BMW Group employees ages 18 to 55 participated in a self-driving car simulation while engaging in a visually demanding nondriving task. The driving scenario was a standard three-lane highway with a hard shoulder in which uneventful driving was periodically interrupted by incidents requiring the driver to take control. Although trust is difficult to quantify, drivers' use of eye-tracking glasses enabled the researchers to capture data about how frequently participants looked away from the secondary task to observe the driving scene. Hergeth et al. then used these data to draw preliminary conclusions about drivers' levels of trust in the simulated car's automation.\n\nThe more the participants trusted the automation, the less frequently they looked at their surroundings. They were also more trusting of the car once they learned the system. Overall, more than half the drivers said they trusted the car more at the end than at the beginning of the trials. The researchers postulate that appropriate trust in automation is crucial for drivers to get the maximum benefit from self-driving vehicles.\n\nIn \"Speech Auditory Alerts Promote Memory for Alerted Events in a Video-Simulated Self-Driving Car Ride,\" human factors researchers Michael A. Ness, Benji Helbein, and Anna Porter of Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania, studied the usefulness of speech alerts to help drivers perceive and remember driving conditions while engaged in a nondriving activity.\n\nEighty-five undergraduate students performed a word search task while watching three driving simulation videos. Each scenario showed a routine driving condition. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three display conditions: sounds such as a jackhammer, indicating construction ahead; a visual display with text; and speech alerts such as \"pedestrian\" or \"front hazard.\"\n\nAfter watching the videos, participants reported what they recalled about the driving scenario, how useful and how annoying the alerts were, and how confident they would feel if they had to resume control of the car at the moment the video stopped. Participants who heard the speech alerts had better recall than those who were given the sound icons or visual displays. However, both audio alerts were rated as annoying, and studies show that annoying alerts have a tendency to be turned off.\n\nBoth research teams plan further investigations to assess how these areas of study can impact safety and how quickly and effectively drivers would take over the controls when necessary.", "THE grieving brother of a talented young rugby player killed following a car crash has said his death has left a \"huge hole\" in their family's life.\n\nMacauley Campbell, known as Mac, who died on Saturday night, hours after he was named man-of-the-match in a top of the table clash.\n\nNow friends and family have received a message of condolence from pop star Craig David, who they contacted about possibly playing a gig in Mac's memory.\n\nAnd a host of other celebrities ranging from DJs and reality TV stars to Saints players past and present have all expressed their support to the gigs, which is called Macfest.\n\nMac's brother Luke has paid tribute to the 20-year-old Romsey Rugby Club player as an \"amazing\" person and has thanked hundreds of mourners who have left flowers and held candle lit vigils at the spot where the crash happened.\n\nIt comes as Luke revealed an internet crowdfunding page has raised an incredible \u00a311,000 in the days since his death.\n\nMac died after his black VW Lupo was involved in a collision with another car on the A3057 near Romsey Golf Club at about 10.30pm that night.\n\nEvery night hundreds of grief-stricken people have held candlelit vigils, laid flower bouquets, mementos, rugby balls and heartfelt messages for the former Mountbatten School pupil from Rownhams.\n\nThe former Whitenap Lane school prefect's death has \"rocked\" the rugby community and has left Romsey Rugby club struggling to come to terms with the loss of one of their star players who helped guide them to victory against a rival club.\n\nHis brother Luke hailed Mac as \"amazing\" and said: \"He is one of those guys who is going to be really missed and Mac has left a huge hole in everyone's lives.

Because he believed the jury would understand his reasons--the engineer said it was the only way he could defend himself against uncontrollable road rage by the other driver.\n\nEngineer Dinh Bowman, at one time considered a genius and child prodigy, says the incident began when he accidentally cut off a car driven by a man named Yancy Noll as both men were driving home from work in August 2012. Bowman says that Noll followed him off the highway and exploded in rage when the cars came to a stop side-by-side at a red light in a quiet residential neighborhood.\n\n\"I felt like it was just this crazy bad dream, and I was runnin' from a monster,\" said Bowman who was driving a BMW convertible sports car. \"There was sort of-- a stream of swearin'\n\n\"I think the phrase that caught my attention was 'You better learn how to drive that fancy car, dick boy. Or you're gonna get yourself f***ed up.'\"\n\nAfter a bottle went flying in his direction, Bowman says he feared for his life. Bowman says he retaliated by pulling out his gun and firing. He asked the jury to understand his desperate measures: \"If I didn't do something right then, I was goin' to die.\"\n\nProsecutors scoffed at Bowman's defense and claimed that there was another reason entirely that he killed Yancy Noll--a thirst to commit the perfect murder of a stranger, and that this was not road rage but a thrill kill. That story will be featured this week on \"48 Hours.\"\n\nRoad rage is a well-known phenomenon. A detailed AAA study done in the 1990s found that road rage resulted in 218 murders over a seven-year period. Other published reports claim that as many 1,500 injuries and deaths can be traced to road rage in any one year.\n\nWhatever the number, the parade of murders linked to road rage seems never to fade from the headlines.\n\nBut why do people explode in rage when behind the wheel and get so aggravated over a perceived or real slight that they drive recklessly or, in Bowman's case, pull out a gun and fire? What is it about driving that pushes some people's buttons?\n\nPsychologists point to something called \"deindividuation,\" defined as \"loss of self- awareness and of individual accountability in a group.\"\n\nCalifornia psychologist Robert Nemerovski has studied road rage extensively. He says that, although most of us don't think of driving as social, \"it consists of countless subtle interpersonal interactions per mile,\" he told the Pacific Sun newspaper in an extensive interview.\n\nAt the same time, however, cars make us feel anonymous and foster the idea that no one knows who we are as we drive along alone, sometime with tinted windows. The car is, in essence, our domain.\n\nThat combination of factors, Nemerovski says \"has been shown in several prominent studies to lead to a psychological state called 'deindividuation,' which is believed to reduce our inhibitions to perform antisocial behavior. Essentially, if we believe no one can identify us, we are more likely to engage in antisocial, even hostile behavior.\"\n\nIt is not an accident that the most serious road rage incidents occur when a person is driving alone. If others are present in the car, drivers are less likely to act out in the most extreme way.\n\nIf road rage on some level is something that many of us are familiar with, might Dinh Bowman's unique defense work with the jury? Prosecutors scoffed at his defense and said Bowman was \"a student of murder\" who'd been training himself to commit the perfect murder for years.\n\nWhen he found the \"right\" victim under the \"right\" circumstances, they said, he blasted away.\n\nPaul LaRosa is a \"48 Hours\" producer.

The Houston Opera has offered free season tickets to patrons who lost their jobs in the oil bust. A fancy restaurant offers cut-price dinners.\n\nTwenty months into the worst oil price crash since the 1980s, well-heeled residents of the world's oil capital are among the hardest hit largely because tanking energy firm shares make up much of oil and gas executives' compensation.\n\nIn River Oaks, a neighborhood of palatial mansions and lush gardens, the average sales price of a home has tumbled to $1.3 million from $2 million in the middle of 2014 when oil began its more than 70 percent slide, according to data from the Houston Association of Realtors and Keller Williams. Median property prices in the area have already fallen further in this downturn, which is not yet over, than the 16 percent drop in the previous oil slump in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\"When oil does well, River Oaks does well. When oil does bad River Oaks does bad,\" said Paige Martin, a Keller Williams broker who specializes in the neighborhood. \"Not everybody can afford a $10 million house.\"\n\nCity-wide data also show that while overall sales of single family homes fell 2 percent in January, sales of those priced over $500,000 tumbled 9 percent. The overall median house price was $200,000, up 5 percent on the year, according to the realtors' association.\n\nWhile Houston's economy is far more diversified now than in the 1980s when the city lost 13 percent of its jobs, it remains home to 5,000 energy-related firms and the fortunes of oil and gas executives are tied more than ever to the energy market.\n\nSince U.S. lawmakers passed a law in 1992 encouraging \"performance-based\" pay, the share of stock options in executive compensation has steadily increased, said David Bixby, head of the Houston office for Pearl Meyer compensation consultants.\n\n\"Now, you're looking at 70 to 80 percent of CEO compensation in stock on average for oil and gas companies,\" he said. \"They are going to be exposed to commodity price cycles.\"\n\nACROBATS AND FOR SALE SIGN\n\nFor example, former oil executive, Kolja Rockov, whose extravagant wedding with dancers and acrobats became a local online sensation three years ago, briefly put his unfinished mansion on the market for $6.9 million, according to listings.\n\nA Jan. 21, 2015 SEC filing showed he involuntarily sold 239,000 shares of the company's tanking stock he had used as a collateral for a loan. Rockov lost his job as Linn Energy LLC's CFO in August.\n\nRockov said the house is actively under construction, isn't for sale, and that he left his job by mutual consent.

The full-size SUV will vie with the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, along with newcomers such as the Maserati Levante, in an increasingly crowded segment. Audi's success is crucial to fill Volkswagen's coffers as the embattled automaker searches for its footing amid the six-month-old emissions scandal.\n\nMarket leader BMW used SUVs to maintain dominance for a decade and all three competitors have rushed to fill niches in the market. With the little Q2, Audi has zeroed in on a segment BMW and Mercedes haven't touched. The car is designed to lure young city dwellers who require less space than in the $33,700 Q3.\n\nWhile European deliveries of subcompact SUVs like the Q2 will more than double to about 2.1 million units in the five years to 2022, Audi's growth will still lag rivals, said Tim Urquhart, a London-based analyst with IHS Automotive. IHS estimates Audi will remain in third place through 2022 and end this year with a 1.2 percent sales gain to 1.83 million cars, slower growth than either BMW or Mercedes.\n\nRegaining Ground\n\nIn addition to the new models, Audi's chances of upending that prediction hang on China, its biggest market. Car sales there will probably start growing robustly again and Audi stands to benefit from the new version of its best-selling Q5 SUV set for a production start by the end of the year, said Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst for Commerzbank.\n\n\"I expect Audi to start regaining some ground, in particular compared to BMW,\" Gommel said. BMW has fewer new cars in the pipeline. It has also been unusually assertive in boosting U.S. deliveries by paying dealers to put new models in their service fleets, people familiar with the practice said this month.\n\nAfter rolling out the Q7, Q5 and Q2, Audi plans to introduce its first all-electric crossover in 2018, followed by a new full-size SUV dubbed Q8 a year later. Also on the table is a higher-riding crossover version of the TT sports car.\n\nAudi Profits\n\nThe strategy is key for the bottom line. Audi's SUV buyers spend about two-thirds more on extra features than buyers of a comparable sedan, the company said. They're also loyal; two out of three Audi SUV customers buy another crossover as their next car.\n\nProtecting Audi's sales and profits is vital as Volkswagen faces billions of euros in costs triggered by its admission to cheating on emissions tests. Audi hasn't been untouched, accounting for some 2.3 million of the diesel cars affected across the group.\n\nIt also developed a motor that came under U.S. regulators' scrutiny a few months after the scandal first broke. Talks in the U.S. are still going on and Audi has remained tight-lipped about the anticipated financial impact.\n\n\"We do see a certain effect from the U.S. sales stop on diesel models, but we remain optimistic,\" Voggenreiter said, adding that in Europe, the brand expects to see the scandal resolved by the end of the year. \"This issue won't set us back, particularly in the long term.\"", "The unfinished home of former oil executive Kolja Rockov is seen at 12 Crestwood Drive in Houston, Texas ...\n\n(This version of the Feb. 25 story corrects with Kolja Rockov stating house actively under construction and not for sale in paragraph 11)\n\nBy Terry Wade and Anna Driver\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - Prices for mansions in Houston's swankiest neighborhood have tumbled in lock step with crude prices.

The overall median house price was $200,000, up 5 percent on the year, according to the realtors' association.\n\nWhile Houston's economy is far more diversified now than in the 1980s when the city lost 13 percent of its jobs, it remains home to 5,000 energy-related firms and the fortunes of oil and gas executives are tied more than ever to the energy market.\n\nSince U.S. lawmakers passed a law in 1992 encouraging \"performance-based\" pay, the share of stock options in executive compensation has steadily increased, said David Bixby, head of the Houston office for Pearl Meyer compensation consultants.\n\n\"Now, you're looking at 70 to 80 percent of CEO compensation in stock on average for oil and gas companies,\" he said. \"They are going to be exposed to commodity price cycles.\"\n\nFor example, former oil executive, Kolja Rockov, whose extravagant wedding with dancers and acrobats became a local online sensation three years ago, briefly put his unfinished mansion on the market for $6.9 million, according to listings.\n\nA Jan. 21, 2015 SEC filing showed he involuntarily sold 239,000 shares of the company's tanking stock he had used as a collateral for a loan. Rockov lost his job as Linn Energy LLC's <LINE.O> CFO in August.\n\nRockov said the house is actively under construction, isn't for sale, and that he left his job by mutual consent. A Nov. 5 SEC filing said he was \"terminated without cause.\"\n\nLuxury car sales are also slower in Houston than in other parts of the state and the country.\n\n\"If you're working for an energy company, you see all this stress around you, it might nick your purchase confidence, even if you are fairly high income,\" Earl Hesterberg, chief executive of Houston-based Group 1 Automotive Inc <GPI.N>, told Reuters.\n\nHe said excess inventory was most acute for top line BMW <BMWG.DE> and Mercedes-Benz <DAIGn.DE> models in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nIn a nod to the downturn, Ouisie's Table, a River Oaks institution, is now offering its \"Oil Barrel Bargain,\" a three course dinner for the price of a barrel of oil, now around $30.\n\nTo be sure, oil executives are not alone in feeling the pain. Many blue collar jobs in oilfield equipment production have disappeared. So have thousands of middle management jobs in oil exploration and production. A regular Uber customer is likely at some point to ride with a former energy industry professional.\n\n\"It pays for the mortgage,\" said Matthew Clemonds, who once did mapping for pipeline companies and now works for the ride-sharing company.\n\nJob growth has slowed to a crawl from the breakneck pace of 100,000 a year during the oil boom; housing starts are down and subleasing of new office space is rising, according to government data and NAI Partners, a real estate consultancy.\n\nBut so far, owing to its diversity, the metropolitan economy has shown remarkable resilience, adding 20,000 jobs to just over 3 million last year.\n\nFor example, Houston is home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest cluster of hospitals, research facilities and affiliated universities, which says it employs 106,000.\n\nIn the energy sector, about $50 billion being invested in new petrochemical plants to take advantage of cheap supplies is helping offset upstream job losses.\n\n\"This is the best oil price downturn we have ever had,\" said Ted Jones, chief economist at Stewart Title Guaranty Company. \"We still have more jobs than we have ever had in history.\"\n\nBill Gilmer, a University of Houston economist, says so far it has paid off to tough it out through oil's booms and busts and notes that ever since 1969 Houston has consistently ranked among the fastest growing U.S. cities.\n\n\"The only problem is that it can be a rollercoaster.\"\n\n(Additonal reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)", "Today, a Colorado megachurch embraces electric cars, a Federal judge tells Volkswagen to find a fix for its diesel cars by the end of March, and General Motors adds an eAssist mild-hybrid option for the 2016 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks.

And not in a good way.\n\n\"There was something like a tsunami,\" Hans-Gerd Bode, Volkswagen's communications chief since September, said in an interview. \"Thousands of calls and emails coming in at the same time.\"\n\n\"A crisis like this, the company was not prepared for,\" he said. With the company continuing to negotiate with foreign governments, \"We don't know the right way out.\"\n\nIn the months since it admitted it designed its diesel cars to cheat on tailpipe-emissions tests, the company has struggled with its messaging. A low point came last month when Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive, visited the United States and told NPR, \"We didn't lie,\" when VW clearly did. The outcry forced Mr. M\u00fcller to call NPR back and revise his statement.\n\nThe reaction to the scandal has been swift. A recent Harris Poll of Americans' attitudes toward the 100 most visible companies ranked Volkswagen dead last.\n\nIt has been a humbling fall for a company known for generations for its deft ability to create a friendly image, from its revolutionary 1960s marketing campaign for the original Beetle to VW's 2011 Super Bowl commercial featuring a boy dressed as Darth Vader, using the Force to turn on a Passat. More recently, Volkswagen has preached its environmental virtues -- emphasizing its diesels -- as a selling point.\n\nThe scale of Volkswagen's crisis makes it a particularly unusual case. Even some of the largest corporate crises in the past were focused in a single market, whether it was BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill or Google's battle with European regulators over data privacy.\n\nBut Volkswagen, which includes the Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini brands, faces a crisis that traverses the globe, complicating the response across borders and cultures. For instance, the company has argued that German privacy laws prevent it from fully cooperating with American investigators. On the other side of the world, prosecutors in South Korea are threatening to bring criminal charges against executives there.\n\nAt the same time, Volkswagen is an insular company based in a country that prefers to tightly manage and script press interactions.\n\nIt is Mr. Bode's job to clean up the mess. Before the scandal, he was top spokesman for VW's Porsche division, hosting media events featuring vintage sports cars and the glamorous tennis star Maria Sharapova. Now he's leading the damage control in a globe-spanning public relations crisis.\n\nVW should have known it was headed for a disaster. For more than a year, the company told American regulators that its diesels simply had a technical problem that was causing tailpipe emissions to soar on the road. Then last September, Volkswagen admitted it had created software to detect and thwart laboratory tests for pollutants that pose health hazards.\n\nIts chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, chalked it up to \"the mistakes of a few people.\" Few believed that was true, however, considering that the scandal involves 11 million vehicles and engines developed over several years.\n\nWhen he resigned a few days later, Mr. Winterkorn said: \"I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part.\" Recently, internal documents suggested he may have been aware of the issue as far back as May 2014.\n\nSince then, the company's approach has often faltered. While VW has admitted cheating in the United States and is making good-will payments to customers, it has claimed that the same behavior was not illegal under European rules. So VW is not paying European customers, even though it is recalling its cars in both markets.\n\nMany Europeans are not pleased. \"You've treated European customers with disdain,\" one member of the British Parliament complained to VW's top executive in Britain at a hearing last month.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Bode offered a more contrite message. \"There's no doubt that we built up things within the cars which were completely wrong and which worked against the laws,\" he said, when asked about VW's posture in Europe.\n\nWhile there have been many past automotive crises, this one is fundamentally different. Consumers are used to automotive safety recalls big and small. There was General Motors' crisis involving defective ignition switches and Toyota's scandal related to sudden vehicle acceleration. Honda was recently fined $70 million for not reporting safety problems.\n\nBut Volkswagen is seen as particularly brazen. The public tends to show \"a little more tolerance\" for recalls and labor issues, said Wendy Salomon, a vice president at Nielsen, which conducted the recent Harris Poll. But the polling, she said, showed respondents were \"least tolerant\" of \"lying and misrepresentation and intentional wrongdoing.\"\n\nWhile it is not the first time American regulators have caught an automaker using a so-called defeat device -- a mechanism or software used to thwart emissions tests -- the Volkswagen deception takes place on a global scale, from a company that marketed itself as environmentally sensitive, and at a time when emissions regulation is being taken increasingly seriously.\n\nSome missteps have been clear. Promotion of insiders, including Mr. M\u00fcller, a trusted longtime lieutenant of Mr. Winterkorn, is not a hallmark of a fresh start. Treating customers differently in Europe and the United States is asking for trouble.\n\nVolkswagen has been scrambling to enlist help. The company has brought in three public relations firms based in three different countries -- Kekst in the United States, Finsbury in Britain and Hering Schuppener in Germany -- to join Edelman, an American firm already on retainer. VW has been paying Richard Gaul, the former communications chief of BMW, 20,000 euros a month, about $22,000, to work as a part-time, 60-hour-a-month consultant, according to a contract reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Bode, however, said Mr. Gaul had been advising the company on other matters.\n\nVW also hired Jones Day, a law firm, to conduct an internal investigation, though the firm's own website said it helps clients determine \"whether and how to voluntarily disclose criminal conduct to the government,\" suggesting disclosing criminal conduct is not a foregone conclusion. The top executive at VW's Porsche division has already said he is hoping to reinstate Wolfgang Hatz, the suspended engineering chief who is seen as a central figure in the scandal.\n\nMr. Bode himself was part of a broad reshuffle of management from within the company's ranks. He said VW had revived a \"newsroom\" for rapid response to inquiries on the scandal from the news media and others, made up of 15 to 20 employees from the communications and sales teams and people with technical expertise. VW had such a newsroom during a prostitution scandal in 2007 and 2008 involving the company and its trade unions.\n\nMr. Bode accompanied Mr. M\u00fcller on his trip to the United States where he made the controversial statement. \"It was my failure,\" Mr. Bode said. He said the questioning, around the Detroit auto show, was too chaotic, with many reporters asking questions. He said he should have organized more individual interviews to forestall confusion.\n\n\"If you have situations like this where the C.E.O. is doing his first step into this market where you have the biggest problem, and there are millions of questions in the air, then you have to say, 'Let's do it in a more organized way,' \" he said.\n\nThe company is also overhauling its advertising message. \"Das Auto,\" the chest-thumping old slogan, is out. The simpler tagline \"Volkswagen\" is in. Since apologizing in newspapers after the scandal broke, the company has been keeping a relatively low profile.\n\nMr. Bode said Volkswagen was awaiting a resolution to its continuing talks with American regulators before settling on a new marketing strategy in the United States. Discussions have been contentious. The Environmental Protection Agency and regulators in California and Canada have accused the company of installing defeat device software in a set of larger vehicles that were not among those included in Volkswagen's admissions.\n\n\"We have to start with this campaign when we have agreed to a solution with the authorities.\" Mr. Bode said. \"Then we have to see the overall picture.\"\n\nIrving Schenkler, a professor and crisis management expert at New York University, said there have been few parallels in history. \"It's unprecedented in terms of the cross-national scope of it, the degree of the problems,\" he said. \"There are so many different fronts.\"\n\nEven in Germany, the news media has hardly given the company a free pass. \"VW is overwhelmed,\" said Kayhan \u00d6zgenc, a reporter at Bild am Sonntag, a newspaper that has been particularly aggressive, adding, \"It was a change from paradise directly into hell, from the most profitable carmaker to an emergency situation.\"\n\nMr. Bode, for his part, has been critical. \"What the German press did was call everything wrong which is and was done by the company,\" he said.\n\nManaging the crisis, he added, has been \"a step-by-step thing, learning by doing.\" Someday, he said, he could become a university professor and give speeches on how to manage a crisis. \"Hundreds of speeches,\" he said. \"That's a joke. We are far away from joking about this. It's a deep, deep thing for the company.\""], "2016-02-29": ["When I met my wife-to-be in 1978, she didn't know I liked \"military stuff.\" I wasn't hiding anything, because military-related hobbies were far from my mind at that time. This is a story of how things in life can come full circle.\n\nLike a lot of boys who grew up in the 1950s and 1960s, my brother and I played with cap guns and often dressed up as cowboys or soldiers. Life was all about Davy Crockett and Sgt. Rock. I used to run around in front of my house with my father's Type 99 Arisaka \"bring back\" rifle. Imagine doing that now!\n\nFor hours, I would draw tanks, ships, airplanes, then spend allowance money on plastic models, sets of miniature soldiers, and military comic books. As a teenager, this faded when I discovered motorcycles and an off-road riding club. My job at a grocery store paid for many dirt and street bikes. This evolved into motocross racing for a year, and then I switched to oval tracks. College put a damper on my racing career before it ended. It was time to slow down.\n\nIn 1978, Marilynn and I were set up by friends to go on a blind date to a snow skiing show in San Francisco. That was our shared hobby. At that time, I liked guns and hunting, which she didn't take to. She did like to fish, so after we were married in 1980, we travelled to the Mt. Shasta and Burney Falls areas to camp and trout fish -- and of course, we skied. I had a BMW street bike and she enjoyed riding on the back of it. She knew about the racing background, but little of my childhood interests.\n\nIn 1985, I decided to come out of retirement and try Class A speedway racing. A speedway bike works very differently from any other kind of motorcycle. It is very light and powerful on alcohol, with steering geometry designed to be thrown into a dirt turn completely sideways on the power using the throttle to steer. Normal Class C bikes have to be slowed down going into the corner with the rear brake or by sliding one or both tires, then the throttle is applied coming out with a small rear wheel slide. Because speedway is so different, I borrowed a Jawa race bike and went to a rider training class led by a prominent professional.\n\nThis ended badly. The unnatural riding style caused me to tire and stiffen, whereupon I dumped the bike and nearly dislocated my left shoulder!\n\nThe next week doing sales visits, I had to open the massive door of my Buick Regal by reaching across with my right hand. Not good. Then Marilynn said something that was to change our lives: \"What are you doing? Aren't you a little old to be racing? Why don't you buy an antique Harley and go slow for a change?\"\n\nTRADING THE RACING HELMET FOR A STEEL POT\n\nI started learning about vintage bikes. One trip to the big antique meet in Sacramento was an eye-opener because I learned there was such a thing as a WWII military motorcycle. I saw a BSA M20, Harley WLA, and two XAs. This brought back nice memories of military equipment. Right then I decided to combine past and current interests. The hunt for a military motorcycle was on!\n\nThe first bike we looked at was a BMW R75M heavy sidecar rig offered for $10,000. This was a lot, because in 1985, a WLA was $5,000. On the test drive with the owner on the back seat and Marilynn in the sidecar, I went to pull to the side of the road and forgot the sidecar was there. Up the curb it went! Good thing there wasn't a parking meter there. This scooter was a bit much, so we passed.\n\nThe next lead was for a 1941 Indian 640 with 437 miles on it. We arranged to see it. I guess I forgot to tell her it was military because when she saw the OD thing with the star on the tank, she said, \"I was expecting a red Indian with chrome and a chief picture on the tank.\" It was priced like a WLA, so we bought it.\n\nLater we found out the military 45 cubic inch 640s were very rare. There were about 4,400 bought by the Army and most of the surplus bikes were converted to look like the 1941 Sport Scout which was arguably the best looking Indian made, or they were used up on race tracks.\n\nWe learned of the Military Vehicle Collectors Club and a local one called the California Chapter, MVCC. We joined both.\n\nOur first event was the \"40 Years After\" military show in a pier building at Ft. Mason in San Francisco that had been an embarkation/debarkation pier during WWII.\n\nIn the Veteran's Day parade just prior to the show, I was on the bike dressed in a U.S. Ike jacket uniform sporting a First Special Service Force shoulder patch. At a pause in the parade, an old guy walked out from the crowd, put his finger on the patch, and said, \"Where did you get that?\" Turned out he was a Devil's Brigade vet! Right then, I knew this was more than just a car club for lazy collectors who don't like to wax them!\n\nIn April 1986, we attended our first big military vehicle meet, the Patterson Rally. I started acquiring uniforms and gear. On sales trips, I would visit surplus, antique, and thrift stores.\n\nAfter the purchase of a BSA folding military bicycle I decided I needed a British battledress setup which led to meeting Major Jerry Lee who was stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco. He had just started importing British WWII uniforms and equipment to sell out of his quarters (don't tell anybody) and I was one of his first customers. He gave me a good enough deal so I'd buy multiples, not knowing then that I would end up with enough British WWII kit to outfit a dozen mannequins in different Army uniform versions. Jerry now owns \"What Price Glory,\" an excellent source for U.S. and British reproduction uniforms.\n\nTwo more BSA folders were added to the collection, a 1942 GPW, and then a 1944 Ford M20. It has been a great hobby for 30 years and \"female friendly\" enough so Marilynn enjoys it, although she misses the \"civilian\" camping and fishing.\n\nMy concern is there are not many young people getting involved. We took our son Jeff to the Patterson meet at age four months and to many after that. He learned how to drive the jeep at the Big Bear meet. But with high school, came sports, computer gaming, then college and more sports. He has never asked to drive the Indian or M20. He might show up at a Tower Park meet for a half day. He grew up differently from me although he has been exposed to the hobby.\n\nWill he come full circle like I did? Will Jeff answer JAG's call to write an article about how he got his start in the HMV hobby? I hope to be around to read it when he does!", "GENEVA Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Germany's BMW (BMWG.DE) are still keen to develop a common sportscar architecture but have yet to decide on a timeline for the project, a senior executive at the Japanese carmaker said on Monday.\n\nBMW and Toyota have for some years been collaborating on fuel cell technology, lightweight components, and on possibly jointly developing the underpinnings of a sportscar, which would spawn separate vehicles for each brand.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the Geneva auto show, Toyota executive vice president Didier Leroy said all three projects were going very well and there was strong support for the sportscar from both firms.\n\n\"On both sides we have strong motivation to make it successful, we want to make the car,\" Leroy said. \"We know exactly which kind of body we want to do, we know exactly which kind of powertrain we want to use ... now we just have to decide by when we want to start this car.\"\n\nToyota's sales in Europe, which for the carmaker counts 56 countries, including Israel, Russia and Turkey, fell slightly to 874,000 vehicles last year as higher deliveries in the western part of the region failed to offset a sharp drop in Russia.\n\n\"In 2014 we sold 888,000, and we've set ourselves a target of stepping above that (in 2016),\" Toyota's head for Europe Johan van Zyl said at the same event.

Tech-wise, the 2016 340i Sedan features the tried-and-true iDrive infotainment interface, although it also has a shortage of driver-assist tech for a car of its caliber.\n\nHow Much?\n\nWhile the BMW 3 Series comes in many different permutations, including a wagon, the 2016 340i Sedan is available is just two trim levels: rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. The RWD model starts at $45,800, but with almost $15,000 in options and a $995 destination charge, the final sticker price for our test car comes to $60,220.\n\nWhat Does It Come With?\n\nThe 2016 340i Sedan we tested comes with a 3.0-liter twin-turbo 320-horsepower inline 6-cylinder engine and 6-speed manual transmission. Standard features include auto start-stop, Driving Dynamics Control, LED headlights and fog lights, run-flat tires, power-folding and heated side mirrors, 10-way power front sport seats with 2-way power-adjustable side bolsters, driver memory for exterior mirrors and seat positions, keyless entry and starting, a power moon roof, power rear sun shade, ambient lighting, Bluetooth for phone and streaming audio, the iDrive infotainment interface with a center console controller and 8.8-inch center-dash screen, and a 16-speaker/600-watt Harman Kardon Surround Sound Audio System with CD, AM/FM HD Radio, satellite radio, and USB and aux-in ports.\n\nThe long list of options in our test car starts with the $2,750 Technology Package that includes navigation, a head-up display, BMW Online and Apps connectivity, Advanced Real-Time Traffic Information, and Remote Services via a smartphone app. Almost as expensive is the $2,600 M Sport Package, which adds 19-inch wheels, sport seats, M Sport suspension and steering wheel, aerodynamic kit, and special interior trim. The $950 Driver Assistance Package includes a rearview camera and parking sensors, and the $1,750 Driver Assistance Plus package adds top- and side-view cameras, Active Blind Spot Assistance, and Active Driving Assistance that combines lane departure and collision warning. The $800 Cold Weather Package comes with heated front and rear seats and a heated steering wheel. Additional individual options include $550 for Melbourne Red metallic paint, $1,450 for leather upholstery, $575 for manual rear side window shades, and $350 for Enhanced Bluetooth that adds extra phone and connectivity features.\n\nHow's the Tech?\n\nThe 2016 340i Sedan's iDrive infotainment interface consists of the familiar rotary center-console/in-dash screen combo that we've seen in most other BMWs we've tested, and is one of the best of its type. It also has a touchpad on top of the controller that lets you input text characters by tracing them. While we've found that this entry method can be hit or miss, it's usually much faster than inputting the info using the controller's time-consuming turn-and-press method. The iDrive system's 8.8-inch screen presents info like navigation maps very vividly, making it easy to grasp at a glance.\n\nThe BMW 340i's hybrid connectivity brings in cloud-based features including news, weather, and online search information via an embedded SIM card, and accesses more data-intensive services like streaming music from Pandora and Spotify through the BMW Apps platform using a driver's tethered smartphone. As with other BMWs we've tested, the built-in 3G connectivity was noticeably slower than with a connected 4G smartphone.\n\nThe BMW 340i is also a bit short on driver assists for a car at this price and trim level; many of these safety features, such as Active Blind Spot Assistance and even a rearview camera, are extra-cost options.\n\nHow Does It Perform?\n\nThe combination of the quick and effortless acceleration of the twin-turbo 320-horsepower 6-cylinder engine, best-in-class handling, and the smooth and quiet ride make the 2016 BMW 340i Sedan the standout performer in the seg ment. The Driving Dynamics Control features Eco Pro, Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ settings that let you tailor performance to your own driving style. And the 6-speed manual transmission that came with our test car was a delightful surprise, given that few luxury automakers even offer a stick shift these days. One small downside is that the 340i's engine stop-start is one of the most abrupt we've seen, but this fuel-saving feature can be disabled.\n\nShould I Buy It?\n\nWhile the segment is filled with worthy rivals like the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Audi A4, Lexus IS 350, and Cadillac ATS, the BMW 340i Sedan delivers the best of everything we demand in a compact luxury sedan. This easily makes it the segment front runner, both for avowed driving enthusiasts and for shoppers who just prefer a premier luxury car experience.", "GENEVA Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Germany's BMW (BMWG.DE) are still keen to develop a common sportscar architecture but have yet to decide on a timeline for the project, a senior executive at the Japanese carmaker said on Monday.\n\nBMW and Toyota have for some years been collaborating on fuel cell technology, lightweight components, and on possibly jointly developing the underpinnings of a sportscar, which would spawn separate vehicles for each brand.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the Geneva auto show, Toyota executive vice president Didier Leroy said all three projects were going very well and there was strong support for the sportscar from both firms.\n\n\"On both sides we have strong motivation to make it successful, we want to make the car,\" Leroy said. \"We know exactly which kind of body we want to do, we know exactly which kind of powertrain we want to use ... now we just have to decide by when we want to start this car.\"\n\nHe declined to comment on a possible timeframe.\n\nToyota's sales in Europe, which for the carmaker counts 56 countries, including Israel, Russia and Turkey, fell slightly to 874,000 vehicles last year as higher deliveries in the western part of the region failed to offset a sharp drop in Russia.\n\nBut volumes are seen returning to growth in 2016.\n\n\"In 2014 we sold 888,000, and we've set ourselves a target of stepping above that (in 2016),\" Toyota's head for Europe Johan van Zyl said at the same event. He expects overall industry sales in the region to grow by 1 percent this year.\n\nSome 70 percent of Toyota's vehicles sold in Europe last year were produced in the region. The carmaker expects to increase that percentage this year by adding two localized models, the C-HR crossover that will be manufactured in Turkey and the RAV4 that will be assembled in Russia.\n\nVan Zyl said Toyota was committed to the Russian market, despite the challenges there. In 2015, total car industry sales in Russia plunged by 36 percent to 1.6 million.\n\n\"We will not give up on the Russian market ... we will keep on investing to prepare ourselves for when the market recovers,\" he said.\n\nVan Zyl said Toyota expected hybrid vehicles to make up half of its sales in Europe by 2020 from 24 percent last year.\n\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Alison Williams)", "Driving Tesla's Model X: The Future Called... They Want Their Car Back\n\nWhile Tesla Motors officially started delivering the Model X all-electric crossover utility vehicle last September, there are still only a few hundred of the cars in the hands of their customers, mostly in the United States, with several thousand reservations and orders for the car still pending. Tesla has not officially released the exact number of advance reservations for the Model X, but estimates in online forums (based on the reservation numbers reported by forum members over the past four years) run as high as 30,000 or more before accounting for cancellations. For a car that sells for anywhere from $80,000 to $152,000, that's an impressive feat. It should also bring in a hefty amount of income for the company when these reservations convert to confirmed orders, and from there to delivered cars later this year.\n\nHowever, not all of these thousands of reservations have converted to confirmed orders. Apparently some people actually want to see the car in person -- maybe even drive one -- before converting their refundable $5,000 (production) or $40,000 (Signature) deposit into a non-refundable order. \u00c2 But with so few Model X cars available -- and virtually none in Tesla's stores -- getting hands-on with a Model X has been tricky.\n\nTo remedy this situation, Tesla is bringing a fleet of Model X cars around the U.S. and Canada, allowing reservations holders to check out the X in person: play with those unique Falcon Wing Doors, take in the view of the massive panoramic windshield and experience the thrill of a \"Ludicrous Speed\" launch. This event, called \"Meet Model X\" came through Manhattan and Syosset, NY this past week and it gave me a chance to get behind the wheel of this decidedly futuristic car.\n\nAfter a quick tutorial from my Tesla co-pilot, we pulled out of the lot and onto the back street where the Syosset Tesla store is located. We switched the car over to \"Ludicrous Speed\" and I punched that go pedal hard. Wooohooooo! We were pressed back into our seats as the road melted away behind us. It was just as exhilarating as the first time I test drove a Tesla P85+ a few years ago. But the fact that a 6000-pound 7-seat SUV could have the same effect continues to amaze me. Tesla says the Model X P90D with Ludicrous Speed upgrade will do 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, and I have no reason to believe they're wrong. This makes it the quickest production SUV ever made. It even beats many dedicated 2-seater super cars. But it can fit a family of seven plus their gear and also tow a boat or medium-sized trailer (up to 5,000 pounds).\n\nAnd as fast as the Model X is, I never felt that I was not in control. Whether speeding down that deserted street, merging onto the highway, or exiting said highway in a tight curve, the car's low center of gravity and responsive steering made it feel as if we were glued to the road.\n\n\"We Have Assumed Control\"\n\nThe Model X also handled surprisingly well when my hands were off the wheel. While on the highway I tapped the stalk under the steering wheel twice to engage \"Auto-Pilot\" mode. With auto-pilot engaged, the Model X steers for you, keeping you in your lane and also maintains a safe distance from the car in front of you. Its built-in cameras even read speed limit signs and can adjust your speed accordingly, to prevent you from getting any tickets. And this is probably a good thing. Because the ride on the Model X is so smooth that it's easy to break into 3-digit speeds without event trying (ahem, \"from what I've heard\").\n\nBack at the Tesla store, we were able to check out some of the unique features of the Model X. Pressing the keyfob or tapping the rear door handle sets the Falcon Wing Doors in motion. These are different from traditional \"gull wing\" doors in that they have two hinges instead of one. These two independent hinges as well as integrated sensors allow the doors to open even in very tight parking spaces. If the car detects a large object next to it (like another car), the falcon wing doors will change their opening arc to avoid the obstruction, opening up and then outward instead of outward, then up. And if you stand too close to a falcon wing door, it will simply stop, rather than smack you in the face.\n\nOnce the Falcon Wing Doors are open, accessing the third row seat can be done a couple of ways: in a seven-seat configuration, pressing the button on the back of the outer middle seat moves the outer and middle seats in the third row forward and tilts them out of the way allowing passengers to walk right into the rear seat. In a six-seat configuration, you can do the same thing, or you can simply enter the rear seat from the middle row, passing through the space between the two middle seats. Once in the rear row of a seven-seater, things can feel a little tight back there (at least for this 6-foot tall writer) due to the high seat backs of the middle row in front of you and the relatively low headroom. But switching over to a 6-seat configuration opens up the space considerably and also gives rear seat passengers a peak through that massive front windshield as well as some additional leg room. The windshield goes back much further than in a regular car, making it feel almost like you're touring around in a glass-walled helicopter.\n\nThe front doors are also very clever. They detect your approach to the car (or, to be precise, they detect the key fob in your pocket approaching the car) and they open out automatically to allow you to get in. Like the falcon wing doors, the front doors include sensors to avoid contact with people or other objects. Once in the driver's seat, simply tap the brake pedal to close both the driver's and front passenger's doors automatically.\n\n\"These All Go to Eleven\"\n\nWe also checked out the HiFi system (it goes to 11, natch), which comes with such niceties as TuneIn Internet Radio, FM, Slacker, Sirius/XM (upgraded system only) and Pandora. What it lacks is AM radio which we're told is due to the EM interference on the AM band caused by electric motors. BMW's i3 EV lacks the AM band for the same reason. If you're fond of particular AM radio stations for news, sports, weather or traffic, chances are you can find the internet radio streaming versions via TuneIn internet radio and you can plug those in as favorites. The Model X comes with free 4G LTE service in the car for the first four years so you won't have to worry about your internet connection in most areas of the globe where you're likely to drive one. You can also connect the car to your phone's mobile hotspot or your home WiFi for software updates or internet access.\n\nJust for fun, we fired up the \"bioweapon defense\" mode on the climate control system. This mode pumps the cabin air through dual activated carbon filters as well as a HEPA grade particulate filter. It also cranks the fan to eleven (Musk must really like \"Spinal Tap\"). While driving, the whir of the fans wasn't even noticeable though we could hear it when the car was stopped. The system was designed to provide \"hospital grade\" air quality inside, while the air outside may be somewhat less than ideal. This should make the car very popular in China (and certain parts of New Jersey).\n\nReluctantly, I had to say goodbye to the Model X as the next driver in the queue approached. Overall, my hands-on experience with the Model X just reinforced my opinion of this car. It's a glimpse of what cars will be like in the future, but it's available now (or at least, \"soon\" for current reservation holders). If you can afford the price tag, put in your order and you're in for a treat. Depending on which configuration you choose, you could be waiting for a few months or even up to a year. Confirmed orders for the top of the line P90D version are shipping first, followed by the non-performance 90D model, followed by the smaller battery (and lower range) 70D model. Features like the panoramic windshield and falcon wing doors are standard on all models while auto-opening front doors and bioweapon defense mode are optional features. You can check out our complete Model X Buyers Guide for details on options and pricing.\n\nThe \"Meet Model X\" event is still making its way across the country but is currently open to Model X reservation holders only. Tesla expects to have the Model X available in showrooms for the general public to test drive later this year.", "The 2016 Geneva Motor Show kicks off tonight with preview events ahead of the first press day tomorrow - all the action right here live.\n\nThe 2016 Geneva Motor Show gets up and running this evening with a series of pre-show preview events from a selection of the world's biggest brands.

Find out with our interactive timeline. All times are CET so subtract 1 hour for GMT...\n\n* Alfa Romeo Giulietta\n\nAlfa Romeo has hinted at a rear-wheel-drive platform for the next Giulietta - possibly the same one underpinning the Giulia sports saloon. The platform could make the Giulietta a unique proposition in the hatchback market, as we're expecting the next-generation BMW 1 Series to leave behind its rear-drive platform in favour of a front-wheel-drive alternative.\n\n* Alpina B7\n\nAlpina will be bringing along its storming new take on the BMW 7 Series, as previewed in a recent teaser video. It could be powered by a 600bhp-plus V8 from the brand's B5, and may even get four-wheel drive.\n\n* Alpine Vision Concept\n\nRenault's latest project will come from the French manufacturer's new sporty sub-brand - Alpine. The Vision Concept has been officially unveiled and could potentially preview a whole range of cars sold under the Alpine brand.\n\nBritish manufacturer Arash will be bringing more horsepower to the show in one car than most manufacturers will on their entire stand - the AF10 hybrid packs 2,080bhp from its supercharged V8 and electric motor combo.\n\n* Aston Martin DB11\n\nWe already know what the new Aston Martin DB11 looks like, thanks to leaked images, they shows Aston is abandoning the 'cookie cutter' design that's been applied to most of its modern cars. The car will get a brand-new twin-turbo V12, and elements of the interior will be supplied by Mercedes.\n\n* Audi Q2\n\n* Audi RS Q3 Performance\n\nAudi recently aquired the rights to use the Q2 name, and we expect to see it used on the brand's new MQB-based small crossover, set to be revealed in Geneva. It will take on the Nissan Juke, and is based on the same platform as the VW Polo.\n\nThe new Mulsanne has been revealed ahead of a debut at Geneva, and for the first time a long-wheelbase version will be available, providing rear passengers with what Bentley says is 'the most relaxing automotive environment in the world'.\n\nBentley could also bring along a concept version of the Bentayga SUV with coupe-like styling and even more power to the Geneva Motor Show this year. According to a Bentley insider, the car will be more agressively styled and performance-focused, but will still seat four in comfort.\n\n* Bugatti Chiron\n\nBugatti modestly describes the new Chiron as the \"world's most powerful, fastest, most luxurious and most exclusive production super sports car\". It uses a redeveloped 8.0-litre, quad-turbo W16 engine to produce 1,479bhp and 1,600Nm of torque from as little as 2,000rpm. Amazing!\n\n* SpaceTourer MPV\n\n* SpaceTourer HYPHEN concept\n\nCitroen will bring along two variations on the SpaceTourer theme to Geneva. The first is a practical MPV that will take the place of the current Dispatch Combi, and the second is a much more over-the-top concept car named after a pop band.\n\n* DS E-Tense\n\nWhile Citroen offers up its new van-based MPVs, the recently separated PSA luxury brand, DS, has an all-electric GT car dubbed the E-Tense. The 396bhp electric motor has 516Nm of torque and the interior has the flair you'd expect from a show-stopping concept.\n\n* Ferrari GTC4Lusso\n\nThe Ferrari FF is no more, with the GTC4Lusso taking over. It's a mid-life facelift for the car in all but name, so we'll see a power boost for the 6.3-litre V12 as well as a handful of cosmetic changes.\n\nWe've already seen the saloon version, but Fiat could be getting ready to reveal the Tipo hatchback destined for the UK market. The hatch will keep the handsome front-end styling we've already seen on the saloon, and we expect the interior to be very similar too.\n\nFord will have a Vignale focus at the Geneva show, with three new models set to get the brand's posh makeover. The Edge will be the most likely target, being an upmarket car to begin with, and we expect a Kuga Vignale as well.\n\nThe stand is also hosting the new Fiesta ST200 hot hatch. The much-loved Fiesta ST has finally got a power upgrade to 197bhp and promises big fun.\n\n* Honda Civic Concept\n\nThe Honda Civic concept previews the design of the new Civic hatchback and we're told the production car will look very similar to this when it arrives in the UK. The car's shape is similar to the stylish Civic Coupe we saw last year.\n\nHyundai will debut the Ioniq, a rival for the Toyota Prius and the first car to be offered with fully electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrain options in the range. It's aerodynamic too, with a low drag coefficient, which means it will have more pure-electric range than the Nissan Leaf.\n\nJaguar has officially lifted the lid on the new F-Type SVR at the show. Order books are open now for the 200mph+ super-coupe, with prices beginning at \u00a3110,000 for the hardtop coupe and \u00a3115,485 for the convertible.\n\nJeep is set to reveal a rival for the Nissan Qashqai at the show, most likely under the ressurected 'Compass' name. It will slot between the Renegade and Cherokee in the Jeep range, and if the Renegade is anything to go by it could be one of the best off-roaders in its class.\n\nKahn Design has confirmed its Vengeance supercar will have its cover pulled off at Geneva. It's based on an Aston Martin DB9, but adds bespoke bodywork to give it a striking new look, The limited-run model is expected to cost in the region of \u00a3250,000.\n\nLamborghini will celebrate 100 years since its founder's birth at Geneva Motor Show 2016 by launching the Centenario. Only 40 of the cars will be built and all have been sold for a price tag of \u00a31.6million.\n\nLexus' LC Coupe went on show at the Detroit Motor Show, and the brand has unveiled the LC500h, which adds a hybrid powertrain. The flagship two-door comes with a newly developed 'Multi-Stage Hybrid System' pairing a 3.5-litre V6 engine to an electric motor.\n\nMaserati is continuing its charge into the mainstram following the Ghibli saloon with the Levante SUV. Despite being part of the FCA group, which includes Jeep, the company promises that this 4x4 will be 100 per cent Maserati.\n\nThe new Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet has been revealed in Geneva, with the soft-top joining the saloon, estate and coupe to complete the traditional C-Class line-up. It will go on sale in the summer, with prices expected to start from around \u00a337,000.It borrows its sleek design from the C-Class Coupe, with a long rear deck aping the S-Class Cabriolet.\n\nMitsubishi is gearing up for the Geneva Motor Show, with two concept off-roaders aimed at 'urban adventurers'. Named 'GEOSEEK' both the ASX and L200 concept feature sleek roof boxes and orange detailing.\n\nNissan is planning what it says is the future of the petrol station - a wireless charging port for its range of electric cars like the Leaf. We'll hear more at the Geneva show, including a demonstration of how it works - and crucially how long it takes to charge.\n\nPeugeot has revealed its new Traveller MPV at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. It will go on sale later on in the year, and joins the Citroen SpaceTourer which is based on the same platform. It's part of a trio of models that also includes the Toyota Proace, with all three sharing similar slab-sided styling and spacious interior dimensions.\n\nPininfarina has released a very subtle teaser of the concept it's bringing to the motor show. It's almost impossible to tell what it could be - but it could be a striking new sports car design.\n\nThe updated Porsche 718 Boxster has already been revealed, and we'll see it in the metal at the Geneva show. Under the skin is a range of flat-four turbo engines - in an effort to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy. There's still more power than before, though.\n\nJoining it on the Porsche stand is the 911 R, a hardcore road-going model based on the GT3 RS with a 4.0-litre 493bhp engine and a manual gearbox. It should keep the purists happy.\n\nWith the Kadjar crossover and the next-gen Megane on sale, attention is turning to the all-new Scenic MPV. It's set to launch at the show, and features a much more stylish, dynamic design than the old model. If an MPV still isn't for you, Renault is also lifting the lid on the new Megane Sport Tourer estate.\n\nSEAT's first ever SUV will join the brand's lineup just in time for the show, with company bosses saying it will help the brand 'take another leap forward'. The design is clearly based on other SEAT products like the Leon, and it sits on the same platform as the upcoming Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWe've had teasers and official images of it, but now Skoda's 'Vision S' concept SUV has made its debut at the Geneva Motor Show. The six-seat model is expected to go on sale at the start of next year and be called the 'Kodiak'.\n\nAlong with a bigger version of the Tivoli, named the XLV, SsangYong will be bringing a new 'mild hybrid' to the show. Called the SIV-2, it features a 1.5-litre direct injection turbo petrol engine with a 10kW electric motor.\n\nToyota is showing the C-HR - a hybrid crossover which we'll see in the metal for the first time at the show. It looks look much like the previous concept, shown at last years Frankfurt Motor Show but this is the production version designed to tackle the Nissan Juke.\n\nAlso heading to show is the incredibly sensible Proace Verso MPV. It's based on the same platform as its sister 'vans - the Citroen SpaceTourer and Peugeot Traveller.\n\nVauxhall has revealed a new concept coupe called the GT to debut at the Geneva show, with a production model to follow afterwards. The car will rival the Audi TT and feature a range of turbocharged petrol and diesel engines when it finds its way to the showroom.\n\nVauxhall will also be showing the new Mokka X, an updated version of the existing Mokka crossover.\n\nThe Tiguan family is set to grow - literally, with the addition of a seven-seat Tiguan XL. Volkswagen also plan to expand into the growing coupe-SUV category with a new entry, called the T-Cross. Volkswagen says the new T-Cross will be very sporty, with an exciting design.\n\nThe company is also finally bringing its experience with turbocharged engines to the baby of the range with the facelifted up!. Along with subtle visual tweaks, the up! will have the addition of a 1.0-litre TSI engine providing 89bhp. And a new luxury saloon aimed at the Chinese market called the Phideon is also on the stand.\n\nWe've already been impressed by the new S90, and Volvo will be hoping the upcoming V90 estate does the same when it's revealed in Geneva. It'll get a similar front-end to the saloon, with a spacious tailgate on the back.\n\nVolvo is also be showing off a mid-life facelift for the V40 hatchback. Changes are minimal, but the 'Thor's Hammer' headlight arrangement from the XC90 and S90 features.\n\nClick here for all the latest pics from this year's show...\n\nIf you fancy hopping over to Geneva to sample the bright lights and shinny metal of the world's premier car show first hand, it's a lot easier than you might think. Tickets for Geneva Motor Show's public dates are a very reasonable \u00a311 for adults or \u00a36 for Children and there's a 50% discount if you turn up after 4pm. The opening hours are 10 am to 8 pm on weekdays and 9am to 7pm on the weekend and you can buy tickets online here.\n\nTake a cheap flight or a road trip over to the Swiss capital and you could even combine some slack-jawed gawping at the Geneva Motor Show's amazing cars with a spot of skiing!", "Diesel-powered X6 M50d gets a boost up to 455bhp as well as some visual 'upgrades' courtesy of Hamann\n\nGerman tuner Hamann is known for coaxing extra power from standard engines - especially BMW ones. Now the firm has turned its expertise to the BMW X6 and will show off the upgrades at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThe big news is the upgrades Hamann has made to the engine of the X6. The M50d model on which this tuned version is based was never exactly a shrinking violet thanks to its triple-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six diesel unit, but Hamann has upgraded this with an extra 79bhp and an extra 150Nm of torque, bringing the figures up from 376bhp and 740Nm to a massive 455bhp and 890Nm.\n\n* Best diesel cars\n\nThe company hasn't told us how much extra speed the power boost brings with it, but as the standard car can go from 0-62mph in just 5.3 seconds it's not a big leap to expect a sub-5-second time from this two-tonne-plus SUV.\n\nThere have been visual upgrades, too. The upgraded black bonnet is actually made entirely of carbon fibre and weighs just 10.5kg, while the 23\" wheels are also special lightweight models. That's not all though - it's difficult not to notice the overblown body kit, which adds an extra 12cm of width to the already massive X6. A low front skirt incorporates fibre-optic daytime running lights, while the rear splitter contains quad exhausts sat underneath a carbon-fibre-tipped boot spoiler. Those exhausts can even be ceramic-coated should you want a more individual look. Subtle this X6 is not.\n\nNeed to make more of an entrance? Diesel it may be, but an 'Active Sound System' ensures that the 3.0-litre straight-six will sound like a petrol V8. The noise can even be tailored to your own personal preference through the Hamann app so you can vary the engine roar that you wake the neighbours up with every morning.\n\nHamann hasn't given any prices for these upgrades to the X6 M50d, but the car is available to buy now.", "BMW Australia has announced that an autonomous self-parking feature will be available on Australian delivered 7 Series vehicles by the end of 2016.\n\nThe feature, which is currently available on the new BMW 7 Series vehicles overseas, was disabled locally due to government legislation that requires an occupant to be in the car while it is being operated.\n\n\"We do have a self parking feature on the 7 Series and it's something that is available in overseas markets and...and it will be this year [available locally],\" said general manager of corporate communications, Lenore Fletcher.\n\n\"It's going to be in the second half, possibly late in the third quarter [of 2016] that we're going to see that product here.\"\n\nFletcher said that the company has been working closely with the government and legislative authorities to get the technology across the line. The Tesla Model S has a similar feature, which was activated recently in Australia after an over-the-air software update.\n\n\"With all the technology we see coming in, it's something the legislative bodies are aware of, we have great relationships with different departments and it's something that we're in constant conversation with. With everything that comes in it presents challenges for this legislation and requirements of the Australian government.\"\n\nThe parking feature allows the driver to stand outside the vehicle while it parks itself in a parking space or garage. The driver operates the parking procedure via the smart key and is able to stop the process at any time. The vehicle has built in systems and countless sensors to also monitor the parking procedure.\n\nUnfortunately for early buyers of the new BMW 7 Series, the system cannot be fitted retrospectively.", "REUTERS/StringerExpensive shoes.\n\nAbout 30 years ago, I was able to predict the U.S. would see a major generational spending peak in 2007, all from my demographic indicator, the Generational Spending Wave.\n\nOn a 46-year lag from the time they were born, that's when the peak number of baby boomers would peak in spending for the average household.\n\nAfter that, they would slow in spending, ultimately sending the economy over a \"demographic cliff.\" Remember, 70% of the economy relies on consumer spending! When it slows, everything falls with it.\n\nThis first demographic cliff happened right on cue, and it helped carry the world into a financial crisis that we've still never really recovered from despite unprecedented government stimulus.\n\nBut now, there is a second demographic cliff that I've been forecasting which appears to be happening in spades, and globally - not just in the U.S. and China.\n\nWhile the peak number of baby boomers peaked in spending in 2007, the more affluent - the top 10% to 20% - didn't peak until late last year, 2015. In other words, up until now their spending has still been driving the economy. Going forward, that will be less and less the case.\n\nThis group peaked eight years later simply because they tend to go to school longer and have kids later. They peak on about a 54-year lag, not 46 like the peak number of boomers.\n\nDon't underestimate this group. We're talking about the spending of the top 10% to 20% during a period of the highest income and wealth inequality since 1928 to 1929. They account for around 50% of income and spending. That gives them much more weight. And that means that as they cut back their spending as they're already starting to, it'll carve out a hole in the economy that'll really kick off this global crash.\n\nLook at the S&P Global Luxury Index, which gives you an indication as to how this group is spending:\n\nEconomy & Markets\n\nThis index peaked in mid-2015 and has fallen 26% as of February 11. It's down much more than the broad S&P 500, down about 15% at worst recently from its high in May 2015.\n\nThis is not a coincidence. This is basically an index for affluent spending, and it peaked in the same year this group peaked.\n\nThe index includes iconic brands like Nike, Estee Lauder, Mercedes, Moet Vuitton, BMW, Carnival Cruises and VF Corporation. But there are many leading brands that have also seen their stocks collapse in recent months or years.\n\nNordstrom, a brand we all know, is down 36% since last March...\n\nClearly, the affluent sector is falling! They have benefited the most from zero interest rate policies and this artificial bubble and \"recovery,\" but it's now starting to break down.\n\nThis is another monumental change in demographic trends and the final death knell for the economy. If the Fed thought it could fight the demographic decline and debt crisis since 2007 with endless QE and stimulus, I want to see them fight this trend. There's no way. Game over!\n\nAnd guess who will lose the most wealth in this next, larger crash? The very group I'm talking about. The top 0.1%, 1%, 10%, and 20%, because they own almost all of the financial assets that have been favored in this bubble period with endless QE and zero interest rates. Worse, it'll be years before they see another great boom - not until late 2022-forward. And it won't be like the one we saw from 1983 to 2000.\n\nNow is the time to protect your wealth on this final, desperate rally before stocks see a more serious crash in the year to follow.\n\nRead the original article on Economy & Markets.

The Houston Opera has offered free season tickets to patrons who lost their jobs in the oil bust. A fancy restaurant offers cut-price dinners.\n\nThere's one place where OPEC can't broker an oil deal: The fracking heartland of Texas\n\nSaudi Arabia and Russia have taken the first step to stem the slide in oil prices. There's just one problem: If they are successful -- and that's a big if -- the wildcatters of Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota are waiting to pounce.\n\nContinue reading.\n\nTwenty months into the worst oil price crash since the 1980s, well-heeled residents of the world's oil capital are among the hardest hit largely because tanking energy firm shares make up much of oil and gas executives' compensation.\n\nIn River Oaks, a neighbourhood of palatial mansions and lush gardens, the average sales price of a home has tumbled to US$1.3 million from US$2 million in the middle of 2014 when oil began its more than 70 per cent slide, according to data from the Houston Association of Realtors and Keller Williams. Median property prices in the area have already fallen further in this downturn, which is not yet over, than the 16 per cent drop in the previous oil slump in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\"When oil does well, River Oaks does well. When oil does bad River Oaks does bad,\" said Paige Martin, a Keller Williams broker who specializes in the neighborhood. \"Not everybody can afford a US$10 million house.\"\n\nCity-wide data also show that while overall sales of single family homes fell 2 per cent in January, sales of those priced over US$500,000 tumbled 9 per cent. The overall median house price was US$200,000, up 5 per cent on the year, according to the realtors' association.\n\nWhile Houston's economy is far more diversified now than in the 1980s when the city lost 13 per cent of its jobs, it remains home to 5,000 energy-related firms and the fortunes of oil and gas executives are tied more than ever to the energy market.\n\nSince U.S. lawmakers passed a law in 1992 encouraging \"performance-based\" pay, the share of stock options in executive compensation has steadily increased, said David Bixby, head of the Houston office for Pearl Meyer compensation consultants.\n\n\"Now, you're looking at 70 to 80 per cent of CEO compensation in stock on average for oil and gas companies,\" he said. \"They are going to be exposed to commodity price cycles.\"\n\nRelated ACROBATS AND FOR SALE SIGN\n\nFor example, former oil executive, Kolja Rockov, whose extravagant wedding with dancers and acrobats became a local online sensation three years ago, briefly put his unfinished mansion on the market for US$6.9 million, according to listings.\n\nA Jan. 21, 2015 SEC filing showed he involuntarily sold 239,000 shares of the company's tanking stock he had used as a collateral for a loan. Rockov lost his job as Linn Energy LLC's CFO in August.\n\nRockov said the house is actively under construction, isn't for sale, and that he left his job by mutual consent. A Nov. 5 SEC filing said he was \"terminated without cause.\"\n\nLuxury car sales are also slower in Houston than in other parts of the state and the country.\n\n\"If you're working for an energy company, you see all this stress around you, it might nick your purchase confidence, even if you are fairly high income,\" Earl Hesterberg, chief executive of Houston-based Group 1 Automotive Inc, told Reuters.\n\nHe said excess inventory was most acute for top line BMW and Mercedes-Benz models in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nIn a nod to the downturn, Ouisie's Table, a River Oaks institution, is now offering its \"Oil Barrel Bargain,\" a three course dinner for the price of a barrel of oil, now around US$30.\n\nTo be sure, oil executives are not alone in feeling the pain. Many blue collar jobs in oilfield equipment production have disappeared. So have thousands of middle management jobs in oil exploration and production. A regular Uber customer is likely at some point to ride with a former energy industry professional.\n\n\"It pays for the mortgage,\" said Matthew Clemonds, who once did mapping for pipeline companies and now works for the ride-sharing company.\n\nJob growth has slowed to a crawl from the breakneck pace of 100,000 a year during the oil boom; housing starts are down and subleasing of new office space is rising, according to government data and NAI Partners, a real estate consultancy.\n\nBut so far, owing to its diversity, the metropolitan economy has shown remarkable resilience, adding 20,000 jobs to just over 3 million last year.\n\nFor example, Houston is home to the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest cluster of hospitals, research facilities and affiliated universities, which says it employs 106,000.\n\nIn the energy sector, about US$50 billion being invested in new petrochemical plants to take advantage of cheap supplies is helping offset upstream job losses.\n\n\"This is the best oil price downturn we have ever had,\" said Ted Jones, chief economist at Stewart Title Guaranty Company. \"We still have more jobs than we have ever had in history.\"\n\nBill Gilmer, a University of Houston economist, says so far it has paid off to tough it out through oil's booms and busts and notes that ever since 1969 Houston has consistently ranked among the fastest growing U.S. cities.\n\n\"The only problem is that it can be a rollercoaster.\"\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2016", "The BMW 2 Series might be the purest driver's car in the BMW stable. What do you need to know before you buy a 2 Series? Don't worry, we'll tell you everything right here in the Ultimate Buyer's Guide.\n\nThe 2 Series is the latest version of the kind of car that made anybody care about BMWs at all (other than bubble-car enthusiasts): small two-door sedans/coup\u00e9s that make you want to thank Motor Jesus that you know how to drive.\n\nThe 2 Series is the replacement for the 1 Series, the former smallest BMW that was the rebirth of the venerable 2002 and closest spiritual heir to the popular E30 3 Series of the 1980s. The good news is that the 2 doesn't fall prey to the usual fate of replacements coming in too big, too heavy, and missing the point. Yes, the 2 is bigger and heavier than the old 1, but it still completely on message. That message is, of course, driving is great.\n\nIt's big enough to be a practical daily driver, and not a wasted bit bigger. It starts at $32,850, so it's not even all that expensive.\n\nThe 2 Series is one of those rare cars that was designed more for the process of driving than the result, and you feel the results of that fundamental decision in everything you do in the car. The steering is one of the best electronically-assisted setups we've driven, responsive and with a good amount of feedback from the road. The car is balanced and feels just right, in that deep, pit of your groin sort of way. It's an old-school RWD sports coup\u00e9 made with modern stuff.\n\nThe turbo inline six has more power, sure, and more is fun, but the heavier motor does tweak the balance just a bit. We feel like the four is all most people will need, as it's a great engine with a surprising punch.\n\nThe automatic does a remarkably good job in these cars, and can let you focus more on other parts of driving, but we really prefer the manual, which is an extremely satisfying six speed. The auto can do everything quicker and better than you can, but why give the robots all the fun?\n\nBMW took the wraps off its new 2 Series a few months before the 2014 Detroit Auto Show. They showed the world, essentially, a new 1 Series M Coupe. That's a great thing, because the 1 Series M Coupe was a great back-to-basics BMW.\n\nThat new 2014 2 Series, like the 1 Series M Coupe, was small, lightweight, came with a stick shift and beautifully balanced. Add to that the fact that it was relatively inexpensive, and the 2 Series might be the enthusiast's choice BMW in their lineup.\n\nIn 2015, BMW made all-wheel drive available on 228i coupe and convertible models as well as on the M235i coupe. The following year, 2016, the M235i convertible also got the chance to route its power to all four wheels, and the M2 made its debut.\n\nPowertrain options are essentially the same as what you find in a 3 Series, 4 Series, X3 or X4: a 2.0-liter turbo I4 and a 3.0-liter turbo I6.\n\nThat 2.0-liter, like in the aforementioned applications, puts out 240 horsepower, while the 3.0-liter makes 320 horses in M235i form or -- thanks to unique pistons, main bearing shells, turbocharger, exhaust manifold and oil sump -- 365 ponies when in the M2.\n\nThe base 228i coupe, M235i coupe or M235i convertible are all available with either a six-speed manual or eight-speed auto, while convertible 228i, xDrive 228i or xDrive M235i models come only with eight-speed automatics.\n\nThe M2 comes gets either a six-speed manual with rev matching or a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic.\n\nAcceleration times are brisk across the board, with the 228i convertible bringing up the rear with a 0-60 mph time of 5.7 seconds. The all-wheel 228i xDrive Convertible gets there a tick faster.\n\nThrow a roof on the 228i and those numbers improve. The manual 228i shoots to 60 in 5.5 seconds, and the auto gets there in 5.4. Add all-wheel drive, and the number improves a tick to 5.3 seconds.\n\nThings drop into the fours with the inline six. Okay, so the convertible manual M235i takes five seconds to get to 60, but the auto gets there in 4.8 ticks in two-wheel drive or 4.7 seconds in xDrive form. The coupe M235i manual does the deed in 4.8 seconds, the auto gets there in 4.6 and the xDrive auto scorches to 60 in 4.4 seconds.\n\nThe manual M2 accelerates to 60 just as quickly as the M235i xDrive Coupe, but tick the automatic box and that seven-speed dual-clutch auto will bring the 0-60 time all the way down to 4.2 ticks.\n\nFuel economy numbers are about the same as those of the BMW 4 Series with the same powertrains. The 2.0-liter will score in the mid 30s on the highway and 27 combined, while the 3.0-liter will roll along the highway making 28 MPG and up to 24 combined.\n\nAll-wheel drive doesn't seem to affect fuel economy significantly, though the manual transmission does, particularly on 3.0-liter models.\n\nNo fuel economy information for the M2 is available yet, but expect it to be in the high 20s on the highway and in the low 20s combined.\n\nThe BMW 2 Series comes in three main trims: 228i, M235i and M2. The former two can be had with all-wheel drive, convertible tops or both. The M2 comes only in rear-drive coupe form.\n\nSteering for all 2ers is electric and suspension is a five-link independent design in the rear and double pivot strut type up front. Brakes for the 228i are 12.3-inch vented rotors in the front and 11.4-inch vented discs out back. M235i models replace those front discs with bigger 13.4-inch plates, while the M2 gets 15-inchers in the front clamped by four-piston calipers and 14.5-inchers out back clamped by two-piston calipers.\n\nWe think the sweet spot of the 2 line is the basement. It's hard to argue with a 228i with the manual, the slightly better sound system, and that's pretty much it. That was basically the Jalopnik-spec one we took across country, slept in, and even peed in. It was a car we drove for a week straight and didn't get bored with.\n\nSure, you could get the six, you could get more toys, you could get an auto, but what's the point? Save your money for good food and beer and enjoy the primal, base joy of the closest thing you can get to an old-school, back to the core of what makes driving great small BMW.\n\nBut if you're gonna go big, the M2 seems like it may be the best car to wear that badge in a generation. Buy one, humiliate M3 owners at the track, feel good about yourself every day.", "Even though it's probably the coolest looking BMW ever made, the i8 has no bright colors on offer, just black, white, blue and silver. That makes it look like an iPhone, which is great if you want people to know it's electric. But if you want a hot color that Ferrari owners will be envious of, look no further than the i8 Protonic Red Edition.\n\nThis bad boy was presented in mid-February and is grabbing even more attention at the Geneva Motor Show. The shade of red BMW used was chosen specially for this car and fits the i8 well. It makes us wonder why nobody asked the company to offer a brighter color... except the hundreds of people who had it wrapped.\n\nThe red paint is made to stand out by applying Frozen Gray to all the trim and Orbit Gray to alloy wheels. The same kinds of colors can also be seen in the interior department, which was also dull and iPhone-like. We see red double-stitching around the cabin and the addition of some carbon fiber and ceramic trim.\n\nThe Protonic Red doesn't inspire you to write a 20-page editorial about the history of the BMW brand. However, it marks the beginning of a new era for the i8, which never had any special editions until now. Pretty soon, we should be inundated with M Performance carbon fiber parts, different trim pieces and even ways to change the face of the vehicle.\n\nSpecial edition models usually start coming out when sales decline. However, sales of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 in 2015 were around 66% up on the previous year with a total of 29,513 deliveries. In the case of the i8, the company cannot keep up with demand.\n\nThe bad news is that the i8 Protonic Red Edition is designed for the UK market, where it will be sold for \u00a3112,535, making it \u00a38995 more than the standard i8. Orders can be placed as early as March 1st, but deliveries will take until August or September.", "We recently saw a review, from Top Gear, of the brand-new BMW M3 Competition Package. According to Top Gear, the Competition Package added massive improvements for ...\n\nWe recently saw a review, from Top Gear, of the brand-new BMW M3 Competition Package. According to Top Gear, the Competition Package added massive improvements for little money, making it a must-have package for the M3/M4. Now, we take a look at a new video review of the BMW M4 Competition Package from Auto Express and the outcome is much the same.\n\nSteve Sutcliffe, the reviewer in this video, had lukewarm feelings about the BMW M4 in the past, feeling that it wasn't up to snuff with its current rivals, like the Porsche Cayman. However, he seems to be quite pleased with the M4 Competition Pack, though. The new bits that the Comp Pack adds are new springs, new bushings, revised suspension tuning, lightweight seats, a new sports exhaust system, some blacked out body bits and a revised electronic M differential. All of this adds up to make the M4 a much sharper overall package, one that is much more progressive feeling and easier to slide about. It just feels more dynamic, apparently.\n\nOn top of the added chassis bits, the Competition Package also adds a bit more power, to the tune of 444 hp, up from the standard car's 425, but it doesn't make the car much lighter. So performance is pretty much the same, except for BMW claims that the Comp Pack makes the M4 a tenth of a second faster to 60 mph. However, Sutcliffe claims that it feels a bit sharper and more enthusiastic at the top of the rev range than before, which is ultimately a good thing as many felt that the M4's engine seemed to die off when nearing redline.\n\nAdmittedly, the stiffened ride that comes with the Comp Pack isn't all that welcome, considering that the M4 already rode quite stiffly, but it doesn't seem too bad if you keep it in comfort on the road. However, significant wind and tire noise are present in the video, something unbecoming of a BMW at that price range. This is largely due to the new large 20'' wheels and wider, harder tires. But the stiffer ride is a minor quibble for an overall excellent package which turns the M4 into a much sharper and much more enjoyable car. Sutcliffe claims, and we can't disagree, that, with the Competition Package, the BMW M4 is possibly the best sports car for the money.", "Two suspects who police say robbed the Apple Bin Shell store at 37th Avenue and Nob Hill Saturday night misplaced keys to the getaway car and had to go back inside the store to find the keys. Police spokesman Mike Bastinelli says that's when one of the suspects pulled off his mask and was recorded by video. \"We've got great pictures. The system in the store was high quality so we have a pretty good picture of the male suspect.\" The male and female suspects eventually found the keys and fled the store in a silver 2000 4 door BMW with tinted headlights. Police are searching for the two suspects today.", "The 2016 Geneva Motor Show inches nearer by the day, an event we're most looking forward to, as it will debut many fantastic new automobiles. ...\n\nThe 2016 Geneva Motor Show inches nearer by the day, an event we're most looking forward to, as it will debut many fantastic new automobiles. Many of which will come from BMW, many of which will not. It's going to be an exciting event as an influx of new vehicles and technologies will finally be revealed to the public. BMW is going to make quite a large splash, though, and we're excited to see its new vehicles in the flesh. So let's take a look at what BMWs we're excited to see in Geneva.\n\nBMW's iPerformance - BMW's newly dubbed iPerformance name will be slapped onto all new BMW EVs and plug-in hybrids going forward. The iPerformance moniker received a lukewarm reception, to be kind, and is mainly just a marketing technique. However, it is a clever one. BMW's i Division is one of the hottest subdivisions on the market and the \"i\" name carries quite a bit of weight to it. The BMW i3 and i8 have been shattering preconceptions of what electric and hybrid vehicles are supposed to be, all while raking in award after award. So, needless to say, the i Division has become quite prestigious. Just like BMW adding the M Division's famous logo on the back of the M235i helped 2 Series sales, putting iPerformance on hybrid and EV models going forward will certainly build a strong influx of sales from customers who want the latest from BMW's famous i Division. So while many fans might find iPerformance to be a bit gimmicky, which one would have difficulty arguing, it will be important to BMW moving forward.\n\nBMW i8 Protonic Red - BMW showed us a special edition of its now-famous i8 plug-in hybrid supercar, the BMW i8 Protonic Red Edition. It's essentially an i8 with some fancy red paint and isn't actually any more extraordinary than the standard car. However, it does mark the beginning of a trend for future special edition iterations of the BMW i8. While this may not sound that important to many enthusiasts, as making an extremely exclusive version of an already extremely exclusive car doesn't sound that appealing to most BMW fans, they are very cool to see. The Protonic Red i8 is just the beginning of some very cool cars to come.\n\nBMW M3/M4 Competition Package - This is where things start to get really juicy for the Bavarians. We already spoke about how the Competition Package that transforms the M3/M4 from a great sports car to an incredible one, with only subtly tweaks. The Comp Pack brings new springs, bushings, a new sports exhaust, wicked looking wheels and a newly tuned electronic diff. None of these are groundbreaking by themselves, but when added all up, the M3/M4 becomes simply epic. And the Comp Pack doesn't even cost that much. At $5,500, the Comp Pack is almost $3,000 cheaper than the carbon ceramic brake option, making it the steal of the year for BMW. Not to mention it looks deliciously sinister.\n\nBMW M760Li - The idea of a BMW M7 has captivated the minds of BMW fans for what seems like decades. While an M7 isn't the most rational of BMWs, it's something that fans have wanted because the idea of a massive luxury car that also has the power and performance of the M Division is oddly titillating. So when BMW finally announced the M760Li, despite it not being a full-blown M car, fans were very happy, indeed. The BMW M760Li's monster twin-turbocharged V12, incredibly luxurious interior, dynamite looks and massive performance potential make this one of the more exciting BMW's of the year. It's up there with the BMW M2 for best new BMW. We've seen pictures of it and read the specs, but there's nothing like seeing it in the flesh and that's something we're very much looking forward to.", "Less than two weeks ago, BMWBLOG headed to Laguna Seca to test drive the new BMW M2. Our M2 coverage can be found here and our driving impressions can be accessed through this link. The driving event consisted of two parts - a morning track session where we had the chance to experience the driving dynamics of the M2 on the famous Laguna Seca and its corkscrew, and a second afternoon session where we took the M2 for three-hour trip along the Pacific Coast Highway and around the hills surrounding Carmel Valley, and towards Big Sur.\n\nAs we've said in our written review, overall, the BMW M2 is an amazing car. It's very fast, far faster than anyone will ever need on the street, has incredible performance and is possibly the most fun car to wear a blue and white roundel. It's also the most fun BMW since the 1 Series M. The BMW M2 does an impressive job of walking the line between being thrilling and safe. It will allow you to have fun and be aggressive, but it's safe enough to not let you kill yourself. It may not be the BMW 1M, but then again it's not supposed to be.\n\nThe M2 will live on its own and it will set the bar high for future generations M2.\n\nThe footage below gives you a closer look at how the M2 handles on the track - with the afferent commentary - and also you have the chance to see the compact sportscar during street driving.", "Mercedes-Benz's ever-broadening lineup will now include a shapely four-seat convertible based on the brand's previously revealed C-Class Coupe. Debuting tomorrow at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show and set to go on sale later this year as a 2017 model, the new C-Class Cabriolet marks the three-pointed star's first true foray into the compact convertible segment.\n\nInstead of a complex and heavy folding metal roof like the rivaling BMW 4-Series, or even Mercedes' recently-unveiled SLC roadster, the C-Class Cabriolet uses a lined cloth roof. Available in a choice of four colors, the roof can be opened or closed in under 20 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph.\n\nAnchoring the entry-level end of the lineup is the C300 Cabriolet, powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder rated at 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Both rear and 4Matic all-wheel-drive variants will be available. For more sporting-minded drivers, the Mercedes-AMG C43 Cabriolet (the C43 Coupe also debuts in Geneva), available exclusively with 4Matic, includes a 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 rated at 362 hp and 384 lb ft of torque. Regardless of engine or drive wheels, all C-Class Cabriolets offered in the United States will come with the brand's 9G Tronic nine-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nMercedes says that the C300 will sprint from a stop to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, while the C43 does the deed in a fleet 4.7 seconds.\n\nDON'T MISS: Feisty Lexus compares RC 350 to BMW'S 435i\n\nSetting the C43 apart from its comparatively pedestrian sibling is an AMG-tuned suspension and a more rear-biased 4Matic system that distributes power in a 31/69 percent front/rear split under normal circumstances. Uprated brakes to tame the extra power and numerous styling cues inside and out further highlight the AMG-tuned C43.\n\nWhile pricing hasn't been announced, equipment levels will be higher than on an equivalent C-Class sedan. Standard features for both models include the company's Airscarf system, which pumps warm air into the front seat passengers' necks, a proximity key, heated front seats, and a 7-inch tablet-style color display.\n\nLook for the C300 Cabriolet to hit dealer lots by summer's end, and for the C43 Cabriolet to arrive a couple of months later.", "Police released video surveillance of two suspects running away from the scene toward Scarlettwoods Court.

The handsome new droptop was shown in both basic C300 form, as well as a more potent C43 AMG model.\n\nNo surprises here, but we're most interested in the Mercedes-AMG C43. Like the sedan and coupe, it takes advantage of a 3.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V6. 362 horsepower and 384 pound-feet of torque will allow it to scoot to 60 in just 4.7 seconds, which is a big improvement on BMW's closest analog, the 435i Convertible (5.4 seconds). Surprisingly, it also is much quicker than the Audi S5 Cabriolet, which takes 5.3 seconds. The top speed is limited to 155 miles per hour.\n\nThe C300 Cabriolet is also something of a known quantity, coming up with 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder making 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Those figures are identical to the C300 sedan, although we're not surprised to see a small drop in straight-line speed. The droptop model takes a tenth of a second longer to get to 60, at 6.3 seconds to the sedan's 6.2.\n\nRegardless of powerplant, there are some significant similarities between these two. Both will be offered with a new nine-speed automatic transmission, while the sedan model is limited to seven forward gears. And that canvas roof? It can be raised or lowered in 20 seconds and at speeds of up to 31 miles per hour.\n\nWhile it seems like convertibles always launch in the darkest depths of winter, Mercedes is doing things right and bringing the C300 Cabriolet to market in both rear-wheel-drive and 4Matic varieties by late summer.

According to the investigation, Brumbles' insurance policy on his 2011 Ford F-150 was canceled for nonpayment in April 2014. Brumbles called State Farm insurance to reinstate his policy on April 14 and then filed a claim moments after reinstating his insurance, saying he rear-ended another vehicle. The metadata on the collision photos showed they were taken a few minutes before Brumbles reinstated his auto insurance. Brumbles filed a claim for more than $6,000 in damage to his truck and more than $670 in damage to the vehicle he hit.\n\nAndrew Borneman, 34, of Puyallup, was charged with one count of filing a false insurance claim and one count of attempted first-degree theft. According to the investigation, Borneman was driving his uninsured 1972 Chevrolet truck in August 2014 when he hit two parked vehicles. Shortly after the collision, Borneman's wife bought an insurance policy for the Chevy truck. A few hours later, Borneman filed a claim for nearly $16,000 in damage to the first vehicle he hit and nearly $3,600 in damage to the second vehicle he hit.

There are plenty of warning signs. Tighter emissions laws are killing big-displacement engines; speed cameras and radar guns threaten our proclivity for driving quickly; fewer young\u00adsters today learn to drive or even buy cars; and self-driving vehicles are real.\n\nBut it isn't time to panic just yet, because Mazda's MX-5 Miata and Volkswagen's Golf GTI are alive and better than ever. No other vehicles have exemplified our \"No Boring Cars\" mantra as consistently during the past three decades, earning spots as some of Automobile's most-awarded, best-reviewed cars in our history.\n\nTheir story arcs are simple: Mazda wanted to revive the best parts of classic British roadsters, and the Miata became an enthusiast darling upon its 1989 debut for its responsive rear-wheel-drive chassis and top-down experience. The formula remains uncorrupted, with this version keeping the naturally aspirated engine, manual gearbox, and simple fabric roof that made us fall for the original.\n\nVolkswagen's Golf GTI, born overseas decades ago, immigrated to the U.S. in 1983 as the Rabbit GTI. Other sport compacts we enjoy owe their legacy to the success of VW's innovative recipe: Take an ordinary family hatchback, make it sportier, and sell it at a reasonable price. Voil\u00e0, you have a car that does it all.\n\nKeeping the Flame\n\nBuilt in 1957, Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca boasts a far more storied past than the Miata and GTI. Editor-in-chief Mike Floyd hops into the Four Seasons 2015 GTI fitted with the performance package upgrade, I grab the keys to our Four Seasons 2016 MX-5 Miata Club, flip open the top, and roll down the pit lane. The fourth-generation Miata retains all of the original's eagerness and charm. Its rev-happy engine jumps to attention and pulls harder than in any previous incarnation. Every millimeter of the tachometer gets a workout as the Mazda climbs up Rahal Straight toward the\n\nfamous Corkscrew.\n\nUpgraded Club suspension and Brembo brakes notwithstanding, this car isn't fast -- as evidenced when senior editor Chris Nelson passes the Miata repeatedly in an Alfa Romeo 4C Spider. Yet I have so much fun on each lap that I don't care. The Miata is a darling playmate that never surprises me, no matter how clumsy my corner entries.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the paddock, Floyd has only praise for the GTI.\n\n\"It's just great,\" he gushes. \"It's fast, and you can even get a little drift going through Turn 3.\"\n\nLapping the GTI after a stint in the Miata is a night-and-day difference. There's much more torque available from its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, and a tendency to understeer forces patience in slow corners. But just like the Mazda, the Volkswagen beats most in the smiles-generated department.\n\nCall it track driving for dummies. The car chides rather than punishes when you accelerate too early or brake too late, shrieking its tires in warning but never getting out of sorts. The steering loads up to indicate what the front tires are doing, the manual transmission's throws are light enough for two-fingered shifting, and the brake pedal reassures with its heft.\n\nOur on-track thrashing continues all afternoon, and neither engines nor brakes overheat. The durability impresses us: Capable as they are, these are first and foremost road cars designed to take the long way home.\n\nThe Real World\n\nA day later, we follow a Monterey-to-Los Angeles route with as few straight lines as possible. Cars roll as daylight's first fingers stretch over the horizon, dashing down U.S. Highway 101 toward the sinewy Route 198 farther inland. Neither the Mazda nor VW contorts us into uncomfortable seats, punishes us over bumps, or gives us tinnitus with droning engines. Everything just works. We drive all day long and emerge from cockpits unruffled, marveling at how much fun these cars provide on the deserted roads we encounter. During this particular flirtation we chased each other with the enthusiasm of Labrador puppies -- and because both cars communicate with their drivers so clearly at any speed, we didn't need to do 100 mph or even 70 mph to find thrills.\n\nOther gold standards, including BMW's M3 and Porsche's 911, are beyond most drivers' budgets. Stalwarts such as Chevrolet's Corvette have struggled through occasional eras of malaise. But the Miata and GTI have never let us down. They force few compromises upon their owners. The Miata won hearts and minds by requiring just a fraction of the maintenance of high-strung European sports cars and by making long journeys easy with its supportive seats and fine ride. The GTI excels at everything, whether commuting, schlepping families, performing daylong road trips, or ripping through back roads with abandon. (To be fair, we concede that the GTI hasn't exactly been maintenance free for some owners.)\n\nCertainly each has grown up over the decades: The Miata now offers navigation and blind-spot warnings, and the GTI's trip computer displays patronizing eco tips like, \"Do not depress accelerator when stationary.\" In terms of practicality, these are easily the best GTI and Miata yet: safer, better-equipped, faster, roomier, and filled with more features than ever.\n\nStill, the roadster and hot hatch entice as much now as they did so many years ago. We applaud them time and again for their essential goodness and back-to-basics fun. Those people who hate driving or speak with animated anticipation about the eventual arrival of fully autonomous vehicles? They haven't piloted a GTI or Miata. We'll savor driving them ourselves for as long as we can.\n\n2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI S with Performance Pack Specifications On Sale: Now Price: $27,700/$28,895\n\n(base/as tested) Engine: 2.0L turbo DOHC 16-valve I-4/220 hp @ 4,500 rpm, 258 lb-ft @ 1,500 rpm Transmission: 6-speed manual Layout: 4-door, 5-passenger, front-engine,\n\nFWD hatchback EPA Mileage: 25/34 mpg (city/hwy) L x W x H: 168 x 70.8 x 56.8 in Wheelbase: 103.6 in Weight: 3,031 lb 0-60 MPH: 5.8 sec Top Speed: 155 mph\n\n2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club Specifications On Sale: Now Price: $29,420/$32,820 (base/as tested) Engine: 2.0L\n\nDOHC 16-valve I-4/\n\n155 hp @ 6,000 rpm, 148 lb-ft @ 4,600 rpm Transmission: 6-speed manual Layout: 2-door, 2-passenger, front-engine, RWD convertible EPA Mileage: 27/34 mpg (city/hwy) L x W x H: 154.1 x 68.3 x 48.8 in Wheelbase: 90.9 in Weight: 2,312 lb 0-60 MPH: 6.0 sec Top Speed: 128 mph (est)\n\n30 Years of Love\n\nAutomobile has showered the GTI and Miata with awards and glowing Four Seasons test reviews.

All the same, the Miata is not pure frivolity; it's a seriously considered entity.\"\n\nJanuary 1991: 1990 Miata scores 90/100\n\nWe said: \"The Miata may not have the most isolated ride, the strongest engine, or the most comfortable interior, but when judged as a whole, it is the most exciting automobile built in years.\"\n\n1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997: Miata named Automobile All-Star\n\nWe said: \"The driving experience in the Miata is still basic and vital.\" -January 1992\n\n\"To our intense relief, Mazda has deliberately kept the Miata simple, resisting the inevitable temptation to make it longer, lower, and wider. So despite the passage of time, this roadster's unflappable character remains unaffected.\" -February 1996\n\nAugust 1999: Miata scores 4.5 out of 5 stars in a Four Seasons test\n\nWe said: \"The Miata is so fun to drive you forget about the rough engine, the cramped interior, your migraine headache, and the overdue mortgage payment.\"\n\n1999, 2001, 2002: Miata named Automobile All-Star\n\nWe said: \"What makes the new car more remarkable still is that not one squib, jot, or tittle of design purity or fundamental engineering excellence has been lost.\" -February 1999\n\nJanuary 2007: GTI named Automobile of the Year\n\nWe said: \"This GTI feels like it has more build quality than anything within miles of its price point. It exudes substance in ways that worthy, sometimes faster speed machines from the Far East -- the Subaru Impreza WRX, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, and the Mazdaspeed3, for instance -- just don't.\"\n\n2008, 2009: GTI named Automobile All-Star\n\nWe said: \"The GTI eclipses even the class-clown Mini Cooper for sheer spark and verve, it makes sense for real people who actually have to lead real lives, and it does it all without breaking the bank.\" -January 2008\n\nAugust 2008: GTI scores 4 stars in a Four Seasons test\n\nWe said: \"You'd have a hard time matching the GTI's combination of useful packaging, cheerful personality, and outright speed at any price -- and especially for less than $27,000.\"\n\nJanuary 2010: GTI named Automobile of the Year\n\nWe said: \"The Volkswagen GTI continues to burn the affordable-enthusiast-car flame like no other vehicle in the world. Because the new Mark 6 GTI, although only a mild update to the Mark 5 GTI, made a good thing even better.\"\n\n2011, 2012, 2013: GTI named Automobile All-Star\n\nWe said: \"The enduring appeal stems from passionate performance, subtle restraint, and detailed execution. ... This is a vehicle that often feels like more than it is.\" -February 2011\n\nMay 2011: GTI scores 4.5 stars in Four Seasons test\n\nWe said: \"Yes, this car has become more refined, more economical, and more reliable, but its underlying character is unchanged.\"\n\nJanuary 2015: GTI named Automobile All-Star\n\nWe said: \"Above all, the 2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI makes us want to drive. ... The GTI is quick and rewarding on narrow two-lane roads, with urgent acceleration from the turbo-four, eager turn-in, and a planted feel no matter how pockmarked the pavement.\"\n\nShow more", "Four Seasons testing dates to our first-ever issue, with the introduction of a Mercedes-Benz 300E.

Of course, I'm jealous at that time; a little bit now, too.\n\n\"Still, when the car came and she said, 'Michael,' he didn't see me. He's like, 'Hey dude,'\" Tyson said, referring to a young Pitt, gesturing that the then-struggling actor was smoking on something. \"My right hand on God. But anyway, we met and stuff and that was my first thinking... 'he's a really nice guy.'\"\n\nConsider yourself lucky, Brad.

The blog claims a source has disclosed the news to them. The previously rumored M2 CS/CSL make a lot of sense.\n\nSince the regular M2 is already a great platform for BMW. The idea of a M2 CSL began even before the M2 Coupe was unveiled late last year with many rumors. Several reports have been citing their own sources to claim a BMW ME CS/CSL is in development.\n\nThe best idea for the imagined car can be derived from the M4 GTS. It is the perfect example of what the M engineers can achieve. The M2 is a lightweight and track-focused platform.\n\nThe rumored M2 could feature design cues like distinctive wheel arches creasing and a wing. It is possible all of the aerodynamic parts may be fixed. Every CSL vehicle goes through a similar treatment. The idea is to turn a standard BMW road car into a track monster.\n\nThe CSL treatment allegedly adds lightness to the mix. As the BMW cars are stripped out, widened, lowered and given more aggressive aerodynamics. If a new M2 CS/CSL is in planning it should be no different.\n\nAnother feature to expect in the rumored M2 CSL is quite a nice bump in power. It is believed the standard M2 has around 370 horse powers so a CSL should at least have 400 horse powers. Combined with the lower and the extra aerodynamics the M2 CSL may become one fine track car.", "Friends and family have left floral tributes at the scene of the collision where George Beresford died\n\nFamily and friends of a graduate who died after he was hit by a car metres from his home have paid tribute to a \"gorgeous boy\" and \"great friend\".\n\nGeorge Beresford, 21, a former pupil at John Fisher School, died three days after being hit by a BMW yards from his family home in Buttermere Gardens, Riddlesdown, earlier this month.\n\nIt is believed that his family were abroad at the time of the accident and he was kept on life support in hospital for three days to give them time to return to be by his bedside.\n\nDozens of bouquets of flowers have been left at the scene of the collision in Ingleboro Drive.\n\nRELATED: Man killed after being hit by a car in Purley named as 21-year-old George Beresford\n\nMr Beresford was a pupil at John Fisher School in Purley from 2005 to 2012.

In Europe, some customer reports indicate that current orders are now looking to be fulfilled in 2017. The demand for the M2 is high - and that's a good sign - confirming the attractiveness of this compact sports car in the market. Reports say that the M2 is currently being produced daily in low double-digit numbers at the BMW plant in in Leipzig - far too little for the high demand around the world which triggers some delivery delays.\n\nMany customers from Germany who spoke with our own Bimmertoday say that even four months after placing an order, they still don't have an exact delivery date, despite the market launch being scheduled for next month.\n\nAlthough the BMW M2 is officially not limited, the current production capacity at the Leipzig plant seems to cause bottlenecks. It's likely that the M2 production was planned this way with a ramp up strategy which is not unusual at BMW. Compared with other vehicles in the same production line at the Leipzig plant, the production of the BMW M2 is particularly complex, which is why we believe BMW has opted for a gradual ramp-up of production which will eventually raise the global units delivered.\n\nOver the entire production of the M2, BMW is expected to produce five-digit numbers, far more than the 6,300 BMW 1M units.\n\nIt's also likely that the demand for the M2 has taken BMW by surprise.

Todd Korol / Toronto Star via Getty Images\n\nLow-slung and sleek, its bulging wheel wells barely concealing the two-seater's 573 horsepower, you won't confuse the new 2017 Acura NSX with one of the Japanese luxury brand's more conventional sedans and SUVs.\n\nThe NSX is making its return to the Acura line-up after a decade's absence, and while its projected sales numbers are modest, less than 1,000 a year, it could become one of the marque's most important offerings since the first NSX was launched a quarter century ago.\n\n\"This car represents everything that Acura is,\" said Tomo Yokoi, the project's planner, during a media drive of the new NSX.\n\nMake that everything Acura was and would once again like to be. When the original supercar debuted it was a groundbreaking achievement on a number of levels. Acura was still a very new brand and the NSX declared it ready to go head-to-head with the best of its European competitors, even exotic makers like Porsche and Ferrari. The 1990 NSX was a technical tour de force, not only fast and sure-footed, but the first vehicle ever to use an entirely aluminum body and chassis.\n\nadvertisement 0:27 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nBut while Acura made some modest improvements over time, the NSX was dated and all but forgotten by the time it quietly vanished from the line-up in 2005. And, in many ways, it represented what happened to Acura itself. Once known for striking designs and cutting-edge technology, the brand had become little more than an afterthought, no longer a serious challenge to either mainstream European luxury marques Mercedes-Benz and BMW, or to Japanese powerhouse Lexus.\n\nRead More: Acura Bets on China, But Still Focused on the United States\n\nOf course, the fact that Acura couldn't initially come up with an NSX replacement was only a small part of the problem. For reasons company officials still have trouble defending, once sought-after Acura Legend and Integra models were not only replaced, but the new offerings adopted inexplicable names like RL and TL. Their performance was less than stellar, and their designs were, to be charitable, best described as \"controversial.\"\n\nAcura's sedan line-up languished. Were it not for its two stronger sport-utility offerings, the MDX and RDX, demand might have dried up entirely.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAcura's sales slid even more sharply than the industry as a whole, as the American automotive market plunged into its worst recession in decades. Effectively a U.S. brand, Acura didn't have the booming Chinese market as a fall back.\n\n\"Starting out after the recession, we could only whisper\" about the project, recalled Jon Ikeda. In 2010, as a team was formed to develop a new NSX, he was the brand's lead designer. Last year, after an unexpected management shake-up, he was named Acura's new general manager.\n\nLike the original, the 2017 NSX was designed to push boundaries. Spend an hour driving on public roads and you quickly realize how effective it is at turning heads.\n\nThen put it on a track and prepare for a thrill ride. The new sports car uses a radically different powertrain design: pairing a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 with three electric motors, one in back, two up front. That's both fast and nimble. The two motors up front not only boost acceleration but allow an uncanny degree of torque vectoring. By individually slowing or speeding up, they actually help steer the car through sharp corners while also improving traction on poor surfaces.\n\nRead More: Detroit Auto Show's Hot New Cars Are Meaner, Greener\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe NSX is the classic automotive \"halo car.\" Though Acura projects sales of less than 70 a month in the U.S. -- and some more through the parent Honda brand in other markets -- the supercar is expected to have an outside impact on the brand's image.\n\nAnd while the project was delayed by a year due to some late, and significant, technical and design changes, that timing might prove fortuitous. The car goes on sale weeks before an updated version of the brand's best-seller, the MDX utility vehicle. That should help bring lots of new -- and former Acura owners -- back into showrooms, Ikeda is betting.\n\nThe NSX also hits the street just after the January debut of the new Acura Precision Concept at the North American International Auto Show. That show car pushes the boundaries of contemporary automotive styling, much as cars like the Legend, Integra and first NSX did in their day.\n\n1:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog advertisement\n\nUnlike the 2012 Acura NSX Concept, there are no plans to build the latest show car. That said, Ikeda stressed that it is not only providing \"an internal rallying cry\" for the Acura team, but it also previews what automakers like to call the brand's new \"design language.\" Gone are much-maligned features like the chromed, shield-shaped grille that critics routinely derided as \"the beak.\"\n\nEven more than the NSX, the new styling theme will become apparent when the MDX debuts at the New York Auto Show in March, based on initial renderings Acura has released.\n\nIf the Acura provides the halo for the Acura brand, the MDX is its volume foundation. On the plus side, it has helped the Honda luxury marque rebound from the recession and post sales increases four years in a row.\n\nBut even the successful launch of both NSX and MDX won't ensure Acura's turnaround. The maker is still struggling to find a formula for its sedans. Future updates will need to more directly translate the Precision Concept.\n\nMeanwhile, Acura needs to respond to current market trends. It took a big risk when it launched the original MDX, but with SUVs, pickups and other light trucks handily outselling sedans, coupes and sports cars, Acura could use more utility vehicles in its model mix.\n\nThat will take some time, but Acura officials are hoping that they've bought some with the NSX debut, with the supercar garnering the brand some welcome public interest and much-needed showroom traffic.\n\nRead More from the Detroit Bureau Ford Pumps Up Fiesta with ST200 EditionNissan Spending $3.5 Billion on Share BuybackTesla Wins First Round in Fight with GMFederal Judge Demands Fix for VW Diesel Problem", "Usually when a car gets as many mid-life updates as the Infiniti Q50 is getting for 2016, it happens when said car is a complete and total failure, in desperate need of revamping to revive its fortunes. That isn't the case with the Q50; it was always a decent car, just not a great one, and up against some of the fiercest competition around.\n\nNow it gets an array of improvements, most notably an all-new 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 with 400 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque, plus massive tweaks to its drive-by-wire Direct Adaptive Steering system. After driving it, I can say the Q50 is closer to the car it should have been from the beginning. But is that enough?\n\n(Full disclosure: The Infiniti folks needed me to drive the updated Q50 so badly they put me up in the fancy Hotel Emma in my hometown of San Antonio, Texas and paid for all my food and booze.)\n\nLaunched in 2013, the Q50 was both the successor to Infiniti's ultra-popular G series of sedans and an attempt to find carve out real brand identity after decades spent fumbling around in the darkness with hit-or-miss luxury'd-up JDM Nissans.\n\nIt worked and it didn't. On one hand the Q50 is Infiniti's best-selling car. On the other hand the Q50 never garnered the enthusiasm or reputation for BMW-fighting (or tuning) that the G35 and G37 did.\n\nAn M-slaying Eau Rouge performance version with the Nissan GT-R's engine never materialized in production form despite much hype, nor did the manual gearbox alluded to at launch. It was fine on paper, just not that much fun to drive on real roads.\n\nhttp://jalopnik.com/what-its-like-...\n\nAnd the car's killer app, the steer-by-wire Direct Adaptive Steering, has stayed on the Q50 and the Q50 alone. Usually that kind of vaunted tech proliferates across the entire lineup. The fact that it didn't is very telling and indicates it probably wasn't ready for prime time.\n\nhttp://jalopnik.com/5953667/drivin...\n\nInfiniti says it is now, as is the rest of the Q50, which gets a much wider lineup for a lower entry price and more expensive top end. The venerable 3.7-liter VQ V6 engine, found in many a Nissan and Infiniti but now old enough to buy its own cigarettes, is gone.\n\nIts successor, the VR V6 is smaller, turbo-ier, lighter, more efficient and more powerful in top trim. It comes in 300 and 400 HP flavors on this car. There's also an entry-level 2.0-liter turbo four now, a Mercedes-derived engines with 208 HP. The 3.5-liter, 360 HP hybrid V6 sticks around.\n\nInfiniti knows it needs to try and re-establish the Q50's performance car creds, which is probably why the only car available to test was the top-shelf, 400 HP Q50S Red Sport. (They wanted me to mention that despite the name, it comes in more colors than just red. So, yeah: It comes in more colors than just red.)\n\nThe Q50's new motor is proof that two turbos can fix damn near anything. Make no mistake: this is a very, very good engine. The VQ wasn't perfect but it got the job done; this is vastly better, more modern, more powerful, and it pulls hard to redline with gobs of midrange torque. The top Q50 is a legitimately fast car now; the zero to 60 mph dash is estimated (by my ass) to be in the mid-4 second range, about a second quicker than it was in 3.7-liter form.\n\nMore than that, it feels like it has 400 HP; turn off the nannies and you can spin the tires hard and get the car nice and sideways whenever the urge should strike you and the cops aren't around. The engine lacks the VQ's honking drone, thank god, but while the new grunt is nicer it's pretty indistinctive. Whatever. It injects some badly-needed fun into the model.\n\nAnd yes, I'll say what everyone's thinking: I do want that 3.0 twin-turbo V6 in a smaller, lighter, rear-drive sports car with a manual and the last letter of the alphabet in its name. Get on it, Nissan. The current Camaro and Mustang deserve a real competitor from the East.\n\nThe Q50S comes in both rear- and all-wheel drive forms. Unfortunately the engine remains mated to a middling seven-speed automatic. Infiniti says this one's been re-tuned, but I still find it sluggish and lazy, particularly on upshifts. It's not even in the same universe as the ZF 8-speed auto or the dual clutch options on other luxury sedans out there.\n\nYou don't have to get the Direct Adaptive Steering, but you'll want to.\n\nEvidently Infiniti's plan to upsell buyers on that was to make the base electric rack so shitty that anyone who cares about driving at all will opt for the more expensive system. The base steering is loose, flimsy, devoid of feel, like a bad Lexus from 10 years ago.\n\nOut on an impromptu slalom and autocross course, the DAS proved its worth when driven back-to-back with the other car. (More detail on how it works here.)\n\nIt's tighter, much more direct, and with a greater degree of customization. It's an interesting animal, this drive-by-wire rack. It's almost entirely devoid of the road vibrations you don't want, yet it still translates the amount of steering feel you do want.\n\nInfiniti says the benefits of this system are less complexity, less weight, supposedly less maintenance, more responsiveness, and less fatigue on the driver because of the reduced vibrations. I'm not yet convinced it's anything more than a gimmick, especially since electric racks seem to be getting better and better.\n\nThe DAS still has a kind of weird artifice to it that's hard to describe in words, but it's highly effective and definitely the better option here. (I heard the opposite opinion from a few other reporters on this trip; your mileage may vary.)\n\nThe car remains a decent handler, more agile than before with a tweaked suspension, adaptive now for the first time ever, but that and the overall chassis just aren't on the same level as a BMW 3 Series or a Cadillac ATS. The car's standard Dunlop summer run-flats didn't do it any favors.\n\nThe Q50's interior is simple but tasteful, pleasant but not extravagant. Materials are mostly high-quality, even if it lacks the design flair you get from a competing German machine. Perhaps my biggest beef with the car remains how slapdash its user interface feels.\n\nThere's all sorts of settings for drive modes, steering functions, ride settings, driver alerts and semi-autonomous features, but they're splayed across dash buttons, the gauge cluster menus, buttons on the center console and the infotainment system.\n\nYou know how some people have, like, 14 remotes for their TV, BluRay player and stereo, and can never figure out which one does what? It's that, in car form. And just as fun to operate.\n\nAs it has since day one, the Q50 includes a wide array of almost-self-driving tech features and options like lane-keeping, auto steering on the highway (though it beeps at you if you don't keep your hands on the wheel), emergency auto braking with pedestrian detection, collision alerts and more. Infiniti was first to market with a lot of that, but three years later it feels dated compared to what Tesla, Mercedes and Volvo are doing.\n\nIt's also interesting that Infiniti plays up all of those features, as well as the idea that the Q50 is a performance-oriented driver's car. Can such a vehicle do both, or is it trying to serve two masters? I suppose that's the way everything's going now. You can bet the next 3 Series will practically drive itself the way a 7 Series can.\n\nSo the updated Q50 is a better car than it was. The new twin-turbo motor is a legitimate win and should make it more competitive in the marketplace. Adding the turbo four was a smart move, too. And the DAS is finally where it should be, which is why it's going to the Q60 coupe next; time will tell if it catches on.\n\nBut I walked away from this test wondering why I'd recommend the Q50 to someone over, say, a 3 Series, an ATS, a C-Class or even an Audi A4 or S4.\n\nPricing, I suppose; Infiniti wasn't ready to discuss that on the drive, but the new engines will stretch the price range quite a bit. The pre-update Q50 started at $37,150 and went to about $50,000. If the twin-turbo V6 can be had with lots of options for about the same, it will have value going for it.\n\nThat doesn't make it the best sport sedan out there but it does show improvement on Infiniti's part. Even if the brand's not where it needs to be yet, 400 HP can make everything at least feel better.", "The latest model of the Opel Astra has been named Europe's 2016 Car of the Year, organisers of the award said Monday ahead of the March 3-13 Geneva International Motor Show.\n\nThe small family car fought off competition from hefty rivals including the Audi A4, the BMW Series 7 limousine, the Jaguar XE, Maza MX-5 roadster, the Skoda Superb and a Volvo 4x4, the XC90.\n\nThe prize, determined by a jury of 58 motoring journalists in 22 countries, is the most prestigious car award in Europe and is widely used in advertising by the winning manufacturer.\n\nOpel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann said the firm's designers had rethought the entire Astra model, in particular in areas of high tech.\n\n\"We have gone through each detail and we have listened to the customer and made this car efficient in all areas,\" he said. \"(...) It's the best connected car in its segment.\"\n\nOpel, a struggling unit of the US giant General Motors, is to unveil a concept sports car, the Opel GT, at the Geneva show. Its products are sold in Britain under the Vauxhall badge.\n\nThe firm earned the 2012 Car of the Year award for its model the Ampera, and won in 2009 for the Insignia.", "The Jaguar equivalent of a BMW M3 GTS or a Porsche 911 GT3 is finally here. After testing at the Nurburgring for over one year, the F-Type SVR is ready in both coupe and convertible form. We caught an early glimpse of both cars at the Geneva Motor Show 2016, where these bad boys sat alongside the F-Pace and XF.\n\nJust like the BMW and the Porsche models mentioned above, the SVR twins are less classy, appealing only to the hardcore fans of the brand. The original F-Type was all about long flowing lines and curves you wanted to stroke. But if you do that to the SVR, you may get cut on its sharp edges.\n\nJust like its Range Rover Sport brother, the F-Type SVR is defined by large air intakes on either side of the grille. All the trim is painted in black, which is now the golden standard of high-performance machinery. The transformation also includes vents in the aluminum hood and inserts for the front fenders, right under the Jaguar logos.\n\nFrom the back, the not-so-subtle fixed wing and rear diffuser are impossible to miss. Just like the roof, they are made from carbon fiber for extra visual appeal.\n\nBut you won't be able to hear the critics saying that your Jaguar looks too vulgar because the F-Type SVT comes standard with a titanium exhaust system. Ceramic brakes and lightweight forged wheels are also part of the transformation. Despite the extremes Jaguar went to with their GT3 rival, they only managed to shave 90 lbs (43 kg). That's because the designers resisted the urge to strip the interior of all the air conditioning, infotainment system or other comfort features.\n\nThe AWD system has also been kept and is needed to keep the 575 PS (567bhp) supercharged V8 in check. It's only 25 ponies more than the standard R, but every little bit matters when you want to have 0.4 seconds off the 0 to 100 km/h sprint and offer a top speed of 200 mph (322 km/h). However, that's only for the coupe, as the convertible is less slippery and admits defeat at 194 mph (312 km/h).\n\nThe Nissan GT-R Nismo rival will start from \u00a3110,000 for the Coupe and \u00a3115,485 for the Convertible - that's a price hike of nearly \u00a320,000 over the F-Type V8 R AWD.", "This week, The Car Guide is heading to Switzerland in order to eat some fondue, wash it down with copious amounts of kirsch and do a few bank transactions.

Rimac Automobili will show off their Concept_One, equipped with four electric motors for a total of 1088 hp. Denmark's Zenvo will present the ST1 with its supercharged and turbocharged V8 engine that punches out 1104 hp.

China's Shanghai Composite index fell to its lowest level in a month, after dropping as much as 4.6 percent earlier in the day on worries that wealthy investors are shifting their investments from stocks to realty. China's central bank guided the yuan to its weakest level in three weeks.\n\nHowever, the markets reversed direction after China's central bank lowered the amount of cash that banks should keep in reserve in a bid to support slowing economic growth amid a weakening currency and tumbling stock markets.\n\nThe People's Bank of China reduced the renminbi deposit reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points in a surprise move on Monday. The cut will be effective March 1.\n\nThe reduction in reserve requirement will help to maintain adequate liquidity in the financial system, guide steady moderate growth of money and credit and boost supply-side structural reforms to improve the monetary and financial environment, the bank said in a statement on its website.\n\nRising crude oil prices also helped the markets to recover, amid further signs that major producers are nearing a deal to freeze output.

Adjusted organic earnings in Spain fell about 7 percent, trailing the average estimate, according to analysts at Berenberg. The stock declined as much as 2.9 percent.\n\nThe Spanish drop leaves Telefonica with few growth markets as revenue is also shrinking from Brazil, its second-largest region, where the economy is struggling and the currency has declined.

Sales there had risen for the first time in seven years during the third quarter.\n\nThe earnings \"highlight that they still operate in tough and competitive markets,\" James Ratzer, an analyst at New Street Research LLP, said by phone from London.

They had dropped 32 percent in the past year through Thursday.\n\nAs part of the Spanish sales push, the carrier offered customers discounted subscriptions to its pay-TV service until the end of the year and announced in January a 2.4 billion euro-agreement for Spanish and European soccer rights.

The confirmation comes, however, a week after Paris-based media giant Vivendi announced it was in advanced discussions with Telefonica to launch a mobile first video services across Latin America this fall.\n\nEurope's second biggest telco saw total consolidated 2015 revenues hit \u20ac47.2 billion ($52.2 billion), up 4% on 2014.\n\nFull-year Telefonica core profits were \u20ac11.4 billion ($12.6 billion), an increase of 3.6% on 2014 but dragged down by depreciation of local currencies in Latin America. Net profits fell to \u20ac2.7 billion ($3.0 billion), hit by one-off costs.\n\nThe Latin American pay TV rollout is consistent with Telefonica's content drive in Spain, one of its three key markets, along with Germany and Brazil, and a centerpiece to its digital age strategy.\n\nIn December, Telefonica paid $830 million for a weekly Spanish Liga soccer game featuring either Real Madrid or Barcelona soccer club, to slot into its El Partidazo primetime slot. It has coughed up \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.65 billion) to pay Spanish conglom Mediapro rights to European Champions League soccer matches and Spanish Liga games from September for the next three soccer seasons.\n\nAsked if its content drive diluted margins, Telefonica CSFO Angel Vil\u00e1 answered that the company's convergence process in Spain dates backed to 2011, when it drove into fibre optic network deployment to create speed and capacity. \"The second wave of data monetization, when you have in place this robust fibre structure, is about value-added services, and the main value added service is video. It's the crucial component to drive up data consumption in this new world.\"\n\nContent costs would be offset, also, by regulation-required wholesale sales of much content to rivals, and cost-containment at Telefonica in Spain via a voluntary early retirement scheme, Vila added.\n\nTelefonica can point to what could be seen as promising early results of convergence. Pay TV subs rose from 730,300 in March 2014 to 3.67 million year-end 2015, after the integration of Canal Plus from May 1, plus discounted offers for Fusion multi-play and the launch of quad-play offers with Canal Plus, including its Yomvi VOD service. Telefonica's pay-TV subs rose 75,800 end-of-June to end-of-year. Fusion revenues per client increased 7.3% to \u20ac74.4 ($82.2) per month in the last quarter 2015, though it is unclear how much of that comes from possible high-paying Canal Plus customers migrating to Fusion.\n\n53% of pay TV customers contracted TV add-ons, said Sala.\n\nIn Brazil, Telefonica captured 100% of pay TV market growth in 2015, the company said Friday.\n\n\"What macro investors think has nothing to do with reality,\" Telefonica chairman-CEO Cesar Alierta said about Brazil at the analysts' conference call.\n\n\"The region will have tremendous growth in our sector in Latin America. Million of businesses will have to be digitized in Latin America. Who is going to do that? Telefonica,\" Alierta added.\n\nMuch Telefonica business in Latin America is still with low-revenue pre-pay cell phone customers. A content service would offer the chance to upgrade the client base.\n\nThe key question is, for Latin America, where the content for a pay TV service could come from. Via Telefe, Argentina's top free-to-air broadcaster, Telefonica has seen outstanding results with Argentine movies, invested as a minority partners and promoting them forcefully. But movies can't lead a VOD service. Little wonder Telefonica is driving into series production in Spain while Telefonica Studios is exploring production opportunities in Latin America. The giant telco needs content fast, as does Vivendi in France - which makes it a great age to be a major content supplier in both countries.", "Telef\u00f3nica reported EBITDA that was below analyst estimates for the fourth quarter of 2015 because of several one-off costs that analysts said were not known in advance.\n\nAccording to Jefferies International, EBITDA -- which Telef\u00f3nica refers to as OIBDA -- was well below the consensus estimate of \u20ac764 million ($822 million) at \u20ac401 million because of various costs that had not been anticipated by analysts. These included a \u20ac325 million provision for the financing needs of Telef\u00f3nica Foundation and a \u20ac30 million provision in Spain for restructuring distribution.\n\nThe company also posted an operating loss of \u20ac1.76 billion for the quarter, which was higher than consensus estimates of \u20ac1.36 billion. The net loss was \u20ac1.83 billion, down from a net income of \u20ac303 million a year previously.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica noted that the annual results and particularly those of the quarter were affected by various non-recurring impacts, and said a provision of \u20ac3.12 billion was booked in this regard.\n\nThere were some positive one-offs, however, including a \u20ac102 million E-Plus purchase price adjustment; \u20ac98 million from the 'expiration of account payable' in Brazil; \u20ac79 million from a Mexico spectrum swap; and \u20ac22 million from the sale of domestic real estate. Revenue in the fourth quarter was unchanged year-on-year at \u20ac11.88 billion, which Jefferies said was 0.5 per cent above consensus.\n\nIn 2015 as a whole, revenue increased 8.7 per cent in reported terms to \u20ac47.22 billion, while OIBDA was 17.2 per cent lower in reported terms at \u20ac11.41 billion. Group net income was 8.5 per cent lower at \u20ac2.74 billion. However, in underlying terms net income reached \u20ac5.78 billion, which was 29.7 per cent higher than in 2014.\n\nIn organic terms, a more positive picture is presented for 2015 as a whole, with revenue growth accelerating to 4 per cent year-on-year, OIBDA increasing 3.6 per cent -- boosted by the efficiencies stemming from the integration synergies in Germany and Brazil and the simplification program of the group -- while the operating cash flow in the year returned to growth of 1.9 per cent.\n\nFor 2016, the Spain-based operator expects to see group organic revenue growth of more than 4 per cent with a stabilisation of the OIBDA margin. The company remains broadly optimistic, with chairman and CEO C\u00e9sar Alierta saying: \"If 2015 has been a very positive year, in 2016 growth and data monetisation will accelerate, while we maximise the efficiencies from integration and simplification, and we boost our innovation and big data capabilities.\"\n\nFor more:\n\n- see the Telef\u00f3nica results release\n\n- see the Telef\u00f3nica figures", "According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research \"Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 - 2023,\" the global MVNO market is expected to reach a value of US$ 75.25 Bn by 2023. The market is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period from 2015 to 2023.\n\nFull Research Report on Global Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Market at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/mobile-virtual-network-operator-market.html\n\nAdditional unused bandwidth offered by mobile network operators (MNOs) to reap further revenue benefits from MVNOs, is one of the major factors driving the MVNO market. Further, as the MVNOs use existing infrastructure of MNOs, it becomes comparatively easy to enter the telecom industry and focus on niche target markets. MVNOs also enable MNOs to increase their customer base via MVNOs. Moreover, telecom regulators in mature markets such as Europe and North America have focused on increasing competition in the sector to regulate price offerings and promote innovation.\n\nThe introduction of 4G services in the market is expected to further benefit the MVNOs with better speed, and value add services (VAS). In 2014, Europe held the major market share in terms of revenue generated by MVNO globally, followed by North America. However, Latin America and Asia Pacific are forecast to grow at a faster rate as compared to these mature markets.\n\nGet Sample of Research Report for more info: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=3261\n\nAmong the MVNO operational models, full-MVMO held the largest market share of approximately 61% in 2014, with the increasing need for value added services (VAS) in MVNO. Full MVNOs have the access to content and service applications essential to provide VAS. Furthermore, due to the intense competition in the MVNO market, Full MVNO operational model is gaining more popularity, so as to offer differentiated services to customers and reap benefits with higher margins as compared to a reseller MVNO or service operator MVNO. In terms of MVNO types, discount, telecom, and migrant accounted for major share of revenue in 2014. However, M2M is expected to grow at the fastest rate with the rise in Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nWith the increase in number of travelers and migrants, the consumer market is inclined toward discounts and low international call rates offered by MVNOs to ethnic groups in mature markets such as Europe and North America. Within the prepaid and postpaid services, prepaid customers account for the major market in MVNO services. Postpaid services are expected to observe gradual growth in the coming years with the high demand for data services and growth of the M2M segment.\n\nSome of the key players operating in the MVNO market include AT&T Inc., Lycamobile Group, Sprint Corporation, T-Mobile AG, Verizon Communication Inc., CITIC Telecom International Holdings Ltd., Telefonica S.A., TracFone Wireless Inc., Truphone Ltd., and Virgin Mobile.\n\nCustomized solution for your market research needs:http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/custom-research.html\n\nThe mobile virtual network operator market is segmented as below:\n\nOther Research Reports by Transparency Market Research:\n\nAbout Us\n\nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

The market is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period from 2015 to 2023.\n\nFull Research Report on Global Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Market at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/mobile-virtual-network-operator-market.html\n\nAdditional unused bandwidth offered by mobile network operators (MNOs) to reap further revenue benefits from MVNOs, is one of the major factors driving the MVNO market. Further, as the MVNOs use existing infrastructure of MNOs, it becomes comparatively easy to enter the telecom industry and focus on niche target markets. MVNOs also enable MNOs to increase their customer base via MVNOs. Moreover, telecom regulators in mature markets such as Europe and North America have focused on increasing competition in the sector to regulate price offerings and promote innovation.\n\nThe introduction of 4G services in the market is expected to further benefit the MVNOs with better speed, and value add services (VAS). In 2014, Europe held the major market share in terms of revenue generated by MVNO globally, followed by North America. However, Latin America and Asia Pacific are forecast to grow at a faster rate as compared to these mature markets.\n\nGet Sample of Research Report for more info: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=3261\n\nAmong the MVNO operational models, full-MVMO held the largest market share of approximately 61% in 2014, with the increasing need for value added services (VAS) in MVNO. Full MVNOs have the access to content and service applications essential to provide VAS. Furthermore, due to the intense competition in the MVNO market, Full MVNO operational model is gaining more popularity, so as to offer differentiated services to customers and reap benefits with higher margins as compared to a reseller MVNO or service operator MVNO. In terms of MVNO types, discount, telecom, and migrant accounted for major share of revenue in 2014. However, M2M is expected to grow at the fastest rate with the rise in Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nWith the increase in number of travelers and migrants, the consumer market is inclined toward discounts and low international call rates offered by MVNOs to ethnic groups in mature markets such as Europe and North America. Within the prepaid and postpaid services, prepaid customers account for the major market in MVNO services. Postpaid services are expected to observe gradual growth in the coming years with the high demand for data services and growth of the M2M segment.\n\nSome of the key players operating in the MVNO market include AT&T Inc., Lycamobile Group, Sprint Corporation, T-Mobile AG, Verizon Communication Inc., CITIC Telecom International Holdings Ltd., Telefonica S.A., TracFone Wireless Inc., Truphone Ltd., and Virgin Mobile.\n\nCustomized solution for your market research needs: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/custom-research.html\n\nThe mobile virtual network operator market is segmented as below:\n\nOther Research Reports by Transparency Market Research:\n\nAbout Us\n\nTransparency Market Research (TMR) is a market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

and uncompleted - 2013 merger with Portugal Telecom, a tie-up that effectively unraveled when Oi sold Portuguese assets it had acquired from PT to Luxembourg's Altice.", "Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges often says Europe needs fewer, bigger telecommunications carriers that can invest in faster networks and better compete with Google and Facebook. Deutsche Telekom has a 12% stake in BT.\n\nIt is an oft-repeated mantra European telecom bosses use when justifying their deal spree of the past four years, during which they have snapped up rivals within countries to reduce competitive pressure and to combine fixed, mobile, and broadband services.\n\nYet so far they have all stopped short of big bang, cross-border deals, and for good reason: There is deep scepticism that such combinations would generate enough cost savings or revenue growth to justify the premium the sellers would command.\n\nWhat is more, regulation on everything from broadband to mobile spectrum remains stubbornly national despite years of talk in Brussels of creating a single market for telecoms.\n\nMr Hoettges could be tempted to test this conventional wisdom by bidding for BT Group.\n\nThe German carrier has become BT's biggest shareholder with a 12% stake after it elected to be paid partly in stock for a holding in EE, Britain's largest mobile operator, last year.\n\nMr Hoettges should resist the siren song of such a cross-border deal for now -- and move only if a real catalyst emerges that makes a larger European footprint an advantage.\n\nThat could be a merger of rivals Vodafone and Liberty Global or a move by regulators to encourage sports and movie rights to be sold across Europe rather than by country.\n\nFor now, the BT stake gives him a useful option as companies from France's Orange to the Netherlands' KPN stake out ground for the next round of consolidation.\n\nMove too soon, and Mr Hoettges risks throwing away the goodwill he has earned for turning around a money-losing US mobile business and an ambitious network improvement strategy in its key home market.\n\nDeutsche Telekom shares have outperformed major peers like Vodafone and Telefonica since January 2014 when Mr Hoettges took over, as well as the European telecoms index.\n\nThe stock trades at more than 16 times time estimated earnings -- a premium to BT.\n\nSo far Mr Hoettges, who just joined BT's board, has said he will happily partner with Britain's former monopoly on technology and marketing projects, and pledged that any deal would have to create value for shareholders.\n\nA deal for BT would be expensive. BT trades at about 15 times estimated earnings, compared with less than nine times earnings four years ago.\n\nDeutsche is more heavily indebted than its British peer: Its net debt is about 2.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation.\n\nTo fund a cash offer, Deutsche Telekom would have to sell its 65% stake in T-Mobile US, the third-placed mobile carrier in the US with a market value of $30bn (\u20ac27.25bn).\n\nThat makes it more likely Deutsche Telekom would have to pay in stock.\n\nIf, for example, Deutsche Telekom offered a standard 30% premium for BT, about 596 pence per share all in stock, it would need to come up with at least \u20ac1bn of annual pre-tax synergies to make such a deal modestly accretive right off the bat."], "2016-02-29": ["Telefonica and Chinese mobile operator China Unicom have announced plans to launch the low-cost C630 smartphone from Chinese vendor Phicomm in key Telefonica markets in Latin America later this year. The deal to sell the C630 is part of the joint procurement agreement signed by Telefonica and China Unicom last year to select smartphones based on shared specifications at improved economies of scale. The C630 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 210-powered, LTE-enabled handset with a 5-inch FWVGA screen and 1GB RAM that sells for the equivalent of around EUR 35 in the Indian market. In a statement, Telefonica said the phone would be available in Latin America starting from the second quarter and that the distribution deal was part of its aim to accelerate the penetration of 4G devices and services at more affordable end-consumer price points. As part of their first joint procurement project, Telefonica and China Unicom last year acquired low-cost 4G smartphones from the manufacturers Lenovo and TCL.", "Small cap cloud communications stocks like magicJack VocalTec Ltd (NASDAQ: CALL), Vonage Holdings Corp (NYSE: VG) and up and coming ChitrChatr Communications (OTCMKTS: CHICF) are at the forefront of the future of how we communicate. Here is what investors need to know about each of these cloud communication plays:\n\nmagicJack VocalTec Ltd. The inventor of magicJack and a pioneer in Voice over IP (VoIP) technology and services, small cap magicJack VocalTec Ltd is a leading cloud communications company. The company has sold more than 10 million magicJack devices (now in its fourth generation), has millions of downloads of its free calling app and holds more than 30 technology patents. Last May, magicJack VocalTec Ltd announced a Strategic Commercial Agreement with Telefonica S.A. (NYSE: TEF) that was apparently finalized late last year to market the MagicJack device and app to the Spanish carrier's 20 million Mexican mobile subscribers, with the potential to expand to other Latin American countries. Telefonica, S.A. has approximately 185 million mobile customers and 25 million landline customers in Latin America while for magicJack VocalTec Ltd, the deal was considered a significant first step in implementing their international distribution strategy and for turning the company around. In November, Bloomberg did a story about how hedge fund investors are sticking with the stock, noting that Whitney Tilson had touted the company in February of last year when he said it was a beaten-down stock with great management and fixable problems. Others remain skeptical that the company can transform itself from a voice-over-IP company to a provider of free mobile communication services. In November, magicJack VocalTec Ltd reported total net revenues of $25.8 million as net revenues from the sales of magicJack devices were $3.1 million and access rights renewal revenues were $16.8 million, an increase of 4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and accounting for 65% of total net revenues. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2014 was $1,000 compared to income of $2.3 million for the second quarter of 2014. The CEO said:\n\n\"The Company made good progress on its strategic growth initiatives in the third quarter, evidenced by the strong initial demand for our magicJackGO as well as the ongoing momentum of our international rollout. While we recognize that Q3 was a quarter of transition, we are well positioned to return the company to growth going forward, particularly given our strong balance sheet and consistent ability to generate cash.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, small cap magicJack VocalTec Ltd rose 0.8% to $7.55 (CALL has a 52 week trading range of $6.87 to $25.37 a share) for a market cap of $134.44 million plus shares are down 3.7% since the start of the year, down 45.1% over the past year and up 118.8% over the past five years.\n\nVonage Holdings Corp. A leading provider of cloud communications services for consumers and businesses across connected devices, small cap Vonage Holdings Corp provides a robust suite of feature-rich residential and business communication solutions that run over the top of a customer's existing broadband connection. In addition and through Telesphere, Vonage Holdings Corp offers service with carrier-grade performance over a private national MPLS broadband network that is well suited to address the needs of larger businesses with multiple offices. Just this morning, Vonage Holdings Corp reported revenue of $869 million compared with $829 million in the prior year due to the full year impact of Vonage Business Solutions (VBS) which the Company acquired in November 2013. GAAP net income was $20 million or $0.10 per share in 2014, down from $28 million or $.13 per share in the prior year (but excluding adjustments, income was $60 million or $0.28 per share, up from $52 million or $0.24 per share in 2013). The CEO stated:\n\n\"We concluded a year of strong strategic progress as we accelerated the growth of Vonage Business Solutions, and we took disciplined actions in the Consumer business to optimize profitability. We doubled our addressable market in the large and growing Small and Medium Business (\"SMB\") sector and strengthened the Company's leadership position in Unified Communications-as-a-Service (\"UCaaS\") with the acquisition of Telesphere, and we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth at Telesphere as we did with VBS. We now have the right assets in place to build Vonage into the clear leader in cloud communications, including a talented and experienced management team, a stellar brand, a low cost structure, great technology platforms, and excellent cash flows and financial flexibility.\"\n\nIn early December, Vonage Holdings Corp announced initiatives designed to enhance shareholder value, including a new $100 million share repurchase program, the wind down of a joint venture and consumer operations in Brazil in order to focus on higher return opportunities and the expected completion of the Telesphere acquisition. The CEO stated:\n\n\"Given the higher investment return opportunities in the U.S. consumer and large and growing Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) markets, we have decided to focus our efforts and capital in these areas. The Telesphere acquisition represents a critical step in our growth within the UCaaS market, and enables Vonage to gain critical mass within the small and medium business (SMB) segment and address the needs of a wider range of enterprises. Upon closing, we expect to replicate at Telesphere the proven integration model we demonstrated with Vonage Business Solutions, where we increased revenue growth to 52% from 38% in a year by using Vonage's scale, brand, balance sheet and cash generation to invest in and accelerate growth.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, small cap Vonage Holdings Corp fell 2.43% to $4.22 (VG has a 52 week trading range of $3.10 to $4.95 a share) for a market cap of $911.50 million plus shares are up 10.8% since the start of the year, down 5.8% over the past year and up 201.45 over the past five years.\n\nChitrChatr Communications. Up and coming small cap ChitrChatr Communications is developing a proprietary internet-based communications platform called the Comprehensive Universal Unified Communications Platform (CUUCP) which will offer communications services to users delivered through a fully integrated global communications platform and user friendly interface. The CUUCP will be a common unified application that integrates virtually all methods of communication (175 of them), including audio, video, conference calling, messaging, chat room, texting, facsimile, email and social networking services, into one easy to use platform. For example: Instead of being forced to switch back and forth from WhatsApp, to Google Hangouts, to Facebook Messenger, to MSN, to Yahoo, etc., to send/receive messages to specific contacts, ChitrChatr Communications incorporates all contacts on different chat and video calling applications under one umbrella. Moreover, the CUUCP platform does not use the public circuit-switched telephone networks of land telephone lines, cellular networks and satellite service. Instead, its based on VoIP and uses internet services and data transmission. In January, ChitrChatr Communications secured a line of credit for $2,000,000 to be used to complete the final development of its platform after testing and for marketing efforts. In November, the company announced the integration of a new, highly advanced email filter system (Advanced Mail Filter System) that allows CUUCP subscribers to \"blacklist\" and block all future email contact from any selected sender (Note: Unlike most existing email services in which blacklisting a sender will simply divert their emails to a spam/bulk folder, any email that arrives at the SMTP server from a blacklisted address will be immediately rejected by the system and the sender will receive a \"delivery failure notification\"). On Wednesday, small cap ChitrChatr Communications rose 0.75% to $1.35 (CHICF has a 52 week trading range of $0.27 to $1.76 a share) for a market cap of $42.14 million plus shares are up 35% since the start of the year, up 60.1% over the past year and up 33.7% since November 22nd.", "The 3rd meeting of the Inaugural Coordination Council of the Net Mundial Initiative (NMI.CC), hosted by Telefonica in Madrid on February 27, 2016, paved the way for the second phase of the innovative NMI platform. The council discussed how to adjust the strategic orientation and the structural design of the initiative, so that future activities are more focused on implementation of the Sao Paulo principles and roadmap. Developing a closer relationship with the UN sponsored Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was also recognized as a near term priority. And the potential target of a NetMundial 5+ Conference in 2019 to review progress made since 2014 was identified as a concrete goal for the initiative.\n\nThe 2014 Net Mundial Conference\n\nThe NetMundial conference in April 2014 was an innovation in Internet Governance. It pioneered an enhanced version of the multistakeholder Internet Governance model by introducing an outcome oriented collaboration on equal footing among all stakeholders in their respective roles. NM went beyond existing multistakeholder mechanisms such as WSIS (governmental leadership with non-governmental stakeholders in a consultation role) and ICANN (private sector leadership with governments in an advisory capacity). It also summarized the essence of nearly two dozens of declarations on Internet Governance principles, adopted between 2010 and 2013 by individual stakeholder groups or regional organizations as OECD and Council of Europe. The NetMundial outcome solidified the foundational concept that universal human rights principles should underpin Internet governance processes and must function as bedrock global norms in the Internet governance ecosystem. The Sao Paulo principles should be recognized as universally applicable principles for Internet Governance, supported by ALL stakeholders from ALL regions of the world.\n\nThe NetMundial conference outcome luckily influenced other global Internet Governance discussions in 2014 and 2015 to a high degree, which -- after Snowden's revelations -- were at a crossroads. The conference and its follow up built bridges, removed tensions and demonstrated that multistakeholder collaboration is better than multilateral confrontation. In that regard, NetMundial helped to avoid the emergence of a cold cyberwar.\n\nThe \"Peace of Busan\" (November 2014) has limited the risk that the ITU will continue with the Dubai-Disaster of the WCIT and enter into a senseless conflict with ICANN. The extension of the mandate of the IGF by the WSIS 10+ Review Conference (December 2015), finally removed the fear that a strong multistakeholder discussion platform would disappear or be substituted by an intergovernmental Internet council. And ICANNs progress with the IANA transition has demonstrated that the time consuming and very often painful multistakeholder bottom up open and transparent process for Internet Governance is working.\n\nEven in such a sensitive area like cybersecurity the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in the UN could agree on Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace (CBMCs) and the presidents of the United States of America and the Peoples Republic of China agreed to stop cyber-espionage in the economic field in September 2015. Both cyber superpowers sit on the governmental bench of the Inaugural NMI Coordination Council, with their respective ministers -- Penny Pritzker and Lu Wei.\n\nThe role of the council in its first phase was to stabilize the outcome of the Sao Paulo conference by introducing a high level follow up process, based on the Sao Paulo principles. The establishment of the NMI.CC and the adoption of the Terms of Reference (TOR) enhanced public awareness and allowed the emergence of new procedures and projects aimed at the implementation of the Sao Paulo roadmap. The composition of the council -- four stakeholders from each of the five regions on equal footing -- created a new model for the formation of leadership teams in global Internet Governance. The Solution Map and some other pilot projects helped to identify new emerging issues and introduced innovative forms of multistakeholder collaboration.\n\nYet, the Net Mundial Initiative needs to evolve to find a sustainable model. The mandate of the members of the Inaugural Coordination Council expires June 30, 2016, as does the support of the founding organizations (the Brazilian ccTLD Registry cgi.br, the World Economic Forum and ICANN). The Madrid meeting was directed to the challenge of how to move NMI to a second more sustainable phase in light of the evolved Internet Governance landscape of 2016.\n\nThe new reality is that there is no urgent need anymore to have a fall-back position for a worst case scenario where the multistakeholder model is rejected. In the WSIS 10+ Outcome Document the governments of the 193 UN Member States supported the multistakeholder model and took note of the NetMundial Conference. This new environment allows NMI to shift its priorities. The initiative can concentrate now more on its most innovative elements -- the Sao Paulo principles and procedures -- and make them more visible and sustainable.\n\nAdjusting strategic orientation and structural design\n\nIn its TORs the NMI describes itself as an \"enabling platform\" which is aimed to bring solutions to problems. This is a very broad mandate. With the renewal of the mandate of the IGF and progress made in other areas there is no need that the NMI embraces all problems of the Internet Governance Ecosystem.\n\nIn the Madrid discussion council member Jean Francois Abramic from the World Wide Web Consortium remembered the early days of the W3C when Tim Barners Lee and his friends discussed what to do with their invention of the WWW. The wise decision was not to embrace the whole emerging web but to focus on a limited number of key issues.\n\nKey issues for NetMundial are the Internet Governance principles and the multistakeholder procedures.\n\nOne of the original NMI ideas, to offer a clearinghouse function in the form of the NMI Solution Map is probably too ambitious and can be realized more efficiently in close collaboration with similar projects as the EU sponsored Global Internet Policy Observatory (GIPO), the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise (GFCE) in The Hague or the Geneva Internet Platform.\n\nWhere the initiative is needed is to stabilize and enhance the political innovation which came with the NetMundial process where all stakeholders are involved on equal footing and base their activities on universal principles with a strong commitment to the respect of human rights and security in cyberspace. The discussion in Madrid circled around ideas how to monitor the implementation of the Sao Paulo outcome document and how to review progress.\n\nA NetMundial 5+ conference -- in close collaboration with the IGF in 2019 -- could be an option to streamline the process and to inspire new practical projects, in particular in the field of awareness raising, capacity building and development. It could also stimulate reality checks, deeper critical analysis and new explorations into practices of the multistakeholder collaboration, a model which is still in its infant stage.\n\nThe discussion around the structural design of the second phase of the NMI was inspired by the modernist architectural principles that \"form follows function\". NetMundial was from the very beginning a bottom up, open and transparent multistakeholder process. However, in its first phase some actions of the NMI gave the unhelpful impression that it is more top down than bottom up. There was and is full consensus among all council members that there is no space for a top down approach. Everything NMI does has to follow Principle 8 of the Sao Paulo Declaration (Internet Governance Process Principles) which includes openness, transparency, bottom up, inclusiveness, accountability etc. The Madrid discussion how to best redesign the initiative rooted in those principles. Changes in the current structure should be discussed in a broad community consultation.\n\nPart of the proposal for a new design is that the initiative will no longer include \"founding members\" with a \"permanent seat\" on a \"coordination council\". Instead the NMI will have a \"host\" on the bottom which serves as an anchor for the initiative in close collaboration with many partners from all stakeholder groups around the world who are ready to contribute in kind and in cash. CGI.br, as host of the Sao Paulo conference, has generously offered to play this role and to give NMI a home, subject to approval by CGI.br's board.\n\nAnother idea is that CGI.br will be assisted by a Global Multistakeholder Advisory Team (GMAT) as the working unit which organizes the processes needed to make NetMundial sustainable. The structure of the Advisory Team should follow the model of the Inaugural Coordination Council with representatives from all five world regions and four stakeholder groups who interact on equal footing.\n\nA third layer in this new design could be open ended multistakeholder working groups which can be initiated by anybody, who commits her/himself to the Sao Paulo document and respect the rules of the TOR. The formation of such working groups could follow the example of the IETF where anybody can start a process for a RFC but has to go through established procedures. NMI Co-Chair Marilia Maciel argued in Madrid that the procedures for chartering such working groups could get inspiration from ICANNs Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO). In ICANN it is the GNSO council who drafts the charter for a working group but the working groups are open to everybody, transparent and organized bottom up.\n\nClose Collaboration with the IGF\n\nAll this should be done in close collaboration with the IGF. The Madrid Communique underlines \"the desire to work closely with the Internet Governance Forum\". There are a lot of potential synergies between the planned inter-sessional work of the IGF and the new priorities of the NMI, in particular with regard to work in Internet Governance principles and enhanced procedures for multistakeholder collaboration at the national level.\n\nNMI meetings and workshops could be done back to back with regional and national IGFs.

Soon, two new employees will be joining and, within six months to a year, Neutron expects to be providing jobs to up to 20 people.\n\n\"There are many potential uses for VR,\" Mr Coates said. \"There's a lot of work out there and a lot of different industries are using this type of technology.\n\n\"Previously, people perhaps didn't realise what it can do, but now they can see it clearly.\"\n\nThe company's rise comes at time of explosive growth within the VR sector in North East, particularly in the Gateshead area, where the local authority has supported the development of a VR hub, VRTGO Labs, at Baltimore House.\n\nAn annual VRTGO conference and similar events are also held to showcase the potential of the cutting edge technology and how North East companies are using it to boost their business and improve customer experience.\n\nIt was at one of these events the Neutron's founders were introduced to Ren\u00e9 Batsford, digital innovation manager McDonald's Restaurants Ltd, with which the firm went on to collaborate on a major visualisation project that allow franchisees to choose the decor of their businesses based on an immerse experience.\n\n\"In the past, they would have picked that from a PDF, but we virtualised that and put them in the experience so they can get a feel of what it will actually look like,\" Mr Coates said.\n\nAn example of this store customisation work was rolled out in time to be used for demonstration purposes for the launch of Samsung's GearVR hardware.\n\nOther companies with which Neutron has been working including Hilton, Carphone Warehouse, Telefonica 02.\n\nIt has also been helping the County Durham-based Atom Bank in the development of its forthcoming app.\n\nAtom is aiming to become the UK's first truly digital bank, with no physical branches but a strong emphasis on the customer experience.\n\n\"The North East is a strong area for VR,\" Mr Coates added. \"It is renowned for being a games hub and VR is a perfect fit in that.\n\n\"The universities are also producing some really good students with the skill sets that we need.\"\n\nMr Batsford said he had been impressed by Neutron's background in gaming as well as the company's ability to deliver quality work on time and within budget.\n\n\"We have worked on a couple of projects together to date, one of which we showcased at a Samsung pop-up event which enthralled retailers who visited,\" he said.\n\n\"I would regard Neutron VR as a highly dependable, quality business that produces excellent work. Couple this with their industry knowledge of gaming and emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality, Neutron VR will become a business many organisations will turn to in the coming months and years to produce outstanding digital work.\n\n\"Neutron VR are game changers.\"", "Telef\u00f3nica's pay-TV platform Movistar is launching another full-frontal assault on the pay-TV market with a promotion for new subscribers.\n\nThe company will give its entire premium TV offer, including football, for \u20ac15.50 a month to new subscribers during the first three months. To enjoy the service, new clients will have to subscribe to Movistar Fusion and the promotion will include the Premium Extra package: football (La Liga, La Liga Adelante, Champions and Europa League, European and International Leagues), all sports (basketball, tennis, golf, Formula 1...), cinema, TV series and premium channels like Caza y Pesca and Musica Clasica.\n\nAt the end of the promotion, subscribers will have to pay \u20ac65 a month, the normal price for the Premium Extra package. With this promotion, the company aims to add new subscribers to its convergent packages and compete with Netflix and its rivals Vodafone and Orange.", "There's a thin line between getting new services and selling your privacy, which is why companies are looking for 'mutual value'.\n\nMany companies are stockpiling raw information, wrongly believing that the larger the amount of data they've collected, the greater its value.\n\nBut in businesses that depend on personal data, the greatest value will come not from mining, banking, or selling information, but from \"enabling individuals to use, experience and exchange it\", said Aldo de Jong, founder of consultancy Claro Partners. He was speaking at the 4YFN event, a conference running parallel to last week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\nPeople want to benefit from their data but \"they need control, trust, and transparency\", de Jong added. He also argued that the personal-data economy is about experience and based on small rather than big data.\n\nAs an example of how personal data can be used to benefit the individual, he cited the services of Simple, which claims to be an 'anti-bank' and seeks to distinguish itself from traditional banks by avoiding fees and offering customers data-rich analyses of their transactions. It's worth noting that in 2014, this online startup was bought by the traditional Spanish bank BBVA for $117m.\n\nAntonio \u00c1lvarez, an EMEA business development manager at Amazon Web Services, said the real issue is about exploring customer usage data to understand what the public feels and wants.\n\nFacebook chief privacy officer Stephen Deadman echoed this sentiment, underlining the need for bringing the value of data back to the user. He pointed to the Data-driven Society roundtable series in which Facebook has been participating, which is designed to \"sustainably maximize the contribution data makes to the economy, to society and to individuals\".\n\nKatryna Dow, founder and CEO of Meeco, an Australian tech company aiming to help users manage and control their digital relationships, stressed that it's about finding a balance between the hunger for data and privacy.\n\nThat balance, according to Pablo Rodr\u00edguez, a Telef\u00f3nica research and innovation director, comes down to establishing trust. Online services are built on trust, he said.\n\nThis same point was made by Raj Samani, CTO of EMEA at Intel Security, when speaking on a different panel at the 4YFN event. For Samani, the concept of privacy is changing and draws on three essential notions: consent, value, and transparency.\n\nGiven that people have many options for connecting with one another, \"Trust is the most important commodity for our future,\" he said. Companies should find ways to achieve real customer trust, because future applications can't evolve with that sense of security.\n\nRead more about data privacyData privacy: You may call it personal data but who actually owns it?France to Facebook: Stop tracking everyone on the internetDigital privacy about to feel real-world shock to its system", "BRUSSELS Feb 29 The following are mergers under review by the European Commission and a brief guide to the EU merger process:\n\n-- Coop subsidiary Bell AG to acquire poultry processing company HL Verwaltung (approved Feb. 26)\n\n-- German food company Tonnies to acquire Danish peer Tican (approved Feb. 26)\n\n-- Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion S.A.

It gained access to the vendor through a global procurement collaboration with China Unicom that was launched in 2015. Phicomm will also be able to establish a strategic partnership with Telef\u00f3nica in future, the operator added.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has already bought 4G smartphones from Lenovo and TCL under the China Unicom arrangement.\n\nIndeed, China-based vendors continue to make gains in terms of global market share, according to recent figures from IDC and Strategy Analytics for the fourth quarter of 2015. Both companies placed Huawei in third place after Samsung and Apple, with Lenovo ranked fourth.\n\nXiaomi, which enjoyed a meteoric rise in 2013 thanks to the rapidly growing smartphone market in its domestic Chinese market, missed previous targets to sell 100 million smartphones last year after it reported sales of 70 million. However, the vendor was still ranked fifth globally in the fourth quarter of the year by IDC, Strategy Analytics and Gartner.\n\nCounterpoint Research also noted recently that Lenovo and ZTE made massive gains in terms of market share in Russia, after Samsung and Apple both lost ground.\n\nLenovo replaced Apple as Russia's second-largest smartphone vendor by market share. The Chinese manufacturer's share increased from 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 11 per cent in the recent period. Domestic rival ZTE ranked in third place in the fourth quarter of 2015 after increasing its share from 2.8 per cent to 10 per cent.\n\nFor more:\n\n- see this Telef\u00f3nica release", "Foxconn's proposed acquisition of Sharp dominated the international ICT market last week.\n\nAt home, MTN's interim payment in Nigeria stole much of the local ICT media space.\n\nKey local news\n\n* Very good interim numbers from Blue Label Telecoms, with revenue up 24.7% and profit up 28.9%.\n\n* A full-year loss from Stella Capital Partners.\n\n* A positive trading update from EOH.\n\n* A mixed trading update from Alaris.\n\n* A negative trading update from Cognition Holdings.\n\n* MTN acquired almost 400km of long-distance and metro fibres, connecting Pretoria and Polokwane, from Liquid Telecom.\n\n* Naspers made an additional $250 million investment in Indian online travel venture ibibo Group.\n\n* Renewed JSE cautionaries by MTN and MTN Zakhele.\n\n* The appointment of Duarte da Silva as non-executive chairman of the Huge Group.\n\n* The resignation of Vincent Mokholo, non-executive chairman of the Huge Group (stays on as a director).\n\nKey African news\n\n* MTN has paid Nigerian authorities $250 million (R3.8 billion) in a \"good faith payment\" as a move towards settling its hefty fine in the West African nation.

William Shakespeare once said in one of his famous plays (Julius Caesar), \"Men at some time are masters of their fates; the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.\" When you know your worth, no one can make you feel worthless. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself. If you don't find your place in life, you will be displaced. Almost three thousand years ago, Israel's richest king, King Solomon, gave a controversial and unconventional path to wealth. The richest king that ever lived once said, \"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\"\n\nOne Spring, over hundred and fifty years ago, a young and handsome man named James was employed by a rich American farmer, Worthy Taylor, to work on his farm and also assist him in other household chores. The farmer knew nothing much about the boy except that his name was James, but he gave him a job. James spent the winter cutting stove wood, bringing in the cows and making himself generally useful. He ate in the kitchen and slept in the hayloft. Before the summer was over, James had fallen in love with Taylor's daughter, though the master liked the boy and his work, he was compelled to dispense with his services because James had fallen irredeemably in love with his beautiful daughter. The farmer hated and abhorred the idea of his daughter marrying a mere farm-hand coupled with the fact that he had no money, no name, and very poor prospects. Thirty-five years passed before Taylor one day pulled down his farmstead to make way for a new one. On the rafters above the hayloft he discovered that his former help had carved his full name. His name? James A. Garfield. He was then the president of the United States! James Garfield eventually became the 20th President of the United States of America. A man who was thought to be a nonentity and unworthy of a rich man's daughter eventually became the most powerful man on earth. Taylor lost the opportunity of becoming the father-In-law to the President but more sympathetically made his daughter lose forever the opportunity of ever becoming the First Lady of the United States.\n\nDon't define people by where they are, you never know where God is taking them to! One of the mysteries of life is in how we find fame in the unlikeliest of places and situations. The geometric rise of Olajumoke Orisaguna from the slum of Agege in the city Lagos to international limelight sounds like one of the fairy tale stories in fictional books. It has been a mixed form of reaction from many Nigerians, while some have fumed bitterly about her sudden rise to fame, some embraced it totally as an act of God while others in their 'lazy mode' have coveted a similitude of jumoke's fortune. Some few weeks ago, no search engines would have recognized the name \"Orisaguna\", infact the closest response would have been the word 'error' or probably suggest a more popular alternative for the search. Surprisingly, as at the time I was writing this piece, a tap of the name \"Orisaguna\" on Google brought up 671,000 inexhaustible results! Olajumoke woke up on that fateful day like any other, she strapped a tray loaded with bread and walked the streets of Agege like she always did and to her, it was just like any other day but in the placing of divine arrangement, her casual act of walking and hawking eventually became her straight walk into fame and glory. At a time of deep economic and financial struggle, a woman found her own 'break' in the midst of dwindling national fortune. There are special encounters that are divinely orchestrated to abruptly and precipitously skyrocket men from complete obscurity to lofty and unimaginable heights. Such was the meeting between T.Y Bello and Olajumoke.\n\nOlajumoke was a trained hair stylist from Ire in Osun State while her husband works as a sliding door installer in the same village. Life in Osun state was full of struggle and unprofitable labour to the extent that she couldn't afford the ceremonial passing out ritual commonly referred to as 'freedom' to start her own salon. At the invitation of a friend in Lagos, she decided to give hawking of bread a trial. Leaving behind her husband and her 5-year-old child, she decided to face another phase of her life with her 14-month-old daughter strapped behind her back. Working tediously from 2.30pm to 11.00pm everyday selling bread to eke out a living, Jumoke ended up virtually every day making less than $20, with a meagre and paltry profit of around $1. A vivid description was given by T.Y Bello of how the 27- year old bread seller literally walked into the 'Hall of Fame', the renowned photographer captioned it a 'phenomenal story' of being at the right place at the right time. T.Y Bello was taking photos of Nigerian-born British musician, Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, popularly known as Tinie Tempah in Nigeria recently when a woman selling bread happened to unintentionally walked into her shot: \"She seemed a little confused, some people were asking her to walk past really quickly, others were asking her to stay, she was just in limbo. I asked if it is okay to take her photograph and she nodded Ok. I didn't think I made a great image, but once I posted the shots on social media, interest in Jumoke exploded. When the photographs landed for the first time on social media, everyone immediately thought she was a model. No one believed she just walked past. It occurred to me that if everyone thought she should be a model then maybe she should be one, then the search for her began\"\n\nOlajumoke was full of joy and tears as her magical breakthrough seemingly looks unreal, but nevertheless managed to speak during an interview with CNN's Stephanie Busari, \"I never expected that this could ever happen to me. My friends have told me they saw me on T.V and they are really happy. My parents cannot believe their own child can become such a success. They are happy.\" Olajumoke, who is said to have little or no knowledge of English Language, has been offered admission to study proficiency in English Grammar and Communication, and One-on-One Total Personality Development at Poise Graduate Finishing Academy. With the guidance and help of T.Y, Olajumoke has scored some modelling contracts, a luxury home and a fully paid scholarship to complete her education. Stanbic IBTC under the Stanbic IBTC Education Trust Fund has offered to pay for her two children (Precious and Grace) aged five and one, until University age. She has become the new face of Payporte and some other top corporate brands.\n\nMan is a product of encounters and God will only raise men through men. T.Y Bello saw her when she was still invincible to the world. We all need someone at every junction of our lives to help us rediscover our self-image and identity in moments of crisis. The greatest treasure of life is the gift of people that will never give up on us regardless of any situation; people that will inspire a healthy self-image in us. T.Y has a special gift that we seldom find in many people, she has a way of seeing the beauty in others. What a monumental beauty that would have been wasted if T.Y Bello was unable to see a model in the bread seller!\n\n\"The sign of a beautiful person is that they always see beauty in others.\"-Omar Suleiman\n\nI really want to use this platform in reaching out to the youths. Don't ever allow your condition to determine your destination and if you have 'bought' that lie that you'll never amount to anything, the truth is that: YOUR LIFE IS BIG - far bigger than you've ever imagined!

Koh two years ago tossed out an effort to win class-action status for a lawsuit accusing Google of violating the privacy terms of email users. The same year, she rejected a $324 million settlement in a lawsuit alleging Google and Apple conspired with other technology companies to restrict employee recruiting.\n\nBefore serving as a federal judge in 2010, Koh was appointed to a California judgeship by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nShe has also served as a federal prosecutor and worked for law firms.", "Best Bets: The menu changes frequently, but get the quail, a fish dish and whatever vegetables are available; potted meats are also great.\n\nJonathan Gushue spent a year in search of a Toronto toehold, touring unloved oyster houses and abandoned hotel restaurants, stalking Ossington and Roncesvalles and the downtown core for an even halfway-workable building, fielding offers and figures that invariably felt absurd. Toronto restaurant real estate was only trouble, but still Mr. Gushue persisted. The city, he then assumed, was the place for a chef of his ambition. He had flamed out, and badly, a couple of years earlier - he had gone missing for nearly two weeks, after a dinner service at Cambridge, Ont.'s Langdon Hall, where Mr. Gushue had been known as one of Canada's most important culinary stars. In Toronto, he figured, he could at long last re-emerge.\n\nBut in January last year a contact at the city of Kitchener called him. There was a great old space available in a soon-to-be prime part of the city's downtown, near where Google, Facebook and Square were setting up. It had 20-foot ceilings and a working kitchen and room for 120 customers, as well as space for 70 more upstairs. Kitchener, as Mr. Gushue knew, was surrounded with small, innovative farms and underappreciated food producers. The price for that space was practically a song.\n\nMr. Gushue and his business partner, a front-of-house veteran named Ryan Lloyd-Craig, leapt at the opportunity. And with the Berlin, the market-driven, live-fire restaurant they finally opened this past December, Kitchener has scored a major coup, as has Mr. Gushue. Though imperfect still, the restaurant is one of the most ambitious, faith-restoring - and at its best, exhilarating - restaurants to open lately, whether in Kitchener, Toronto or anywhere in between.\n\nThe menu is built around whatever Mr. Gushue's suppliers bring him: quails one week and a whole pig the next; fresh cream they use to make butter and buttermilk; pickerel, long winter leeks and always cabbages, as a nod to the area's German-Mennonite past. One day not long ago they got 180 geese, which the Berlin's kitchen turned into country terrines and confit legs. They roasted the breasts over the wood-burning fire, then served them over smoked beets and orange slices, balanced over spiced-honey broth.\n\nMr. Gushue's cooking here is German, roughly, but lighter and more vegetable-forward than you might expect. It is executed a lot of the time with skill and judgment that are impossible to fake. And nearly every dish is in some way touched by his kitchen's roaring grill, a two-grate number with crank-wheels for raising and lowering - almost every bite twigs campfire memories.\n\nThe Berlin's quail, for instance, are grilled hard and fast over the hottest part of the fire, and then left to rest on an upper rack, bathing in the woodsmoke. They come out sublimely fire-charred and gamey-flavoured, just flecked with salt and rosemary. Mr. Gushue serves the birds with fresh apple chutney and impossibly creamy celeriac pur\u00e9e that's tart and cool and finished with house-made paprika.\n\nThe chef roasts onions, leeks and buttermilk-marinated cabbage quarters directly in the coals until they're soft and sweet - the humblest of vegetables, smelted into revelation. His menu makes for hunger-taunting reading.\n\n\"Long Winter Leeks with Bacon and Fris\u00e9e Salad, Pont-l'Ev\u00eaque on Toast, Belgian Endive and Sherry Vinaigrette, $14.\"\n\n\"Grilled Pickerel, Apricot Pur\u00e9e, Charred Cabbage, Buttermilk and Potato Sauce, $27.\"\n\n\"Wild Striped Bass, Creamed Salsify, Coal Roasted Onion, Crushed Herb Sauce, $28.\"\n\nAnd all of it is made the hard way. While many chefs preach fresh and local and the importance of small-scale agriculture, Mr. Gushue and his nine-person kitchen team live it, daily. They make their own butter and the restaurant's sublime, whole-grain breads; they butcher and cure the meats and prowl the Kitchener-Waterloo region for great suppliers; they even make their own root beer, tonic, lemon soda and cola here.\n\nAnd while many high-end places, such as Blue Hill, in New York, and Eigensinn Farm, in Ontario cottage country, do this sort of thing for the precious few, almost anyone can afford to eat at the Berlin. The restaurant's tables are ringed with extended families and young, rosy-cheeked couples, with tech workers, shopkeepers and farmers in their winter boots.\n\nWhich some might see as a come-down for a chef who has only ever worked in four-star kitchens, Mr. Gushue sees it differently. \"The biggest thing is the people really want us to be here,\" he said on the phone this week. A moment later: \"No one cares if they're sitting on a $900 chair or eating off a $300 plate.\" The restaurant often fills up by 6 p.m. on weeknights. The scene here is at once cool and refreshingly uncool.\n\nMr. Gushue, who is 45, has one of the best r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the business. He trained at Toronto's Four Seasons Hotel, and then at a high-end resort outside Tokyo, before moving on to the two-star Michelin dining room at London's Berkeley Hotel. Back in Canada, he was the chef at Truffles at the Four Seasons, at a time when it was one of the most important restaurants in Toronto. He stayed for three years before decamping to Langdon Hall, where his kitchen nudged itself onto the all-important World's Best Restaurants list.\n\nThe chef's blow-up, in December, 2012, seemed to come out of nowhere, but for the circle around him, it wasn't entirely a surprise. He'd been struggling with alcoholism. The year before, he had done some time in rehab. That night in December, Mr. Gushue was charged with driving under the influence. It was his second time. He disappeared, and drank himself oblivious, as his name and picture appeared in newspapers and screens across the country. He had left a wife and three young kids at home. He was found nearly two weeks later. He has been sober ever since, he said.\n\nThe Berlin's leek salad one night recently was a taste of the chef at his best: The alliums buttery-soft and smoky-sweet, served with bracingly bitter greens and a fat slice of Pont-l'Ev\u00eaque cheese on toast. The seasoning, from pork fat and salt and good sherry vinegar, was applied with a master's touch. That fire-roasted cabbage, too, was a thing of beauty. It had mellowed in the coals and then been glazed in a pan with butter and vegetable stock. The perfect piece of pickerel it came with, seared on that same fire so its skin was cracker-crisp and its centre translucent-medium, would have been the standout at any other restaurant. Here, beside that exquisite cabbage and a summery daub of apricot pur\u00e9e, it almost struggled to compete.\n\nThe Berlin's beef is grass-fed, from a young, local farmer who also does their ducks and geese. He delivers a cow to the restaurant every six weeks, give or take. The ribeye I had was beautiful one night - all in-your-face beefy flavour, subtle fat and the taste of fire - but a little less nice the next time. That is the nature of local, grass-fed, cut-from-the-whole-animal beef steaks.\n\nThe fish, whether that pickerel or the striped bass, or the fat, dense fillets of monkfish on the menu a few weeks ago, were uniformly perfect. The potted duck and rabbit were excellent, too.\n\nWhat the Berlin now needs to nail down is the hardest thing in professional cooking: consistency. Where one night it verged on a four-star showing, another night's meal, and particularly its appetizers, was less impressive. The leeks this time were served much too cold, and the seasoning on nearly everything had been applied too meekly. The desserts, apart from the superb burnt lemon curd, could use some polish. (Also, enough with the root-vegetable ice creams, please. Only pastry chefs like root-vegetable ice cream.) The room, too, is so enormous that its front end, near Kitchener's King Street, can feel forlorn sometimes; its servers, though always friendly, are too often stretched too thin.\n\nAll of these issues are fixable, though, and given Mr. Gushue's training, I expect he'll do that in time. In the meantime, it is nearly enough that the chef is back, and that Kitchener has notched the win.", "Though sky-high real estate drove Jonathan Gushue down the 401, the chef's new venture is one of the most ambitious anywhere\n\nPhotos by Jennifer Roberts for The Globe and Mail.

He defended the company's unbending stand by saying: \"These are the right things to do.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the FBI unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a murderous extremist in San Bernardino.\n\nFederal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. But Apple contends the order would force it to write a program that would make other iPhones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals.\n\nTech companies are rallying to Apple's cause, and now plan a joint \"friend of the court\" brief on its behalf. Facebook said it will join with Google, Twitter and Microsoft on a court filing. A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file several briefs.\n\nApple filed court papers on Thursday that asked federal Magistrate Sheri Pym to reverse her order on the grounds that the government had no legal authority to force the company to weaken the security of its own products. The company accused the government of seeking \"dangerous power\" through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nThe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing that 51 percent of Americans think Apple should help the government unlock the iPhone.\n\nBut it's unclear how the controversy might affect Apple's business. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most Americans think about Apple or its products.\n\nCook offered only brief remarks about the FBI case, and most questions from shareholders concerned other aspects of Apple's business. But the CEO won praise during the meeting from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Internet rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\"We applaud your leadership,\" said Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. \"I recall the FBI wiretapping Dr. King in the civil rights movement. We cannot go down this path again. Some of us do remember the days of (former FBI director J. Edgar) Hoover and McCarthy and Nixon and enemies lists.\"", "HOWARD - Wednesday was National Tortilla Chip day, as good a reason as any for the 135 accountants and business consultants at Wipfli's office to have a little fun.\n\nThe staff has been asked to wear tennis shoes to work to get into the spirit of Leap Day, though someone might have to remind Wipfli Partner Dan Pichler to wear his on Monday.\n\nLeap Day, Tortilla Chip Day, Dress Down Fridays, Community Day and other such events are the work of the office's Fun Committee, just one element of Wipfli's efforts to transform how it recruits and retains employees.\n\nWipfli has also replaced annual reviews with a system of instant feedback. The company supports employees' involvement in nonprofits and implemented flexible scheduling to try to encourage that engagement. The efforts earned the firm the Next Generation Best Place to Work Award at this year's Future 15 Awards, sponsored by Current, the Greater Green Bay Chamber's young professionals organization.\n\nPichler said the company faces heavy competition for young accountants and business consultants and noticed that it was losing too many 20-something and 30-something employees after five to seven years with the firm. In the past year or two, the company has made a lot of changes to its marketing, hiring practices and workplace culture to stem the flow.\n\n\"Our job is to make the environment attractive, so our employees want to grow with us,\" PIchler said. \"We need to create an entire package of workplace culture to help retain talent. We've looked for ideas on how to get better and used them to develop a culture we feel people want to stay and be a part of.\"\n\nCurrent Manager Brian Johnson said Wipfli and the other 10 nominees for this year's Best Place to Work Award share some common traits in their efforts to create engaging, attractive workplaces. He said they don't do it with foosball tables, X-Boxes and juice bars.\n\n\"Don't try to turn your business into Google. It doesn't work,\" Johnson said. \"It's about the policies more than the things.\"\n\nHere are four ways companies have found success rising to the recruitment and retention challenge:\n\n\" Don't try to be Google: The office rec rooms, coffee bars, free rides to work and other perks get attention, but local employers say it's a mistake to think installing a foosball table in the break room is the answer.\n\nAt Prophit Marketing, a Best Place to Work nominee on Broadway in Green Bay, Brander-In-Chief Joe Kiedinger said what companies like Google and Zappos do well is to seek to understand who an employee is before they decide if she is the right fit for the job.\n\n\"You have to be who you are, not Google,\" he said. \"We like to find roles that match our people's God-given talents and skill sets.\"\n\n\" Help them integrate: Hiring a new employee is just the start of the process of getting them up to speed on their new workplace and community.\n\n\"It's hugely important to integrate the person into the community,\" Johnson said. \"These businesses care about what's going on in their personal life.\"\n\nWipfli Senior Human Resources Generalist Tina Johnson said the company works closely with new hires as they integrate into the company and community. She said the company's new instant feedback program, My Performance, provides ongoing assessment so that all employees can adjust in real time instead of waiting for an annual evaluation.\n\n\"Associates and managers can request feedback so they can improve today, not months down the road,\" she said. \"There's a free flow of information back and forth.\"\n\n\" Give them purpose: A new employee, of course, won't be given the biggest account or most important client right away. But he said the more meaningful work younger employees are assigned, the more part of the team they feel.\n\n\"Make sure at least part of their job is dedicated to meaningful things,\" Johnson said.\n\nKiedinger said understanding an employee's personal motivations and interests helps him determine who can best take on new roles and responsibilities when they arise at Prophit.\n\n\"The millennials, as employees, are purpose-driven,\" Kiedinger said. \"Companies that communicate great let their employees know where they fit in the context of the company, not just their role to play. As you understand employees' motivations, you can work to reduce turnover. It's all about communication.\"\n\n\" Encourage engagement: Johnson said young professionals blur the line between work and life where prior generations sought to balance them. He said perks like flexible work scheduling give employees time for family and community.\n\n\"Give young professionals flexibility and they'll work all night,\" Johnson said.\n\nKiedinger said engagement begins during the hiring process at Prophit Marketing and doesn't really stop.\n\n\"When you match an employees' motivations with the job role, you get instant engagement,\" Kiedinger said. \"Not only will they be superior at the job, but they will be engaged in it.\"\n\nPichler said Wipfli encourages employees to volunteer at nonprofits and community organizations they strongly support without forcing it.\n\n\"If you care about an organization, we want you to demonstrate your passion,\" he said. \"It reflects back on Wipfli.\"\n\nThe whole staff also participates in Community Day each year, during which the company's offices shut down for a day so employees can volunteer together. Employees at multiple locations contributed more than 4,600 hours to nonprofits last year.\n\n\"Community Day is a magical formula of community service, people learning about a nonprofit, the community learning about Wipfli, getting something done and getting employees to interact with colleagues that otherwise might not know each other,\" Pichler said. \"It produces memorable days and a lot of good stories.\"\n\njbollier@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @GBstreetwise.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/210CDTE", "This year has seen rise to free-speech movements in universities. The practice of no-platforming and the setting up of safe spaces has received much criticism from student societies as well as by national newspapers. Students at LSE have even taken to set up a society, the LSESU Speakeasy, after their university was ranked as among the most censorious in the recently-published Free Speech University Rankings. Earlier this month, the Guardian entered the debate, asking whether a university should be a \"safe space\" for all or a place where anything can be debated, in response to the comedian Kate Smurthwaite's Goldsmiths show being cancelled after student protest. As a Muslim student, I witness first-hand the limitations free speech restrictions can impose on day-to-day campus life. And at the end of the day, whether you agree or disagree with these movements, it does not change the fact that some people have the luxury of campaigning for free speech, while others do not.\n\nThe 'war on terror' and the situation in the Middle East has politicised Islam to the extent that the government has grown suspicious of its 2.7 million Muslim population. Recently there has been much discussion about the repercussions of the government's 'Prevent' legislation. Its parameters have become so ambiguous that almost any action can be scrutinised as a basis for radicalisation. Educational authorities are expected to keep an eye on students that are 'at risk of being drawn to terrorism'. The government has put so much pressure on educational staff to spot out signs of radicalisations that it's even led to the labelling of a three year old. Even simple criticisms of the UK's foreign policy can be construed as a 'sign of radicalisation'. When our own Prime Minister labelled those who didn't support the Syria airstrikes as 'terrorist sympathisers', it is at this point that free speech became less of an issue about offending people and more about being seen as a security threat.\n\nAs well as the personalised inspection, university societies also face much tighter regulations on who they can bring on campus and who can't to speak for Islamic events or debates. New legislations has now made educational institutions accountable for staging speakers that might say something 'problematic'. Even those who are 'non-violent extremists', those who are not advocating violence themselves, are indicted as well. I myself have had the experience of being asked by a member of staff to withdraw my invitation to a speaker to come because of the fear of being affected by this new law. Often, it is because the authorities have done a Google search on the speaker and have found that a single article labels him as an extremist. By its very nature, anyone on the internet can label you something without your consent, and any self-acclaimed Muslim speaker will almost inevitably have been called an extremist at some point along the line. The process is more troublesome because, as an organiser, you find yourself in danger of being associated with the 'extreme views' the authorities sought to block out. This results in an aversion among Muslims to set up discussions on topical issues due to the fear of being implicated. And this effectively is silence through censorship.\n\nWhile all these free speech movements deal with student unions or societies, they still do not have to grapple with the university administration in the way Muslims have to. The struggle Muslims face against free speech, due to increasing governmental surveillance, is more structural and institutionalised than any protest 'against the system'. The consequences of campaigning for free speech are more severe because it can led to monitoring, blacklisting and other limits to your own freedom. It is little wonder that few are brave enough to make that stand.\n\nFree speech means very little if you do not stand up for everyone affected. None of these movements have spoken about how Muslims are being affected too. The justification of censorship for security and how it is limiting religious expression needs to be addressed. Otherwise it will just retain the status quo: while some people have free speech, Muslims will always have a higher price to pay.", "Speaking to the BBC from a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Shanghai, Mr Osborne warned: \"The storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy and that has a consequence for lots of countries including Britain. Now, we are weathering it better than most but we've just had confirmation that our own economy is not as big as we had hoped.\n\n\"So we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford and we will address that in the Budget, because I'm absolutely clear we've got to root our county in the principle that we must live within our means and we have economic security.\"\n\nThe Chancellor pointed out how the first place he might look to would be \"further efficiencies in government\".\n\nHe added: \"There are always ways to make government better, always ways to make sure that the taxes of people are better spent.\"\n\nJohn McDonnell for Labour jumped on his remarks, describing them as a \"total humiliation for floundering George Osborne\".\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor said: \"He has sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months: that his recovery is built on sand. Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world.\"\n\nMr McDonnell argued that if the Chancellor had been doing his job properly he would have been collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers.\n\n\"Instead, he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures. Labour and a growing coalition that now includes the OECD and the IMF are calling for an economy based on increased investment. The truth is that the biggest risk to the British economy is George Osborne,\" he added.\n\nOfficial figures show the size of the economy is one per cent or \u00a318 billion smaller than previously thought.\n\nLast November, better than expected tax receipts and lower debt interest payments improved the public finances by \u00a327bn, enabling Mr Osborne to ease back on planned cuts to tax credits and to confirm he would deliver a \u00a310bn surplus by the time of the 2020 election.\n\nHowever, since then the global outlook, fuelled by weaker Chinese growth, has become bleaker.\n\nThe Chancellor has yet to hear the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment ahead of his March Budget but slowing economic growth and falling tax receipts could mean a gloomier forecast for 2016 and beyond.", "I was prepared for anything. I've been at Apple shareholder meetings -- O K, I'm dating myself here -- when investors stormed the citadel and called for the CEO's head.\n\nApple investors at the annual meeting on Friday might have demanded the company break open the iPhone for the FBI, the controversy that has embroiled the company for the past two weeks, and move past this distraction to other projects that could improve the bottom line: conquering new markets (India) and launching new products (the rumored Apple car), to name two.\n\nInstead, the 200 or so shareholders cheered Tim Cook, who in turn thanked them for their support over the past two weeks. It must have been a good feeling for Cook after all the heat he has gotten from law enforcement, politicians and average citizens who wonder why the company is taking a stand over an issue involving a terrorist case.\n\nIf he is feeling the pressure of \"being in the news lately,\" as he put it in an understated way, Cook didn't show it.\n\n\"We are a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety,\" said Cook, casually perched on a stool with his iPad at the ready. \"We do these (things) because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn't scare us.\"\n\nCook's appearance in front of shareholders capped quite a week for the company.\n\nApple is caught in a war of words with the FBI and the U.S. government over the encryption of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino assailants responsible for the death of 14 people and the serious injury of 22 in December.\n\nThe dispute was the topic of a congressional hearing this week and even became part of the GOP presidential debate Thursday night. The company has received the support of key tech companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google.\n\nAlso Thursday, Apple responded to a court order that it comply with the FBI's request to help law enforcement gain access to the phone's contents. Apple said that forcing the company to write software to hack the phone was a form of \"compelled speech,\" among other arguments, claiming that Apple was entitled to First Amendment protections.\n\nCook made a 30-minute appearance this week on ABC News defending the company's stance, sounding populist themes about protecting our digital privacy.\n\nThere, in trying to make a point about how serious the situation is, Cook compared cracking the iPhone's protections to writing the \"software equivalent of cancer.\"\n\nI thought that metaphor, which he repeated several times, was a rare misstep on Cook's part. Hyperbole, as we know from watching the GOP presidential candidates debate, can be very useful.\n\nBut Apple has to be extremely careful how it portrays this dilemma -- and overstating the situation can backfire both in court and in the court of public opinion. So far, people are roughly divided evenly in support of Apple and the FBI, polls show.\n\nAnd meanwhile, there are plenty of other pressure point for Apple, which, after all, is a global company with a lot at stake.\n\nAt the annual meeting, shareholders held forth about other topics such as how retail stores could better serve the business community and Apple's future in China and India. Apple has big hopes for India, was Cook's message.\n\nWhen will the new campus be finished, one person asked: January 2017.\n\n\"Steve spent the last couple years of his life really dedicating himself to that project. It will be the center of innovation for years to come,\" Cook said, referring to Apple co-founder and former chief executive, Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd is Apple making an iCar?\n\nCook: \"Remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting and you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? It's going to be Christmas Eve for awhile.\"\n\nShareholders voted down a proposal asking the company to accelerate the recruitment process of senior leadership in order to make those ranks more diverse.\n\nBut even the Rev. Jesse Jackson of the RainbowPush Coalition didn't dwell on diversity and tech, one of his top issues.\n\nInstead, he applauded the company for its stance in its running battle with the FBI, saying there has to be a way that supports \"personal freedom and privacy and supports the needs of law enforcement and national security.\" He evoked an era in U.S. history when law enforcement created an enemies list of civil rights leaders who were monitored.\n\n\"Those who have no regard for human rights, if they have the power to order a company to open up files, there are no limits,\" Jackson told me.\n\nCook did his job well on Friday, projecting a quiet calm and unwavering commitment to the issue. I hope he had a chance to savor the moment.\n\nOther venues Cook may go to in the coming months won't be as friendly.", "Last year, Google made a promise to provide regular security updates to keep their major Nexus devices safe.

We're not exactly sure what Samsung officially considers their flagships, but generally any high-end model from 2014 and beyond seems to fit the bill. We can look to past updates to get a good idea of which models should see this security patch. The Galaxy S4 didn't make the cut, it seems, but Galaxy S5 and all variants of the Galaxy S6 did.

He is in good humour, but wants to come home.\"\n\n(It is good to know that after about 15 years being stuck in space, Abacha is in good humour.)\n\nHere's the important part.\n\n\"In the 14 years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost US$15,000,000,\" wrote the Astronautics project manager.\n\n\"This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost US$3,000,000. In order to access his trust fund, we need your assistance.\"\n\nTo cut the story short, Dr Tunde needs US$3mil to retrieve the US$15mil accumulated salary of his stuck-in-space cousin. However, he needs a bank account to retrieve the US$15mil because he and his NASRDA colleagues \"as civil ser\u00advants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating fo\u00adreign accounts in our names\".\n\nNeedless to say, wrote Dr Tunde, the trust reposed on me at this juncture is enormous.\n\nIn return for me allowing them to use my account, he and his colleagues have agreed to offer me 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction.\n\n\"You will be mandated to remit the balance 70% to other accounts in due course,\" he wrote. \"Kindly expedite action as we are behind sche\u00addule to enable us to include down payment in this financial quarter.\"\n\nI'm planning to do a noble deed and bring the stuck Nigerian astronaut back to earth. I'll allow Dr Tunde to use my bank account in order to retrieve the US$15mil. The US$3mil that I'll make from this deal will be incidental.\n\nPsst ... the Bangladeshis are coming to Malaysia (despite Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announcing that the Government has decided to suspend the recruitment of all fo\u00adreign workers to Malaysia, inclu\u00adding those from Bangladesh.)\n\nI know this as a fact as trusted friends (who have degrees) have shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter photographs of foreigners (who look like they may or may not be Bangladeshis) arriving in KLIA and images of the daily arrival of flights from Dhaka to KLIA.\n\nAnd I don't believe the Immi\u00adgra\u00adtion Department's explanation on Facebook that the photographs uploaded to social media were ac\u00ad\u00adtually the screening process done by the KLIA enforcement unit to check passengers who were not genuine visitors.\n\nI believe my friends who say that these photographs are proof that the Bangladeshis are coming and they eventually will become 1.5 million voters for Barisan Nasional to win GE14.\n\nIf Malaysians can fall for the \"Bangladeshis are coming\" fake social media report, I won't be surprise if they fall for the Nigerian astronaut scam. Perhaps my comparison of the Nigerian scam with the Bangladeshis fake report is over the top, but you get my drift.\n\nHere's how misinformation is spread online.\n\nThe World Economic Forum website recently ran an interview with Walter Quattrociocchi, the head of the Laboratory of Compu\u00adtational Social Science at IMT Lucca in Italy, who has been studying the phenomenon of misinformation online.\n\n\"People are looking for information which will confirm their existing beliefs. If today an article comes out from the WHO supporting your claims, you like it and share it. If tomorrow a new one comes out contradicting your claims, you criticise it, question it,\" Quattrociocchi said.\n\n\"But couldn't we combat that by spreading better information?\" World Economic Forum asked.\n\n\"No. In fact, there is evidence that this only makes things worse,\" he said.\n\n\"We found that people interested in a conspiracy theory are likely to become more involved in the conversation when exposed to 'debunking'.\n\n\"In other words, the more the exposure to contrasting information a person is given, the more it reinforces their consumption pattern. Debunking within an echo chamber can backfire, and reinforce people's bias.\"\n\nMisinformation online is very difficult to correct, according to Quattrociocchi.\n\n\"Confirmation bias is extremely powerful. Once people have found 'evidence' of their views, external and contradicting versions are simply ignored,\" he said.", "\"I know which election I'm focusing on.

If you are sick, go to the doctor is a programmed behavior. I am not saying some doctors do not help, I am saying it is a PRACTICE of medicine and some doctors help while other doctors don't. Should you go to the doctor is one question but who should treat or cure you thereafter is another. Most people figure the answers are one and the same, but that is not always true.\n\nIf you trust someone else with your life, it will come out the way they want it to, not the way you hoped it would. Can you afford to take that risk?\n\nWe make assumptions about doctors and the medical industry that are not always correct, sometimes yes but always - no. We make the assumption that the doctor knows everything necessary to address and fix your condition. But we forget it is the PRACTICE of medicine, doctors are always learning, new procedures are always being developed and some doctors are not as up to date on the latest methods, cures and treatments as you might think. And the New England Journal of Medicine takes over a year to come out in print, all the while breakthroughs are happening that will not be in the next edition of the \"doctor's Bible'.\n\nIt is interesting that the medical industry symbol is two poisonous snakes wrapped around a stick. We can put a probe around Pluto, send people to Mars in 2021, clone animals and choose the gender of an unborn child, but doctors cannot cure much of anything? Not so!\n\nWe make the assumption that our health is the doctor's top priority. But unfortunately his/her family is top priority, which means his or her practice and the money that it makes is a higher priority than you are. Furthermore, it is our personal responsibility to look after ourselves and take care of our bodies, not the primary responsibility of the doctor. This means we cannot simply eat like we want, smoke whatever we want, drink whatever we want, fail to exercise, stress out and avoid getting enough rest then run to the doctor expecting him or her to fix what we screwed up. If you do not take care of your body, it will in fact let you know that it is being mistreated. And if you are expecting the government to do the right thing, look at Flint, MI.\n\nYOUR HEALTH IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY\n\nWe make the assumption that the medical industry will cure us, yet most of what we see is a bag of treatment tricks that never cure anything, pharmaceutical medications that have side effects worse than the original condition and processes like chemotherapy that often weaken the patient to the point of death. These are the facts, like them or not.\n\nWe make the assumption that the medical industry is here to help us live better, live longer and be cured of disease. Yet they do not share or promote cures for AIDS, diabetes, cancer and so many other diseases. Holistic professionals or homeopathic doctors are even looked down by their peers and the medical industry. Yet the doctors keep writing prescriptions and bombarding us with radiation while the pharmaceutical industry keeps giving us poisons that tamper with our immune systems, brains, hearts, blood pressure, lungs and everything else. A little research on the \"side effects\" of the medication often prescribed will prove this to be undeniably true.\n\nWe once were at the mercy of what the doctors told us, but now that we have computers, Google and the power to search the world for hidden answers, wake up, use it and save yourself.\n\nWhile behavioral programming is teaching us to keep right on trusting in doctors who are not curing us and prescription medications that are in fact killing us, we act as if we are asleep and as if doctors walk on water. Well it's time to wake up, stop being lazy and do your homework.\n\nI am not saying never go to the doctor, I am saying the doctor should be one option - not the only option and sometimes not the first or best option. Know all of your options.\n\nI often shake my head as I see the pink ribbons for breast cancer and the AIDS walks. Why? Because the medical industry knows exactly where these diseases are coming from and they do nothing to stop it. That is pure negligence. The FDA, the CDC, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health know exactly what is going on and they stand by and let it happen. They know the deadly dangers of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nFor more information, email me at brainstormonline@yahoo.com\n\nThe medical and pharmaceutical industries know how to cure a great many diseases. But they say and do nothing because they make more money by treating patients than by curing them. They know cancer is coming from pesticides, insecticides, growth hormones in food, Aspertame (in NutraSweet and Equal) in diet sodas, Johnson and Johnson baby powder, GMOs, fluorides in your toothpaste but they do nothing about it and you stay asleep unto death.

WAKE UP PEOPLE and realize that you have been programmed! Do the research for yourself because the answers are often found in what your doctor may not tell you. Stop completely and blindly trusting people with your life who do not have you as their top priority. You must be your own top priority.

And live.", "I was prepared for anything. I've been at Apple shareholder meetings -- O K, I'm dating myself here -- when investors stormed the citadel and called for the CEO's head.\n\nApple investors at the annual meeting on Friday might have demanded the company break open the iPhone for the FBI, the controversy that has embroiled the company for the past two weeks, and move past this distraction to other projects that could improve the bottom line: conquering new markets (India) and launching new products (the rumored Apple car), to name two.\n\nInstead, the 200 or so shareholders cheered Tim Cook, who in turn thanked them for their support over the past two weeks. It must have been a good feeling for Cook after all the heat he has gotten from law enforcement, politicians and average citizens who wonder why the company is taking a stand over an issue involving a terrorist case.\n\nIf he is feeling the pressure of \"being in the news lately,\" as he put it in an understated way, Cook didn't show it.\n\n\"We are a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety,\" said Cook, casually perched on a stool with his iPad at the ready. \"We do these (things) because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn't scare us.\"\n\nCook's appearance in front of shareholders capped quite a week for the company.\n\nApple is caught in a war of words with the FBI and the U.S. government over the encryption of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino assailants responsible for the death of 14 people and the serious injury of 22 in December.\n\nThe dispute was the topic of a congressional hearing this week and even became part of the GOP presidential debate Thursday night. The company has received the support of key tech companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google.\n\nAlso Thursday, Apple responded to a court order that it comply with the FBI's request to help law enforcement gain access to the phone's contents. Apple said that forcing the company to write software to hack the phone was a form of \"compelled speech,\" among other arguments, claiming that Apple was entitled to First Amendment protections.\n\nCook made a 30-minute appearance this week on ABC News defending the company's stance, sounding populist themes about protecting our digital privacy.\n\nThere, in trying to make a point about how serious the situation is, Cook compared cracking the iPhone's protections to writing the \"software equivalent of cancer.\"\n\nI thought that metaphor, which he repeated several times, was a rare misstep on Cook's part. Hyperbole, as we know from watching the GOP presidential candidates debate, can be very useful.\n\nBut Apple has to be extremely careful how it portrays this dilemma -- and overstating the situation can backfire both in court and in the court of public opinion. So far, people are roughly divided evenly in support of Apple and the FBI, polls show.\n\nAnd meanwhile, there are plenty of other pressure point for Apple, which, after all, is a global company with a lot at stake.\n\nAt the annual meeting, shareholders held forth about other topics such as how retail stores could better serve the business community and Apple's future in China and India. Apple has big hopes for India, was Cook's message.\n\nWhen will the new campus be finished, one person asked: January 2017.\n\n\"Steve spent the last couple years of his life really dedicating himself to that project. It will be the center of innovation for years to come,\" Cook said, referring to Apple co-founder and former chief executive, Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd is Apple making an iCar?\n\nCook: \"Remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting and you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? It's going to be Christmas Eve for awhile.\"\n\nShareholders voted down a proposal asking the company to accelerate the recruitment process of senior leadership in order to make those ranks more diverse.\n\nBut even the Rev. Jesse Jackson of the RainbowPush Coalition didn't dwell on diversity and tech, one of his top issues.\n\nInstead, he applauded the company for its stance in its running battle with the FBI, saying there has to be a way that supports \"personal freedom and privacy and supports the needs of law enforcement and national security.\" He evoked an era in U.S. history when law enforcement created an enemies list of civil rights leaders who were monitored.\n\n\"Those who have no regard for human rights, if they have the power to order a company to open up files, there are no limits,\" Jackson told me.\n\nCook did his job well on Friday, projecting a quiet calm and unwavering commitment to the issue. I hope he had a chance to savor the moment.\n\nOther venues Cook may go to in the coming months won't be as friendly.", "The following censorship instructions, issued to the media by government authorities, have been leaked and distributed online.

He defended the company's unbending stance by saying: \"These are the right things to do.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the FBI unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a murderous extremist in San Bernardino, California.\n\nFederal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. But Apple contends the order would force it to write a software program that would make other iPhones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals in the future.\n\nMajor tech companies are rallying to Apple's cause, and now plan a joint \"friend of the court\" brief on its behalf. Facebook said it will join with Google, Twitter and Microsoft on a joint court filing. A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file \"multiple\" briefs.\n\nApple filed court papers on Thursday that asked U.S. Magistrate Sheri Pym to reverse her order on the grounds that the government had no legal authority to force the company to weaken the security of its own products. The company accused the government of seeking \"dangerous power\" through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nThe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing 51 percent of Americans think Apple should cooperate by helping the government unlock the iPhone.\n\nThe FBI and other law-enforcement agencies insist they need to get into the phone in order to run down every lead in the San Bernardino shootings, which were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State extremist group. But skeptics have questioned whether this particular device -- a work phone issued by one shooter's employer -- is likely to contain much useful information. Both assailants took care to destroy their personal phones prior to the massacre.\n\nSome police officials acknowledge similar doubts. \"If they went out of their way to destroy the other phones, there's a pretty good chance there may not be anything of value,\" said Jarrod Burguan, San Bernardino's police chief. \"This may be a whole lot of saber rattling and back and forth for nothing.\" Burguan, however, believes police still have \"a duty and a responsibility\" to make sure there's no useful evidence on the phone.\n\nIt's unclear how the controversy might affect Apple's business. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most Americans think about Apple or its products.\n\nAt least one shareholder at Friday's meeting voiced support for the company's stance.\n\n\"Apple is 100 percent correct in not providing or doing research to create software to break into it,\" said Tom Rapko, an Apple investor from Santa Barbara, California, as he waited in line to enter the auditorium at Apple's headquarters. \"I think if you give the government an inch, they'll take a yard.\"\n\nCook offered only brief remarks about the FBI case, and most questions from shareholders concerned other aspects of Apple's business. But the CEO won praise during the meeting from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Internet rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n\"We applaud your leadership,\" said Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to Martin Luther King, Jr. \"I recall the FBI wiretapping Dr. King in the civil rights movement,\" Jackson added. \"We cannot go down this path again. Some of us do remember the days of (former FBI director J. Edgar) Hoover and McCarthy and Nixon and enemies lists.\"\n\nApple's share price has seen little change since the issue erupted in the news last week. Overall, though, the company's stock has declined in recent months over worries that iPhone sales were slowing around the world.\n\nA hearing on the iPhone legal dispute is scheduled for next month.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Tami Abdollah in Washington, Amanda Lee Myers in Los Angeles and Bree Fowler in New York contributed to this report.", "Since the iPad Pro launched, the old debate about whether the iPad can replace the Mac as a work machine has been reignited. Jason Snell explains why he's firmly in the middle.\n\nWe live in polarizing times: If you're not on one team, you must be on the other. Compromise is sniffed at, if not denounced outright. And yet I find myself in the middle between these two extremes. Yes, that's right: I love my Mac and my iPad and use them both.\n\nIn the months since the release of the iPad Pro, the old debate about whether the iPad is a suitable replacement for the Mac to get serious work done has been re-ignited. On one side are people such as Federico Viticci of MacStories, who has almost entirely replaced his Mac with an iPad Pro. On the other are a host of skeptics who say that the iPad isn't a device suitable for real work -- to get the job done, you need a Mac.\n\nThis is getting silly.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being someone who is a dyed-in-the-wool Mac user -- I've been one for years. If the Mac is what you know and is the best tool for doing the job, it should be what you use. There's also nothing wrong with being a committed iPad user, who has left the desktop metaphor behind and has embraced using lightweight, ultra-portable devices to do their work.\n\nIn the arguments about the future of computing, people like to pick sides, but the fact is that traditional computers and touchscreen mobile devices will both be with us for years to come. I'm starting to think my daughter, born in 2001, is going to be a laptop user for life. My son, born in 2004, is more of a toss-up.\n\nNot too long ago, I was asked on a podcast if I was Team Mac or Team iPad. It was a trick question, because the person asking it and I are both on Team Both. Team Both is the place to be. Shifting between iPad and Mac -- and let's not forget the iPhone, since most of us carry around a smartphone all the time, too -- can be a remarkably flexible and fulfilling way to work.\n\nSince I bought an iPad Pro last fall, I have almost entirely stopped using my old 11-inch MacBook Air. I still do most of my work at a desk in front of a 5K iMac, and I love everything about it, from its powerful quad-core processor to its amazing high-resolution screen. But sometimes I need a change of scenery, a switch in context. I find myself staring at my iMac screen, often with a blank text-editor document and a blinking cursor. I need to change things up.\n\nWhen I switch to my iPad Pro, it feels like I'm taking a break from work, but I'm actually still working -- just in an entirely different context. Sometimes, I'll read and reply to email in a chair. Other times, when that blinking cursor daunts me, I'll put the iPad Pro on the bar in my kitchen and turn on a Bluetooth keyboard and start writing while standing at the bar.\n\nOccasionally I will use AirDrop to transfer a file from one device to another, but more often I simply use cloud file-sharing services to do the trick. While I have access to iCloud Drive, Google Drive, and Microsoft's OneDrive, my cloud-storage service of choice is Dropbox.\n\nWhen I'm on the Mac, I save what I'm writing -- usually just Markdown-formatted text files in BBEdit -- to Dropbox. On the iPad Pro, I am doing most of my writing in the 1Writer text editor, which lets me open documents directly from Dropbox.\n\nSwitching to my iPad is also made easier by the fact that most of the tools I use everyday sync their data sources across devices. I rely on Safari bookmarks and history, which iCloud keeps in sync, and I can use iCloud Tabs to pull up any webpages I had open on my Mac when I switch to my iPad. And logging in to web services is easy because I'm using 1Password, which stores all my passwords and also syncs via Dropbox.\n\nJust because I can work on both devices doesn't mean that I do the same work on both. For me, the Mac is much better suited for some tasks than the iPad, and vice versa.\n\nMy iMac has much more power even than the iPad Pro, and a broader variety of software. I'm not going to encode video on the iPad Pro, or edit a multi-hour video for posting to YouTube. There are a lot of great text editors on iOS, but no single one of them can fulfill me in the way that BBEdit does, with its support for regular expression search, syntax highlighting, scripting, and (via the Mac filesystem) seamless support for every cloud-storage service.\n\nI'm also much more comfortable with scripting and automation on the Mac than on the iPad, though iOS has upped its game on that front in recent years with tools like Workflow and text editors with macro support based on Python or JavaScript. The fact that you can pop into the Terminal app in the Mac and execute powerful commands, then build them into complex shell scripts and connect those directly with an app or keyboard shortcut via an Automator action.... that's just stuff iOS can't match, yet.\n\nUtilities are another area where the Mac excels. I rely on LaunchBar to open apps and documents, do math, open webpages, perform searches, and a lot of other tasks that Spotlight on iOS (or the Mac, for that matter) just can't do. LaunchBar also serves as a clipboard manager, giving me access not just to a single set of clipboard contents, but an entire clipboard history. iOS has clipboard managers, but you have to remember to save items to them as you're working -- on the Mac, it just happens in the background. And a utility like Keyboard Maestro, which can remap keyboard shortcuts to shortcuts simple or complex, just isn't possible on iOS yet.\n\nOn the iPad, on the other hand, I get a simpler interface that allows me to focus. On my Mac, I habitually have many apps open and visible on the gigantic screen. On the iPad, I keep it simple -- a single app, or perhaps a second app in Split View if I'm pulling data from one place and pushing it into another. The occasional Notification Center banner will appear, but in general I find the iPad to be far less distracting.\n\nSome of the apps are just better. The sad truth is, Mac app development is sleepy at best and moribund at worst. That's not the worst thing in the world, because the Mac platform is pretty mature and the apps that are there are often excellent. But iOS apps seem to be much more constantly developed, and there's strong competition driving developers to do more, and to do it better. On my Mac there are only two or three apps I would consider writing in, while on the iPad I have flitted from app to app over the years as new features have trumped the competition.\n\nThen there's the trouble with Google Apps. There was a time when Google was doing a great job being a good iPad developer with its Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps. But today, those apps are in a state of disrepair. They're often buggy and they don't support the iPad Pro screen size at all. It's driven a lot of my work out of Google Apps and into Microsoft Office, plain text, and Quip. A lack of good Google Apps apps makes my iPad pro experience worse, and makes me retreat back to my Mac.\n\nBut in a lot of surprising places, I consider the iPad and Mac at parity. I can post a story to my website from either device with just about the same amount of work, and I've built automation on both to resize and upload images to the right places and pop the appropriate HTML code for those images onto the clipboard.\n\nMore surprising to me is the discovery that I can edit podcasts just about as easily on the iPad with Ferrite Recording Studio as with Logic Pro X on my Mac. The experiences are different, to be sure -- there are more plug-ins and audio processing apps on the Mac, for instance. But editing audio with just my hands is fulfilling in a way that clicking around in Logic isn't. And when you consider that fully loaded with in-app purchases, Ferrite costs $20 to Logic Pro's $200, it's a much better option for people with an iPad and a limited budget.\n\nA couple of years ago when I talked to a bunch of Apple executives about the future of the Mac, I was impressed with their attitude: Apple makes many tools that can be used in many ways, so use the tools that you're comfortable with. While I appreciate the devotion of Mac users and the excitement of iPad trailblazers express, I find myself happy to be walking a middle path.\n\nI use my Mac during my workday, take breaks to work on the iPad Pro, and then use the iPad Pro for work and leisure when I close the door to my office at the end of the day. I use them both and like them both. My life is better with both of these devices in it. I wouldn't have it any other way.", "Christian Morris, a student at Springbank Middle School, was hard at work coding his video game, a horror game in which the player has to navigate through a world while the lights flick on and off.\n\nWhen one thinks of foundational skills necessary for students to learn, reading, writing and arithmetic instantly come to mind. But with advances in technology, a new type of language is becoming increasingly important.\n\nComputer language - formal instructions communicated via code to control computers and other machines - is a relatively new addition to school curriculum. But even Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking at Google Canada on Jan. 14, said, \"we need to do a lot better job getting young people to understand what coding is and how it's important.\"\n\nThat philosophy is shared by Bill Belsey, a teacher at Springbank Middle School. He said the value of understanding code will continue to increase for students as time goes on.\n\n\"It's just endless, the number of things that we're (using) coding for,\" he said. \"Hardware only runs if there are a proper set of commands to tell the tools what to do in the most efficient and safest way.\"\n\nAt Springbank, Belsey teaches an option coding class where students have the opportunity to learn a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python and Scratch.\n\nAlexander Berezowski, a Grade 7 student, said he has been coding since he was in Grade 3. In Belsey's class, Berezowski codes in Batch - which sees him listing a series of commands in a text file, which the computer then interprets.\n\n\"Batch is when you run a command prompt on the PC. Batch is the easiest language,\" he said. \"It's very English-based. You copy and paste, and all that. I just really like coding. I create whatever I want. I just have to use Notepad.\"\n\nBerezowski's focus is developing antivirus software. After finding a virus on his home computer, Berezowski started developing software to try and eliminate the portions of the code in the virus causing the problems.\n\n\"In the text, there's a bunch of symbols that the user can't see. But there's some symbols that they can,\" he said. \"By looking at the placement of those, I'm able to create an algorithm for every virus to create an anti-virus to that.\"\n\nUltimately, Berezowski hopes to work at Norton, an antivirus and security company.\n\nAnother student, Sarah Matrai, is a minority amongst the classroom - she's one of only three girls in Belsey's class, a fact that doesn't bother her.\n\n\"I don't really find it that big of a difference,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like I can ask anybody here a question or anything. I just feel at home.\"\n\nMatrai is working on a video game starring two avatars - a male and a female. In the game, the player controls the male avatar, who is chased relentlessly around the screen by the female avatar.\n\n\"I would say it's the story of someone who is overly obsessed to the point where it's creepy and weird,\" Matrai said. \"Personal life experiences.\"\n\nMatrai, who is coding for the first time, said she finds the process relaxing and fun. Classmate Christian Morris, who is working on a horror video game, said he would like to attempt to find a job in the video game industry.\n\n\"Honestly, I always have enjoyed coding,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about taking a blank slate and then bending the computer to your will to do what you want.\"\n\nBelsey said he hoped his students would go on to be well equipped in a modern work environment.\n\n\"The point is to learn all these other skills. It's fantastic. I think every kid in Alberta should have some exposure in coding,\" he said.\n\n\"It just shows that you can create an environment where kids have success, even if they've never coded before. That makes me proud of them all.\"", "Apple shareholders enter building 4 for the annual shareholders meeting Friday, Feb. 26, 2016, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Ben Margot / AP)\n\nI was prepared for anything. I've been at Apple shareholder meetings -- O K, I'm dating myself here -- when investors stormed the citadel and called for the CEO's head.\n\nApple investors at the annual meeting on Friday might have demanded the company break open the iPhone for the FBI, the controversy that has embroiled the company for the past two weeks, and move past this distraction to other projects that could improve the bottom line: conquering new markets (India) and launching new products (the rumored Apple car), to name two.\n\nInstead, the 200 or so shareholders cheered Tim Cook, who in turn thanked them for their support over the past two weeks. It must have been a good feeling for Cook after all the heat he has gotten from law enforcement, politicians and average citizens who wonder why the company is taking a stand over an issue involving a terrorist case.\n\nIf he is feeling the pressure of \"being in the news lately,\" as he put it in an understated way, Cook didn't show it.\n\n\"We are a staunch advocate for our customers' privacy and personal safety,\" said Cook, casually perched on a stool with his iPad at the ready. \"We do these (things) because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn't scare us.\"\n\nCook's appearance in front of shareholders capped quite a week for the company.\n\nApple is caught in a war of words with the FBI and the U.S. government over the encryption of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino assailants responsible for the death of 14 people and the serious injury of 22 in December.\n\nThe dispute was the topic of a congressional hearing this week and even became part of the GOP presidential debate Thursday night. The company has received the support of key tech companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google.\n\nAlso Thursday, Apple responded to a court order that it comply with the FBI's request to help law enforcement gain access to the phone's contents. Apple said that forcing the company to write software to hack the phone was a form of \"compelled speech,\" among other arguments, claiming that Apple was entitled to First Amendment protections.\n\nCook made a 30-minute appearance this week on ABC News defending the company's stance, sounding populist themes about protecting our digital privacy.\n\nThere, in trying to make a point about how serious the situation is, Cook compared cracking the iPhone's protections to writing the \"software equivalent of cancer.\"\n\nI thought that metaphor, which he repeated several times, was a rare misstep on Cook's part. Hyperbole, as we know from watching the GOP presidential candidates debate, can be very useful.\n\nBut Apple has to be extremely careful how it portrays this dilemma -- and overstating the situation can backfire both in court and in the court of public opinion. So far, people are roughly divided evenly in support of Apple and the FBI, polls show.\n\nAnd meanwhile, there are plenty of other pressure point for Apple, which, after all, is a global company with a lot at stake.\n\nAt the annual meeting, shareholders held forth about other topics such as how retail stores could better serve the business community and Apple's future in China and India. Apple has big hopes for India, was Cook's message.\n\nWhen will the new campus be finished, one person asked: January 2017.\n\n\"Steve spent the last couple years of his life really dedicating himself to that project. It will be the center of innovation for years to come,\" Cook said, referring to Apple co-founder and former chief executive, Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd is Apple making an iCar?\n\nCook: \"Remember when you were a kid and Christmas Eve was so exciting and you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? It's going to be Christmas Eve for awhile.\"\n\nShareholders voted down a proposal asking the company to accelerate the recruitment process of senior leadership in order to make those ranks more diverse.\n\nBut even the Rev. Jesse Jackson of the RainbowPush Coalition didn't dwell on diversity and tech, one of his top issues.\n\nInstead, he applauded the company for its stance in its running battle with the FBI, saying there has to be a way that supports \"personal freedom and privacy and supports the needs of law enforcement and national security.\" He evoked an era in U.S. history when law enforcement created an enemies list of civil rights leaders who were monitored.\n\n\"Those who have no regard for human rights, if they have the power to order a company to open up files, there are no limits,\" Jackson told me.\n\nCook did his job well on Friday, projecting a quiet calm and unwavering commitment to the issue. I hope he had a chance to savor the moment.\n\nOther venues Cook may go to in the coming months won't be as friendly.", "Morgan Freeman is now available to narrate the life of any commuter who needs him through the use of Google's navigation app, named Waze.\n\nFreeman will address the driver as the President Of The United States and will give you turn by turn directions in the gravelly voice of gravitas only he can deliver.\n\nThe feature is only available for a limited time.\n\nMorgan Freeman stars in the upcoming feature film,\"London Has Fallen\", the sequel to action thriller \"Olympus Has Fallen\".", "At Friday's annual meeting of Apple shareholders, CEO Tim Cook was clearly ready to field questions about the company's ongoing battle with the FBI over encryption. But nobody there seemed very interested in discussing it.\n\nThe FBI wants the Cupertino, California, tech company to help it unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. But Apple refuses, arguing that doing so would set a dangerous precedent and make all its users less safe.\n\nApple has challenged a court order to unlock the iPhone in question, citing freedom of speech.\n\nCook brought up the ongoing battle, unbidden, during his prepared remarks to the assembled Apple shareholders: \"Some of you may have questions on that,\" he said, to applause.\n\nBut overall, shareholders didn't seem that curious about the Apple-FBI fight, even if it's all that the tech world is talking about. Given that Apple's stock price hasn't moved much, even amid these battles, it seems like they don't consider it much of a risk.\n\n\"We do this because this is the right thing to do. Being hard doesn't scare us,\" Cook elaborated in his remarks. \"I'm incredibly proud to be working for this company at this time with the most unbelievable people in the world.\"\n\nThat was apparently enough for the gathering of Apple shareholders. Because when Cook ended his remarks, and the opportunity for Q&A from shareholders began -- possibly the public's one and only chance to ask the CEO of the second-most-valuable company in the world a question -- none of them even brought it up.\n\nThe only further mention of the Apple/FBI issue during the meeting was a prepared statement, not even a question, from Cindy Cohn, executive director of the prominent digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. In her statement, Cohn announced that the EFF will be filing an amicus brief in support of Apple next week, joining tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook.\n\nGetty Images/Scott OlsonThe Reverend Jesse Jackson\n\nOtherwise, shareholders had other concerns on their mind: Reverend Jesse Jackson made another appearance to urge Apple towards further diversity within the company; another asked if Apple planned to keep supporting older iPhone models with new iOS operating system software (they are).\n\nOne guy asked how Apple planned to pivot towards being a services business when he couldn't get his Beats Music and Apple Music accounts to sync up (Cook promised someone would take care of his technical issues). Someone else wanted to know how Apple views India, to which Cook responded \"we see India as basically where China was 10 years ago,\" which is to say, a big opportunity.\n\nAnother person asked about the Apple Car, to Cook's chagrin.\n\nStill, it gave Cook a chance to show off his sometimes-understated sense of humor. One questioner asked if future shareholder meetings would allow them to send Cook their questions ahead of time. A little later, Cook urged shareholders to drop him an e-mail if their question wasn't addressed during the meeting.\n\n\"It's tcook@apple.com,\" Cook said, addressing the earlier questioner. \"I'm surprised you didn't know it, it seems like everyone else in the world knows it.\"", "Users now have an easy way to put messages off until the weekend\n\nGoogle is giving Inbox users a couple more ways to avoid dealing with their email right away.\n\nThe company announced Friday that users of its alternative email client are getting two new snooze options that will move emails out of their inbox until an appointed time. People will be able to make emails reappear later in the week or at the weekend, two options the company said users had been asking for.\n\nThose features join others, including the ability to get a message back later in the day, the following week, or at an unspecified time in the future. (That last option may seem strange, but it could be useful for things that are good to know but don't need to be acted on right away, like an email from a friend sharing an article with you.)\n\nUsers can also set up Inbox with their preferred date and time on the weekend to receive those messages, which is useful for people who have different weekend schedules, or just a particular time when it makes sense for them to tackle issues that aren't pressing during the work week.\n\nThe snooze feature was popularized by Mailbox, an app Dropbox acquired in 2013 and recently shut down. That functionality has made its way to other email apps in the interim, including Inbox and Microsoft Outlook. Being able to snooze emails is helpful for people who tend to use their inbox as a to-do list, something that Google's revamped email client encourages.\n\nThe new snoozes will be rolling out over the coming week, along with a new look for snoozing overall that Google is also introducing with this update.", "Human bodies are becoming the ultimate renewable resource as the medical field continues to march forward into the 21st century. On Thursday, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic successfully completed the first ever uterus transplant in the United States, giving new hope to women who may have related childbirth issues. The surgery took place over the course of nine hours, and the 26-year-old patient (whose identity has been withheld to protect her privacy) is said to be in stable condition.\n\nThe screening process for the highly anticipated procedure began late last year, the Cleveland Clinic says, with a group of transplant specialists, obstetricians and gynecologists, bioethicists, psychiatrists, nurses, and social workers examining the applications of numerous candidates who suffer from Uterine Factor Infertility (UFI), described as \"an irreversible condition affecting 3 percent to 5 percent of women worldwide.\"\n\nThe transplant theoretically allows women who do not have a \"competent\" uterus, or one capable of carrying a fetus to term, to become pregnant and give birth, though it would have to be via in vitro fertilization. Prior to the procedure, the patient's eggs were surgically removed, fertilized with her husband's sperm, and subsequently frozen. In a year's time, she will be able to have the embryos transferred back to her new uterus with the hopes of bearing a child.\n\nRelated:\n\n\"Women who are coping with UFI have few existing options,\" Tommaso Falcone, chairman of the Department of Obstetrics-Gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said last year, when the clinical trial was initially announced. \"Although adoption and surrogacy provide opportunities for parenthood, both pose logistical challenges and may not be acceptable due to personal, cultural, or legal reasons.\"\n\nRelated: Google and Johnson & Johnson are working on robots for surgery\n\nInterestingly enough, this transplant is not meant to be a permanent one -- in fact, once the patient has had children, the uterus will be removed, as otherwise, she would be forced to take anti-rejection drugs for the remainder of her life.\n\n\"Unlike any other transplants, they are 'ephemeral,'\" noted Cleveland Clinic lead investigator Dr. Andreas Tzakis last year. \"They are not intended to last for the duration of the recipient's life, but will be maintained for only as long as is necessary to produce one or two children.\"\n\nStill, the mere availability of the procedure (and its successful first implementation) opens unprecedented doors for women across the country. Swedish surgeons have previously been able to complete the transplant, and that patient went on to have a baby.\n\nThe Ethics Board at the Cleveland Clinic has given clearance for a total of 10 such procedures thus far.\n\nAlso watch: FBI probing 'Anonymous' hack on Cleveland's website", "\"I know which election I'm focusing on.

Arguments that we would lose from sea-level rise or more extreme events are unproven conjectures.\"\n\nLinks to the policy are still catalogued by Google and a cached version is available.

Today, in its second upward revision, the number of affected people now stands at over 700,000.\n\nThe Hack\n\nAs WIRED originally reported last spring, the hack gave attackers access to entire tax returns, which means people's social security numbers, address, and incomes were all compromised. The hackers used personal information already in hand to get unauthorized access through an IRS application called \"Get Transcript.\"\n\nIn other words, much of the information had already been acquired, including SSNs and dates of birth. \"Get Transcript\" has been offline since the first indications of a breach last May.\n\nWho's Affected\n\nThe initial IRS report indicated that 114,000 accounts had been compromised. It revised that number last August, raising it to 334,000. On Friday, the IRS added another 390,000 accounts to the pile, for a total of well over 700,000 people. There have also been a total of 500,000 targeted, but failed, attempts at access.\n\nThe IRS will begin mailing affected taxpayers from this most recent batch starting February 29th. If you're one of them, you also qualify for free Equifax identity theft protection for one year, and \"extra scrutiny\" on tax returns associated with your SSN.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nIn terms of the type of information that's been compromised, it's no worse than it was last May. That's still plenty bad, though; if there's information about yourself you might consider sensitive, it's probably on your tax return somewhere.\n\nWhat's more serious at this point is the extent to which the IRS underestimated the severity of the breach. It's been nearly a year. That's a long time for 390,000 people to have been vulnerable but not know it.\n\nThe revelations come at the end of a nine-month investigation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which hopefully means that it's the last of upward revisions. The IRS also notes that not all of these cases necessarily involve malevolent actors.\n\n\"TIGTA investigators identified suspicious email addresses that made multiple attempts to access accounts,\" the agency said in a statement today. \"It is possible that some of those identified may be family members, tax return preparers, or financial institutions using a single email address to attempt to access more than one account.\"\n\nFor now, just keep an eye on your mailbox next week. And if you have a notice from the IRS, brace yourself for the very real possibility of identity theft.\n\nGo Back to Top.

Now, Motherboard reports, a hacker has threatened another federal employee dump of a much smaller scale but potentially more sensitive target: the names, titles, and contact information of nearly 30,000 FBI and Department of Homeland Security workers.\n\nThe Hack\n\nMotherboard first reported the hack on Sunday, after obtaining the data. Since then, the information of roughly several thousand DHS employees appears to have been released by anonymous sources. The 20,000 FBI employees appear not to have been exposed yet.\n\nUpdate: The FBI information has now been leaked as well. Both dumps are accompanied by pro-Palestine slogans.\n\nThe hacker told Motherboard that he was able to access the files through the compromised email account of a Department of Justice employee. He claimed to have downloaded 200GB of files, out of 1TB total available to him. That would imply that the information that's been leaked so far is just a small percentage of the total.\n\nWho's Affected\n\nAs of right now, the names, titles, email addresses, and phone numbers of 9,000 DHS employees have been made public, with 20,000 FBI employees at risk of exposure as well. The hacker told Motherboard that he also had some military emails and credit card numbers, but provided neither proof nor indication that he intended to release them.\n\nThe FBI employees nearly 35,000 people, meaning that more than half of the agency's people would be at risk. It's not clear if any of the 20,000 who are involved in the hack are in sensitive positions.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nThe hack doesn't impact you directly unless you work for one of the agencies involved, and even then it seems most likely to result mostly in annoyance.\n\nWhat's more serious is that these details were accessible in the first place, through seemingly not terribly sophisticated means. These are agencies that deal in highly sensitive information; if they can't secure their digital doors, there's no reason to think any branch of government can.\n\nThen again, if even the director of the CIA can't lock down his (AOL) email account, perhaps it's wishful thinking that any other agency's employees might fair better.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.\n\nApple has now removed over 300 pieces of software from the App Store, after malware that targeted developers managed to create infected iOS apps. On top of that, it looks like the apps are more dangerous to Apple customers than previously thought.\n\nSeveral security companies have now banded together in the search for malicious iOS apps: Claud Xiao from PaloAlto Networks has reportedly discovered 39, Fox-IT also found a number of others, a representative told WIRED in an email. Many of those apps are popular in China, such as Railway 12306, used for purchasing train tickets, and a version of WeChat, a messaging app. Only the older version 6.2.5 is infected, whereas the app's up-to-date version is clean.\n\nHowever, it appears that some affected apps are also used by Apple customers in the United States. 'CamCard', an app for scanning and storing business cards, and which was a 'Top Paid App' in 2014, is also infected, according to Palo Alto Networks.\n\nOriginally, the malware was seen to be fairly innocuous: it could siphon off only small snippets of information such as a device's ID, and the current time.\n\nBut according to findings from one researcher, and then built upon by Xiao, the infected apps are also capable of receiving commands from the attacker. These commands can apparently allow a hacker to read and write data to the victim's clipboard, open specific URLs, or prompt a fake alert on the victim's screen. Some of these could be used to steal passwords, Xiao claims.\n\nApple did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but company spokesperson Christine Monaghan told The Guardian in an email that \"We've removed the apps from the app store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,\" and that \"We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps.\"\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.\n\nThe Apple ecosystem is well known for very rarely letting any dodgy apps enter it because of the company's stringent security checks.\n\nBut recently, nearly two dozen malicious pieces of software managed to get hosted on the App Store, and subsequently downloaded by Chinese users. This is because attackers found an unorthodox route to exploit: they targeted some versions of the software used by developers to makes apps for iOS and OS X in the first place.\n\nThe Hack\n\nThe malware was first highlighted by Chinese developers on Weibo, and was then analyzed by researchers from Alibaba. Security company Palo Alto Networks then verified the results.\n\nThe hack all hinges around Xcode, a tool used to create iOS and OS X apps. Typically, Xcode is downloaded directly from Apple for free. However, it is possible to get Xcode from other sources too, such as developer forums. Some versions of Xcode found on Baidu Yunpan, a Chinese file-sharing service, come packaged with extra lines of code. The Alibaba researchers have dubbed these malicious variants \"XcodeGhost.\"\n\nApps constructed with XcodeGhost code will collect a bunch of information about a customer's device once the app has been downloaded. The data siphoned includes the current time, the name of the device, and the network type -- none of which is anything a hacker could really use against you.\n\nOne of the apps that passed Apple's security checks was NetEase Cloud Music, which, according to a screenshot provided by Palo Alto Networks, has nearly 500 ratings, averaging out at four and a half stars. Claud Xiao, a senior malware researcher from Palo Alto Networks, tells WIRED in an email the company had verified over 20 apps that were infected.\n\n\"Some of them are very popular and have tens of millions of installations,\" Xiao writes.\n\nWho's Affected?\n\nThe iOS users who downloaded these apps, first of all. However, the apps analyzed were reportedly only from the Chinese App Store, so it doesn't look like customers from other areas of the world need to worry.\n\nAlso, any developers who obtained their copy of Xcode from an unofficial source could be affected, as there is a chance their products are not totally above board. XcodeGhost could also affect developers creating enterprise apps. These are apps made by companies specifically for their own employees' devices, so they don't have to go through any sort of Apple security check. However, \"that's a pretty obscure attack,\" Charlie Miller, a security researcher at Uber who got his own malicious software onto the App Store in 2011, tells WIRED in a phone interview.\n\nHow Severe Is This?\n\nThe malware in the App Store itself is not concerning, but there's a broader issue here: the way in which it got past Apple's screening process in the first place.\n\n\"You might completely trust the app developer, and that developer might be completely trustworthy, but this is a case where the app wasn't,\" Miller said. That, and the fact that software made from a tampered version of Xcode found its way onto the App Store, should give developers pause.\n\nApple did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nBut what about consumers, and the people who downloaded the malicious apps? They should be only slightly concerned. \"I wouldn't worry too much,\" Miller says. The apps that did get through didn't seem to do any really nasty stuff. \"If you made it really, obviously bad, probably [Apple] would catch it,\" Miller says.\n\nThe bottom line for customers is, if you've downloaded one of these dodgy apps, delete it, and keep up with reports of other ones slipping through. What should developers do to protect their own apps and their customers?\n\n\"The moral of the story is: don't download random crap from Chinese sites,\" Miller says.\n\nGo Back to Top.

The piece is powerful and moving, a brave act on behalf of the women willing to tell their stories directly and an important piece of interactive journalism highlighting a culture of silence around rape. Unfortunately, unless you read it last night, you can't currently access the report on NYMag.com because the site is down, presumably as a result of a DDoS attack, according to a report by The Daily Dot. A Twitter user by the name of Vikingdom2016 has taken credit for the assault.\n\nThough Vikingdom2016 reportedly told The Daily Dot that the attack had nothing to do with the Cosby story and was done because he \"hates New York,\" it reeks of victim silencing. For 35 women to come out and accuse one of the entertainment industry's most powerful men of repeated sexual abuse is an act of defiance against a history of systemic silencing. Whether the alleged DDoS attacker knew it, by taking the story offline he is following in a grand tradition of keeping women's stories from being heard -- a tradition the story itself is trying to break.\n\nOn a brighter note, you can still read a cached version of the story while the site is down.\n\nThanks to the Wayback Machine you can still read the @NYMag cover story while the site's down. http://t.co/iZLaLCRfeQ (ht @elongreen)\n\n-- Sarah Weinman (@sarahw) July 27, 2015\n\nGo Back to Top.

Depending on the chat client you use, you may not even see the text message before it infects you -- for instance, if you use Hangouts, the app will decipher the code before you ever get a notification of the text.\n\nThe Who:\n\nDrake estimates that 950 million people use Android devices that could be at risk.\n\nHow Serious:\n\nThe researchers who found the flaws told NPR that they do not believe it is yet in use in the wild. Still, it is potentially the largest flaw ever uncovered in Android. The good news is that Google has a fix. The bad news is that Google can't send it to most directly -- it needs manufacturers and carriers to push the patch out to you. As of writing, it is unclear which devices are still at risk.\n\n\"All devices should be assumed to be vulnerable,\" Drake told Forbes.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. The Hack\n\nCVS pharmacies in the US and Walmart Canada have halted their online photo-processing following information that the third-party company that operates this service may have been breached, possibly compromising the credit card numbers of millions of customers.\n\nWho Is Affected?\n\nPNI Digital Media of Vancouver hosts the photo-processing web sites for CVS, Walmart, and Costco. It is owned by Staples, which was the target of its own major hack last year.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Walmart's photo-processing site for US customers is not believed to have been affected. As for CVS, other services beyond its photo-processing service, such as its e-commerce business and contact lens ordering service, are also not affected since they are managed separately from the photo-processing system.\n\nHow Serious Is This?\n\nIt's impossible to know with so little information at this point. If you've used the online photo services of either of these Canadian sites, check your bank statements.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.", "Geotags? GPS? Pssh. That's old school. Google has a brand-new trick for figuring out where the photos you've taken happen to be, and it doesn't need any extra data from your camera to do it -- just the photo itself, assuming it's not a blurry or otherwise bad shot.\n\nGoogle's program, called PlaNet, isn't perfect, but it's not easy to figure out where an image might have been shot just by its contents. We doubt you could do that, and that's something Google has actually tested via the website GeoGuesser, which tasks you with figuring out exactly what PlaNet has to figure out: where are you?\n\n\"In total, PlaNet won 28 of the 50 rounds with a median localization error of 1131.7 km, while the median human localization error was 2320.75 km. [This] small-scale experiment shows that PlaNet reaches superhuman performance at the task of geolocating Street View scenes,\" Tobias Weyand, a Google specialist whose team built PlaNet, told MIT Technology Review.\n\nAs for how Weyand and his team managed to construct PlaNet -- which, amazingly, only uses 377MB of memory to run -- it gets complicated. The team divided the world into a grid of 26,000 or so boxes. It then dumped 91 million geotagged images into a database, and instructed PlaNet to figure out which boxes each image appeared in. This became the \"brain\" that the machine would then use to figure out what coordinates a new image was most likely to have, based on the visual attributes the new photo shares with other images in PlaNet's giant database.\n\nAfter that, the team used 34 million more images to validate their system, and then put PlaNet to the test by seeing just how well its system deciphered the correct location for 2.3 million geotagged Flickr photos. The results? PlaNet could pinpoint 3.6 percent of these images to street-level accuracy, figure out the city for another 10.1 percent, get the country for 28.4 percent, and the continent for 48 percent of them.\n\n\"We think PlaNet has an advantage over humans because it has seen many more places than any human can ever visit and has learned subtle cues of different scenes that are even hard for a well-traveled human to distinguish,\" Weyand said.\n\nWe don't yet know how Google, or the PlaNet team, plans to use its findings going forward. Perhaps, though, Google could at least give you a hand deciphering where some of your older, non-geotagged photos came from. That, or it could launch the hardest Carmen Sandiego game you've ever seen.", "If Apple gives in to the FBI and creates backdoor access to a device's contents, the backdoor is likely to get into the hands of the people committing crimes and spreading terror.\n\nApple is dominating the news, without a new product in sight.\n\nIn this case, as you have probably read or seen, Apple is tussling with the FBI over an iPhone used by one of the murderers in last year's San Bernardino shootings.\n\nBriefly, the situation is this: The FBI wants to access the information on an iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a phone supplied by his employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health.\n\nThe phone is protected by a pass code, as well as the setting that erases the device's contents after 10 attempts. To get in, the FBI wants Apple to create a modified version of iOS that will update the existing operating system and remove the automatic erasure. Then, investigators could \"brute-force\" the device by trying millions of number combinations.\n\nApple is refusing, for good reason. The FBI claims that this is a one-time-only request, but the agency is either unbelievably naive (doubtful) or being disingenuous about its motives. Here's why: Creating that compromised version of iOS can't possibly be limited to this one instance, and the consequences of making it are dire.\n\nI'm not being hyperbolic. If such a version were to exist, it would mean that the iPhone's built-in encryption can be defeated. It would also set a precedent that would open the door to courts demanding Apple do the same in other cases. (The FBI has since acknowledged that's a possibility.)\n\nBut wait, that sounds good, right? We want to defeat terrorists and catch criminals and keep people safe. Unfortunately, this solution makes people less safe, because once this type of backdoor exists, it's likely to get into the hands of the people committing crimes and spreading terror.\n\nAccording to forensic scientist Jonathan Zdziarski, making any evidence gleaned from this type of search stand up in court automatically requires multiple copies of the exploit to be shared -- for validation, for review by prosecutors and defendants, and more. Now imagine the value of being able to break into anyone's iOS device worldwide. Criminals (and governments) would certainly tempt someone in that chain of dissemination to make a copy.\n\nAnd when it's in the wild, no iOS device would be safe: yours, lawmakers (the President gets intelligence briefings on an iPad), CEOs (opening up all sorts of potential industrial secrets) and anyone with private information.\n\nAnd it's not just iOS. Setting this precedent would mean the FBI or other agencies could compel Google and other manufacturers to expose hundreds of millions of devices. And if the United States can do it, you had better believe China, Russia and other nations will, too.\n\nMy colleague Rich Mogull, in one of the most cogent takes on this situation, wrote, \"(A)sk yourself, do we have a right to security? To secure devices, communications and services? Devices secure from criminals, foreign governments and yes, even our own? And by extension, do we have a right to privacy? Because privacy without security is impossible.\"\n\nRight now, Apple and the FBI are moving into the legal phase of this argument. It's nearly guaranteed that an upcoming version of iOS will make even this workaround that the government is asking for in this case impossible to perform in the future.\n\nSo, from a practical standpoint, what can you do to maintain the security of your own personal information?\n\nFirst, if you're not using a pass code on your iOS device, set one up now. The pass code activates encryption of data on the phone. If your pass code is four numbers (the previous default), change it to a six-digit or alphanumeric pass code: Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (or just Passcode on devices without Touch ID) > Change Passcode. After you enter your existing code, tap the Passcode Options link and change the type.\n\nNext, save sensitive information in a secure app such as 1Password. The days of keeping passwords in Notes or your Address Book are over. (That said, the next version of iOS will allow individual notes in the Notes app to be secured by pass code.)\n\nIf you're especially concerned, turn off iCloud backups and back up your device's data to a computer using iTunes; there you'll have an option to encrypt local backups. Currently, contents of iCloud backups are not encrypted, and Apple will share that information when subpoenaed to do so.\n\nNone of these actions makes you a terrorist sympathizer, because, honestly, terrorism is low on the list of threats to everyday people. Someone stealing your iPhone, breaking into it, and accessing your bank accounts and online accounts is more likely, and even that is a remote possibility compared with having your bank card numbers stolen from a big retailer that doesn't properly secure its own data.\n\nI'm hopeful that a sensible resolution comes out of this, and it's good that people who don't follow technology are being exposed to this issue.\n\nWhether on phones, wearables or \"smart home\" devices, encryption and security are absolutely vital, and those technologies are coming fast. Undermining security in one instance undermines it for everyone.", "One of my favorite travel maxims - as I'm bolting out the door to catch a flight - comes from the brilliant ladies of Absolutely Fabulous: \"Tickets! Money! Passport!\" I used to say the same, but for the last few years I've added a fourth, equally vital item: Smartphone.\n\nMost folks who frequently travel abroad know their Android or iOS device can be their most valuable companion - and not just for communication. For the rest of us, though, here's a short and useful primer for maximizing your phone's utility when crossing borders. And if I missed any apps that you find helpful, please add them in the comments!\n\nStep 1: Get service abroad\n\nThere's two ways to do this. First is to contact your carrier and ask them to activate your phone for international use. This will add an extra charge to your monthly bill for placing calls, exchanging texts and using data in another country - usually between $50 and $100 per month.\n\nIf your phone is unlocked (which is explicitly allowed by U.S. law), you can also choose to replace your phone's SIM card with one activated for the country you're visiting. This is often cheaper than going through your carrier (usually from $5 to $50 per month) and offers a bigger chunk of data. Ahead of your trip, research which is the most reliable carrier in the country you're visiting, or just ask the locals. You can buy SIM cards at airports, newsstands, or standalone stores - and normally the clerk will help you install it in your device.\n\nNote that most SIM cards will only work in the country where you bought them, so if you're crossing from Spain into France, you're going to need a new SIM for use in France. In all cases, opt for the plan that gives you the most data for your dollar; when traveling abroad, this is the most crucial piece.\n\nPlease note that some countries - notably China, Japan, and South Korea - use different frequencies and systems, which many foreign phones are unable to access. Also keep in mind that most airports have free terminal-wide WiFi or hotspots. Seek these out upon landing for sending that all-important \"I made it safe and sound\" message to your loved ones. And speaking of sending messages...\n\nStep 2: Keeping in touch\n\nKeeping in touch with family and friends is something most folks enjoy while traveling. It's great sending or posting the requisite photos of yourself pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa or kissing the Blarney Stone. Naturally Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and e-mail are all great for this, but here's a few more to consider.\n\nSkype is a great tool for keeping in touch - and not just with video. You can add money to your account and use it to make phone calls from overseas at much better rates than most any calling card you'd buy. You can also exchange text messages and, of course, video chat - just be careful not to burn through your data too fast.\n\nWhatsapp, a messaging app that Facebook snapped-up last year for $19 billion, is the gold standard for most international travelers. It has a dead simple interface for swapping messages, photos, video, audio clips and voice calls with fellow users. Especially for extended trips abroad, encourage your family and friends to download the app to stay in touch with you - it will be your lifeline.\n\nFacebook's standalone Messenger app is also useful for keeping in touch while traveling. Though I find it a bit clunkier than Whatsapp, it's more popular in the States and more of your contacts are likely to be using it, so you may find it more convenient. It can also be used to send photos, video and make voice calls.\n\nAlong with the usual host of social networking apps, Periscope is a fun addition to a traveler's arsenal. The Twitter-owned app lets you livestream video from anywhere you've got a connection, letting the world (or just your family and friends) see what you see in real-time. They can also send you comments and questions along the way. The videos are, by default, archived for 24 hours so anyone who's missed your broadcast can log-on and check it out afterwards.\n\nBe advised that some countries - like China - block Facebook, Gmail, YouTube and a host of other popular apps and websites, so it's wise to set up alternatives (like a Yahoo e-mail account) to use instead. Now you're connected with your peeps - and it's finally time to get out on the town!\n\nStep 3: Getting around\n\nGoogle Maps! Google Maps! Google Maps! I can't stress this enough. Intuitive, reliable, and consistently updated, it always gets you where you want to go by foot, vehicle or mass transit. When driving in foreign countries, its voice feature has also never steered me wrong - though it occasionally decides to take the scenic route.\n\nThe Google Translate app is as close as we've come (so far) to Star Trek's \"universal translator\" and a must-have for most international travelers. The app lets you quickly and easily translate between dozens of languages from Afrikaans to Zulu. It also has some snazzy features. You can take a photo of a printed word and translate it - helpful for street signs, etc. You can write a word on the screen with your finger (even in cursive) and the app will translate it. You can even speak a word or phrase into the phone and the app's digital voice will speak the translation out loud (super cool).\n\nFinally, always remember to turn off your mobile data when you're not using it and take advantage of free WiFi hotspots wherever possible to make the most of those precious megabytes. Happy trails!", "If you Google \"tattoos in the workplace\", you'll find that there are thousands of articles on the topic. The top search engine real estate is dominated by websites like Forbes, USAToday, and Business Insider.\n\nThis article from Forbes published in 2011 argues that tattoos still have a negative impact on employment. In 2013 they recanted, saying tattoos were \"no longer a kiss of death in the workplace\".\n\nThe funny thing is that while these articles were published two years apart and argue the exact opposite points, they support their arguments with the exact same research studies.\n\nIn fact, when you click through to any of these top news sources you'll find that every article on the topic is citing the same three sources: an old Career Builders survey from 2011, a Pew Research report on millennials from 2010, and an infographic designed by a skin boutique (really??).\n\nWow. For a topic that affects millions of people, top news sources are pumping out article after article on the same pathetically thin research sources that they've been using for years.\n\nI took the liberty of looking into actual academic research on tattoos and employment from the last few years, and came up with some interesting conclusions and stats.\n\nHere are a few key findings from the research studies I reviewed that support that attitudes towards tattoos in the workplace may be changing:\n\nHowever there were also findings that tattoos still may be limiting in the workplace. Researchers also revealed that:\n\nLooking at the research, we can definitely see that there has been progress towards the acceptance of tattoos in the workplace, but highly visible tattoos can still have a negative impact, especially in customer-facing jobs.\n\nTattooed professionals often manage their \"business\" and \"tattooed\" selves as separate identities by covering up their tattoos in professional settings, especially upon first impressions, by covering up their tattoos. Some people choose to always cover their tattoos, while others show their tattoos after they have established their professional knowledge and authority.\n\nIf you are concerned about negative impacts of tattoos either in finding employment or rising in your career field, getting tattoos that can be easily covered up is a good way to mitigate the risks of discrimination.", "If Google and other tech giants have shown us anything, it's that technology has the potential to give us abilities we may never have dreamed were possible.\n\nMyles Aronowitz/NetflixCould we all be like Jessica Jones?\n\nWhether it's an implant that helps the blind see or a robotic suit that gives a paralyzed person the ability to walk again, researchers and engineers are increasingly finding new ways to use technology to enhance our senses and improve our bodies.\n\nThat is one reason why futurist Ian Pearson, who is also a fellow at the World Academy for Arts and Science, told Tech Insider that technology will advance to the point where humans can elect to have superpowers in 2050.\n\nHere are some ways he sees humans gaining special abilities:\n\nGoogle\n\nPearson said it will be possible to buy special contact lenses that allow you to zoom in on objects from afar and provide night vision.\n\n\"We already fit military people with goggles that can see in the dark,\" Pearson told Tech Insider. \"All you need to do to get that super sense is, rather than have a headset, incorporate that tech into the body.\"\n\nGoogle filed a patent for contact lenses that measure your glucose levels, body temperature, and even blood alcohol content. Although the contact lenses aren't meant to alter our vision, it shows a growing interest in eye technology.\n\nPearson said developments with sensor technology will make it so we have super touch capabilities, or the ability to automatically learn something about whatever surface or thing we come in contact with. For example, you could touch someone and see his or her oxygen levels.\n\n\"You might want to be able to touch things and learn information, and you can do that using all sorts of detectors you can put on the surface [of your skin],\" Pearson explained.\n\nEngineers at Stanford University have developed plastic skin that can digitally measure pressure. It could be used to restore a sense of touch to burn victims, showing it's very possible to alter how we physically interact with the world.\n\nMichael Dodge/Stringer/Getty Images\n\nAdvancements in the creation of polymer artificial muscles, which have been in the works since as early as the 1990s, could provide us with super strength, Pearson said.\n\nSeveral U.S. researchers hailing from different universities made incredibly strong artificial muscles that could allow robots or humans wearing exoskeletons to have superhuman strength in 2014, IEEE Spectrum reported. The artificial muscles could lift 100 times more weight than average muscles.\n\nBut even if the creation of such artificial muscles is still in the works, the Department of Defense said in October that we are two years away from a real-life Iron Man-like suit that, among other things, helps the wearer lift heavy objects.\n\nGetty/ Rachel Murray\n\nPearson predicts that by 2050, people will be able to wear hearing aids that provide above average hearing capabilities.\n\n\"Making [hearing aids] that reach a different spectrum is really easy to do,\" he said.\n\nThe startup Doppler Labs has actually made wireless earbud devices that augment the average user's hearing, MIT Technology Review reported. For example, you can adjust the bass at a concert or block specific noises like a crying baby.\n\nThat may not be the same as super hearing, but it shows wearables that change how we hear are already being tested.", "Brown Girl Magazine Brown Girl is the premier women's publication tailored for the young millennial South Asian women raised in the Diaspora.\n\nA similar version of this was originally published on theelephantpath.com.\n\nDisclaimer: FOB is an acronym for Fresh Off the Boat and is normally designated for a recent immigrant. A Google search of the term will give you this definition: noun, informal, offensive, a recent immigrant especially regarded as being unassimilated. It is also often used when referring to someone who is not an immigrant but expresses what are considered physical and/or behavioral attributes of a recent immigrant.\n\nAs the co-founder of the Black Women in Sports Foundation once said:\n\n\"Know yourself. Never forget where you came from, and reach back to help someone else come forward too.\"\n\nFor a long period, I had, unfortunately, let the significance of Alpha Alexander's words leave me. I remember scrolling through my newsfeed rolling my eyes at a status my friend wrote about relationships written in broken English, instinctively thinking, \"what a fob.\"\n\nYet, of course, I would never tolerate someone mocking my parents' English, nor their views that I often do not see eye to eye with but respect their right to have. I placed their differences and struggles delicately into another box, one to be admired, protected, sometimes disagreed with, but definitely not mocked. So, then why were my friend's (let's call her 'Anjali' in this instance) differences and challenges any less in that moment--I could not say. I was not alone, though. I would be hard pressed to find a first generation South Asian who has not uttered the word fob if not verbally at least in their minds.\n\nWhen I met 'Anjali' in a different context many years ago on a visit to India, I enjoyed her company and appreciated her generosity. I was thankful for the meaningful details she shared with me without judgment about a country and culture which was mine and familiar, yet like a cousin whom you have not seen in many years, I had to get to know all over again. Now that she began living in America, what made me change how I viewed her? Why didn't I provide the same generosity and lack of judgment she afforded me?\n\nI've come to acknowledge many of us first generation South Asians have fallen prey to a combination of two equally damaging perspectives. The first being a sense of superiority due to our identity as American or Canadian-Indians, otherwise affectionately referred to as NRI or Non-Residential Indians.\n\nThe second is a sense of inferiority due to our identity as children of immigrants who still struggle against racism and discrimination, and perhaps who always will because we wear that marker of our identity on our skin. The latter is a common struggle, one that we can all relate to, and it unites us on an equal playing field. Unfortunately, we allowed the first to divide us into an irrational hierarchy placing us above \"them.\" We become \"better\" than them and arrogant. After all, we are not fobs.\n\nHowever, I am hopeful that we have slowly begun chipping away at this arrogance. The reasons may be many. Perhaps it is our conscience and voice of reason. Perhaps our sense of unity has grown stronger in the context of increasing incidents of discrimination and racism in North America. Perhaps it is because of the powerful voices of first generation youth such as poet and author Rupi Kaur who calls us out on our hypocrisy in her powerful spoken word piece \"Broken English.\"\n\nThe difference in behavior, words and fashion choices of an individual raised in North America compared to a recent immigrant cannot be denied. Yes, we speak, dress and view the world differently--as do all individuals who have grown up in different countries with different experiences. How does this make us better than recent immigrants, or even those immigrants who have been living in North America for a lengthy period of time? By a chance fluke or a series of predestined events, our families happened to immigrate to Canada or the United States before the families that are making their journey now. This was no thanks to us. Our parents struggled and gave us the means to live this life. Again, no thanks to us. Then why the pride, why the judgmental outlook, and why the unkindness to our own people?\n\nOur parents once passed through similar circumstances as those whom we call fobs and laugh at. Often, we will hear our elders' stories of struggle. Even after the passing of decades, they will remember and mention those rare individuals who lent them a helping hand in a strange country and a word of advice or encouragement when they were immersed in self-doubt. We should strive to be more like those people. We should strive to remove the term fob from our vocabulary and instead fill it with kind words, words of support and hope that will build our community, not hinder it.\n\nWe are in a unique position where not only can we understand the challenges new immigrants from the Indian subcontinent face, but we are also well aware of the magnitude of opportunities that await individuals and families when those challenges are overcome. We have seen this story unveiled firsthand in the callused palms of our college-educated parents who spent their lives working in factories. We have witnessed the trials of enduring patience in our mothers who never let their children catch on to the loneliness they were feeling in a strange country, away from family and friends.\n\nAnd today, we witness the unspoken pride and peace in their eyes when they see us climb the ladder of success towards our goals, towards the life they sacrificed to make possible.", "But when Clinton runs in the general, she's in danger of becoming the Democratic Romney.\n\nAt the Republican debate in Houston last night, Marco Rubio nudged the door that Hillary will have to bust wide open when she goes up against Trump in the general election.\n\nRubio got in lick after lick against Trump's supposed strong point and the locus of his greatest vanity: his prowess a businessman. Rubio painted Trump as a slimy \"con artist\" who, if it weren't for his inheritance from his dad, would be \"selling watches in Manhattan.\" (The Rubio campaign is trying to inflate this into a meme by selling broken \"Trump watches\" on its website, which notes, \"You won't actually get a broken Trump watch, but your $10 donation will help Marco stop him.\") Rubio wasn't just saying that Trump oversold his business acumen. He was insisting that the former reality-show star's business practices are a serious character issue.\n\nAnd Rubio may have helped open up a bleeder's cut for Clinton by portraying Trump as a hypocrite about the immigrants his base so loves to hate. Far from building walls to keep them out, Trump hired cheap foreign labor instead of hundreds of willing and ready Americans, as Rubio pointed out. Rube's oppos folder included something about Trump getting sued for hiring undocumented Polish immigrants (\"Google it!\" Rubio said). He went on to say that if Trump were to build \"the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it,\" and that the Trump label manufactures clothing in the same Mexico and China that he says are for stealing American jobs. \"So,\" Marco concluded, \"you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.\"\n\nAnd though it was hard to hear over Trump's protests, Rubio gleefully attacked the real-estate mogul's \"fake university,\" a lawsuit-magnet that charged $36,000 to students who claim they got little in return. \"You know what they got?\" asked Marco. \"They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.\" No wonder, Rubio implied, Trump doesn't want to make his tax returns available, something both Mitt Romney and Ralph Nader, of all duos, hit Trump on this week.", "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your biped Automaton bloggers.

Settlement workers help refugees with basics such as obtaining a health card, and provide tons of advice, from explaining the mysteries of OC Transpo to translating rental contracts.\n\nThey've been scrambling to provide services to 956 Syrians who have arrived in town since early November. The centre has hired about 20 temporary staff and rents rooms at three hotels because there's not enough space at the refugee resettlement house in the ByWard Market.\n\nRelated\n\nSyrians milling around the lobby at the Travelodge chat amiably and help each other out.

It unlocks the potential in every idea.\"\n\nLast year, he said, X killed a project in automated vertical farming -- even though it met X's requirements of combining a huge problem that affects many millions of people with a radical solution and a breakthrough technology \"that could actually be built\".\n\n\"One in nine people suffer from malnourishment,\" he said. \"This technology uses ten times less water and one hundred times less land than conventional farming, and you don't have to transport the crops large distances.\" The team working on the project in Mountain View made progress on automated harvesting and efficient lighting. \"But we couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way, so we killed the project,\" Teller said. \"But if anyone knows how to grow dwarf rice, let us know.\"\n\nHe also said that X had been developing \"variable-buoyancy cargo ships that are lighter than air\" -- and had binned what was looking like a promising technology. \"This has the potential to lower the cost time and carbon footprint of shipping without needing runways -- it's a real moonshot,\" he said. \"We came up with a breakthrough -- helium cells. But it would cost $200 million to design and build the first one. That was way too expensive -- because X is structured with these tight feedback loops of making a mistake and creating new designs.\" $200 mlillion was too much for X to spend to reach the next point of iteration. \"So we killed this project too.\"\n\nQuoting President Kennedy's 1962 call to put a man on the Moon, Teller explained that visions at X must be coupled with workable solutions. \"Great dreams aren't just visions -- they're visions coupled with strategies for making them real.\" X's innovation secret, he said, was a willingness to confront the toughest problems early on in a project's life, and quickly decide when to shut down those that faced excessive obstacles.\n\n\"The Silicon Valley hype machine has created a myth of the visionary who effortlessly builds the future,\" Teller said. \"Don't believe the hype. The moonshot factory is a messy place. But rather than avoid the mess, we try to make that our strength. We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove we're wrong. That's it -- that's the secret. Run at all the hardest parts of the problem first, get excited and cheer: 'Hey, how are we going to kill our project today?'\n\n\"We've got this interesting balance going where we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions, but we also harness enthusiastic scepticism to breathe life into those visions.\"\n\nHybrid thinking is central to X's methodology. \"At X, you'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer, and former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts. Inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies that we hope will make the world a wonderful place: we use the words 'moonshot' to remind us to dream big, and 'factory' to remind us that we need concrete plans to make them real.\"\n\nOne promising moonshot that X is taking to the next stage is Project Loon, its balloon-powered internet that works by sending balloons into the stratosphere from where they beam down a connection.\n\nSince 2012, Teller said, the Loon team has prioritised the work that seems the most difficult and the most likely to kill their project. \"Here comes the crazy part: what if we let the balloons drift and we taught them to sail the winds? Turns out the stratosphere has winds going into quite different speeds and directions. We thought, using smart algorithms and wind data around the world, we could manoeuvre the balloons.\n\n\"The first thing the team did was try to create a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere to the ground. It worked, so we kept going. Could we create a real internet connection? Now we can do up to 15MB a second? Could we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky? Check. Could we get balloons the size of a house to stay up more than 100 days while costing less than five per cent of what traditional long-life balloons cost to make? Yes.\n\n\"We made round silvery balloons, giant pillow-shaped balloons, balloons the size of a blue whale. Since the one thing most likely to kill the balloon project was whether we could guide a balloon through the sky, we put a balloon inside a balloon -- one filled with air, one with helium. The balloon pumps air in to make it heavier or out to make it lighter. That allows it to rise or fall. It floats up and down hoping to grab winds.\n\n\"Our latest balloon can navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky and can navigate to within 500 metres of where it wants to go from 20,000km away. Last year a balloon built inexpensively went round the world 19 times over 187 days -- so we're going to keep going.\" X is in discussions with telco partners throughout the world and will fly over countries such as Indonesia this year for real service testing.\n\nFinding a major flaw in a project does not necessarily kill it, Teller explained. \"Sometimes it sets it on a more productive path. The self-driving car prototype had no steering wheel or brakes. With 1.2 million people dying on the roads a year, it's a natural moonshot. Three and a half years ago we gave retrofitted self-driving cars to other Googlers to find out what they thought of the experience. Yet our plan to have the car do almost all the driving proved a really bad plan: it wasn't safe, as users didn't stay alert in case the car needed to hand control back to them. So we sent the team back to the drawing board.\n\n\"They came up with a beautiful new perspective -- they aimed for a car where you're truly a passenger, where you tell the car where you want to go and push the button and it takes you from point A to point B by itself. Now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles, and they're out every day on the streets of Mountain View and Austin, Texas. The cars team shifted their perspective -- and sometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.\"\n\nX has also used perspective-shifting to tackle wind energy. \"One of my favourite examples of perspective-shifting is wind energy,\" Teller said. \"There's no way we're going to build a better standard wind turbine than the experts -- but we found a way to get up higher in the sky, to get access to faster, more consistent winds, and so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel. Our energy kite spins up using propellers -- and those propellers that lift it up become flying turbines, sending energy back down the tether. We haven't yet found a way to kill this project. And the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get that this could become a cheaper and more deployable wind-power source for the world.\"\n\nHe said that X had also discovered how to engender the mindset that lets employees aim high despite risk of failure. \"Being audacious and working on big risky things makes people inherently uncomfortable,\" he said. \"You can't yell at people and force them to fail fast. They worry. The only way to get people to work on big risky things, audacious ideas, and run at the hardest parts of the problems first, is if you make that the path of least resistance for them. We make it safe to fail. Teams kill their ideas as soon as evidence is on the table as they get rewarded for it. They get applause from their peers. they get hugs and high fives from their manager, they get promoted for it. We have bonused every single person on teams that have ended their projects.\"\n\nTED's curator asked Teller how long it would be until Loon enabled five billion people to come online and enjoy bandwidth fast enough for video streaming. \"Sometime between five and ten years I'd expect it to happen,\" Teller said. \"It will change the world in ways we cannot possibly imagine. There are a lot of people who don't have regular access to electricity, to food, and have a smartphone. It's the internet that's in between them and literacy, economic development, democracy. It will change the world very profoundly.\"", "Google is teaching its artificial intelligence how to understand language by making it predict, and replicate, the works of famous dead authors.\n\nThe company is building systems that are capable of understanding natural language in the same way humans do, with the works of William Shakespeare, Mark Twain and others currently being analysed. \"This work has the potential to enrich products through personalisation,\" Marc Pickett from Google's Natural Language Understanding research group wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nResearchers training the deep neural network -- using the work of authors from Project Gutenberg -- fed the AI an input sentence and asked it to say what would come next. The network is given millions of lines from a \"jumble\" of authors and then works out the style of individual writers. Pairs of lines were given to the system, which made a simple 'yes' or 'no' decision to whether they matched up.\n\nInitially the system didn't know the identity of any authors, but still only got things wrong 17 percent of the time.\n\nBy giving the network an indication of who the authors were, giving it another factor to compare work against, the computer scientists reduced the error rate to 12.3 percent. This was also improved by a adding a fixed number of previous sentences to give the network more context.\n\nGoogle isn't the only company using the work of authors to teach its systems how humans communicate. Facebook's AI is being taught using children's books. Mark Zuckerberg's company has released several data sets being used to train its own neural networks. These, according to the New Scientist, include The Jungle Book, A Christmas Carol, and Alice in Wonderland.\n\nIn a similar test to Google, Facebook presented its neural network with phrases from books and gave it missing words to select from. The overall aim of both products is to create a system that is able to communicate with humans and provide answers to questions; Facebook's M, Apple's Siri and Google Now could all benefit from such technology.\n\nTo take the test one step further, Google's researchers built upon the author analysis technique to try and get the AI to write from beyond the grave.\n\nThe researchers wrote: \"We get the performance and generalisation of the network across all authors and text it learned on, but influenced by what's unique to a chosen author. Combined with our generative model, these vectors allow us to generate responses as different authors.\"\n\nThey also tried to predict the personality of the writers. Google admitted its predictions weren't necessarily \"particularly accurate,\" but said its AI had identified William Shakespeare as a private person and Mark Twain as an outgoing person.\n\n\"When asked 'Who is your favourite author?' and [given] the options 'Mark Twain', \"William Shakespeare\", 'myself', and 'nobody', the Twain model responded with 'Mark Twain' and the Shakespeare model responded with 'William Shakespeare'.\"\n\nAsked who would answer the phone, the AI Shakespeare hoped someone else would answer, while Twain would try and get their first.", "It would cost Apple \"significant\" time and resources to create a new operating system to unlock the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone, the company has said, adding that such a system could never be \"truly destroyed\".\n\nThe company has formally filed a 65-page legal response to the court order saying it should unlock the Syed Farook's iPhone for the FBI. The document, which comes after the company was granted an extension to file its initial response, explains the \"burden\" it has to make the phone's data accessible to the security agency.\n\nThe company said GovtOS -- the name it's given to the theoretical operating system it would create -- would need to be able to \"bypass or disable\" the erase data function on the iPhone; allow electronic, rather than manual, submissions of passwords; and to remove time delays between password entry attempts.\n\n\"Given the complexity of designing, creating, validating, deploying, and eradicating a bespoke operating system such as the government demands, the burden on Apple will increase significantly as the number of requests to Apple increase,\" the motion signed by Lisa Olle, Apple's manager for global privacy and law enforcement team, read.\n\nThe \"design, creation, validation, and deployment\" of the operating system would take \"a substantial portion\" of time to create and require up to ten engineers, Apple claimed.\n\nThe motion said this could be between two to four weeks, with more senior staff also involved in the project. These additional staff would handle project management, quality assurance, a document writer and potentially more staff. Apple went on to say that to meet the FBI's demands it would need to create new elements of code for the unlocking functions, as well as documentation, before signing the software with Apple's cryptographic key.\n\nThe battle of words between the FBI and Apple has intensified since the initial court order. The FBI has claimed it only wants one iPhone unlocked and it is only in the specific case of Farook's device. Countering the claim, Apple said to do so would create a \"dangerous precedent\" that could be applied to situations with other phones and court demands, both in the US and abroad. Major technology firms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google, have also supported Tim Cook's position.\n\nIn its motion to the court Apple added that it would need to create a version of GovtOD for each iPhone it was asked to unlock, and it could \"not be truly destroyed\". Apple wouldn't be able to destroy the code completely as staff would remember parts of it and the process could be replicated.\n\nOlle, in the motion, said: \"If a purpose-built operating system such as the one the government seeks here got into the wrong hands it would open a significant new avenue of attack, undermining the security protections that Apple spent years developing to protect its customers.\"", "Updates to the Google Play Developer Console will help developers gain a better insight on feedback left by users.

Xamarin provides a platform that lets developers build native apps for multiple mobile operating systems without having to maintain multiple code bases.\n\nBy bringing Xamarin into its fold, Microsoft can help Universal Windows Platform developers \"share common app code across Windows, iOS, and Android apps while still delivering fully-native experiences for each of the platforms,\" Gallo noted in a blog post. Microsoft will, however, continue to support its iOS bridge, as well as its Web bridge for HTML-based and JavaScript-based apps and its Project Centennial bridge for Win32 and .NET-based apps.\n\nFocus on Windows Bridge for iOS\n\nSpeculation about Astoria's possible demise began picking up steam in November, when Microsoft announced that the bridge was \"not ready yet.\" The other shoe dropped with yesterday's blog post by Gallo.\n\n\"We received a lot of feedback that having two bridge technologies to bring code from mobile operating systems to Windows was unnecessary, and the choice between them could be confusing,\" Gallo said. \"We have carefully considered this feedback and decided that we would focus our efforts on the Windows bridge for iOS and make it the single bridge option for bringing mobile code to all Windows 10 devices, including Xbox and PCs.\"\n\nHowever, a number of observers have pointed out that there are likely reasons beyond the Xamarin acquisition that persuaded Microsoft to put an end to Astoria. Bringing Google's open source Android code to Microsoft could create potential legal problems and piracy risks, some have noted. Furthermore, putting the spotlight on iOS apps for Windows promises more premium Apple-flavored value for Microsoft, according to other observers.\n\nMixed Reactions\n\nReader comments on the Windows blog were split between those who welcomed Microsoft's move and those who questioned the reason for Astoria's end.\n\n\"You cancelled the Android bridge because 'developers were confused'?\" one commenter wrote. \"That's the most absurd thing I've heard all week.

Her body, still obviously beautiful, represented a much larger portion of the population. For the millions of girls and women in America, it suddenly seemed OK to not be a size zero.\n\nThen 68-year-old three-time cover model Cheryl Tiegs swooped in and burst the collective bubble, stirring a storm of outrage in the process. Asked by E! News if she thought there should be more full-figured women featured in the magazine, her response left more than a few jaws on the floor.\n\n\"Actually I don't like it that we're talking about full-figured women because it's glamorizing them, and your waist should be smaller than 35 (inches), Tiegs said. \"That's what Dr. Oz said, I'm sticking to it. No I don't think it's healthy. Her face is beautiful, beautiful but I don't think it's healthy in the long run.\"\n\nBoom. Just when America was making progress and insecure, overweight people saw a glimmer of hope, the stereotypical pretty girl stepped in and reminded them of what they've probably heard their whole lives: no, in fact, it's not OK.\n\nTiegs seemingly doubled-down on her comments following the interview, posting a since-deleted tweet that read \"To clarify re bodyweight. Being anorexic/bulimic/overweight all connected to health problems. I want all to be as healthy as they can.\"\n\nShe also retweeted a male follower who agreed: \"Spot on!\" Andrew Christiansen (@_archristiansen) wrote. \"Same here being overweight is hell on the body.\"\n\nAnd this is the very fine line that represents the problematic place in which today's society is situated. Tiegs isn't wrong in her assessment based on standard health protocol. Being overweight isn't healthy and it does cause negative effects on a person's general health and wellness in the long run. And, given her clarification, it seems that's what Tiegs was getting at.\n\nBut to hear such sharp words at such a delicate time after making as much progress as our culture finally has seemingly made was devastating to millions of people who grew up hating their bodies and still might today.\n\nThere are approximately 319 million people in America, per Google, 157 million of whom are women, per the United States Census Bureau. It's estimated by the national association for anorexia nervosa and associated disorders that up to 4.2 percent of those women suffer from bulimia nervosa (and similar disorders), while over 68 percent of Americans are overweight or obese.\n\nThe point: Overweight or underweight, those very basic numbers mean over 225 million people in America are unhealthy. So while it's completely fair to call Tiegs' comments about Ashley Graham insensitive, that's the point Tiegs probably meant to get across.\n\nBut it's 2016, America.

Laszlo Bock, senior vice president of people operations for Google, has authored a book titled, Work Rules! Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead. Speaking at a 2015 Wharton People Analytics conference, he called the book \"really an effort to open-source what we learned at Google ... to make work better in other places.\"\n\nBock leads Google's people function globally, which includes \"all areas related to the attraction, development and retention of 'Googlers,'\" to quote his bio. He observed candidly that for too many people in the workforce today, \"work just sucks.... It's just not pleasant; it's a means to an end.\" He pointed out that \"nobody works 40-hour weeks anymore,\" and that if one were to actually calculate it, people spend more time working than they do anything else, including hobbies, being with loved ones and even sleeping. \"If we're going to invest all that time, it should mean something; it should motivate you. You should love it.\"\n\nIn his talk, Bock described some of the innovations he and his team have made at Google to make work more effective and enjoyable. The special sauce, he said, is introducing more analytics into the realm of HR.\n\nHR Needs More Than Just HR People\n\nAccording to Bock, one significant difference about Google's HR division -- or People Operations, as the company calls it -- is that a \"three-thirds\" hiring model is used to staff it. Bock explained that one-third consists of people from traditional HR backgrounds, another third is recruited from strategy consulting and the final third is composed of academics in fields ranging from organizational psychology to physics.\n\n\"If we're going to invest all that time [in working], it should mean something; it should motivate you. You should love it.\"\n\nBock observed that \"each brings something different to the party.\" The traditional HR people, he said, understand Google, have great intuition and can deal well with problematic situations. The consultants understand business in general, and can take a complex problem, structure it and break it down for analysis. And the academics \"actually force us to prove that all this stuff we're [claiming] actually works.\"\n\nFor 30 years, \"HR as a profession has been saying we need a seat at the table, only to be told that [we] need to understand the business first,\" said Bock. But they need to demonstrate more than just \"an understanding of an income statement.... If I say performance management should work a certain way, or that we should stop doing a certain kind of recruitment, that takes more than just understanding the business. That takes analytics.\"\n\nBock described how he and his colleagues changed some basic hiring processes at Google based on experimentation and analysis. One change was to the average number of interviews it took to hire someone. When he first became head of people operations in 2006, building up the staff was a priority. Yet it was taking somewhere between six and nine months to get hired. The absurdly long hiring cycle became notorious: Bock recalled that \"everyone had a story about their bad interview experience with Google,\" and people would eagerly share it with him whether he was out to dinner in a restaurant, looking at houses with a realtor or anywhere else.\n\n\"So we did a lot of math, we did a lot of experiments,\" said Bock. In Work Rules! he credits then-staffing analyst Todd Carlisle with discovering that four interviews were sufficient to predict with 86% confidence whether or not the company should hire someone. The company then instituted this \"Rule of Four,\" and Google's time to hire, according to Bock, \"went from something like six months to 45 days.\" (During Bock's tenure, Google's number of employees has grown from, he writes, from \"6,000 employees to almost 60,000, with 70-plus offices across more than 40 countries.\")\n\nAnd who was Google hiring? Another problem perceived by Bock was that \"we were really biased toward people with fancy degrees.... If you attend Harvard versus being number one at SUNY Binghamton, who does better?\" He quoted findings that showed that the very best students from any school outperformed the average students -- and even the 60-70 percentile students -- at major Ivy League universities. Bock commented, \"So there's actually evidence to suggest [that] as a recruiter, you're better off casting a wider net, which is what we do.\"\n\nThe absurdly long hiring cycle became notorious: Bock recalled that \"everyone had a story about their bad interview experience with Google.\"\n\nGrades, too, have been overrated, said Bock. \"We did a bunch of analysis and found that grades are a little predictive for your first couple of years, but for the rest of your career, they don't matter at all.... What matters is the education you got and your ability to learn.... We know those things are predictive.\" Bock also shifted Google's focus away from SAT scores. He said it had been a mistake for the company to be asking all candidates, some as old as 50, for their SAT scores (and college transcript), often passing on those that didn't score high enough.\n\nPerformance Management at Google\n\nBock has also brought his analytical approach to evaluating existing employees, managers and teams. He described a study of the top quartile of good managers, reviewing their behavior to see what they did differently from less-effective managers. But the only way to truly measure the effect of a manager's performance on his or her team, said Bock, would be to make people switch teams. Although normally that would be \"cruel,\" said Bock, Google provided a natural laboratory for the experiment, because Googlers, as a company policy, routinely switch jobs. So Bock was able to assess whether bad performers working for bad managers improved when they went to work for good ones, and vice versa. He compiled evidence that showed that \"the actions that a manager takes actually have measurable, real consequences in terms of performance.... It was a beautiful, beautiful finding,\" said Bock.\n\nOther HR functions that are handled differently at Google include the well-known (and generally dreaded) annual performance evaluation. Google has a structure whereby employee development feedback is separated from performance feedback. Bock noted that this was instituted because when people receive feedback that they believe threatens their bonus or salary grade, they become defensive and stop listening.\n\n\"We've all worked with people who are kind of struggling, and you go to them and say: 'Hey, things aren't going so well....' [Then,] they devote all kinds of energy toward arguing, 'My performance is fine -- you, manager, just don't get it.'\" Then, said Bock, they spend two weeks documenting their performance themselves. And many managers' typical response will be: \"Oh, just take the bonus.\" At Google, on the other hand, said Bock, \"we want our managers to be open to developing people.... We do that by removing the performance stigma.\"\n\nManagers, too, are evaluated. At Google there are twice-yearly surveys in which employees give upward feedback. The organization has some unique transparency around the reporting of this, although Bock points out that it has limitations. He explained that if an executive has more than 100 direct reports, the survey is made openly available. But executives who have fewer reports get to choose whether or not to make the results public -- a rule based on the idea that a manager's low rating might have been caused by \"a good purpose.\" \"If you have a manager whose ratings look really low ... she [might be] trying to make the team better. She's being really tough, and firing people, and moving people around, [and that's why] the team's going to be unhappy.\" Google doesn't want everyone in the organization to assume this person is a terrible manager, said Bock, when she might be one of the best.\n\n\"[We found that] the actions that a manager takes actually have measurable, real consequences in terms of performance. It was a beautiful, beautiful finding.\"\n\nA Word to the Wise HR Professional\n\nBock noted that getting Google to allow him and his team to establish a robust human resources program has often been an uphill battle, even though he said he has \"fought for performance management from day one.\" He commented that Google is an engineering company, and as such there are some special challenges. \"My brother's an engineer, my dad's an engineer, so I can say this,\" he began. \"[Engineers] are really good at one set of problems, and they're really smart, and so they extrapolate that they're good at all kinds of problems, and know better.\"\n\nIn addition, he said, Google has a culture in which the employees -- who are, of course, engineers -- run the company. So Bock's early attempts to introduce programs like talent management and succession planning were not well received. \"Eric Schmidt [Google's then-CEO] told me, 'That's all a waste of time; that's a terrible idea,' and I thought, 'This is not going well.'\" He said that the mechanism to finally achieve change was to start with small pilot experiments. \"We did a small experiment on only 6,500 of our employees recently where we had around eight different systems running in parallel to figure out what worked the best.\"\n\nBock stated that a company doesn't have to be as big or profitable as Google to run some experiments from its HR department. He advised HR practitioners to \"hire somebody with a quant background and a semester or two of MBA-level statistics. That's all you need ... someone to be able to tell random variation from actual, cause-driven variation.\" He suggested HR professionals think of a problem that both matters to the business and is interesting to them, and examine performance differences between different categories of people. Then they could set up test situations. \"Take two more groups -- it doesn't matter if they're five-person groups or 500-person groups ... and say, 'We're going to treat them differently, and let's see what happens.'\"\n\nBock observed: \"All of our clients, all the people we work with and partner with, they all think they're really good at 'people stuff.' Because our [human] intuition is to think, 'I'm a keen judge of character; I of course, make fair decisions; I'm completely unbiased.' And we all make unfair decisions. We're all biased. So, whenever you can qualify what you're saying with these experiments is a way to get there and improve your credibility.\"", "For procrastinators and focused email inbox managers alike, snooze is a great feature.

We can't wait to clear the haze from China's sky. Integrating electricity, intelligence, connectivity and social media in a vertically integrated system will disrupt all existing car products.\"\n\nIt's an ambitious claim, and all the more so because Jia's electric car ride-sharing company - the US-based Faraday Future - has yet to show a moving vehicle of any kind.\n\nFaraday Future's proposed $1bn assembly plant in Nevada has stalled for lack of cash, the engineer behind its crucial battery system recently quit, and a former Faraday Future executive told the Guardian that the company's first car will be \"no Tesla killer\".\n\nWhile much of the car's engineering is progressing steadily, Faraday Future is struggling to develop self-driving and entertainment systems for its planned driverless taxi services, according to several former executives who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I think they'll probably end up trying to license autonomy from someone like Google,\" said one of the executives.\n\nBased in Los Angeles and with an engineering office in Silicon Valley, Faraday Future was long assumed to be another start-up. In fact, it was formed in April 2014 by Yueting, the billionaire founder of Leshi Internet Information & Technology, or LeTV.\n\nJia's story verges on the melodramatic: born into a rural family that was so poor he holidayed in a steel factory, Jia escaped a life of drudgery by focusing on technology. He worked in a local tax office, then started his own computer training company, a telecoms venture and, in 2004, LeTV.\n\nLeshi: LeTV's mysterious California-based electric car company\n\nLeTV, recently renamed LeEco, has been described as the Netflix of China for its success in streaming video, yet Jia's companies now also make films, televisions, smartphones and even bicycles. Jia famously took just five minutes to persuade Foxconn founder Terry Guo that the company, which makes Apple gear, should also be building LeTV's gadgets.\n\nThen, at the beginning of 2015, LeTV announced that it was establishing the Leshi Super Electric Car Company to build a smart, internet-based electric car, and that the company already had 260 engineers in Silicon Valley.\n\nIn August, Jia gave the vehicle a name - Le Supercar - and revealed that it would be designed by a founding member of Lotus China. The company now claimed to have 600 staff working on the vehicle, which would be ready for the Beijing auto show this April.\n\nYet there is no evidence of the Leshi Super Electric Car Company in California, no record of employees or any evidence it as ever operated there, and neither of the former employees the Guardian spoke to had seen the car. Instead, all the electric car expertise - and all Jia's aspirations for vehicles of the future - appear to rest with Faraday Future instead.\n\nOn 19 February, LeEco announced a joint venture with Aston Martin to develop an electric version of its Rapide S model, though it is not clear whether this work may fall to Faraday Future.\n\nWhere does LeEco end, and Faraday Future begin?\n\nDing Lei, who was credited last week as co-founder of LeEco's auto division (although he only joined the company last September), is also the acting global CEO of Faraday Future, according to the executives. (At one point, Apple was rumoured to be using Faraday Future to develop its own electric self-driving car, but no evidence could be found to link the companies.)\n\nFaraday Future has never officially announced its senior leadership, and says only that it has \"a strategic partnership\" and \"an independent relationship\" with LeEco.\n\nThe companies suffered cultural clashes from the outset. At one point, LeTV managers proposed calling the new company Fara Faro instead of Faraday Future. \"The Americans were like, 'That is the stupidest name ever,'\" remembers an executive. \"You had an international team that was experienced and open, juxtaposed with Chinese management that didn't understand the US market and kept deferring to LeTV.\"\n\nNevertheless, Faraday Future grew rapidly. By September 2014, LeTV had bought the company a 124,000 square foot office building in the suburbs of Los Angeles for $13.25m. Their plans were ambitious: to build a family of 13 super-intelligent electric cars, trucks and minivans sharing a common technical platform. The company has filed for US trademarks for vehicles from FFZERO1 to FFZERO9, and met with officials from California's department of motor vehicles responsible for autonomous vehicle testing on public roads, the Guardian learned through a public records request.\n\nBut as the realities of developing a new vehicle from scratch dawned, Faraday Future reduced its focus to a smaller group of vehicles. \"There were definitely multiple vehicles that were being designed. It would be kind of ridiculous not to take advantage of the variable platform architecture,\" said one executive, referring to a chassis that can be modified with different batteries, motors and even body shapes.\n\nThe first car to be launched is likely to be a luxury vehicle with an extended wheelbase to appeal to business customers. This is about to undergo its first road tests and is scheduled for launch in late 2017. \"It's not really a Tesla killer,\" conceded one former executive. \"It'll be much heavier, longer and bulkier than a Tesla but really sculpted and beautiful.\" The car has been projected to cost upwards of $150,000.\n\nThe company had initially hoped to emerge from stealth and unveil a fully working prototype at the CES trade show in January 2016. But by the summer of 2015, it was clear that the technology would not be ready. Instead, Faraday Future would showcase its design prowess with a concept electric race car that would drive into the press conference. But that vehicle too fell behind schedule. Finally, the company had to scramble to produce a non-functioning, static concept car, costing $2m.\n\nIn January, Faraday Future's chief battery architect, Porter Harris, quit. \"He was the battery,\" said one of the executives. \"He designed it and did all the patents.\"\n\nIs the money drying up?\n\nThere was more bad news ahead. On 7 December, trading in LeTV shares on the Shenzen stock exchange was suspended. This is not uncommon in China, and was supposedly to allow LeEco to incorporate a film distribution company into its listing. The shares were meant to resume trading on 5 January but this was delayed until 31 January, and then again until 7 March.\n\nThis raised the suspicions of Dan Schwartz, state treasurer of Nevada, where Faraday Future is promising to build a $1bn, 3m square foot manufacturing facility. \"It's being built by a company that's in the media and entertainment business and has never made a car in its life,\" said Schwartz in a radio interview earlier this month. Following a trip to China, he told the Los Angeles Business Journal: \"It's the emperor's new clothes. [Jia] isn't making any money. He certainly isn't making any money to fund a billion-dollar car facility.\"\n\nFor its part, the company still lists dozens of job openings in Los Angeles, San Jose and north Las Vegas, and insists that it is \"working out the details\" of its factory deal with Nevada. One former executive said there was never any sign of penny-pinching: \"Vendors got paid, pay checks were always there, and lunches were always supplied.\"\n\nBut Schwartz is now insisting that Faraday Future provide a $75m performance bond - essentially a guarantee that the factory will be built - before Nevada starts work on supporting road, rail and utility projects. That bond has yet to appear. Schwartz said Faraday Future did not assure him the $75m would be available even when LeEco shares are unfrozen next month.\n\n\"Right now, the state is not out any money,\" said Schwartz. \"We'll see what happens after the shares begin trading again.\"\n\nJia himself has seen his personal fortune tumble from a high of nearly $8bn last year to under $5bn today, according to Forbes.\n\n\"For years now, Chinese internet entrepreneurs been able to fuel their domestic and global ambitions on the backs of a red-hot Chinese stock market,\" said Joe Paluska, an adviser to the electric car industry.\n\n\"But now that the bull market has turned into a bear market, they've lost the currency to fuel those ambitions.\"", "Brazilian startups have until March 31 to submit applications to the second edition of Google's Launchpad Accelerator program.\n\nThe acceleration initiative includes six months of technical support and training, as well as up to $50,000 in equity-free financing to startups and a couple of weeks at Google's offices in Mountain View.\n\nBrazilian smartphone games developer UpBeat Games was one of the startups selected in the first edition of the Launchpad Accelerator last year.

(AFP/Nick Shearman)\n\nThe vehicle stopped after detecting sandbags near a storm drain in its path, then waited for a break in traffic to get around the obstruction, the report indicated.\n\nAfter several vehicles passed, the self-driving car eased back into the centre lane believing an approaching transit bus would stop, Google said. The bus did not stop.\n\n\"Our test driver, who had been watching the bus in the mirror, also expected the bus to slow or stop,\" Google said in its monthly report. \"And we can imagine the bus driver assumed we were going to stay put. Unfortunately, all these assumptions led us to the same spot in the lane at the same time.\"\n\nThe self-driving car was moving about 3.2 kilometres per hour when it collided with the side of the bus, which was travelling about 24.1 kilometres per hour, the accident report filed by Google said.\n\nThe accident was reviewed and software modified to \"more deeply understand\" that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield to the self-driving cars, according to Google.\n\nBut critics of the autonomous cars were not so forgiving. \"This accident is more proof that robot car technology is not ready for auto pilot and a human driver needs to be able to take over when something goes wrong,\" Consumer Watchdog privacy project director John Simpson said in a release.\n\n\"The police should be called to the site of every robot car crash and all technical data and video associated with the accident must be made public.\"\n\nGoogle has previously disclosed accidents involving its self-driving cars, but maintained that they resulted from the actions of humans and not its technology.", "Virtual reality is still in its early days, but it's amazing how capable it is of making your bank account look a lot less impressive.\n\nHTC revealed today that is has sold more than 15,000 HTC Vive VR kits in the first 10 minutes after it went on sale for preorder. That's not bad for an unproven technology that costs $800 and requires a $1,000 PC. This comes as companies like Facebook, Google, and Samsung are all moving into this sector. Investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts VR could grow into a $110 billion business by 2020 along with the similar augmented reality tech that mixes digital images with the real world -- and Vive is one of the consumer products that could drive those revenues.\n\nVive is a PC peripheral (from HTC and its partners at Valve) that you wear over your eyes and ears. This enables you to feel like you are inside of a game or a simulated experience. And unlike other VR devices, Vive has a number of extra sensors that can track your movement around a room. This amps up the feeling that you are present in another place, and it is the main selling point of the Vive compared to its competition.\n\nHTC Vive is the second major high-end VR headset to go on sale this year. In January, Oculus VR -- a subsidiary of Facebook -- starting selling its Rift head-mounted display for $600. The company didn't share any numbers about that performance, but the first shipments sold out in a matter of minutes. That pushed new orders from March into April and then into May by the end of the first day. Today, new Rift preorders won't ship until July.\n\nThese early successes are showing that VR has a lot of interest. This is something we've seen with mobile virtual reality and devices like Samsung's Gear VR (that it builds in partnership with Oculus) and the Google Cardboard phone holders. This market is on track for $861 million in spending this year.\n\nMany people have wondered if the build up to VR over the last few years will lead to any money, and now we have several products where consumers are showing they're ready to part with their cash.

In a leaked image discovered by Android Police, we get our first glimpse at what changes it can expect when Android N rolls around.\n\nAs you can see, the notifications shade looks like it'll provide quite a bit more info per notifications, and the height of each notification has been stretched to accommodate this. In Lollipop, notifications on the shade have a card-like feel with gaps of negative space between each one. N looks like it's filling up these gaps. While both have a very sleek, Material Design look, N opts for a lengthy sheet of contiguous paper over the card layout. We assume they will still be swipe-able.\n\nMoreover, the quick settings panel seems to be one tap quicker than it is on Lollipop. What appear to be quick toggle buttons ride atop the shade so that major tools and services, like wifi connectivity and your flashlight, can be accessed immediately rather than in a larger pull-down menu. It seems that the full quick options menu is available if you pull down once more, but this is a way to provide valuable utility to a part of the screen that wasn't used this efficiently before.\n\nGranted, this is a very early shot of Android N, and we wouldn't be surprised at all to see this tossed out, revamped, or overhauled completely by the time the Android version officially starts hitting devices.

But boy, what a ride it was. I'll spare everyone my thoughts on how awesome the show was, because let's face it, essentially everyone who calls themselves anime fans (and even a bunch of people who don't) watched it and loved every second of it. What I will say, though, is that my personal favorite part of the show was the spot-on satire. Yeah, the rest was great, but that's where I feel the show really shines. However, I feel like a lot of people really missed the joke.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Studio Madhouse\n\nFor the last few months, like 90% of the posts I've seen on Google+ have been something to the effect of, \"Who would win in a fight, SSJSSG 86 Evolved Extra Shiny Chrome Super Goku or Saitama!?!?!?!111!?\" And then the thread usually evolves into an argument over who is more invincible. Now I know that this isn't a great example for measuring general reactions to the show - Google+'s anime community has a pretty young demographic (mostly kids abusing the fact that G+ isn't blocked by many school filters). Nevertheless, it's a bit disheartening that so many people could completely miss the point.\n\nAfter all, the whole point of One Punch Man is, I think, to demonstrate just how absurd and melodramatic the aforementioned Goku-type heroes (and villains) are. Case in point: this clip. Saitama's irritation at Genos's long-winded backstory is, similar to how he deals with villains, a simple dismissal of things we often take for granted in anime. Of course the hero needs a deep, tragic backstory. Of course there needs to be a dramatic set-up for the hero's self-sacrifice as he begs his mentor for forgiveness.\n\nUnfortunately, many people seem to have just taken this at face value - assuming that One Punch Man is just a well animated, quirky action show. Perhaps I shouldn't be too surprised - the satire here is certainly not presented as openly as the likes of The Onion, and yet, plenty of people still completely miss the joke.\n\nThen again, maybe One Punch Man really is just an unorthodox fighting anime. The Evangelion nerd in me certainly is no stranger to overanalyzing. However, I think that the idea of rejecting everything we take for granted is pretty important if we want to see anime, as a medium, go on producing even more interesting characters and stories. Actually, I'm excited by how much I see this sort of thing going on outside of One Punch Man - for instance, Concrete Revolutio. It gives me some hope that we'll keep seeing new ideas in anime with each season.\n\nThat said, I'll leave you with a Genos meme.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Studio Madhouse\n\nMichael Mauer is a sophomore in the college of Arts and Sciences majoring in Computer Science.

He indicated Congress, not federal judges, should solve the conflict.\n\n\"How best to balance those interests is a matter of critical importance to our society, and the need for an answer becomes more pressing daily, as the tide of technological advance flows ever farther past the boundaries of what seemed possible even a few decades ago,\" Orenstein wrote. \"But that debate must happen today, and it must take place among legislators who are equipped to consider the technological and cultural realities of a world their predecessors could not begin to conceive.\"\n\nThe ruling is likely to provide legal fodder to Apple's side as the company and FBI square off in federal court in Riverside County over Apple's refusal to comply with an order requiring it to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino County shooters. A federal magistrate there is scheduled to hold a hearing in the case on March 22.\n\nWhile Apple is raising broader constitutional arguments in the California case and the technology involved is distinct, company officials said Monday that Orenstein's ruling could influence the San Bernardino legal battle.\n\n\"It's directly on point,\" said a senior Apple executive who asked not to be identified. \"This is the first time a court has looked specifically at the issue.\"\n\nJustice Department officials expressed disappointment in the ruling, indicating they plan to ask a district court judge -- which outranks a magistrate -- to reconsider. \"This phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,\" a department spokesman said.\n\nApple, backed by the tech industry, argues that the FBI's demands threaten the privacy and security rights of millions of iPhone users around the world. The company recently disclosed in the Brooklyn case that it has already received at least a dozen FBI requests to unlock iPhones since last fall, and anticipates many more from the government if it loses in the courts.\n\nU.S. Justice Department officials have downplayed Apple's security arguments, contending the government is seeking technical help to aid in a crucial terrorism investigation that does not pose a wider threat to consumer privacy and digital security.\n\nOrenstein has been weighing the government's bid to force Apple to unlock the iPhone in the drug case since October. But the issue exploded into the public eye two weeks ago, when another magistrate judge in Riverside County ordered Apple to crack the security of the iPhone 5C of one of the San Bernardino County shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed after he and his wife gunned down 14 people in a terror attack.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym is now weighing the conflicting arguments of Apple and Justice Department lawyers. A number of tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, are expected to weigh in with arguments supporting Apple later this week.\n\nPym is not bound by Orenstein's decision, and her earlier order reached a different conclusion, requiring Apple to unlock the iPhone but giving the company an opportunity to lodge opposing legal arguments.\n\nIn addition, the rulings from both judges are expected to wind up in the federal appeals courts -- in fact, Apple has pledged to take its case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and FBI director James Comey said last week he expects the San Bernardino case to set precedent on the issue.\n\nBoth the New York and California cases center on whether the 1789 All Writs Act, a catch-all law that gives the courts power to order individuals or businesses to take action, provides the legal authority to compel Apple to create the tech needed to unlock an iPhone.\n\nOrenstein specifically found that old law, crafted in the time of parchment and ink, did not cover that power.\n\nThe New York case, however, involves an older operating system than the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, a key factor to Apple, which argues the judge in California is asking the company to create a tech method to hack the phone that currently does not exist.\n\nHoward Mintz covers legal affairs.

So tread with caution.\n\nBut it suggests that Microsoft is gaining a lot of ground on Google in schools. Google's Chromebooks, which can be found for as low as $149, are super-lightweight laptops that run Chrome OS, basically a modified version of the Google Chrome browser.\n\nMicrosoft brags in its blog post that Windows' rising classroom popularity is due to the fact that it's available on a wide range of devices, from cheap sub-$200 laptops all the way up to the premium Surface Pro 4 tablet.\n\nThat means a wider availability than before of cheap laptops that also run a full, versatile version of Windows, versus the Chromebooks' limitations (which are entirely web-browser based). Plus, Microsoft says that Windows is easier for a school's IT team to manage than the competition.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft brags that Futuresource's data shows a 20% increase in Windows device shipments to grade schools over 2014. The devices tracked by the report includes laptops and tablets, but not desktop PCs.\n\nNotably, the number is inclusive of all versions of Windows: While many of those devices sold probably run the new Windows 10 operating system, it only came out in July of 2015. That means that many of those laptops and tablets were running Windows 8. It's an important point as Microsoft's march to a billion Windows 10 users continues.\n\nSchools and education are an intensely desirable market for the biggest tech companies in the world. In a world increasingly ruled by the Internet, there's a lot of money to be made selling devices directly to schools.

The Mountain View, California-based Internet search leader said it made changes to its software after the crash to avoid future incidents.\n\nAlthough Google cars have been incolved in accidents before, the company has always said its self-driving technology was not to blame.\n\nIn a report filed with California regulators, Google said the crash took place in Mountain View on February 14 when a self-driving Lexus RX450h tried to skirt around some sandbags in a wide lane.\n\nGoogle said in the filing the autonomous vehicle was traveling at less than 2 miles per hour, while the bus was moving at about 15 miles per hour.\n\nThe vehicle and the test driver \"believed the bus would slow or allow the Google (autonomous vehicle) to continue,\" it said.\n\nBut three seconds later, as the Google car in autonomous mode re-entered the centre of the lane, it struck the side of the bus, causing damage to its left front bomper, front wheel and a driver side sensor. No-one was injured in the car or on the bus.\n\nGoogle said in a statement on Monday that \"we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision. That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that.\"\n\nGoogle CEO Eric Schmidt, outside of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California Photo: AP\n\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority will investigate the circumstances of the accident, Stacey Hendler Ross, spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, said on Monday.\n\nShe said the Google car caused minor damage to the bus, striking the \"pivoting joint,\" or flexible area in the middle of the articulated bus. After the crash, 15 passengers on the bus were transferred to another bus.\n\nAn investigation to determine liability is pending, she said.\n\n* Google's driverless cars have needed hundreds of human interventions to stop accidents\n\nJohn Simpson, privacy project director for advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said the crash \"is more proof that robot car technology is not ready for auto pilot\".\n\nA spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Monday it will speak to Google to gather additional information, but added \"the DMV is not responsible for determining fault\".", "While it might sound like putting a self-driving car on public roads is a recipe for an accident, so far Google has been pretty successful with their efforts. Sure, the car and its technology have gotten into multiple accidents over the years, but if there is one thing we need to point out, it is that it has never been Google's fault, meaning that so far, it has been other drivers crashing into their cars.\n\nThat is, at least until now. It seems that recently Google's self-driving car has gotten into an accident that was completely their fault when they collided into the side of a bus. Thankfully this was a minor accident that left only the vehicles damaged (Google's front fender, wheel, and sensors were damaged in the process) with its occupants unharmed.\n\nGoogle has since explained what caused the accident, in which it basically boiled down to assumptions in which both parties assumed that the other would stop and give way to them. \"This is a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving -- we're all trying to predict each other's movements. In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.\"\n\nThey also noted that they have since refined their software to take into account drivers of larger vehicles who apparently are less likely to yield compared to other vehicles. \"From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future.\"", "Chromecast Audio offers a slick multiroom option which lets you group speakers throughout your home and play music perfectly in sync.\n\nA cheap and easy way to fling music around your home, Google's Chromecast Audio adaptor gives any speaker a wireless overhaul.\n\nAt $69 for the tiny Chromecast Audio adaptor you're entitled to set your expectations low, but it's actually surprisingly good and stands up well against more expensive options like Apple's Airport Express adaptors.\n\nLike Apple's gear, the Chromecast Audio offers a slick multiroom option which lets you group speakers throughout your home and play music perfectly in sync.\n\nYou need to supply your own powered speakers or amp, the Chromecast Audio is simply a wi-fi-enabled dongle.\n\nThis means you can upgrade your speakers over time, although I'd recommend using matching speakers in adjacent rooms when you're running multiroom audio to avoid a harsh transition as you walk between rooms.\n\nSET UP\n\nYou configure the Chromecast Audio adaptors using the Chromecast app for Android or iOS.\n\nThe audio adaptors generate their own wi-fi network so you simply connect to that network, give the adaptor a name and tell it the password to your home wi-fi network.\n\nThankfully Google's audio adaptors support both 2.4 and 5GHz wireless networks, with 5GHz your best option to avoid local interference and choppy playback.\n\nYou can't stream via Bluetooth, although the adaptor does utilise Bluetooth to provide guest access for people who aren't connected to your wi-fi network. They can tap on the Cast icon in a compatible music app and their device will listen out for an ultrasonic authorisation signal from the Chromecast Audio.\n\nSTREAMING MUSIC\n\nSending music to your speakers is easy. The Chromecast Audio shows up as an available speaker when you click on the dropdown Cast menu in compatible apps. It's similar to Apple's Airplay streaming music ecosystem, but these adaptors are not compatible with Airplay so you can't stream from iTunes.\n\nYour speakers make a reassuring beep when your device connects to the adaptor, a sound which can be disabled, but you'll want to leave it on while you grow comfortable with the system because the adaptors can be very slow to connect sometimes.\n\nYou'll find support for Chromecast Audio streaming in a range of mobile apps including Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Deezer, NPR One, 7digital, Plex and others. Streaming works with Android and Apple devices, along with desktop browsers.\n\nIf you've got your eye on a Google Music Family subscription be aware that you can only set it up via an Android device - the kind of frustrating restriction you'd expect from Apple but not Google.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nAt this point you're obviously at the mercy of your speakers. I tested two Chromecast Audio adaptors, each connected to a decent set of powered 2.1-channel Harman Kardon Soundsticks II speakers.\n\nThe Chromecast Audio is powered via micro-USB using the supplied AC adaptor. There's also a combination analogue/digital audio output, so you can plug in practically any speakers which feature a 3.5mm input or else connect to the SP/DIF digital audio input on an amplifier.\n\nIf you're really fussy about sound quality you'll find that music from Chromecast Audio's analogue output sounds a tad flat and murky when compared to streaming via an Airport Express. It's only a subtle difference, to be fair it didn't bother me too much once I stopped specifically listening for it.\n\nInitially I suspected the underwhelming sound quality was due to the Chromecast Audio featuring a cheap Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC), the gizmo which turns all the ones and zeros into sound.\n\nBut dig around in the Chromecast app's advanced settings and you'll find a Full Dynamic Range option which is disabled by default for the analogue output. Enabling this improves the sound, but you might only notice the difference if you're using decent speakers and high-quality content.\n\nAudiophiles will also be pleased to hear that the Chromecast Audio handles 96KHz/24-bit lossless audio playback, something Airplay and Sonos don't support.\n\nA BUM NOTE\n\nConnected to my 5GHz network the Chromecast Audio adaptors were rock solid for a few hours, streaming from Apple and Android devices as well as Google Play Music running in the Chrome browser on my Mac. Then everything went haywire.\n\nFor no apparent reason my iPhone sputtered for 15 minutes and then surprisingly asked for the Guest PIN even though it had been happily streaming across my wi-fi network all morning.\n\nAt that point everything went to hell and none of my devices could connect to the adaptors. Eventually I was forced to perform factory resets on both adaptors, as well as restart my wi-fi network.\n\nThis naturally shook my faith in Google's Chromecast Audio adaptors, even though disabling Guest mode seems to solve the problem. I still have to say they're far more reliable than Apple's Airplay, which in my home has been a flaky mess since about iOS7.\n\nThe sad truth is that wireless streaming can be a dark art and your mileage may vary for a myriad of reasons which can be hard to pin down. The only truly bulletproof streaming music system I've ever tested is Sonos which generates its own private 5GHz mesh network.\n\nSO WHAT'S THE VERDICT?\n\nThe Guest mode hiccup spoiled a great first impression but tat aside the Chromecast Audio is an amazing little gadget.\n\nIf Airplay's flakiness is putting a dent in your household harmony, as it has in mine, then it's certainly worth trying out Google's alternative.\n\nAt this point I'm expecting to rip out all of my unreliable Airport Express base stations and replace them with Chromecast Audio adaptors.\n\nI still say Sonos is the gold standard when it comes to multiroom audio in terms of functionality, ease of use and sound quality. If you're purchasing Chromecast Audio adaptors you'll still need to spend good money on decent speakers to rival Sonos' sound quality.\n\nBut if you're looking to dip your toe into wireless multiroom audio without spending a bundle, Google's Chromecast Audio will certainly be music to your ears.", "Organizations can now use OCR to scan attachments for sensitive data\n\nGoogle has expanded the digital loss protection features in Gmail for Work, to help ensure that employees don't share confidential information outside the company they work for.\n\nThe service can now use optical character recognition on attachments, so administrators can ensure that employees aren't sharing mounds of confidential data in images (whether intentionally or not).

No one has been seriously injured.\n\nGoogle's written statement called the Feb. 14 collision \"a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving - we're all trying to predict each other's movements.\"\n\nGoogle said its computers have reviewed the incident and engineers changed the software that governs the cars to understand that buses may not be as inclined to yield as other vehicles.\n\nA spokeswoman for California's DMV, which regulates Google's testing of about two dozen Lexus SUVs in the state, said the agency hoped to speak Monday with Google. Under state law, Google must retain data from the moments before and after any collision.\n\n\"As far as he-said she-said, there shouldn't be any of that. It's all there,\" said Robert W. Peterson, an insurance law expert at Santa Clara University who has studied self-driving cars.\n\nA critic of Google's self-driving car efforts said the collision shows the tech giant should be kept from taking onto public streets self-driving prototypes it built without a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nGoogle sees that as the next natural step for the technology, and has pressed California's DMV and federal regulators to authorize cars in which humans have limited means of intervening.\n\n\"Clearly Google's robot cars can't reliably cope with everyday driving situations,\" said John M. Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog. \"There needs to be a licensed driver who can takeover, even if in this case the test driver failed to step in as he should have.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story had been corrected to show that Google began testing on city streets in 2014, not 2015.\n\nAP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed from San Francisco.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But don't go rushing over to your nearest Mickey D's just yet, as this promo is limited to one country at the moment, and it's not the US or the UK. Oddly, it's Sweden (of all the places!). But the company suggested to AdWeek that this is merely first trial run and therefore could be expanded if the box headsets end up being a hit among Swedes.\n\nMcDonald's Sweden had dubbed its Google Cardboard-inspired creation \"Happy Goggles\" and plans to make 3,500 of them available at 14 restaurants during the two weekends of 5 March and 12 March.

So, marketing gimmicks? Yes. Do we care? Nope. Just gimme gimme!", "The minor scrape took place on February 14, in Mountain View, California. A Google self-driving car was in the right-hand turn lane, wanting to turn right, but then found its way blocked by sandbags, which meant that it had to merge back into the traffic on its left. It allowed \"a few cars\" to pass, and then decided to squeeze in ahead of a public transit bus. But the bus driver didn't hit the brakes, which would have allowed the Google car to merge. The result? \"Body damage to the left front fender,\" according to the accident report, and a lot of unexpected work for Google's PR team.\n\nThis accident should not only have been expected, it's entirely welcome. Google's self-driving cars have driven more than one million miles to date, with a safety record far superior to any human who might have driven that much. But if any car drives for long enough, it will eventually get into an accident that is at least in part its own driver's fault.\n\nGoogle's internal report into the incident says that \"we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.\" But that's true at a much bigger level: the only way to avoid any kind of collision is not to move. Which pretty much defeats the purpose of being a car.\n\nIn this case, the Google car was undertaking one of the most complex social interactions that ever face any driver. Two lanes of traffic had to merge into one, and the lane on the left had right of way, and the Google car was in the lane on the right. Given that this is Mountain View, if the Google car waited for a wide-open space before it entered the left-hand lane, it could have been waiting for hours.\n\nWhich means that the Google car, in this situation, did exactly what it should have done. To be sure, it could have simply sat there, motionless, for an hour or so, until the way was unequivocally clear. But that's not what anybody wants self-driving cars to do. They need to follow the rules of the road, but they also need to get to where they're going, and display the minimum level of aggression necessary to achieve that goal.\n\n999 times out of 1,000, a car as careful as Google's will be allowed into traffic without any problem. But every so often a bus driver will be distracted, or annoyed, or careless - and, in that case, the Google car will be at fault in an accident. It's safe to say, however, that if the bus had been a self-driving Google bus, this accident would not have happened. It was clear what the car was trying to do, and a constantly-alert bus driver would have let the car do exactly that.\n\nObviously, every time there's any kind of accident involving a Google self-driving car, Google needs to take a very hard look at exactly what happened. But even when the car is legally at fault, that doesn't mean there was some kind of software error. The only way to avoid this kind of accident entirely is not to drive at all.\n\nGreg Ip, the chief economics commentator at the Wall Street Journal, is no expert on self-driving cars, but he has written a book called Foolproof: Why Safety Can be Dangerous and How Danger Makes Us Safe. \"It's ridiculous to aim for a zero-accident car,\" he says: \"a zero-accident car is no car, which is not an optimal solution.\" The important thing is to be significantly safer than human-driven cars, rather than to try to achieve no accidents at all.\n\nWhat's more, it doesn't make much if any difference which car is legally at fault. If a Google car brakes too sharply at a red or yellow light and ends up getting rear-ended, the car behind it is legally at fault, but the Google car still caused the accident. The goal should be to minimize accidents, rather to get caught up on legal liability. At some point, we'll move to a world of 100% self-driving cars, and at that point complex interactions with human drivers will be a thing of the past. But for the time being, driving technology has to work with human fallibility, regardless of what the various drivers should be doing.\n\nSo let's celebrate the fact that Google has built enough risk into its cars that they occasionally cause an accident. (And let's celebrate, too, the fact that when that accident finally occurred, it caused only a tiny bit of damage, and that all of the damage was to the car itself.) If the Google self-driving car is to become a useful piece of technology, it needs to take risks occasionally. The Valentine's Day fender-bender proves that it's doing exactly that.", "Google says this is the first collision for which the car (and the company) bears any responsibility.\n\nWhile being tested in California on Valentine's Day, one of Google's self-driving cars clipped a public bus in what may be the first fender bender that was the fault of an autonomous vehicle. Google's automated Lexus SUV was swerving out of the way of some sandbags in the street in Mountain View, California, when its left front bumper hit the right side of the bus. It was doing all of two miles per hour at the time; the bus was doing about 15. Nobody got hurt. The accident report does not specify who was at fault, reports the Associated Press.\n\nThese test cars are required to have a driver at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. Google said in a statement on Monday: \"We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision. That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that.\" The company says it's reviewing the accident and teaching its cars (!) about the possibility of unyielding buses.\n\nIn November, Google said that its autonomous cars have been involved in 17 minor accidents over more than 2 million miles of tests. Mostly, the cars were hit from behind, and the company has said that none of the other incidents were the cars' fault. Google has frequently pointed out that, of the thousands of minor accidents that occur each year, 94 percent result from human error.", "Googling how to rob a bank is never a good idea.\n\nPanhandle investigators learned James Alexander came to the Sunshine State from The Big Easy just to rob a bank -- and looked up how to pull off the heist on Google, cops said, reports WMBB ABC News-13 in Panama City.\n\nAlexander allegedly had a cabbie unwittingly wait for him outside a bank he was robbing and then drive him to a bus station, where he was appropriately BUSted.\n\nHey, bud, want to try googling \"jail escape?'\n\nGet the DUHtails at WMBB ABC News-13.\n\nMore FloriDUH", "Apple and Google are respectively the number one and number two largest publicly traded companies (as measured by market capitalization) in the world. So it's anything but surprising that each company dominates the discourse among technology investors and followers on a daily basis. Below are three visualizations of how both Apple and Google's market capitalization and valuation as measured by price to forward earnings, have evolved over the years, (each year ending in mid-February). In the third chart below, we combine the two charts and remarkably, both companies have taken very similar paths to the current incarnations.\n\nInvestbrain\n\nExpensive Multiples Are Sometimes Justified\n\nStarting with Apple, the first chart above captures in a unique way how phenomenal of a run investors who were relatively early to the Apple story were able to have. What's interesting is the relationship between the company's earnings multiple over time - while purchasing a share of Apple in 2005 (before the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, App Store) for north of 40x earnings seemed highly expensive, retrospectively investors were paying for the opportunity to more than quintuple their money over 5 years, representing a more than 40% annual internal rate of return.\n\nInvestbrain\n\nGoogle's Last 5 Years Have Crushed The 5 Before It\n\nThis might come as a surprise to a lot of investors, and is somewhat counter-intuitive. Google's market capitalization has increased 2.5x over the last 5 years (2011-2016) while only increasing 1.8x over the preceding 5 years (2006-2011). Now of course the 2008 recession didn't help matters but given that the business has matured in recent years as well as grown tremendously, you would expect the opposite to be true.\n\nInvestbrain\n\nIt Took The iPad for Apple To Overtake Google\n\nThe above chart pits the two companies together. As one can see Google had a larger market capitalization than Apple for many years, but that changed in 2010 which was the year the iPad was introduced proving once again the company's ability to innovate and create new categories. Apple's revenue growth accelerated to 52% that year, helped by over $4 billion in iPad sales.\n\nApple's Best Year Was The 12 Months Ended February 2015\n\nThe 12 month period over which Apple increased its market capitalization the most ended on February 2015, with the company adding $306 billion to its market capitalization! For context, that's equivalent to adding Facebook's current market cap with $15 billion to spare. The significance of this period is the iPhone 6. The company launched the phone in September of 2014, and in the two quarters that followed sold $91 billion worth of iPhones, close to the $101 billion it sold in the entire preceding fiscal year.\n\nGoogle's Best Year Was The 12 Months Ended December 2015\n\nThe 12 month period over which Google increased its market capitalization the most ended in December of last year. The company gained $191 million in market capitalization over this period. The driver behind this is two-fold. The first driver we wrote about last year and can be found here. The second, has to do with the formation of Alphabet, which not only demonstrated management's focus on profitability going forward, but increased transparency which investors had wanted for a long time.\n\nApple Has Traded At A Discount To Google With One Exception\n\nHistorically Apple has traded at a discount to Google on earnings, with the one exception being the financial crisis and ensuing recession in 2008. This makes sense as out of the two companies Google had the higher economic sensitivity given that the entirety of its business was advertising-related which is arguably the most economically-sensitive business out there.", "Intravenous hangover clinics don't work, could land you in hospital\n\nAlphabet has filed an accident report with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, in which it says one of its autonomous cars had a low-speed bingle with a bendy-bus.\n\nThe report says its self-driving kitted-up Lexus found itself baulked by sandbags at an intersection.\n\nThe car \"was travelling in autonomous mode eastbound on El Camino Real in Mountain View in the far right-hand lane approaching the Castro St intersection\".\n\nAfter signalling that it wanted to make a right-hand turn and stopping at the intersection, \"the Google AV had to come to a stop and go around sandbags positioned around a storm drain that were blocking its path\".\n\nIt was while reversing that the bus approached from behind. The vehicle's test operator thought the bus would stop, but \"approximately three seconds later, as the Google AV was reentering the center of the lane, it made contact with the side of the bus.\"\n\nThe whole thing involved only minor damage and no injuries, since the Google-mobile was travelling at less than two miles per hour and the bus at just 15 mph.\n\nThe Valentine's Day accident is feasibly the first time one of Google's robo-carshas been involved in an accident it \"caused\". However, The Register notes, Google's test operator made the judgement that the bus was probably going to give the car space to reverse. So a human factor was at play here, not just a failure of machine thinking. \u00ae", "Organizations can now use OCR to scan attachments for sensitive data\n\nGoogle has expanded the digital loss protection features in Gmail for Work, to help ensure that employees don't share confidential information outside the company they work for.\n\nThe service can now use optical character recognition on attachments, so administrators can ensure that employees aren't sharing mounds of confidential data in images (whether intentionally or not).

They can tap on the Cast icon in a compatible music app and their device will listen out for an ultrasonic authorisation signal from the Chromecast Audio.\n\nSTREAMING MUSIC\n\nSending music to your speakers is easy. The Chromecast Audio shows up as an available speaker when you click on the dropdown Cast menu in compatible apps. It's similar to Apple's Airplay streaming music ecosystem, but these adaptors are not compatible with Airplay so you can't stream from iTunes.\n\nYour speakers make a reassuring beep when your device connects to the adaptor, a sound which can be disabled, but you'll want to leave it on while you grow comfortable with the system because the adaptors can be very slow to connect sometimes.\n\nYou'll find support for Chromecast Audio streaming in a range of mobile apps including Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Deezer, NPR One, 7digital, Plex and others. Streaming works with Android and Apple devices, along with desktop browsers.\n\nIf you've got your eye on a Google Music Family subscription be aware that you can only set it up via an Android device - the kind of frustrating restriction you'd expect from Apple but not Google.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nAt this point you're obviously at the mercy of your speakers. I tested two Chromecast Audio adaptors, each connected to a decent set of powered 2.1-channel Harman Kardon Soundsticks II speakers.\n\nThe Chromecast Audio is powered via micro-USB using the supplied AC adaptor. There's also a combination analogue/digital audio output, so you can plug in practically any speakers which feature a 3.5mm input or else connect to the SP/DIF digital audio input on an amplifier.\n\nIf you're really fussy about sound quality you'll find that music from Chromecast Audio's analogue output sounds a tad flat and murky when compared to streaming via an Airport Express. It's only a subtle difference, to be fair it didn't bother me too much once I stopped specifically listening for it.\n\nInitially I suspected the underwhelming sound quality was due to the Chromecast Audio featuring a cheap Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC), the gizmo which turns all the ones and zeros into sound.\n\nBut dig around in the Chromecast app's advanced settings and you'll find a Full Dynamic Range option which is disabled by default for the analogue output. Enabling this improves the sound, but you might only notice the difference if you're using decent speakers and high-quality content.\n\nAudiophiles will also be pleased to hear that the Chromecast Audio handles 96KHz/24-bit lossless audio playback, something Airplay and Sonos don't support.\n\nA BUM NOTE\n\nConnected to my 5GHz network the Chromecast Audio adaptors were rock solid for a few hours, streaming from Apple and Android devices as well as Google Play Music running in the Chrome browser on my Mac. Then everything went haywire.\n\nFor no apparent reason my iPhone sputtered for 15 minutes and then surprisingly asked for the Guest PIN even though it had been happily streaming across my wi-fi network all morning.\n\nAt that point everything went to hell and none of my devices could connect to the adaptors. Eventually I was forced to perform factory resets on both adaptors, as well as restart my wi-fi network.\n\nThis naturally shook my faith in Google's Chromecast Audio adaptors, even though disabling Guest mode seems to solve the problem. I still have to say they're far more reliable than Apple's Airplay, which in my home has been a flaky mess since about iOS7.\n\nThe sad truth is that wireless streaming can be a dark art and your mileage may vary for a myriad of reasons which can be hard to pin down. The only truly bulletproof streaming music system I've ever tested is Sonos which generates its own private 5GHz mesh network.\n\nSO WHAT'S THE VERDICT?\n\nThe Guest mode hiccup spoiled a great first impression but tat aside the Chromecast Audio is an amazing little gadget.\n\nIf Airplay's flakiness is putting a dent in your household harmony, as it has in mine, then it's certainly worth trying out Google's alternative.\n\nAt this point I'm expecting to rip out all of my unreliable Airport Express base stations and replace them with Chromecast Audio adaptors.\n\nI still say Sonos is the gold standard when it comes to multiroom audio in terms of functionality, ease of use and sound quality. If you're purchasing Chromecast Audio adaptors you'll still need to spend good money on decent speakers to rival Sonos' sound quality.\n\nBut if you're looking to dip your toe into wireless multiroom audio without spending a bundle, Google's Chromecast Audio will certainly be music to your ears.", "Most of us only think about our router when it's not working. When the Wi-Fi goes down we unplug the router, plug it back in, then hope our precious, life-giving Internet is flowing once again. If it is, we immediately go back to not thinking about our router.\n\nIf you're happy with your Wi-Fi signal, that might be enough. But increasingly, people aren't. Dead areas in homes are a frequent frustration, and activities like 4K streaming and video conferencing can stretch Wi-Fi bandwidth and reliability to its breaking point.\n\nLinksys is hoping you'll consider the EA7500 as a solution to these, and other, problems. It's a $200 router powered by a 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, offering up to 1.9Gbps of bandwidth you can use across multiple devices. That's enough bandwidth to handle a home full of streamers and gamers. Better still, the router's use of MU-MIMO means the signal is directed directly at those devices, instead of being scattered across the entire house.\n\nIt's an impressive feature set, but can this Linksys router solve your Wi-Fi problems? Is it simple enough for everyday users to set up on their own? And if so, is it worth the $200 price tag?\n\nThe EA7500 is a plastic black box that's not trying to make any visual statements. Sure, the adjustable wing-shaped antennas wouldn't look out of place on a sci-fi set, but the rest of the router looks like any other piece of network equipment.\n\nThat isn't to say the EA7500 fails to stand out. It does, but mostly because of its size. Users need to make room for this router. It's ten inches wide, seven inches deep, and two inches tall, with three seven-inch antenna coming out the back. It easily takes up twice the surface area of most home routers.\n\nThe router also features a curved top, something anyone who tries to stack it amongst other networking equipment or home theater devices is going to be annoyed by. But this is a feature, not a bug. Wireless routers work best when left out in the open, meaning that stacking things on top of one is a bad idea if reception is important to you. And if it's not, why would you being buying a router?\n\nThe back of the EA7500 has five Gigabyte Ethernet ports. One is a WAN port for connecting to your modem, and the others are LAN ports for connecting other wired devices. There's also USB ports -- one USB 3.0, another USB 2.0 -- for plugging in external storage and sharing it over the network.\n\nRelated: Confused about Wi-Fi routers? Here's how to buy the right one for your home\n\nBut Ethernet and USB ports are not the reasons to buy this router -- Wi-Fi is. And the EA7500 does not disappoint on that front. The 802.11ac device offers 1.9Gbps speeds on two simultaneous bands, a 2.4GHz band offering up to 600Mbps and a 5GHz band offering up to 1300Mbps.\n\nThis isn't the highest bandwidth we've seen in a route. That distinction goes to the Nightgear Nighthawk X8, which offers 5.3Gbps of total Wi-Fi bandwidth across three channels. But that device is a staggering $400, twice as much as the EA7500.\n\nAfter setting up the EA7500, you will see two different Wi-Fi networks, one on the 2.4GHz channel, the other on 5GHz. The split spectrum requires that users strategize a bit. The 5GHz channel should be used for bandwidth-hungry devices, such as 4K streaming media boxes, that are near the router and will benefit from the 1300mps speed. This leaves the 2.4GHz channel, with its not-too-shabby 600Mbps, is freed up for day-to-day computing and web browsing.\n\nThis configuration, just one of many, means the connection on your phone or laptop isn't slowed when you're watching Netflix on your smart TV. Alternatively, if you're in a house with lots of rabid Wi-Fi users, you could simply switch from one network to the other when things slow down.\n\nThe Linksys EA7500 specifically directs its signals to connected devices using MU-MIMO, or beamforming. A normal router actually broadcasts its signal in every direction, which is effective, but results in poorer signal strength. MU-MIMO beams the signal towards the target device, instead. It's a solid feature that's still found only on routers near the upper end of the market.\n\nIf you've a bunch of devices simultaneously using a lot of bandwidth, this router should be able to handle it. Assuming every device is within range, your Internet connection speed is more likely to be the bottleneck for speed than your Wi-Fi signal. Most people lack a connection that can deliver anything close to 1.9Gbps, or even 600Mbps, the maximum speed of the 2.4GHz channel.\n\nThat's a lot of features and specifications, but will users notice the difference compared to their current routers? Based on my experience - yes!\n\nThere are many potential reasons for a spotty Wi-Fi connection, but at my place the problem is competition. I live in a narrow, three story townhouse, meaning most of my walls are shared with neighbors. Every 2.4GHz channel is congested somewhere in the house. It's a constant battle for spectrum and bandwidth.\n\nThe EA7500 gave me a huge edge in that fight. After setting up this router I couldn't find any place where a neighbors' network was stronger than my own, meaning the end of Wi-Fi dead spots. Latency in video calls and gaming stopped being an issue, and video streaming was also smooth. This was particularly true when I connected to the 5GHz network. Non of my neighbors are using this technology yet, meaning I've got that part of the wireless spectrum to myself.\n\nBut having a choice is also crucial here, because the 2.4GHz offers better range. Connected to this network, leaving my house didn't seem to be much of a problem. Even my back yard was covered. At one point I managed to (just barely) connect and send a Hangouts message from my mailbox, which is half a block away.\n\nRelated: What is MU-MIMO?\n\nObviously every location is different, and every house is going to present unique challenges for wireless connectivity. Some places have thick plaster walls, others have a cluttered wireless spectrum. But if your Wi-Fi connection is currently bad, upgrading to the Linksys EA7500 is likely to make a difference.\n\nMost users never bother to configure their router, in no small part because most routers are incomprehensible. Linksys is aware of this, and had done as much as possible to remove barriers.\n\nFirst, there's no IP address to memorize when you want to log in to the router. Instead, you can simply head to LinksysSmartWifi.com, or install the mobile app, to configure the device. Second, there's a number of widgets that quickly summarize the router's status, and let you configure things like guest access in just one click. Third, the page is designed in such a way that easily understood settings, like parental control, are prioritized.\n\nBut advanced options are still offered. You can set up your port forwarding and a custom DNS if you want to, and it's not hard to find if you know what you're doing. There's still advanced setting to play with, however, such as device priority, which can dedicate more bandwidth to hardware - like a TV box - that most needs it.\n\nParents will appreciate the parental control, which let you cut off the Internet on a schedule. Want your kid to go offline at PM? No problem.You can also block individuals sites, if you want to.\n\nOverall, it's a great router backend. It might not match the Google OnHub for ease of use, but it's a big improvement from most routers on the market.\n\nUnder ideal conditions, setting up the EA7500 is straight-forward. Connect the WAN port to your Internet connection, plug in the power cable, then connect to the network wirelessly using the information on the included card. Open up your browser and you'll be prompted to create a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account, and guided through the rest of the router's setup process.\n\nMy setup process wasn't so easy. The router couldn't connect to the Internet when I plugged it in, despite the fact that my laptop worked just fine using the same cable. This somehow prevented me from seeing the setup steps. I instead repeatedly saw a message stating that setup could not be completed, with instructions for a hard reset. Ultimately, I was only able to get the router working by first plugging it into my ISP's router.\n\nThis was frustrating, because I knew exactly what I needed to do -- set the EA7500 to assign itself a local IP address. There was seemingly no way to access that setting and enable Internet access before going through the setup process, and no obvious way to complete the setup process without Internet access. At one point I thought I'd found the answer, but was asked to enter a password I supposedly created during the very setup process I was trying to access.\n\nLinksys worked hard to ensure setting up the EA7500 was as simple as possible, which is ironically why it became so complicated for me. Earlier access to the advanced settings could have saved me some headaches, and I hope later versions of the firmware address this.\n\nThe Linksys EA7500 isn't the most powerful router on the market, or the easiest to use, or the most beautiful, but it ranks high in all three areas. The settings most novice users will want to tweak are easy to find, while the advanced settings aren't obscured. And despite the hiccups this reviewer had, it's easy to see how setup would be easy under most circumstances.\n\nFor $200 you could buy a similarly powerful Google OnHub router, which looks a lot nicer and is easier to configure, but you'd be limited to one Ethernet port and prevented from changing certain advanced settings. You could also splurge on something like the $400 Netgear Nighthawk X8, which offers twice as much potential bandwidth and sports an additional antenna. But that router costs $400, and the EA7500 already offers an excess of power at $200.\n\nFor many, the performance and features of any router aren't going to add up to $200. But if you're in the market for a high-end router, and don't have an infinite budget, the Linksys EA7500 is a good pick.", "SCOTTSBORO, Ala. -- The Jackson County Commission is taking the first steps to put a one cent sales tax increase proposal back on the table.\n\n\"We see revenues going down and decreasing, so we have to have a new source of revenue. We cut what we believe we can cut to keep managing the business,\" Jackson County Commission Chair Matthew Hodges says.\n\nHe says that's the reasoning behind why the commission is working toward a one cent sales tax increase proposal.\n\nFor years, the commission has been making cuts and changes to combat a near $2 million budget deficit. This most recent budget eliminated the deficit, but that came with hefty cuts across the board. Hodges says in order to move forward, there has to be a revenue source.\n\nJust last year Jackson County residents voted on a one cent sales tax increase but it was voted down. This time around Hodges says there will be different aspects to this measure. \"What we're requesting for this whole process is basically a tax that would go for a six year term,\" Hodges explains, \"So every six years, or at most every six years, it would come up for election.\"\n\nResidents could either continue the tax or not. Also, the commission is proposing to clearly earmark the funds on the ballot. Hodges says those two aspects were voiced as concerns last time around.\n\nLastly, if passed, the commission is proposing to make changes to the millage rate. \"We would either reduce our millage rate slightly or we would cut out the millage rate on our automobiles,\" Hodges says.\n\nThe commission has been looking at other alternatives. \"We want to be as open, and clear, and honest as possible, and really this is the best solution,\" Hodges says, \"There are some really complicated things we talked about out there but it wasn't going to work, and I don't think it could have been explained very well.\" Hodges says this proposal would garner the growing source of revenue the county needs. Also, he says it's easy to understand, which lends to the transparency the commission wants, unlike other options.\n\nHodges says other tax increase options that were mulled don't grow as much a one cent sales tax increase could. \"The commission really feels though, that the sales tax has the biggest impact on the future of this county because it does grow,\" Hodges says.\n\nCommissioners say another aspect to the sales tax increase is that the burden of that increase wouldn't be solely paid for by the county's residents. Visitors would contribute to that as well.\n\nDespite headline activity in Jackson County - like Google's recent announcement of a new data center, and TVA's even more recent announcement of discussions on the future of the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant -- county officials say they feel that this one cent sales tax increase proposal is the best avenue to move the county forward. \"With all of the things happening, we don't see where the county's financial situation is going to be solved by that,\" Hodges says.\n\nThe county won't receive property taxes for the Google data center project as a typical incentive.\n\nThe proposal has to go to the local legislative delegation in what would be one of the first steps in a long process. If approved and the necessary steps are taken, the proposal would head to Montgomery. If all of the necessary avenues are approved there, it would come back to Jackson County. Then the commission would pass a resolution to put on the ballot and designate earmarks. Then residents would vote on the tax increase proposal.\n\nHodges says the proposal is expected to go to the local legislative delegation this week.", "LOS ANGELES >> A self-driving car being tested by Google struck a public bus on a Silicon Valley street, a fender-bender that appears to be the first time one of the tech company's vehicles caused a crash during testing.\n\nGoogle accepted at least some responsibility for the collision, which occurred on Valentine's Day when one of the Lexus SUVs it has outfitted with sensors and cameras hit the side of the bus near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nNo one was injured, according to an accident report Google wrote and submitted to the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

Google's autonomous vehicles have been involved in a number of fender-bender accidents in recent years -- most of which have resulted in Google's cars being rear-ended -- but this may be the first time that it is the car's (and Google's) fault. In previous accidents, the party responsible for the crash was typically either another driver on the road or a test driver taking control of the self-driving car.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, a Google self-driving car, trying to avoid sandbags on a city street in Mountain View, struck a public bus. The accident was more of a fender bender than a full-blown collision -- the car was moving at 2 miles per hour and the city bus was moving at 15, and nobody was injured. In its report to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Google said the car's test driver assumed the bus would yield to the self-driving car, and when the accident happened, the test driver didn't have control.\n\nGoogle has been locked in a Silicon Valley arms race to develop self-driving cars for several years now. To that end, the tech behemoth, with its $484 billion market capitalization, has been testing a series of retrofitted Lexus S.U.V.s near its headquarters, and has faced a series of federal and state safety regulatory hurdles along the way. Right now, Google's cars are still very much in the testing phase, and the California D.M.V. is still working on regulations requiring self-driving cars to have a steering wheel and a licensed driver as a back-up plan, in case something happens. Google, however, thinks these requirements would actually make the cars less safe by enabling passengers to go rogue and override the autonomous system's decisions.\n\nRegulatory issues aside, Google is up against fierce competition in the self-driving-car space. Uber is heavily investing in its self-driving research facility in Pittsburgh, and C.E.O. Travis Kalanick hasn't been shy about his ambitions to replace his company's drivers with autonomous vehicles. Lyft is working with G.M. to develop self-driving cars, too. Tesla and Apple are also both working on their own fleets of semi- or fully autonomous vehicles. But, like a teenager in driving school, the self-driving-car industry is still young. A few bumps are to be expected along the way.", "Google has expressed interest in virtual reality in the past and launched devices like the Cardboard. However there are rumors that Google has plans to launch a more dedicated virtual reality headset, like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and the PlayStation VR, which is why it doesn't come as a surprise to learn that the company has since launched a dedicated VR page for its store.\n\nIf you're looking to pick up some virtual reality offerings from Google, the company has created a section on its store that is dedicated to its virtual reality content. This is where users can buy existing hardware like the basic Google Cardboard, the Mattel View-Master, or the Goggle Tech C1-Glass, which are priced at $15, $30, and $15 respectively.\n\nThese are somewhat limited choices, but we can only assume that a dedicated storefront means that Google plans on growing it sometime in the future. In addition to the devices, Google is also promoting other aspects of virtual reality such as apps that you can take advantage of, and handsets that will be compatible with said headsets, like the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P.\n\nIn any case if you are interested in picking up a Google Cardboard, or at least something similar, then pop on over to the Google Store for the details.", "Tamer Rafla Founder & CEO of Klujo. Start-up mentor. Husband and Dad of 2\n\nWe've all come across technology stories with the headline usually reading something like Ex-Google engineers want to be [insert name of any hot startup] for [insert emerging market]. The stories are unusually similar and the focus is on young people who got bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. Their personal challenges might revolve around not having enough energy drinks or ramen noodles as they pull all-nighters, just like they did in college just a few years or even months back. Why don't we hear much about seasoned professionals who are putting their young family's financial freedom at risk for the uncertainty of starting a business?\n\nThirteen months ago, I decided to let go of a rewarding career as a management consultant for Fortune 500 companies to launch a tech startup. With a mortgage slowly eating up my savings, time wasn't on my side. I put my consultant hat back on and adopted a lean approach to minimize the impact on my family. Follow these 4 tips to remain sane while you navigate through the personal ups and downs of launching an online business.\n\nTip #1 - Use your time efficiently\n\nThe hardest challenge kids create when starting a new company is that you no longer have complete control of your time. It's no longer possible to work whenever you want, wherever you want and for as long as you want. Kids have schedules too - they wake up at certain times, they need to be fed, played with, picked up, dropped off, and all kinds of other needs that have to be attended to. While you can control some of these, you can't control them all.\n\nWith the addition of those elements to your daily work routine, you need to become extremely efficient at managing your time and ruthless about wasting time while at work. You may have to answer emails as the kids are being fed or even brainstorm a project while you are bathing them. And if you know you can only be working from 9-4 during the day, you just can't spend an hour on Facebook or going to a long lunch with an old friend.\n\nAdvice: Make an efficient use of your time and create a schedule you can easily stick to. Remain ruthless about maximizing your work time, and add some extra work time either early in the morning or late at night when the kids are asleep.\n\nTip #2 - Let go of the things that can hold you back\n\nA proven way to be more efficient at work is to let go of the things that can hold you back. We all enjoy relaxing doing different things, with some of them taking up a significant amount of time. Examples of this could be watching movies, reading books, being on Facebook, and spending time with friends.\n\nFortunately, some of these things can easily be cut out of your daily routine or used in a sensible fashion. The reality is that spending time with your kids and spouse should take priority over any of those of activities. I wouldn't recommend that you completely cut all enjoyable activities out of your life because that could end up making you hate your work and feeling depressed. Besides, there can be value in recharging and letting your mind brainstorm while idle.\n\nAdvice: Start by keeping track of how much time you spend doing these kinds of activities. Find the ones that you can go without for a prolonged period of time and that doesn't affect your mood. Once you've identified those \"non-value added\" items, try cutting them out of your daily routine and monitor results. Keep iterating with this list activities until you've reached your ultimate level of productivity and started noticing results.\n\nTip #3- Set Manageable Expectations\n\nThe situation that you really want to avoid is for either your family or your team to have unrealistic expectations of you.\n\nIt can be detrimental to a relationship when starting company without the spouse's blessing and support of the time commitment, potentially low pay, high stress, and frequent travel that such a venture would entail. Both parties need to understand the implications and the sacrifices that each will make in order to bring to fruition this new project.\n\nSome of your employees could be single and be possible for them to work 18 hours straight. Unfortunately, they need to realize that this is not going to be possible for you. You really need to make sure they understand how much time you'll be able to give them on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nAdvice: Talk candidly with your family and your team about your expected schedule and commitments so that there are no surprises. It is key for everyone to go into this adventure with eyes wide open. Make sure your schedule is communicated beforehand and your employees encouraged to take a leading role in their work. You will be bothered less and will help you get more things done.\n\nTip #4 - Build a Support Network\n\nYou can't manage everything yourself and your spouse can't either. It's perfectly fine to seek help by building a personal support network that can be called upon when the need arises. To tap into this powerful system, you might have to move close to family for them to help with the kids, and give you and your spouse a break. Really close friends with kids the same age as yours could also serve as an option.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, there also can be support network options such as hiring cheaper contracted help for certain tasks that take up a lot of time like administrative work, accounting, and other things that aren't necessarily core to your company's success.\n\nAdvice: Hopefully you have some available friends and family that might be free. If not, it may cost money but finding help either at home or the office can help with a lot of the time strain that can occur with kids.", "Google pledged $2 million to Bay Area groups working to eliminate racial disparities in education, and another $1 million to a national racial-justice group.

Just before the accident, the car was driving in the right lane toward an intersection and had signaled for a right turn. Sandbags surrounding a storm drain caused the vehicle to move left into the center of the wide lane.\n\n\"A public transit bus was approaching from behind. The Google AV test driver saw the bus approaching in the left side mirror, but believed the bus would stop or slow to allow the Google AV to continue,\" the accident report said. \"Approximately three seconds later, as the Google AV was reentering the center of the lane, it made contact with the side of the bus.\"\n\nWhile no injuries were reported, the Google AV sustained body damage to the left front fender, the left front wheel and one of its driver's-side doors, the accident report stated.\n\nIn a reply to Computerworld questions, Google said its fleet of AVs spend a lot of time on El Camino Real, a boulevard that has \"hundreds of sets of traffic lights and hundreds more intersections.\"\n\nAlong with an in-house vehicle that has no steering wheel, Google has 23 Lexus RX450h SUVs performing test drives on California public roads. To date, the vehicles have logged more than 1 million miles, according to Google.\n\nThe company said testing on El Camino Real has helped it learn to navigate \"a busy and historic artery,\" but \"on Valentine's Day we ran into a tricky set of circumstances on El Camino....\"\n\nMost of the time Google's AVs drive in the middle of a lane but \"when you're teeing up a right-hand turn in a lane wide enough to handle two streams of traffic, annoyed traffic stacks up behind you.\n\n\"So several weeks ago we began giving the self-driving car the capabilities it needs to do what human drivers do: hug the rightmost side of the lane.

After waiting for some other vehicles to pass, the car -- still in autonomous mode -- began angling back toward the center of the lane at about 2 mph. That's when it crashed into the side of the bus.\n\n\"Our car had detected the approaching bus, but predicted that it would yield to us because we were ahead of it,\" Google said.\n\nThe test driver, who had been watching the bus in the mirror, also expected the bus to slow or stop, Google said, \"and we can imagine the bus driver assumed we were going to stay put.\n\n\"Unfortunately, all these assumptions led us to the same spot in the lane at the same time. This type of misunderstanding happens between human drivers on the road every day,\" Google said.\n\nThis is the first time Google has acknowledged some responsibility for an accident involving one of its autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe accident, Google said, is a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving: \"We're all trying to predict each other's movements.\n\n\"In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision. That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that,\" the company added.\n\nGoogle said it has reviewed this incident, as well as thousands of variations on it, in a driving simulator and made refinements to its AV software.\n\n\"From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future,\" Google said.\n\nFollow Us TwitterLinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

This is a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving -- we're all trying to predict each other's movements,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nThe company said the Google test driver who was behind the wheel thought the bus was going to yield, and the bus driver likely thought the Google car was going to yield to the bus.\n\n\"In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision,\" Google said.\n\nGoogle said its car was traveling less than 2 mph, the bus about 15 mph. Its car sustained some damage to the left side; it did not report what damage the bus sustained.\n\nGoogle said it has accumulated more than 1 million miles of autonomous driving, and said it has made changes to its software to try to avoid future accidents like this.\n\nRelated: Feds to Google - Cars don't need drivers\n\n\"From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future,\" said the company.", "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A self-driving car being tested by Google struck a public bus on a Silicon Valley street, a fender-bender that appears to be the first time one of the tech company's vehicles caused a crash during testing.\n\nGoogle accepted at least some responsibility for the collision, which occurred on Valentine's Day when one of the Lexus SUVs it has outfitted with sensors and cameras hit the side of the bus near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nNo one was injured, according to an accident report Google wrote and submitted to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. It was posted online Monday.\n\nAccording to the report, Google's car intended to turn right off a major boulevard when it detected sandbags around a storm drain at the intersection.\n\nThe right lane was wide enough to let some cars turn and others go straight, but the Lexus needed to slide to its left within the right lane to get around the obstruction.\n\nThe Lexus was going 2 mph when it made the move and its left front struck the right side of the bus, which was going straight at 15 mph.\n\nThe car's test driver -- who under state law must be in the front seat to grab the wheel when needed -- thought the bus would yield and did not have control before the collision, Google said.\n\nWhile the report does not address fault, Google said in a written statement, \"We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision.\"\n\nChris Urmson, the head of Google's self-driving car project, said in a brief interview that he believes the Lexus was moving before the bus started to pass.\n\n\"We saw the bus, we tracked the bus, we thought the bus was going to slow down, we started to pull out, there was some momentum involved,\" Urmson told The Associated Press.\n\nHe acknowledged that Google's car did have some responsibility but said it was \"not black and white.\"\n\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority said none of the 15 passengers or the driver of the bus was injured.\n\nAn internal investigation by the transit agency was ongoing and \"no determination of liability has been made,\" spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said in a written statement.\n\nThere may never be a legal decision on liability, especially if damage was negligible -- as both sides indicated it was -- and neither Google nor the transit authority pushes the case.\n\nStill, the collision could be the first time a Google car in autonomous mode caused a crash.\n\nGoogle cars have been involved in nearly a dozen collisions in or around Mountain View since starting to test on city streets in the spring of 2014. In most cases, Google's cars were rear-ended. No one has been seriously injured.\n\nGoogle's written statement called the Feb. 14 collision \"a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving -- we're all trying to predict each other's movements.\"\n\nGoogle said its computers have reviewed the incident and engineers changed the software that governs the cars to understand that buses may not be as inclined to yield as other vehicles.\n\nA spokeswoman for California's DMV, which regulates Google's testing of about two dozen Lexus SUVs in the state, said the agency hoped to speak Monday with Google. Under state law, Google must retain data from the moments before and after any collision.\n\n\"As far as he-said she-said, there shouldn't be any of that. It's all there,\" said Robert W. Peterson, an insurance law expert at Santa Clara University who has studied self-driving cars.\n\nA critic of Google's self-driving car efforts said the collision shows the tech giant should be kept from taking onto public streets self-driving prototypes it built without a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nGoogle sees that as the next natural step for the technology, and has pressed California's DMV and federal regulators to authorize cars in which humans have limited means of intervening.\n\n\"Clearly Google's robot cars can't reliably cope with everyday driving situations,\" said John M. Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog. \"There needs to be a licensed driver who can takeover, even if in this case the test driver failed to step in as he should have.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story had been corrected to show that Google began testing on city streets in 2014, not 2015.", "Stocks started the week with losses and finished February mixed.

Although the search giant has had six years of experience under their belt with only 17 minor accidents occurring across over two million miles of test driving, this month marks the first time that a self-driving vehicle bore any culpability in a traffic incident.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, February 14, 2016, a self-driving Lexus RX450h attempted to navigate around some sandbags placed in a wide lane. A bus traveling at 15 mph approached the Google car from behind, occupying same wide lane as the smart car. The Lexus attempted to re-enter the center of the lane while moving at a speed of 2 mph.\n\nGoogle reported in a statement last week that the smart car anticipated that the bus would slow down to allow the self driving car to continue, but the bus did not. When the smart car re-entered the center of the lane, it struck the side of the bus causing minor damage to the front left fender, front wheel, and a sensor. There were no injuries, and no police report was filed.\n\nIn spite of the lack of police involvement, which usually determines culpability, Google says they are at least partially responsible for the incident. Their traffic algorithms take into account the common practice of vehicles slowing down to accommodate the merging of others. It would appear that buses and similar large vehicles are less likely to slow down in these situations, and Google says they are making adjustments based on this and \"thousands of variations on it in our simulator,\" to make their vehicles \"more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles.\"\n\nGoogle is taking a stance that this is all a part of the learning process, but even extremely small incidents like this can be damaging to the development of self driving cars. Although many futurists believe that this revolution is inevitable, public fear and concerns that feed on smart-car culpable accidents may seriously delay this technology becoming mainstream.", "But there's reason for hope\n\nHP recently announced that it's getting back in the smartphone business with the Elite x3, a 5.9-inch Windows handset with a Qualcomm 820 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.\n\nBut what makes the Elite really interesting is that, thanks to a special dock, the device can power a laptop or even desktop PC experience. Special software from HP provides access to Windows desktop apps users know and love.\n\nUsing a smartphone as the brains of a PC experience isn't a new concept -- Motorola tried and failed back in 2011. I've seen a handful of other company's aborted attempts, too. But whether or not HP's efforts succeed, the Elite raises a larger question about today's smartphones.\n\nThanks to quickly improving mobile processors, smartphone makers are cramming ever more functionality into their handheld devices. As a result, they're capable of getting more done -- but in many cases they're also becoming harder to use.\n\nPart of the problem is that smartphone makers think everyone wants to use their phones for \"productivity.\" This may be true from some, but most smartphone owners aren't looking to their devices to get stuff done. Designing for productivity, however, necessarily adds more complexity to the overall smartphone experience.\n\nWe polled thousands of customers and found that about 80% of all smartphone users only use 8-12 apps on a consistent basis, typically for tasks like email, messaging, social networking, news, games, weather and photography. But only about 10-15% of users said they also use smartphones for serious productivity.\n\nTo put this in context, about 2.5 billion smartphones will be sold worldwide this year, with most consumers only using them for basic communication. Yet smartphone software keeps getting more powerful and complex so the needs of the power users can be met. The result is overly complex smartphones that are more difficult for users who don't need the added features.\n\nI understand that some consumers want maximum power to run any and all apps and services on their smartphones. But on the other hand, modern smartphones are often confusing. And many apps have interfaces of their own to learn, making the overall experience still more complex.\n\nMobile software companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft are aware of this issue, and they're taking steps to remedy it. Voice assistants like Siri and Google Now help streamline the user experience, as do other emerging features that try to serve up the apps and information a user might want at a given time or location before they even request it.\n\nThese are all reasons to believe that there's a roadmap in place to simplify smartphones in the future. With any luck, we'll have these features in devices arriving as early as this year.\n\nTim Bajarin is recognized as one of the leading industry consultants, analysts and futurists, covering the field of personal computers and consumer technology.

The battle burst into public after a California judge this month ordered the company to aid prosecutors seeking access a terrorist's phone, but by then Apple had spent months in a Brooklyn court fighting over the drug dealer's device.\n\nOn Monday, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein said the government's demands on Apple are impractical and excessive.\n\n\"It would be absurd to posit that the authority the government sought was anything other than obnoxious to the law,\" he said in a 50-page opinion.\n\nAfter helping prosecutors unlock at least 70 iPhones, Apple last year stopped cooperating and said the company would no longer serve as the government's helper. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said this month that U.S. demands for iPhone access are a chilling attack on privacy. The government says Apple is more concerned about its marketing and brand identity than about the safety of the public.\n\nEmbolden Apple\n\nMonday's decision is certain to embolden Apple, which has fought its case in the courts of law and public opinion. At a minimum, it offers the Cupertino, California-based company a legal basis for defying the government. Should the issue reach the Supreme Court, as is likely with the California case, Orenstein's opinion may inform the high court's decision. Congress has scheduled hearings on the matter.\n\nWith Apple and other companies building even more robust encryption, the eventual outcome of the Brooklyn and California cases could have lasting impact on personal privacy, national security, law enforcement and the technology industry. Orenstein is the first judge to thoroughly explore what the government can and cannot access. Prosecutors across the country, some stymied in their own investigations by locked iPhones, are watching the cases.\n\nThe company didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision.\n\nNine Cases\n\nThe Brooklyn case is one of at least dozen across the country in which Apple has refused to help investigators access an iPhone. The ruling will almost certainly be appealed by prosecutors. Apple is fighting the California order, which is not yet final.\n\nProsecutors in Brooklyn are seeking help accessing an older operating system, iOS 7, by bypassing the user's passcode and downloading the data.\n\nThe phone in California uses a newer operating system, with tighter encryption standards that make it virtually impossible to access content of a phone without a pass code. U.S. investigators can still attempt to get the data through a \"brute force\" tactic of entering unlimited pass code numbers, but extra protections may erase all data on a phone if the wrong code is entered more than 10 times.\n\nThe government wants Apple to disable that feature in a single iPhone. Apple said in a Feb. 25 legal brief in California that the U.S. demand is a \"dangerous\" one that would force the company to create an entirely new operating system with a \"back door\" open to \"hackers, identity thieves, hostile foreign agents and unwarranted government surveillance.\"\n\nFundamental Dispute\n\nMonths before the San Bernardino attack, both Apple and the government recognized that the legal dispute was so fundamental that they pressed Orenstein for a ruling even though the defendant in the crystal meth conspiracy case had pleaded guilty. The legal principles courts establish may be controlling regardless of a phone's degree of encryption.\n\nSince Cook published a Feb. 16 letter declaring that Apple would challenge the magistrate's order, law enforcement officials across the country have rallied behind the Justice Department.\n\nJonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association, said in a phone interview he was \"disappointed\" by Apple's stand, which he said puts \"profit over safety.\"\n\n\"This has nothing to do with privacy,\" Thompson said. \"It's all about money and their brand.\"\n\nCalifornia Case\n\nThe Brooklyn decision will have no direct bearing on the California case, where Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym issued a ruling even before giving Apple an opportunity to weigh in. The company has now filed its legal briefs, and Pym will consider the case further and may consider Orenstein's decision even if not bound by it.\n\nStill, Orenstein's ruling adds fuel to what is becoming a feverish public debate. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has called for a boycott of Apple over its refusal to cooperate with law enforcement.\n\nBig names in the tech sector came to Apple's defense after the California order. Microsoft Corp. said it would file a legal brief in support of Apple. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the government's request could spur \"a troubling precedent.\" WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said on his Facebook page, \"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\"\n\nThe case is Order requiring Apple, Inc. to assist in the execution of a search warrant issued by the court et al, 1:15-mc-1902, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).\n\nRead this next: Apple vs. the FBI: the Complete Guide Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "Google is getting a wee more enterprisey.

In other words, neither the blog post announcing the news nor the website that promotes it contains pricing information.\n\nUntil this point Chrome support was only available to Apps customers, Google for Work product manager Saswat Panigrahi wrote in the blog post. Initially Chrome for Work Assist is only available in the U.S. and Canada, but it will become more widely available in the future, he wrote. In addition to providing support, Google will be helping companies deploy Chrome across their workforce in the new offering, Panigrahi wrote.\n\nChrome has racked up more than 1 billion active users.

Sewell will argue that following the order would also create a \"dangerous legal precedent\" that the FBI and law enforcement agencies would use to pressure courts to unlock other encrypted devices.\n\n[READ: FBI's Case Against Apple and Friction Between Security and Modifiability]\n\n\"We feel strongly that our customers, their families, their friends and their neighbors will be better protected from thieves and terrorists if we can offer the very best protections for their data,\" Sewell's prepared remarks state. \"And at the same time, the freedoms and liberties we all cherish will be more secure.\"\n\nThe FBI argues that it needs Apple to unlock the iPhone 5c of Syed Rizwan Farook, who was fatally shot by authorities along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, after they killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December. Sewell's prepared remarks reiterate comments recently made by Apple CEO Tim Cook that the company obeyed other warrants for information during the San Bernardino investigation, and that the court order is requesting data encrypted by the phone, which the company does not have access to.\n\nFBI Director James Comey will also testify during the hearing. Comey has been a staunch critic of the use of the privacy software since Apple and Google first announced in 2014 their plans to encrypt smartphones so that the company cannot remotely access data that is stored on those devices. The director told the House Intelligence Committee last week that the privacy debate over encryption is \"the hardest question I have seen in government.\"\n\nTo address the broader controversy about privacy and digital security, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia want to form a commission of 16 experts from various fields to propose solutions on such issues as encryption. The lawmakers introduced a bill on Monday seeking to create that commission.\n\n[ALSO: Warner, McCaul to Discuss Encryption Commission Plan]\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has said any encryption commission Congress creates should make proposals within 90 days, instead of the six months or a year it could take for the group of experts to complete its work.

PG&E's gas distribution record-keeping violations endanger the public.\"\n\nThe safety unit, in a Feb. 26 filing, wants PG&E shareholders to finance a fine of $111.9 million and is asking the PUC to order the utility to undertake several record-keeping remedies.\n\nThe new PUC filings, along with other proceeding such as a criminal trial connected to the San Bruno explosion that is due to begin in a few weeks, are a reminder that numerous issues brought to light by the San Bruno blast remain front and center.\n\n\"PG&E insists that it did not break the law, despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary,\" Carmel stated in its filing with the PUC. \"The utility's denials show that PG&E prefers to waste limited resources instead of facing responsibility for its actions.\"\n\nCarmel, in a Feb. 26 filing, urged the PUC to impose a fine for all the record-keeping violations being reviewed in the proceeding. The proposed $651.8 million would include a $136.6 million fine for the flawed records connected to the Carmel blast.\n\nThe San Bruno explosion, federal investigators have determined, was caused by a combination of PG&E's flawed record-keeping and shoddy maintenance, and the PUC's lazy supervision of the utility.\n\n\"PG&E disagrees with the Safety and Enforcement Division's and the City of Carmel's conclusions, which we believe misinterpret applicable regulations and the record in this proceeding, and fail to acknowledge the significant improvements PG&E has made to its distribution records,\" said Gregory Snapper, PG&E spokesman.\n\nA PUC law judge would have to issue a recommendation, which would then receive a final decision from the PUC, on whether to levy fresh penalties on PG&E.\n\nBesides the Carmel explosion, the proceeding is looking at alleged violations in connection with incidents in Mountain View, Castro Valley, Morgan Hill, Milpitas, San Ramon, Antioch, Alameda, Kentfield, Alamo, Lafayette, San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno, Colusa, Sacramento and Roseville.\n\nWhat's more, the PUC is also investigating missing gas leak repair records from its De Anza division, which serves 420,000 residents in western Santa Clara County. The unit includes the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Saratoga, and Sunnyvale. Among the well-known corporate or government customers of the division: Apple, Google, Lockheed Martin and the NASA Ames complex.\n\nThe De Anza division is missing records from 1979 through 1991, according to the Safety Enforcement Division filing.\n\nSan Francisco-based PG&E said it has undertaken numerous initiatives since the San Bruno explosion in September 2010 to improve its gas operations. Among them, the utility has: digitized more than 12 million pages of gas system records in recent years; deployed digital mapping and analytics tools for its gas distribution system; and empowered employees to stop work on projects if the gas system records don't match what is observed in the field.\n\n\"We've made extensive progress,\" Snapper said. \"We have more work to do.\""]}, "Allianz": {"2016-02-26": ["\"The richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population.\"\n\nSanders relied on a 2014 analysis from Oxfam, which came up with the comparison from two different reports.\n\nThe first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes' list of billionaires.\n\nWe'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats.\n\nAnalysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $263 trillion. From there, analysts estimated that the bottom half of the world's population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world's population own .72 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.7 trillion.\n\nJames Davies, one of the report's lead authors and an economist at the University of Western Ontario, said no one else has done this exact study. That's true, but the Allianz Group, another global financial corporation, and the Boston Consulting Group, a financial and management consulting firm, have estimates of total household financial wealth that are pretty close to what Credit Suisse reported.\n\nBrent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, told us both his firm and Credit Suisse used much of the same data, but Credit Suisse included more countries. Beardsley said that difference wouldn't be significant.\n\nThe strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, Beardsley said.\n\n\"(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,\" Beardsley said. \"In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty.\"\n\nThe second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward.\n\nOxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.7 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population.\n\nForbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off because far from all the necessary information is public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market.\n\nThe list can't deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world's wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate.\n\nOne final note: The divide between the super rich and the bottom of the global population appears to be getting worse.\n\nCredit Suisse, Forbes and Oxfam update their numbers at least every year and for 2015, Oxfam said just 62 billionaires own as much as half the world's people combined.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, however, told us the video was shot before the latest Oxfam report.

The BDI has close ties to its Confederation of British Industry, which likewise rejects an exit from the EU.\n\nA vote to leave in the June 23 referendum would spark a \"tooth-and-nail fight\" between the U.K. and its erstwhile partners to secure bilateral advantages in the separation, Kerber said in an interview in Berlin Thursday.\n\n\"It wouldn't be an amicable divorce,\" Kerber said. And, unlike for Norway and Switzerland, \"there's no default European free-trade status in the waiting.\"\n\nKerber's comments underscore the increasing unease felt in Germany over the business fallout of an exit.

It is a lie,\" said Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States since 2013.\n\n\"Terrorism is driven not by poverty or hopelessness,\" Dermer said. \"Terrorism is actually driven by a fervent sense of hope, a hope that these fanatics will be able to achieve their fanatical goal - and what creates that fanaticism is a totalitarian mindset.\"\n\nThe glorification of killers in some societies produces more terrorist candidates in younger generations, Dermer told the audience of NRB member organization leaders and guests.\n\n\"Until we deal with the poison that you see throughout the Middle East that is poisoning the minds and hearts of a generation of young people, you're not going to have peace,\" the ambassador said.\n\nDermer told the Christian leaders his country \"needs your support today more than ever because the Middle East is collapsing.

In addition, Christians \"are being wiped out\" in that region, he said.\n\nThe world's \"most important challenge\" in addressing militant Islam is \"to prevent these fanatics from having nuclear weapons,\" Dermer said. \"Everything must be done to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of these fanatics.\"\n\nIsrael opposed the nuclear deal negotiated by America and other major powers with Iran, a committed foe of Israel, because it \"didn't think [the agreement] blocked a path to the bomb.

Simple: Anyone can be broken, given the right cocktail of bribery and coercion, and that was probably never truer than in the young USSR. Spooky Action Theater explores the thin line between power and corruption in Soviet Russia with their latest production of John Hodge's Olivier Award-winning play Collaborators.\n\nThe play begins with a dream: Joseph Stalin (Joe Duquette), laughing maniacally, chases a man and threatens to kill to him with a typewriter. This heavy-handed bit of symbolism becomes more interesting when we learn the man in question is author Mikhail Bulgakov (Paul Reisman), best known for his satirical novel The Master and Margarita. In 1938 Moscow, Bulgakov and his intellectual circle are constantly persecuted by Stalin's secret police, personified by Vladimir (G. Michael Harris) and Stepan (Sha Golanski). Stalin's thugs pay Bulgakov and his wife Yelena (MacKenzie Beyer) a visit to make the author an offer he should not refuse: If he writes a propaganda play in honor of Stalin's 60th birthday, his new play Moli\u00e8re can be performed again. While Bulgakov initially sets out, begrudgingly, to write the play alone, eventually he receives help from an unlikely collaborator (get it?) -- Stalin himself. While Stalin helps with the play, he asks for Bulgakov's help with running the Motherland, asking the playwright to forge his signature on political orders. Cue a Dostoyevsky-esque moral struggle.\n\nWhile some members of the cast were apparently under the weather -- coughs could be heard both onstage and off -- the acting in Collaborators is uniformly solid. Reisman and Duquette have great chemistry as the author and the dictator, respectively. Duquette in particular has a natural, commanding presence on stage which lends itself to portraying the Russian despot. Beyer's performance as Bulgakov's wife is similarly weightless, even while navigating the heavier moments that come with struggles under a totalitarian government. Beyer and Reisman together portray a palpable love, which will send you to Wikipedia wondering about the real Mr. and Mrs. Bulgakov. The ensemble, too, has some great comedic moments, particularly from Kim Curtis as the Bulgakov's fallen bourgeois roommate Vasilly, as well as from Willem Krumich and Matthew Marcus who are hilarious in scenes from the imaginary propaganda play Young Joseph.\n\nThe scenery, from set designer Giorgos Tsappas and scenic artist Mariana Fernandez, takes a geometric aesthetic reminiscent of silent film classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The set is deceptively simple; a set of pocket doors alternatively serve as kitchen cupboard and the dream realm of Stalin. With its heavy wooden doors and stone walls, Spooky Action's space -- the Universalist National Memorial Church -- already gives the audience that Russian chill before they even get inside, while the design elements on the set transport the audience to an expressionist version of 1938 Moscow. But despite Director Richard Henrich's smooth transitions and the largely good acting, the performance still feels longer than the two-and-a-half hour runtime. Perhaps it's the Russian setting -- lengthiness is somewhat expected from a Russian story -- but it seems more likely that John Hodge's scenes repeating themselves are the culprit.\n\nSpooky Action turns in a fine production with Collaborators. While the play will certainly resonate more with audiences familiar with Russian history and the work of Bulgakov, our upcoming election should provide some meaningful parallels -- did someone say something about the banality of evil and the depressing futility of fighting corruption? While those parallels will not send you from the theater laughing, Collaborators will give you plenty of moments for contemplation.", "published:\n\n26.02.2016, 19:49\n\nupdated:\n\n26.02.2016 19:59\n\nPrague - Painter Helga Hoskova-Weissova and actress Marie Tomasova were given the title of Dame od Czech Culture and artist Jiri Sozansky and actor Frantisek Miska the title of Knight of Czech Culture at the Mene Tekel international project against totalitarianism today.\n\nMinistr kultury Daniel Herman (vpravo) p\u0159edal 26. \u00fanora v Praze v r\u00e1mci festivalu Mene Tekel ocen\u011bn\u00ed D\u00e1ma \u010desk\u00e9 kultury here\u010dce Marii Tom\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e9. \u010cTK Krumphanzl Michal\n\nFotogalerie: Ryt\u00ed\u0159 a D\u00e1ma \u010desk\u00e9 kultury\n\nThe decoration was also given to singer and actor Karel Hasler and writer Bozena Kuklova-Jisova in memoriam.\n\nAll the decorated personalities opposed totalitarian regimes or they were persecuted by these regimes.\n\nCulture Minister Daniel Herman also passed the honorary title of Czech Culture Patron to Meda Mladkova, founder of the Museum Kampa in Prague.\n\nHerman said he wanted to point to personalities whose art but also moral qualities were inspiring.\n\nThe annual decorations were given for the second time this year.\n\nThe painter Hoskova-Weissova (1929) focuses on the topic of the Holocaust, being a Holocaust survivor herself.

While the primary goal of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health is to integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community, it goes much further by recommending comprehensive mental-health screening for \"consumers of all ages,\" including preschool children.\n\nIn its final report, \"Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America,\" the Commission sets out several nationwide initiatives, including utilizing electronic medical records for mental health screening. The report includes the following national goals and recommendations:\n\nGoal #4 - Early mental health screening, assessment, and referral to services are [to become] common practice.\n\nThe report states, \"In a transformed mental health system, the early detection of mental health problems in children and adults -- through routine and comprehensive testing and screening -- will be an expected and typical occurrence....Quality screening and early intervention will occur in...readily accessible, low-stigma settings, such as primary health care facilities and schools....Both children and adults will be screened for mental illnesses during their routine physical exams. For consumers of all ages, early detection, assessment, and links with treatment and supports will help prevent mental health problems from worsening....To aid in transforming the mental health system, the Commission makes four recommendations:\n\nAnother goal and recommendation is to establish electronic medical records for mental-health purposes, as indicated by the Commission's sixth goal:\n\nGoal #6 - Technology [will be] used to access mental health care and information.\n\nThe Committee's recommendations for this goal include:\n\nPresident Bush has already instructed more than 25 federal agencies to develop an implementation plan based on the Commission's recommendations, the BMJ reports.\n\nIn an article responding to the national mental-health initiative, the July 12 issue of the \"pro-capitalist\" New Americannotes, \"In totalitarian societies such as Soviet Russia and Communist Cuba, the state pathologizes dissent as a mental disorder. Mr. Bush's proposal, in principle, would permit the same horrific abuses by putting Washington in charge of screening all school children -- and, eventually, all other Americans.\"\n\nThe \"anti-capitalist\" New Standard reported on June 27 that \"The American Psychiatric Association, which itself receives some funding from drug companies, has hailed the Commission's conclusions as a sound preventative approach to dealing with mental illness.\" The article continues, \"Critics of the plan, however, point to strong connections between the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health and the pharmaceutical industry, and they contend that the plan will be a financial boon to drug companies while compromising the mental health of the nation's children.\"\n\nAccording to a July 19 Illinois Leader article, Illinois has already passed a $10 million mental-health screening plan, the \"Children's Mental Health Act of 2003.\" The article notes, \"The mental health program will develop a mental health system for 'all children ages 0-18 years' [and] provide for screening to 'ensure appropriate and culturally relevant assessment of young children's social and emotional development with the use of standardized tools.' Also, all pregnant women will be screened for depression and thereafter following her baby's birth, up to one year. Follow-up treatment services will also be provided.\" The article points out that the bill had support from both major political parties. But when some parents found out about it, they raised alarm and are now asking other parents and concerned citizens to voice their opinions at public forums throughout the state.\n\nAn important issue worth considering regarding national mental-health screening is who will monitor and evaluate the \"experts\"? If history is any indication, much of so-called mental illness is subjective and differs greatly across cultural, religious, and political lines. For example, in 1967 homosexuals were considered to be \"afflicted with [a] psychopathic personality\" and were prevented from immigrating to the United States (see the U.S. Supreme Court case Boutilier v. Immigration Service).\n\nLarge special-interest groups -- many of them well-meaning -- are pushing for state-based and national screening for a variety of illnesses, not just mental illnesses. If you are concerned about your and your families' freedom from compulsory screening, diagnoses, and treatment, you should contact your state and federal policymakers and voice your own opinion on the matter.\n\nThe president's report can be accessed online atwww.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/FinalReport/FullReport.htm.\n\nThis article was originally published in the July/August 2004 issue of Health Freedom Watch.", "I do not mean to offend anyone personally.

To ask why we are here, for what purpose we were born, how we came to be and if we are alone: that is such a fantastic thing to be able to do that I sometimes become disappointed with the idea of faith which seems to me not to encourage that kind of questioning. Instead it tells us: this is how it is, this is how it always will be, there is no need to question, and that's the end of it!\n\nI think that deprives people. I think that is such a denigrating, unbecoming view of the universe and I think it's tragic that children are brought up with that way of thinking when they could have been brought up in a more open-minded way.\n\nI do think religious faith, unsupported by evidence, can be a powerful psychological weapon. It doesn't have to be, of course, but it can very easily be. It is a weapon because the unscrupulous of our kind can and have used it to create a hold on others and use them as weapons, as human bombs and soldiers. The only reason they could be deployed as human bombs is that they have been brought up from childhood onwards to believe, unreservedly and without question, whatever the particular religion is, that the will of God is being fulfilled when they detonate themselves and blow up a busload of people or blow up a skyscraper in New York. I don't think a rational person could do so otherwise.\n\nAt the very least we must stop the indoctrination of the idea that there is something virtuous in blind belief. There is virtue in morality, and many might disagree with me on this, but morality does not derive itself from religion. Very truly it precedes it. I'm very concerned how children coming into the world, naive and knowing close to nothing about it, are taken over by the religion of wherever they happen to be born.\n\nWhen a child is clearly too young to question what they think about creationism and transubstantiation, it's very unlikely that they will. But even if they do, they are told not to, and that doing so will earn them God's wrath, or that there is a puppeteer of sorts sitting on a cloud somewhere who watches us, and can convict us of thought crime (the very definition of totalitarianism), and has made this special place, just for us, where he will burn and torture us for all eternity simply for the crime of being born, unless we throw ourselves at his mercy and cower before him -- but he loves us. There's something sick, I think, in being commanded to love someone you're simultaneously supposed to fear.\n\nMy arguments involve the example of children because I believe that religion and faith were developed and invented at a time when the critical thinking skills of our ancestors were far more infantile. But I understand why we created it, and I genuinely sympathize, really. You see, man felt so powerless, so petrified by death, so troubled by life's challenges. And of course, because he was raised by caring parents, had a carefree childhood. These were the wonderful days where he had no responsibility, no concern. Somebody was taking care of him. This same psychological childhood was projected into religion: God became the father, and in some cases, the mother. Religion, if you think about it, is the simple psychological projection of a child unwilling to accept responsibility. It has no basis in reality. And while one can very well choose to ignore reality, we can never ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.\n\nBut if you feel disappointed by reality, if you want to be experience majesty and transcendence, let me tell you that while I do not believe we are divinely created or divinely supervised, I am not untouched by the idea of awe and beauty. Take a moment to look at the images taken by the Hubble telescope. You can do it on your smartphone in an instant.\n\nImagine the extraordinary beauty of swirling new galaxies in color, intensity and splendor, like nothing the human eye has ever seen. Turn away from that if you wish, and gaze at a talking snake, in an illiterate desert part of the Middle East thousands of years ago, and tell me that that's where revelation and fulfillment comes from. I don't believe you'd be able to do it.\n\nWatch an episode of Cosmos on the absolute radiance and constancy of the universe. As Einstein once said of physics, \"The miracle is that there are no miracles.\" There are no interruptions in its order. It does not suspend itself simply to please some remote superstitious tribal sect. It's far beyond the whims of a small primate species on a tiny planet in a galaxy amongst innumerable others.\n\nI invite you to read Stephen Hawking's work on black holes, and their event horizons. The event horizon is the point at which the black hole is pulling everything into itself. It's so strong it can pull light from a star back into itself (Go ahead, Google 'Black hole pulling in a star'). That's really awe inspiring, a lot more inspiring than, say, a burning bush. That shouldn't impress any thinking person. Instead, picture a black hole, pulling light into itself and just reorganizing nature so immeasurably that if you could get to the lip of the event horizon and fall in, you could in theory see the past and the future stretching itself in front of you. You would see time itself. That is humbling; that is majesty and brilliance and beauty.\n\nSo, it is in the natural world, the world of science and skepticism and inquiry that you find awe. We would never have discovered any of this if everyone had accepted the religious stories to begin with, where you are told that you already know enough! God made us! There's no need for inquiry! You have all the information you can ever need!\n\nI am certain that I am not certain, but that it might be possible to find out, that the means to achieve wonder and symmetry and splendor is through innovation and skepticism. Beyond our peaks I can only see greater, more wonderful peaks. And I invite you, just for a moment, to open your minds to the possibility that doubt is better than anything that bears the label of faith. Because that which calls itself faith calls itself unquestionable, and for the unquestionable, I do not think that there is a place in an institute of scholarly education.", "Nothing to learn, everything to teach the poor children\n\nIn his speech to the Polish Sejm and Senate in 1990 (\"The future of Central Europe,\" New York Review of Books, 29 March 1990), Vaclav Havel exuded confidence that a \"rich Western Europe\" could receive Central Europe as someone \"who also brings something with him: namely spiritual and moral incentives, bold peace initiatives, untapped creative potential, the ethos of freshly gained freedom, and the inspiration for brave and swift solutions.\"\n\nBut as the right-wing historian Francois Furet mocked, \"With all the fuss and noise, not a single new idea has come out of Eastern Europe in 1989.\" In his captivating essay, Croatian Boris Buden (\"Children of postcommunism,\" Radical Philosophy, no. 159, 2010) punches the stuffing out of Furet's blather. Today, he says, Eastern and Central Europeans are treated by the West as children who have everything to learn and nothing to teach.\n\nCome, dear children, history is over, don't look back, look only forward to wealth and riches awaiting you. And don't be afraid of the marionette wires dangling you on the ground.\n\n\"Only yesterday,\" Buden proclaims, \"they [central and eastern Europeans] succeeded in in toppling totalitarian regimes in whose persistency and steadfastness the whole so-called 'free' and 'democratic world' had firmly believed, until the very last moment, and whose power it had feared as an other-worldly monster.\n\nIn the struggle against the communist threat, that world had mobilized all its political, ideological and military forces, its greatest statesman and generals, philosophers and spies, without ever really frightening the totalitarian beast. Yet, despite that, it calls those who chased it away with their bare hands 'children.'\"\n\nJan Komarek (\"Waiting for the existential revolution in Europe,\" revised paper prepared for the Conference 'Revisiting Van Gend en loos,' Paris 26-27 June, 2013) observes that the \"existential revolution\" called for by Havel failed to happen. The \"children of postcommunism\" were led by the hand into the promised land of liberal democracy and the market economy, away from silly and outmoded ideas such active citizenry, a mobilized civil society and provision for all.\n\nWhat did the poor children end up with? Uncompromisingly, Buden accuses the predatory elites of the nihilistic West of engaging in \"criminal privatization in which the wealth of whole nations has become the property of the few, almost overnight; for the new, postcommunist pauperization of the masses with all of its social and individual consequences; for historical regressions that in some places have thrown the postcommunist societies, culturally and morally, back below the levels that had already been reached under communism; and, finally, for all the nationalisms, racisms, bloody civil wars, and even genocides.\"\n\nThe power of the powerless\n\nBefore some of Havel's creative ideas and perspectives are lost forever, let's insist that we can still learn something from the old communist regimes and Havel in particular.\n\nThe Czech dissident, playwright and politician, Vaclav Havel, rejected the view that power is a lost cause, that we are condemned to play in our little private sandboxes while the larger world outside our playground goes to hell. In the late 1970s, Havel wrote his famous essay, \"The power of the powerless,\" the immediate aim of which was to explain the significance of Charter 77 to potential supporters within Czechoslovakia and encourage opponents of late-socialism in the Soviet bloc.\n\nHavel works with a fairly standard conception of power (the ability of certain humans to exercise their will over and against others). Yet the striking aspect of Havel's essay is its lack of deference to power. He questions the cynicism of those who curse the bastards and then drift with the tide or drink themselves into oblivion.\n\n\"The power of the powerless\" is definitely not attracted to institutional politics. He proposes that under any circumstances the downtrodden and oppressed always contain within themselves the power to remedy their own powerlessness. Consequently, they are the cause of their own continuing subordination.\n\nHavel arrived this startling and controversial idea (oppression never displaces political [or agentic] subjectivity entirely) through his own eastern European experience, namely that late socialism could not be reformed from within. The centre of political resistance was, in fact, the lifeworld. Here one could 'live in truth' (which he would later call 'anti-political politics'), shaking off the muck of the system. \"This system serves people only to the extent necessary to ensure that people will serve it,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Anything beyond this, that is to say, anything which leads people to overstep their predetermined roles is regarded by the system as an attack upon itself. And in this respect it is correct: every instance of such transgression is a genuine denial of the system.\" Thus, as long as individuals act as if they accept the system, the system will continue to be confirmed. As Havel counsels us, citizens can say enough is enough. The green grocer can simply refuse to keep the party's sign in his window. We can stop lying to ourselves and to others.\n\nUpending the taken-for-granted\n\nHavel's daring thesis upended the presumption that the Gullivers who command states and have the weapons of coercive power at their disposal (guns, armies, propagandists, and so on) will have things their way, forever. Those who speak of sovereign power should not have the last word in politics. In effect, Havel argues that under certain circumstances the powerful are powerless. Their powerlessness is traceable to five related factors.\n\nTo start with, the powerful can never control the micro-movements of all of their subjects. They can never find quite enough spies to sit in every coffee shop; they cannot watch every living room. The powerful may wish to reduce the citizen to a cog in the machine, but usually they are too stupid or conservative to do that all the time.\n\nSecond, the power structure depends upon ideological rituals that become less and less credible (as well as bypassing public debate) as the people become less and less happy. Here a third consideration arises: some may call the ideology a lie, declaring the emperor's thoughts naked. This possibility, Havel says, is nurtured by the ontological fact that the \"every day, thankless, and never-ending struggle of human beings to live more freely, truthfully, and in quiet dignity\" is ultimately not completely repressible.\n\nFourth, misery appears to nip at the heels of imagination, forcing the mind to reflect on the human condition. How has life come to this? Does it have to remain this way? Who is responsible for our suffering? Finally, individuals who live in truth reject the innocent fiction that power is a thing to be grasped or abolished. For Havel, power is not something one has; it is relational, so power relations are not reducible to the instruments of power.\n\nEach individual is caught within a labyrinth of influence, repression, fear and self-censorship which swallows everyone within it, at the very least rendering them silent. Every person is both the victim and supporter of the system -and potential opponent. These five affirmations are the core of Havel's \"existential revolution.\"\n\nSince the lines of organized power within the system pass like low-current electricity through all its subjects, the latter can defend themselves only by preventing the system from ruining their personal lives. Those who choose to live in truth effect something of an existential revolution. They must agree that there are some things worth suffering for, and be prepared to say out loud what others think only in solitude.\n\nWe have arrived at the heart of Havel's affirmation of political agency: the person can always act (write an open letter, hold a rock concert, a demonstration, or go on a hunger strike).The effective power of these acts cannot be judged in conventional political terms. Yet living in truth is a risky business. The consequences for the individual are unclear, but these acts can be surprisingly effective.\n\nTo be sure, totalitarian regimes can hound citizens, drag them from their beds, lock them up in psychiatric wards, beat them silly, even murder them. But such tactics prove the point: the powerless have within themselves the power to obstruct normality, to embarrass the authorities, to point to the possibility of living life differently -according to values like trust, openness, responsibility, solidarity, love.\n\nLiving in truth begins at the existential level\n\nLiving in truth (living authentically) begins, then, at the existential level. Although it can manifest in collective actions, it is essentially local, invisible, anti-political (that is, it is not committed to playing the game invented by the regime). The strategy of living in truth turns away from forming an institutional party. Living in truth is for this reason most ethically effective when it keeps its distance from formal politics. They must grasp that a better system will not ensure a better life.\n\nIn an influential essay written before 1989, \"Politics and conscience,\" Havel tells us what he means by \"anti-political politics.\" He says: \"I favor 'anti-political politics,' that is, politics not as the technology of power and manipulation, of cybernetic rule over humans or as the art of the utilitarian, but politics as one of the ways of seeking and achieving meaningful lives, of protecting them and serving them.\" I like this statement.\n\nIdentifying politics with \"practical morality\", Havel knew that many would see this as utterly impractical. Indeed, critics chided Havel and other dissidents because they left the door open for cynical technocrats to rush in and proceed to knock citizens out of the ring and demonize socialists. The latter critique stings.\n\nLiving in truth required the cultivation of mechanisms of individuation, self-protection and co-operation in areas underneath and beyond the reach of the state -within the household, among friends, at the office, within the parallel economy and sphere of unofficial culture. Perhaps the left humanist culture can begin to imagine something like a counter-polis or \"parliament of civil society\" that, with imagination and verve, could mount a serious offensive against a depleted democratic society in neo-liberal times.\n\nIn a phrase, the empowerment of the powerless first and foremost requires individuals to build open, flexible structures of resistance that run parallel to and underneath the late-socialist state. This is best accomplished from below through small-scale initiatives. We cannot give up building \"small, beautiful places\" where we are living, now. If we are watched from above, let's go below. If truth and enlightenment retreat from public culture, let's build centres of light and truth where we are situated. Let's dig where we stand. The latter phrase has its origins in the Swedish popular education movement.\n\nSome questions for Havel\n\nThere are some limitations to Havel's arguments. He avoids the different interpretations of what it means to live in truth. He may also downplay the truth that we generally do not love truthful living very much (it is very hard), and the hypnotic effects of the system bind us tightly.\n\nThe pessimistic proponents of the post-political thesis would query Havel's abandonment of politics - the messy and complicated activity of collectively encouraging individuals to live in truth and thereby decide who gets what, when and how. Some civil society proponents would require a parliament-civil society dialectic for people's voices to be articulated and then taken seriously by policy-makers.\n\nPerhaps Havel and other eastern European intellectuals so feared the actually existing world of corrupt party politics that they thought it was non-redeemable.\n\nHavel also eschews talk of parliaments, armies, police forces, civil service or local government. Always, for Havel, the primacy of the individual's existence over the institutional frameworks within which they live. For me, Havel's separation of the person from institutional framework reflects an important historical moment, a way of conceiving resistance and hope.\n\nIt ought not to be generalized into a normative \"anti-politics\" for everyone. Developmental humanists and proponents of the just learning society must view Havel's recovery of the person as moral agent as a necessary conceptual retrieval for contemporary Left humanist practice. This new culture must be built within the ruins of global cultures of destruction and mindlessness.\n\nHavel believes that only when the \"independent life of society\" is cultivated can the powerless be prevented from becoming new masters. Havel called this new and desperate possibility \"social self-organization.\" Soon thereafter, with greater confidence and precision, it would be called civil society (J. Keane, Vaclav Havel: a political tragedy in six acts [2000, pp. 268-86].\n\nThe resonance of Havel's existentialism in the West\n\nKomarek (2013) thinks that the \"reason Havel's essay resonated so much in the West and still speaks to (some of) us today was that Havel did not limit his ethical claim to the people living in the conditions of post-totalitarianism. What he called for was nothing less than an 'existential revolution', aimed at the crisis of contemporary society as a whole -liberal West and post-totalitarian East alike.\" The main conductor of moral and spiritual critiques of the West and the post-totalitarian East in our world today is Russia.\n\nSkeptical of classical parliamentary traditions, Havel has offered us an existential revolution that would lead to a \"new experience of being, a renewed rootedness in the universe, a newly grasped sense of higher responsibility, and a newfound inner relationship to other people and to the human community.\" These are spiritual and moral yearnings; they are not mere utopian posturing.", "It's Oscars weekend and Leonardo DiCaprio is up for his sixth Academy Award nominations for best actor, despite never so far having gone home with a trophy.\n\nHowever. he got nothing on Wales' own late acting legend Richard Burton, who, despite having spent a whopping 6268 on screen minutes (that's nearly twice as many as the 41-year-old star of The Revenant) during his long career, never actually came good on any of his seven nods at Oscar glory.\n\nPontrhydyfen-born Burton, who received nominations of his roles in the likes of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, Equus and Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe?, also saw of the A'list types of Johnny Depp (three nominations) and Sly Stallone, Tom Cruise and Joaquin Phoenix - all of whom have experience three near misses apiece.\n\nHowever, while Burton might once have been dubbed the 'world's greatest living actor' he didn't always make the right choice when it came to picking his roles.\n\nSo here, in celebration of this wayward homegrown talent, we pick some of his performances that range from the good to the bad to the downright weird.\n\nExorcist II (1977)\n\nBurton made some terrible movies in his time, sleepwalking his way through a number of inferior roles with one eye on the pay-cheque and the other on the mini-bar.\n\nFew came close to Exorcist II: The Heretic though - an unintelligible, pretentious mess once voted number two in a list of The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made.\n\nAnd, like Linda Blair's projectile vomiting character in the original movie, audiences felt similarly queasy.\n\nNot through revulsion at the gory happenings on screen though, more the sudden realisation they could have instead used the money they'd forked out on cinema tickets to enjoy a pint or several down the pub.\n\nAfter all, that's what Burton would've done.\n\nThe Last Days of Dolwyn (1949)\n\nBurton's first foray into pictures since leaving the RAF, in which he served as a navigator during WWII, Dolwyn certainly hasn't made our list on the strength of the 23-year-old's fledgling performance.\n\nMore over, it's worth watching to see just how far Neath Port Talbot's most famous son would have to go before he'd become a bona fide Hollywood legend.\n\nVery much a diamond in the rough at that stage in his career, you can just about make out that bristle of electricity which would, one day, captivate audiences everywhere.\n\nAnd while it's recognisably Burton you're watching, it doesn't sound like him at all - that deep rumbling timbre with which he'd become synonymous still not having formed by that point.\n\nIt's a shock, like watching Dirty Harry and only realising when Clint Eastwood opens his mouth that he's been dubbed by Joe Pasquale.\n\nStaircase (1969)\n\nHe was a hard-living, fiery Welshman who women wanted to be with and men wanted to get drunk with.\n\nSo it's not surprising that any flick in which Burton played a gay hairdresser in a head bandage alongside Doctor Dolittle's Rex Harrison would 'do little' at the box office.\n\nIn fact, except for the scene where a Burton takes a bath, naked save for a floral showercap, it's been all but forgotten among the actor's back catalogue.\n\n1984 (er, 1984, obviously)\n\nUnsurprisingly, it's Burton's final role as O'Brien, the totalitarian torturer in George Orwell's dystopian nightmare, that remains his most memorable - not least for the fact he died before the film got its British premiere .\n\nPale, with pitted skin and slicked back hair, his chillingly cold-eyed compassionless turn clearly served as blueprint for Anthony Hopkins' take on a certain cannibalistic serial killer several year later.\n\nIt also put many people off going to the dentist for ages afterwards.\n\nHammersmith Is Out (1972)\n\nTalking of Hannibal Lecter, this unhinged turn saw him channelling the same forboding presence that would win Anthony Hopkins the Oscar for Silence of The Lambs some 16 years later.\n\nDirected by Peter Ustinov, it stars Burton - replete with straight jacket, pair of spats and a wetted-down mullet - as a sinister mental patient who tries talking his way out of a Texan asylum.\n\nSpeaking in a diabolically low growl, Burton sounds like he not only smokes 40-a-day but licks the ashtrays clean too.\n\nHere's Lucy (1970)\n\nFed up with being unable to go sightseeing without being mobbed - \"everyone's been to Disneyland except me and Khrushchev\" - the Pontrhydyfen star dons a janitor's uniform to slip by his waiting fans in this episode of Lucille Ball's popular US sitcom.\n\nHowever, the plan backfires when the comedian mistakes Burton for a handyman and press-gangs him in to fixing her leaky faucet - upon which Burton gives a rendition of a speech from act three, scene two of Richard II in order to convince her he's actually a famous actor.\n\n\"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings,\" he recites in those brown, fruity vowels, before cursing Ball in Welsh for criticising his performance - \"Better stick to plumbing\" - and having the temerity to ask if he was English.\n\nImage Hyperlink Example", "Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, this week sounded an unusually strong -- and therefore welcome -- warning about the continuing bias against Israel in the corridors of the world body.\n\nOn a visit to Israel, Power spoke publicly about the experience of ZAKA, an Israeli humanitarian aid organization, in its efforts to gain accreditation at the U.N. After describing Zaka's venerable record of assistance not just in Israel, but in New York City after the 9/11 atrocities and in Haiti after the devastating earthquake there in 2010, the ambassador pointed out that when, in 2013, the agency applied for accreditation to the U.N.'s NGO committee, it was flatly denied. It took another five attempts before the same committee until the accreditation was granted, thanks to pressure from Power herself along with Israeli diplomats.\n\nIn the same speech, Power reflected that \"bias has extended well beyond Israel as a country [to] Israel as an idea.\" In particular, she noted the insidious role of the U.N.'s Human Rights Council. Power said, \"The only country in the world with a standing agenda item at the Human Rights Council is not North Korea, a totalitarian state that is currently holding an estimated 100,000 people in gulags; not Syria, which has gassed its people -- lots of them. It is Israel.\"\n\nIt should be remembered that the Human Rights Council was created in 2006 to replace the old Commission on Human Rights. At the time, the outgoing U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, expressed hope that the new Council would break with the past, by preventing serial human rights abusers from gaining membership as easily as they had with the previous Commission, and by shifting away from the excessive focus on Israel. So Power's remarks confirm that this goal has yet to be attained.\n\nShe's right, too, about the bias in the U.N. against Israel \"as an idea.\" The roots of the rot go very deep.\n\nFifty years ago, when the West Bank was still occupied by Jordan, the Soviet Union began a campaign that was to culminate in the 1975 U.N. General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism. The Israeli scholars Joel Fishman and Yohanan Manor have unearthed how, in the October 1965 proceedings of one of its sub-committees, the Soviets responded to a joint U.S.-Brazil resolution condemning anti-Semitism with an amendment urging the inclusion of \"Zionism\" as well. So let there be no doubt: Before there was an \"Israeli occupation,\" there was a demonization campaign against the Jewish nature of the state underway.\n\nBy the time the General Assembly passed Resolution 3379 in 1975, the key slander it contained -- the bracketing of the national liberation movement of the Jewish people with South African apartheid -- was already a familiar one in the halls of the U.N. It fed on the same poisonous atmosphere, marked by terrorism and the constant threat of a Middle East war, that birthed such horrors as the Red Army Fraction, a group of well-heeled German students who hijacked planes and murdered Jews and others in the name of the Palestinian cause. And it remained on the books for 16 years before it was rescinded in a curt, single-line resolution on the eve of the historic 1991 Middle East peace conference.\n\nThe problem is that the U.N. continues to behave as if it regards Zionism as a form of racism. And the reason for that is simple. Structurally, nothing has changed at the U.N. since the coming, and then going, of Resolution 3379. The systemic bias identified by Power remains because the same bodies that have targeted Israel in the past continue to do so now.\n\nIt's not just the Human Rights Council. On the same day that it passed the Zionism-is-racism resolution, the General Assembly created the memorably named \"Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People,\" along with an entire \"Division of Palestinian Rights\" for research, information, and propaganda requirements. For more than 40 years now, the U.N. has annually spent several million dollars of member-state money on NGO conferences on the Palestinian territories, \"fact-finding\" junkets composed of minor officials who decide that Israel is guilty before they even reach the airport, and endless resolutions and reports that cement the false image of Israel as a rogue state.\n\nThe Palestinian People Committee's report to the General Assembly for its 2015 activities tells you all you need to know about how anti-Israel bias works its way through the U.N. system. Inter alia, we learn that one \"Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\" delivered a lecture as part of the \"International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.\" We are told about the economic costs of the \"occupation,\" but the rife corruption in the Palestinian Authority that has eaten billions of dollars in aid money isn't mentioned. At another point, we are informed that calculating the \"occupation's cost\" is \"complex and multidimensional, requiring expertise in economics, law, history, and politics.\" Preferably acquired at the Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, I'll wager.\n\nThese and similar ignominies are documented on a regular basis by U.N. Watch, which also reports diligently on those human rights crises ignored by the U.N. But what hasn't yet happened is an international discussion about the future of the Palestinian People Committee and its associated bodies.\n\nHence my suggestion. Since the U.N. doesn't like abolishing existing committees, why not replace the Palestinian People Committee with another body dedicated to all stateless nations and minorities? That would include the Palestinians, but also the Kurds, the Sahrawis, and the Tibetans. It would underline international awareness of vulnerable minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. And it could avoid political controversies by focusing on education and human rights.\n\nTrue, this new committee would carry its own set of problems, whatever final form it takes: nothing is ever easy at the U.N. But democratic member states need to understand that as long as the bodies dedicated to anti-Israel propaganda remain active within the U.N. structure, very little is going to change. Are we going to have this same conversation for the next 50 years?", "Certificates in nationalism are being distributed. Have you applied? To qualify, an aspirant must scream \"Pakistan murdabad\". An additional qualification would be an ability to send anybody to Pakistan who does not adhere to \"one language, one faith, one nation\" ideology. An inability to conduct a civilised discourse shall not be a disqualification. But, guess, who is issuing certificates of nationalism? Lawyers who take pride in bashing up the accused on court premises. And a couple of BJP legislators, one of them having undertaken the mundane task of counting the number of used condoms, beer bottles, cigarettes, etc. in Jawaharlal Nehru University. The other, a Delhi legislator last seen manhandling an activist not matching his definition of nationalism or patriotism. He surely cannot make out one from the other.\n\nAll these thoughts struck my mind over the past few days as, first the Rohit Vemula tragedy unfolded, then the JNU controversy erupted. Last week when I attended a march by authors, artists and academics in favour of the JNU students, I heard slogans which initially did not seem directly linked to the arrest of Kanhaiya or the disappearance of Umar Khalid. The students, asking for the release of Kanhaiya shouted, \"Fascism down, down\". The attention shifted to the police commissioner Bassi followed soon after by cries of \"Sanghis, down, down\". Then there were noises of \"Manuvad down down\". It seemed an all-encompassing cry. Besides expressing their angst at caste and class ridden society, the students seemed to be answering the charges of sedition, terrorism and anti-nationalism levelled against some of their college mates and friends.\n\nIt was followed by a counter march wherein the Right Wing activists agitated more vehemently, with a lawyer threatening to use petrol bomb on Umar Khalid. It was sickening. And I wondered where do these guys draw their vitriol from? From where have they inherited that acute inability to see beyond prejudice? After all, be it the ABVP or the BJP, they all draw their ideological fuel from the RSS, the very body that for more than half a century refused to hoist the Tricolour, the organisation that stood opposed to India being a \"sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic\", and even now wants India to be a Hindu Rashtra.\n\nAround the same time I received Shamsul Islam's thin but extremely well researched book \"Know the RSS\", published by Pharos Media. Based on RSS documents, the book, now into its seventh revised edition, cleared many a cobweb. My doubts about the \"Fascism, down, down\" slogans were answered at the beginning where Islam draws a neat parallel between Hitler and M.S. Golwalkar.\n\n\"Golwalkar unhesitatingly wanted to model his Hindu Rashtra or Nation on Hitler's totalitarian and fascist pattern,\" writes Islam, going on to quote the RSS ideologue from the book \"We or Our Nationhood Defined\". \"It is worth bearing well in mind how these old Nations solve their minorities problem. They do not undertake to recognize any separate element in their polity. Emigrants have to get themselves naturally assimilated in the principal mass of the population, the National Race, by adopting its culture and language and sharing in its aspirations, by losing all consciousness of their separate existence....If they do not do so, they live merely as outsiders, bound by codes and conventions of the Nation, at the sufferance of the Nation.\"\n\nSimilarly, V.D. Savarkar with whose ideology the Right Wing nurses clear similarities, wrote in favour of Hitler. \"There is no reason to suppose that Hitler must be a human monster because he passes off as a Nazi.\" Lending greater strength to Islam's findings are some tweets of artistes clearly Right inclined. For instance, Anupam Kher tweeted in Hindi, \"Gharon mein pest control hota hai to cockroach, keede makode ityadi bahar nikalte hain. Ghar saaf hota hai. Waise hi aajkal desh ka pest control chal raha hai. ( When you use pest control in your house, you see cockroach, insects and vermin popping out of their hiding. This cleanses the house. Likewise, the pest control of the entire country is being carried out at the moment.)\" Kher's words were almost a reproduction of Hitler's who referred to Jews as insects, vermin and bacteria!\n\nBack to the book: Islam reproduces how the RSS was against the Tricolour and Golwalkar while addressing a Gurupurnima gathering about a year before Independence, said, \"It was the saffron flag which in totality represented Bhartiya culture. It was the embodiment of God. We firmly believe that in the end the whole nation will bow before this saffron flag.\"\n\nThat Golwalkar still has his followers became clear a few days after the march when 50-year-old Yunus Sheikh, assistant sub-inspector in Latur, was paraded with a bhagwa dhwaj chanting 'Jai bhawani' slogans by Right Wing elements. Not a voice was heard from Nagpur or Jhandewalan, denouncing the action. Nobody cried sedition. Nobody reminded the cop's kidnappers of the Constitution. I read up Golwalkar again through Islam's book. He reproduces a statement of Golwalkar from \"Bunch of Thoughts\" which is not only a selection of the writings of Golwalkar but also a Bible for the RSS cadre. \"Our Constitution too is just a cumbersome and heterogeneous piecing together of various articles from various Constitutions of Western countries. It has absolutely nothing which can be called our own'....In fact, RSS wanted this Constitution to be replaced by Manusmriti or Manu Code which is known for its derogatory and inhuman references to Shudras, Untouchables and women. When the Constituent Assembly of India finalized the Constitution, RSS was not happy. Its organ, 'Organiser' complained, \"But in our Constitution there is no mention of the unique constitutional development in ancient Bharat'. Manu's laws were written long before Sparta.\" With a reproduction of Manu's laws wherein he wants a Shudra's arm to be chopped off for raising his hand at a Brahmin, Islam clears the picture about the kind of India those resorting to violence on the street want.\n\nBut what about charges of anti-nationalism? Surely there can be many ways of being an Indian? You can't be anti-nation if you sing \"Sare jahan se achcha Hindustan hamara\" just as you do not become more patriotic by merely singing \"Vande Mataram\".\n\nToday, self-confessed perjurers are claiming monopoly over nationalism. Right Wing prejudice cannot pass off as the thought of the nation. Rather than be lost in the din, pick up Shamsul Islam's book. Reading him is far from exhilarating. It is demanding, requiring both an open heart and a level head. In the end though, it is worth it.", "Before David Cameron flew back from Brussels, last week's political headlines were briefly dominated by a tussle between a man who has taken a vow of poverty and a billionaire tycoon. At an appearance in Mexico, Pope Francis criticised US presidential hopeful Donald Trump's stance on immigration. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\" Trump has pledged to build a multi-billion-dollar wall across the US-Mexican border.\n\nWith his characteristic humility (and cavalier attitude towards grammar), Trump replied: \"If and when the Vatican is attacked by Isis... the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president.\" Trump's supporters also noted that the 110-acre Vatican City is itself partially walled, ignoring the fact that, as CNN's Daniel Burke noted, \"anyone can stroll through the Pope's front yard - St. Peter's Square - at nearly any time\".\n\nThe real problem with walls - apart from that they're mostly built by totalitarian regimes - is that they don't work particularly well. The Great Wall of China, which Trump has mentioned approvingly, took 1,000 years and an estimated 400,000 lives to build.\n\nYet it failed to keep out invading forces. But perhaps the best example is the Venetian fortress city of Palmanova. Construction of this utopian Renaissance new town began in 1593. As Michael Caines points out in The Independent, its wall was \"intended to express ideals of social harmony\" as well as \"warding off any barbarians at the gates\".\n\nYet despite costing about three million ducats (\u00a3300m in today's money), it was so suffocating that \"nobody wanted to live there\". Eventually, \"the Venetians resorted to pardoning criminals and offering them financial incentives to settle\". By the time it was occupied by Napoleon in the 19th century, the \"immobile Renaissance Death Star\" had become a \"miserable little town\".\n\nSympathy for traffic wardens\n\nParking wardens and traffic police are not universally loved. Like many motorists, I've often wondered whether they're more concerned with raising revenue than ensuring road safety.However, sometimes it's hard not to feel sympathy for them.\n\nOne 21-year-old Australian woman, Beth Louise Jarvis, has racked up A$153,000 (\u00a378,000) in unpaid traffic fines in more than 200 separate offences. With little power to force her to pay, the authorities are publishing her name, along with those of other miscreants, in an effort to shame her into coughing up.\n\nPerhaps Ms Jarvis should consider moving to Europe, where there is a more casual attitude to such things. The first traffic camera installed above a stop sign in France caught 517 motorists ignoring it in just one day. The police did the only thing they could: they prosecuted those who didn't even bother slowing down and let the rest off with a verbal warning. Vive la diff\u00e9rence, indeed!\n\nTabloid money: going for a song on eBay - an airbag, one careful owner\n\n* \"In 1980 a first-class stamp would set you back 12p,\" says the Daily Express. However, that cost is now due to rise to 64p, with a second-class stamp costing 55p. Much of the rise has come in recent years, after price controls were scrapped in 2012 - second-class stamps are now 53% higher than in 2011. Yet, \"the postal service is not a patch on what it was ten, 20 or 30 years ago... you cannot guarantee that a letter sent first class will arrive the next day\". Of course, \"the world has moved on, with email playing an ever greater role in daily life\". But \"a lot of people are still heavily reliant on the postal service and send far more than 52 letters a year\". These people \"need a reliable postal service\".\n\n* Police have issued a warning about fake airbags being sold on eBay, writes a perplexed Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun. \"Who would buy an airbag from eBay?\" After all, \"it's not something even the most skilled DIY enthusiast would be able to fit\". Mind you, those selling them might have hit upon the \"perfect crime... if you sell someone a fake air bag, they only realise they've been had as they are flying though the windscreen on their way to the Pearly Gates\".\n\n* Prince William is living the life of Riley, says Carole Malone in the Daily Mirror. \"He does so few royal engagements these days that it's embarrassing.\" And \"he's rarely at the 22-room Kensington Palace apartment, which taxpayers paid \u00a34m to renovate\".\n\nSure, the Duchess of Cambridge has had two children in the past three years, but \"so have lots of couples who still manage to do full-time jobs without the help, the money and the advantages these two have\". Instead of \"being the man to modernise the royals\", the prince \"is fast becoming the Prince Andrew of his generation - the one who ducks out of much of the work but still expects all the perks afforded by his surname\".", "BETHLEHEM>> Through a process of improvisation and careful character analysis, the Woodhall Players have developed a unique interpretation of George Orwell's classic fable, \"Animal Farm,\" which they will present Feb. 19-20 at 7:30 p.m. From the start, it became evident that the company could produce a cute \"kids\" version of the play or something edgier, and, as usual, the Woodhall Players chose the riskier path. Collaborating with Larry Hunt, an internationally acknowledged mask artist, the students have crafted an evening of theatre, which amuses and unnerves the viewer at the same time. The production is performed with the barest minimum of sets and costumes; as usual, it is all about the acting. Within a parable using farm animals, Orwell raises a challenging question about humans' natural proclivity toward violence and totalitarianism, and the answers can make us uncomfortable.

It is hard to do under any conditions. And against the backdrop of a totalitarian state it's even harder. The Square does not guarantee success with such a number of people. We can only agitate the power. A complete mobilization of sole traders is needed to organize the Square,\" - Ales Makayeu said in an interview to Euroradio.\n\nFor that end Makayeu goes to the regions to visit small markets. He says that intelligence agencies, and the KGB in particular, are working hard for separation of sole traders. The authorities really do not want small businessmen to stand together.\n\nOn the other hand, Ales Makayeu is convinced that sooner or later the consolidation should take place, as there are no deep disagreements between the leaders. All the minor can be easily resolved at the negotiating table:\n\n\"I believe the sole traders' consolidation will take place. I support the idea that the leaders of business organizations have no quarrel with each other. The most important thing about what they say and what they do is the protection of sole traders' rights. And we have no disagreements on that count. If there are some tactical issues, which law needs to be changed, that will be resolved by mere negotiations,\" - the leader of sole traders said.\n\nWe remind that the next rally of sole traders is to be held on Kastrychnitskaya Square in Minsk on February 28, at 15:00.", "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Next time you visit your doctor, be careful how you respond to his questions, or you may just be branded \"mentally ill\" and subjected to \"treatment.\" That is because a panel advising the Obama administration, in partnership with Big Psychiatry, wants to make doctors subject all American adults and children over age 12 to screening for alleged \"mental health\" disorders -- particularly depression, at least to start with. Then, anyone found to harbor any alleged mental disorder, including children as young as eight, should undergo \"therapy,\" often including powerful psychotropic medications that experts say have dubious value but often come with well-documented and highly dangerous side effects.\n\nYour ObamaCare plan will be forced to pay for it, whether you want it or not, thanks to the federal government's commandeering of the health-insurance industry under the so-called Affordable Care Act. And eventually, younger and younger children will be in Big Brother's crosshairs for mental and behavioral health \"services,\" whether parents want it or not. School teachers, social workers, and more are all already being enlisted in the federal government's search for supposed \"mental and behavioral health\" issues -- a list that is perpetually expanding as psychiatrists invent new \"illnesses.\" The outcry against the federal government's obsession with your mind and the minds of America's children, though, is growing louder, as critics call the agenda \"depressing\" and worry whether it is another scheme to disarm more Americans.\n\nThe controversial \"recommendations\" include screening all Americans between the ages of 12 and 18 for depression. A separate but related recommendation seeks to have all U.S. adults checked for \"mental illness,\" too. And consider that the list of \"illnesses\" is subjective (homosexuality was a mental disorder a few decades ago) and is constantly expanding as psychiatrists vote to create new ones, literally, as part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -- the \"Bible\" of psychiatry that has been widely criticized, even by leading psychiatrists.\n\nThe latest demands come from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF. The influential outfit, appointed by the Obama administration's increasingly radical Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recommends various unconstitutional federal health policies for Big Brother to decree into pseudo-law via regulation.\n\nIts latest recommendations for children and adolescents 12 and older were published earlier this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \"The USPSTF recommends screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years,\" the HHS task force said in the summary of its position. \"Screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up.\" Why the federal government believes it has any business coming between patients and doctors -- or where it believes the constitutional authority for such meddling is found -- was not immediately clear.\n\nThe outfit also left the door open for recommending such \"screening\" for children under 12, too. \"The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for MDD in children aged 11 years and younger,\" the Obama HHS panel wrote. The recommendations also call for using controversial medications such as Prozac to drug children between 12 and 17, while advocating powerful psychotropic substances such as Lexapro for children as young as eight.\n\nAlready, about one in 10 American school-aged boys has been labeled and drugged under the guise of \"Attention Deficit Disorder\" (ADD) and \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\" (ADHD). However, even the late Dr. Leon Eisenberg, often described as the \"father\" or \"inventor\" of the diagnosis, said before his death in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel that the alleged disease was \"a prime example of a fabricated disorder.\" With the list of \"disorders\" expanding rapidly, and with that list labeling more and more normal behaviors as symptoms of alleged illness, critics have warned that the trend is deeply troubling.\n\nWhen it comes to adults, the advisory panel, which purports to be independent, wants to cast an even broader net. \"The USPSTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum women,\" said the outfit, which adds that its views should not be construed as the official position of the \"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\" or Obama's HHS. \"Screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up.\"\n\nIn its \"rationale\" for recommending that all U.S. adults be screened for depression, the panel claims that the \"illness\" is \"common in patients seeking care in the primary care setting.\" It also cites \"adequate evidence\" allegedly showing some \"improvements\" if its advice is followed.\n\nThen, unsurprisingly, the outfit downplays the very serious risks documented by The New American magazine and many other sources -- including government and Big Pharma itself. For instance, the panel admits that antidepressants are \"associated\" with harms, including an increase in suicidal behavior, an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, fetal harm, and more. But despite that, the task force \"concludes with at least moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit\" to screening all American adults. And by all, the task force means all: \"The USPSTF recommends screening in all adults regardless of risk factors,\" it said.\n\nBig Pharma and Big Government were no doubt pleased with the conclusion. But not everyone was. Among those expressing concerns was Dr. Ron Paul, the liberty-minded former congressman from Texas and GOP presidential contender, who called the proposed mandatory screenings a \"depressing thought\" in his weekly column. \"Basic economics, as well as the Obamacare disaster, should have shown this task force that government health insurance mandates harm Americans,\" wrote Paul, a medical doctor. He warned that, among other problems, the scheme would raise insurance costs. Even more troubling is that it would likely result in new federal databases containing the results of the screenings, which would be used to deny even more Americans their right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\"Today, some mental health professionals think that those who believe in limited government, free-market economics, or traditional values suffer from mental disorders,\" Paul explained, echoing growing concerns among watchdogs monitoring the psychiatric industry. \"If mandatory depression screening becomes a reality, it is likely this mental health screening will be expanded to cover screening for other mental illnesses. This could result in anyone with an unpopular political belief or lifestyle choice being labeled as 'mentally ill.'\"\n\nOther commentators also directly suggested that the new demands for more \"mental health\" screening may be related to Obama's agenda to infringe on gun rights. \"With executive actions aimed at getting guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, the timing of this report's release is rather curious,\" wrote Trey Sanchez with Truth Revolt, a conservative-leaning outlet. \"It seems reasonable to assume that mass screenings will produce more diagnoses of depression, even for those patients who showed up a little blue that day. But maybe that's the point: the more people there are that can be labeled 'mentally ill' (indeed a disservice to those suffering from actual mental illnesses), the less gun permits approved.\"\n\nIt is hardly the first time in recent memory that Obama's HHS has demanded extreme and anti-constitutional intrusions under the guise of \"health.\" Indeed, the HHS has become increasingly bold in its demands for totalitarianism. Last year, for example, it unveiled a push to target American adults with vaccine mandates. In collaboration with Big Business and special interests, bureaucrats outlined the \"National Adult Immunization Plan\" (NAIP) to track Americans' vaccination records, wage a massive propaganda campaign to \"encourage\" more inoculations, and foist more controversial vaccines on adults against their will. Critics noted that the agenda includes eventually imposing vaccines at gunpoint.\n\nMore recently, HHS, in partnership with the increasingly radical U.S. Department of Education, unveiled a draft policy statement in which families are referred to as Big Brother's \"equal partners\" in child rearing. As if that was not enough, the document called for expanding \"home visitation\" programs. \"Home visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during pregnancy and in the first years of life can make a tremendous difference in the lives of many children and their families,\" argued Obama's HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell last year in announcing more \"grants\" to send government workers to family homes.\n\nThe \"equal partners\" scheme also comes with important \"mental health\" implications, as the policy statement makes clear. \"Ensure constant monitoring and communication regarding children's social-emotional and behavioral health,\" the document demands. \"Ensure that children's social-emotional and behavioral needs are met and that families and staff are connected with relevant community partners, such as early childhood mental health consultants and children's medical homes.\" In the policy statement's \"recommendations\" for states -- much of which will be imposed through federal bribes -- state governments are told to \"expand early childhood mental health consultation efforts.\"\n\nOf course, there is no constitutional authority for federally mandated \"mental health\" exams or any other meddling in healthcare or family life. Nor is there authority for a Department of \"Health and Human Services\" to exist. As HHS and other unconstitutional agencies continue to expand, so does the threat they pose to the liberties, well-being, and prosperity of the American people. It is time for the public to demand that Congress defund and shut down all unconstitutional agencies before the lawlessness and totalitarianism become even more extreme.", "From mass deportations, to torture and waterboarding, to dipping bullets in pig's blood, Donald Trump is systematically redefining what is acceptable to say in American politics and perhaps eventually what is acceptable to do in American government. Election year 2016 is coming to seem like a remake of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco's play Rhinoceros, a surreal cautionary tale in which ordinary people, one by one, give up their humanity to the twin fevers of totalitarianism and rage.\n\nTrump's challenge to the U.S. Constitution is only one subchapter of that story; but the damage he is doing is real, and he's not finished yet.\n\nConsider that last weekend, Trump began to deploy his birther libel -- first wheeled out against Barack Obama and then Ted Cruz -- against Marco Rubio. His claims are only increasing in scope. Obama, Trump claimed, was not born in the United States. (He was.) Cruz was born (to an American citizen mother) in Canada. Trump says that means he's not a natural-born citizen. (He is.) No one questions that Rubio was born in the United States. His parents were lawful permanent residents. The Constitution, on this point at least, is blessedly clear. To be born in the United States is to be born a citizen. Trump doesn't question that. Not quite. Not yet. But late last week, he retweeted a supporter who suggested that Rubio is ineligible for the White House. When George Stephanopoulos asked him why he had done that, Trump responded: \"Because I'm not sure. I mean, let people make their own determination.\"\n\nThis is the way that Trump insinuates lies and libels into the discussion. It's not me, he feigns, others have questions about Rubio, I'm just saying it could be a problem, and maybe we should look into it. Similarly, after repeating a supporter's invective against Cruz, Trump shrugs: Hey, I didn't make the indecent and sexist comment about Cruz. What can I do? My supporters are passionate. But that was just the start. By the Iowa caucuses, he was calling the Texas senator \"the Canadian anchor baby.\" Rubio can expect the same treatment.\n\nI find no merit in the claims that Cruz isn't eligible. First, the \"legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and '90s\" -- which the Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe has used against Cruz -- don't support the idea that an \"originalist\" judge would find Cruz ineligible. At any rate, it's irrelevant; under the Constitution, citizenship is regulated by Congress, and the statutes in effect at the time Cruz was born leave no room for doubt. He is a born citizen, as eligible as any other to run for the presidency. The Constitution leaves many things up to Congress, and under the naturalization clause, one of them is citizenship. Beyond that, Dan Brown-style archeology is not a proper tool of constitutional interpretation, and pretending it is just emboldens the far-right's outlandish claims about \"original intent\" in contexts like birthright citizenship and public land ownership. Trump and his claque are now moving the goalpost again, and the weak response fom constitutional scholars to the Cruz smear will make it harder to refute Trump's new claim.\n\nTribe, who elevated Trump's anti-Cruz rhetoric with an op-ed in The Boston Globe on January 11, instead muddied the waters. His insinuations themselves were positively Trumpian: I myself of course don't doubt the senator's eligibility. I'm just saying, \"the kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court\" is also the kind of judge who would argue that \"Cruz ironically wouldn't be eligible\" to become president. Tribe cites no real evidence for this claim. In fact, the op-ed itself could be seen as a kind of humorless academic prank:\n\nWhen Cruz was my constitutional law student at Harvard, he aced the course after making a big point of opposing my views in class -- arguing stridently for sticking with the \"original meaning\" against the idea of a more elastic \"living Constitution\" whenever such ideas came up...At least he was consistent in those days. Now, he seems to be a fair weather originalist, abandoning that method's narrow constraints when it suits his ambition.\n\nHaving a foil like Cruz in class must have been frustrating. But Tribe's didn't produce any real evidence to support his claim that Cruz-style \"originalism\" would bar him from the presidency. Trump himself has now dropped Tribe's name in public appearances and debates to legitimize his own hollow assertions. And Tribe is not the only prominent academic who treated the Cruz birther issue seriously. As a result, now that Trump is zeroing in on Rubio, he can wield these academic dalliances with the Cruz claim to cloud the mendacity of his new claim. It's not coincidental that the targets of these birther libels are the first African American president and the first two credible Latino presidential candidates. Trump has also endorsed the indefensible claim that American-born children of undocumented aliens are not covered by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. The Rubio libel now extends that claim to include lawful aliens. The Constitution is clear; but enough mud can obscure any truth -- and it's flying now.\n\nIn much of the public mind, American citizenship is being redefined into a matter of race and blood, apparently as part of the nostalgia for an imagined golden era of racial, religious, and sexual exclusion. Worse, people who know better seem to be unable to resist playing the roles Trump assigns them in his sinister charade. Television hosts like Joe Scarborough and Mika Brezinzki embrace Trump with toothless questions, and Republican Party leaders are slowly capitulating to him as their party's nominee. But academics should resist Trump's knowledge corruption, whether it's about climate change or the Constitution.\n\nHistory will not be kind to those who should be the keepers of our ideals, but who instead are turning into rhinoceroses before the public's eyes.", "House Speaker L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r inaugurated a memorial plaque in Parliament honouring the victims of Communist rule under the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. The plaque pays tribute to the roughly 500 people who were held captive and tortured in the Parliament building by the regime. The press at the time knew that not all who were held captive survived, however, the only body ever found and identified was that of Andr\u00e1s Incseli Sz\u0151ts. The memorial plaque was placed near the area where Incseli Sz\u0151ts's body was found on June 26, 1919.\n\nThe Socialist Party issued a statement to pay tribute to all victims of totalitarian regimes in the 20th century. In their statement, the Socialists said it was a national responsibility to call attention to the hazards jeopardising\n\ndemocracy as well as to step up against dictatorial traits. Harassing anyone because of their ethnicity, religion, or political affiliation is unacceptable, the statement said, adding that the Socialists are committed to building a society which is able to suppress totalitarian policies.", "Investigations into recent terrorist attacks, such as those in Paris and Jakarta, led to reports of extremist groups using encrypted cell phone apps, such as Telegram, to avoid government surveillance. This has fuelled further calls from government officials and security agencies worldwide for stricter regulations to monitor Internet users and the use of encryption.\n\nIn a statement to the United States (US) Senate, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey said that the use of encryption had allowed for terrorists to 'go dark' and that 'changing forms of Internet communication and the use of encryption are posing real challenges to the FBI's ability to fulfil its public safety and national security missions.'\n\nA recent court order by the FBI, which compels Apple to help unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, reflects the core of these debates. Where is the line between giving security agencies enough power to do their jobs, and limiting that power so that privacy rights are protected?\n\nThe delicate balancing act between public safety and privacy presents the international community with an unavoidable practical and political challenge.\n\nJulian Assange, founder of the whistle-blower website, Wikileaks, has equated the battle for encryption to the right to bear arms. The drafters of the US Constitution included the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment on the premise that it would provide citizens with the means to defend themselves against a totalitarian government and ultimately, ensure their freedom.\n\nPrivacy activists such as Assange and Edward Snowden see encryption and Internet privacy in the same light. Without privacy, there can be no freedom of speech, and without freedom of speech, states cannot be held accountable for the power they exercise in maintaining security.\n\nIn 2011, two years before the Snowden revelations, the Arab Spring showed the world how powerful the Internet can be in influencing politics. Using resources like the Tor network - a web browser created by the US Naval Research Laboratory, which uses encryption and hides the identity and location of the user - journalists and activists could circumvent the surveillance of authoritarian governments seeking to stifle free speech.\n\nThis technology allowed for the safe online sharing of information and organisation of protests. In response, states like Egypt, Libya and Syria, went as far as to 'turn off' the Internet in their countries. The ability to use the Internet anonymously had become a 'weapon' in the fight for liberation.\n\nEncryption and the ability to use the Internet without being tracked is becoming an increasingly necessary tool for journalists and activists across the world.\n\nIn Africa, government accountability and democratic values such as free speech are already often found lacking, and massive-scale government surveillance is a frightening prospect.\n\nIn 2011, Facebook discovered that the Tunisian government had been using malicious code to steal the Facebook passwords of its citizens to delete the accounts of users who had shared 'undesirable' material. Bloggers and activists had started using Facebook as a means to upload and share videos - such as footage of police brutality - after all other video-sharing websites had been blocked.\n\nHassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director, explains the dilemma in the context of the Egyptian government's revamped surveillance programme. 'The Egyptian authorities have an abysmal track record when it comes to respecting the right to freedom of expression, association and assembly. A system to conduct indiscriminate surveillance of social media on a mass scale risks becoming yet another instrument in the Egyptian government's toolbox of state repression.'\n\nActivist groups are often targeted as well. The Free Tibet movement, for example, has often come under attack from suspected Chinese government hackers. This is no surprise considering China's history of suppressing free speech and monitoring its citizens.\n\nA new social tool called Sesame Credit, introduced by the financial arm of the Alibaba group - China's online commerce giant - shows the extent to which surveillance can come to dominate our lives. The programme determines an individual's credit score based on their online activity. So-called 'dissident activity' - like voicing anti-government opinions or discussing forbidden subjects, such as the Tiananmen Square tragedy or the Shanghai market crash - lower an individual's credit score. Simply being online friends with 'dissident' individuals could also lower an individual's credit score. Sesame Credit ratings are currently optional, but the Chinese government hopes to have a similar system implemented nationwide by 2020.\n\nIn a world where our lifestyles are increasingly intertwined with online technology, this level of surveillance is a few small steps away from being all-encompassing.\n\nMichael Hayden, a former director of the US government's National Security Agency, once said, '... to be effective, [the] NSA really needs to be only two things - powerful and secret.' These qualities are precisely what democracy is intended to guard against, even in the name of security.\n\nThe big question is whether widespread and indiscriminate Internet and communications surveillance is as necessary for public security as government agencies would have us believe. At the recent World Economic Forum, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, said that wide-scale surveillance, instead of targeted counter-terrorism efforts, did little to fend off terror attacks. De Croo, who oversees the state's telecommunication's industry, said: 'All of the people that were involved in the [Paris] terrorist attacks, all of them were on lists. And they were on lists because they visited certain mosques that we were looking at.'\n\nIf traditional measures were being utilised more successfully, mass surveillance could become excessive. Another key question is whether we would be willing to give up more of our privacy in exchange for the sense of security that mass surveillance may offer.\n\nOur security as individuals is significantly tied to our ability to hold governments to account - and free speech remains the cornerstone of this endeavour. In the digital age, securing freedom of speech means securing the ability of citizens to use electronic communications without fear. Subjecting citizens to surveillance restrains all of us; not just the minority that intends to cause harm.", "By Mathew Maavak, a doctoral researcher in security foresight at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich observed: \"Asia begins at the Landstrasse.\" Nations east of this Viennese street were already exhibiting parochial undercurrents that were contrarian to Western thought. This fault-line remains with modified contours, exacerbated by the trifecta of EU failures in its immigration, economic and foreign policies.\n\nEastern Europe refuses to drown with its Western half in the cesspit of totalitarian multiculturalism, and will inevitably gravitate towards Greater Eurasia.\n\nSamuel P. Huntington's \"civilizational\" treatise seems flawed as it emphasized religion over identity. In reality, the tectonic plates of extant civilizations rarely grate with seismic effects.\n\nCivilizations and their characteristics\n\nExtant civilizations have unique characteristics. They are inheritors of identities forged in situ since ancient times. They are led by nation-states or \"civilization-states\" that quietly cooperate, not clash, in post-modern times of peril.\n\nIn terms of longevity, Greater Eurasia's civilization-states include China and India (5,000-years-old), Iran and Israel (4,000 years), Japan (3,000 years) and Russia (1,000 years). All other nations within Greater Eurasia are adjuncts, bridges or melting pots created by some of these ancient states. Japan and Israel however are standalone civilizations, with the latter having suffered a two-millennium gap in its existence.\n\nCivilizations welcome globalization but counterbalance it with sovereignty. The New World Order may be stamped on the US dollar and enthused by the West, but it remains a civilizational anathema and a global pipedream.\n\nSo, while the EU - a political construct - slowly disintegrates, Greater Eurasia continues to build. China and Iran recently revived their ancient Silk Road links via a new rail network on Feb 15. India and China are increasing cooperation despite unresolved border issues. Russia, China and India are subtly bridging the antagonistic chasm between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe geographic swath from Iran to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Israel may in fact constitute the future south-western flank of Greater Eurasia. It might take 5, 10 or 20 years, suffer one setback or another, but it may happen. All these nations are either multi-ethnic or have large constituents of ancient minorities living within their borders. For the time being, both Iran and Israel have little choice but to neutralize the so-called Islamic State that is inimical to all identities except its own. Using the civilizational paradigm here, Israel will only war with Iran if Tel Aviv continues to be a political vassal of the Greater Eurabian enterprise.\n\nThere is a growing corpus of literature on Greater Eurasia but what of Greater Eurabia? Geographically, it begins at the gates of the Sunni bastions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and includes the entire Western world on the wrong side of the Landstrasse. Afghanistan and Pakistan (AfPak) are effectively adjuncts of Greater Eurabia while Turkey, with its pan-Turkic dreams stretching all the way to Xinjiang, can count itself as a founding member.\n\nThe 'Abode of War'\n\nGreater Eurabia has no extant civilization-states. It has two power-axes wielded in Washington and Riyadh, reflecting US neo-conservatism and Wahhabi medievalism. Pundits simplify the West-Gulf Arab security alliance as one underpinned by oil and petrodollars. However, there is more to this, in term of shared core values. Think of the 200 mosques that Saudi Arabia callously offered to build when Germany begged it to accommodate refugees who were dislodged by Riyadh's religious wars? Germany is allowed to lord over Europe as long as it reflects Washington's interests.\n\nGreater Eurabia functions on a rigid pecking order, where the poor get poorer and the 1 percent gets richer. Yet, no other alliance gets frothy over \"peace\" or \"international law,\" but thrives on war or terror. It groups itself either under inflexible ideology (i.e. EU and NATO) or inflexible religion (i.e. GCC core of the Sunni Crescent).\n\nBoth axes have their own irreconcilable visions of a borderless world. One is marked by \"free markets,\" \"freedom\" and \"free what-nots\" while the other longs for a reincarnated Caliphate. Wars are waged, and revolutions fomented, for these ideals. While these antithetical visions ironically clash in the West, they synergize at confluences like Syria, creating illegitimate offspring like the so-called Islamic State or Daesh.\n\nDaesh, ironically, amplifies the core values both axes were founded on, namely that of genocide and slavery. The United States and the Arab world were undeniably forged by ethnoreligious cleansing and slave labour. To mask their dark provenances and inject delusions of grandeur and divine destiny into their brainwashed subjects, both axes resort to an ever morphing narrative replete with new bogeymen. Daesh exemplifies this fluid rebranding, with itself having metamorphosed from \"moderate rebels\" to the \"Free Syrian Army\" to ISIL, ISIS, the Islamic State and finally the neutral-sounding Daesh in the mainstream Western media.\n\nWestern journalism, like its history, favors inversions of reality that are regularly re-cast in stone as facts. This is best exemplified by its Eurabian half's paradoxical worldview of more peaceful lands as the Dar-ul-Harb or \"Abode of War.\" The Arab world never sees itself or its Western allies as the embodiment of that term. But then Greater Eurabia is like a juvenile delinquent who refuses to grow up or introspect. It is always the bogeyman's fault. Europe's refugee crisis is conveniently pinned on Russia while China takes the blame for the ongoing global economic slowdown.\n\nEuropeans, unable to defend their women and children from physical violations in the hands of incoming refugees, still antagonize Russia over Crimea. Americans, who can hardly protect their children from everyday violence, spree shootings and mass-mediated sexualisation, have developed this paroxysmal itch to save Southeast Asians from a supposed \"Chinese aggression\" in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the final analysis, Greater Eurabia will crash under the weight of its contradictions. Apart from shared destructive values, both axes mutually repel each other in all other areas. They do not even answer nature's call the same way. When Germany introduced bidet toilets for its immigrant hordes, the move was couched in universal terms. Creators of this civilizational innovation, Global Fliegenschmidt, branded it as \"Universally applicable: the refugee toilet is ideal for the globalised defecation.\"\n\n\"Globalized defecation\" is coincidentally the perfect metaphor and destiny of Greater Eurabia.", "JNS.org - In his preface to a recent publication from Fathom, a British magazine covering the Middle East, British lawyer and antisemitism expert Anthony Julius -- always the author of a memorable phrase -- denounced \"anti-Zionism and its creature, the BDS movement,\" as \"one of the major political stupidities of our time.\"\n\nThe import of Julius's comment struck me as I was reflecting on the terrible fate of Ilan Halimi, the young French Jew who 10 years ago was kidnapped for ransom by a largely Muslim gang. Halimi spent nearly a month in the custody of these \"barbarians\" -- that was what they called themselves -- during which time they beat him, burned him and tortured him. Halimi was left for dead by a railway track outside Paris on Feb. 13, 2006, and indeed, he did die of his wounds just a few hours after being discovered.\n\nIn the tumult that followed the murder, it emerged that Youssef Fofana, the gang leader, had targeted Halimi because he was a Jew, and Jews have money. It was a brutal demonstration to a skeptical French public that antisemitism within the Muslim community -- often fueled by savage attacks on Israel's right to exist and dark mutterings about the political influence of its Jewish supporters -- is all too real.\n\nSpeaking at the recent 10th anniversary commemorating Halimi's murder, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazneuve confessed, \"Ten years after the murder we still feel this collective regret of hesitating to call the act by its true name -- antisemitic hate.''\n\nThat hate is also, as Anthony Julius might acknowledge, a monstrous form of political stupidity. Despite being one of the discredited ideologies that grounded totalitarianism in the last century, antisemitism has persisted into this one. Its followers have regrouped under the banner of the elimination not just of Israel, but of the empathy and affiliation with Israel that most Diaspora Jews feel towards it.\n\nThis onslaught upon Jewish empowerment and self-confidence has more than one symbol. At its depths, it is exemplified by the extraordinary cruelty Ilan Halimi was subjected to, solely because he was a Jew. In that regard, you might also include the murderous siege at a kosher supermarket in Paris last year, at the close of a week that began with an Islamist terror attack against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.\n\nAt its \"height\" -- and I use that word with reservation -- it takes the form of either rationalizing antisemitism or denying that it exists altogether. Instead of understanding the Halimi murder as an act of hatred aimed at the Jewish people, some French intellectuals advise us that the \"sentiment that a large section of black and Arab French youth feel towards the Jews is something quite different, having nothing in common with historic antisemitism.\"\n\nThe authors of that claim, Messrs. Alain Badiou, Eric Hazan, and Ivan Segre, then explain that it's all Israel's fault: \"The young people we are referring to make an amalgam between the Israeli state's anti-Palestinian repression and this distorted image of French Jews, which can lead them to believe all the Jews in the world, here and elsewhere, are their enemies.\"\n\nIt is distasteful to think of Ilan Halimi's torment as an \"amalgam,\" but this kind of explanation isn't limited to these writers. Similar arguments have been made following other atrocities against European Jews, such as the murder of a teacher and three children at a Jewish school in Toulouse in 2012, and the 2014 attack on the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, in which four people were killed.\n\nAgain, the pattern in these attacks is the same: the perpetrators were local Muslims (although it should be clarified that no foreign Islamist organization was involved in the Halimi murder) and the rationalizers were the same folks who portray BDS (the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement) as a legitimate, non-violent cause. The net effect of both reinforces, quite simply, the sense that whether they are outside or inside Israel, Jews are overprivileged interlopers with malign and disproportionate influence. In other words, exactly the same political stupidity that prevailed in the darkest days of the 20th century.\n\nOf course, anti-Zionism is unlikely to trigger another mass extermination of the Jews, but that's a miserable standard to live by. Right now, it is the main contributor to the insecurity that European Jews too frequently encounter. Paradoxically, legal measures against the hate speech practiced by BDS supporters may lead some of its wilder followers to pursue further violence targeting Jews in frustration at the blunting of their campaign against Israel.", "Bishkek (AKIpress) - Representatives of several non-governmental organizations in their open letter to the President and the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan have asked to reject the bill on foreign agents.\n\nThey reminded that the bill on foreign agents, which was authored by MP Tursunbai Bakit Uulu, MP Nurkamil Madaliyev, MP Nadira Narmatova, was passed by the previous parliament on June 4, 2015, in the first reading.

This excerpt -- from \"Complaints about NSA Spying Are Schizophrenic ... and Misguided,\" June 8, 2013 -- is illustrative.\n\n__________________\n\nAmericans complaining about the government spying on them is rather like Kim Kardashian complaining about the paparazzi taking pictures of her...\n\nIn this Information Age, tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, and WikiLeaks are masters of the universe. But they have created a schizophrenic human species -- whose members share everything about everything, yet claim to be zealous about their privacy.\n\nOnly this explains the growing national outrage over the government's National Security Agency (NSA) monitoring their promiscuous and indiscriminate digital footprints. But there's no explaining why these nincompoops think it's okay for tech companies to spy on them to sell them stuff, but not okay for the NSA to do so to keep them safe.\n\nNot to mention how they blithely give up truly sensitive personal information for the convenience of buying stuff with credit cards. After all, records collected from such transactions make the generic phone records the NSA collects seem even less intrusive than a traffic cop's speed gun.\n\nBut all we need is for terrorists to pull off another 9/11. For the same people venting outrage about government surveillance today will be venting even greater outrage over the government's failure to monitor the footprints of those terrorists (i.e., connecting the dots).\n\n__________________\n\nExcept that it's one thing for tech companies to exploit the ignorance of their customers to sell them stuff. It's quite another for them to defy a court order to help the government keep their customers safe.\n\nYet this is the incomprehensible and untenable defiance Apple is mounting today as if its corporate life depends on it.\n\nThe US Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple Inc. to comply with a judge's order to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant's refusal as a 'marketing strategy...'\n\nThe Justice Department said its Friday motion was a response to Apple CEO Tim Cook's public statement Wednesday, which included a refusal to 'hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.'\n\n'Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ... Apple has responded by publicly repudiating that order,' prosecutors wrote in the Friday filing.\n\n(Reuters, February 19, 2016)\n\nUnsurprisingly, other tech companies are supporting Apple; its defiance furthers their commercial interests. But it is utterly stupefying that ordinary folks are doing so too. After all, judges routinely sign warrants which force us to open our homes for all kinds of searches and seizes. They sign similar warrants to force us to even give hair and blood samples.\n\nTherefore, Apple must believe its customers' iPhones are more inviolate than their homes, even their bodies. Only this belief explains its defiance. Never mind the schizophrenic premise upon which it is based; namely, that people who use iPhones to share everything about their private lives want Apple to protect their privacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple's compliance with the Chinese government makes a mockery of its defiance against the American government. Not least because this betrays the fact that Apple is all too willing to sacrifice customer privacy for corporate profit:\n\nDetractors of Apple's decision to refuse to hack an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters for the FBI have questioned why, if the company feels it must protect 'the security of its customers' it apparently complied with the Chinese government's demand to show it secret data one year ago.\n\nIn January last year Quartz reported that according to Chinese news agencies, Apple agreed to let the Chinese government perform 'security checks' to confirm that there were no 'backdoors' that might let the U.S. government read Chinese citizens' data. The country had threatened Apple's access to the Chinese market.\n\n(London Daily Mail, February 20, 2016)\n\nAnd if you believe the Chinese government used Apple to protect the privacy of its citizens, your naivet\u00e9 is matched only by Apple's hypocrisy.\n\nAs it happens, though, Apple merely did what other tech companies had done.

They wish to remind the nation of the remarks made on October 23rd of 1970, by Cecil Wallace Whitfield who stood up at a PLP convention and spoke against the disturbing reality that the PLP had lost its way. He highlighted the \"creeping totalitarianism\" within the party and the fact that young people at the time had no real say in the direction of their country. Unfortunately not much has changed.The Torchbearers Youth Association (TYA) was formed on September 1st 1972 and was the first youth arm of any political party in The Bahamas. This is a clear indication that from its inception, the Free National Movement has always appreciated the fact that the youth are an integral part of any successful organization. Several past TYA executives have gone on to become Cabinet Ministers.\n\nOn February 24, 2016, in keeping with the Party's constitution and mandate, the Torchbearers Youth Association held its biennial election. Re-elected President, Ronique Brown, noted, \"I am pleased to report that the process was fair, orderly and in the end respectful.\" She further encouraged all members that they are \"invaluable assets to the Association and I look forward to working with each and every one of them.\" Dynamic speaker and organizer Anwar McCartney, while unsuccessful in vying for the Presidency was gracious in congratulating the President and pledging to support the work of TYA.Richard Johnson the outgoing 3rd Vice President remarked how please he was that the process was transparent and balanced and that his commitment to unseating the PLP will not change one bit.\n\nThe newly elected board has already given themselves a mandate. 1st Vice President Carlyle Bethel passionately expressed that \"The easy part is over!

It is now time to help our party develop policies and programs to ensure that the youth of our country are never marginalized and no longer disenfranchised.\"\n\nThe newly elected 3rd Vice President Lamont Nesbitt, a native of South Andros briefly outlined a few goals for this executive team, which includes civic engagement, political engagement, youth development and entrepreneurship and economic empowerment.The executive board will be looking to increase its presence in the various constituencies throughout The Bahamas according to President Ronique Brown who stated, \"we look forward to doing our part in bringing about a new and better Bahamas for this generation and generations to come.\"\n\nParty Chairman Senator Michael Pintard cautioned TYA members to make their celebration short, embrace each other and commit to working relentlessly to replace a PLP that knows how to win but not how to govern.", "On a rainy day in April 1990, I journeyed to the outskirts of Warsaw to one of those functional Communist-era apartment building complexes to meet with Antoni Macierewicz. The opposition leader's apartment contrasted sharply with its grim institutional surroundings. It was an aristocratic enclave full of books, antiques, and prints on the wall. Macierewicz himself exuded an Old World kind of charm that Polish intellectuals worked so hard to preserve during difficult times.\n\nA long-time dissident, Macierewicz had been something of a leftist in the 1970s, supporting the Revolutionary Left Movement in Chile and protesting the U.S. war in Vietnam. He was a key figure, with Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik, in the creation of the Committee for the Defense of Workers (KOR) in 1976 and then Solidarity in 1980.\n\nOver the years, however, he'd moved steadily rightward until he'd become, by 1990, a leading figure in a coalition of conservative Christian groups. These groups had cooperated with Solidarity during the 1980s. But now that Poland had put the Communist era behind it, Macierewicz was staking out a distinct political terrain for his version of clerical anti-Communism.\n\nGovernment policy, he told me that afternoon in 1990, should follow Church teachings, and so should instruction in public schools. The economic reforms that Poland was then undertaking were not, he argued, sufficiently anti-state, for they did not guarantee access to capital and ownership to the largest number of Poles. And the new Polish state, stripped down to its minimal functions, should make a clean break with the past to eliminate any lingering influence from former Communist functionaries.\n\nPerhaps naively, I didn't see much of a future for Macierewicz and his Catholic nationalists. The last thing I imagined Poles wanted after 1989 was to swap one variety of political intolerance for another. Poles were overwhelmingly Catholic, of course. But church attendance was far from universal -- 53 percent in 1987 -- and religious zealotry was a distinctly minority passion.\n\nMeanwhile, most Polish voters were gravitating toward the middle of the political spectrum. Solidarity politicians were establishing a set of center-right parties, and the former Communists were struggling to rebrand themselves as a center-left party (though \"left\" and \"right\" meant something quite different in terms of actual policies in Poland at that time). And indeed, in the next parliamentary elections in 1991, Macierewicz's forces in Catholic Election Action managed a mere 8.7 percent of the vote for the Sejm (though the coalition captured a bit more, 17.4 percent, for the Senate).\n\nBut Macierewicz himself vaulted into the position of minister of internal affairs in 1991. The following year he released the infamous Macierewicz List, which identified 64 members of the Polish government and parliament as former secret Communist agents. Even more controversially, he accused then-president Lech Walesa of also being an informer.\n\nThese claims produced immediate outrage -- from those who believed that the government was unacceptably compromised as well as those who were appalled that such unvetted accusations were made public. A successful no-confidence vote in parliament led to the resignation of the government and the abrupt end of Macierewicz's term in office. A subsequent parliamentary inquiry concluded that only six of the 64 had signed any agreements with the secret police, and Macierewicz also had to face charges of publishing state secrets.\n\nMacierewicz had established a reputation as Poland's Ted Cruz -- a firebrand willing to take down his political opponents even at the cost of his own position.\n\nBut it gets worse than that.\n\nMacierewicz never met a conspiracy theory he didn't like. In the 2000s, he was still convinced that a majority of Polish diplomats were former Communist informers, earning him a skeptical appraisal in a U.S. diplomatic cable. He believed that the Russians were behind the 2010 airplane crash in Smolensk that killed then-Polish President Lech Kaczynski and many other prominent Poles on their way to a commemoration of the Katyn massacre. And, in an infamous interview with the right-wing Catholic Radio Maryja, he put in a good word for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, adding that \"Polish experience, especially in recent years, shows that there are such groups in Jewish circles who think in a cunning way and act deliberately to the detriment of, for example, Poland.\"\n\nIt would be nice to report that Macierewicz remains at the fringes of Polish politics, that his past actions and rhetoric have disqualified him from serving in high positions. But that would be wishful thinking.\n\nAs of last December, Antoni Macierewicz is Poland's minister of defense.\n\nPoland is frequently held up as the success story of Central Europe's transition from Communism. It has experienced relatively steady economic growth, even during the financial crisis of 2007-8. It has implemented a successful political decentralization plan. It continues to boast a thriving civil society.\n\nBut in the parliamentary elections last year, the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) capitalized on widespread resentment and anger not only to come in first, but also to secure the country's first parliamentary majority in the democratic era. As with the victory of Viktor Orban's right-wing Fidesz party in Hungary, PiS has set about to transform the country into what Orban has famously called an \"illiberal democracy.\"\n\nThe appointment of Macierewicz as defense minister is only the tip of the spear. Poland expert David Ost, writing in The Nation, argues that Poland's PiS is pursuing\n\nan uncompromising revolution from above that abandons the institutions of liberal democracy and any ethos of compromise in favor of an unchallenged monopoly of power. The new authorities call for a \"strong\" state instead of a \"lawful\" state, to be guided by \"Polish values\" and \"Christian traditions,\" deeply hostile to any political opposition, and imagining itself in a historic battle with a Europe committed to \"totalitarian\" ideas like gender equality and resettling refugees.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the twin brother of Lech who died in the Smolensk air disaster, is the force behind PiS. He has remained in parliament to control the party while elevating the more diplomatic Beata Szydlo as prime minister and getting his attack dog, the Cruz-like Macierewicz, appointed as defense minister. Together, they are presiding over a transformation in Poland not unlike what the Tea Party would dearly like to accomplish in the United States.\n\nLet's begin with Macierewicz and his obsessions. As an opposition politician, Macierewicz refused to accept the official version of the Smolensk air disaster, holding hearings in parliament that featured \"experts\" who relied on Internet photos rather than site visits. Macierewicz rejected the notion that some combination of fog and pilot error caused the Tupolev 154 plane to crash, the conclusion of the official investigations of both Poland and Russia. Instead, like something out of House of Cards or Madame Secretary, he has insisted that an explosion caused the crash and the Russians were behind it.\n\nMacierewicz's determination to reopen an official inquiry into Smolensk is sure to aggravate the already dicey relations between Moscow and Warsaw. As importantly, it will polarize what is already a deeply divided Polish society. \"Smolensk\" has all the hallmarks of the \"birther\" movement in which facts count for a lot less than insinuation. Just as only one-third of Republican voters believe that President Obama was born in the United States, nearly one-third of Poles believe that Lech Kaczynski was assassinated. The Russians are not the only evil-doers in this drama. If the official Polish inquiry was flawed, the previous government of Donald Tusk and the Civic Platform (PO) -- the chief political opposition to PiS -- emerge as dangerous co-conspirators.\n\nThe enemy within is the real focus of Poland's Tea Party. For instance, Macierewicz has undertaken a purge of the military as if it were populated by Communist-era appointees rather than officials designated by the previous center-right government. The purge included the rector of the National Defense University. The new government even went so far as to conduct a raid on NATO's Counter-Intelligence Center of Excellence, which is based in Warsaw, to replace its head. This is how coup leaders, not democratically elected governments, go about the business of cleaning house.\n\nOn military issues more generally, Macierewicz wants to nearly double the size of the Polish army, and he'd trade participation in the coalition bombings in Syria for the stationing of NATO units in Poland. If the reopening of the Smolensk inquiry doesn't deepsix relations with Moscow, this buildup on Poland's eastern borders will do the trick. After seething over various official efforts over the last couple decades to repair relations with Russia, Macierewicz is after nothing less than a revival of the age-old hostility between the two countries.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the politics of revenge in Central Europe were clear-cut. The new political elite took aim at the former Communists, lustrating them out of government, stripping the party of its assets, and throwing a couple of the top leaders in jail (or attempting to). But as opposition coalitions fragmented into a kaleidoscope of parties, the politics of revenge in the region became increasingly complicated.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski and PiS have broadened their campaign of revenge far beyond Communism. They have scores to settle with former allies as well.\n\nTake, for instance, the campaign against Lech Walesa. The august Polish leader has always been firmly on the right side of the political spectrum. But he and the Kaczynski brothers crossed swords in the 1990s. It's no surprise, then, that new charges of Walesa as a Communist collaborator surfaced just this month. Kaczynski and company maintain that the Solidarity movement unnecessarily compromised with the Communist Party during the transition period -- keeping General Wojciech Jaruzelski as president rather than throwing him in prison, for instance, and allowing the nomenklatura to cash in on the new capitalist economy. Walesa's collaboration in the 1970s is supposed to represent the fatal flaw of the accommodationist wing of Solidarity.\n\nThe historical revisionism of PiS is part of what the Germans call kulturkampf, or cultural struggle. Their goal is to \"purify\" the country of Poles of the \"worst sort,\" as Kaczynski has described his opponents.\n\nIn uglier days, the \"worst sort\" of Poles might have been Jews, who were accused of being Communists or rapacious capitalists or simply disloyal \"outsiders.\" Today, the enemy is a motley collection of liberals, secularists, critical intellectuals, and cosmopolitans. Poland's Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski has warned against \"a new mixing of cultures and races, a world made up of bicyclists and vegetarians, who ... fight all forms of religion.\" With the Communist bogeyman gone, the best that PiS can come up with is bicyclists and vegetarians?\n\nTo combat these threats to Polish society, PiS began to ram through legislation in a top-down effort to remake Polish society. Like Fidesz in Hungary, PiS has first targeted the constitutional court, which represented an obstacle to its revolutionary program. PiS doesn't have a large enough parliamentary majority to easily change the Polish constitution. So it pursued two strategies -- to pack the court with its appointees and slow down its functioning by requiring two-thirds majority rulings rather than a simple majority as before.\n\nOther legislation has included a law giving the government greater surveillance powers as well as the authority to appoint the heads of public media. It's as if Viktor Orban and Fidesz have served as unofficial advisors because PiS is following virtually the same playbook. No surprise, then, that Kacyznski met with Orban for six hours in January. And five years ago, the Polish politician declared: \"Viktor Orban gave us an example of how we can win. The day will come when we will succeed, and we will have Budapest in Warsaw.\"\n\nThat day has come. And this time the European Union is reacting. Writes Jan-Werner Muller in The New York Review of Books:\n\nUnlike in the case of Hungary, the European Union has reacted quickly. Leading EU figures declared that fundamental democratic values were threatened by Warsaw. And on January 13, the European Commission was sufficiently concerned to open a \"probe\" into the workings of the rule of law in Poland, a step that is unprecedented in EU history.\n\nIt's not just Poland's internal politics that worries the EU. The Union has encountered considerable pushback from Central European countries, including Poland, about accepting their fair share of refugees coming from the Middle East. Poland, with a miniscule immigrant population, has also seen a large outflow of population over the last two decades. In other words, there's plenty of room for newcomers.\n\nBut Kaczynski has made clear that refugees are not welcome. \"There are already signs of emergence of diseases that are highly dangerous and have not been seen in Europe for a long time: cholera on the Greek islands, dysentery in Vienna,\" he said during the 2015 election campaign. \"There is also talk about other, even more severe diseases.\" This rhetoric echoes Nazi descriptions of Jews as carriers to disease. The more moderate of the anti-refugee politicians in Poland have, like Donald Trump, argued that only the Christians among the asylum-seekers should be allowed in.\n\nThe success of PiS is not simply a function of the failures of the previous center-right government of Donald Tusk, who decamped in late 2014 to become the president of the European Council. Rather, as in Hungary, the Kaczynski crowd has benefited from the collapse of the left in Poland.\n\nWhen it was in charge, the left embraced a pro-West platform of austerity economic reforms, accession to NATO and the EU, and a (relatively) tolerant set of cultural policies. The support for \"shock therapy\" cost the mainstream left its base among those who have not benefitted from economic reforms. This opened up a vast opportunity for right-wing parties that have fed on anger and resentment of the \"losers of transition\" -- farmers, industrial workers, pensioners -- by offering, like the Tea Party, vaguely populist economic policies.\n\nIn this Polish culture war, however, the \"worst sort\" of Poles are fighting back. Demonstrations have again become commonplace in Warsaw, and the liberal left is banding together in the face of the new threat.\n\nMacierewicz and the other Mad Hatters of the Polish \"Tea Party\" movement will no doubt do a lot of damage during their tenure in power. But perhaps, as in 1992, they will overreach and be overwhelmed by a backlash that will prove powerful enough, finally, to push Poland kicking and screaming into 21-century Europe.", "We are all more endangered than at any time in human history due to psychopathic influences at the apex of the political machine.\n\nThe GOP is dangerously rabid and the Left has moved so far to the right, it no longer exists. What passes for 'progressive' ideology today, equates to what would be considered semi-hardline conservatism 35 years ago.\n\nThe type of fascism that the U.S. right wing has created [actually re-created utilizing Nazi techniques] and normalized, has now gone global and we are witnessing a plethora of psychopathic personalities dominating positions of great power all over the planet.\n\nThis trend is making every living being in our world susceptible to a massive societal and ecological collapse which is well under way.\n\nThe deck is currently so stacked in favor of world totalitarianism -- for the first time in human history, driven by so-called Western 'democratic' nations, with the U.S. leading the pack -- that there is little remaining which embraces sanity, ethics or common sense; basic tools for maintaining the structure of a functioning society. The bar for decent, responsible human behavior has been set so low by our 'leaders' that it now resides in a trench.\n\nHistorically during war, there was always somewhere to escape to for individuals who could see the writing on the wall and had the means and connections to flee.\n\nWhere does one run when victimized by an eternal global war? By wars which will only escalate given the real reason behind them -- personal greed and an unquenchable lust for power. Trillions of dollars are being made [and stolen] by each cog in the machine of 'The War on Terror'. A war which was initially fabricated and eventually made real by the profiteers and power brokers who perpetually stand to gain the most. And more are joining this legion of blood soaked psychopaths every day. It is for this reason that we can all expect continual war stretching into infinity; with unending technological horrors and manufactured plots invented to keep advancing the agenda of killing, chaos, militarization and obscene profits.\n\nIn the U.S. we've had psychopaths and morons at the helm before. Their influence somewhat tempered by others on the periphery with more rational thinking and common sense. Those people of conscience have all been purged by design and only the brains of festering lunatics remain at the top. Bat shit crazy has gone mainstream. Sanity has been replaced by amoral, mentally disturbed individuals with no real grasp of the consequences of their irrational actions; a proliferation of macho swagger and itchy trigger fingers make the likelihood of nuclear conflict one in which it becomes a matter of when, not if.\n\nThese psychopaths and idiots have been elevated to hero status. It appears that the more violent, aggressive, outrageous, compassionless and dim-witted an individual is in our society, the better the chance s/he will see their power and popularity skyrocket. The march toward madness appears not only acceptable to the throngs, but inevitable.\n\nWe are in more danger as a species than at any time in our existence. People are not just dumbed down, they're unconscious and surrounded by a deadly cloud of delusion. Critical thinking has ceased to exist for the majority. It has been replaced by a type of communicable dementia which is spreading with pandemic efficiency.\n\nWho in their right mind willingly supports a criminal political machine [referring to both Republicans and right-wing Democrats] which is hell-bent on destroying women, children, seniors, the physically and mentally challenged, gays, ethnic and gender minorities, and annihilating our environment? Even the Mafia takes better care of their families than this corrupt, evil monstrosity.\n\nIt is truly disgusting to see women leading the assault on the basic rights of other women as they support the rampant misogyny of male politicians. And quite bizarre to try and understand how any black man or woman would join those who have historically denied them every right imaginable. The level of self-loathing must be astronomical for gays embracing a right wing ideology which is equivalent to handing a gun to your attacker to finish you off. These types of enablers, working against their own best interests, embody a peculiar type of mental illness, and their numbers appear to have grown into a majority voice.\n\nWe should be enraged when so many have-nots defend a capitalistic system rigged by the country's elite, to strip them of the basic right to live without groveling. These poor souls actually believe they will have a chance at the American Dream. Most don't seem to understand that the 1% didn't earn their money, but inherited it -- and continue to rig the system to make it easier to keep that money by stealing it from the middle class and poor. Granted there are real success stories out there, but in reality, most people will work their fingers to the bone and die before achieving such opulence.\n\nWe have been programmed to defend and protect those who are responsible for enslaving us. Led around by the double digit IQ's of nit-wits who vehemently reject truth and make no apologies for a constant barrage of outrageous lies concocted to further their nefarious agendas.\n\nFed by cronyism at the top, leadership roles and positions of power are doled out according to monied and political connections. Usually going to the most brain dead, irrational, corrupt individuals possible. People who have no background, training or skills -- not even a basic knowledge of the positions they fill.\n\nThe Right's propaganda machine has been wildly successful with smearing any system which offers a shred of real equality to the masses. They effectively prey on the ignorance of Americans to keep them paying homage to the same people who are killing them.\n\nDemocratic Socialism has been in place within Scandinavian countries for several decades and has a track record for having the highest standard of living in the world for ALL of its citizens -- not just the privileged few. Yet it continues to be publicly maligned in the U.S. corporate-controlled media as 'communism' and 'fascism.' Buzz words which the elites know will strike terror in the hearts of the uninformed.

Roy was a courageous man whose memory we should cherish, says DW's Grahame Lucas.\n\nThe Mukto-Mona Internet platform was the first forum to be set up in Bangladesh to enable intellectuals to freely discuss their ideas about secularism, atheism, science and religion.\n\nIt was and is a unique project. Roy considered it to be a vital contribution to creating free societies in a region characterized by growing intolerance.\n\nHe also believed it should be a place where the folly of extremist religious dogma could be exposed. In a 2007 interview, Roy summed up his goals: \"Our aim is to build a society which will not be bound by the dictates of arbitrary authority, comfortable superstition, stifling tradition, or suffocating orthodoxy but would rather be based on reason, compassion, humanity, equality and science.\"\n\nHe was born to a Hindu family, a minority religious grouping in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, which suffers from discrimination to this day. Roy's vision of freedom of thought was the logical product of an intellectual journey which had begun in Bangladesh and had led him to the roots of Bengali traditions in India.\n\nAn outright challenge\n\nAs a student Roy became fascinated by the writings of the great Indian humanist author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, who in 1913 had become the first non-European writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nTagore's work appears to have influenced Roy deeply and convinced him of the importance of applying scientific principles to intellectual debate geared to the search for truth. Later, he also came under the influence of the American philosopher and atheist Paul Kurtz.\n\nRoy's intellectual journey led him to conclude that religious beliefs should not be used to reduce the freedom of others. This was an outright challenge to the totalitarianism inherent in the teachings of Islamist advocates of a theocratic state in Bangladesh ruled under Sharia law.\n\nRoy did not believe in pulling punches: \"If one insists that the verses of scriptures are literally word of Allah (God) who is omnipotent and omniscient then one is forced to conclude that Allah as perfect being is even a worse science writer than humans ... \".\n\nAccording to those who take the Quran literally, criticism of Islam is blasphemy and is punishable by death. Therefore Roy, who had gone to live in the US in 2006, was soon a target for death threats.\n\nIn the following years, the political situation in Bangladesh deteriorated dramatically. In 2013, the so-called International War Crimes Tribunal - set up by the government in 2010 to prosecute people accused of committing atrocities during the 1971 War of Independence - started to pass death sentences on leading Islamist politicians.\n\nBloggers under threat\n\nThis triggered the brutal murder of Roy's fellow blogger Rajib Haider, a contributor to Mukto-Mona. Islamist extremists published a hit list on the Internet containing the names of 84 bloggers they intended to murder. It included Roy's name. Tensions in Bangladesh were exacerbated still further in early 2014 by the re-election of the Awami League government after the political opposition had boycotted the polls.\n\nFarid Ahmed, Roy's co-editor at Mukto-Mona, recounted in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, how when Roy was planning to return to Bangladesh in February 2015 to visit his elderly mother he was warned how great the threat to his life had become: \"He didn't listen. He said 'I'll go quietly.'\"\n\n\"The only mistake he made ... [was] he went to the book fair and signed autographs,\" Ahmed said.\n\nAnd on February 26, last year, while visiting the Ekushey Book Fair in Dhaka, Roy was hacked to death by machete-wielding Islamists. His wife was seriously wounded. He had paid for his courage with his life.\n\nIn the course of 2015, Islamists attacked and murdered three other bloggers and a publisher. The killings will not stop as the government has done nothing to protect the bloggers. It does not appear to recognize the vital contribution writers like Avijit Roy and his colleagues at Mukto-Mona have made to intellectual debate and awareness of democratic and secular principles in Bangladesh.\n\nPerhaps the government simply does not care. But one thing is certain: Avijit Roy will always have a place in the hearts of those who cherish the freedom of speech. Murder cannot triumph over ideas.", "Tomorrow morning, at the annual Apple meeting of shareholders in Cupertino, California, I will speak in favor of Proposal #7, \"Human Rights Review,\" a shareholder proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research.\n\n(To read it, go here and scroll to page 62).\n\nLast spring, Apple CEO Tim Cook penned an op-ed in the Washington Post in which he blasted religious freedom as having no place in our country. With no background in public policy or Constitutional scholarship, Mr. Cook used his poison pen to claim that religious freedom - a Constitutional right - should be trumped by his oppressive opinion. Speaking specifically about efforts in Indiana and Arkansas to pass religious freedom laws, Cook called this \"something very dangerous\" that \"would allow people to discriminate against their neighbors.\" That's a lie.\n\nThe federal government and 31 states have RFRAs and none of them legalize discrimination against anyone. The federal RFRA was co-authored by now-deceased liberal icon Ted Kennedy and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993. That law and similar state religious freedom laws simply set a high threshold if the government seeks to impinge upon someone's religious liberties. If the government crosses that line, the injured party can go to court and seek relief. That's it.\n\nMr. Cook distorted these commonsense laws to attack Americans of faith. In the words of esteemed law professor Richard Epstein, Cook and others have given these laws their \"broadest possible construction and then give a parade of horribles, none of which have ever occurred.\"\n\nAmerica has always given special consideration to those who cannot protect themselves in the political or legal process - what we call the discreet and insular minorities. Cook attacked them. I hope that Mr. Cook will reflect on his words - which carry a strong totalitarian bent.\n\nEveryone knows that Apple and other major American retailers would never discriminate against a gay customer. But Cook attacked the small fundamentalist Christian that may not want to be coerced by her government to partake in a marriage ceremony that contravenes her faith.\n\nWhile Cook bemoans religious freedom here in America, Apple operates in 17 nations where homosexuality is outlawed. In four of those countries, homosexual acts are punishable by death. Apple also supports opening business relations with Iran - a state sponsor of terrorism. Good luck getting a Hamas or Hezbollah baker to make a cake for a gay wedding.\n\nIf you are an Apple shareholder, please join me in supporting proposal #7 and send a message to Apple's leaders that we shareholders support religious freedom.", "Conservative commentator and speaker Ben Shapiro on Thursday spoke to an appreciative audience at California State-Los Angeles over a blaring fire alarm protesters rang to obstruct his speech and despite the front door to the auditorium being barricaded by a protest mob so audience members had to come in through a back door.\n\nA Twitchy post cut through the political spin to the protests against free speech and said, \"'The fascist Left': 'Bloviating jack -- es' try to silence Ben Shaprio at CSULA.\"\n\nThe Media Research Center reported, \"Right now, YAF students and staff are essentially being held hostage in the lecture hall where Ben Shapiro just spoke at CSULA by protesters who are blocking the exits. Police have told us they can no longer guarantee anyone's safety.\"\n\nShapiro, in a video posted by MRC, said audience members were having to be \"sneaked in\" through a back door because of anti-speech protesters congregating and blocking the main entrance.\n\n\"In 2016, you have to use the back door if you want to participate in free speech,\" Shapiro said. \"You get to block the front door if you're a member of the left.\"\n\nHe cited one of the school's own sociology professors, Robert Weide, who earlier in the week had called YAF students \"white supremacists\" and invited them to fight him.\n\nShapiro reported Weide had called campus security on students putting up posters about the event because, \"You wouldn't want posters microaggressing you.\"\n\nShapiro reported the professor wrote on a sign outside his office, \"'The best response to microaggression is macroaggression.' In other words, if I'm offended I get to take physical action against you. I get to be violent with you.\"\n\nHe continued, \"For those of you who don't speak 'Low-IQ' what professor Weide means the best response to hearing things you don't like is hurting people who say those things.\"\n\nWhen a protester pulled a fire alarm to try to disrupt his speech, Shapiro said, \"They're not going to stop us.\"\n\nSee a short video:\n\nThe disruptions and anti-speech threats developed at least in part, he said, because the school's president, William Covino, is a \"totalitarian\" who canceled the event \"that he had no right to cancel.\"\n\n\"He refuses to stand up for free speech.\"\n\nHe charged the protesters with \"thug tactics\" and accused the administration of glorifying the attempts to shut down free speech.\n\nOfficials at California State University-Los Angeles only a short time before the speech had blinked in the standoff over free speech, announcing they were allowing Shapiro to speak to a school group that had invited him to campus.\n\nThe announcement came only a short time before Shapiro's appearance at the invitation of the student group called Young Americans for Freedom.\n\nThey had arranged for Shapiro to speak about diversity.\n\nIn an unsigned statement released by the university's communications office, the school had said there had been \"emails and social media posts that caused concern for the campus community.\"\n\n\"Given threats and expressions of fear, President William A. Covino proposed a rescheduled event that would be civil and inclusive, and in which Mr. Shapiro and speakers with other viewpoints could offer their perspectives in an organized forum.\"\n\nBut Covino actually told the students he was rescheduling Shapiro's speech so that the university could add other speakers with different viewpoints, and then Covino abruptly canceled it completely, prompting officials with the Alliance Defending Freedom to blast the suppression of free speech.\n\nThey pointed out that there are no constitutional provisions to let school officials abruptly call something \"controversial,\" then charge high \"security\" fees and then shut down an event entirely.\n\nThe school backtracked with a statement from Covino, \"My decision was made in the interest of safety and security. I am disappointed that Mr. Shapiro has not accepted my invitation to speak in such a forum. He has indicated that he will come to Cal State LA to speak today at the University-Student Union Theatre, where he was originally scheduled to deliver this talk.\"\n\nHe continued,\" I strongly disagree with Mr. Shapiro's views.\"\n\nADF Senior Counsel David Hacker said, \"Silencing the speech of students on a public university campus - the very marketplace of ideas - because of their views is not only illogical, it's unconstitutional. The university has made the right decision in allowing the Young Americans for Freedom event to proceed as planned and as we requested, without censorship and without unconstitutional fees.\"\n\nWND reported earlier the ADF got involved because the university had tried to charges those high fees to the students.\n\nThe group said the school's suggestion to have Shapiro speak alongside speakers the school chose was unreasonable.\n\nYAF, Hacker said has \"every bit as much right to hold this event as any other student group does, and the university can't stop that because it prefers to water down the speaker's message with other viewpoints that officials find more palatable to their own political views.\"\n\nFurther, he said, \"The courts have made it clear that university officials cannot deem an event 'controversial' and then weigh down students with burdensome fees to engage in constitutionally protected free speech just because some people consider it controversial, but it's even worse to take that a step further and try to silence the speech altogether.\"\n\nOne of those causing concern was Weide, who had attacked the YAF students over their beliefs.\n\nIn was in an email to student Mark Kahanding that Covino ordered the cancellation.\n\n\"I have decided that it will be best for our campus community if we reschedule Ben Shapiro's appearance for a later date, so that we can arrange for him to appear as part of a group of speakers with differing viewpoints on diversity,\" Covino ordered at the time.\n\nHe claimed his decision to stop Shapiro's speech and bring in other speakers \"will better represent our university's dedication to the free exchange of ideas and the value of considering multiple viewpoints.\"\n\nFox Business reported, \"[Shapiro] and YAF intend to hold the speech on Thursday despite the CSULA ban and threaten to sue if they are blocked from the auditorium where the speech was scheduled to take place.\"\n\n\"The campus fascists have taken over,\" Shapiro told Breitbart News. \"I pay taxes in the state of California; I'm paying for these whiny children to be indoctrinated by radical leftists. For CSULA to pretend that they're trying to provide balance isn't just stupid, it's insultingly stupid. I am the balance, and they're too afraid to let me speak. These aren't diversity warriors. They're jackbooted thugs. If they want to call the men with guns to shut down free speech, they'll demonstrate clearly just who they are. I'll be there on Thursday. See you there, snowflakes.\"\n\nADF said the student organization may end up taking legal action.\n\n\"The First Amendment does not require YAF to consolidate its viewpoint with others,\" Hacker noted. \"The number of events on university campuses with speakers who have different viewpoints from Mr. Shapiro's and YAF's are plentiful. No need or legitimate basis exists for canceling YAF's event.\"\n\nAccording to Fox Business, \"Covina did not cancel liberal focused speeches which include counter culture radical Angela Davis and Time Wise, who will lecture students on 'Exploring Whiteness' on Wednesday February 24th, or Serene Khader on the topic, 'Do Muslim Women Really Need Freedom?\"", "Award-winning cartoonist Ted Rall offers a graphic novel to inspire the next generation of whistleblowers and activists.\n\nTo the growing body of literature surrounding the tech industry's often controversial free speech activists - WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Chelsey Manning, and others - award-winning journalist and cartoonist Ted Rall offers a short, succinct and impassioned contribution to the sub-genre concerning exiled former defense contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nSnowden is written for the concerned member of the public who would like to know more about the Snowden saga but doesn't know where to start. The short graphic novel provides a brief and succinct overview of Snowden's biography, the government surveillance programs he blew the whistle on, the subsequent reaction and Snowden's journey into exile, and the broader implications the whole saga holds for the future of free speech, privacy rights, and government-endorsed law-breaking in the United States. Rall cuts to the chase of his subject matter, arguing passionately in defense of whistleblowing, free speech and privacy rights.\n\nRall's magic lies in situating his subjects within a broader parable. This is a biography with a point to make, not merely a dispassionate account of facts. Snowden opens with a discussion about George Orwell's iconic dystopian novel 1984, demonstrating just how closely US government surveillance has come to echo the villainous totalitarianism depicted in that novel. As recently as Snowden's high school years it would have seemed facetious to imagine a surveillance state like 1984 could come into being; yet technological breakthroughs coupled with a lack of ethical political oversight would lead Snowden to find himself working right in the heart of such a framework barely a decade later.\n\nRall underscores the hypocrisy of US politics mercilessly throughout. He dwells on Snowden's youthful dedication to the boy scouts, emphasizing again that the ethics Americans are brought up to pay lip service to are those which compel whistleblowers and dissidents to act. What made Snowden different from his peers in the intelligence community was that he chose to act on the beliefs Americans are raised with, rather than simply paying them lip service and then turning the other way.\n\nWhat was it that compelled Snowden to act ethically and reveal the epic criminality of the US intelligence regime? Rall ponders the question as he chronicles Snowden's early years. Was it the virtues drilled into him through Boy Scouts? Was it the unlikely idealism of pop culture: role-playing games, Magic: The Gathering, and video games like Tekken (which he would later cite as influencing his sense of morality)? Was it his parents' divorce, which Snowden is still reticent to talk about, and the desire to seek a sense of security in the form of a set of ethical virtues?\n\nWhat led this idealistic youth to turn against the government he'd been raised to cherish and honour? Both his parents were government employees; he grew up in communities that were founded and economically reliant on government jobs. Transcripts of early online chat-room discussions show a Snowden who was opposed to whistleblowers like WikiLeaks as he felt they threatened American security, while he responded to the Iraq War by trying to enlist and fight for democracy. Perhaps, suggests Rall, it was the aggressive racism of US military trainers and their thirst for Arab blood that repelled Snowden and led him to start questioning the direction in which his country was headed.\n\nSnowden isn't the only former government employee who's blown the whistle on government misdeeds. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David K. Shipler outlines other, less well known cases in his recent and insightful tome Freedom of Speech: Mightier Than the Sword. One of these individuals was Thomas Drake, another former NSA employee and whistleblower who faced extensive harassment and blacklisting by the US government for his role in exposing government misspending, conflict of interest and spying on citizens. For his book on Snowden, Rall interviewed Drake, in an effort to better understand the psyche of the intelligence community, and what makes employees go along even when they know or suspect government is doing something terribly wrong, unethical, or even illegal.\n\n\"It's the herd instinct,\" explains Drake. \"People go along to get along... You want to be loyal. Subservient. A team player. The need to belong is extraordinarily powerful - even more in the secret world.\"\n\nWhat made Drake act differently? Drake reflects on the values of individuality and independence that were instilled in him when he was young. He also cites the importance of seeing civil disobedience in action - as a youth in the '70s he saw activists burning their draft cards.\n\nWhat made Snowden unique, says Rall, is that \"in an organization that selects for unthinking conformists, he searched for truth and followed it to an ideological awakening.\"\n\nRall offers Snowden as a model for the virtuous citizen in the 21st century. \"Snowden wasn't following the baby boomer model of the civil disobedience martyr,\" he writes, \"but the Gen X example of the pragmatic activist. Snowden's strategy was to work with established media organizations... he was determined to stay out of jail - and become an explainer, a spokesperson for a cause that desperately needs one.\"\n\nRall's graphic novel is a quick and engaging read, heavily illustrated with a blend of cartoonish sketches and clips of photos and screenshots. Easily readable in a single sitting, and meticulously researched with plenty of citations and reference notes, it's a great introduction to our present era's struggle for free speech and privacy rights in an era of murky and confusing technological intrusions.\n\nSuitable for a broad audience of all ages, Rall offers a stirring defense of civil liberties and the protection of privacy that juxtaposes it against the easy dip into fascism that Orwell warned of in 1984, and that history already bore witness to during the reign of Nazi Germany and its fascist allies. Above all, Rall calls the reader to action, to learn from the example of independent and virtuous thinkers and actors like Edward Snowden.\n\n\"We sing that we live in the land of the free and the brave, but that's a lie,\" he concludes. \"Most of us do what we're told.\"", "I agree with James Causey's column in the Feb. 21 Journal Sentinel (\"Progressives want to even score on Milwaukee talk radio,\" Crossroads).\n\nA friend refers to conservative talk radio as \"hate talk radio\" and the hosts as \"squawkers.\" In my judgment, however, what is most upsetting is the name-calling by some, but not all, of the five conservative talk radio hosts mentioned in Causey's column.\n\nCharlie Sykes, for example, continually refers to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a respected newspaper and winner of three Pulitzer Prizes within the past eight years, as the \"Dead Tree.\" He calls Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Larson (who, by the way, I don't support) \"Sticky Fingers Larson.\" Sykes has repeatedly smeared Rep. Gwen Moore.\n\nHe regularly takes swipes, some fair but most unfair, at Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. Why? Because Barrett had the audacity to run against Scott Walker, Sykes' fair-haired boy, not once but twice. Walker proved last year in his ill-fated run for the presidency that he was clearly not ready for prime time. Even respected Marquette University President Michael Lovell has not escaped Sykes' caustic comments.\n\nSykes probably feels that most people are laughing with him for his name-calling. No, Charlie, most people aren't laughing with you; they are laughing at you.\n\nConcerning the recent \"immigration\" protests: I don't think anybody is opposed to immigration per se (\"Latinos amass in Madison for Capitol pro-immigration rally,\" Feb. 18).\n\nThe missing word is \"illegal.\" And, yes, I know from my own experience that being legal can be difficult and time consuming.\n\nWhen it comes to the Apple Inc. case (or to waterboarding), having lived for a time in a totalitarian state, I think I'm in a good position to cut the Gordian knot on this matter, get to the heart of the issue and add to what Ben Franklin had to say by pointing out that the question of protection is moot (\"U.S. slams Apple refusal,\" Feb. 20).\n\nFor the kind of nation that would engage in the actions recently under discussion is not the kind one would seek to protect against the world.

The government is using laws to crush dissent, and it's gotten so bad that even U.S. Supreme Court justices are saying that we are descending into tyranny. (And the U.S. is doing the same things that tyrannical governments have done for 5,000 years to crush dissent.)\n\nFor example, the following actions may get an American citizen living on U.S. soil labeled as a \"suspected terrorist\" today:\n\nAnd holding the following beliefs may also be considered grounds for suspected terrorism:\n\nDespite the clear protections found in the First Amendment, the freedoms described therein are under constant assault. Increasingly, Americans are being arrested and charged with bogus \"contempt of cop\" charges such as \"disrupting the peace\" or \"resisting arrest\" for daring to film police officers engaged in harassment or abusive practices. Journalists are being prosecuted for reporting on whistleblowers. States are passing legislation to muzzle reporting on cruel and abusive corporate practices. Religious ministries are being fined for attempting to feed and house the homeless. Protesters are being tear-gassed, beaten, arrested and forced into \"free speech zones.\" And under the guise of \"government speech,\" the courts have reasoned that the government can discriminate freely against any First Amendment activity that takes place within a government forum.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment states:\n\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\nGun control and gun rights advocates obviously have very different views about whether guns are a force for violence or for good.\n\nBut even a top liberal Constitutional law expert reluctantly admits that the right to own a gun is as important a Constitutional right as freedom of speech or religion:\n\nLike many academics, I was happy to blissfully ignore the Second Amendment. It did not fit neatly into my socially liberal agenda.\n\n***\n\nIt is hard to read the Second Amendment and not honestly conclude that the Framers intended gun ownership to be an individual right. It is true that the amendment begins with a reference to militias: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" Accordingly, it is argued, this amendment protects the right of the militia to bear arms, not the individual.\n\nYet, if true, the Second Amendment would be effectively declared a defunct provision. The National Guard is not a true militia in the sense of the Second Amendment and, since the District and others believe governments can ban guns entirely, the Second Amendment would be read out of existence.\n\n***\n\nMore important, the mere reference to a purpose of the Second Amendment does not alter the fact that an individual right is created. The right of the people to keep and bear arms is stated in the same way as the right to free speech or free press. The statement of a purpose was intended to reaffirm the power of the states and the people against the central government. At the time, many feared the federal government and its national army. Gun ownership was viewed as a deterrent against abuse by the government, which would be less likely to mess with a well-armed populace.\n\nConsidering the Framers and their own traditions of hunting and self-defense, it is clear that they would have viewed such ownership as an individual right -- consistent with the plain meaning of the amendment.\n\nNone of this is easy for someone raised to believe that the Second Amendment was the dividing line between the enlightenment and the dark ages of American culture. Yet, it is time to honestly reconsider this amendment and admit that ... here's the really hard part ... the NRA may have been right. This does not mean that Charlton Heston is the new Rosa Parks or that no restrictions can be placed on gun ownership. But it does appear that gun ownership was made a protected right by the Framers and, while we might not celebrate it, it is time that we recognize it.\n\nThe gun control debate - including which weapons and magazines are banned - is still in flux ...\n\nHowever:\n\nAmericans remain powerless to defend themselves against SWAT team raids and government agents armed to the teeth with military weapons better suited for the battlefield than for a country founded on freedom. Police shootings of unarmed citizenscontinue to outrage communities, while little is really being done to demilitarize law enforcement agencies. Indeed, just recently, North Dakota became the first state to legalize law enforcement use of drones armed with weapons such as tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbags, pepper spray and Tasers.\n\nThe 3rd Amendment prohibits the government forcing people to house soldiers:\n\nNo Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\n\nWith the police increasingly training like the military, acting like the military, and posing as military forces -- complete with military weapons, assault vehicles, etc. -- it is clear that we now have what the founders feared most -- a standing army on American soil. Moreover, as a result of SWAT team raids (more than 80,000 a year) where police invade homes, often without warrants, and injure and even kill unarmed citizens, the barrier between public and private property has been done away with, leaving us with armed government agents who act as if they own our property.\n\nThe 4th Amendment prevents unlawful search and seizure:\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nBut the government is spying on everything we do ... without any real benefit or justification.\n\nIndeed, experts say that the type of spying being carried out by the NSA and other agencies is exactly the kind of thing which King George imposed on the American colonists ... which led to the Revolutionary War.\n\nAnd many Constitutional experts - such as Jonathan Turley - think that the police went too far in Boston with lockdowns and involuntary door-to-door searches.\n\nIn reality:\n\nThe Fourth Amendment has suffered the greatest damage in recent years and been all but eviscerated by an unwarranted expansion of police powers that include strip searches and even anal and vaginal searches of citizens, surveillance and intrusions justified in the name of fighting terrorism, as well as the outsourcing of otherwise illegal activities toprivate contractors. Case in point: Texas police forced a 21-year-old woman to undergo awarrantless vaginal search by the side of the road after she allegedly \"rolled\" through a stop sign.\n\nThe use of civil asset forfeiture schemes to swell the coffers of police forces has also continued to grow in popularity among cash-strapped states. The federal government continues to strong-arm corporations into providing it with access to Americans' private affairs, from emails and online transactions to banking and web surfing. Coming in the wake of massive leaks about the inner workings of the NSA and the massive secretive surveillance state, it was revealed that the government threatened to fine Yahoo $250,000 every day for failing to comply with the NSA's mass data collection program known as PRISM. Meanwhile, AT&T has enjoyed a profitable and \"extraordinary, decades-long\" relationship with the NSA.\n\nThe technological future appears to pose even greater threats to what's left of our Fourth Amendment rights, with advances in biometric identification and microchip implants on the horizon making it that much easier for the government to track not only our movements and cyber activities but our very cellular beings. Barclays has already begun using a finger-scanner as a form of two-step authentication to give select customers access to their accounts. Similarly, Motorola has been developing thin \"digital tattoos\" that will ensure that a phone's owner is the only person who may unlock it. Not to be overlooked are the aerial spies -- surveillance drones -- about to take to the skies in coming years, as well as the Drive Smart programs that will spy on you (your speed, movements, passengers, etc.) while you travel the nation's highways and byways.\n\nThe 5th Amendment addresses due process of law, eminent domain, double jeopardy and grand jury:\n\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nBut the American government has shredded the 5th Amendment by subjecting us to indefinite detentionand taking away our due process rights.\n\nAs such, the government is certainly depriving people of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\n\nThere are additional corruptions of 5th Amendment rights - such as property being taken for privatepurposes. And the right to remain silent is gone.\n\nThe percentage of prosecutions in which a defendant is denied a grand jury is difficult to gauge, as there is so much secrecy surrounding many terrorism trials.\n\nImage by William Banzai\n\nThe 6th Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy ad public trial, by an impartial jury in the location where the crime allegedly occurred, to hear the criminal charges levied against us and to be able to confront the witnesses who have testified against us, as well as speedy criminal trials, and a public defender for those who cannot hire an attorney:\n\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\n\nSubjecting people to indefinite detention or assassination obviously violates the 6th Amendment right to a speedy and public jury trial. In both cases, the defendants is \"disposed of\" without ever receiving anytrial at all ... let alone a speedy or public one. In neither case do they get a jury, a defense lawyer, or the right to call their own witnesses. And they often never even hear the charges against them.\n\nIndefinite detentions usually don't occur where the alleged crime occurred, but at a black site.\n\nMore and more commonly, the government prosecutes cases based upon \"secret evidence\" that they don't show to the defendant ... or sometimes even the judge hearing the case.\n\nThe government uses \"secret evidence\" to spy on Americans, prosecute leaking or terrorism charges (even against U.S. soldiers) and even assassinate people. And see this and this.\n\nSecret witnesses are being used in some cases. And sometimes lawyers are not even allowed to read their own briefs.\n\nIndeed, even the laws themselves are now starting to be kept secret. And it's about to get a lot worse.\n\nMoreover, government is \"laundering\" information gained through mass surveillance through other agencies, with an agreement that the agencies will \"recreate\" the evidence in a \"parallel construction\" ... so they don't have to admit that the evidence came from unconstitutional spying. A former top NSA official says that this is the opposite of following the Fourth Amendment, but is a \"totalitarian process\" which shows that we're in a \"police state\".\n\nAnd some of the nation's most powerful judges have lost their independence ... and are in bed with the powers-that-be.\n\nConstitutional lawyer John Whitehead explains:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment work in tandem. These amendments supposedly ensure that you are innocent until proven guilty, and government authorities cannot deprive you of your life, your liberty or your property without the right to an attorney and a fair trial before a civilian judge. However, in the new suspect society in which we live, where surveillance is the norm, these fundamental principles have been upended. Certainly, if the government can arbitrarily freeze, seize or lay claim to your property (money, land or possessions) under government asset forfeiture schemes, you have no true rights. That's the crux of a case before the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the government's use of asset forfeiture to strip American citizens of the funds needed to hire a defense attorney of their choosing.\n\nThe 7th Amendment guarantees trial by jury in federal court for civil cases:\n\nIn Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\n\nBut there are two systems of justice in America ... one for the big banks and other fatcats, and one for everyone else. So good luck going after the powers-that-be.\n\nAnd the World Justice Project - a bipartisan, independent group with honorary chairs including numerous current and former Supreme Court Justices - released a report saying that Americans have less access to justice than most wealthy countries ... and many developing nations. The report finds that Americans have less access to justice than Botswanans, and that only the wealthy have the resources to protect rights using the court system:\n\nFor example, Germans sue equally whether they are rich or poor ... but in America, only the wealthy have the resources to protect rights using the court system:\n\n(And the austerity caused by the highest levels of inequality in world history - which are in turn is caused by socialist actions by our government, which have destroyed the Founding Fathers' vision of prosperity - is causing severe budget cuts to the courts, resulting in the wheels of justice slowing down considerably.)\n\nFederal judges have also recently decided that they can pre-judge cases before the plaintiff even has the chance to conduct discovery ... and throw cases out if they don't like plaintiff's case.\n\nAnd:\n\nThe populace has no idea of what's in the Constitution -- civic education has virtually disappeared from most school curriculums -- that inevitably translates to an ignorant jury incapable of distinguishing justice and the law from their own preconceived notions and fears. However, as a growing number of citizens are coming to realize, the power of the jury to nullify the government's actions -- and thereby help balance the scales of justice -- is not to be underestimated. Jury nullification reminds the government that it's \"we the people\" who can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes.\n\nThe 8th Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment:\n\nExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n\nWhile Justice Scalia disingenuously argues that torture does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it is meant to produce information - not punish - he's wrong. It's not only cruel and unusual ... it is technically a form of terrorism.\n\nAnd government whistleblowers are being cruelly and unusually punished with unduly harsh sentences meant to intimidate anyone else from speaking out.\n\nMoreover:\n\nA California appeals court is being asked to consider \"whether years of unpredictable delays from conviction to execution\" constitute cruel and unusual punishment. For instance, although 900 individuals have been sentenced to death in California since 1978, only 13 have been executed. As CBS News reports, \"More prisoners have died of natural causes on death row than have perished in the death chamber.\"\n\nThe 9th Amendment provides that people have other rights, even if they aren't specifically listed in the Constitution:\n\nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n\nWe can debate what our inherent rights as human beings are. I believe they include the right to a level playing field, and access to non-toxic food and water. You may disagree.\n\nBut everyone agrees that the government should not actively encourage fraud and manipulation. However, the government - through its malignant, symbiotic relation with big corporations - is interfering with our aspirations for economic freedom, safe food and water (instead of arsenic-laden, genetically engineered junk), freedom from undue health hazards such as irradiation due to government support of archaic nuclear power designs, and a level playing field (as opposed to our crony capitalist system in which the little guy has no shot due to redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the super-elite, and government support of white collar criminals).\n\nBy working hand-in-glove with giant corporations to defraud us into paying for a lower quality of life, the government is trampling our basic rights as human beings.\n\nThe 10th Amendment provides that powers not specifically given to the Federal government are reserved to the states or individual:\n\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nTwo of the central principles of America's Founding Fathers are:\n\n(1) The government is created and empowered with the consent of the people\n\nand\n\n(2) Separation of powers\n\nToday, most Americans believe that the government is threatening - rather than protecting - freedom. We've become more afraid of our government than of terrorists, and believe that the government is no longer acting with the \"consent of the governed\".\n\nAnd the federal government is trampling the separation of powers by stepping on the toes of the states and the people. For example, former head S&L prosecutor Bill Black - now a professor of law and economics - notes:\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the resident examiners and regional staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [both] competed to weaken federal regulation and aggressively used the preemption doctrine to try to prevent state investigations of and actions against fraudulent mortgage lenders.\n\nIndeed, the federal government is doing everything it can to stick its nose into every aspect of our lives ... and act like Big Brother.\n\nConclusion: While a few of the liberties enshrined in the Bill of Rights still exist, the vast majority are under heavy assault.\n\nIn addition to the trampling of the Bill of Rights, the government has also trashed the separation of powers enshrined in the main body of the Constitution.\n\nThe government is also engaging in activities which the Founding Fathers fought against, such as taxation without representation (here and here), cronyism, deference to central banks, etc.\n\nAs the preamble to the Declaration of Independence shows, the American government is still carrying out many of the acts the Founding Fathers found most offensive:\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. [Background here and here]\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. [Background here, here, here, here and here]\n\n***\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: [Background]\n\n***\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences [Background]\n\n***\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

[Background here, here and here]\n\nhttp://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/09/americans-have-lost-our-rights.html", "\u00a9 AP Photo/ Militant Website, FileChanging Tune? Israel Says It's Essentially Part of US Anti-Daesh CoalitionWASHINGTON (Sputnik) -- The United States took aim at the anti-Israel bias in the United Nations in a campaign to renew its membership in the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), the US Department of State stated in a press release on Monday.\n\nThe United States \"believes that its leadership was an important element of the [Security] Council's improved focus on urgent human rights crises, promotion of universal human rights such as freedom of expression, and decreased fixation on Israel,\" the statement said.\n\nIn nine years since the UN Human Rights Council was established, it has condemned Israel over actions in Palestinian territories more times than for every other nation combined, according to a 2015 report by UN Watch. The report said the UN Human Rights Council had condemned Israel 61 times compared with 55 times for rights violations of all other nations.\n\n\"The only country in the world with the standing agenda item at the Human Rights Council is not North Korea, a totalitarian state that is currently holding an estimated 100,000 people in gulags. It is not Syria, which has gassed lots of its people. It is Israel,\" the publication Jewish Voice quoted US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power as telling students at the American International School in Israel earlier this month.\n\nThe United Stated is completing a mandatory one-year hiatus from the UN Human Rights Council after serving two consecutive three-year terms, the release explained.", "Discussions about tampering with the coins and bills of U.S. currency traditionally have focused on doing away with the penny, that disrespected and almost worthless copper-colored filler of mason jars in your attic.\n\nLately, however, the debate has recalibrated to the highest end of the currency ladder, the $100 bill. The idea is that the century note has become the value storehouse of choice for criminals and terrorists, who find it convenient for laundering funds, transporting resources across national boundaries, and hiding illicit gains from the eyes of police and tax authorities.\n\nThere are so many legitimate ways of making and receiving payments in the modern world, argues Peter Sands of Harvard's Kennedy School in a recent paper, that \"high value notes are arguably an anachronism....They play little role in the functioning of the legitimate economy, yet a crucial role in the underground economy. The irony is that they are provided to criminals by the state.\"\n\nIs there a \"compelling case\" for withdrawing big bills from circulation, or at least placing a moratorium on their further issuance? That's what former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, vouching for the work of Sands, his Harvard colleague, argued in an op-ed a couple of weeks ago?\n\nIzabella Kaminska of the Financial Times acknowledges that \"in a world plagued by low productivity, inequality, negative interest rates and deflation, the idea that something as simple as a physical cash ban might magically turn things around is, understandably, a tempting proposition.\"\n\nHowever, she says wisely, \"perhaps things aren't as simple as that.\"\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nStart with the argument in favor of killing off high-denomination bills, which include the 500-euro note (worth about $544 in U.S. dollars) and the 50-pound note in Britain (worth about $70). Sands' judgment echoes a condemnation issued last year by Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, who trained his gunsights on all cash, not just high-denomination notes. His argument was that paper currency complicates the job of central bankers like those of the BoE and the Federal Reserve, especially when interest rates are so low they can only go lower by turning negative--that is, instead of paying to borrow money, you would effectively be paid to hold on to it.\n\nRates can only go so low before people realize that cash becomes more valuable the longer they hold it. \"Hoarding cash may be inconvenient and risky,\" observed economist Kenneth Rogoff in 2014, \"but if rates become too negative, it becomes worth it.\" If a severe economic slump occurred when rates were already low--like now--central bankers' only option for pushing rates lower to stimulate the economy would be to go negative, and they wouldn't want their ability to do so to be limited.\n\nThere's no disputing the assertion that cash is a preferred medium of exchange for the criminal element and underground economy. Cash businesses are renowned for their ability to evade taxes. The IRS, in its most recent assessment of the \"tax gap\"--the discrepancy between what is owed by taxpayers on their income and what is collected--placed the annual shortfall at about 17%. But almost all of that was for income from unofficial--read \"cash\"--sources. On wages and salaries reported on W-2 forms and withheld, only about 1% was misreported, the IRS said. For cash and other income not reported officially, the level was 56%.\n\nCash is easiest to transport illicitly, its critics say, particularly in large denominations. Sands calculates that $1 million in cash can be transported in a single briefcase, with space left over for a sandwich and a paperback book, if it's in $100 bills. If it had to be carried in $20 bills, it would require three and a half briefcases, which would make it hard to move using just a single currency mule.\n\nEliminating high-value bills would inconvenience almost no one engaged in legitimate commerce, it's said. Although big bills typically account for a huge share of total currency by value (77% of the total U.S. cash in circulation is in $100 bills), almost no one routinely uses them for workaday transactions. In pthat's art because many small businesses won't change them.\n\nMore often, they're totems brandished by the wealthy or privileged, who like having them in their billfolds for show. Like all other economic phenomena, this is relative; when I lived in Kenya in the 1980, the highest denomination of the local currency was the 500-shilling note, worth about $30. The notes were known on the street as \"Pajeros,\" after the Mitsubishi Motors SUVs favored by European and American expatriates. Every note was crisp and clean, unlike the greasy and grubby lower-denomination bills used as legal tender by ordinary Kenyans. To change a Pajero, one usually had to take it to a bank, which wasn't always so willing to change it either.\n\nBut there's another side to the argument. \"The argument that eliminating the $100 will automatically reduce crime is, at best, suspect,\" argues Nicholas Colas of the brokerage firm Convergex, quoted by Kaminska. The criminal element is smarter and more resourceful than the anti-currency camp makes out; if it's denied access to high denomination currencies, it will find something else nearly as good.\n\nAlready numerous instruments are available--everything from gift cards to virtual currencies. Gift card issuers typically take steps to limit their use as currency, including fees and expiration ates, but they don't have to do so. There may not be that much distance between Amazon as a gift-card exchanger to Amazon as a central bank.\n\nUsers of high-denomination currency may be a special group, but in absolute terms not a small one. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston estimated in 2014 that about 20% of American consumers carried $100 or more in their wallets, and of those one in four carried at least one $100 bill, mostly for convenience. They're \"easier to carry,\" the Boston Fed found, \"than a fat wad of 20s, 10s, or lower denominations.\"\n\nAnd for many consumers, the privacy afforded by cash is a virtue, even if one is engaged in a perfectly legal lifestyle. Electronic payment and banking systems are anything but secure, as anyone knows who has received an apologetic notice from a bank or retailer that its data system has been hacked. (And that's pretty much everybody.)\n\nAdd Stephen Cecchetti of Brandeis University and Kermit Schoenholtz of NYU observe, the privacy of financial transactions should be seen on balance as a virtue. \"We are what we buy,\" they've written, \"so protecting our privacy requires controlling information about our payments.\" That applies to residents of totalitarian government as well as those in open democracies. \"Cash is a vehicle for freedom. Freedom from homicidal dictators as well as freedom from tax collectors. Ultimately, if someone is going to issue cash to protect these freedoms, it might as well be the government that collects the seignorage rather than a private agent.\" (\"Seignorage\" is the profit governments earn by issuing currency at face values in excess than the cost to produce the bills and coins.)\n\n\"All of this leads us to conclude that paper currency is at the heart of how we choose to organize our society,\" they write. \"In a free society, criminality may be part of the price we pay for liberty.\" Paper money, they say, hasn't yet come close to outliving its purpose.\n\nKeep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

With many examples, professor Mausfeld gives insight in the actual management of our democracy and how people are kept in apathy and in the illusion of being informed.\n\n\"WHY ARE THE LAMBS SILENT?\"\n\nDemocracy, Psychology and Techniques of Opinion- and Outrage Management\n\nTechniques that make serious violations of moral norms by the ruling elites morally and cognitively invisible for the population\n\nBy Rainer Mausfeld\n\n[This lecture at the University of Kiel, June 22, 2015 published on Free21.org is translated abridged from the German on the Internet. With many examples, Professor Mausfeld gives insight in the actual management of our democracy and how people are kept in apathy and in the illusion of being informed.]\n\nViolations of moral norms are \"morally invisible\" even when they are visible as facts. Embedding them in a context prevents moral unease or indignation in the population. The social and humanitarian consequences of the structural violence going along with the neoliberal economic system are one example. This violence is increasingly manifest in western industrial countries and in the so-called \"third world.\"\n\nViolations of moral norms are \"cognitively invisible\" even when they are visible as facts. Embedding them in a context prevents drawing conclusions from them. No connections are made to comparable cases that are judged according to completely different criteria by the respective elites. So-called \"targeted killings\" of persons regarded as security risks by a state are an example. Those murders represent a clear breach of international law and would not be accepted in a comparable way when carried out by states regarded by \"us\" as \"enemies.\"\n\nThe visibility and invisibility of facts is essentially mediated by the mass media that - besides the facts - usually communicate the desired interpretation context and \"political worldview.\" Thus the theme becomes part of our daily social routine and concerns all of us. The questions raised here are more fundamental and have a more elementary nature. To grapple with them, no expert knowledge is needed even if the ruling elites seek to limit discourse on these themes to groups of \"qualified experts.\" By nature we are outfitted with a natural ability of our spirit, a \"light of reason\" - a lumen naturale, as it was called in the Enlightenment - for themes that affect all of us as citoyens, as citizens who strive for community in the spirit of the Enlightenment. Thus we can deal with essential questions without a specialist education.\n\n\"You already know enough. So do I. We don't lack knowledge. What is missing is the courage to understand what we know and draw conclusions.\"\n\nSven Lindquist (1992). Exterminate All the Brutes.\n\nThe capability for questioning facts in the social-political realm and the categorizing, ordering and judging phenomena, is part of the natural wealth of our spirit. The neoliberal newspeak covering up and concealing what was really meant that could easily fill an Orwellian-Newspeak dictionary is a prominent example. Terms like structural reforms, will to reform, dismantling bureaucracy, deregulation, stabilization pact, austerity, euro-bailout umbrella, free market, sleek state, liberalization, harmonization, market-conforming democracy, without alternative, human capital, subcontracted labor, non-wage labor costs, social envy, achievers etc. could be included here. These terms transport ideological worldviews whose totalitarian character should be uncovered and identified.\n\nWe must identify and become aware of the silent premises, prejudices and ideological components in which we speak about social-political phenomena so we do not succumb unconsciously and unintentionally to these ideological worldviews. We also do not need any expert knowledge for this activity. Here we are all equipped by nature through the natural wealth of our spirit that must be exercised and refined.\n\nSeveral silent premises and ideological components hidden in the concepts with which the ruling elites seek to stabilize their power in democratic societies should be identified. With a perception phenomenon, I would like to illustrate the problem of facts made invisible.\n\nWe can see fragments of objects without recognizing the actual context of these fragments. Why is the context invisible? The answer given by cognitive psychology is that the perception system cannot apply its categories of meaning if the fragmentation cause is not recognized. We can easily complete what is hidden and recognize the context as soon as the cause is made visible through which objects are fragmented. A general psychic law appears here. A context of facts can be made invisible through a fragmented presentation. As a rule, we do not see more than a collection of isolated information fragments in reading a daily newspaper. But we have no problems in recognizing the connection of meaning as soon as the cause of fragmentation is recognized in the fragmentation of information.\n\nTHE PARADOX OF DEMOCRACY\n\nWhy or how can facts be made invisible through fragmentation? This leads directly to the question: who makes facts invisible and for whom? To answer this question, we must begin with the problem of the relation of elites and the people which is often described as a \"paradox of democracy.\" The systematic analysis of this problem goes back to antiquity. In political discourse, the people are often compared with a herd inclined to irrational emotions and as a result controllable. Therefore interpreting the silence of the herd in the sense of their political action is important for the political leadership. In recent times, this theme became popular through Richard Nixon who interpreted the silence of the \"silent majority\" as approval of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Greek historian Thucydides (454-399 B.C.) was the first to analyze these questions in a systematic way... \"Political leaders are guided by a 'longing for power' to satisfy their domineering and ambition.\" Thucydides emphasized that a society must take account of the weak spots of human nature...\n\nAristotles (384-322 B.C.) represented a similar view. He regarded the timocracy, the \"rule of the respectable and owners\" as an ideal government. Democratic and oligarchic elements should be balanced so neither the multitude, the poor, the elites or the rich can gain superiority. Aristotles considered democracy a decayed or ruined form of timocracy because democracy includes the possibility that \"the poor as the majority could divide the wealth of the rich among themselves\" which Aristotles considered unjust.\n\nThe same basic idea can also be found in the origins of the American constitution. Every government must protect the minority of the opulent against the majority,\" said James Madison (1751-1836), one of the founding fathers of the American constitution. Madison's solution for this tension between the people and elites was \"representative democracy\" - a de facto form of oligarchy - guaranteeing the self-interests of the minority of the rich.\n\nThe whole western history of ideas is pervaded by a deep skepticism toward democracy and often hostility to democracy as these few examples illustrate. [1]\n\nNevertheless the term democracy plays an ever-greater role in the political discourse and political rhetoric of the modern age. Democracy is the only form in which political power can be legitimated; it is not only one of the possible forms of rule. The ruling elites see democracy as a \"necessary illusion\" and strive to establish oligarchic structures to protect their own interests behind the rhetoric of democracy. They declare serious democratic achievements as \"excess of democracy\" and try to erode democratic structures in a way that is least visible to the population. This process is now accelerating in an alarming way. The legislative procedures of the EU, World Bank, IMF, TTIP and the \"Troika\" may be enough examples.\n\nEstablishing oligarchic structures under a democratic cloak succeeded because western democracies actually have the character of oligarchies. This view is shared by the ruling elites themselves and is not only defended by critics of this de-democratization process. In a 1975 report titled \"The Crisis of Democracy,\" Samuel Huntington said the management of \"democracy\" was still relatively simple when President Truman \"governed the country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers.\" Since then, the \"excess of democracy\" was corrected so the Washington Times could write on April 21, 2014: \"America is no longer a democracy - never mind the democratic republic envisioned by the Founding Fathers.\" In an interview on July 28, 2015, former US president Jimmy Carter called the US an \"oligarchy\" with an \"unlimited political bribery.\" Thus the oligarchic character of the US represents an obvious fact for the elites... Sixty percent of the population has no influence on political decisions. [2]\n\nThis does not look any different in Europe. The Wall Street Journal is a good source for a halfway realistic picture of reality. In this media, one finds a relatively unspoilt view of reality because a view that is not too ideologically distorted is important for the financial elite and business leaders. Since this information media is directed as members of the elites, crude political rhetoric and propaganda that the mass media keeps ready for the population can be avoided. In a matter of fact way, the Wall Street Journal of February 28, 2013 admitted the neoliberal program cannot win democratic elections. [3] In Europe, the idea that voters determine the outcome of elections or influence \"system-relevant\" political decisions also proves to be an illusion.\n\nThis is hardly surprising with questions of economic policy because neoliberalism and democracy are in fact incompatible. Milton Friedman (1912-2006), one of the founding fathers of neoliberalism, said this openly in 1990: \"A democratic society once established destroys a free economy\" (Newsletter of the Mont Pelerin Society). From the view of the elites, democracy should obviously be prevented. Thus democracy is only \"tolerable\" as long as the realm of the economy is spared democratic decision-making processes - that is, as long as it is not a democracy. In this sense, neoliberalism is the greatest enemy of democracy worldwide. Democracy represents a business risk from the perspective of multinational corporations. \"Structural adjustment measures\" must be carried out in authoritarian ways if the population refuses to see economic \"practical necessities\" are inalienable and that wages and social benefits are never negative for increasing capital.\n\nThus a truly democratically organized society is incompatible with the forms of society favoring the ruling elites. When \"democracy\" in political affairs is considered a \"necessary illusion,\" democracy assumes the form of a \"spectator democracy\" guided by qualified experts rather than a participative democracy. In a spectator democracy, the illusion of a democracy is maintained and the stability of political elites is guaranteed.\n\nThe influential report \"The Crisis of Democracy\" was occupied with these problems. This 1975 report was commissioned by the so-called \"Trilateral Commission.\" \"Trilateral\" refers to the fact that members of this elite advisory commission came from the three big economic blocks North America, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission has close ties to other elite networks, particularly to the Bilde4rberg conference and the Atlantic Bridge. Joseph Ackermann, Gerhard Schroeder and Theo Sommer are members of the German section.\n\nIn \"The Crisis of Democracy\" report, the crisis of democracy caused by an \"excess in democracy\" can only be solved and democracy can only be managed (in the view of the elites) when some individuals and groups show a certain measure of apathy and non-involvement... The spectator democracy desired by the ruling elites can only be attained when the population is largely de-politicized and struck down by political lethargy and moral apathy.\n\nThis goal can only be reached when certain techniques are available, techniques of apathy-induction (through worries about financial livelihood, fear production, consumerism etc), techniques of opinion management and techniques of outrage management.\n\nDEMOCRACY AND PROPAGANDA\n\nIf the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of government are compared - as the American political scientist Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) did in harmony with widespread ideas in the elite-democracy has the advantage when citizens agree with the political system and the decisions made by a specialized political class for them. This can only be guaranteed through techniques of propaganda. Thus propaganda is unavoidably part of the nature of a \"functioning\" democracy. Techniques of opinion management have the advantage over a dictator's control techniques that they are \"cheaper than violence, bribery or other possible control techniques.\" In this sense, democracy - when steered by opinion management - could be regarded as an optimal form of government.\n\nThis was expressed in an unusual openness by Edward Bernays (1891-1995). Edward Bernays was the most influential propagandist of propaganda whose foundations and techniques he worked out in his 1928 book \"Propaganda.\" Propaganda consists in all systematic attempts at undermining the natural human discernment and producing attitudes, convictions and opinions by which people can be misused to the advantage of the ruling elites (\"incapacitation,\" \"instrumentalization\"). [4]\n\nIn his book Bernays writes: \"The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the attitudes and behavior of the masses is an essential element of democratic societies. Organizations that work in secret control social events. These organizations form an invisible government that is the true ruling power of our country.\" The situation described by Bernays was the present and not the goal. This situation has intensified considerably since then. Propaganda can be considered today a necessary part of the indoctrination system of all western societies. The \"invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country\" consists of nearly invisible networks of different elites. These \"control the course of social events.\" They guide political decisions and communicate them through the \"embedded journalists\" of the mass media of the public as an avoidable practical necessity for the well-being of the population. [5]\n\nHow can this state of an \"invisible government\" and a population characterized by apathy desired by the elites be achieved? Obviously the mass media play a central role. Very clear insights about this function can be found in Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the most important communication researchers and one of the founders of modern empirical social research: \"\"Citizens must be covered with a flood of information so they have the illusion of being informed.\" A citizen has a politically clear conscience through this illusion of being informed. He imagines he is informed about everything essential and can quietly sleep at night.\" [6]\n\nFor Lazarsfeld, the mass media is the \"most respectable and efficient of social narcotics.\" When citizens feel informed by the mass media, they are so overpowered by their feeling of being informed that \"the addict is kept from recognizing his own malady,\" Lazarsfeld diagnoses.\n\nThe so-called educated classes are especially susceptible to the illusion of being informed. For obvious reasons, these sectors are indoctrinated by the dominant ideology. This was not different in National Socialism than today. Through their silent tolerance, this indoctrination of being informed is an important stabilizing element of the dominant ideologies.\n\nThere are many examples of narcotization carried out in emotional ways.\n\nTechniques of fear production are also significant. A double strategy is used in the legitimation rhetoric for military interventions. The educated parts of the population can be easily won for offensive war under the banner of \"humanitarian interventions.\" The remaining part can be won most easily through fear-production of malicious and violent forces. The former US Secretary of State Colin Powell before the UN Security Council on February 5, 2003 with a powder-filled test tube in his hand gave a historically famous example with tremendous consequences. That \"clear evidence\" should demonstrate that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This \"proof\" was directed above all to the American population and had the goal of increasing fears so they supported the long-planned US invasion of Iraq. This emotional manipulation was extremely effective and had the collateral effect that more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians were murdered as a consequence. The most momentous recent example of making hegemonial policy with fear production is the mass media reporting on Russia and the Ukraine. [8]...\n\nControlling opinions is more important than purely emotional control because opinions are usually more stable than emotions. Therefore a special importance comes to techniques that can control opinions. No special knowledge of psychology is needed for these simple techniques. They are the standard methods of the mass media:\n\n1. Declare facts to be opinions. Dealing with facts as though they are mere opinions is one of the most frightening aspects of totalitarian thought systems, Hannah Arendt explained.\n\n2. Fragment the presentation of connected facts so the context is lost.\n\n3. De-contextualize facts so they are removed from their real contexts and seem as isolated cases.\n\n4. Re-contextualize facts, embed them in a new context with \"positive\" accompaniments so they lose their original context and the possible potential of moral indignation...\n\nHow can negative political facts be made cognitively and morally invisible?\n\nInstead of asking about the alleged or actual motives leading governments to commit these crimes, I would like to direct attention to the population or ourselves and ask about the reasons we did not react with a proper moral outrage or indignation...\n\nThe following examples fulfill three criteria: (i) They refer to acts for which we are responsible, that is the political community to which we belong. (ii) They refer to clear violations of moral norms and crimes, acts to which we would have reacted immediately if our enemy committed them. (iii) They are undisputed, well-documented and even reported by the mass media (even if fragmented and re-contextualized).\n\nMAKING \"LITTLE FACTS\" INVISIBLE\n\n... For years, human rights organizations condemned the human rights violations by the World Bank. On April 16, 2015, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported: \"Slums are partly flattened without advance warning in infrastructure projects in Africa financed by the World Bank. Residents are forcibly resettled or made homeless.\" In the last decade alone, 3.4 million persons in 900 World Bank projects lost their land or part of the life foundation.\" The population can be told about these momentous facts free of risk as long as the context necessary for their understanding remains largely invisible. These crimes do not especially interest or alarm the population.\n\nConcrete things like torture are different. In torture, there is a culprit. Our natural moral indignation and moral sensitivity are triggered when a concrete perpetrator can be identified and the cause of a crime is not abstract. However facts can be made morally invisible with fragmentation and de-contextualization.\n\nUzbekistan is an example. Uzbekistan is one of the worst dictatorships of the world. Its regime systematically commits the worst human rights violations like mass murder, torture and child labor. However torture in Uzbekistan is tolerated according to German state logic since Germany has an air force base and strategic interests there. [10]...\n\nMAKING \"MASSIVE FACTS\" INVISIBLE\n\n\"It never happened. Nothing ever happens. Even when it happened, it did not happen. It played no role and interested no one.\" Harold Pinter\n\n...Magic can require an expensive and sophisticated machine. An opinion management, the machine that makes facts invisible, namely control of the mass media, is expensive but the necessary psychological techniques are not especially sophisticated.\n\nI will cite only one example of massive facts, namely the number of civilians killed in the interventions carried out by the US since the 2nd World War. \"We\" are jointly responsible since the US is Germany's closest ally and \"transatlantic relations are based on common shared values.\"\n\nIf the civilian casualties of US interventions are added up, there were 10 to 15 million in the Vietnam/ Korea wars and another 9 to 14 million through belligerent acts of the US and its co-culprits (for example\n\nin Afghanistan, Angola, Congo, East Timor, Guatemala, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sudan). Altogether the US is responsible for the deaths of 30 to 30 million persons through attacks on other countries since the 2nd World War according to official data or estimates of human rights organizations.\n\nThese crimes were and are accompanied by a chorus of self-adulation of western politicians, eager journalists and intellectuals. For them, these acts are only expressions of the \"world's greatest force for peace and freedom, democracy, security and prosperity,\" as former president Clinton said (on April 28, 1996).\n\nIn the last 15 years alone, four million Muslims were killed by \"us,\" by the \"western value community\" to stamp out terrorism in the world. This is part of a long historical continuity of the \"western value community\" - from European colonialism and its \"civilizing mission\" and the Vietnam War... to \"humanitarian interventions\" and \"civilizing missions\" for democracy and human rights.\n\nA considerable fragmentation and a radical re-contextualization as a \"struggle for democracy and human rights\" are needed in the media presentation of these crimes so crimes of this order and their historical continuity become almost invisible for the public.\n\nAll this hardly exists in public consciousness although it is all documented in detail.\n\n\"How many people must one kill before the titles mass murderer and war criminal are earned? \" Harold Pinter asked in his 2005 speech on the award of the Nobel Prize. He recalled the web of lies, \"the vast tapestry of lies upon which we feed.\" To \"maintain\" the power of the ruling elites, it is indispensable that people remain ignorant and live in ignorance of the truth, even the truth of their own lives.\" Making the above-named crimes invisible in the consciousness of the population is part of this vast tapestry of lies.\n\n\"They simply did not happen. It never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even when it happened, it did not happen. It played no role and interested no one.\" The alarming question is raised how moral apathy could reach such an extent. \"What has happened to our moral sensibility? Did we ever have any? What do these words mean?\" The answer leads us to the magic art because producing such a moral apathy is a brilliant, clever and extremely successful act of hypnosis.\"\n\nThe most important medium, for such collective hypnosis is obviously language. Whoever rules language, the terms and categories in which we reflect and speak about social-political phenomena, can easily rule us. \"Thinking can be kept in check with the help of language.\" [11]\n\n\"Massive\" facts can be made morally invisible through simple psychological techniques. These techniques are deeply anchore4d in the \"normal\" functioning of the mass media and even characterize the mass media and are hardly recognizable as consciously applied techniques. These manipulation techniques are merely expressions of the popular wisdom \"I sing the song of the one whose bread I eat\" and do not have to be implemented through a kind of central control. These techniques result almost automatically if one knows the song instructing the population.\n\nNECESSITY OF \"INDIGNATION MANAGEMENT\"\n\nFrom the view of the ruling elites, situations can be very dangerous for the stability of a system because they hide the potential of a chain reaction. Typically these situations are triggered by incidents that address the moral sensitivity of the population so fiercely they react with indignation. These situations can be quickly and effectively deactivated. Techniques aiming at a long-term control of opinions are often not enough and special techniques are necessary to control the outrage. The publication of the torture pictures from the US-operated Iraqi prison in Abu Ghraib [12] is a typical example of a situation in which the moral sensitivity of the population was addressed so sharply.\n\nFrom the view of the elites, \"stability-endangering\" indignation reactions of one's own population - as in the case of torture or mass surveillance - should be quickly contained or diverted to pseudo-goals.\n\nIndignation reactions of the population of a \"friendly\" country could also endanger \"stability\" - as a rule of one's own hegemonial interests and must be controlled. This is particularly true when these reactions manifest in a collectively organized way. In this case, one speaks of \"fighting rebellion\" with the necessary control techniques. On the other hand, if indignation reactions of the population involve non pro-western states in which \"we\" strive for a system change, rebellions are obviously to be roused through techniques of indignation management and not combated. In these cases we speak of \"colored revolutions\" that are vital to control to \"promote democracy and human rights.\"\n\nCOUNTER-INSURGENCY\n\nMethods of counter-insurgency as military operations below the war threshold (\"low intensity warfare represents the most important and comprehensive area of intervention methods and far surpass classical warfare in significance).\n\nThese include all the methods that are regarded as terrorism according to official definitions of terrorism: illegitimate acts of violence to reach political or ideological goals through fear-producing. [13] In the case of \"counter-insurgency,\" this form of terrorism is called \"counter-terrorism.\" Thus anti-terrorism and terrorism are only different depending on whether acts of violence were committed by \"us\" or by our enemy. Thus the term \"terrorism\" is a term that is deeply soaked ideologically. This is also true for the term \"counter-insurgency.\" Uncovering its silent premises is important. The word \"rebellious\" always implies the perspective of the dominant system. Those who threaten the stability of \"our\" desired system are called \"rebels\" or \"insurgents\" while those who threaten the stability of a system not desired by \"us\" are described as \"freedom fighters\"...\n\nPROVOKING REBELLION\n\n.... Hidden system change has a higher acceptance than coops or putsches in the western public and in the international alliance of states. A regime that comes to power in a non-violent way and as an alleged expression of the popular will is already regarded as democratically legitimated...\n\nAll activities promoting hegemonial interests are accompanied by specialized global propaganda firms that call themselves PR-agencies. These firms are largely invisible for the public despite their great influence in the mass media - for example Hill & Knowlton Strategies which gained a certain notoriety through the \"incubator lie\" of 1990. Barson-Marsteller and the Rendon Group have had considerable success in selling the politically desired reality to the public and not only wars.\n\nThis political context of continuity over many decades is largely invisible for the public since the mass media fragment this continuity into isolated cases...\n\nTHE ART OF DECEPTION\n\nMore than public opinion, the indignation potential of the general public is a much too precious asset to be left to accident. Since we control moral sensitivities by our nature, the control of our moral indignation potential presupposes that a sufficient measure of political apathy is produced in the population. Techniques must be available with which all facts that could endanger this apathy can be made morally invisible. Serious and systematic human rights violations are included here because they can appeal to our natural moral sensitivities.\n\nReal-politics refers to democracy, human rights or moral norms as only rhetorical husks with which the population can be controlled. Techniques are needed through which the population can be deceived about the discrepancy of political rhetoric and reality and so guarantee the stability of the political order. Such deception succeeds all the more effectively, the more one considers the laws of the functioning of our spirit.\n\nIn the last decades, psychology has won new and deeper insights in the laws of the functioning of our spirit. Many of these insights can be utilized for refining the techniques of propaganda and deception.\n\nGiven historical experiences, it is hardly surprising that enough psychologists can be found who are ready to serve such an enterprise. As only one example, the American Psychological Association (APA), the largest organization of psychologists in the world, organized a 2003 Science of Deception Workshop together with the CIA. The goal of this workshop was to discuss the latest psychological findings so the population could be best deceived \"for this purpose of national security.\"\n\nOther secret services are also interested in findings of psychology for opening possibilities, refining techniques of deception and developing opinion manipulation. Through the Snowden documents, a manual of British intelligence Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was made known [The Intercept, 2/25/2014] that was devoted to the possibilities of deceiving the population and making facts invisible. The manual was titled \"The Art of Deception\" and included the clown or charlatan picture from Hieronymus Busch.\n\nCan we protect ourselves from systematic manipulation of our attitudes, convictions and opinions?...\n\nOnly when we recognize that we are in a manipulation context and then actively avoid the media with its manipulations do we have a chance of preserving a remnant of autonomy.\n\nHowever we fulfill all the prerequisites in an optimal way for successful manipulation techniques if we voluntarily expose ourselves to the manipulation context and are convinced that on the whole we can distinguish truth from deception in the \"news\" of the private or public mass media.\n\nThe human spirit is constituted so there are many possibilities for its manipulation and thus for \"instrumentalizing\" people for the power needs of others. Nevertheless we have by nature a rich repertoire of intellectual possibilities for recognizing and actively avoiding manipulation contexts. We have a natural immune system against manipulations. We only need to resolve to use it.\n\nThe motto of the Enlightenment was ja sapere aude, dare to know, dare to notice - or in Kant's words, dare to use your own intelligence. Only when we resolve to use our intelligence, only when we overcome our induced moral apathy, only when we are not satisfied with the illusion of being informed, the illusion of democracy and the illusion of freedom do we have a chance of escaping these manipulation techniques. This is not an easy challenge but we have no other choice. The decision is ours.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nRainer Mausfeld, \"Neoliberal Indoctrination,\" Jan 18, 2016,\n\nhttp://portland.indymedia.org/en/2016/02/431734.shtml\n\nNew Ebook Anthology \"Alternative Economics: Reversing Stagnation,\" 140 pp, translated by Marc Batko, Feb 28, 2016\n\nhttp://www.smashwords.com/books/view/604567", "As movie viewers, we've lost the ability to enjoy silent films. That's not even a criticism, really. Unless you first came to films in the silent era, those movie-watching muscles just haven't developed. There's a whole other language to silent films, a way of storytelling that, accustomed as we are to the dialogue and sound-heavy film experience, can seem distancing, even dull.\n\nOf course, silent films were rarely silent. By the time movies took hold of the public imagination, silents were accompanied by music -- sometimes recorded, oftentimes played live. Scores were written specifically for the purpose, with some directors like Charles Chaplin writing their own music in order to ensure their cinematic vision. Other times, a house organist or orchestra was left to interpret the film as they saw fit, scoring the images on the screen according to their own musical interpretation.\n\n\"Metropolis,\" director Fritz Lang's gloriously loopy 1927 allegorical sci-fi silent masterpiece, screening on Sunday at Portland's Merrill Auditorium, promises a restoration of the best of the silent movie-going experience. Accompanying Lang's operatic fable of a totalitarian society where workers dwell deep underground fueling the lifestyle of the decadent rich who live atop impossibly huge skyscrapers, acclaimed conductor and organist Peter Krasinski will play an original organ score all through the film's two-and-a-half hour running time. And \"Metropolis\" is no place for the weak, musically speaking. Local musician Samuel James, who performed a similar gig accompanying Buster Keaton's 1926 silent classic \"The General\" (on guitar, banjo, and harmonica) in Portland a few years ago, calls the experience \"Easily the most difficult thing I've done musically,\" adding, \"Playing for 80 minutes straight ain't no joke.\" And \"Metropolis\" is fully an hour longer.\n\nThe story of a wealthy layabout from above who falls in love with a heroic, impoverished teacher from the working classes, \"Metropolis\" is a mammoth, expansive allegory, filled with Lang's still-fantastic, futuristic sets (he pioneered the use of miniatures for his massive cityscapes), mad scientists, full-scale class warfare, Biblical interludes, jaw-dropping dream sequences (including the ubiquitous, dangerous machines transforming into a worker-devouring demon), and what is still one of cinema's greatest robots. Chases, love scenes, riots, explosions, floods, fires -- Krasinski's got his work cut out for him.\n\nOf course, in its nearly 100 year cinematic history, \"Metropolis\" is no stranger to musicians brave (or foolhardy) enough to rise to the challenge. Gottfried Huppertz's original theatrical score was suitably Wagnerian in tone, but the film has inspired everything from sprawling tecnho scores to experimental works to jazz. Strangest perhaps was pop producer and musician Goirgio Moroder's 1984 theatrical reissue, where a pared-down, color-tinted version of the film flashed by to a pounding rock score from the likes of Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, and Loverboy, among other unlikely candidates. (In rewatching the movie, I tried pairing it up with artists as disparate as Brian Eno, Tom Waits, Billy Bragg, and a few others. Oddly, The Wu-Tang Clan seemed to synch up most often. Huh.)\n\nRegardless of the music -- and, all experimentation aside, Krasinski's improvisational scores are widely praised -- \"Metropolis\" remains one of the most influential films of all time. It's politics might be on the simplistic side -- class warfare's no match for love -- but the film's impact has been potent (and flexibly vague) enough to see it championed by socialists and dictatorships alike. (The Jewish Lang fled for America immediately upon learning that Hitler was a huge fan.) And you can see its impact in science fiction films as disparate as \"Blade Runner\" and \"Star Wars,\" with the film's iconic female robot, Maria, echoing through cinematic robot design from C-3PO right up through the conflicted artificial heroine of last year's \"Ex Machina.\" Especially when paired with the right music, a showing of \"Metropolis\" can be an immersive, awe-inspiring time at the movies.\n\nWHEN: 3 p.m. Sunday\n\nWHERE: Merrill Auditorium, Portland\n\nHOW MUCH: $18, free for children 12 (although a ticket is required)\n\nINFO: tickets.porttix.com/public/show.asp\n\nPMA Films -- Portland Museum of Art\n\nFriday: \"Mustang.\" An Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film this year, this Turkish drama follows the lives of five young Turkish sisters whose innocent indiscretion sees their conservative parents sequestering them from modern life until they can be married off.

However, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) - self-billed as \"America's largest Muslim civil liberties organization\" and headquartered on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. - pressured the FBI, and all references to Islam were removed.\n\nThe website seeks to deconstruct some of the motivating factors that lead people into extremism. It is aimed for use in high schools or other programs for teenagers.\n\nThe website was originally slated to launch last November, but the criticism by CAIR prevented this. CAIR - which faces a possible ban in the U.S.; see below - said that the focus on extremist Muslims could \"stigmatize and increase bullying of Muslim students.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported at the time that a pre-launch program for representatives of Arab and other groups highlighted some of the problems. Hoda Hawa, director of policy and advocacy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said she was particularly troubled by a question that asked the user to identify which of several social media posts should raise alarm.\n\nAmong the choices: a person posting about a plan to attend a political event, and someone with an Arabic name posting about going on \"a mission\" overseas. The fact that the latter was the correct answer troubled Ms. Hawa. \"What kind of mission?\" she said. \"It could have been humanitarian. It could have been religious.\"\n\nFollowing the removal of Islamist mentions, the site was finally launched about three weeks ago.\n\nClarion Project - whose goals are \"educating the public about Islamic extremism and providing a platform for Muslim human rights activists\" - is critical of the watered-down FBI site.\n\n\"There is no reason why a site that targets the specific roots of Islamist terrorism and tackles the ideology openly should increase the bullying of Muslim students,\" the organization states. \"On the contrary, if the site's explanation properly separates the theocratic totalitarian political ideology of Islamism from the religion of Islam in general, then it should have the opposite impact - calming fears about Muslims by painting an accurate picture about what is going on.\"\n\nThe updated version of the site includes only vague generalities about different types of \"violent extremism.\" Among various extremists listed are White Supremacists, Environmental extremists, Militia extremists, Religious extremists, and Anarchist extremists.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee passed a bill last week calling on the State Department to classify the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group. The bill lists CAIR, as well as two other Islamic groups - ISNA and NAIT - as organizations that are under the control of the international Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nUnder the bill, the Obama Administration would be forced to deny admittance to any foreign national tied to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Obama became President, people connected to the Muslim Brotherhood have received entry visas despite their open support for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nThe FBI website states that it is the FBI's responsibility to \"protect the nation from attacks by violent extremists. One important way to do that is to keep young people - the future of our country - from embracing violent extremist ideologies in the first place. This website is designed to help do just that.\"\n\nClarion notes, however, that \"without a clear explanation of the ideology behind Islamist terrorism, the FBI presents the problem as solely one of violence... Although the website mentions specific terrorist attacks including 9/11 as being carried out by al-Qaeda, it failed to name the specific ideology driving Islamist terrorist attacks worldwide.\"", "Power elites, blinded by hubris, intoxicated by absolute power, unable to set limits on their exploitation of the underclass, propelled to expand empire beyond its capacity to sustain itself, addicted to hedonism, spectacle and wealth, surrounded by half-witted courtiers -- Alan Greenspan, Thomas Friedman, David Brooks and others -- who tell them what they want to hear, and enveloped by a false sense of security because of their ability to employ massive state violence, are the last to know their privileged world is imploding.\n\n\"History,\" the Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto wrote, \"is the graveyard of aristocracies.\"\n\nThe carnival of the presidential election is a public display of the deep morbidity and artifice that have gripped American society. Political discourse has been reduced by design to trite patriotic and religious cliches, sentimentality, sanctimonious peons to the American character, a sacralization of militarism, and acerbic, adolescent taunts. Reality has been left behind.\n\nPoliticians are little more than brands. They sell skillfully manufactured personalities. These artificial personalities are used to humanize corporate oppression. They cannot -- and do not intend to -- end the futile and ceaseless wars, dismantle the security and surveillance state, halt the fossil fuel industry's ecocide, curb the predatory class of bankers and international financiers, lift Americans out of poverty or restore democracy. They practice anti-politics, or what Benjamin DeMott called \"junk politics.\" DeMott defined the term in his book \"Junk Politics: The Trashing of the American Mind\":\n\n\"It's a politics that personalizes and moralizes issues and interests instead of clarifying them. It's a politics that maximizes threats from abroad while miniaturizing large, complex problems at home. It's a politics that, guided by guesses about its own profits and losses, abruptly reverses public stances without explanation, often spectacularly bloating problems previously miniaturized (e.g.: Iraq will be over in days or weeks: Iraq is a project for generations). It's a politics that takes changelessness as its fundamental cause -- changelessness meaning zero interruption in the processes and practices that, decade after decade, strengthen existing, interlocking American systems of socioeconomic advantage. And it's a politics marked not only by impatience (feigned or otherwise) with articulated conflict and by frequent panegyrics on the American citizen's optimistic spirit and exemplary character, but by mawkish fondness for feel-your-pain gestures and idioms.\"\n\nHe went on: \"Great causes--they still exist--nourish themselves on firm, sharp awareness of the substance of injustice. Blunting that awareness is a central project of junk politics.\"\n\nOur constitutional democracy is dead. It does not work. Or rather, it does not work for us. No politician or elected official can alter anything of substance. Throughout the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama there has been complete continuity on nearly every issue. Indeed, if Obama has a legacy it is that he made things incrementally worse. He has accelerated the assault on civil liberties, expanded the imperial wars -- including empowering the government to order the assassination of American citizens -- and opened up new drilling sites on public lands as if he were Sarah Palin.\n\nHe has failed to rein in Wall Street, which is busy orchestrating another global financial meltdown, and turned our health care system over to rapacious corporations. He has made war on immigrants and overseen economic collapse among the poor, especially African-Americans. He appears to be powerless to shut down our torture center in Guantanamo -- a potent recruiting tool for jihadists -- or place a new justice on the Supreme Court. His successor will be as impotent.\n\nObama, now a charter member of our ruling elite, will become rich, as did the Clintons, when he leaves office. The moneyed elites will pay for his two presidential libraries -- grotesque vanity projects. They will put him on boards and lavish him with astronomical speaking fees. But as a democratic leader he has proved to be as pathetic as his predecessor.\n\n\"If the main purpose of elections is to serve up pliant legislators for lobbyists to shape, such a system deserves to be called 'misrepresentative or clientry government,'\" Sheldon Wolin wrote in \"Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Spector of Inverted Totalitarianism.\" \"It is, at one and the same time, a powerful contributing factor to the depoliticization of the citizenry, as well as reason for characterizing the system as one of anti-democracy.\"\n\n\"Managed Democracy,\" Wolin continued, \"is the application of managerial skills to the basic democratic political institution of popular elections. An election, as distinguished from the simple act of voting, has been reshaped into a complex production. Like all productive operations, it is ongoing and requires continuous supervision rather than continuing popular participation. Unmanaged elections would epitomize contingency: the managerial nightmare of control freaks. One method of assuring control is to make electioneering continuous, year-round, saturated with party propaganda, punctuated with the wisdom of kept pundits, bringing a result boring rather energizing, the kind of civic lassitude on which a managed democracy thrives.\"\n\nBernie Sanders, who at least acknowledges our economic reality and refuses to accept corporate money for his presidential campaign, plays the role of the Democratic Party's court jester. No doubt to remain a member of the court, he will not condemn the perfidy and collaboration with corporate power that define Obama, Hillary and Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party. He accepts that criticism of empire is taboo. He continues, even as the party elites rig the primaries against him, to make a mockery of democratic participation, to hold up the Democrats as a tool for change. He will soon be urging his supporters to vote for Hillary Clinton, actively working as an impediment to political mobilization and an advocate for political lethargy. Sanders, whose promise of a political revolution is as hollow as competing campaign slogans, will be rewarded for his duplicity. He will be allowed to keep his seniority in the Democratic caucus. The party will not mount a campaign in Vermont to unseat him from the U.S. Senate. He will not, as he has feared, end up a pariah like Ralph Nader. But he, like everyone else in the establishment, will have sold us out.\n\nThe whole election cycle is a carnival act, full of sound and fury and signifying nothing. It caters to the most venal instincts of the public. It is an example of the deep cynicism among elites who, like all other con artists, privately mock us for our gullibility and naivete. We are treated like malleable children. DeMott called out this infantilization, this \"babying of the electorate, spoiling of voter-age 'children' with year-round upbeat Christmas tales, the creation of a swelled-head citizenry, morally vain and irremediably sentimental.\" In the world of junk politics, he wrote, \"distinctions vanish between foundational democratic principles and decorative pleasurable tropes.\"\n\n\"The familiar apparatus of constitutional government and party organizations survives seemingly untouched,\" he wrote. \"In time, though, the language of justice and injustice comes to strike ordinary ears as Latinate and archaic -- due for interment -- and attachment to old forms weakens.\"\n\nNone of those elected to the White House, the Congress or statehouses have the power, and they know it, to challenge the corporate disemboweling of the country. The popular rage and frustration that have been rising against the established power elites during this election campaign will mount further as Americans, especially with a new president in the White House, realize that their voice and their vote are meaningless.", "Why do we change our ideological and political allegiances? Is it out of mere opportunism? Not necessarily, cautions Daniel Oppenheimer in Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century. That doesn't explain the personal torment and social ostracism some of us are willing to endure as a result. Genuine conviction? That's often a factor, but one that presumably also influenced our original allegiances and can't account for the timing of the metamorphosis. The answer, Oppenheimer argues, usually lies in the interplay between personal issues and wider sociopolitical circumstances at critical moments in our lives, a phenomenon that can generate a fundamental shift in belief.\n\nTo explore how such a sea change might affect not just the individual at its center but the course of history, Oppenheimer delves into the psycho-intellectual makeup of six people \"who reckoned with themselves at the most terrifyingly fundamental level\" and emerged from this crucible possessed of politico-ideological convictions at variance with, and sometimes even diametrically opposed to, those that had long galvanized them. While sympathetic to these figures, the author doesn't necessarily aim to validate their personal narratives (either before or after their metamorphoses), but rather to determine how and why they assumed the form they did. That such a project carries with it the risk of overreach is clear, and the obvious alternative would have been for Oppenheimer to restrict himself to analyzing our ideological wayfarers' intellectual arguments for or against this or that belief system. He does interrogate those arguments but also probes his subjects' tortured psyches in search of more visceral urges. After all, \"no man is the sum of his intellect.\"\n\nThe six (male) figures profiled here, five intellectuals and one politician, include Whittaker Chambers, a committed Communist and linchpin of a Soviet spy ring in the 1930s who, as a born-again Christian, would write the influential book \"Witness\" about his underground life; James Burnham, a Trotskyist leader who later served as a senior editor of the conservative magazine National Review; Ronald Reagan, the Hollywood actor with decidedly liberal leanings and a deep admiration for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt - stalwart Democrat and orchestrator of the New Deal - who would become a Republican icon as president; Norman Podhoretz, under whose decades-long stewardship Commentary magazine went from being left-liberal and countercultural to neoconservative, mirroring his own transformation; David Horowitz, the Marxist and Black Panther fellow traveler of the 1960s and '70s who morphed into a far-right cultural critic and author of the self-reproachful memoir \"Radical Son\"; and Christopher Hitchens, the British-born (non-doctrinaire) socialist and rapier-witted journalist who became a champion of US politico-military intervention against tyrannical regimes, foremost among them Saddam Hussein's in Iraq.\n\n\"Exit Right\" is the first book by Oppenheimer, who serves as director of strategic communications at the University of Texas at Austin. It emerges as powerful and self-assured, even when addressing the exceedingly complex matter of why we believe what we believe. Oppenheimer, who approaches this undertaking from a non-ideological standpoint, cautions that \"the grounds of our beliefs are more contingent than we could possibly ever account for.\" He nudges his readers to keep in mind certain salient features of human nature, as well as specific incidents that may well have impinged on his subjects' major life decisions.\n\nWould David Horowitz have stayed on the left if a colleague hadn't been killed by Horowitz's allies in the Black Panther Party?... Would Norman Podhoretz have turned to the right even if his good friend Norman Mailer had written an enthusiastic review of Podhoretz's memoir (\"Making It\") rather than the critical one Mailer did in fact write?... What if Ronald Reagan's movie career had been more successful, and he'd never gone to work for General Electric (where he fell under the spell of GE executive Lemuel Boulware's pro-free enterprise and anti-New Deal views)? Would he have remained the New Deal liberal he had been to that point?... Without the lever of the Iraq War would Christopher Hitchens have been separated from the left?\n\nOppenheimer guesses at the answers (and comes up with different ones). That's precisely his point; educated guesses are all we can manage.\n\nFascinatingly, however, it is during the unmoored \"in-between\" periods, \"when the bones of one's belief system are broken and poking out through the skin,\" that otherwise committed ideologues/apologists tend to produce their most insightful material. For, as the author explains, \"there's a certain kind of political writing and thinking that can be done only by someone who is in tension\" - a tension almost wholly absent when the subjects of this book were ensconced on either side of the left/right ideological divide.\n\nThat ideologically rigid readers (including reviewers) from both the left and right will find much to object to in this book is a given. Yet Oppenheimer, whose opinions reveal an incisive albeit non-dogmatic mind-set, nevertheless deserves some criticism. For example, his contention that Hitchens's rightward shift derived in part from a desired \"return to the family legacy of military valor and service to empire\" is a clear stretch. (Another conjecture, in which Oppenheimer guesses that Hitchens believed he now had \"a chance to see force deployed on the side of the downtrodden after so many years of writing furiously about force being applied against them,\" rings truer.)\n\nMeanwhile, the notion that Horowitz was among those who \"reshaped the American century,\" as the book's subtitle puts it, is fanciful if not absurd. Horowitz probably suffered more mental anguish over his choices as a leftist than the other figures discussed here combined. His story of disillusion with the Black Panthers and feelings of guilt over their apparent murder of his friend Betty Van Patter, whom he had steered toward their employ, is a searing one. But if anything, his move to the right (and further right, and then further yet) has proved so drastic that it has marginalized him. Horowitz, who is one of the two men Oppenheimer profiles who is alive today - the other being Podhoretz - doesn't just rail against hardcore leftists. Indeed, he has found new targets: liberals (Frontpage Mag, the webzine he founded, declares, \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out\") as well as Muslims, most if not all of whom he apparently considers extremists, a position that has earned him a spot on the Southern Poverty Law Center's \"Anti-Muslim Inner Circle.\"\n\nA more significant drawback is that Oppenheimer makes little effort to meld his material into a cohesive whole. Indeed, \"Exit Right\" is a collection of penetrating yet discrete character studies linked by an overall theme - leftists who turned to the right - as opposed to a single large-scale excavation of American political culture. The different circumstances and time frames in which Oppenheimer's subjects operated is doubtless one reason for this; their paths rarely crossed, though Burnham and Chambers - the latter briefly - would both end up writing for National Review, Reagan would be influenced by Chambers's \"Witness,\" and Hitchens would extol Burnham's book \"The Managerial Revolution.\" And with the full exception of Hitchens and the partial one of Reagan, the author takes his leave of each figure immediately following his final exhaustion as a leftist, yet before any decisive shift to the right.\n\nNevertheless, Oppenheimer teases out certain similarities between his subjects that serve to (loosely) hold the book together: a Manichean worldview that admits of little nuance (Hitchens - especially before his rightward shift - differed somewhat in this regard); a stern moralism; and a desire to embark on a heroic crusade for the forces of good and against those of evil. Such parallels might one day contribute to a broader study of radical politico-ideological metamorphoses in American culture. In the meantime, they help us in our quest to consider six otherwise disparate men collectively.\n\nPerhaps the most important commonality Oppenheimer traces is the desire to do something heroic - not because of vainglory but rather due to an underlying sense that one's generation or country or even the world is in pressing danger. This sometimes vague yet insistent feeling drove Chambers and Burnham to Communism, Hitchens to socialism, and Podhoretz to try to become the voice of an American generation. Even Horowitz, a \"red-diaper baby,\" didn't retain his Marxism into adulthood due to inertia but because he was consumed with a need \"to rescue Marxism from the mistakes his Communist Party parents and their comrades had so disastrously made,\" so that he might restore it to its proper trajectory.\n\nIdeological transformation did not diminish this somewhat messianic tendency. Chambers \"still felt the calling to fight for the redemption of humanity,\" but now that mission entailed fighting Communism. For Horowitz, it remained the case that \"the world had to change as a result of what he said and did,\" though by this time he had begun saying and doing very different things. And Reagan? He still wanted to save America, but by defeating global Communism and what he considered domestic manifestations of socialism. Hitchens remained just as motivated by his sympathy for certain long-beleaguered peoples - among them the Kurds in Iraq and other countries - but became convinced that US politico-military might could be harnessed to liberate them.\n\nInterestingly, whereas Chambers and Horowitz openly acknowledged their ideological about-faces, Podhoretz, Reagan, and - to a lesser extent - Hitchens attempted to obfuscate their transformations, instead claiming to have remained consistent. Reagan, for example, insisted that he hadn't changed - the Democratic Party had. Burnham adopted a middle-of-the-road interpretation of his personal journey, one that his writings as a Trotskyist largely bear out. While he admitted his move away from Marxism, he pointed to the fact that he'd long questioned some of its accompanying assumptions and had even called for jettisoning any of its much-vaunted \"scientific\" propositions that proved false when tested against empirical data.\n\nIn his brief yet powerful introduction, Oppenheimer urges readers \"to recognize that political belief, if we're to act on it, should be hard-earned. It should bear evidence of confrontation with the abyss.\" This is sound advice; but so that such soul-searching doesn't result in self-righteousness on our part should we subsequently come across people with questionable ideological allegiances, we might want to keep in mind that not everyone has engaged in that daunting \"confrontation with the abyss\" that (hopefully) disabused us of our own ingenuousness. This is the perfectly innocent explanation for why so many people do not renounce belief systems some of whose tenets they would find shocking were they to examine them.\n\nThat guy wearing the hammer and sickle T-shirt isn't about to subject us and our friends to a Stalinesque Great Purge, and it's doubtful that he embodies Marx's unsound doctrine. This should be obvious, but the realization nonetheless escapes some of us; witness our tendency to conflate adherent and ideology. Worse yet, if that ideology - as evidenced by its foundational texts - features belligerent material, we are often quick to conclude that most or all of its followers are willing to put into practice those violent teachings.\n\nGiven today's atmosphere of anti-Muslim hysteria, a good deal of which is whipped up by the likes of David Horowitz following terrorism committed by Muslims in the name of Islam, this is a problem. What to do? There are no easy answers. Nonetheless, we might start by absorbing the pithy yet profound lesson imparted by the title (if not necessarily the content) of a poem called \"I Am Not My Ideology,\" and take a moment to ponder the sobering reality that not all of us are willing to face the oftentimes terrifying abyss of which Oppenheimer writes.", "Is Latin America's leftist euphoria a thing of the past? After nearly two decades since the virus of 21st-century Socialism began to metastasize in Latin America, the weariness of the populist discourse by Fidel, Hugo and the like has become palpable. The economic results of the two countries leading this block are not inspiring others to follow their lead, so the growing trend among the rest is to discreetly shift to a democratic socialist model in which the word \"Communism\" is almost an obscenity.\n\nThe peoples of Latin America were seduced by leaders oozing nationalism, personal ambition, anti-imperialism and confused Marxist ideas totally divorced from reality, but who took advantage of favorable circumstances, promising more bread on the table, and education and health for all.\n\nIn the end the bread on the table is increasingly scarce, and the education and health for all are not free, but rather is paid for by the workers themselves. A big scam, as Peru's Eudocio Ravines would say, and all in exchange for giving up their freedom to some purportedly enlightened messiah. Socialism really turned out to be a bad deal.\n\nDefeated in the parliamentary elections in Venezuela, the presidential elections in Argentina and, finally, the referendum in Bolivia, the 21-century socialists are up against the ropes and about to throw in the towel. Not to mention Cuba, which makes false claims of growth even while nervously batting its eyelashes at its historical enemies to the north. Disarray amongst the Cuban ranks is rampant. \"Where are we headed?\" they wonder. They have not asked me, declares the former supreme leader, today a kind of tourist destination to be visited by Popes and presidents.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Maduro continues to increase wages, create unproductive state enterprises, and more ministries; that is, more corrupt bureaucracy. He considers these measures \"radicalizing the Socialist revolution.\" Another Cuba? Inflation, a lack of productivity, food shortages, black markets, corruption and crime are all that really grows as a result of these measures, as the former USSR demonstrated.\n\nIn Argentina leftist movements are struggling against the measures proposed by Mauricio Macri to redress all the waste and corruption under Kirchner, as union leaders, bureaucrats, hangers-on and other classes of revolutionary-Peronist-socialist louses, the great paladins of supposedly progressive ideas, want to continue culling from the public coffers.\n\nIn Bolivia, meanwhile, it looks like Evo Morales's time is up. Despite the strong results of his administration, another election is a bit too much. Cases of corruption in his immediate circle are coming to light. It is only natural for a sense of impunity to prevail and, even if it never became a dictatorship, the echelons of power would want more and more, the institutions would end up suffering, and the citizens would cease to be so, ending up as subjects of a leader and his party. Everything achieved by the Bolivian people in recent years would end with rationing cards and corrupt leaders.\n\nCommentators on Cuban television reveal how little they know about how the real world works, when they question the electoral systems in the countries that decide to abandon the shining path of Socialism. These commentators blame their favorites' loss of votes on right-wing campaigns, the pressure exerted by the empire, economic and media wars, international conspiracies and any other kind of silly justifications they can come up with. Finally, they confess that if the Left wants to stay in power it must put democratic mechanisms aside and follow the example of Cuba.\n\nThese ideas, characteristics of the political savagery advocated by the Cuban revolutionaries, are incompatible with these times, shaped by new computer and communications technologies. Totalitarianism, which is the proposal, has never been a solution to social problems anywhere in the world, be it right- or left-wing. Totalitarian regimes have always failed, because they run contrary to human nature. Without freedom there can be no development.\n\nThis is the main mistake of dictators, current and aspiring. If his policies are so great, and successful, then why must everything be focused on maintaining the president in power? Those who claim to represent the people do not actually believe that they are capable of not voting for them, which indicates how very arrogant they can be.", "Donald Trump is getting lots of flak for allegedly retweeting a Benito Mussolini quote -- after a Gawker journalist set an elaborate Twitter trap for him. The joke is on the mastermind of the sting operation: The phrase \"It's better to live a day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep\" did not in fact originate with the Italian dictator.\n\nTrump's anti-intellectualism is so in-your-face that people who consider themselves intellectuals are affronted. They like to fact-check Trump to show how ignorant he is.\n\nThe story everywhere, from The New York Times to the BBC, and even in Italian papers, is that Trump tweeted a Mussolini quote:\n\nAfter this tweet appeared, Gawker let it be known that its senior writer Ashley Feinberg had created the Twitter account @ilduce2016 in December specifically to tweet Mussolini quotes at Trump in the hope that he would retweet one. The tactic paid off. Gawker's Alex Pareene wrote:\n\nAt the time of the account's creation, Gawker Media Executive Editor John Cook expressed some concern that the joke behind the account was far too obvious, and wouldn't trick anyone but a complete idiot. Today, Donald Trump proved him -- and all of us -- right.\n\nI can't laugh with Gawker and the rest of the media that reported on the Trump retweet.\n\nTime Magazine attributed the quote to Mussolini in a story published on August 2, 1943. It appeared on some Italian coins during Mussolini's rule. But it's actually a proverb from Emilia Romagna, the region of Italy where Mussolini was born. The proverb entered the political lexicon after an Italian soldier wrote it on the wall of a building in Sant'Andrea del Piave in 1918, during the Battle of the Piave. The Austro-Hungarian army attacked Gerneral Armando Diaz's Italian troops on the banks of that river in Northern Italy and failed miserably. The Austrian defeat was one of the final nails in the ailing empire's coffin and a proud moment for Italy. The bit of wall carrying the graffiti is preserved at the Fagare della Bataglia memorial.\n\nTrump, of course, had no idea whether it was a Mussolini quote, a bit of wartime graffiti or an Italian proverb. It probably didn't even register with him that the account which tweeted the quote at him was called \"ilduce\" -- or he didn't understand the Italian. \"It's a very good quote,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I didn't know who said it, but what difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else -- it's a very good quote.\"\n\nIn a strange way, he's right. The proverb was strong enough to stand as a populist slogan, so Mussolini used it. So did Trump, with his instinctive sense of political soundbite.\n\nThis is not about Trump's ignorance -- or the failure of some journalists to research the quote before shooting it at the republican front-runner. It's not even about Trump's allegedly fascist views: The quote doesn't espouse racism or totalitarianism. I'm not even sure Trump holds any views at all -- at least not for much longer after words leave his mouth. He does, however, know what words will resonate with people who are angry and tired of losing. That's why it doesn't matter to his voters where his quotes or stories like the Pershing one come from.\n\nTrump doesn't use language to communicate information. He uses it to elicit emotion. His utterances are weaponised sound, not speech. Information is complex, and knowledge is spotty on all sides. Emotion dressed up as information is simple and powerful. Fact-checking is simply extraneous to what's going on.\n\nEvery society has a number of people who react to such signals. When they are the majority, an unscrupulous politician can use it and set up a nasty regime.

Reality has been left behind.\n\nPoliticians are little more than brands. They sell skillfully manufactured personalities. These artificial personalities are used to humanize corporate oppression. They cannot -- and do not intend to -- end the futile and ceaseless wars, dismantle the security and surveillance state, halt the fossil fuel industry's ecocide, curb the predatory class of bankers and international financers, lift Americans out of poverty or restore democracy. They practice anti-politics, or what Benjamin DeMott called \"junk politics.\" DeMott defined the term in his book \"Junk Politics: The Trashing of the American Mind\":\n\nIt's a politics that personalizes and moralizes issues and interests instead of clarifying them. It's a politics that maximizes threats from abroad while miniaturizing large, complex problems at home. It's a politics that, guided by guesses about its own profits and losses, abruptly reverses public stances without explanation, often spectacularly bloating problems previously miniaturized (e.g.: Iraq will be over in days or weeks: Iraq is a project for generations). It's a politics that takes changelessness as its fundamental cause -- changelessness meaning zero interruption in the processes and practices that, decade after decade, strengthen existing, interlocking American systems of socioeconomic advantage. And it's a politics marked not only by impatience (feigned or otherwise) with articulated conflict and by frequent panegyrics on the American citizen's optimistic spirit and exemplary character, but by mawkish fondness for feel-your-pain gestures and idioms.\n\nHe went on: \"Great causes -- they still exist -- nourish themselves on firm, sharp awareness of the substance of injustice. Blunting that awareness is a central project of junk politics.\"\n\nOur constitutional democracy is dead. It does not work. Or rather, it does not work for us. No politician or elected official can alter anything of substance. Throughout the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama there has been complete continuity on nearly every issue. Indeed, if Obama has a legacy it is that he made things incrementally worse. He has accelerated the assault on civil liberties, expanded the imperial wars -- including empowering the government to order the assassination of American citizens -- and opened up new drilling sites on public lands as if he were Sarah Palin. He has failed to rein in Wall Street, which is busy orchestrating another global financial meltdown, and turned our health care system over to rapacious corporations. He has made war on immigrants and overseen economic collapse among the poor, especially African-Americans.

Even by the Elizabethan era, it seems, a discipline that had begun in classical times as a practical method for discerning how best to live life had devolved into something increasingly hermetic. Wind the clock forward, to the late 19th century, and philosophy had become an exclusively academic profession, focused on seemingly arcane questions of aesthetics, epistemology, and ethics.\n\nThe 20th century, improbably, changed all that. The Great War, the sweeping away of imperial dynasties, waves of technological revolutions, a worldwide economic collapse, the rise of global totalitarianism, World War II, the atom bomb, the Cold War -- all these events destroyed cultural certainties and introduced bewilderment and anxiety. And it was philosophy -- as a means of understanding who we are, why the world is as it is, what we ought to do -- that came to the rescue.\n\nOr at least that's the message of At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9, the sprightly, elegant, occasionally unsatisfying new book by Sarah Bakewell, author of the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award-winning How to Live, or, A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer. It was the existentialists, among them Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and their cousins and precursors the phenomenologists, led by the seminal Czech thinker Edmund Husserl, who abandoned preconceptions to look at things -- all things -- exactly as they are. In doing so, they showed us that although \"there is no traced-out path to lead man to his salvation,\" as Sartre would put it, this absence of models frees us to invent ourselves, and our world, every day. Such thinking transformed the post-World War II era, says Bakewell, opening dialogue about race, gender, and exploitation; and although \"the story of existentialism is [that] ... of a whole European century,\" it's also the story of the individuals who \"inhabited their historical and personal world, as they inhabited their ideas.\"\n\nTaking her cue from Iris Murdoch, the philosopher-novelist who wrote the first book-length study of Sartre, Bakewell announces in her first chapter that she wants to tell this story by combining philosophical exegesis and biography: to \"look in through the windows of a philosophy\" -- existentialism and phenomenology -- \"and see how people occupy it.\" She begins her tale promisingly, with three philosophers walking into a bar on the rue du Montparnasse in Paris: the elegant, well-born Beauvoir; \"her boyfriend, Jean-Paul Sartre, a round-shouldered twenty-seven-year-old with downturned grouper lips, a dented complexion, prominent ears, and eyes that pointed in different directions\"; and \"Sartre's debonair old school friend Raymond Aron.\" (Bakewell has a gift for vivid thumbnail sketches.) Aron describes to the others a new way of thinking, fashionable in Berlin, called phenomenology. \"If you are a phenomenologist,\" he says, \"you can talk about this cocktail and make philosophy out of it.\" And Sartre -- and Bakewell -- are off and running to Germany, where after a lightning flashback to discuss proto-existentialists Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, the author introduces us to Husserl, his student and surrogate son Martin Heidegger (\"shy, tiny, black-eyed, with a pinched little mouth ... [and] a mysterious power over others\"), Heidegger's student and sometime lover Hannah Arendt, his rival Ernst Cassirer, and his friend Karl Jaspers. Then it's back to France, to focus on Sartre and Beauvoir, their charming and urbane comrade Maurice Merleau-Ponty, their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and frenemy Albert Camus, and a host of others, from the jazz existentialist Boris Vian to the American novelist (and one-time candidate for mayor of New York on an \"existentialist\" ticket) Norman Mailer -- all of whom are limned in a series of deft portraits and sparkling anecdotes enlivened by apposite illustrations studded through the text.\n\nUnfortunately, the interconnected narrative promised by Bakewell's titular metaphor only intermittently materializes. At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9 often reads more like a series of loosely linked stories about vaguely connected people. Even where a narrative arc seems implicit, as in the varying ways her subjects responded to the challenges of their century -- the widowed (and Jewish) Malvine Husserl trying to smuggle her late husband's papers out of Nazi Germany, Heidegger's postwar breakdown and philosophical reorientation, or Sartre's rupture with both Camus and Merleau-Ponty over his stubborn allegiance to Soviet communism -- Bakewell tends to favor a more episodic structure. Discursiveness served Bakewell charmingly in How to Live, where her 20 essayistic chapters functioned as \"twenty attempts at an answer\" to the question -- how to live? -- posed by her single subject, Michel de Montaigne. It seems less effective when dealing with a cast of 79.\n\nIn addition, the windowpanes of Bakewell's Murdochian nonfiction novel occasionally fog up with lengthy explications of philosophical constructs like Zuhandenheit (readiness-to-hand), Dasein and Mitsein (being and being-with), proprioception, and the like, which she explicates and then reexplicates as if she were afraid she hadn't made things clear the first time -- a penchant that manages to confound rather than clarify. One is reminded of Gertrude Stein's description of \"a village explainer, excellent if you were a village, but if you were not, not.\"\n\nBakewell herself seems to sense the problem, without fully grasping the solution. \"When I first read Sartre and Heidegger, I didn't think the details of a philosopher's personality or biography were important,\" she says in her concluding chapter. \"I intoxicated myself with concepts, without taking account of their relationship to events and to all the odd data of their inventors' lives. Never mind lives; ideas were the thing.\n\n\"Thirty years later, I have come to the opposite conclusion.\"\n\nOn the evidence of At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9, she is still struggling to make this change. But like her description of Heidegger's postwar philosophical readjustment, or Kehre (turn), which she compares to the action of \"a man in a field who gradually becomes aware of the movement of the breeze in the wheat behind him, and turns to listen,\" her effort is often beautiful to witness.", "The findings of the prematurely concluded Rodney Commission of Inquiry should not come as a surprise. Those findings are no different from what has long been known in Guyana: that Forbes Burnham and the then Guyana military were involved in the death of Dr. Walter Rodney.\n\nThe premature end to the inquiry disallowed the Commissioners, all respected jurists, to probe deeper and to make rulings about who distributed guns to the enemies of the Working People's Alliance, Rodney's party. The fact that the Commission had to fold up its work so quickly precluded the continued cross- examination or recall of some witnesses.\n\nThe Commission had deferred testimony from a former Crime Chief since they wanted to be able to question him on the totality of the evidence received rather than calling him and then have to call him back to be questioned again on some evidence which would have been given subsequent to his first time on the stand.\n\nThere have been, predictably, attempts to attack the credibility of the Commission. The Commission did explain, lengthily, the reasons for the adoption of flexibility in terms of the nature of evidence. Those explanations are now conveniently being ignored.\n\nThe flexibility was necessary because of the lengthy duration between the death of Rodney and the convening of the Commission of Inquiry. But excuses have to be found and attempts made to discredit the report of the Commissioners and to impugn their integrity. Those are old political tricks that are practiced in Guyana. They fool no one.\n\nLaying the blame on state violence is an attempt at whitewashing the findings of the Commission and reducing the effect of the impact of the findings of the COI on the reputation of Burnham and the PNC. It is an attempt to say that it is not the PNC or Burnham who were the problem but it was state violence. This is an attempt to exculpate the PNC and Burnham from blame for Rodney's death. There will be more such attempts in the future.\n\nThe problem is not simply state violence. Rodney's death was caused by a state that was malformed.\n\nThe state that killed Rodney was a specific type of state that has known no parallel either before or after - and this includes the so-called criminalized state that was said to have existed under the PPP.\n\nThe state was a militarized state. There was no latent external threat to the State. The Protocol of Port of Spain had neutralized any physical threat from Venezuela. Yet the military and paramilitary agencies of the State were being expanded. Why because force was needed to keep people in check.\n\nThe state in Guyana was a subsidiary state. It was inferior to the ruling party. Public officials were required to swear loyalty to the ruling party. Party officials used to run roughshod over government ministries. The party card was more influential than academic qualifications in obtaining a job in the state sector. The party itself had declared itself superior and above the state.\n\nThe state was an undemocratic state. Elections were blatantly and shamelessly rigged. The option for democratic change was therefore made non- existent.\n\nDemocratic expression was suppressed. Radio was exclusively controlled by the state. There were no private daily newspapers. Criticisms of the government were muted and met with violent suppression.\n\nThe state was an authoritarian state. There were similar states in Latin America. It was moving towards becoming a totalitarian state but this collapsed in 1985 when Burnham died.\n\nThe state was in crisis. The PNC introduced two new industrial relations new concepts: redeployment and retrenchment.\n\nOne meant that if you were an office worker you were transferred to do blue- collar work. The other was a nice way of telling you that you were dismissed. There was mass retrenchment and constructive dismissals through redeployment.\n\nThe state had no food. Guyanese had long been accustomed to standing in lines for food items since the early 1970's. But by the time Rodney returned to Guyana things had begun to get worse. The lines were longer and were for more items. Horse guards had to be deployed to control the public. What is happening in Venezuela today is a joke to what Guyanese went through prior to and after Rodney's death.\n\nThe state was being emptied. Recently declassified documents by the United States point to the fact that the US embassy in Guyana was extremely concerned about the steep rise in non- immigrant visas in 1978, two years prior to the death of Walter Rodney.\n\nThese documents suggested that the Canadians and British consulates were under similar pressure. There was a mass exodus of persons from Guyana in those days.\n\nRodney's death was not just about state violence. Violence was the means by which a deformed state propped itself up from threats. Rodney was a victim of malformed state, the PNC state of 1966.", "Two centuries ago, the Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich astutely observed: \"Asia begins at the Landstrasse.\" Nations east of this Viennese street, were already exhibiting parochial undercurrents that were contrarian to Western thought. This fault-line remains with modified contours, exacerbated by the trifecta of EU failures in its immigration, economic and foreign policies.\n\nEastern Europe refuses to drown with its Western half in that cesspit of totalitarian multiculturalism, and will inevitably gravitate towards Greater Eurasia. The West-facilitated Nazification of Ukraine and the Baltic nations is not going to stop this process.\n\nSamuel P. Huntington's \"civilizational\" treatise therefore appears flawed as it emphasized religion over identity. In reality, the tectonic plates of extant civilizations rarely grate with seismic effects.\n\nExtant civilizations have unique characteristics. They are inheritors of identities forged in situ since ancient times. They are led by nation-states or \"civilization-states\" that quietly cooperate, not clash, in post-modern times of peril. Barring game-changing wildcards, this is the 21st century reality.\n\nIn terms of longevity, Greater Eurasia's civilization-states include China and India (5,000-years-old), Iran and Israel (4,000 years), Japan (3,000 years) and Russia (1,000 years). All other nations within Greater Eurasia are adjuncts, bridges or melting pots created by some of these ancient states. Japan and Israel however are standalone civilizations, with the latter having suffered a two-millennium gap in its existence.\n\nCivilizations welcome globalization but counterbalance it with sovereignty. The New World Order may be stamped on the US dollar and enthused by the West, but it remains a civilizational anathema and a global pipedream.\n\nSo, while the EU - a political construct - slowly disintegrates, Greater Eurasia continues to build. China and Iran recently revived their ancient Silk Road links via a new rail network on Feb 15. India and China are increasing cooperation despite unresolved border issues. Russia, China and India are subtly bridging the antagonistic chasm between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe geographic swath from Iran to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Israel may in fact constitute the future south-western flank of Greater Eurasia. It might take 5, 10 or 20 years, suffer one setback or another, but it may happen. All these nations are either multi-ethnic or have large constituents of ancient minorities living within their borders. For the time being, both Iran and Israel have little choice but to neutralize the so-called Islamic State that is inimical to all identities except its own. Using the civilizational paradigm here, Israel will only war with Iran if Tel Aviv continues to be a political vassal of the Greater Eurabian enterprise.\n\nThere is a growing corpus of literature on Greater Eurasia but what of Greater Eurabia? Geographically, it begins at the gates of the Sunni bastions of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and includes the entire Western world on the wrong side of the Landstrasse. Turkey, with its pan-Turkic dreams stretching all the way to Xinjiang, can count itself as a founding member. Afghanistan and Pakistan (AfPak) are effectively adjuncts of Greater Eurabia as religion overrides ethnicity and identity. In this regard, Huntington's thesis is applicable to Greater Eurabia, where Soldiers of Odin face off with Soldiers of Allah in Norwegian streets.\n\nGreater Eurabia has no extant civilization-states. It has two power-axes wielded in Washington and Riyadh, reflecting US neo-conservatism and Wahhabi medievalism. Pundits simplify the West-Gulf Arab security alliance as one underpinned by oil and petrodollars. However, there is more to this, in term of shared core values. Think of the 200 mosques that Saudi Arabia callously offered to build when Germany begged it to accommodate refugees who were dislodged by Riyadh's religious wars? Germany, however, is allowed to lord over Europe as long as it reflects Washington's interests.\n\nGreater Eurabia therefore functions on a rigid pecking order, where the poor get poorer and the 1 percent gets richer. Yet, no other alliance gets frothy over \"peace\" or \"international law\" but thrives on war or terror at the same time. It groups itself either under inflexible ideology (i.e. EU and NATO) or inflexible religion (i.e. GCC core of the Sunni Crescent).\n\nBoth axes have their own irreconcilable visions of a borderless world. One is marked by \"free markets,\" \"freedom\" and \"free what-nots\" while the other longs for a reincarnated Caliphate. Wars are waged, and revolutions fomented, for these ideals. While these antithetical visions ironically clash in the West, they synergize at confluences like Syria, creating illegitimate offspring like the so-called Islamic State or Daesh.\n\nDaesh, ironically, amplifies the core values both axes were founded on, namely that of genocide and slavery. The United States and the Arab world were undeniably forged by ethnoreligious cleansing and slave labour. To mask their dark provenances and inject delusions of grandeur and divine destiny into their brainwashed subjects, both axes resort to an ever morphing narrative replete with new bogeymen. Daesh exemplifies this fluid rebranding, with itself having metamorphosed from \"moderate rebels\" to the \"Free Syrian Army\" to ISIL, ISIS, the Islamic State and finally the neutral-sounding Daesh in the mainstream Western media.\n\nWestern journalism, like its history, is a pack of lies. Inversions of reality are regularly re-cast in stone as facts. This is best exemplified by its Eurabian half's paradoxical worldview of more peaceful lands as the Dar-ul-Harb or \"Abode of War.\" The Arab world never sees itself or its Western allies as the embodiment of that term. But then Greater Eurabia is like a juvenile delinquent who refuses to grow up or introspect. It is always the latest bogeyman's fault. Europe's refugee crisis is conveniently pinned on Russia while China takes the blame for the ongoing global economic slowdown.\n\nEuropeans, unable to defend their women and children from physical violations in the hands of incoming refugees, antagonize Russia over Crimea. Americans, who can hardly protect their children from everyday violence, spree shootings and mass-mediated sexualisation, have developed this paroxysmal itch to save Southeast Asians from a supposed \"Chinese aggression\" in the South China Sea.\n\nWestern officials are already expressing fears that the EU may \"completely breakdown in 10 days.\" In other words, this very week -- the first Ides of March 2016! A rather apocalyptic and alarmist prognosis for sure, but it does echo with the growing pessimism of EU leaders like Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.\n\nIn the final analysis, Greater Eurabia will crash under the weight of its contradictions. Apart from shared destructive values, both axes mutually repel each other in all other areas. They do not even answer nature's call the same way. When Germany introduced bidet toilets for its immigrant hordes, the move was couched in universal terms. Creators of this civilizational innovation, Global Fliegenschmidt, branded it as \"Universally applicable: the refugee toilet is ideal for the globalised defecation.\"\n\n\"Globalized defecation\" is coincidentally the perfect metaphor and destiny of Greater Eurabia.", "The last refuge of people who are freaking out about the #NeverTrump movement is the idea that, if Trump is nominated, it will be important to let Donald Trump pick Scalia's replacement (and presumably at least one other SCOTUS justice, given the age and health condition of the current occupants of the bench). Cue Hugh Hewitt:\n\nWith all due respect to Hugh, this particular scare tactic (which is doubtless effective with respect to almost literally any other Republican) just doesn't hold water with respect to Trump. Based on Trump's own pronouncements, his judicial philosophy is easily worse than Hillary's, and I don't even have to bring his remarks about his radical pro-abortion sister into this to prove the point.\n\nThe last 8 years have demonstrated that the key fight in the Supreme Court right now is the fight over the proper scope of Executive power. Obama has shown the path for future Presidents who want to disregard Congress and unilaterally pass laws on their own. The only thing even sort of keeping Obama in check at this point is the Supreme Court's willingness to rule his increasingly breathtaking power grabs unconstitutional.\n\nAs much as Obama has attempted to arrogate to himself the constitutional authority of the Legislative branch, he is an absolute piker compared to Donald Trump's own public statements on the matter.\n\nFor instance, however bad Hillary Clinton's judicial philosophy might be, it isn't bad enough to think to say this shockingly totalitarian thing in public:\n\nThis statement, though, is really of a kind with dozens more like it on the campaign trail in which anyone who dares to challenge Trump's authority to do anything is met with threats.\n\nTrump has literally never on the campaign trail expressed a belief that the power of the executive - as wielded by him - should be limited in any way. While he's made vague mention of Obama's unconstitutional executive orders, he's not attacked them for the fact that they're unconstitutional abuses of power, but rather only that they're wrong on policy. You never hear Trump say - as both Cruz and Rubio do - that even if they agreed with Obama on the policy, the President simply doesn't have the power to do what Obama has done.\n\nMoreover, Trump's signature statement on the campaign trail, his idiotic assertion that he will make Mexico pay for the wall by starting a trade war with Mexico, illustrates a total disregard for Congress's clear and exclusive power to regulate foreign trade, as set forth in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Like roughly 90% of the things Trump promises, his policy cannot be accomplished without a gross abuse of power.\n\nTrump himself admitted during the last debate that he thinks judges \"sign bills,\" and after the last debate he also admitted that he wouldn't really know where to begin in terms of what questions to ask to make sure that any judge he nominated was conservative. You can bet, however, that the first time the Supreme Court tells him that he \"can't\" do something that he wants to do, he will immediately begin asking all his judicial nominees, \"Hey, let's say I wanted to do X. Would you vote to stop me?\"\n\nIf you want to convince conservatives to vote for Trump, you're going to have to come with better material than scaring us about SCOTUS justices. Because the type of person Trump would nominate would be even more frightening to conservative sensibilities than whoever Hillary might dig up.", "By Madeline Crabb\n\nA plague has overtaken the land - the plague of political correctness. This disease infects the body through lies, deception, and manipulation. It has been ravaging us for nearly 100 years, and has caused immense damage. The end result of this disease is total destruction of the body - our nation.\n\nWhile America is not yet totally destroyed, end-term symptoms include base, depraved, and condemned minds. (Rom. 1: 28 NIV and AMP) The Aramaic Bible in Plain English puts it this way: \"And when they thought in themselves that they were wise, they became insane.\" Indeed, it seems that the entire world has lost its collective mind, but most of this column concerns the United States.\n\nThe majority of average, everyday, hard-working, mind-their-own-business Americans understand what we're discussing here. The so-called leaders in our nation, and particularly those within the Federal Government, refuse to listen to our mutual wisdom. We the People operate our daily lives under what's now considered an archaic concept of common sense. But said leaders have personal agendas to fulfill that are in opposition to common-sense ideals. Therefore, America stands on the precipice of total destruction.\n\nWhat has thus far sustained us from harm is our foundation on, belief in, and reliance upon God. Our founding/governing documents and laws, which are based on biblical standards and beliefs attest to this foundation. But alas, the politically-correct, wiser-than-the-rest-of-us elitists have overridden, re-written, or undermined our laws, and simultaneously beaten down the masses to gain control over us. The control is not yet complete, but the enemies of freedom, those individuals We the People have elected to serve us, have become our masters.\n\nIn my last column we discussed how America is already a socialistic system - at least culturally. If Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton are elected to the presidency, we will likely become economically socialistic, if not full-blown communist. (Of course, redistribution of wealth, a basic principle of socialism, has been the modus operandi within our system since the 1930's.) Sanders is a communist and espouses communist ideas. Do the research. Start with the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Then acquaint yourself with the Communist Takeover of America: 45 Declared Goals (Congressional Record, 1963.) Http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1561529/posts.\n\nHillary is also a communist, but won't show her true colors until she is certain she won't be prosecuted for her crimes, perhaps because of a pardon by the sitting socialist/communist president. The goal for America by the Democrat presidential candidates is NOT a Constitutional/Representative Republic. But the opposing Republican Party isn't much different. Leadership by so-called conservatives has not stopped our societal disintegration.\n\nAs previously stated, this process has been ongoing for nearly a century. Political correctness (PC) is not a new concept. It is cultural Marxism. Today we will be discussing the roots.\n\nBasically, cultural Marxism was necessary when it became clear that the working class would not bring about revolution against Western society, and thus usher in communist utopia. Followers of Karl Marx formed a \"think tank\" to discover alternative ways to bring about the revolution. In 1924, based on the Marx/Engel Institute in Russia, the Institute for Social Research was founded in Frankfort, Germany, and was often simply referred to as the Frankfort School. The founders wanted to call this think tank the Institute for Socialism, but thought it best to hide their true purpose. Deception from its inception! With the rise of the Nazis, and because the members of the Institute were all socialists and mostly Jewish, the founders were forced to flee Germany. Frankfort School was relocated to New York City where it was then affiliated with Columbia University. (Sound familiar? Obama learned many of his socialist/communist ideas at that school.)\n\nOne of the main concepts developed by the Institute was that of critical theory (CT). Conservative columnist/teacher Bill Lind, who has done extensive study of cultural Marxism/political correctness (PC), explains that the theory of CT is: to criticize. It's \"unrelenting, destructive criticism of every institution of western society in the hopes of bringing that society down.\" David Horowitz of the Freedom Center says that CT attempted to politicize logic itself. CT is the basis for all the black, gay, women's, gender, radical feminism, native American, and other popular leftist studies in colleges that have turned campuses into what Bill Lind calls ivy-covered North Koreas. What's now being taught is an ideology, not historical fact, and leads to totalitarianism.\n\nLind further explains that economic Marxism is \"determined by ownership of the means of production,\" but with cultural Marxism, \"all history is determined by power. Which groups, defined by race, sex, etc., have power over which other groups? Nothing else matters.\" Additionally, he states that all literature, everything in the past is about that one thing: power. In what is essentially a re-writing of history, PC dictates that \"certain groups are good - feminist women and only feminist women, (non-feminists are deemed not to exist) blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, and various other groups are determined to be victims and therefore are good, regardless of what any of them do. And similarly, white males are determined automatically to be evil.\"\n\nContinuing, Lind explains that both forms of Marxism have a method of analysis. With classic Marxism, it is economics. With cultural Marxism, it is deconstruction, which \"removes all meaning from text and reinserts whatever meaning they so desire.\" Again, as previously mentioned, this is a rewriting of history, even a re-defining of the Bible. Taking it a bit further, it is a re-writing of our language, a re-defining of words.\n\nAnother concept developed by one of the most influential members of the Institute, Herbert Marcuse, is that of liberating tolerance. Marcuse believed that our free American society was actually a deception, and that true tolerance was somehow repressive. Consequently, he did what the Left is now so famous for - he redefined the terms. Liberating tolerance is total intolerance for any viewpoint but its own. It is intolerant of any ideas from the Right, and tolerant for any ideas from the Left. Martin Jay, professor of history at University of California, Berkley, says that this form of thinking could be used by the Left to deny free speech to those who disagree with them. Hmm...Does this sound familiar?\n\nTheodor Adorno was yet another socialist in this PC movement who believed that Americans possess many fascist traits and that anyone who supported traditional American culture was psychologically unbalanced. So today, particularly on college campuses, it is normal for people to label their opponents on any given subject as fascists, and to suggest these opponents are in need of psychological treatment in the form of sensitivity training. Many businesses are now conducting such training on people who are found to be \"politically incorrect.\"\n\nWith all this radical thought being thrust upon us, where might the sexual revolution fit in? Many believe it began in the 1960's, but was actually birthed in the 1930's in part by radical Marxist and psychoanalyst Erich Fromm. According to Lind, Fromm pioneered the concept of sexual liberation and gender politics. He believed that \"masculinity and femininity were not reflections of essential sexual differences, but were derived instead from differences in life functions which were in part socially determined.\" Sex and sexual differences were merely \"constructs.\" (concepts) However, it was Herbert Marcuse that introduced Fromm's beliefs, mixed in with a little Sigmund Freud, to the 60's culture. Marcuse \"condemned all restrictions on sexual behavior, calling instead for polymorphous perversity, his definition of the future they want to create.\" He had some extreme beliefs on the need for sexual liberation, and wrote Eros and Civilization, what was the \"bible\" of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the 60's.\n\nFurther, Marcuse believed that repression is the essence of a capitalist order, which then produces people Freud described as having hang-ups and neuroses because of repressed sexual instincts. So then, if an individual's \"eros and libido\" can be liberated, the result is a polymorphous perverse society in which \"you can do your own thing in a world where (by the way) there will no longer be any work.\" Marcuse coined the phrase: \"Make love not war.\" He encouraged youth to \"do your own thing; if it feels good, do it.\" And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nPolitical correctness is NOT a minor thing. It isn't simply about not offending someone else with our speech or behavior. It is a systematic brainwashing of American society through the lies, deception, and manipulation by people devoted to Marxist ideology. In fact, political correctness is an ideology unto itself. The end goal is to completely destroy our society. And as Bill Whittle of PJ TV has stated, it is a philosophy that has killed no less than 100 million people worldwide. Will America and Americans be the next victims? We are well on our way along that path of destruction. Therefore, we must learn the truth about this vile enemy, and then fight against it, which we will delve into next time.\n\nFor my fellow Christians, you already know the solution to political correctness, right? We should honor our Lord and speak Truth, in love, to every person, and in every situation. We will many times be reviled for doing so, but Jesus warned us that this would happen, and that we are actually blessed when the world reviles us. (1 Pet. 4:14) So, let's be obedient to God, and hopefully there will be multitudes changed through our obedience. Furthermore, let's also pray this PC plague can be stopped before it kills us. To anyone willing to hear....\n\n\u00a9 Madeline Crabb", "We are in the official Trump panic period. The punditocracy and the Republican establishment are mystified. For a while now, the pundits have floundered around, unable to explain Trump's popularity and why his supporters stick with him even after he has broken virtually every cardinal rule of politics: attacking war heroes, popular women, and even the Pope, all the while staying on top of the polling heap, giving a whole new meaning to the nickname \"Teflon Don\" (which was originally coined for Mafia boss John Gotti, to whom charges never seemed to stick).\n\nNow, the pundits and the Republican \"leaders\" and right-wing editorial writers are all pleading with these same voters to have the good sense to reject the guy with all the firepower. After years of Fox and the establishment making Trump into a huge media star - some version of America's collective brand of id -- they now want people to vote for Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio... mostly Rubio. Really? They think this is going to work? At least Hillary has a brand... shaky as it is. But it seems that Trump's base of support is pretty solid. The proverbial horses have already left the barn.\n\nThe punditocracy and the GOP establishment don't understand why people are not listening to them -- why the voters do not get it. They can't just chalk voter attitudes up to irrational racism; the pundits are unrealistically committed to rational thinking.\n\nBut, hello. Voting like many other human activities is emotional not rational. The fact is that people have been voting against their own rational self interest for a long time. The secret to Trump's appeal lies in emotions borne out of fear and anger; it's not a rational one that can be explained away with pragmatic pleading about future destruction and preserving the existence of Republican Party. That doesn't cut it. Many people feel like their lives have already been destroyed.\n\nThe Trump Brand\n\nHave all these hand wringers thought about the fact that Trump has by far the most powerful brand in this presidential race? Ours is a society where brand is king, as Nike, Apple, Google or, for that matter, Beyonce and Jay Z can attest. Trump's is a brand which ironically took his bullying style to such iconic status that when anyone thinks of the once generic words: \"You're fired,\" they think of Donald Trump. It's as if he owns the phrase.\n\nTrump's success as a candidate is not magical, despite the inability of pundits to either grasp it or anticipate its power. It has been a long time in the making -- decades. Its ingredients include Trump's essential bullying nature, of Fox and the rest of the media enabling him over many years, of his celebrity status built on the 14-year run of \"The Apprentice,\" combined with the economic insecurity tens of millions of people feel every day and their constant bombardment with messages of fear -- over the course of the 15 years since 9-11 - leaving many voters infantilized, and ready to turn to a \"strongman.\"\n\nTrump's Long Run for President\n\nTrump seems to have been planning this presidential run since he ran for president in 2012, which many people don't seem to remember. But actually the Trump presidential gambit goes back 28 years to 1988 when a GOP activist, unhappy with the candidatures started a draft Trump movement, perhaps planting the earliest seeds. In 2000, he quit the Republicans saying they \"were too crazy right,\" and contemplated running on New York's Independence Party line. In the end, he opted out of running against Pat Buchanan for the nod, saying ironically about Buchanan: \"He's a Hitler lover, I guess he's an anti-Semite,\" on Meet the Press. \"He doesn't like the blacks, he doesn't like the gays.\" He was talking about running again in 2004, but launched his highly successful Apprentice series instead. Then came 2012, the real movement builder. Prior to 2012 presidential race. Trump had gained increased notoriety for questioning President Obama's citizenship (claims that were false) and had indicated he was serious about seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Obama's re-election bid. \"America is missing quality leadership,\" he said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011. \"I am well acquainted with winning.\" He disputed notions that his favorable standing in polls was simply a product of name recognition and not his proposals, telling USA TODAY: \"Something resonates with people; people know I'm a serious person.\"\n\nIn the end Trump stepped aside citing his love for business, and saying he was not ready to leave the private sector. Looking back on the 2012 campaign-that-wasn't in an interview with The Des Moines Register in January, The Donald had some regrets. \"I would've won the race against Obama. He would've been easy,\" he said.\n\nTrump and the Media\n\nTrump dominates and is often fawned over by the same media that is now so panicked about him. They have enabled and perpetuated his messages. He built part of the foundation of this presidential campaign with his long-running anti-Obama birther claims. Though these claims had no factual basis, Fox and other conservative and even mainstream media dutifully provided the platform that validated many people's irrational fears of Obama.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich recently reminded the hosts of Fox & Friends that they had essentially \"invented\" Donald Trump's candidacy by promoting him in friendly weekly interviews for years.\n\nFox & Friends host Steve Doocy pointed out to Gingrich on Monday that the Republican Party establishment was \"uncomfortable with Trump . . This is their nightmare scenario,\" Doocy observed.\n\n\"The billionaire is spending the least amount of money and running away with this thing,\" co-host Brian Kilmeade noted.\n\n\"That's because of you guys,\" Gingrich interrupted. \"Donald Trump gets up in the morning, tweets to the entire planet at no cost, picks up the phone, calls you, has a great conversation for about eight minutes -- which would have cost him a ton in commercial money. And meanwhile, his opponents are all out there trying to raise the money to run an ad.\"\n\nMany voters perceive the Trump brand as truly independent of the political system, the same \"evil system\" the right-wing GOP has taught voters to despise and feel paranoid about. As sitting senators, Cruz and Rubio are by definition entrenched in that very system. Add to the mix that Trump has an uncanny ability to articulate many of the darker sentiments that apparently a lot of people - particularly working-class white men -- harbor. But until \"Mr Strongman\" came along, many of them felt they had to keep those feelings -- in the closet. No longer. Since the media icon with the successful brand and his billions says it is all right to think and blurt out these \"politically incorrect,\" nasty things.\n\nTrump is also the first truly social-media-created candidate. He is not just a passive media creation. Rather with his use of Twitter, and the media's cooperation, of course, he is able to control the narrative each and every day, because what he says is often so provocative, that it attracts attention, eyeballs and TV watchers and becomes part of the discussion. More than ever for virtually all of media, the game is about getting those eyeballs and traffic which is usually the lowest common denominator, right where Trump tends to be.\n\nTrauma America\n\nBut perhaps more importantly than fretting about Trump, the elite panicked thinkers and even progressive analysts might contemplate this: we live in a traumatized country where tens of millions of people live in a state of economic and emotional fear, where the future looks very bleak, and white men are committing suicide with guns, drugs and alcohol at shocking levels, where politics have become completely polarized and the fear of terrorist attacks is almost part of the water supply. Social media has turned some communication into bloodsport and bullying, and the news cycle is a constant 24/7 \"if it bleeds it leads, i.e. in which city did which cop kill which black teenager today?\" No wonder people are traumatized.\n\nWriters and analysts have come up with many explanations for the Trump voter - racism, scapegoating, demagoguery, the media, celebrity and the outsized influence of money on the political system. Sure, these are all as interrelated factors and certainly the media is the delivery system for fear messages. But they are all symptoms of the deeper power of fear and insecurity that our leaders and especially the right-wing have peddled since 9-11 and before. Terrible things are right around the corner unless we change our tune, become more belligerent, keep immigrants out with a wall, turn Muslims into pariahs and force them out, all not-very-coded appeals to insecure white voters. We've seen this movie before. Similar fearmongering hastened the social decline that led to fascism, Nazism, and totalitarianism.\n\nAs I wrote last March, \"People cannot think clearly when they are afraid. As numerous studies have shown, fear is the enemy of reason. It distorts emotions and perceptions, and often leads to poor decisions. For people who have suffered trauma, fear messages can sometimes trigger uncontrollable flight-or-fight responses with dangerous ramifications.\n\n\"Many interlocking aspects of our society have become increasingly sophisticated at communicating messages and information that produce fear responses. Advertising, political ads, news coverage and social media all send the constant message that people should be afraid -- very afraid.\"\n\nThere is the stark economic reality which exacerbate the fears. Nearly half (43.9 percent) of U.S. households live on the edge of financial collapse with almost no savings to fall back on in the event of a job loss, health crisis or other income-eliminating emergency, according to a report by the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED).\n\nThings are as bad or worse for those in retirement or on the brink. In December 2014, 42.9 million people received Social Security retirement benefits that averaged $1,328.58 a month, or roughly $15,943 annually before taxes. One third, or 14.3 million people, derive almost all of their income this way.\n\nOn top of the rampant economic and emotionally insecurity we collectively have endured 15 years of irresponsible post 9-11 fear mongering about terrorism , that has fundamentally changed the nature of American culture. We are a profoundly different country due to the disastrous reactions of Bush/Cheney/ Rice to a small group of highly lethal, but clearly overlooked by the Bush White House, suicide bombers .\n\nThis fear quotient is ever present and powerful as Noam Chomsky underscores in response to a question about how he explains Trump's success in an interview recently posted on Alternet.\n\nIt is ... \"Fear, along with the breakdown of society during the neoliberal period. People feel isolated, helpless, victim of powerful forces that they do not understand and cannot influence. It's interesting to compare the situation in the '30s, which I'm old enough to remember. Objectively, poverty and suffering were far greater. But even among poor working people and the unemployed, there was a sense of hope that is lacking now, in large part because of the growth of a militant labor movement and also the existence of political organizations outside the mainstream.\n\nHistory suggests that when people are in fear, they turn to bullies for protection - fascists like Mussolini and Hitler and the Spanish version -- caudillos like Franco and Chavez - \"strongmen who were often charismatic and whose hold on power depended on control over armed followers, patronage, and vigilance.\"\n\nThe Trump Appeal\n\nInterestingly Americans have never had a prototypical \"strong man\" - someone who doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks, and will \"tell it like it is\" -run for president in our life time. And the guys who threaten to come to the rescue -- like Michael Bloomberg and Ross Perot -- are soft spoken, very wealthy, technocrats. The Trump \"strong man\" tells everyone who will listen that he will make America great again. We will put up walls, we will throw out Muslims, we will have a purer America that we can feel proud of...For desperate people, for angry people, for fearful people, for the millions of alcoholics, addicts and abused people in America, that is a powerful message. They have no hope. This successful guy, loved and often ass-kissed by American media, is giving them hope. What is the alternative?\n\nWe have known forever, that many people do not vote on the issues, but rather personalities. We have known that larger numbers of voters are what some call low-information voters, meaning they are neither informed nor interested in facts or policy alternatives but respond to mega messages. Voters like these make up the large percentage of people who, for example, think Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim. They vote emotionally, out of fear, or to follow God. They have been conditioned to hate, resent, blame and feel victimized by the great liberal conspiracy that gave us Obama.\n\nPerfecting the Art of Hate Speech\n\nIn his speeches Trump often mines the fevered recesses of the right-wing psyche -- and his crowds love him for it.\n\nThe Hill reports that at a primary election-eve rally in Charleston, South Carolina, Trump told a supposed story about how Gen. John Pershing dealt with Muslim terrorists in the U.S.-occupied Philippines of the early 20th century.\n\n\"He took 50 bullets and he dipped them in pig's blood. And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people,\" Trump said, as his crowd cheered. \"And the 50th person, he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years there wasn't a problem.\"\n\n\"The Southern Poverty Law Center points to the presidential election cycle as one of the primary reasons for the rising number of hate groups across the U.S., saying last year was marked by a level of hate speech in mainstream politics not seen in decades. It notes, quote, \"Donald Trump's demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as Jared Taylor and former Klansman David Duke. White supremacist forums are awash with electoral joy, having dubbed Trump their 'Glorious Leader.'\" The Investigation Discovery network will premiere a series titled Hate in America, based on the work of the Southern Poverty Law Center, this Monday, February 29th.\"\n\nTrump has built his brand for several decades and it has always been the same ingredients: frame the story and get the media to focus attention on him; go on the attack, threaten law suits. Keep it simple: me versus them. His basic message: I am the only one who really knows how to get things done In the beginning years The Apprentice averaged more than 20 million viewers a show. A lot of people learned to see Donald Trump as the boss - a man of action.\n\nFrom a Longtime Trump Observer\n\nI have been an often appalled Trump observer since the 1970s, as his role in New York City politics and public life foreshadowed his role on the national and international scene. One myth making Trumpcapade sticks out in my memory.....\n\n\"Once upon a time there was an ice skating rink in Central Park that could no longer make ice. No one could figure out how to fix the skating rink. Years went by and millions of dollars were spent and still no ice. One day a white knight wearing a bright red tie showed up and said: ' Let there be ice!' Four months later there was ice. When asked by the press why the people had been unable to fix the rink themselves the knight said 'they're very nice people and I like them very much but they're all idiots!' And everyone lived happily ever after.\"\n\nAs Forbes explained, this is \"Pretty much the true story of the Wollman Skating Rink fiasco. You can even check theNew York Times. On May 31, 1986 Donald Trump said in an interview with the Times, \"I don't want my name attached to losers. So far the Wollman Rink has been one of the great losers. I'll make it a winner.\" And he did. And it has been successful ever since... and the Trump logo is still attached to the rink web site.\n\nSo there we have it. Donald Trump - a powerful brand, a magnet for authoritarian desires, a unique figure in the American culture, a prime product of a media machine that that is about conflict and controversy - not facts or good judgment. Unfortunately the fear about Trump becoming the nominee and even president, is overshadowed by the overall climate of fear in the country that has made Trump the logical person for many people to turn to. Whether it all leads to a shocking development in American politics or just a close call remains to be seen."]}}
