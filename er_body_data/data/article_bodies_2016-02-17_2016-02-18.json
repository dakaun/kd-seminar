{"Samsung": {"2016-02-17": ["Law enforcement officials say current technologies can make their jobs much more difficult.\n\nApple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook's stand against having his company help unlock encrypted data on the San Bernardino shooters' cellphone is part of a larger battle between the federal government and Silicon Valley.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym directed Apple on Tuesday to help the FBI get around the phone's pass code protection and any auto-erase functions the device might employ.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Cook said that such a move would undermine encryption by creating a backdoor that could potentially be used in the future on devices.\n\nHere is a breakdown:\n\nQ: How big a problem is encrypted technology?\n\nA: In general, prosecutors and intelligence officials say current technologies can make it impossible to examine suspects' communications even if police have a court order.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note that some tech companies have boasted to customers that when their technologies are used, nobody can gain access to their messages ever, including the government.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in a report issued in November that it was unable to execute 111 search warrants for smartphones over the last year because they were running on encrypted technology offered through Apple's iOS 8 operating system.\n\nSeveral cellphone models, including Apple's iPhone 6 and Samsung's Galaxy S6, use advanced encryption algorithms that scramble all the data on the device when a pin code is set.\n\nEncrypted cellphones and text-messaging apps have made it harder for investigators and intelligence services to track suspected plots in real time, or trace locations and connections once they acquire a suspect's device, the FBI has said.\n\nApple changed the way it manages phone encryption in September 2014, a move that makes it more difficult for law enforcement to access encrypted data on cellphones, according to Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California's Center for Computer System Security. Previously, forensic investigators could tap into a device's hardware port and gain access to a phone's data \"independent of needing to try pass codes,\" he said.\n\n\"That path into the device is no longer possible,\" Neuman said.\n\nThe change in the encryption method means Apple may not be able to decrypt the data, according to Neuman. The company could, however, bypass the access code system that would cause the data to be erased, and then grant the FBI access to the encrypted data. Federal investigators would then have to decrypt the data themselves, Neuman said.\n\nQ: Is the federal government pressuring Silicon Valley?\n\nA: In the wake of San Bernardino, President Obama addressed the nation in urging high-tech and law enforcement leaders \"to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.\"\n\nAlthough the tech industry says it wants to help, it's reluctant to give away private information and data to government agencies.\n\nQ: What has the government been trying to do?\n\nA: In January, federal officials announced the creation of a task force to help prevent extremist groups from using social media to radicalize and mobilize recruits. The interagency group will be led by the Homeland Security and Justice departments, but will include staff from the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center and other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, the State Department will establish a unit called the Global Engagement Center to work with allies to deter terrorists from carrying out attacks overseas.\n\nQ: Why goes the government want to unlock the phone?\n\nA: Authorities are trying to determine the couple's movements between the time of the attack at the Inland Regional Center the morning of Dec. 2 and their deaths in a wild firefight with police hours later. Last month, the FBI asked for the public's help in filling in an 18-minute gap in the narrative of the couple's whereabouts.\n\nThe FBI is also probing whether the couple received any help in the attacks.\n\nQ: How did this get to court?\n\nA: The device, an iPhone5, was given to Syed Rizwan Farook by the San Bernardino County Health Department and was used in his job as an inspector, according to the motion.\n\nIt is the tech giant's policy to require law enforcement to obtain search warrants or subpoenas before aiding in investigations. But the company sees the order as an \"overreach by the U.S. government,\" according to the statement.\n\nQ: Does this battle go beyond cellphones?\n\nA: Yes, terrorism spreading through social media has also been a major issue.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, has led a push in Congress for legislation that would require social media companies to root out and report suspicious activity. Tech firms and privacy advocates beat back an effort by Feinstein earlier last year.\n\nLOS ANGELES TIMES", "WASHINGTON - Feb. 16, 2016 - The U.S. intelligence chief acknowledged in testimony last week that it plans to include smart household devices to increase its surveillance capabilities. Household devices that are connected to the Internet - known as the \"Internet of Things\" - may offer consumers some added convenience in monitoring their home, and it may allow the government to increase its monitoring of households too.\n\n\"In the future, intelligence services might use the [Internet of Things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\" James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said in testimony to the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nThat said, the intelligence chief says that \"worldwide threats\" from terrorism as well as domestically \"homegrown extremists\" top its lists of greatest national security threats that may warrant such household monitoring.\n\n\"Security experts examining the Internet of Things take as a given that the U.S. and other surveillance services will intercept the signals the newly networked devices emit, much as they do with those from cellphones,\" The Guardian reports. \"Amateurs are already interested in easily compromised hardware; computer programmer John Matherly's search engine Shodan indexes thousands of completely unsecured web-connected devices.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House unveiled a new cybersecurity initiative that included a pledge to ramp up security for non-traditional networked home devices. The Department of Homeland Security will be testing and certifying networked devices within the \"Internet of Things.\"\n\nA study by Harvard's Beckman Center for Internet and Society, released last week, shows that connected household devices offer an unobtrusive way for intelligence agencies to listen or watch a target.\n\nIn February 2015, media reports, for example, revealed that microphones within Samsung \"smart\" TVs were \"always on\" and could allow hackers to intercept audio from inside a household.\n\n\"Law enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target,\" the authors in the Harvard study note.\n\nSource: \"U.S. Intelligence Chief: We Might Use the Internet of Things to Spy on You,\" The Guardian (Feb. 9, 2016)", "When Rihanna's Anti went Platinum two days after its exclusive release via Tidal and Samsung, some RIAA (Recording Industry Assn. of America) critics smelt a rat, questioning if Samsung's giveaway cheapens the RIAA's the million unit milestone designation. Still others questioned how it could even reach 1 million in domestic U.S. sales, given that Samsung's deal was reported as being limited to 1 million units, and that the giveaway wasn't limited to the U.S. Samsung customers.\n\nRihanna's award was announced simultaneously with the announcement that the RIAA, in recognition of the times, will count streaming toward its certification sales milestones. Consequently, 1,500 streams will count as an album unit. This move comes on the heels of its 20013 alteration to its Gold Single award where it announced that 150 streams would count as a single download.\n\nBillboard spoke with RIAA chairman and CEO Cary Sherman, RIAA director of communications/director of the certification program Liz Kennedy and executive vp of communications Jonathan Lamy about the change.\n\nDoes the RIAA certification program only count U.S. sales?\n\nSherman: Yes.\n\nSince its inception, how many sales awards has the RIAA issued?\n\nSherman: Currently, there are 8,887 Gold albums [sales of 500,000 units], 4,262 Platinum albums [sales of 1 million units]], 1,348 multi-Platinum albums [sales of 2 million or more] and 112 Diamond albums [sales of more than 10 million].\n\nAre those numbers inclusive of each higher sales award threshold?\n\nSherman: Yes.\n\n[Another way to look at the numbers then would be to say: 4,625 albums have only reached Gold; 2,914 have gone past Gold and reached Platinum; 1,236 have gone past Platinum and reached multi-Platinum and 112 have reached Diamond.]\n\nIs this the first time you have changed the formula for a Gold and Platinum albums?\n\nKennedy: There was a time in 1958 where the requirement was proof of 500,000 units sold or the money equivalent back then -- $1 million in sales.\n\nWere labels giving out awards on their own before the RIAA initiated its program in 1958. I know of one instance where a family member has a Gold album from their artist parent hanging on the wall from an album back in the '50's that is not in the RIAA database.\n\nKennedy: I don't know if anybody was doing something like that before the RIAA, but the RIAA is the one that has maintained the standards. That's why we introduced the holograph in the early 1990's, in order to differentiate the RIAA awards from the counterfeit plaques.\n\nWhy change the formula now?\n\nSherman: For a while we've recognized that we would need to put streaming in the mix as consumption changed -- but we needed to do it carefully. So we started with the easiest one to change, the singles awards. We watched that and made sure it worked out, and then after about a year, we started on the albums. While looking at how to implement for the album, we went through an elaborate process, getting feedback form the industry, and going through the same data analysis that we did for the single.\n\nWhat impact will streaming inclusion have on the number of albums that reach the certification status each year?\n\nSherman: 10 years ago, nearly 90 percent of those albums sold enough in that year to reach Gold status. 10 years later, about 30 percent were eligible. With the new rules, we figure about 40 percent of the top 2000 best-sellers for the year will be eligible. We were very cautious in our approach to changing how we calculate what is eligible because the integrity of the process is our foremost consideration. It's difficult to get certified sales awards, and it's a big deal and we didn't want there to be a huge change in how many would be eligible.\n\nYet you caught some heat on the Rihanna certification of Platinum for Anti, which got the award based on the Samsung giveaway?\n\nKennedy: No more than we did when we certified Jay Z. There are two requirements for the certification program. That there is consumer demand and that the artist and label get paid a certain minimum amount. We satisfied both of them with Rihanna. We got the data from the service, we saw the redemption of the download codes. They couldn't just send the album to consumers, the consumer had to initiate the acquisition. The redemption is the indication of the demand.\n\nBut what about the report that Samsung was only going to give away a million copies, which included international customers as well. So how could it have reached a million in the U.S.?\n\nSherman: We saw more than a million confirmed downloads to U.S. customers. We would not count international customers.\n\nSo in Fifth Harmony, we now have their Reflection album with 155,000 units in sales that is now considered Gold. Won't the bands that obtained Gold status purely from sales feel like Roger Maris' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Maris family must feel when they see their father's home run record broken time and again by modern ballplayers, who are benefitting from lower pitcher mounds, a livelier ball, modified bats, smaller distances to the outfield fences, and performance enhancing drugs?\n\nSherman: We haven't needed an asterisk yet.\n\nLamy: Even the most successful album of all time, Michael Jackson's Thriller, only went up two levels [2 million] under our new rules. You are not seeing people jump five levels. When we looked at the criteria we changed it so that the artists from 20 years ago won't feel like this is now less of an accomplishment.\n\nWhen you announce the certifications, will fans be able to see the breakout of the numbers -- how many were sales, streams, TEA?\n\nSherman: There will be no breakout. When we changed for the single, we never specified what the breakout for sales to streams were.\n\nWill streams and track sales of songs released ahead of an album count toward the certification of that album?\n\nSherman: These are lifetime awards, so before and after an album's release all count.\n\nIts my understanding that if there are multiple single versions of a song from the album, only the version of the actual track will count toward the certification? Is that correct? Why that ruling?\n\nKennedy: There has to be a version on the album that will count. That is a small difference from the single, where all versions, as long as they are not longer than the album version by 90 seconds or less, can count toward the certification.\n\nWhy 1,500 streams. Is that because the industry's standard blended stream rate is about $0.005 cents and that 1,500 streams equals the average album wholesale price of $7.50?\n\nSherman: We do not take into account the value of the stream. We see the number of streams as a measure of consumer demand, not the value. As it is, we think streams are under-monetized, and we are complaining loudly about that. If the value of a stream changes, we won't alter the count because we don't want to alter the history of the program because that would impact these milestone achievements.", "The annual 100 million unit or Rs 80,000 crore smartphone market in India is a crowded place with a battery of brands jostling for top spot, or any spot at all. Two challenger brands, Vivo and Intex, have upped the noise in recent months. Having chosen cricket to further their brands in the country that treats the game as a near religious experience, these brands are pouring in the moolah to back their ambitions.\n\nChinese handsets major Vivo, which has the title sponsorship of the Indian Premier League for the next two seasons at Rs 125 crore, has allocated Rs 200 crore for promotion during 2016. Its Indian peer, Intex, responded by bagging the new Rajkot team in the IPL; the venture is estimated to dig a Rs 100-crore-wide hole in the company's coffers over the next two years.\n\nThe industry with 150-odd handset players is set for an intense battle of brands, especially as new brands are knocking down its doors almost every other day. Already the impact is being felt by some of the fast trackers in the space: Both Micromax and Intex have lost market share over the past year. The latest data from International Data Corporation (IDC) for the quarter ended December 2015 shows that the country's largest home-grown smartphone brand Micromax lost nearly four per cent market share during 2015. While, it still holds the second spot in the pecking order, after Samsung, its share plunged to 14.1 per cent in October-December 2015 from 18 for the same period a year ago. Intex, meanwhile, lost its position to China's Lenovo to end up fourth.\n\nKeen to regain lost ground, Intex has tagged on to cricket for building its brand, just as its Chinese rival Vivo has. And interestingly so has Micromax, it has bagged the title sponsorship of T-20 Asia Cup which is going to take place weeks before the world cup. But will it work?\n\nAccording to industry veterans, cricket rarely lets a brand down. And tournaments like the IPL are successful, tried and tested ways to get the attention of a large number of consumers at one go. \"Cricket tournaments help brands gain a permanent place in consumer mind space in India\", Shashin Devsare, executive director, Karbonn Mobiles said.\n\nFor Vivo, which is new to the Indian market, the idea is to get maximum eyeballs in the shortest possible time and high decibel events like the IPL offer the perfect pitch. The move will help Vivo become a household name, industry analysts say. For Intex, cricket is a means to improving its brand value. The company has been under pressure from Lenovo since mid-2015, which eventually toppled it to gain the number three spot in smartphones market in the December quarter.\n\nBoth brands could however gain by taking a hard look at the story of Micromax. Micromax raced ahead way too fast, skipping past companies such as Lenovo, Intex, Lava and Karbonn although they were always closely behind. All of them have well-established offline distribution channels and are working on to strengthen local manufacturing - like Micromax. The majority have gained during the past one year but, Micromax, which once featured among the top ten vendors globally, has lost out. Internal scuffles over leadership have cost the company dear as has misreading market trends.\n\nGiven the relentless pressure from competitors, the handsets industry is a slippery slope. And for Vivo and Intex, even as they focus on gaining the popular vote through cricket, the lesson to learn would be to not ignore the ways in which other brands such as Lava and Karbonn are getting into customers' hearts.\n\nKarbonn Mobiles is banking on the need for vernacular language based smartphones. With nearly 70 per cent of the population in rural areas, the strategy will yield rich dividends, Devsare says. The fifth largest player Lava, which has managed to hold on to its market share at seven per cent during the year, is focusing on physical aesthetics, according to Navin Chawla, vice president and product head, Lava International.\n\nLava and Karbonn have allocated Rs 200 and Rs 150 crore, respectively, for advertisement and promotion expenses during 2016 but, cricket is not their game. \"Since, our brand is already known and has recall among consumers, sponsoring such events is not for us anymore\", Devsare said. Both have sponsored international cricket tournaments, played in India, earlier.\n\nLenovo, which gained significant market share during the past one year - from less than seven per cent in December, 2014 to 11.6 per cent a year later has positioned itself as a quality brand, but at a reasonable price. According to Faisal Kawoosa, lead analyst, CyberMedia Research, it has benefited from superior positioning and its value for money proposition. For all those stepping on to the cricket pitch to build their brands, the best advice may be to bear in mind the famed unpredictability of the game they are betting on.", "The Supreme Court has allowed Roy Hill project manager Samsung C&T to seize a $7.5 million security bond from construction company Laing O'Rourke.\n\nThe seizure relates to a dispute between the two parties over payments for work on the Pilbara iron ore project's port facilities.\n\nSubcontractor Laing O'Rourke left the project prematurely 12 months ago when the dispute arose.

It wouldn't even be especially difficult,\" said Zulfikar Ramzan, chief technology officer for RSA, one of the nation's oldest computer security companies.\n\n\"It's trivial for them to write this code, it's an afternoon's worth of work. It's just a patch to one phone and then that's it,\" said Philip Lieberman, president and CEO of Lieberman Software, a Los Angeles-based computer security firm.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the Cupertino, Calif. company to help the FBI with software that disables the security feature on the 5C recovered from Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the attackers in the December San Bernardino, Calif. shooting that killed 14 people.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDad: San Bernardino shooter agreed with ISIL, 'obsessed with Israel'\n\nThe FBI has Farook's iPhone, but doesn't have the password, likely four or six digits, necessary to unlock it.\n\nThe agency believes that Farook enabled the phone's auto-erase security measure, which would automatically erase the phone's data after ten failed password attempts.\n\nTo get around that, the FBI asked Apple to give it a way to circumvent the auto-erase security so the agency can try millions of password combinations on Farook's phone until it gets in, a so-called brute force attack.\n\nThat would require Apple to write a new version of the phone's operating system to be installed on Farook's phone that would circumvent the security features, Apple CEO Cook said in an open letter to its customers Wednesday.\n\nThe FBI can't do it themselves because to put new software on an Apple device, it must be digitally signed with a special key that only Apple knows. Without that digital key, the phone would reject the software.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nApple's CEO Tim Cook says firm will oppose iPhone court order\n\nCook said creating a new version of the software, what he called a \"backdoor to the iPhone\" would be \"too dangerous to create.\"\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,\" Cook wrote in a letter published to Apple's website.\n\nThe White House said Wednesday it was not asking Apple to \"create a new backdoor\". The FBI has said it's seeking assistance only to unlock Farook's phones, not all iPhones.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest disputed Apple's assertion that Justice Department is asking the tech giant to create a 'back door' into its product for the investigation into the San Bernardino mass shooting.

The DoD is aiming to upgrade 4 million machines to Microsoft's new operating system within the next year. The decision was made, in part, due to Windows 10 offering better security features to prevent data breaches and withstand hacking attacks.\n\nThis is a big win for for Microsoft's enterprise division. While nearly 200 million devices are running Windows 10, the company reported only 22 million of these Windows 10 devices are in the enterprise and education environments, meaning the DoD deal alone will add nearly 20% to that. Business tends to be more skittish about migrating to unproven software updates, the government even more so, making the accelerated transition schedule eyebrow-raising.\n\nDoes it matter?\n\nThe announcement was significant on three levels. First is the direct revenue and profit, which will be significant for Microsoft. Second, and nearly as important, Uncle Sam essentially stamped a seal of approval on Windows 10, which could contribute to a surge of enterprise upgraders in the private sector. Third, the DoD also bestowed security certification upon the newest Surface products, meaning they are on its approved list of products its agencies can purchase for employee use. This points toward a longer-range strategy for Microsoft to leverage its software in order to grow device sales in its enterprise business.\n\nComputer security has been a greater focus for the U.S. government since it experienced a series of data breaches, most notably the Office of Personnel Management hack that exposed the sensitive data of at least 22.1 million people. On a device level, BlackBerry and Samsung have worked toward developing enterprise-focused mobile-security solutions with the former's Good Secure EMM Suites and the latter's Knox security suite. The DoD's seal of approval on Microsoft will be to the detriment of these competitors.\n\nFor Microsoft, this is good news for both the enterprise business and the prospects for the Surface line, but whether the private sector will follow the Pentagon's lead remains to be seen. Until we know more, it's not necessarily a thesis-altering event. I'd continue to follow Windows 10's adoption in the private-sector enterprise markets closely.", "The analog power house faces a paradox: Trim down to appeal to investors, but continue to invest in industry-leading products.\n\nMaxim Integrated will continue to focus on power management IC markets where the company already has considerable strengths, said Tun\u00e7 Doluca, the company's president and CEO, at an investor's meeting (February 10). These power-intensive markets include automotive and industrial electronics, data center power management, mobile electronics and wearables.\n\nBut penetrating these markets may be hampered by cutbacks in R&D spending, and the disarming of potentially useful analog fabrication facilities. With the IC industry currently in the process of consolidation, both size and incumbency are enablers for continued growth. The company must polish its balance sheet if wants to attract investors.\n\nMaxim is targeting the right markets, insisted Doluca. Maxim's revenues in automotive electronics, data centers, and industrial power grew 18% per year from 2012 to 2015. Maxim's revenue in the automotive power sector grew 43% per year in the same period. Continued growth in these markets is most almost a certainty, the company suggested.\n\nWhat Maxim brings to the party is enviable strength in power management ICs: voltage regulators, AC-to-DC converters, DC-to-DC converters among standard analog building blocks; multi-function PMICs among the custom analog components. Maxim is currently the third largest analog IC supplier, behind Texas Instruments and Analog Devices, and number two in the standard power management market behind Texas Instruments. To continue to succeed in growing its revenues, the Company will need to identify specific analog circuits demanded in each market, engineer them with competitive feature sets, and manufacture them efficiently.\n\n$100 per car\n\nAutomotive electronics, for example, is now 17% of company's revenue. Looking forward, Maxim sees a 9% CAGR from 2015 to 2018; a revenue opportunity of up to $100 per car. The specific part types in demand include battery management devices (for the multi-cell lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles), serial links (for data-laden automotive buses), external LED lighting drivers (for head lamps and tail lamps) and power distribution circuits. Serial link supports ADAS cameras and hi-res displays. Smart keys are an additional market opportunity for Maxim.\n\nIndustrial electronics, requiring high-voltage controllers, now account for $600 million of Maxim's revenue. The projected market growth is 7% CAGR -- from $8.4 billion in 2015 to $10.4 billion in 2018 -- with factory automation serving as the largest industrial market segment, and its fastest growing. Maxim makes parts for Programmable Logic controllers (PLCs), including pulse width modulators for motor drive, precision op amps, and the ever popular RS232 interface transceivers. Servicing the industrial market also requires the company to make its high-end products more accessible to smaller industrial customers. And this signifies a greater role for Maxim's distributors, primarily Avnet.\n\nIn data center power management, the enterprise computing segment did not grow as rapidly as hoped for in 2015. But Maxim is satisfied with the positon it has in data center power management. The server power management ICs (multi-phase power controllers), acquired with Volterra, supports 20% greater power densities. The efficiency improvements provide aggregate savings in millions of dollars.\n\nMaxim sees mobility and wearables as a $12 billion opportunity. The CAGR for wearables -- consumers of power managers, audio decoders and amplifiers -- is 30%; reaching 380 million units in 2018. These include part for smart watches, health monitoring, and fitness devices.\n\nUnder mobility, Maxim showcased its expertise in mobile power management ICs, including the highly-integrated PMIC devices that control mobile handsets. It turns out the small size and low power consumption of PMICs are welcome in automotive consoles. A Maxim PMIC currently supports NVidia's processor and display controller for automotive consoles. The PMIC integrates as many as 14 separate power management functions. Automotive console makers appreciate the small package size enabled by integration, but also the low power consumption -- 2\u00b5A at standby -- as this supports an \"always on\" capability for automotive systems.\n\nWhile Tun\u00e7 Doluca did not mention the company's name (referring to \"our largest customer\"), Maxim's business with Samsung exceeded 20% for several years. The company's business with Samsung is currently 17% -- down from a one-quarter high of 28%. The priority is to \"diversify,\" Maxim said, meaning it will attempt to reduce its dependency on a small number of very large customers.\n\nMaxim's on-going challenge would be to develop industry leading products without spiking R&D spending. Tun\u00e7 Doluca more than once referenced the talent engineers on his staff, but their challenge now becomes to streamline the design process. The company will also elevate the role of catalog products -- called the \"core technology\" -- suggesting perhaps that legacy products can be revamped to serve new markets. With lower R&D expenses and a long market life, core technology product (representing $800 million in Maxim's revenues) may play a role in margin control. Gross margin target is 70%.\n\nGoing fab lite\n\nAs part of its cost-efficiency program, Maxim will sell off under-utilized fabrication facilities. The sale of its San Jose facility to Apple was completed last fall. While Doluca refused to speculate on what Apple might do with the facility, he did remark that the 75,000-square foot property did not include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment (just a clean room shell). Maxim is also selling a San Antonio-based manufacturing facility, and re-tooling a Dallas bump factory.\n\nManufacturing efficiencies -- up to a 30% cost saving -- can be obtained, the company insists, by producing semiconductors on 300mm (12-inch) wafers. Texas Instruments was the first analog IC maker to use 300mm wafers in its Richardson, Texas fabrication facility (RFAB). Maxim was the second analog supplier to use 300mm wafers, as early as 2010, with the help of a foundry partner, PowerChip in Taiwan. The products coming out of that facility were primarily power management devices, using a Maxim-propriety BCD process, which implants DMOS power transistors on CMOS substrates.\n\nNow Maxim is hoping to make the 300mm wafer usage standard across the company. Much of the 300mm equipment available for analog IC makers is used equipment, broken in by memory makers. But the use of depreciated equipment, Maxim's financial officers maintain, serves as a \"tailwind\" for gross margin accounting.\n\nAlso on the manufacturing front, Maxim told its investors it will utilize a 90nm CMOS geometry for its preferred platform. Its denser logic would support new-generation PMICs. The proprietary process -- developed in conjunction with an unnamed foundry partner -- takes advantage of many years of \"deep submicron R&D,\" says Doluca. This would be something of a first, since -- unlike digital CMOS, whose performance increases with shrinking geometries -- analog does not scale. Consequently, custom PMIC makers continue their work in 0.18- and 0.13-micron CMOS. The 90nm process would more appropriately be considered a 2017 platform, Maxim acknowledged, as a very small proportion of the company's production use the process now.", "This is The Divergence, a weekly column from The Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, exploring the spaces around modern technology.\n\nTomorrow, the FCC will vote on what is formally known as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Commercial Availability of Navigation Devices, or what the teens are (not) calling #unlockthebox. The goal is to require companies like Comcast and Time Warner Cable to allow anyone to connect to cable TV networks with their own devices -- which would mean that Apple, Microsoft, and Roku could finally build complete TV products without having to negotiate for programming deals. As you might expect, the cable industry is fighting this idea tooth and nail -- they've set up an entire new industry lobbying group called the Future of TV Coalition that's running some super scary ads about the FCC, um, killing diversity or something.\n\nBut really, make no bones about it: unlocking the box is a terrific idea. You should definitely be able to go out and buy a fancy new Samsung or LG smart TV and be able to use it without a nasty cable company set-top box in the way. And things like the Xbox One and Apple TV should definitely be able to integrate with the cable television you're already paying for, allowing you to see streaming services and games and live TV all in one interface. I mean, that is the dream.\n\n\"The age of the closed, proprietary set-top box is behind us.\" -- Comcast CEO Brian Roberts in 2008\n\nHow might one describe this dream? If you're a wild-eyed optimist, you might say that \"whether you're at the PC, or at the TV using your home network, or even an Xbox, or even a portable device, the consumer gets one single, integrated user interface.\"\n\nYou might even go farther: you might say that \"the age of the closed, proprietary set-top box is behind us,\" or that the \"era of open cable is here.\"\n\nYeah. Here's the thing about those quotes: they're not from Apple, or Microsoft, or Roku. They are direct from Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, who gave a speech at CES 2008 announcing a platform called tru2way that was designed to -- surprise! -- let any company build a device that could access and record cable television. He even brought Panasonic's then-CEO Toshihiro Sakamoto on stage to unveil a portable LCD TV with a built-in DVR that could record shows from Comcast's cable and then play them on the go. The thing looks completely insane now -- it's all here in this CNET video:\n\nRoberts was also effusive about tru2way to Reuters at the time: \"We also knew there would be more competition and we had to change,\" he said. And the massive NCTA cable lobbying group published a gushing blog post about tru2way, comparing it to the internet revolution that allowed an entirely new economy to be built on top of unrestricted broadband internet.\n\n\"The original premise then, as now, is 'choice sells,'\" they said.\n\nWell then. That's an awful lot of love for the idea that anyone should be able to connect a device to the cable network. So why the complete walkback eight years later?\n\nIn a word: apps.\n\nThe concept of apps simply didn't exist in 2008, and definitely not the explosion of video apps that are now the mainstay of every phone, tablet, and streaming box like the Apple TV. \"The future of TV is apps,\" is literally Apple's marketing slogan for the Apple TV. And the TV industry is betting big on apps instead of boxes. Cable companies like Comcast say they would actually love to get rid of the aging set-top boxes gathering dust in customers' homes and instead deliver cable TV service to apps running on every screen in your home. It's an interesting vision of the future, and parts of it are already here: there's a Time Warner Cable app for the Roku, for instance, and Comcast has Xfinity apps for a variety of platforms. (But not the Apple TV yet. Someone please send me a screenshot!)\n\nThe cable industry is betting big on apps, not boxes\n\nAnd, of course, if the cable companies keep their sky-high rates as they are while reducing the costs of delivering and servicing hardware, well, they just created a bunch of pure profit.\n\nBut all of that assumes that the cableco apps will be any good. And it assumes that the current deeply fragmented consumer TV hardware market is even ready to support an app revolution, which it most definitely is not. Here's a non-exhaustive list of the current major players who sell TVs and streaming boxes and the platforms they run:\n\nYeah, that's totally sustainable. Small cable companies are definitely going to be able to write, support, and maintain apps for all of these platforms, no problem. And all of these apps are going to integrate natively into all these platforms and allow them to compete as first-class citizens, leading to a burst of innovation in the living room as computing and television finally meet.\n\nYeah, that's never going to happen.\n\nInstead, cable companies are going to pick one or two favored platforms -- say, Samsung and Apple -- and everyone else will get stuck with a cable box. And that's not so bad, because the cable box business is pretty good.\n\n\"It's no surprise that cable monopolies, which thrive on overcharging consumers for renting boxes, haven't followed though on their commitment to an open set-top box world,\" says Gene Kimmelman from Public Knowledge. \"Why should we now believe they are motivated to move away from the price-gouging model? It will take real competition to ensure consumers get a better deal.\"\n\n\"This is not a technology problem. It is a business problem.\"\n\nAnd deeper inside the industry, people think it's actually time to break this whole thing open.\n\n\"There has been a mafia-style carve up of the nation, market by market, where cable companies don't compete with each other,\" one very senior executive in the TV industry told me. \"This is not a technology problem. It is a business problem compounded by the duopoly that exists in every TV market. (Would you like cable or satellite?) And without a bomb being dropped, the situation will likely stay on its current path.\"\n\nThe cable companies say that it's unfair to let companies like Samsung and Apple and Google build devices that sit in front of their TV services -- the cable companies endure the tense, endless negotiations and pay millions for content, after all -- but it's possible they're cutting off their nose to spite their face.\n\nThis dream is coming true one way or another\n\n\"If [they] stepped back and looked at the marketplace they would realize that this could be a great way for them to retain pay TV subscribers,\" said this executive. \"Many people want to quit because of the bad interface, the cost of STB rentals, the limited access across device types, and the total lack of innovation in the experience.\"\n\nWhat would you rather have: an Apple TV with a Comcast app, or an Apple TV with an Apple-designed program guide and DVR interface in front of Comcast's services? The TV industry made the promise of open cable in 2008, and now it's time to see which dream actually comes true.", "If you pre-ordered your 4K Blu-ray disks at Amazon you might want to look away now: electronics retailer Best Buy has started selling disks two weeks before the official date.\n\nRelated Links Ultra HD '4K' Blu-ray: Here's what we know Hands-on with the world's first 4K Blu-ray player 'The Martian' amongst first 4K Blu-rays coming in March\n\nCNET spotted titles including \"Chappie\", \"Fantastic Four\" and Academy Award hopeful \"The Martian\" at the 14th St Manhattan outlet of Best Buy today.

There are rumours suggesting that it will look similar to the S6, but come with a MicroSD slot, pack a longer-lasting battery, and run on a much faster processor.\n\nTwo versions of the smartphone are expected to be released: a 5.1-inch flat-screen version 'S7', and a 5.5-inch curved-screen 'S7 Edge'.\n\nConsumers will have to wait until the official launch event to find out the real specifications of the phone and its appearance.\n\nShare this article:TwitterFacebookLinkedInPrint", "Within the last couple of weeks, you told us what you thought about LG and HTC at the moment, how they could win you over, and if their next phones are even on your radar. Today, we move onto Motorola and ask that you share with us your thoughts on whether or not 2016 could be an exciting year for the Lenovo-owned smartphone maker.\n\nIn recent months, the future of Motorola hasn't necessarily been called into question, but I think it's quite obvious that some major changes are on the horizon after an up and down year. We've seen reports about Motorola completely dying as brand, yet they aren't in reality. We have seen reports suggest that Lenovo will do ridiculous things like kill off the Moto G line, yet they aren't doing anything close to that. We have seen Lenovo talking about the next in the Moto line, a phone that will be \"More innovative, more attractive.\" We have seen them cut off phones after just a year and turn into one of the worst at updating their phone line after being one of the best. We have seen them create one of the best smartphones of the past year (here are reasons to buy one), along with the best Android Wear watch.\n\nSee? It's been a year of good, bad, and confusing for Motorola.\n\nFor 2016, I have to admit that I'm sort of envisioning much of the same. I wouldn't be shocked if we got a 3rd gen version of the Moto 360 and a new Moto line, including an X and G. But I'm wondering if any of it can match what Samsung, LG, and HTC are about to throw at us? Not that Motorola has been boring in recent years, it's just that everyone else seems to be really kicking things up a notch.\n\nIs Motorola, now that Lenovo is in complete control, ready to do the same? Will this be an exciting year for Motorola or one where we drop an, \"Ugh, Lenovo?\"", "Mobile World Congress is approaching, and chip companies have already started making small announcements ahead of the show. Today, Samsung took the wraps off of the eight-core Exynos Octa 7870, a new SoC intended for midrange smartphones.\n\nThe chip itself looks solid but unexciting -- it has eight 1.6GHz ARM Cortex A53 CPU cores, a 300Mbps Category 6 LTE modem, and an undisclosed GPU that supports up to 1920\u00d71200 screens. More interesting is the fact that the chip will be made with Samsung's 14nm FinFET manufacturing process, which made the Exynos 7420 shine in Samsung's Galaxy flagships last year. Better manufacturing processes reduce the amount of heat produced and the amount of power used by these processors, which gives chipmakers the room to make the chips run faster, consume less power, or do a little of both.\n\nThe 14nm process is showing up in more and more places, which suggests that it's growing more mature -- it will make an appearance in the new Exynos 8 Octa 8890 that's likely to ship in the Galaxy S7 and its variants. Qualcomm is using the same process for its upcoming Snapdragon 820 and 625 SoCs and the Snapdragon X16 modem.\n\nThe Exynos 7 Octa 7870 is in mass production now, which means it should start showing up in consumer devices sooner rather than later.", "GAME Stores at the Grove Mall in Windhoek was this week forced to replace a damaged Samsung Ultra TV after a Walvis Bay customer asked the media to publicise his plight.

Password reuse and weak password strings allow attackers to retrieve passwords even from a hashed format.\n\nBecause of this, in 2013, PayPal and Lenovo started a new open initiative called the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance. With time, other companies joined, such as Alibaba, Bank of America, Google, Intel, ING, MasterCard, Microsoft, Qualcomm, RSA, Samsung, Visa, and many others more.\n\nFIDO Alliance has already done all the heavy lifting\n\nFor the past two years, this group has been quietly working on a new set of APIs that will make it easier to authenticate users with passwordless solutions. Their API was specifically crafted to work across different browsers and has a pluggable architecture.\n\nCurrently, the FIDO 2.0 Web APIs allow developers to authenticate users via biometrics (voice, eye, fingerprint) and encryption-based solutions (portable USB dongles with an encryption key), but other solutions can be plugged in when they arise.\n\nIn November 2015, the FIDO Alliance has donated this API to the W3C, which has now announced it plans to use it as the base of its upcoming Web Authentication API.\n\n\"Our mission is to revolutionize authentication on the Web through the development and global adoption of technical specifications that supplant the world's dependency on passwords with interoperable strong authentication,\" said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance. \"With W3C's acceptance of the FIDO 2.0 submission, and the chartering of this new Web Authentication Working Group, we are well on our way to accomplishing that mission.\"\n\nPrinciples behind the FIDO 2.0 Web APIs", "Samsung revised its privacy policy yet again after an activist pointed out language in an earlier version that advised Smart TV owners to not discuss personal and sensitive information around their devices.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) activist Parker Higgins told The Daily Beast that Samsung's advisory noted that anything recorded by one of its Smart TVs could be captured and transmitted to a third party.\n\nShortly after, Samsung clarified its policy to say its Smart TVs \"don't monitor living room conversations\".\n\nThe company also explained that some interactive voice commands, along with other information about the device, may be transmitted to a third party but only if the user enables the feature, according to a statement.\n\nThe information is shared with Nuance Communications, which converts interactive voice commands to text to improve the user experience, the company said.", "Don't put your cellphone under a pillow when sleeping or when charging your device.Please share this tip and b safe! pic.twitter.com/uwD3PXgVQf -- NYPD 33rd Precinct (@NYPD33Pct)\n\nFebruary 16, 2016\n\nSource: NYPD 33rd Precinct/Twitter\n\nIF YOU ARE in the habit of charging your phone beneath your pillow at night, for pity's sake please stop.\n\nIf that doesn't convince you then the following just might.\n\nThe NYPD have tweeted the aftermath of a phone catching fire while charging underneath a pillow, and it is not one bit pretty.\n\nThe incident reportedly happened in the Washington Heights area of Manhattan according to ABC7 New York, a report that also suggests that the fire happened while the ruined Samsung phone's owner slept.\n\nSource: NYPD33pct/Twitter\n\nThe damage done to the bed is quite dramatic, with holes burnt clear through the bedspread.\n\nSource: NYPD33pct/Twitter\n\nA lesson, if such a lesson be needed, that electricity, batteries, pillows, and sleeping people do not comfortable bedfellows make.\n\nSource: NYPD33pct/Twitter\n\nSource: NYPD33pct/Twitter\n\nRead: A smartphone that costs \u20ac6 is going on sale in India Read: The Pope was not impressed that someone nearly pulled him down", "It is very rare that you will ever see someone with a first generation Apple iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy. Smartphones and tablets normally have a short upgrade cycle and through incentives with mobile carriers, it is fairly easy to get a new device every few years. E-Readers rarely offer any new technical innovations that compel users to upgrade to the latest and greatest. What are the vast majority of e-reader owners looking for when they do consider an upgrade and what would make them drop everything and buy something right away? We have new data that answers these very questions.\n\nIn January we asked 1,381 people what would make them upgrade their e-reader. These people are mostly hardcore users that have owned many digital readers in the past and live in a myriad of countries, such as Canada, US, UK and most of continental Europe.\n\n527 people, which represented 38% of the vote said that they would buy a new e-reader if a major brand released something that was bigger than six inches.\n\nThe vast majority of e-readers currently on the market by companies like Amazon and Barnes and Noble are six inches in size. Smaller devices are cheaper to make and tend to be more pocket friendly. Amazon did experiment with the DX, which was a 9.7 inch e-reader, but they released it at a time when touchscreen devices were not the norm and customers failed to buy it in droves. The only mainstream company to buck the six inch trend was Kobo, with their 6.7 Aura HD and H20 e-reader.\n\n191 people, which represented 14% of the vote said they were looking for a color e-reader. There have been few color readers developed over the years and the ones who have, have been overpriced and had terrible specs. The Pocketbook Color Lux and Ectaco Jetbook color are two of the most notable examples. E-Ink Triton 2 is the panel of choice for color e-readers, but the technology is almost four years old and tremendously outdated. The one glimmer of hope is Amazon, who have been hiring executives at a new Chinese plant to manufacture Liquavista color panels, which are ideal for e-readers.\n\n135 people said that they wanted a waterproof e-reader, 125 said they wanted an e-reader that employed the new IMX.7 dual core processor, 119 want an even higher resolution display, 116 want a major brand to let users install their own Android apps and 104 want audio functionality to listen to audiobooks and music.\n\nWhat surprised me most about this new data report was how enamored people are with large screen displays. Apparently there is a large segment of users that really want a company like Amazon, B&N, or Kobo to give them a larger screen display to read manga, textbooks, maps, PDF documents and e-books.", "Despite the relatively slow uptake of Canonical's Ubuntu mobile, the phone-tailored version of its desktop Linux software, Meizu appears confidently committed to the nascent operating system. After debuting the sleek and beautiful MX4 this past August, the company's back with a handset to showcase the newest version of Ubuntu for phones: the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition.\n\nIf the smartphone's design seems conspicuously familiar (and if the \"Ubuntu Edition\" moniker didn't give it away), that's because it isn't new. Rather, it, much like the MX4 before it, is a rebranded variant of one of Meizu's Android-powered phones -- the Pro 5.\n\nRelated: Ubuntu's second phone adds an HD screen and a 13-megapixel camera\n\nUnlike the decidedly mid-range MX4 before it, though, the Pro 5 features top-end hardware. It's got a 5.7-inch 1080p AMOLED display, Samsung's octa-core Exynos 7420 chip, 3GB or 4GB of RAM (depending on configuration), and 32GB/64GB of storage. Rounding out the Pro 5's internal accouterments is a Sony 21-megapixel and 5-megapixel sensor for the front and rear, respectively, a 3,050mAh battery, and a fingerprint reader.\n\nOn the software side, the latest Ubuntu mobile's been upgraded in a major respect: Scopes, the pared-down search application that supports social media, calendar, message, weather, and call feeds accessible from the Ubuntu home screen, now also supports the \"liking\" and \"favoriting\" of items.\n\nSeparately, new apps have joined the Ubuntu ecosystem: Spotify recently launched a client, as did games platform Play Canvas. The new additions don't quite put Ubuntu mobile's app offering on an equal footing with Android and iOS -- its app store still lacks first-party clients from familiar services like Whatsapp and Google Maps -- but the situation's nonetheless improving.\n\nUnfortunately, the Pro 5 doesn't support what's arguably Ubuntu mobile's headlining feature: the ability to transform any old monitor into a fully-featured Ubuntu desktop with nothing more than a dock and display cable (think Windows 10's Continuity). It's already built into the latest generation of Ubuntu mobile tablets -- BQ's M10 supports it -- but Canonical says that phone support will require newer, as-yet unannounced devices.\n\nRelated: Finally -- Ubuntu's first phone is coming to Europe\n\nIf nothing else, the launch of the Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is a sign that Canonical's Ubuntu mobile initiative is alive and kicking. This year will be the first time that Ubuntu-powered phones will be available for purchase in brick-and-mortar stores, and Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth and CEO Jane Silber say the company's pleased with the progress it's seen.\n\nThe Pro 5 will be available for pre-order during the Mobile World Congress next week, and will ship globally. Pricing has yet to be announced, but given the beefy hardware, you can bet it'll be a good deal higher than, say, the $319 MX4, the $219 BQ E5 HD Ubuntu Edition, or the dirt cheap Aquaris E4.5 UE.", "Samsung may have officially launched the Marshmallow update for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, but the new firmware is still nowhere to be found. It should be arriving any moment now on those devices, though, while a plethora of Galaxies are waiting in the queue, too.\n\nThe new update brings the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system plus quite a few TouchWiz goodies. Today Samsung shed some light on the new TouchWiz features the Galaxy devices will be getting with Marshmallow.\n\nSamsung Internet 4.0 is the new version of the OEM web browser, and while many people are sticking to Chrome, now there might be more good reasons to consider using the built-in app.\n\nInternet 4.0 supports a new feature called Secret Mode - it is protected with your fingerprint and can be easily accessed by using the biometric sensor. It's an enhanced version of the regular Incognito Mode, and while it won't store any history, auto-fill data, or cookies, it allows you to save bookmarks. Those are stored in a separate space, encrypted, and protected by your fingerprint courtesy of KNOX security.\n\nThe Secure Web Auto Login is also available - it was introduced already with Internet 3.0. If enabled, all pages that are set to auto-login will require your fingerprint authentication to login automatically each time.\n\nThe Cross App functionality is also something worth mentioning. With this services Samsung allows you to explore easily content without exiting your current app. For example, if you have a link in a message or an email, you can swipe, and a browser window will pop up displaying the linked web page. Then you just need to swipe again and close the popup.\n\nThe Cross App services work with media and links, but it seems you will be able to use those features only withing TouchWiz default apps such as the Chart client, Messages, Email, Internet, among others.\n\nThe Marshmallow update will also bring better integration of Gear VR, new power saving modes, MIDI protocol, and native app permission control.\n\nThese new features may explain why Samsung is taking its time to release those Marshmallow updates. Hopefully, they will be out soon.", "The Samsung Galaxy A9 (2016) came into our office for a review, but we'll marvel at its 6\" Super AMOLED screen later. For now, let's look at the chipset - it's our first encounter with the Snapdragon 652.\n\nIt's a mid-range chipset, but it's Qualcomm's first (and among the first in general) to feature Cortex-A72, the successor to A57. It has four of them, plus four A53s. Basically, it's like the Snapdragon 810, but the big cores are next generation.\n\nThe GPU is Qualcomm's 5th series, an Adreno 510, which promises a speed increase and power savins compared to the 4xx generation. It also supports the new Vulkan API, which is a low-level, low-overhead interface between 3D games and the hardware.\n\nThat's assuming equal build and it's also the only place where the S652 truly shows it's mid-range character. It was built on a 28nm process (used since at least the Snapdragon 600 in 2013). That's compared to 20nm for Snapdragon 8xx and 14nm for the latest chipsets, including another 6-series entry, the 625.\n\nThe manufacturing process is important for efficiency - more nanometers mean more power is used. This limits the clock speed that can be achieved with no cooling (like on a phone).\n\nCompared to the Kirin 950 used in the Huawei Mate 8, which also uses 4x A72 + 4x A53, the clock speeds are a good 0.5GHz lower. We'll see the impact this has on performance.\n\nWe kick things off with AnTuTu 6, a full-system benchmark. The Galaxy A9 (2016) trounces the A5 (2016) even though they are part of the same lineup. It also comes withing a hair's breadth of the S808-powered LG V10, a recent flagship. The Mate 8, Nexus 6P and Note5 have a significant lead, though.\n\nHigher is better\n\nLet's investigate closer. The single-core performance of the A72 cores should be 20%-60% faster than an A57 clock for clock. That's the key though, the flagship chipsets are clocked high enough to offset this.\n\nHigher is better\n\nStill, when all eight cores are engaged, the Galaxy A9 (2016) pulls ahead of the S810-based Nexus 6P. It comes close to the Galaxy Note5 too.\n\nHigher is better\n\nFinally, the GPU. Adreno 510 is the base for the 5xx series, but even it should be competitive with the 4xx generation. Apparently not as fast as the Adreno 430 (probably due to clock speed reasons again), but it's as fast as the Adreno 418. It even matched the Mali-T880 in the Huawei, but that one is low on cores, just 4 (the Note5 has 8 T760 cores).\n\nHigher is better\n\nWe mentioned heat. You would expect a 28nm chip to get pretty steamy, but the Samsung Galaxy A9 (2016) and its Snapdragon 652 chipset run cool even under load.", "The Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) has been given the OK by the FCC (after it was certified by the Bluetooth SIG). This certification puts the battery capacity at 3,300mAh - a nice 300mAh bump from the original (and it also disproves the 4,300mAh claim).\n\nThe phone has been benchmarked a couple of times, both in Snapdragon and Exynos flavors. The Exynos model will be the new 7870 Octa, based on Cortex-A53 and Mali-T830 and built on 14nm.\n\nThe Snapdragon model is less clear - GFX Bench detected Snapdragon 615 (same as the original model), but kernel patches suggested a newer Snapdragon 650 (with Cortex-A72 cores), a better match for the Exynos.\n\nEven the amount of RAM is unclear - it goes from double (3GB) to a bit more (2GB), compared to the original J7.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty certain that the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) will increase the Super AMOLED resolution to 1080p and you'll get a 13MP/1080p camera. Note that the device the FCC tested, SM-J7109, is a dual-SIM model headed for China.", "Samsung will officially introduce the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge this Sunday in Barcelona, as you may know. And as we get closer to that moment, the Korean company is teasing more and more aspects of its upcoming flagship smartphones.\n\nOne of the things that has been rumored to return to this generation of the top of the line Galaxy S devices after an absence in last year's S6 and S6 edge is water resistance. This did feature in the Galaxy S5 from 2014, and along with microSD card support will be making a comeback with the S7 line.\n\nThat fact has pretty much been confirmed by the teaser video you can see above, which originates at Samsung's official Twitter account. There's no point in focusing on the fact that people sometimes drop their phones in water, unless the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge can withstand such an encounter. Now all that's left is for us to find out the exact IP code for the new models, which will tell us how long they can be safely submerged. But we assume that's a tidbit that will only be officially revealed on February 21.", "The collaboration between Meizu and Canonical (the company behind the Ubuntu operating system) is still going strong, it seems. Following the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition from last year, today the two have unveiled a new smartphone - the Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition.\n\nThis is the fifth handset launched in the past twelve months running Ubuntu, according to Canonical. It's also the highest-end Ubuntu phone to date.\n\nLike the Android-running iteration of the PRO 5, the Ubuntu Edition comes with a 5.7-inch 1080p AMOLED touchscreen, a 21 MP rear camera with phase detection autofocus and dual-tone LED flash, a 5 MP front camera, Samsung's Exynos 7420 chipset at the helm (with an octa-core CPU clocked at up to 2.1 GHz), 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and dual-SIM slots.\n\nUbuntu's official listing doesn't mention the battery capacity, but since all of the other specs are 100% identical to those of the Android version of the phone, we assume it will be a 3,050 mAh cell in this case too. 4G LTE should be supported as well.\n\nThe Meizu PRO 5 Ubuntu Edition will go up for pre-order internationally at some point during MWC next week. Pricing information hasn't been revealed yet.", "NEW DELHI: A little-known company from Uttar Pradesh launched the world's cheapest smartphone, which will cost Rs 251 for a device with a 4-inch display, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB internal memory and dual-SIM option. But the launch by Ringing Bells, an agro-commodity trading company, was mired in controversy right from the word go.\n\nAlleging unfair price under-cutting, the mobile manufacturers association is calling for a government probe into the costing of the phone. Eyebrows were also raised at the similiarity in looks between the phone and Apple's iconic iPhone.\n\nNotwithstanding the controversies, the unveiling of the device - Freedom 251 -- generated quite a flutter in the market as its pricing has the potential to disrupt the volume-laden and fast-growing Indian smartphone market. Bookings for the Freedom 251 - which will be assembled at a factory in Noida while the parts come from Taiwan - will open on February 18 from 6am (online at www.freedom251.com) and close on February 21 at 8pm. The company says deliveries will be completed by June 30.\n\nA regular 3G device in the market currently costs no less than Rs 3,000, which it itself seen as very aggressive. A large swathe of device makers, including companies like Micromax, Samsung, Lava, Karbonn and DataWind are already selling devices in this category, but at much higher prices than the Freedom 251.\n\nThe company behind the Freedom 251 said it is being developed in sync with the Modi government's 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' initiatives and would help bring down the affordability of smartphones by a large degree. \"However, we are not receiving any subsidy from the government or any other official agency,\" a senior official of Ringing Bells said.\n\nSo how has the company managed to get a near-magical figure for a device that runs on a 1.3GHz quad-core processor device, and comes with a charger, headphones, screen-guard and a one-year warranty while also carrying a 3.2-megapixel back camera, 0.3-megapixel front camera, and a 1450mAh battery?\n\n\"We are working on a variety of cost-saving initiatives to keep the cost of the devices lower than its approximate per unit price of Rs 2,500. These include local assembling in India that saves us around Rs 400, large-scale sourcing that saves around Rs 400-500, online sales with no on-ground staff that itself saves us around Rs 500. The rest of the savings come in from an online marketplace that we create on our website by allowing other companies on the platform,\" Ashok Chadha of Ringing Bells said.\n\nHowever, industry experts said the device is being sourced from Adcom, a Delhi-based importer of IT products which is already available at some e-commerce websites, but at a higher cost.\n\nThe Indian Cellular Association (ICA) - which has members such as Samsung, Apple, Sony, Lava, Micromax, Karbonn, Motorola and HTC -- said the pricing and the way it has been subsidized needs to be investigated.\n\nIn a letter to telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, ICA said the government should go in-depth into the pricing mechanism. \"For your kind information, the bill of material (BOM) value for a product like this when sourced from the cheapest supply chain costs approximately USD 40 (Rs 2,700),\" ICA said. \"And this, when translated into retail price after addition of applicable duties, taxes and with distribution and retail margins would be at least Rs 4,100, while the product is being sold at Rs 251,\" ICA national president Pankaj Mohindroo said in the letter.\n\nDefence minister Manohar Parrikkar was earlier slated to be at the launch, but decided to give it a skip at the last minute.\n\nMeanwhile, Ringing Bells said that it would aggressively open multiple factories in the country. \"We design and produce smartphones to provide a satisfying mobile experience for users, so that their valuable time is spent doing things/tasks they love, instead of figuring out ways to use the phone. We have a complete in-house product testing set-up in India,\" the company said, adding that it would offer apps for women's safety, fishermen and farmers and others such as 'swachh bharat' pre-loaded on the device.

There's a wider edge panel for the S6 Edge, while users will be able to more easily move around icons and access applications.\n\nSamsung also talked up Samsung Internet 4.0, which \"now offers a Secret mode, so users can use the Internet freely without leaving behind a trail of information -- no browsing history, cookies, passwords, auto-fill data or anything else.\" Secret mode also includes fingerprint-sensor support to protect sensitive data.\n\nSamsung also touted some of the other important features baked into Marshmallow, including two new power-saving functions, called Doze Mode and App Standby Mode.\n\nThe update rollout comes just days before Samsung will hold its Unpacked event at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where the company is expected to unveil the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung is hoping the devices will offset some of its recent market share losses at the hands of Apple and Huawei, among others. Until then, keep an eye out for Marshmallow.", "While the possibility of a new 4-inch iPhone tends to capture the headlines, that new iPad just may be the more important of the announcements.\n\nHere's what we're expecting Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook to show off come March 15.\n\nWhile iPhones get all the glory for driving Apple's phenomenal success, the iPad is Apple's second largest source of revenue. And rather than facing the threat of a maturing market and declining sales as the iPhone does, the iPad is already taking a hit in a big way, with sales down 25% year-over-year.\n\nThe iPad Pro was one attempt to turn the situation around, but the specific market it addresses -- professional users -- opted for the Microsoft (MSFT) Surface Pro. For most consumers, the iPad Air is the tablet of choice.\n\nThe current generation iPad Air hasn't been updated in nearly a year-and-a-half, but that hasn't been a huge concern because of the second problem with Apple iPads: people hold on to them for years instead of buying new ones as they do with iPhones.\n\nApple needs the new iPad Air to be good enough to convince shoppers looking at a Samsung (SSNLF) Galaxy Tab, Surface 3 or a $49.99 Fire tablet from Amazon (AMZN) to go with its offering instead. Just as critical, the new iPad Air has to offer a compelling reason for all those existing iPad owners to finally trade up from their older iPads and buy an Air 3.\n\nThere are certain things we've come to expect from any Apple release, and a new A-series processor with a big leap in performance is a given.\n\nWhen Apple released the iPad Air 2, it touted a 40% processing improvement compared to the original iPad Air, with more than double the graphical performance. So expect the iPad Air 3 to use an A9 or A9X CPU and be considerably faster than its predecessor. Beyond that basic assumption, there are several key new features being speculated about on Apple iPad rumor tracking sites:\n\nThe Smart Connector is the key feature here. This is a new two-way magnetic interface introduced with the iPad Pro that lets an iPad use accessories while providing them with power. It's the Smart Connector that makes Apple's Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro and similar accessories from third parties possible.", "It wouldn't be a typical week in the Kanye West hype machine without some head-scratching moments. This time around they included a Bill Cosby endorsement and a second Taylor Swift feud.\n\nBut on Saturday night, prior to releasing his eighth studio album and performing on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the rapper disclosed perhaps his biggest shocker yet when he revealed that he was $53 million in debt.\n\nThe 38-year-old West made the claim on Twitter shortly before the highly anticipated album premiered exclusively on Tidal and his website.\n\n\"I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt,\" he tweeted. \"Please pray we overcome. ... This is my true heart.\"\n\nThe \"Life of Pablo\" album download, however, was taken down quickly Sunday after less than 12 hours online, with the rapper explaining that he'd given the exclusive stream to Tidal for another week before going on sale to other outlets -- a sign that the multi-Grammy winner was likely in dire straits.\n\nAfter the \"Life of Pablo\" download link had disappeared, he wrote, \"Please for all music lovers. Please subscribe to tidal!!! I decided not to sell my album for another week. Please subscribe to tidal.\"\n\nTidal, the Jay-Z backed streaming service, recently paid Rihanna an undisclosed fee for her latest album, \"Anti,\" though the February release was bungled when someone inside her camp leaked it online. Samsung reportedly paid $25 million to be a part of the campaign.\n\nWest, who's married to reality TV star Kim Kardashian, has been putting tens of millions into his fashion label. According to Business Insider, his latest clothing line is selling high-end coats and jackets for as much as $3,000 to $4,000.

It's not a millionaire sport and I'm proud of the debt,\" he boasted.\n\nOn Sunday morning, West asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to invest $1 billion in his ideas because he is \"the greatest living artist and the greatest artist of all time.\"\n\nIn yet another strange twist in the Kanye-\"Life of Pablo\" saga, pharmaceutical exec Martin Shkreli claimed he had been scammed out of $15 million in an attempt to buy exclusive rights to West's new album.\n\n\"Someone named Daquan said he was Kanye's boy and I signed the deal to buy 'Pablo' and sent the Bitcoin.

The handset, which is the fruits of an ongoing partnership between Meizu and Ubuntu creators Canonical, features a roster of top-shelf specs and will look to take on the smartphone heavy hitters when it goes on sale during MWC 2016.\n\nYou would be forgiven for not immediately recognising the name: in the UK, Meizu is not a household brand name like Samsung, Sony and Apple. However, it is one of a number of Chinese manufacturers that are increasingly challenging the rule of the market leaders by bringing out high-end devices at half the cost. OnePlus and Xiaomi are some of the most well-known examples.\n\nAnd the Meizu Pro 5 is high-end. With an octa-core Exynos 7420 processor clocked at 2.1GHz and up to 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, this is no knock-off and is easily comparable to the latest handsets from Samsung, Sony and HTC in terms of raw power. On top of that, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition comes with a 5.7-inch, full HD AMOLED display, 21-megapixel camera, a fingerprint sensor and a choice of 32 or 64GB internal storage, meaning the handset has more than enough to take on the mobile big boys.\n\nYou can already buy the standard version of the Meizu Pro 5, which runs Android and was made available worldwide last November, with prices starting at \u00a3303 ($434, \u20ac390). Pricing details on the Ubuntu Edition have yet to be announced however, given Chinese manufacturers' typical strategy of undercutting its mainstream rivals - often by hundreds of pounds - you can count on the device coming in at less that the expected asking price of smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, HTC One M10 and LG G5.\n\nThis could be a smartphone to keep an eye on, so stay tuned for more details when MWC 2016 touches down in Barcelona on 22 February.", "Offering a flagship level design and build quality, as well as certain useful features, the Galaxy A7 is a solid smartphone. However, given the current landscape in the budget-friendly category, the device does feel overpriced, especially when considering the tough competition it is going up against.\n\nWhen the Galaxy A line was first introduced by Samsung more than year ago, the series brought with it the company's first experimentation with build materials, with all these smartphone being made entirely of metal. Since then, Samsung seems to have found a more definite path in terms of design and build quality, but the Galaxy A series continues to be a way for Samsung to bring flagship characteristics to a more budget-friendly package.\n\nSEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy A9 review\n\nWhile the devices that are a part of the 2016 edition of the series are available in a variety of sizes and offer differing specifications and features, what we're looking at here is one of the more high-end offerings of the line, overshadowed by only the even more premium and newly-introduced Samsung Galaxy A9. What does this other Galaxy A device have to offer? We find out, in this in-depth Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) review!\n\nIn terms of design and build quality, what the Samsung Galaxy A7 is essentially is a overgrown Galaxy S6, with the former featuring a similar design language and identical construction as the latter. Other than the size, the Galaxy A7 is a little more angular in its shape as well, with less rounded corners, but there is definitely an element of familiarity to it. The Galaxy A7 may not pack as much when it comes to power and features when compared to its flagship counterpart, but you do certainly get the look and feel of a premium high-end phone here.\n\nYou've got glass panels on the front and back that are held together with a smooth, chamfered metal frame that rounds out along the top and bottom, but flattens out along the sides, as is also seen with the Galaxy S6. While the predominant presence of glass does make for a somewhat slippery device, the flat metal sides help a lot with the grip. Glass is also pretty atrocious when it comes to keeping fingerprints and smudges at bay, so you'll have to make an effort to keep the device looking pristine, unless you pick up the white version, where these are not as noticeable.\n\nAs expected, everything else is in its typical positions for a Samsung phone. The power button and volume rocker are to right and left respectively, and the metal-clad buttons offer a good amount of tactile feedback. With the Galaxy A7 being a touch more budget-friendly, it is not surprising that some flagship features, like the heart rate monitor on the back, are missing. However, you do get a fingerprint scanner here, once again integrated into the physical home button up front, which is flanked by the capacitive back and Recent Apps keys. At the bottom is the headphone jack, the microUSB port, and the single speaker unit.\n\nWith its 5.5-inch display, the Galaxy A7 is a decently-sized smartphone, and if you are switching from another device with a similar screen size, you'll feel right at home with the Galaxy A7 in your hand. Samsung has also done a great job with keeping the bezels along the sides of the display very thin, and along with its thin profile, one-handed use with the Galaxy A7 is a lot more comfortable that what you'd expect. With a weight of 172 grams, the Galaxy A7 is also on the heavier side, and allows for a solid and substantial feel while holding the device, making the slippery glass backing less of a worry.\n\nThe Galaxy A7 comes with a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display, with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 401 ppi. Quad HD may be considered the new standard, but Full HD more than just gets the job done, with Super AMOLED also playing its part in creating a great viewing experience. Everything from saturated, punchy colors, to the deep inky blacks are seen here, along with good viewing angles and brightness that allows for comfortable outdoor visibility. Web browsing, reading text, watching videos, or playing games are all very enjoyable on this screen, and you certainly won't find yourself missing a higher resolution.\n\nUnder the hood, this version of the Galaxy A7 comes with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, clocked at 1.5 GHz, and backed by the Adreno 405 GPU and 3 GB of RAM, but depending on the market, there is also an iteration that is powered by the octa-core Exynos 7580 processor, and backed by the Mali-T720MP2 GPU. In the case of this Snapdragon-powered review unit, the performance has been what you'd expect from this processing package, which has been the 2015 mid-range standard.\n\nIt runs reasonably well for the most part, and handles everything from web-browsing to multi-tasking, and even graphically-intensive gaming, perfectly well. However, there are occasional instances of animation stutter throughout the interface. It is very noticeable when it does happen, and the lag is almost always seen when moving from the Flipboard second screen to the main homescreen. Granted the latter is an issue with the high-end Samsung devices as well, but with the slower chipset in play here, the stutter is far more apparent. Some sluggishness is also seen when scrolling the pages and elements of certain apps, such as Snapchat.\n\n16 GB of on-board storage is the only option available here, but luckily, Samsung decided to bring expandable storage back into the fold with the Galaxy A series, allowing for an additional storage capability via microSD card by up to 128 GB. Some versions of the device, depending on the market, also come with dual-SIM capabilities, in which case the secondary SIM slot is what serves as the microSD card slot. In the single SIM versions of the phone, a dedicated microSD card slot is to be found.\n\nAs mentioned, the Galaxy A7 comes with a fingerprint scanner that is integrated into the tactile home button up front. This is the same implementation as seen with the Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 before it, and works well. The setup process is a little longer when compared to some competing devices out there, but once you're ready to go, the scanner is reliable, accurate, and generally pretty fast at unlocking the phone. Apart from unlocking the device, the fingerprint reader also sees its advantage when being used with Samsung Pay.\n\nThe single speaker unit is found at the same position at the bottom, as is the case with its flagship counterparts, and offers a similar sound quality. While the speaker gets decently loud and produces a clean and clear sound without any distortion even at higher volumes, you are of course, not getting the quality that is available with dual front-facing speaker setups.\n\nThe Galaxy A7 comes with a standard suite of connectivity options, including NFC. However, as far as network connectivity is concerned, there are quite a few versions of the device floating around, but unfortunately, none of them are intended for the US market, which means that you'll have a hard time getting any sort of 4G LTE connectivity with the Galaxy A7. HSPA+ does get the job done, but for those that definitely want LTE in the US, this smartphone will unfortunately fall out of consideration.\n\nMoving on to the battery, the Galaxy A7 comes with a large 3,300 mAh unit that provides a battery life that has been extremely good. With normal usage, the device comfortably lasted through a full day of use, and more often than not, survived an additional half a day as well. The screen-on time has been easily surpassing the 4 hour mark, and has been around 5 hours on most days. Wireless charging may not be available, but the Galaxy A7 does come with fast charging capabilities, which is useful when needing to quickly recharge a battery of this size. The Galaxy S6 has been plagued with battery life issues, but seeing as to how Samsung seems to have figured this aspect out with the Galaxy A series, is hopefully a pre-cursor for what we can expect with the upcoming Galaxy S7.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints with Samsung's high-end offerings last year was the camera bulge, and while it hasn't been completely eliminated with the Galaxy A7, the protrusion of the camera lens is significantly smaller this time around, and from an aesthetics standpoint, it definitely looks a lot cleaner.\n\nThe Galaxy A7 comes with a 13 MP rear camera with a f/1.9 aperture and optical image stabilization, but as you'd expect the camera experience doesn't quite live up to what you'll find on Samsung's flagship devices. The camera doesn't come with video recording capabilities in 4K, there is no Youtube live streaming feature, as well as no HDR Auto. The HDR toggle on the main camera interface is also missing, which makes switching between Auto mode and HDR and little more cumbersome than I'd like. What is retained, however, is the ability to quickly launch the camera with a simple double tap of the home button, a feature that was first introduced with the Galaxy S6.\n\nAs far as image quality is concerned, the shots possible with the Galaxy A7 are unfortunately mediocre at best. You can get some good looking photos in the right lighting conditions, but even when the environment is too bright, you will see a lot of overblown highlights and crushed shadows. The Galaxy A7 also seems to lack the typical Samsung post processing that results in vibrant colors and sharpness, making for images that appear quite dull. HDR mode does provide a more balanced shot and adds a slight boost to the colors, but without HDR Auto, you will have to remember to switch to HDR mode every time the camera is launched.\n\nYou will also see a lot of noise creeping in to the shots in medium to low light situations. Details begin to look extremely soft, colors are lacking, and you are still getting the overblown highlights that are seen in pictures taken in bright conditions. The camera of the Galaxy A7 is one that will get the job done, but is far cry from what Samsung has shown themselves to be capable of.\n\nOn the software side of things, the Galaxy A7 is running Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box, with the latest version of TouchWiz on top. While it is disappointing to see Android 6.0 Marshmallow not available on a device launched in 2016, a planned upgrade to the latest version of Android is in the works, and should make its way over shortly. This is the newer version of TouchWiz with the squarish circle icons, as seen with the Galaxy Note 5, and personally the look I prefer. The general look and feel of TouchWiz remains largely the same though, and the software experience is pretty much identical to what is available with something like the Galaxy S6.\n\nMulti-window is available to cover all your split screen multi-tasking needs, there are useful motion gestures included, such as the swiping your palm over the screen to take a screenshot, a one-handed mode can be activated by a triple tap of the home button, and finally, the robust theme store is also found this time around. The theme store remains one of the best additions to the TouchWiz UI, and with numerous themes to choose from, you can easily cater the look and feel of the UI to your liking.\n\nThe Galaxy A7 hasn't officially been launched in the US, but can be found on eBay from anywhere in the $400 - $500 range, depending on your preference of color, with a choice between gold, pink, white, and black.\n\nSo there you have it for this closer look at the Samsung Galaxy A7! The Galaxy A7 certainly falls towards the higher-end of the \"budget-friendly\" spectrum, especially if you are trying to import it to the US. At this price range, a lot of other great options are available as well, including devices like the OnePlus X, Nexus 5X, the Moto X Pure Edition, honor 5X, and for a little extra, even the Nexus 6P. Not only will you potentially getting a device that is more powerful with these choices, but also one that will allow for full 4G LTE connectivity in the states.\n\nFor those considering picking up the device in other markets, the Galaxy A7 is a solid smartphone that brings a lot of flagship features to a more affordable package. From its premium design and build quality, to the availability of a fingerprint reader, the Galaxy A7 does tick the right boxes, but it is certainly far from a bargain. Considering how much the budget smartphone landscape has changed in just a short period of time, Samsung may have to reconsider a few things in order to allow the Galaxy A7 a fighting chance.", "The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones won't be the only products Samsung shows off at Mobile World Congress. The South Korean electronics giant will also debut a new pair of connected smart shoes. The shoes, called Iofit, were developed by Salted Venture, a startup that is backed by Samsung.\n\nWe've seen connected shoes before from companies like Under Armour and Altra, but the Iofit sneakers look to take a different approach. Whereas past smart sneakers focused on activity and run tracking, Salted Venture's shoe is all about improving balance and body posture.\n\nThe shoe is equipped with built-in sensors to measure pressure and movement. It also includes Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with a companion app that will provide coaching to enhance your strength training and your golf swing.\n\nThe app displays results in real time and can provide audio coaching to help users fix their form. You can also video record your workouts to receive customized coaching and analysis, as well as the ability to compare your video side-by-side with another. The company highlighted in a press release how this feature could allow users to work with a trainer regardless of their location.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign will be launched later this year for preorders. The fitness sneakers are expected to cost $149, while the golf shoes will cost $199.

We believe Wall Street continues to discount a weak spending outlook in 2016 based on macroeconomic concerns and expectations of a meaningful dropoff in memory spending. However, because spending this year is largely strategic in nature (10nm FinFET, transition to 3D NAND, 1Xnm [process technology between 19nm and 10nm] DRAM later this year), we are less concerned about a large decline in spending that we believe the Street is currently discounting, and this should drive a positive bias in semiconductor-capital-equipment (semicap) stocks.

This sounds impressive, but where does the Huawei Mate 8 stand in relation to today's market? This review will show you the pro and cons of this true large-display phone.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 8 is an all-metal/glass phone that uses the proven design language of the company's most successful handsets such as the Mate 7, Mate S or the Huawei Honor 7.\n\nFrom a distance, all look similar, but a closer look reveals that the aluminum alloy used in the Mate 8 feels more premium and the sides use brushed metal now. These are subtle things that can be felt and contribute to a more pleasing handling of the phone.\n\nThe design of the camera module cover is also much nicer, with concentrically brushed metal and more compact/elegant dual LED flash housing. The fingerprint sensor has a larger sensing surface, but occupy a lower overall footprint, thanks to the narrower and circular bezel. The fingerprint sensor performance is also much better, and we'll get to that in the \"Software\" section.\n\nBut that's not it: the back cover functions at the top and bottom are more subtle, with no visible antenna gap in the back (it's been pushed to the side). The speaker design is also much better, with the speaker grill carved in the aluminum at the bottom of the phone, instead of using a grill made of small holes in the back. Cherry on the cake: the USB port is now perfectly centered.\n\nThe display's glass uses a 2.5D beveled glass which makes the phone feel softer (no sharp edges) and even a little thinner (that's only a perception) and more agreeable to hold, overall. Without a doubt, Huawei has been working hard to refine noticeably its visual identity, but without changing an overall formula that has proven extremely popular in certain markets.\n\nLet's jump directly to one of the strong points of the Huawei Mate 8: its large 4000 mAh battery. This is the reason of being for the Mate series, which has been designed and optimized for longer battery life from the get go, and this goes much farther than just putting a large battery, thanks to additional power management tools.\n\nThe sheer capacity of the battery remains the primary factor for battery life (within a platform, like Android). Since everyone's usage model will differ, all the battery tests will at best provide an indicator of how the phone's battery life will be, but never a realistic portrait of your potential experience. As far as capacity goes, the Mate 8 impresses and the chart below will speak for itself.\n\nSince the Huawei Mate 8 isn't sold directly on GetHuawei.com in the U.S, the street prices hover around ~$625. At this price, the battery capacity relative to the price could be better, and you can see a number of phones offering more capacity for each dollar spent, so the Mate 8 will dominate mainly in \"absolute\" capacity.\n\nHuawei's Honor 7 offers a great battery for the price ratio. I would also recommend that you look at the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 (~$640), which has a 3760 mAh capacity. If you don't mind going some something older, the Huawei Mate 7 offers a much better battery capacity for the price than the Honor 7.\n\nWith a charge speed of 49.33 mAh/mn, the Huawei Mate 8 ranks among the fastest-charging devices. With its default charger, it can recharge as fast as the Galaxy S6 or the Galaxy Note 5. For example, the Nexus 6P is slightly slower and both the LG G4 and the Honor 7 are far behind. It's rare to see a phone charge faster than 50 mAh/mn, but the Galaxy S6 Edge+ tops 52 mAh/mn in our tests.\n\nKeep in mind that like other batteries, the charging speed of the Mate 8 is linear from about 0% to 85% (~75mn) then slows down radically until it hits 100%. If you're on a clock, that's your sweet spot there.\n\nAs usual for the Mate line of products, it is possible to use the Mate 8 as a battery pack to charge a friend's phone (the ultimate battery dominance), since its 4000 mAh battery is 2.33X larger than the iPhone 6S' 1715 mAh battery.\n\nHuawei offers battery management features that may not be available to other handsets. For example, it's very simple to prevent (or allow) specific apps from using data in the background. Apps such as Facebook and FB Messenger have been repeatedly accused of draining battery, just to cite the most famous one.\n\nMany other chat apps will consume more data than users may think. By allowing only \"critical apps\" (according to your own criteria) to use data in the background, the user can set his/her priorities. Knowledge and simplicity can lead to much greater battery efficiency.\n\nThe battery manager also identifies apps that are power-hungry. In the context of this review, the benchmark apps were quickly flagged as such, but Microsoft Outlook wasn't expected to be one of those, so this was a surprise.\n\nHuawei has been unapologetic in its use of FHD (Full HD = 1080p = 1920\u00d71080) instead of higher resolutions such as 2560\u00d71440, mainly to save battery life, but it has the side-effect of optimizing costs as well.\n\nWhile it is true that having more pixels inherently requires more energy (more light and more pixels to process), LG had demonstrated with the LG G3 (the first 2560\u00d71440 handset) that the battery life cost is far from proportional to the increase in pixel density because there are strategies to attenuate the energetic impact. In other words, it's not that bad.\n\nNonetheless, Huawei has sided on the side of absolute battery life, so we'll respect its choice, although we would love to know more about the estimated battery life gain of this decision.\n\nAs we have said in other reviews, the impact of higher resolution (measured in PPI) is most positively felt for photo/video capture and replay, and while reading small text. In other situations, having a higher PPI display is nice, but not important enough to significantly deteriorate the user experience. To better understand what PPI is about, read our definition.\n\nResolution side, the image quality (color, contrast, saturation) of the 6\" IPS LCD display is excellent. The LCD display quality is very high and is very comparable, if not slightly better than LG's V10 handset, which is also a large-display multimedia centric phone.\n\nThe protecting glass for the display is a 2.5D glass, which means that it has a soft edge on all sides. This makes the phone more agreeable to hold and looks a bit more luxurious. It also takes more time and costs money to build, so it's a nice touch.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 8 uses a Sony IMX298 16MP sensor module with an optical image stabilization camera module (OIS). The lens has an f2.0 aperture (pinhole size) which is good, although not the absolute largest. For example, the Galaxy S6 Edge+ has an aperture of f1.9. Don't let the small numerical difference fool you, sometimes the difference can be noticed.\n\nInterestingly, we found during our tests that the Google Nexus 6P (also built by Huawei) takes slightly better pictures, despite being earlier later in the year (DxOmark ranked it second-best at some point). It's not better by much, but just enough to keep the Mate 8 out of Ubergizmo's Best Phones Cameras update of January 2016 for which it was considered.\n\nIn absolute terms, the Huawei Mate 8 has a very good camera, and you have to zoom in up close to see definite differences with the best out there. Huawei doesn't manage noise, sharpness or color balance exactly the same way Samsung and others do. Some of this is a matter of personal preferences, as photography is not 100% science.\n\nIn the end, most people would be very happy with the results, but it's a tough world when you compete with the best. Right now, the Galaxy S series keeps the pole position, with a small group of elite phones in hot-pursuit.\n\nFrom a technological standpoint, the Mate 8 is now using Huawei's image signal processor (ISP) which is embedded in the HiSilicon Kirin 950 chip (HiSilicon is part of the Huawei conglomerate). This is an interesting change that may signal a tighter cooperation between the camera, product and ISP teams in the future. Take a look at our full-size Mate 8 photo samples on Flickr.\n\nThe front camera uses an 8 Megapixel IMX179 Sony sensor, with an f2.4 lens and it's been confirmed by Huawei that it is the exact same sensor used for Huawei P8 and the Nexus 6P.\n\nAs usual, Huawei's has built selfie features such as a small control window to make sure that you are looking at the right place, use the fingerprint sensor in the back as a trigger to reduce shakes.\n\nThere's a built-in \"beauty mode\" as well, which will \"retouch\" the photo to give you a better skin tone, etc... Sometimes it feels like it's too much, but it does remove quite a few imperfections. I asked Ubergizmo's co-founder Hubert Nguyen, to test it. You can see the eye bags etc... being blurred out. Not bad - what do you think?\n\nThe Mate 8 was the first non-Google phone launched with Android 6.0, but don't expect to find the Google \"stock user interface\" inside. Huawei is using its own Emotion UI (EMUI version 4.0) in this handset, and it comes with a some strengths of its own.\n\nFirst of all, I don't think that the difference with other Android handsets will throw users off. Icons design aside, the most visible difference is that Huawei does not distinguish between the home page and the apps screen. Every app you install will show up on the home screen, and you can build folders to organize them, just like on any other Android device.\n\nThe settings screens are clear, and the search box lets you quickly find a specific setting without going through the menu. Samsung introduced that a couple of years ago, and I'm glad to see more and more OEMs include a similar search.\n\nHuawei says that it has worked on improving the responsiveness of the UI by reducing the latency in-between user input and visual reaction. Data presented by Huawei suggested an improvement of 33% going from 150ms down to 100ms in reaction time.\n\nThe speed-up happens in a number of locations within the software, from the Input Process which now starts earlier, to the First frame Process and the Display which have both been reduced. It's nice to know that some OEMs are keeping track of this because responsiveness is key to a good user experience.\n\nHuawei has also made sure that both screenshots and screen recording were easy and built-in. Of course, the usual Android screenshot methods still work. But Huawei has added a Knock to Capture to select a specific area of the screen to capture (left image), and a two-knuckle gesture to trigger video capture (middle and right images).\n\nI found the video-capture to be very handy for educational purposes when you want to show someone how an app works, or how to do something specific with the operating system. Normally, you could also download an app to do it, but it's convenient to have one integrated.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor of the Huawei Mate 8 performs extremely well, and can unlock the phone faster than the Galaxy S6 or LG V10 phones can - just to cite two popular ones. Also, here's no need to turn the phone ON before using the fingerprint reader. Just touching it will do both.\n\nBecause the sensor is in the back, it doesn't take previous space away from the design, which lets the phone achieve a great screen-to-body ratio.\n\nHuawei also lets the phone owner lock a specific app or document to protect one's privacy. I have to admit that I don't use this often because I lock my phone to everyone else, but this feature could be very useful for parents who let their kids play with the phone from time to time.\n\nAs a productivity tool, Huawei made it super-easy to scan people's cards and add them to your contact list. Simply take a photo, and the integrated software will try to read the card and classify name, email, phone number, etc...\n\nFrom there, a complete contact can be added to your contact list. It worked well during our tests. Now, if the industry could rally around a contact format that would integrate the text information, but also photos (of the two sides) of the business card, that would be grand.\n\nOne can never be sure of how often phones get updated by their manufacturers, but since we've had the Mate 7 in the office, the phone has been updated quite often, with a lot of updates shortly after the launch at CES, but also every couple of weeks or so afterward. This is a very good sign.\n\nThere are many more software features in the Huawei Mate 8, but we think that the ones described here are the most important, and most likely to be at the top of your list.\n\nThe Mate 8 is powered by the relatively new HiSilicon Kirin 950. Announced in early November, this processor will power many Huawei handsets in 2016. There are a number of upgrades since the Kirin 935, but the important ones are:\n\nAltogether, this makes the Kirin 950 chip a very good upgrade from the previous generation, and it is interesting to see how fast HiSilicon is evolving. When associated with Huawei's LTE capabilities, this creates a powerful combo that few companies in the world can rival.\n\nOn the CPU side, the Huawei Mate 8 beats current high-end phones such as the Galaxy S6 series and Huawei's own Nexus 6P (Snapdragon 810) in tests such as Geekbench. It also gets very good overall system performance scores (Basemark OS 2), which is a pretty decent proxy for non-gaming performance.\n\nAs for graphics (3D games), the results aren't as impressive: the Mate 8 remains noticeably slower than 2015 high-end phones such as the S6, iPhone or Nexus 6P. It can of course run casual games very well, but heavy 3D games can be played at a higher framerate with other handsets.\n\nIn 2016, the competition remains very stiff, however. We don't yet have actual performance numbers for the 2016 Samsung Exynos chip, but Snapdragon 820 is already seen in the wide, thanks to phones such as the LeTV Max Pro or Qualcomm's own Snapdragon 820 MDP development handset.\n\nWith a U.S street price of around $625, the Huawei Mate 8 is well within the pricing range of 2015 high-end phones ($665 for the S6 Edge+, $650 for the iPhone 6s and only $455 for the Galaxy S6), so there's no obvious advantage there.\n\nUnlike many other Huawei handsets, the Mate 8 should be thought of as high-end phones and evaluated mainly on its absolute performance and features. At this point, there's no pricing, or \"value for the price\" advantage.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 8 is a very good handset across the board, but its main strengths reside in its impressive battery capacity and proprietary UX (user experience). The design bias towards superior battery life should be the primary factor in most purchase decisions, and it's not hard to see why.\n\nWe liked certain aspects of the software very much, as there are a ton of little details that make a real difference in the day-to-day usage (alarm, screenshots, voice recorder and more).\n\nWe wish that Huawei would make some of these utilities available in Google's Market, just to give a taste to new users. The Mate 8 was also the first non-Google Android handset to feature Android 6.0, and this shows Huawei's expertise in the matter.\n\nHuawei has certainly carved a very interesting segment for itself with the Mate 8, and we're looking forward to seeing how the competition will react to it. Right now, the Motorola Droid Turbo 2 does a fair job of competing in battery capacity and has better graphics speed. However, the Mate 8 beats the Droid Turbo 2 in raw CPU speed, has better overall system performance, Android 6.0 and an even larger battery.", "After test-driving a Samsung Gear VR headset for several weeks, I am convinced this technology will soar to eye-bending heights, especially in entertainment fields such as filmmaking and gaming. I'm watching an animated assassin tangle with Jack the Ripper in a 19th-century London kitchen, and I look around to see pots and pans fly by me, and I turn 360 degrees to see more stuff clatter behind me. As a voyeur, I'm enthralled and immersed so deeply in the scene, it's hard to tear myself away. Oh wait, I can't, because I have a headset on and only removing the device from my face would jump me out of the fight. Being absorbed by the trailer for Assassin's Creed Syndicate Jack the Ripper DLC made me a VR believer. I have since enjoyed videos on the Samsung VR app ranging from GoPro clips of guys surfing to Star Wars footage to short films reminiscent of early Alien. And with almost every video, where I spin around on a chair to see the full range of viewing angles available, I am enthralled by how advanced this tech has become since its nascent days. I remember two years ago when my colleague Michael and I first experienced VR at a Game of Thrones exhibit in downtown Toronto. It was cool, it was breathtaking, but was short-lived. We were taken atop the Wall to overlook the fantastical land below and we flinched when a catapulted fireball rocketed past us. It lasted around a minute Now, with Samsung Milk's app, more variety is spicing up the wow factor. I especially found it fascinating to be inside a real-world scenario, such as following a girl in Africa as she travels to a stream to get water for her home. Or sailing along the Ganges River in India, complete with close-up views of men washing themselves in the river as part of a religious ceremony. These VR sessions inspired me to consider how filmmaking can soar with virtual applications. Documentaries are especially conducive to VR, where the viewer can be placed in a situation like a war zone and almost feel the tension and chaos. Or a guided tour of an ancient city can be enhanced immensely in VR, where the ruins can almost feel touchable. I admit, more than once I reached out my hand during a VR session expecting my real hand to appear in the footage I was enjoying. Fictional filmmaking would also benefit from touches of VR, but a major caveat here: I could handle around 15 minutes of VR maximum before I felt a little dizzy, even nauseous. Our brains are just not accustomed to this type of technology, not yet at least. And so filmmaking can definitely take that innovative leap with short films, either animated or real-life. I can see how the VR film will be unlike any film in the world, where outside distractions don't impede your viewing entertainment, even if that does make us more isolated in a community of fellow film-goers. It's almost jaw-dropping to think about how gaming could harness VR. It might be available now in patches, but if gaming in VR matures enough to allow mass adoption for this tech, watch out! Imagine playing a game like Call of Duty as if you're actually a Navy SEAL, or imagine how haptic technology could let you feel the wind zipping by as you careen through a city in a racing game. Gaming could also be used for a more therapeutic purpose. PTSD sufferers have been trying VR to immerse themselves in exposure therapy in a manner that hasn't been done before. But what if VR can help those with mental health issues receive more appropriate training for new jobs? We know that training is often done across the board for all new staff, but if VR can help tailor certain training programs for those with special needs, then its holistic reason for existence is further justified. VR's potential is just starting to be realized, but if my weeks of testing is any indication, the future of virtual reality looks incredibly high-def...and in full 360-degree panorama.

Not the same.\" campaign, and it's nothing short of brilliant.\n\nLike all of Google's ads in this series, this one wants to remind us that Android offers choice. Whether you like your devices to be big or small, super pretty or tough and robust, made by Samsung or LG, you'll find something running Android that meets your needs.\n\nAnd when you get that device, you can endlessly customize it to suit you.\n\nChoose iOS, on the other hand, and you have a choice between iPhone and... well, iPhone. Sure, there are different sizes to choose from now, but they all deliver exactly the same experience, and your customization options are pretty limited.\n\nGoogle attempts to highlight that in the video below. \"A piano has 88 keys,\" the ad says. \"Each one is different. But what if they were all the same?\"", "Above: InVisage camera sensors can detect dark and light parts of an image.\n\nInVisage Technologies is announcing a new chip today that enables a new kind of high-quality security camera, better laptop cameras, and Internet of Things applications. It could open up new kinds of applications, such as a drone that can detect its environment and avoid colliding with anything in its way.\n\nThe new chip, SparkP2, is a stripped-down version of a more advanced image sensor that InVisage started producing last year. The SparkP2 can capture 2-megapixel images, which by itself isn't that big a deal. But it can also capture high dynamic range, or imagery with dark and light parts in the same image, and it can do so using just one-twentieth of the power of competing chips, said Remi Lacombe, vice president of sales and marketing at InVisage, in an interview with VentureBeat.\n\nThe sensor captures light in the near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It could be used in things like virtual reality sensors, drones, and webcam iris-detection cameras. The sensor has three times the ability to capture light, but uses a lot less power.\n\n\"This is a low-resolution sensor, and it is a very different market from our first chip,\" Lacombe said. \"Our solution is smaller and much cheaper. And we can take the power down 20 times.\"\n\nSparkP2 is available in samples in April and mass production is scheduled for the summer.\n\nInVisage launched its first chip, a high-end 13-megapixel sensor dubbed Quantum13, in November 2015. That chip was in the works for more than a decade, and it is targeted at smartphones that will be able to take pictures with high dynamic range, or images with both dark and light sections in the same picture. The QuantumFilm technology enables images to be much sharper, with twice the dynamic range, and be able to record 4K video. The opportunity for 13-megapixel cameras is expected to grow from 408 million units in 2015 to 995 million units in 2020, according to market researcher Techno Systems Research.\n\nBrian O'Rourke, analyst at market researcher IHS, said in an email, \"There's certainly opportunity here for InVisage. The types of use cases that they're going after, such as facial and iris recognition, depth-mapping and eye and gesture tracking, have a wide variety of imaging applications, from security to online banking to gaming. These will all benefit from better performance in the IR range. These applications should grow significantly over the next few years, from a limited current base. The barrier for InVisage is the strong, established companies that they will be competing against in the image sensor market, companies like Sony, Samsung, OmniVision and ON Semiconductor. As a start-up, it's extremely difficult to compete against companies that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue in your target market. You not only have to build a better mouse trap, but you have to be able to market it effectively.\"\n\nQuantumFilm is a light-sensitive layer on a digital camera's image sensor. It captures the light when you take a photograph and sends it to the electronics underneath. Conventional cameras use silicon chips to absorb light, but such chips (based on complementary metal oxide semiconductors, or CMOS) only capture about 25 percent of the light that hits the surface of the silicon.\n\nQuantumFilm uses tiny nano particles known as quantum dots. The QuantumFilm can absorb eight times more light than silicon, said Jess Lee, president and CEO of InVisage, in an interview with VentureBeat. That translates into a big quality improvement. Since the capture of light is so much more efficient, the entire system can be cheaper.\n\nMichael Palma, analyst at market researcher IDC, said in an email, \"We are seeing a shift from traditional photography and videography use cases into roles supporting a wide range of devices that will use images and video as part of their autonomous functions.\n\nHe added, \"From drones to self-driving cars, and from robots to surveillance cameras, we are seeing solutions launching that apply advanced image and video analytics to enable a device's autonomous action - whether it's to navigate a space or to send notifications to users. Additionally, user interface and authentication are additional use cases for image and video analytics. But all of these applications start with the image sensor.\"\n\nPalma also added,\"InVisage's solution appears compelling. The company claims a significant improvement in performance, with a smaller and lower cost solution compared to [traditional] image sensors. The question will be how well this technology performs in the market and how successful InVisage can market the solution.\"\n\nInVisage was founded in 2006, after several years of research at the University of Toronto.\n\nQuantumFilm and the accompanying quantum dot technology are byproducts of research into nanotechnology. The material was engineered from the outset to be good at light capture, the essential task of a camera. The material is \"tuned\" so that, when hit with light, it emits a different color. The quantum dots sit in suspension and can be splashed onto anything.\n\nJust nanometers in size (a nanometer is a billionth of a meter), a quantum-dot based material is deposited directly on top of a chip wafer (chips are processed in pizza-size wafers and then sliced into individual chips). QuantumFilm covers 100 percent of each pixel, capturing all light that hits it. The material is applied in liquid form to the top of a spinning disk, then it is annealed, or baked. It is a lot like adding a layer of photoresist to a chip wafer, and it uses the same equipment.\n\nBack in 2010, when we first wrote about InVisage at the DEMO conference, the company had hoped to ship its chips much earlier. But it ran into a number of snags while trying to scale the manufacturing up. That's one reason the company raised more money. In 2010, InVisage had raised $30 million. As of today, it has raised $120 million from the likes of GGV Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, RockPort Capital, InterWest Partners, Intel Capital, Oceanwide, and OnPoint Technologies.\n\nMuch like the 13-megapixel sensors, the 2-megapixel sensors will have the ability to capture details hidden in shadows as well as areas splashed with light in the same image, as in the picture at the top. Conventional security cameras often produce images with washed-out sections under similar conditions.\n\nRivals include Sony, Samsung, and other companies that have acquired previous competitors.\n\nQuantumFilm's high dynamic range mode provides up to three additional stops of dynamic range compared to traditional CMOS sensors. That means images that are sharper, compared to distorted images with conventional cameras.\n\nQuantumFilm also offers the world's first electronic global shutter for smartphones, a camera technology that enables full-frame capture instead of the cumbersome rolling shutter method that CMOS sensors use to scan from the top of the image to the bottom. With this electronic global shutter, Quantum Dot sensors can capture crisp still photos of fast-moving subjects at full-frame shutter speeds normally reserved for digital SLRs.\n\nAbout 75 people work for InVisage in an office in Menlo Park, California.", "The Samsung Galaxy S7 will be officially announced during the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, which starts on February 21. However, as Gizmodo notes, a commercial has (accidentally?) been found online. \"Samsung's next flagship smartphone has already been given the full leak treatment, but in case there was any doubt left, Samsung Indonesia has an unlisted teaser page and video. I assume this is a dumb leak, and not a desperate PR effort.\" Gizomodo adds that the commercial was probably meant to air on launch date, but that Samsung Indonesia hid the commercial on their site to get it ready. It's a very effective commercial that shows how the Galaxy S7 can fit the lifestyle of a fitness addict, even in the rain (the Galaxy S7 is waterproof). It looks like the woman in the video is using the Edge version of the Galaxy S7, which looks almost identical to the Galaxy S6 Edge. The video also shows wireless charging and the camera's ability to take pictures in low-light conditions. One of the biggest complaints about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S7 is that the 16MP camera on the S6 has now been reduced to 12MP. However, this is not as big of an issue as people think, especially since the amount of megapixels is only a small indicator of the quality of the picture. It's rumored that Samsung has improved everything else on their new smartphone camera and that's saying a lot, especially since the camera on the S6 series was already near perfection. According to Tech Insider, those who pre-order the Galaxy S7 will be given a very special gift. \"You'll get a free Gear VR headset if you pre-order the Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge...The Gear VR is a virtual reality (VR) headset that uses Samsung's latest flagship devices, including the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5, to play VR content.\"", "ZOTAC GeForce GTX 970 DirectX 12P 4GB PCI Express 3.0 x16 SLI Support G-SYNC Support Video Card - $287.99 w/4% off code AFMN0164 at Newegg.com, exp. 02/19\n\nG.SKILL RIPJAWS MX780 USB Wired RGB Laser Gaming Mouse + $5 off w/ promo code AFMN0167, limited offer\n\nNaim Mu-so Reference All-in-One Wireless Music System - Black Grille + $20 off w/ promo code AFMN0170, limited offer\n\nInFocus SP1080 1920 x 1080 DLP Projector 3000 (Eco) / 3500 (Normal) + Additional savings with promo code AFMN0165, ends 2/19\n\nGoPro HERO4 Silver CHDHY-401 Silver 12MP Action Camera - $354.99 w/$45 off code AFMN0171 at Newegg.com, exp. 02/19\n\nGarmin Vivosmart Wireless Activity Wristband with heart rate monitor $79.99 shipped (List Price $199) Use code SMARTHEALTH, Exp. 02/19\n\nRosewill RCDC-14034 DisplayPort Male to DVI Female Adapter + $3 off w/ promo code AFMN0161, limited offer\n\nMobile Exclusive: $51 OFF SAMSUNG 850 PRO 2.5\" 512GB SATA III 3-D Vertical Internal SSD - $198.99 w/ code MBL160217A at m.newegg.com or Newegg Mobile app. 2/17 Only.\n\nMobile Exclusive: $180 OFF LG 25UM57-P Black 25\" 5ms GTG HDMI Widescreen LED Backlight LCD Monitor IPS - $169.99 w/$10 code MBL160218B at m.newegg.com or Newegg Mobile app. 2/18 Only.\n\nThis story, \"Discount Codes for 2/17.

Seeking to improve uptake and use of its products, Windsor believes Google will assume responsibility for releasing firmware updates, a task currently left to handset makers and mobile carriers.\n\n\"Google will end up taking complete control of Android by moving the entire OS into its services layer known as Google Mobile Services (GMS). This is the only way that Google can end the endemic fragmentation that continues to plague its devices as well as take back control of software distribution,\" Windsor said.\n\n\"The net result is that a Google device will become much like an iOS or a Windows 10 device with absolutely no options for handset makers to make any changes.\"\n\nWindsor notes that despite coming out around the same time as Apple's iOS 9 update, Marshmallow currently runs on just 1.2 per cent of Android devices, according to Edison. The new iOS, meanwhile, is installed on 87 per cent of Apple devices, thanks to a tightly-controlled ecosystem that Apple lords over its mobile lineup.\n\nWithout the ability to get the latest version of the OS out to Android hardware, Google will be unable to release its new software and services. Windsor believes that, with this in mind, the Chocolate Factory will opt to take over Android and make sure handsets and tablets are able to use its new software releases.\n\n\"We suspect that this could also go hand-in-hand with Google becoming far more prescriptive in terms of hardware to ensure that its software runs properly,\" said the analyst.\n\n\"While this would be good for Google in terms of improving its user experience and its ability to monetise, it will be yet another nail in the coffin of the long-suffering handset makers, who have already been reduced to virtual commodities with only Samsung being able to earn more than 2-4 per cent margins on a sustainable basis.\"\n\nGoogle has already shown some signs of tightening its grip on Android.

He uses his Venmo app at least three times a month to pay his rent or reimburse a friend who picks up the check at dinner. \"I'll just Venmo them right then,\" says the 25-year-old San Francisco photographer. He's also been using Apple Pay in emergencies -- like the time he paid for gas when he forgot his wallet on a road trip. \"I think of it as I am using Apple Pay\" rather than Bank of America, says Silva, who's linked his account at the lender with Apple Pay.\n\nThat attitude concerns financial institutions, which believe mobile payment services such as Venmo and Apple Pay could erode loyalty, particularly among millennials, who surveys show are more prone to switching banks than their elders. \"The biggest risk for them is their relationship with their customer,\" says Zilvinas Bareisis, a senior analyst at Celent, a consulting firm. Surprisingly, most banks aren't putting up much of a fight. Only 5 percent of U.S. banks Celent polled in November had a branded wallet app that works in stores for Android phones, and just 17 percent planned to release one in the coming 6 to 12 months. (Most third-party in-store wallets are incompatible with iPhones.)\n\nMany institutions seem prepared to cede the field to Google, Apple, and Samsung, all of which have a head start. Apple Pay, introduced in 2014, appears to be getting the most traction in the U.S., where some 12 million people use it at least once a month, a number that should more than double, to 25 million, by yearend, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.\n\nApple Pay isn't the first digital payment technology to pose a challenge for the banking industry -- pioneer PayPal has been around since 1998. But the stakes are much bigger now that Walmart stores, Starbucks cafes, and Chevron gas stations are among those retooling to handle payments through digital wallets. Researcher EMarketer estimates the value of transactions made by tapping or waving a phone at the point of sale will reach $210 billion by 2019, up from $8.7 billion last year.\n\n\"We see a day when customers are leaving their home without their card,\" says Jonathan Velline, head of ATM and store strategy at Wells Fargo. Already, 82 percent of banks are concerned about ensuring that theirs becomes or stays the most-used card in the digital wallet, while 61 percent worry that Apple and other tech giants may encroach deeper into their territory, according to the Celent survey. Maureen Burns, a partner in Bain's financial-services practice, says \"the worst-case scenario\" for banks is that they're reduced to playing the role of a utility, in which \"they have the risk and regulatory burden but don't get to participate in the best parts of the profit pool.\"\n\nApple has never disclosed the fees it charges banks to process Apple Pay transactions, but analysts figure it collects half a cent on in-store debit card purchases and 15 basis points on credit cards in the U.S. The service generated just $15 million in gross revenue for Apple in the first year of operation, according to Richard Crone, chief executive officer of Crone Consulting, a firm that specializes in mobile payments. Crone figures that could top $1 billion annually in five years if ad revenue is factored in.\n\nIn October, Capital One became the first U.S. institution to introduce its own wallet app that works in stores. \"The irony is, when we first launched payments, people began to ask us, 'Why would we use a bank for payments vs. digital company XYZ?'\u2009\" says Tom Poole, managing vice president for digital payments. He says the wallet has been \"a success\" but won't say how many customers are using it. \"Banks were asleep at the wheel and didn't offer customers alternatives,\" he adds. JPMorgan Chase will unveil its own mobile wallet in mid-2016. As the largest retail bank in the U.S., it could rack up as many users in the first year as Apple Pay did in two, Crone says.\n\nSome banks are lining up behind a product completely different from a wallet. On Feb. 4, Visa announced software being tested by undisclosed clients that feeds card data to all apps on a consumer's device and directs consumers to the issuer bank in case of a problem. \"This puts the banks more firmly into their roles as the trusted third party in payments,\" says Jim McCarthy, an executive vice president at Visa. \"People won't think about whether it's Apple or Samsung or Google. Over time it will become the card again.\"\n\nThat may be wishful thinking. \"Being able to provide a fully branded experience in the digital world will probably be unrealistic,\" says Celent's Bareisis. \"The world will be more fragmented.\" Wells Fargo is embracing that notion: Beginning in the second quarter, account holders will be able to use Android Pay, as well as plastic, to withdraw money at thousands of its ATMs. \"The convenience means that customers are going to get value out of the fact that they have a card with Wells Fargo,\" says Brett Pitts, head of digital at the bank.\n\nThe bottom line: Banks are playing catch-up to Apple Pay's digital wallet, which could have 25 million active users in the U.S. by yearend.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone.

On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself.

The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate - an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries - have surged 47 per cent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

Pilbara Minerals, with a market value of $286 million, is accelerating development of its Pilgangoora project in Western Australia and forecasts production from about 2018. The company has advanced about 1200 per cent since it acquired the site in July 2014.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have grabbed the limelight.\n\nGreenbushes, the world's largest spodumene mine, is also located in Western Australia and owned by the Talison joint venture between China's Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group and Albemarle Corp, the world's biggest lithium producer.\n\nLithium carbonate's price gains will extend to 2017 on weak supply, while demand is likely to soar 64 per cent by 2020 from 2015 levels, Citigroup forecasts. This rising demand is intensifying a race to deliver new sources of lithium raw materials, spurring gains for developers poised to enter production before the end of the decade.\n\nTesla's CEO Elon Musk has plans for a giant battery plant. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nChina is targeting the goal of five million electric vehicles on its roads by 2020, under President Xi Jinping's strategic initiative to upgrade the nation's auto industry. Nissan and Renault SA said this month that sales of battery- powered vehicles rose to a record last year, while Volkswagen's Audi plans to start building its first purely electric sport utility vehicle in 2018.\n\n\"The demand in vehicles, electric bikes, trucks and buses is going to be enormous, and the electric storage market is also going to be significant,\" said Neil Biddle, executive director of Perth-based Pilbara Minerals, which holds the world's second- biggest deposit of spodumene. Prices of spodumene have jumped to about $US480 a tonne this year from around $US380 a tonne in 2014, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nLithium products used in batteries come from three sources: hard rock mining of mineral ores including spodumene; battery recycling; and the evaporation of brine from salt ponds, the technique that has historically dominated production. While hard rock miners such as General Mining and Pilbara Minerals are higher cost than brine projects, they have lower capital spending needs and are quicker to production, making them the best placed to exploit surging prices, according to Foster Stockbroking.\n\nThe cheapest source of lithium is brine and the biggest reserves are in Chile, where companies such as Albemarle and Sociedad Quimica & Minera de Chile SA harness the sun and the world's driest desert to evaporate brine from ponds. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, plans to develop lithium holdings in Chile's northern desert salt flats. Rio Tinto, the world's second biggest miner, has a lithium-borate project in Serbia.\n\nPrevious booms\n\nJust as in previous booms, when miners responded to increasing demand for materials by providing too much supply, a potential risk in lithium is that growth for new energy vehicles in China is being overestimated, Elsa Wang, senior analyst at consultancy Asian Metal in Beijing, said. If all current lithium projects proceed as planned, they would deliver about 330,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate-equivalent by 2020, creating \"a bit of an oversupplied market,\" according to Citigroup analyst Matthew Schembri.\n\nTesla, the producer of electric vehicles and power storage products led by billionaire Elon Musk, is preparing to open its giant Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada. It will probably require 25,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide a year when it reaches capacity, according to Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral, an industry advisory company. That's equivalent to about 45 per cent of current global supply, he said.\n\nLG Chem last year completed construction of an electric-vehicle battery plant in Nanjing, China, with capacity to supply batteries for 50,000 high-performance electric cars annually.

Under the guise of fighting terrorism, the FBI obtained an order from a federal court compelling Apple Inc. to build a \"master key\" that would unlock user information and data on the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nThe government's request, which Apple opposes, is tantamount to giving the world unfettered access to your smartphone, and it should send shivers down the spine of law-abiding citizens worldwide.\n\nPut simply, the government wants the pass code to your smartphone. In years past, cellphone manufacturers would have been able to provide this, but no longer. In response to overwhelming customer demand for protection and minimum levels of privacy, both Apple and Samsung created new operating systems with additional layers of security that do not give the manufacturer access to this information. As is to be expected, this watershed change was not well received by many law enforcement and government officials, particularly in the FBI, who are now using the San Bernardino tragedy to implement radical and far-reaching changes.\n\nThe stark reality is this: if Apple complies and creates software to circumvent its security features, a proverbial \"back door,\" there is no turning back. As Apple CEO Tim Cook explained by customer letter: \"Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.\"\n\nCook is correct. Not only would the government have the ability to access encrypted and password-protected information, but the software could find its way into to the world-at-large, where it can be exploited by criminals, nation-states and other nefarious third parties. The FBI can offer no guarantee to the contrary, and that is a frightening thought. As Michael Fiske, my co-founder at Vysk Communications, has said many times, \"All of our institutions -- hospitals, banking, financial transactions, even the U.S. military -- all depend on encrypted technology to protect their communications, data and infrastructure. Creating master keys will allow terrorists and criminals another avenue to attack these vital organizations.\"\n\nEncryption, at bottom, is good. But to weaken it even in just one instance is to weaken it in all, and that is unacceptable. We must not let the FBI and politicians who agree with them to capitalize on this tragedy and to deprive us of our privacy in this increasingly digital world. What seems to be an innocuous request today could one day become the basis for widespread abuse, creating a situation in which companies are forced to breach the covenant they hold with customers to protect their information.\n\nIt bears repeating that those who support back doors are well-intentioned, as the threat of crime and terrorism is real. But as the debate over encryption grows, it must be remembered that our fundamental rights, including our right to privacy, are not subservient to the desires of law enforcement. Encryption may make life marginally tougher for those who prosecute wrongdoers, but no more so than the right to defense counsel, or the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, or countless other basic protections.\n\nThe benefits of encrypted technology to consumers, to businesses and to private citizens far outweigh the government's need to create access based on isolated incidents. One bad apple shouldn't mean we cut down the entire apple tree.", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on.

One of the friends then called the security man and told him that they had come, he alleged.\n\nOn their way to Shiashie, he recalled overhearing one of the friends talking to someone on the mobile phone but he could not tell whom he was speaking to.\n\nSecurity Man\n\nWhen the security man was alerted about their arrival, he allegedly proceeded to open the gate and when they entered, Asiedu added that he went to the back of the house and brought along a ladder which he placed against the wall.\n\nOne of the friends, he said, climbed first followed by another and after waiting for some time, he followed them to the top via the ladder and gained access into the bedroom of the late MP through the window.\n\nNow in the bedroom, he said the leader of the gang secured the MP's mobile phones as he (MP) was asleep on his bed and handed them over to him (Daniel Asiedu).\n\nContinuing, he said that he went downstairs using the staircase after receiving the mobile phones.\n\nWhile downstairs, he said he saw the security man place a chair close to the polytank; he said he stood on the chair and climbed the polytank and jumped over the wall - a procedure he said his colleagues used to flee the scene.\n\nOne of his friends, he said, gave him a catapult which he was holding for a while as his accomplice held a knife.\n\nDaniel said he dropped the catapult in the house afterwards, explaining that he did not use it at all. Also left in the house were his slippers, adding that it was the knife which his friend used in stabbing the late MP.\n\nKnock Off\n\nThis segment of his first narration appears to have knocked off the general notion that it was he (Daniel) who stabbed JB Danquah to death.\n\nHe is suggesting that it was his friend - the one who gave him the catapult - who stabbed the late MP because as he held on to it, his accomplice had in his possession the knife which he used to stab the late MP.\n\n.\n\nShoes\n\nDaniel said that the amount of GH\u00a22, 000 was paid to him before they set off for the operation, which he described as a 'stealing mission.'\n\nAccording to him, he had never met the man they went to rob, asserting that he used the money paid him to buy some clothing and shoes, having spent the balance on other things.\n\nAlteration\n\nAt this stage of his narration, he made an alteration when he said they did not use the staircase to descend but rather through another room from where they jumped down.\n\nHe said they took their turns to stand on the chair provided by the security man to reach the top of the polytank, from where they scaled a wall and jumped into another house.\n\nHe said that of the three mobile phones belonging to the late MP and which were given to him by the accomplice who did the stabbing, he returned the Samsung but sold two which he claimed had been retrieved.\n\nHe told the police that he knows the houses of both accomplices who, according to him, live at Madina, Accra.\n\nOrigin Of Money\n\nDaniel said when he asked his accomplices about the source of the money they gave him, he was told that it was a certain politician who provided it, adding that he thought the mission was about stealing.\n\nPregnant Wife\n\nDaniel's four months pregnant wife, however, had another story to tell as her narration indicated she told the police that when her husband returned at dawn he had bloodstains on his dress. She is helping with the investigations into the case.

The suspect upon arrest said he was contracted and now he is saying that he actually went there to steal and not to kill. I find it hard to believe all that and so it is important for the police to do their work well and not allow any interference,\" he stated.\n\nProf Attafuah, who reserved comment on the possibility of the suspect speaking under duress, urged the police to be thorough in their investigations and allow the truth to prevail.\n\nIn the view of Prof Attafuah, the narrative surrounding the killing points to a well-planned and executed crime.", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on.

So while it's still probably right around the corner, the phone has so far managed to avoid much of the torrent of leaks that have managed to reveal so much of the Galaxy S7 and LG G5 - we've heard enough about the phone, sure, but pictures of actual hardware have been remarkably hard to come by. A couple weeks back, we did get just that, though, and today the same source is following things up with a new image, this time of the One M10 in white.\n\nThis time, leaker Evan Blass either seems to be coming around to the idea of the phone launching as the One M10, or is resigned to people calling it that anyway, because he's backing down from his tendency to describe the hardware by its Perfume codename and instead suggesting, \"Let's call it HTC One M10 in white.\"\n\nUp top, this is a good match for that last leak, with earpiece, front-facing camera, and a much more visible prox sensor all lining up nicely with what we've already seen. There's no sign of a notification LED, though, but that could just be hiding under the white facade.\n\nDown south, though, things are a different story, and while we're again looking at a physical home button (presumably packing a fingerprint scanner), the button shape is no longer the squat component we saw before, but instead a much more elongated, almost Samsung-looking component. We're not quite sure what to make of the change, but it's clearly different hardware. Could that previous shot be of earlier-stage prototype hardware? We'll need to see even more of the M10 before we get a better sense of just how the phone will be released.\n\nSource: Evan Blass (Twitter)", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on.

We previously heard about the watch earlier this morning, but Samsung appears to have pushed out more information ahead of the annual Mobile World Congress expo, which begins February 22nd in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nThere's no pricing information yet, as Samsung is leaving the specifics up to AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. This new Gear S2 is notable because it's the first device on the market to come equipped with the GSMA's new embedded eSIM specification, meaning the watch can be made to work with any of the above mentioned carriers at any time without having to remove the card inside. The Gear S2 Classic 3G comes with a 1.2-inch circular AMOLED display, a dual-core 1GHz processor, and about two days of battery life, Samsung says. The device runs Tizen and comes with 4GB of storage and 512MB of memory.\n\nNo word on pricing for the Gear S2 Classic 3G\n\nThe Gear S2 isn't the first product with a programmable SIM card. However, the new eSIM specification is backed by some of the industry's biggest names, including device manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Microsoft, and Huawei and telecoms like AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telef\u00f3nica, and EE. \"We don't want the consumer to be disadvantaged compared to the current SIM model,\" GSMA's chief engineer Ian Pannell told The Verge. \"We're putting the first specification out for companies that may want to launch products that are very simple.\" The new eSIM is also 90 percent smaller than a standard SIM card, Pannell noted."]}, "BASF": {"2016-02-17": ["Part 1: Introduction to Erika Karp & Greg Elders\n\nWhy this subject? Why now? Erika Karp, Cornerstone Capital founder and former Wall Street research chief, counts off asset owners, asset managers, investment banks, social media, NGOs, regulators, accountants, exchanges. 'Everything is moving toward more transparency, collaboration and understanding of what sustainability means to the capital markets,' she says.\n\nGreg Elders, senior ESG analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, sympathizes with IROs who think investors don't care, but insists there's growing awareness of how water issues, energy efficiency, employee turnover, safety and other issues are affecting profitability.\n\nElders, whose Twitter handle is @gregoryelders, is part of a team formed by Bloomberg to provide unbiased analysis and context around all of its data. 'No good, no bad, no buy, no sell, but data-driven research, and that's something we've brought to ESG as well,' he sums up.\n\nPart 2: Defining 'corporate sustainability' and examples from around the world\n\nWhen asked how to separate real sustainability from green-washing, Karp says consistency between mission, incentives, accountability and outcomes is the hallmark. 'Consistency is the biggest factor separating the signal from the noise when it comes to corporate excellence,' she says.\n\nKarp provides Cornerstone's definition of corporate excellence, which is its preferred term for corporate sustainability: 'the relentless pursuit of material progress towards a more regenerative and inclusive economy.'\n\nNo company is perfect, Karp notes, but exemplary strivers include Nike, Intel and Goldman Sachs in the US, and BASF and Enel in Europe.\n\nElders, who formerly worked in Europe, acknowledges that less ESG data is reported by US companies compared to Europe, where pension funds, especially in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, have pushed for it.\n\nPart 3: The data challenge\n\nInvestors say they need measurability and predictability around ESG factors. Are they getting it? Elders points out that the usage of ESG data has risen 50 percent per year since Bloomberg launched its ESG product in 2009, with around 20,000 regular users today. Karp points to the importance of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, where she's a founding board member, as well as the GRI and IIRC.\n\nPart 4: Engagement & the 'Shareholder Alignment Frontier'\n\nKarp outlines a framework devised by Cornerstone to look at the issues around ESG and overlay a constructive dialogue. While it takes a broad spectrum of stakeholders into account, the Shareholder Alignment Frontier is constructed around shareholder engagement, so IR is integral. 'There's no dichotomy between optimizing shareholder returns and dealing with societal need,' she adds.\n\nPart 5: Linking diversity\n\nAs a gay woman, investment executive and entrepreneur, Karp explains how diversity and sustainability are linked, because diversity of thought, experience, perspective and style allow for the observation of what's going on in the world and bring energy, creativity and innovation to business and finance: 'Diversity is painful but profitable.'\n\nPart 6: Here come the Millennials\n\nThe World Economic Forum says $51 trillion is being handed to Millennials in the biggest ever inter-generational transfer of wealth. Are they going to change equity investment? 'They won't trade off the idea of giving up competitive economic returns and also having a societal impact. They want both - and they have a right to ask for both,' says Karp, with Elders making a link between the growing popularity of organic products and the values-based investment approach of Millennials.\n\nPart 7: The momentum keeps building\n\nElders and Karp both agree that new guidelines for ERISA pension funds allowing economically targeted investments break down a mental barrier. 'The reality is, speaking as a fiduciary, to not systematically analyze ESG performance in the investment process would be a breach of fiduciary responsibility, not the other way,' Karp adds.", "AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands , Feb. 17, 2016 (Press Release) - AkzoNobel today has made an agreed offer to acquire BASF's Industrial Coatings business for \u20ac475 million.\n\nThe transaction would include technologies, patents and trademarks, as well as securing supply to customers worldwide.

Transfer of heat works on the principle of \"First Law of Thermodynamics\". The law states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed. Transfer of heat continues until the objects involved in the process reach a stage of thermal equilibrium (same temperature). Heat transfer fluid is used to avoid overheating of substances while the process of heat transfer is taking place. During heat transfer, the fluid is circulated through the mechanical parts of the object thereby transferring heat from higher temperature object to the lower temperature object.\n\nGlobal heat transfer fluid market can be bifurcated on the bases of product types including mineral, silicone and aromatics, polyalkylene glycols (homopolymers of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or co-polymers of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide) and glycol fluids. Heat transfer fluids are used for numerous applications in different industries such as oil and gas, concentrating solar power (CSP), pharmaceuticals, chemical and bio-diesel. These liquids are also used to reduce wastage of heat by various processing industries. Mineral oil has the major market share followed by silicone and aromatics. Mineral oil is expected to maintain its dominance where as silicone and aromatic is expected to witness highest growth rate in the coming years.\n\nEurope has the largest market share for heat transfer fluid materials, followed by Asia-Pacific and North America. Europe accounted for more than one-third of global heat transfer fluid market. Spain and Germany are the major markets in Europe. Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness higher growth rate compared to other regions. Europe is expected to remain the market leader owing to growing industrial expansion in the region. Emerging market in China and India is expected to increase the market share of Asia-Pacific in the global heat transfer fluids market in coming future.\n\nIncreasing industrial expansion globally is driving the global heat transfer fluid market. Additionally, increased utilization of heat transfer fluid in the concentrated solar power and other end-user industries is expected to drive the global market. Industrial expansion in the emerging market of Asia-Pacific such as China and India might provide ample opportunity for the manufacturing companies to expand their market in these regions. Also, increasing investment in the chemical industry may further add on to the increasing demand of heat transfer fluid in global market. However, rising raw material price may hamper the growth of heat transfer fluid to some extent.\n\nRequest Brochure of this Report: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/3116\n\nGlobal heat transfer fluid market is dominated by established companies.

This includes modes of action such as Groups 2, 4 and 9.\n\nHowever, Wolf said Groups 1, 6, 10, 14, 22 and 27 need a finer application with greater leaf coating abilities.\n\nHe said broadleaf plants can generally handle a coarser spray.\n\n\"Grasses are not very forgiving. Finer sprays and, for some of you, often higher (water rates), provide that coverage.\"\n\nTank mixes are becoming the norm for many producers who need to defeat traditional pest plants and herbicide tolerant volunteers.\n\nThey have the additional advantage of controlling more than one type of weed and containing more than one mode of action.\n\n\"There are combinations where you are using a 9 and 6 or 9 and 14 tank mix; then the (type of) contact rules,\" he said.\n\n\"If it is a grass and broadleaf, then the grass requirements rule and you need a finer approach.... If you are shorting the water (rates), then you have to make better choices (about that).\"\n\nHe said some producers are looking to reduce refilling times and increase operating speeds by using finer nozzles to ensure basic coverage of leaves with lower water rates.\n\n\"You are creating problems for yourselves and potentially others,\" he said.\n\n\"Group 4, dicamba and 2,4D, and the new Dow products are Group 4, you need to think about coarse to very coarse.\"\n\nFarmers can select the right nozzle using the charts that most nozzle companies provide. Other options include software applications for smartphones and tablets, such as the Saskatchewan Soil Conservations Association's Spray Quality Finder.\n\nWolf said speed is always a variable, but growers can start by choosing the speed at which they would like to travel and then looking for nozzles that produce the spray fineness or coarseness re-quired for the product at the right water rate.\n\nTheir pumps' capacity to provide the appropriate pressure will help determine either the right nozzle or the appropriate speed.\n\nMost charts will provide four or five choices of nozzle openings at a set speed. The smaller the orifice, the higher the pressure.\n\nNozzles are rated for droplet size based on certain pressures. Operating outside of those parameters produces droplets that are inappropriate for the task at hand.\n\n\"These (charts) are amazingly handy,\" Wolf said.\n\nHe advised farmers who find a chart for their nozzles to \"laminate it, download it, put it in the cab.\"\n\nRoundup Ready Xtend soybean friendly chemistry contains dicamba and glyphosate, and BASF's Engenia, which is used for these genetics, requires a coarse to very coarse nozzle to keep it where it is targeted.\n\nDow's new 2,4-D is a choline salt formulation known as Enlist Duo that also requires coarse to very coarse.\n\nXtendimax is the dicamba and glyphosate product that farmers will be able to use this spring because of China's recent approval of the technology. It is also a coarse to very coarse droplet-size product.\n\nMaintaining good patterns and proper coverage with coarse nozzles is a product of pressure.\n\nAs a result, pressure drops when speed is reduced if low water rates are used, which can be a problem, especially when slowing for ditches and other terrestrial hazards.\n\nFlow controls will open, bypassing product to maintain the rate per acre by cutting the pressure, but the controls don't consider the effect on droplets or how far apart these might become.\n\nJason Deveau of Ontario Agriculture said producers should consider mounting inline pressure gauges on their booms to observe what the actual pressures are in their sprayer systems.\n\nA combination of a $15 gauge with a T-fitting can provide accurate nozzle pressure readings. Those pressures are what determines nozzle rates.\n\nSprayers usually measure pressure only from a point near the pump, and the two can be different, especially as sprayers become wider.\n\nWolf said producers not only need to consider efficacy but also future regulations.\n\n\"It is coming, and it matters,\" he said of pending or proposed regulations in Ontario and Manitoba.\n\nFor more information, contact Wolf at Twitter at @nozzle_guy or email at agrimetrix@gmail.com.", "Fluor Corporation (FLR) announced today that BASF awarded Fluor an engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contract for the revamp of an alcohol and plasticizers facility in Pasadena, Texas.

A report by proxy advisory Institutional Investor Advisory Services Shareholders indicates that 32 MNCs in the BSE500 paid royalty aggregating \u20b96,300 crore in FY 2015, amounting to 21 per cent of their pre-royalty pre-tax profits, to their global parent.\n\nOver the past five years, aggregate royalty and related payments for these MNCs increased at a five-year CAGR of approximately 20 per cent compared to an approximate 7 per cent growth in their pre-royalty pre-tax profits.\n\nShareholders must demand a greater say in how much royalties Indian subsidiaries of multinational companies pay to their foreign parents, the report states.\n\nMaruti Suzuki, HUL, ABB, Nestl\u00e9 and Bosch have paid out the maximum amount as royalty in the past three years, according to IiAS's statistics. Aggregate royalty payouts of these five companies was \u20b94,780 crore, or approximately 24 per cent of aggregated pre-royalty pre-tax profits. In fact, Maruti's and ABB's payouts aggregated 30 per cent of their pre-royalty pre-tax profits in FY15, IiAS found.\n\nThe steady increase in royalty payments can be largely attributed to a change in regulations in December 2009, which liberalised the payment of foreign technology collaborations and royalty fees under the automatic route, \"including lump sum payments for transfer of technology, payments for the use of trademark and brand name.\" The unintended consequences of waiving restrictions on royalty payments are reflected in the \"steady increase in technical know-how, royalty, consultancy fees etc. by foreign partners since 2009, without a commensurate increase in either sales or margins,\" the note adds.\n\nThe advisory recommends that performance should be a benchmark for royalty payments, especially when these 32 companies have underperformed their peers in the BSE 200. \"The BSE 200 companies have reported better growth and margins than these 32 MNCs in FY15. This begs the question, what are companies paying for if their local competitors are growing faster and earning better margins?\"\n\nIiAS has also designed a \"Royalty Signal\" that assesses the appropriateness of royalty payout levels in the context of revenues, margins and dividends. Companies are then assigned a score which determines if they are in the red (where they have performed weaker than peers in the BSE 200, or if royalty payouts are higher than dividends), amber (if royalty outpaces the increase in sales and/or profits) and green (if dividends are higher than royalty or if royalty is increasing at a slower pace than sales and profits).\n\nAccording to this ranking, BASF India, Schneider Electric, 3M India, Alstom T&D and Heidelberg Cement were the biggest transgressors. IiAS said that even though companies claim royalty payouts are made on \"arm's length pricing\", companies don't explain how the price has been arrived at or what the impact of R&D by the parent on the subsidiary's products has been.\n\n\"Maruti, for example, has flip-flopped on royalty payouts a number of times in the past few years in order to accommodate Suzuki's demands. For instance, they increased royalty payouts to account for the rupee-yen exchange rate fluctuations: but why did Maruti's board cave into absorbing all the exchange losses?\" it asks.\n\nInvestors and shareholders must engage with companies to understand the terms and conditions based on which royalty is being paid since under current regulations, this does not require shareholder approval. The report concludes by suggesting that this should be brought under the ambit of shareholder approval and until then, \"investors must engage with MNCs in India and actively push them to rationalise royalty payouts.\"\n\nHowever, Riaz Thiangna, Director, Grant Thornton Advisory, believes it would not be right to link IP-related royalty payments to profitability record.", "Formic acid, also known as methanoic acid is a vital intermediate in chemical synthesis, occurring naturally, mostly in ant venom. It belongs to the group of carboxylic acids having a colorless appearance and a highly pungent odor, and is soluble in various alcohols, acetones and ethers. The applications majorly require formic acid in concentrations of 99%, 94%, 90%, and 85%., with 85% being the industry standard acid. A large amount of formic acid is produced as a byproduct in the manufacturing of other chemicals such as acetic acid and hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Formic acid is widely used as a silage and animal feed preservative, antibacterial agent in livestock feed, production of leather, pharmaceutical, rubber chemical, and as a substitute to mineral acids in various cleaning products. It is also used to regulate the pH of various chemical processes.\n\nThe global market for formic acid has been witnessing a noticeable growth on account of growing demand for preservatives and feed additives. Improving living standards internationally has resulted in the growing consumption of meat thereby boosting the demand for formic acid in animal feeds and silage preservatives. Europe accounts for the largest market for formic acid since the banning of antibiotic growth promoters by the European Union in 2006. The market for formic acid in other regions such as Middle East, South America and Central America has also been well-established in tanning and leather applications. In addition, presence of significant textiles and natural rubber industries in Southeast Asia has made the formic acid industry lucrative in the region.\n\nFormic acid is one of the basic organic chemical raw materials widely used in rubbers, pharmaceuticals, dyes, leather and pesticides. The high quality nature of formic acid coupled with the global environmental acceptability is one of the major influencing factors creating an upsurge in the demand in the industry. Moreover, the upcoming safety regulations for the production of formic acid is also anticipated to be one of the key influencing factors for the growth of formic acid with an increased emphasis on different types of products and their respective applications.\n\nIncreasing demand for formic acid in animal feed additives and silage preservatives is expected to be one of major growth factors driving the formic acid market. Moreover, growing textile, leather and rubber industries in emerging economies such as China and India is also anticipated to contribute towards the growing demand for formic acid. Moreover, the ban of antibiotics as a growth promoter in Europe in 2006 has led to an increased demand for formic acid as a substitute. However, fluctuating weather conditions are expected to negatively affect the production of certain application industries such as silage preservative and animal feed additives, which in turn is expected to result in declining demand for formic acid. Focus on research and development activities for the development of innovative products is expected to provide new opportunities for the growth of the market.\n\nRequest Brochure of this Report: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/3366\n\nChongqing Chuandong Chemical (Group) Co.

The system has been enhanced for 2016 with industrial biotech fields and values, special profiles and functionality for investors, Outlook/Gmail integration, and much more. It is the only system with features specific to connecting VCs with industrial biotech companies.\n\nInvestors will find more than promising companies at World Congress. The opportunity to connect with other industrial biotech VCs as well as meet with large companies to collaborate on exits for portfolio companies makes the event a must-go.\n\nCompanies are advised to cater their pitch appropriately during VC partnering meetings. It's important to remember that investors are interested in companies, not projects. As such, a business-focused partnering meeting with an investor is preferable to pitching the science as heavily as is typical in a company presentation. Companies that understand the pros and cons of having VC funding will fare well in investor meetings, as that ground will not need to be covered and will show that the company has done their homework.\n\n\"You can meet everyone from North America in one place at World Congress - it's a great travel and time savings.\" concluded Michael. He's right. The 2015 World Congress hosted 1,400 partnering meetings over its three-day span. Companies participating in partnering came from across the industry, including the biofuels, renewable chemicals, biobased materials, research & development, algae technology development and many other sectors. Besides investors like Sofinnova, Mitsui Global Investment, CAPRICORN Venture Partners, BioEngine Venture Capital and Cycle Capital Management, companies like DSM, Dow Chemical, DuPont, BASF, Cargill and Verdezyne provide a rich business development and in-licensing ecosystem to complement.

There are umpteen solutions to recycle paper, glass, metal, cardboard, etc, but plastics find their way in landfills, oceans, littered on cityscapes.\n\nThe recently concluded World Economic Forum reported 8 million tons of plastic being added to the oceans every year. By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.\n\nOn the other hand, plastic is too much of a versatile material and integrated in our lives. It's utilitarian value remains undisputed. A necessary evil, however, a very small percentage of it is being recycled.\n\nThis is where Amit Tandon and his team step in. An Indian waste to energy startup, his Ventana has developed a disruptive technology that converts waste plastics to drop-in industrial petroleum fuels. By offering a next life solution (as fuel) for end of life waste plastics, the technology enables resource recovery from \"non recyclable\" plastics in the form of useful commodity fuels.\n\n\"Window\" in Spanish, Ventana, for Tandon implies a window to the future, where the \"clean technologies shall disruptively transform energy, transportation, waste recycling, building materials and energy efficiency.\"\n\nAs utopian as it sounds, this is one area that comes with its own set of challenges for, more than a struggle with funding, interface with the government or securing clients, Tandon's biggest challenge was to come up with the perfect prototype to enable effectively and efficiently the process of plastic to oil. \"Just like Edison, we now know a 100 ways of how not to make it,\" laughs Tandon.\n\nComing from a family of entrepreneurs, he knew he had to keep his feet firmly on ground and keep working. As he dabbled with biofuels, small hydel and renenwable energy projects, he also started project development towards plastics to oil in 2006. With partners in the US, it was in 2011 that he incepted the R&D and in 2014, setup India's first continuous demonstration plant for direct conversion of municipal waste plastics to drop-in industrial fuels which are now being used by industries in the plant's vicinity. The technology generates 850-950 litres of fuel from 1 ton of waste plastic and won the India Innovation Award 2013.\n\nEntirely self-funded, Ventana grew purely out of passion and patience. Unlike his father's generation, who fought for loans, faced corruption and bureacracy, Tandon's struggle and frustration was internal.\n\n\"There was no startup buzz, or government action plans, but an entrepreneurial spirit. We have it easier today because of education and awareness, and because we quietly did our work, it was smooth sail on the exterior. Howver, internally, there are so many components to this technology that it took time for the jigsaw puzzle to come together,\" he added.\n\n\"Innovation is a progressive phenomenon, and we've tried to tackle technological constraints common to the first generation of systems,\" said Tandon, ensuring that the \"why\" of \"what\" they were doing remained centre-stage. Many big players such as BASF, Ozmotech (Australia), AlphaKat (Germany) and Agilyx (USA) attempted but had failed.\n\nA Chandigarh-based computer science engineer from Thapar, Patiala , it was when he moved to the United States in 2000 that Tandon gravitated towards clean- tech. What differentiates Tandon's innovation from traditional recycling methods is the inclusion of all kinds of plastics for recycling.\n\nVentana has partnered with Ramky Environment, Asia's leading provider of comprehensive waste-management services, for setting up multiple plastic-to-fuel plants in India. They are also consulting the Government of India on waste to fuel technology, pushing forward the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.", "San Francisco, California -- Feb 18, 2016 / (http://www.myprgenie.com) -- The global market for biosurfactants is expected to reach USD 2,308.8 million by 2020.

There are umpteen solutions to recycle paper, glass, metal, cardboard, etc, but plastics find their way in landfills, oceans, littered on cityscapes.\n\nThe recently concluded World Economic Forum reported 8 million tons of plastic being added to the oceans every year. By 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.\n\nOn the other hand, plastic is too much of a versatile material and integrated in our lives. It's utilitarian value remains undisputed. A necessary evil, however, a very small percentage of it is being recycled.\n\nThis is where Amit Tandon and his team step in. An Indian waste to energy startup, his Ventana has developed a disruptive technology that converts waste plastics to drop-in industrial petroleum fuels. By offering a next life solution (as fuel) for end of life waste plastics, the technology enables resource recovery from \"non recyclable\" plastics in the form of useful commodity fuels.\n\n\"Window\" in Spanish, Ventana, for Tandon implies a window to the future, where the \"clean technologies shall disruptively transform energy, transportation, waste recycling, building materials and energy efficiency.\"\n\nAs utopian as it sounds, this is one area that comes with its own set of challenges for, more than a struggle with funding, interface with the government or securing clients, Tandon's biggest challenge was to come up with the perfect prototype to enable effectively and efficiently the process of plastic to oil. \"Just like Edison, we now know a 100 ways of how not to make it,\" laughs Tandon.\n\nComing from a family of entrepreneurs, he knew he had to keep his feet firmly on ground and keep working. As he dabbled with biofuels, small hydel and renenwable energy projects, he also started project development towards plastics to oil in 2006. With partners in the US, it was in 2011 that he incepted the R&D and in 2014, setup India's first continuous demonstration plant for direct conversion of municipal waste plastics to drop-in industrial fuels which are now being used by industries in the plant's vicinity. The technology generates 850-950 litres of fuel from 1 ton of waste plastic and won the India Innovation Award 2013.\n\nEntirely self-funded, Ventana grew purely out of passion and patience. Unlike his father's generation, who fought for loans, faced corruption and bureacracy, Tandon's struggle and frustration was internal.\n\n\"There was no startup buzz, or government action plans, but an entrepreneurial spirit. We have it easier today because of education and awareness, and because we quietly did our work, it was smooth sail on the exterior. Howver, internally, there are so many components to this technology that it took time for the jigsaw puzzle to come together,\" he added.\n\n\"Innovation is a progressive phenomenon, and we've tried to tackle technological constraints common to the first generation of systems,\" said Tandon, ensuring that the \"why\" of \"what\" they were doing remained centre-stage. Many big players such as BASF, Ozmotech (Australia), AlphaKat (Germany) and Agilyx (USA) attempted but had failed.\n\nA Chandigarh-based computer science engineer from Thapar, Patiala , it was when he moved to the United States in 2000 that Tandon gravitated towards clean- tech. What differentiates Tandon's innovation from traditional recycling methods is the inclusion of all kinds of plastics for recycling.\n\nVentana has partnered with Ramky Environment, Asia's leading provider of comprehensive waste-management services, for setting up multiple plastic-to-fuel plants in India. They are also consulting the Government of India on waste to fuel technology, pushing forward the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan."]}, "Apple": {"2016-02-17": ["NEW YORK (AA) -- Apple is refusing an FBI request to hack an iPhone believed to have information regarding a terror attack in California last December.\n\n\"The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a letter to customers.\n\nThe FBI asked the technology giant to build a new iPhone operating system that would act as a backdoor and would bypass all the security measures of the handset, according to Cook.\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession ... and while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control,\" he said.\n\nThe phone under scrutiny is believed to have belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, the deceased suspect in the San Bernardino shooting that killed 14 victims.\n\nThe head of the FBI told lawmakers last week that the 10-digit-code of the phone in question could not be decrypted.\n\n\"We have no sympathy for terrorists,\" Cook said, adding that the company has complied with all subpoenas and warrants in the case.\n\nBut Cook stressed that the FBI's latest request is \"an overreach\" that has wide-ranging implications.\n\n\"Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data. Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,\" he said.\n\nThe letter released Wednesday earned approval among many tech industry insiders and consumer privacy advocates.\n\nBut the White House on Wednesday lent its support to the FBI's request, saying that the Bureau is not seeking a \"backdoor\" to the iPhone.\n\n\"They're simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device,\" a spokesman told reporters.\n\nEdward Snowden, the contractor who revealed a mass surveillance system executed by the National Security Agency, applauded Cook's strong opposition to the FBI's order.\n\n\"The FBI is creating a world where citizens rely on Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around,\" Snowden tweeted.\n\nActivists are also planning mass rallies at Apple Store locations across the country to show support for the company's stance against encryption backdoors.\n\nEncryption activist organization Fight for the Future is coordinating protests for next week.\n\n\"Governments have been frothing at the mouth hoping for an opportunity to pressure companies like Apple into building backdoors into their products to enable more sweeping surveillance,\" according to Evan Greer, the group's campaign director.\n\n\"It's shameful that they're exploiting the tragedy in San Bernardino to push that agenda. Security experts agree that any weakening or circumvention of security features on a phone puts everyone in danger,\" he added.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would support Apple's legal fight against the court order.\n\nBeyond weakening encryption in the U.S., the ACLU is also worried about international ramifications.\n\n\"The government's request also risks setting a dangerous precedent,\" said staff attorney Alex Abdo. \"If the FBI can force Apple to hack into its customers' devices, then so too can every repressive regime in the rest of the world. Apple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 2016, Newstime Africa.

But doing so might set a dangerous precedent that could threaten the data security of the millions of iPhone users around the world.\n\nThe phone in question was used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a December attack. Investigators don't know if the phone contains important evidence about the attack or the couple's communications -- and because its contents are encrypted, they won't unless they can get the passcode to unlock it. The phone was issued by Farook's employer, the county of San Bernardino.\n\nInvestigators can't just try random passcodes until they hit on the right one, either. The phone has apparently enabled an Apple security feature -- a sort of self-destruct option that would render the phone's data unreadable after 10 incorrect passcode attempts.\n\nThe judge's order requires Apple to create a unique software package -- one Apple CEO Tim Cook described as \"a new version of the iPhone operating system\" -- that would allow investigators to bypass the self-destruct system. The same software would also let the government enter passcodes electronically, eliminating both the tedium of manual entry and the enforced delays the iPhone system imposes after a few wrong guesses.\n\nApple opposes the order, arguing that such software would amount to a security \"backdoor\" that would ultimately make iPhone users across the globe more vulnerable to information or identity theft.

But doing so might set a dangerous precedent that could threaten the data security of the millions of iPhone users around the world.\n\nThe phone in question was used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a December attack. Investigators don't know if the phone contains important evidence about the attack or the couple's communications \u00e2\u0080\" and because its contents are encrypted, they won't unless they can get the passcode to unlock it. The phone was issued by Farook's employer, the county of San Bernardino.\n\nInvestigators can't just try random passcodes until they hit on the right one, either. The phone has apparently enabled an Apple security feature \u00e2\u0080\" a sort of self-destruct option that would render the phone's data unreadable after 10 incorrect passcode attempts.\n\nThe judge's order requires Apple to create a unique software package \u00e2\u0080\" one Apple CEO Tim Cook described as \"a new version of the iPhone operating system\" \u00e2\u0080\" that would allow investigators to bypass the self-destruct system. The same software would also let the government enter passcodes electronically, eliminating both the tedium of manual entry and the enforced delays the iPhone system imposes after a few wrong guesses.\n\nApple opposes the order, arguing that such software would amount to a security \"backdoor\" that would ultimately make iPhone users across the globe more vulnerable to information or identity theft.

In the blue corner is the FBI, which wants Apple to let it access the data on the iPhone of a killer, Syed Rizwan Farook, who gunned down 14 people in California.\n\nIn the red corner is Apple. Its chief executive Tim Cook has cited the need to protect the privacy of its customers and is fighting a court ruling granted to the FBI.\n\nSuperficially it's easy to see how the FBI's defenders might portray this: Farook is dead, but his data might very well help law enforcement officials to prevent more blood from being shed by his friends and contacts. What, then, is the problem with asking Apple to assist with hacking his phone?\n\nIt is this: Apple's stance is as much about protecting the rights the late Farook as it is protecting the rights of everyone else. If Apple is forced to hack the phone for the FBI, what's to stop it from using that privilege again? As Edward Snowden demonstrated, governments aren't terribly trustworthy on this front.\n\nApple's stance isn't entirely altruistic. It has used privacy as a marketing tool. It would like to be seen as the guardian of yours in a Silicon Valley which hasn't always been on the side of the angels in this particular battle because it isn't just state actors who are after your data. There have been numerous controversies involving corporate actors, too.\n\nSo some of this could be viewed through the prism of Apple's corporate interests.\n\nMoreover, some of the iPhone's features have sparked privacy concerns themselves. The \"Hey Siri\" function requires a continually running microphone, for example. You can turn it off, and Apple says that what Siri picks up randomly is automatically written over. Still, there are good reasons that this sort of function has created debate.\n\nThat said, Mr Cook is still on the right side. The FBI has used some very old law in its attempt to force Apple to hack Farook's iPhone by disabling features that wipe data after 10 unsuccessful attempts to input a pin. Now let's say Apple is unsuccessful in the ongoing legal process and goes on to successfully play hacker for the FBI. Another big problem is that it will tell others that it's possible. Hey Siri, where does that leave us?\n\nIt's only two cheers for the employment figures\n\nAre we finally seeing some good news for those with disabilities in the latest set of employment data, which looked cheery all round (apart from when it comes to what people are paid for doing those jobs)?\n\nAs ever, that depends on which figures you choose to look at. Scope, the disability charity, has crunched some of the numbers. So let's look at the good news first, because there hasn't been much of that: for the overall population, 31.4 million people were in work between October and December, the highest number since records began; and the number of disabled people among them increased by 152,000. Hooray! The employment rate for disabled people also increased, by 1.1 per cent. Double hooray!\n\nBut it is at this point that it all starts to collapse, and really quite quickly, because the employment rate for people with disabilities is still pitiful. It is now 46.7 per cent. So a pathetically low number is still a pathetically low number. It's just a bit less low now.\n\nThere is more: let's move on to the gap between the employment rate of disabled people and the employment rate among the rest of the population: it is a whopping 33.6 per cent. And it is unchanged on last year.\n\nTrue, it is at least increasing at the same rate as that of the rest of the population. But there is a good reason for that: employers are finding it tough to get hold of the staff they need. In a tight labour market where their choices are restricted, if they have any choice at all, disabled people are bound to find it easier to get jobs. But what if unemployment edges up and the labour market therefore loosens up? That could change rapidly.\n\nRegardless, that gap is still unacceptable at a time when support via the benefits system is being progressively withdrawn.\n\nThe Government says it wants to close it. Having spoken to Justin Tomlinson, the minister for disabled people, I don't doubt his commitment. But are he and his colleagues doing enough? The figures suggest not. They are also a stain on the nation's conscience, and a drag on the economy, given the huge reservoir of skills and experience that is being wasted.\n\nBrexit: the black hole for small businesses\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses says it plans to seek \"practical and impartial evidence\" on the impact on its members of either remaining within or leaving the EU, at the same time as unveiling its shopping list.\n\nTherein lies the problem. We'll have a pretty good idea of what Britain in a reformed EU will look like when the Prime Minister finalises his deal. We will still not have any idea what the UK outside will look like, because so much of that will be up for negotiation.\n\nThose talks might go well, but they might not. In reality no one really knows what the outcome will be, and if they say they do they are being, how shall we say, economic with the actualit\u00e9. The question facing small businesses is whether they like the idea of staying and putting up with some things they don't like, or taking a leap into a black hole.\n\nMore about: Apple Edward Snowden", "A court order demanding that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) help the U.S. government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle.\n\nBut the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathized with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide.\n\nA federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance\" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings.\n\nThe government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put \"backdoors\" in their products.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was \"narrowly tailored,\" and chided Apple. \"It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil.\"\n\nMost technology security experts, including many who have served in government, say technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes.\n\n\"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,\" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\"\n\nRepresentatives of several other tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department.\n\nThe industry was \"committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe\" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, \"the government's position is overbroad and unwise.\"\n\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association said that if the order was carried out, \"it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit.\"\n\nIf the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. \"The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,\" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues.\n\nFarook was assigned the phone by the county health department he worked for, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had \"given its consent\" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said.\n\nSan Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families.\n\n\"They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats? Were there other individuals involved?\" Ramos said in a phone interview.\n\n'MASTER KEY'\n\nDan Guido, an expert in hacking operating systems, said that to unlock the phone, the FBI would need to install an update to Apple's iOS operating system so that investigators could circumvent the security protections, including one that wipes data if an incorrect password is entered too many times.\n\nHe said that only Apple can provide that software because the phones will only install updates that are digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key.\n\n\"That key is one of the most valuable pieces of data the entire company owns,\" he said. \"Someone with that key can change all the data on all the iPhones.\"\n\nThe notion of providing that key is anathema to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group. \"Once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nLance James, an expert in forensics who is chief scientist with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, said Apple could respond to the order without providing crypto keys or specialized tools that could be used to unlock other phones.\n\nApple technicians could create software that would unlock the phone, allowing the company to create a backup file with all of its contents that they could provide to law enforcement, James said.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Alex Abdo said the government's request risked a \"dangerous\" precedent. \"The Constitution does not permit the government to force companies to hack into their customers' devices,\" he said.\n\nApple was a topic of discussion on the presidential campaign trail on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican Party's nomination to run in the Nov. 8 election, appearing on Fox News Channel's \"Fox & Friends,\" said, \"I agree 100 percent with the courts - in that case, we should open it (the iPhone) up. ... We have to use common sense.\"\n\nAnother Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, called it a \"tough issue\" that would require government to work closely with the tech industry to find a solution. Rubio said he hoped Apple would voluntarily comply with the court order. - This article was first published by Reuters", "CUPERTINO -- The home of the world's most valuable company may soon start taxing businesses with more than 100 workers $1,000 per employee.\n\nCupertino Mayor Barry Chang said the idea has been on his mind for months. But when the Santa Clara County Democratic Club unanimously endorsed a proposed new business tax in San Jose, Chang said his city is next.\n\n\"Low-income people work their butts off -- excuse my language -- and they still cannot survive here,\" Chang said Wednesday. \"Traffic is getting worse and worse. Homeless people are freezing to death. As political leaders, we should all feel a little ashamed.\"\n\nChang's proposal, which the City Council is expected to consider next month, is expected to take a much bigger bite out of Cupertino's most famous corporate resident, Apple. The computer giant is expected to expand its workforce in the suburban city from 16,000 to 23,400 workers with the opening of a second campus.\n\nSome of Chang's council colleagues signaled they'd like big employers' buy-in before charging ahead. Councilman Darcy Paul said he wants to see Apple and the region's other major companies \"voluntarily and actively involved\" in discussions about the new business tax.\n\n\"I believe that they would support a well-considered solution,\" Paul said.\n\nChang's is the latest of several tax proposals being floated this year. San Jose officials are weighing a city sales tax for the June ballot. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority is considering a November sales tax measure earmarked for various transportation projects, which would require two-thirds voter approval. And a San Jose State professor is gathering signatures for a November measure to raise taxes on large San Jose businesses, which would pay based on gross receipts or payroll for corporate headquarters.\n\nChang says general sales tax increases are \"regressive\" because they hit low-income residents hardest.\n\nWhile San Jose's business and sales tax proposals aim to raise revenue for various needs including police and fire protection and road maintenance, Chang said Cupertino's chief need is traffic relief. Apple's new \"spaceship\" campus in the city has drawn grumbling from residents about exacerbating existing traffic problems.\n\nChang, a Democrat running for state Assembly in District 24, admitted that Cupertino giving Apple the green light to expand its headquarters contributed to the traffic congestion. Now he believes Apple and other big companies should step up and pay more taxes to fix the problem.\n\n\"Apple is making so much money,\" Chang said. \"I know they'll fight me on this, but I'm not worried about it. This is the right thing to do. They can't always just think about profits and not care about the community.\"\n\nChang, who will be termed out in 2018, said he spoke with Apple representatives about the plan recently and was met with resistance. Jason Lundgaard, Apple's manager of state and local government affairs, was unavailable for comment Wednesday. Apple spokesman Colin Johnson declined to comment because \"details about the proposal are not available yet.\"\n\nChang says the revenue from the proposed tax would be used to build a mass light-rail transit system to get Cupertino residents and employees off the roads to reduce traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. He came up with the $1,000-per-employee figure based on the costs of each person riding public transit every working day of the year. If each employee pays $4 a day for 260 working days, he estimated, that comes out to about $1,000 a year.\n\nCupertino currently charges businesses a flat fee of $133 per year then a varying amount based on square footage for commercial businesses within city limits. Those amounts are adjusted annually due to inflation. The new tax would be in addition to the existing business tax.\n\nBy comparison, San Jose charges businesses $150 annually, plus $18 per employee per year for those with more than eight employees, but that amount is capped at $25,000 a year.\n\nChang says the proposal can be approved by a majority City Council vote and doesn't require voter approval.\n\nCouncilman Rod Sinks said he supports Chang's idea if it means resolving the city's growing traffic problem.\n\n\"I certainly support the concept of a tax on businesses to help us pay for transit,\" Sinks said. \"You can't convince people to get out of their cars unless you have an alternative that's faster.\"", "Google CEO Sundar Pichai has chimed in on the escalating battle between the FBI and Apple over iPhone encryption.

CEO Tim Cook says his company will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino, California shooters. The company said that could potentially undermine encryption for millions of other users.\n\nCook's response, posted early Wednesday on the company's website, set the stage for a legal fight between the federal government and Silicon Valley with broad implications for digital privacy and national security.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym had ordered Apple to help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the shooters in the Dec. 2 attack that killed 14 people. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, died in a gun battle with police.\n\nThe ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply software the FBI can load onto Farook's county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nThe Obama administration has embraced stronger encryption as a way to keep consumers safe on the Internet but has struggled to find a compelling example to make its case.\n\nCook called the ruling an example of government overreach and said \"this moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.\" He argued that the order \"has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\" He said it could undermine encryption by using specialized software to create an essential back door akin to a \"master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.\"\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,\" Cook wrote. \"The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a back door. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors told Pym that they can't access Farook's work phone because they don't know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated. Under U.S. law, a work phone is generally the property of a person's employer. The magistrate judge told Apple in Tuesday's proceeding to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order, suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work.\n\nApple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. Previously, the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government.\n\nThe magistrate's order requires that the software Apple provides be programmed to work only on Farook's phone, and said Apple has five days to notify the court if it believes the ruling is unreasonably burdensome.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what investigators believe they might find on Farook's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers, such as Google or Facebook, though investigators think the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled.\n\nThe phone was running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system. It was configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup.\n\nFarook and Malik took pains to physically destroy two personally owned cell phones, crushing them beyond the FBI's ability to recover information from them. They also removed a hard drive from their computer; it has not been found despite investigators diving for days for potential electronic evidence in a nearby lake.\n\nFarook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack. It was discovered after a subsequent search.\n\nThe judge didn't spell out her rationale in her three-page order, but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n\nInvestigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik's timeline from that day. Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group; Malik's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group's leader around the time of the attack.", "Apple had a gang of new products in 2015, but what will 2016 bring?

The game starring the Kardashian half-sisters is a spin-off of the popular \"Kim Kardashian: Hollywood\" game released in 2014.\n\n\"There does seem to be a unique affinity for fans of the Kardashian-Jenners to like narrative role-playing games,\" said Glu President and CEO Niccolo de Masi during an interview at the D.I.C.E. Summit.\n\nWhile the Jenner sisters' game maintains the same cartoony aesthetic of the Kardashian game, the fashion-focused \"Kendall & Kylie\" is intended to be played in portrait mode on smartphones and tablets instead of landscape mode like \"Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.\"\n\nThe games are currently rewarding gamers who play both titles in a special \"krossover\" event. De Masi is optimistic that \"Kendall & Kylie\" will achieve similar success as \"Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,\" which reportedly earned $200 million last year.\n\n\"I think it could do anywhere from half or double to what Kim achieved,\" said de Masi, who presented a talk Wednesday morning about celebrity social media followers at the Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's 15th annual D.I.C.E. Summit.\n\nDespite the Kardashians' mobile triumph, Katy Perry didn't similarly blast off last year with her Glu game, \"Katy Perry Pop.\" It failed to crack the Top 100 apps on Apple's charts. De Masi said Perry's game wasn't as fruitful because it was marred with technical glitches and didn't feature enough of Perry's music.\n\n\"We're talking to her team about how we could evolve this game but also how we could reboot it,\" de Masi said.\n\nSan Francisco-based Glu is currently working on titles starring Nicki Minaj, Gordon Ramsay, Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. De Masi said his team is looking at ways to differentiate all those celebrity games from each other.\n\n\"They're very different,\" de Masi said. \"I can't say what the mechanic will be because that's a trade secret. We're pushing very hard to differentiate the game experiences.

Chief executive Tim Cook called it \"an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,\" and said the order \"has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\"\n\nApple, Google and other technology firms in recent years have stepped up encryption - allowing only the customers to have \"keys\" to unlock their devices - claiming improved security and privacy is needed to maintain confidence in the digital world.\n\nThat drive for privacy has prompted sharp objections from law enforcement and intelligence officials, who claim that criminals and extremists are able to hide their illicit activities thanks to device encryption.\n\n\"This is a clever move by the FBI to move from the legislative arena, where they were not winning, to the courts,\" said Joseph Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a digital rights group.\n\nRAISING PRIVACY HACKLES\n\nThe order raised hackles among privacy advocates, which see the potential to unleash unbridled surveillance in the United States and elsewhere. \"If the FBI can force Apple to hack into its customers' devices, then so too can every repressive regime in the rest of the world,\" said Alex Abdo of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nBut Apple also came under attack for thwarting a critical security investigation. \"Apple chose to protect a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people,\" said Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\n\"Regrettably, the position Tim Cook and Apple have taken shows that they are unwilling to compromise and that legislation is likely the only way to resolve this issue.\"\n\nNew York City police commissioner William Bratton welcomed the order and added, \"We cannot give those seeking to harm us additional tools to keep their activity secret. I reiterate my call on Congress to act immediately in passing legislation to provide law enforcement the tools we need to keep America safe.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman John Earnest said the White House supports the request by the FBI and Department of Justice. \"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters. They're simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\"\n\nDEBATE ON 1789 LAW\n\nThe case is likely to work its way through the courts, which will need to consider a number of both technical and legal questions.\n\nInterestingly, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym's order is based on the 1789 All Writs Act, which lays out broad authority for the courts to help enforcement of the law.\n\nSteve Vladeck, an American University law professor and co-editor of the Just Security blog, said the order stretches the interpretation of the centuries-old law.\n\n\"If the government can compel Apple to develop software (to get around encryption) what can't it do,\" Vladeck told AFP. \"There is no history of court orders compelling companies to do research and design.\"\n\nLegal scholar Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University said in a blog post that Pym \"seems to believe that she can order companies to become unwilling participants in surveillance research and development.\" \"I fail to see her legal basis for such an extraordinary order against a private company,\" Turley wrote.\n\nBerin Szoka, president of the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, said the order goes against \"bedrock principles of law and privacy.\"\n\n\"If forcing Apple to hack its own devices qualifies as 'reasonable technical assistance,' there is no practical limit to what law enforcement could force private companies to do to compromise the security of their systems,\" Szoka said in a statement.\n\nDarren Hayes, a Pace University professor of computer forensics, argued that Apple and other tech companies may have gone too far by using encryption that, in theory, makes it impossible for the firms to hand over evidence even if served with a legal warrant.\n\n\"I think that the public, once they become more educated about what is happening, might change their stance about Apple,\" said Hayes, who has worked as a consultant to law enforcement. \"This case is sensitive for the US public and I don't think it's particularly good public relations for Apple\" to refuse to help the investigation, Hayes added.\n\nOne key question is whether Apple has the ability to provide the assistance sought by the FBI. \"Apple does not have the keys to your device - they are burned onto your chip,\" Hall said.\n\nBut he said it may be possible to get around that encryption with software modifications. \"Apple has never been forthcoming about the deep details of its system,\" Hall said.\n\nHayes said that no one knows for sure if Apple can circumvent the encryption, but noted \"the fact that they're arguing this makes me think they may be able to do it.\"", "Founded in 2010, Google Ideas has been led by Washington, D.C.-insider-turned-Googler Jared Cohen, who will continue to lead Jigsaw as president. Cohen began working at the U.S. Department of State under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and continued on when Hillary Clinton assumed that role after Barack Obama was elected president. Cohen joined Google when Ideas was launched.\n\nWe contacted Google to learn more about the new mission for Jigsaw but were told by a spokesperson that the company was not commenting beyond Schmidt's Medium post. However, she added, \"the mission will not significantly change.\"\n\nA 'Complex Puzzle of Challenges'\n\n\"As a technology incubator, Jigsaw will be investing in and building technology to expand access to information for the world's most vulnerable populations and to defend against the world's most challenging security threats,\" Schmidt noted in his post. He added that the name was chosen because it \"acknowledges that the world is a complex puzzle of physical and digital challenges.\" The name also \"reflects our belief that collaborative problem-solving yields the best solutions,\" Schmidt said.\n\nJigsaw will continue to pursue ongoing Google Ideas' projects such as Project Shield, which allows Webmasters to thwart distributed denial of service attacks by serving their sites through Google's infrastructure; the Investigative Dashboard document search tool for journalists; and the Digital Attack Map, which displays data-based threats on a global map in real-time.\n\nOther issues that the Ideas/Jigsaw research will continue to focus on include the global arms trade, money laundering, police brutality, terrorism, and online hate and harassment, Schmidt said.\n\nSnowden: Google 'Picked a Side'\n\nWikiLeaks, the news leak organization founded by Julian Assange in 2006, today welcomed the news about Google Ideas' rebranding with the following tweet: \"Google's 'regime change' dept 'Ideas' is now 'Jigsaw' (better known as the hitech serial killer in Saw).\" The tweet also provided a link to an online excerpt from Assange's 2014 book, \"When Google Met WikiLeaks.\"\n\nIn that book, Assange recounted his 2011 meeting with Google's Schmidt while Assange was under house arrest in the U.K. but before he took asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remains today.\n\nAssange and WikiLeaks have both criticized Google for providing data about WikiLeaks to U.S. government authorities investigating the organization's publication of leaked government data.\n\nWikiLeaks today also retweeted a comment made by former National Security Agency contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden. Snowden sent out a tweet after Apple's latest vow to fight a federal court order to unlock an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the two assailants in the recent San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack. The tweet is as follows: \"This is the most important tech case in a decade. Silence means @google picked a side, but it's not the public's.\"\n\nOn December 2, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot at people gathered at an event for the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health. The couple killed 14 people and seriously wounded 20 others. Farook and his wife were killed in a shootout with police. Since the attack, authorities have been going through their belongings, including their smartphones, trying to determine their motives and whether they were part of a larger terrorist plot.\n\nIn posting his tweet, Snowden also retweeted a comment by WhiteHat Security founder Jeremiah Grossman that said, \"Today would be the perfect day for Sundar Pichai (Google, CEO) to back up Tim Cook (Apple, CEO).\"", "\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\" There's some uncertainty over whether Edmund Burke actually made this observation. But, regardless of its provenance, the wisdom merits a tweak for our times. Today the necessary condition for vested interests to prevail over the public interest is that good men don't understand what the hell is going on.\n\nSomething has happened in the UK banking reform debate. Sir John Vickers, a central figure in the Government's post-crisis financial overhaul, has questioned whether the Bank of England's latest proposals to shore up the sector go far enough.\n\nYet this debate is perfectly impenetrable to the non-expert. Read the exchanges between Sir John and the Bank and you will soon slip into a numbing bath of acronyms and jargon from which you will very likely not resurface any the wiser.\n\nG-SIBs, D-SIBs, SRBs, RWAs, Tier 1, Basel III, CoCos ... These names will float across your vision, like the members of the world's most boring rap group. You will read about the appropriate threshold for the activation of \"a risk-weighted SRB rate of 3 per cent\" and the relevance of \"counter-cyclical buffers\" and, you will, quite understandably, conclude there is something better you could be doing with your time.\n\nBut ignore the detail. This complexity is the outcome of years, perhaps even decades, of horse trading between bank lobbyists, regulators and politicians from all around the world. As a non-expert you're not supposed to be able to follow it. It hasn't been designed to confuse ordinary people. That's just a happy side-effect (as far as the banks are concerned).\n\nSo clear it from your mind. Focus, instead, on the essentials. Banks are not as complex as they are made out to be by bankers and regulators. A bank has a balance sheet just like any other business. On the asset side of the balance sheet are its loans to customers. On the liabilities side are the current account deposits of customers, plus borrowings from the wholesale capital markets and, most importantly of all, the equity of its investors. The liabilities of a bank fund its assets.\n\nEquity is what gets eaten into first when a bank makes losses. If the equity is all used up, the bank is bust. And as we saw in 2008, that can mean taxpayers forced to step in to stop these institutions collapsing and taking the entire economy down with them. That's why regulators must make sure banks have a sufficiently large tranche of equity financing on their balance sheets.\n\nThe Independent Banking Commission, which Sir John chaired, said in 2011 that UK banks should be forced to fund themselves with a certain amount of equity in order to make sure they would not need to call on taxpayers again. It recommended more equity than these institutions typically had going into the financial crisis.\n\nBut the Bank of England seems to be planning to let banks fund themselves with less equity than Sir John recommended. So he has raised his voice in protest. The Bank of England does not agree that it is softening its requirements. In a reply to Sir John, two deputy governors, Sir Jon Cunliffe and Andrew Bailey, have claimed the Bank is respecting the original plan and, in fact, going further.\n\nPart of the debate seems to hinge on whether one should count a type of special bank debt that automatically converts to equity in a crisis as a part of a bank's official equity or not. There's a strong case for not doing this, since these financial instruments are clearly untested.\n\nBusiness picture of the day 42 show all Business picture of the day 1/42 Stormy skies for Disney's Hong Kong theme park\n\nWalt Disney's Hong Kong theme park posted its first net loss in four years in 2015, as Chinese visitors numbers slumped, a potential headache for the US firm as it prepares to open its first mainland Chinese park in June.

The differences between the Bank of England and the commission's proposals are not, in truth, immense. This is more an issue of principle. Sir John believes he and his commission erred on the conservative side in those 2011 equity demands, on the grounds that to push for more might have been economically disruptive. And he sees no good reason why they should be rolled back even an inch by the Bank.\n\nIn support of his case Sir John has chosen to cite the analysis of the respected independent expert in finance, Anat Admati of Stanford University. This is interesting. Ms Admati has recommended that a private bank's equity cushion should be equivalent to between 20 to 30 per cent of its assets.\n\nSo what would you guess is the current level of equity for banks being targeted by the Bank of England? Fifteen per cent? Ten per cent? Try 3 per cent. Or 4 per cent at most. And even Sir John's report, despite his complaints today, only wanted banks to hold equity worth a maximum of around 4 per cent of assets. Consider what this means: it implies that a mere 3 or 4 per cent fall in the value of a bank's assets would bankrupt it - and government ministers and regulators would, once again, need to consider whether to step in. To state what should be obvious: that's not very much. And that simple ratio - known as the \"leverage ratio\" - should be focus of debate.\n\nInstead, the discussion gets side-tracked. The commercial banks complain that Sir John is pushing for something that will crush the global competitiveness of the City of London -- when the reality is low equity buffers juice up their profits. The Bank of England, meanwhile, claims much has changed in the regulatory sphere since Sir John delivered his 2011 report. And we get showered in those acronyms.\n\nBut the central fact is that even Sir John's slightly tougher equity proposals are insufficient truly to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. This battle is over small movements around an equity benchmark that has been set far too low. This row doesn't signify nothing, but it certainly doesn't signify enough.\n\nBritish banks have an aggregate balance sheet several times the size of the entire economy. As 2008 showed, failures by large banks represent the pre-eminent economic threat to all our livelihoods. If people grasped what was at stake and how little had been done on equity, the clamour for action would be deafening. But the ordinary citizen, whose money is on the line, is blinded by jargon. And the vested interests prevail.\n\nMore about: Bank Of England Sir John Vickers Independent Banking Commission", "Law enforcement officials say current technologies can make their jobs much more difficult.\n\nApple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook's stand against having his company help unlock encrypted data on the San Bernardino shooters' cellphone is part of a larger battle between the federal government and Silicon Valley.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym directed Apple on Tuesday to help the FBI get around the phone's pass code protection and any auto-erase functions the device might employ.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Cook said that such a move would undermine encryption by creating a backdoor that could potentially be used in the future on devices.\n\nHere is a breakdown:\n\nQ: How big a problem is encrypted technology?\n\nA: In general, prosecutors and intelligence officials say current technologies can make it impossible to examine suspects' communications even if police have a court order.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note that some tech companies have boasted to customers that when their technologies are used, nobody can gain access to their messages ever, including the government.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in a report issued in November that it was unable to execute 111 search warrants for smartphones over the last year because they were running on encrypted technology offered through Apple's iOS 8 operating system.\n\nSeveral cellphone models, including Apple's iPhone 6 and Samsung's Galaxy S6, use advanced encryption algorithms that scramble all the data on the device when a pin code is set.\n\nEncrypted cellphones and text-messaging apps have made it harder for investigators and intelligence services to track suspected plots in real time, or trace locations and connections once they acquire a suspect's device, the FBI has said.\n\nApple changed the way it manages phone encryption in September 2014, a move that makes it more difficult for law enforcement to access encrypted data on cellphones, according to Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California's Center for Computer System Security. Previously, forensic investigators could tap into a device's hardware port and gain access to a phone's data \"independent of needing to try pass codes,\" he said.\n\n\"That path into the device is no longer possible,\" Neuman said.\n\nThe change in the encryption method means Apple may not be able to decrypt the data, according to Neuman. The company could, however, bypass the access code system that would cause the data to be erased, and then grant the FBI access to the encrypted data. Federal investigators would then have to decrypt the data themselves, Neuman said.\n\nQ: Is the federal government pressuring Silicon Valley?\n\nA: In the wake of San Bernardino, President Obama addressed the nation in urging high-tech and law enforcement leaders \"to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.\"\n\nAlthough the tech industry says it wants to help, it's reluctant to give away private information and data to government agencies.\n\nQ: What has the government been trying to do?\n\nA: In January, federal officials announced the creation of a task force to help prevent extremist groups from using social media to radicalize and mobilize recruits. The interagency group will be led by the Homeland Security and Justice departments, but will include staff from the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center and other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, the State Department will establish a unit called the Global Engagement Center to work with allies to deter terrorists from carrying out attacks overseas.\n\nQ: Why goes the government want to unlock the phone?\n\nA: Authorities are trying to determine the couple's movements between the time of the attack at the Inland Regional Center the morning of Dec. 2 and their deaths in a wild firefight with police hours later. Last month, the FBI asked for the public's help in filling in an 18-minute gap in the narrative of the couple's whereabouts.\n\nThe FBI is also probing whether the couple received any help in the attacks.\n\nQ: How did this get to court?\n\nA: The device, an iPhone5, was given to Syed Rizwan Farook by the San Bernardino County Health Department and was used in his job as an inspector, according to the motion.\n\nIt is the tech giant's policy to require law enforcement to obtain search warrants or subpoenas before aiding in investigations. But the company sees the order as an \"overreach by the U.S. government,\" according to the statement.\n\nQ: Does this battle go beyond cellphones?\n\nA: Yes, terrorism spreading through social media has also been a major issue.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, has led a push in Congress for legislation that would require social media companies to root out and report suspicious activity. Tech firms and privacy advocates beat back an effort by Feinstein earlier last year.\n\nLOS ANGELES TIMES", "WASHINGTON - An extraordinary legal fight is brewing with major privacy implications for millions of cellphone users after a federal magistrate ordered Apple Inc. to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the gunman in the San Bernardino mass shootings.\n\nThe clash brings to a head a long-simmering debate between technology companies insistent on protecting digital privacy and law enforcement agencies concerned about losing their ability to recover evidence or eavesdrop on the communications of terrorists or criminals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House quickly disputed the contention by Apple's chief executive officer, Tim Cook, that the Obama administration is seeking to force the software company to build a \"backdoor\" to bypass digital locks protecting consumer information on Apple's popular iPhones.\n\nThe early arguments set the stage for what will likely be a protracted policy and public relations fight in the courts, on Capitol Hill, on the Internet and elsewhere.\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \"They're simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\"\n\nWithin hours of the judge's order on Tuesday telling Apple to aid the FBI with special software in the case, Cook promised a court challenge. He said the software the FBI would need to unlock the gunman's work-issued iPhone 5C would be \"too dangerous to create\" and \"undeniably\" a backdoor.\n\nCook compared it to a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks, and said there was no way to keep the technique secret once it was developed.\n\n\"Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\" Cook said.\n\nAt the center of the debate is the private information carried on nearly 900 million iPhones sold worldwide: Photographs, videos, chat messages, health records and more.\n\nThere also was swift reaction on the presidential campaign trail, where Donald Trump told Fox News that he agreed \"100 percent with the courts,\" and on Capitol Hill, where the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, R-N.C., said, \"Court orders are not optional and Apple should comply.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who fought encryption in the 1990s, said she thought the government should be able to access the phone. On Twitter, Edward Snowden called it \"the most important tech case in a decade.\"\n\nBut Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., called the Justice Department's request \"unconscionable and unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym represents a significant victory for the Justice Department, which last year decided not to pursue a legislative fix to address encryption but has now scored a win instead in the courts.\n\nFederal officials until now have struggled to identify a high-profile case to make its concerns resonate. But in siding with the government, Pym, a former federal prosecutor, was persuaded that agents investigating the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11 had been hobbled by their inability to unlock the county-owned phone used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December before dying in a police shootout.\n\nThe dispute places Apple, one of the world's most respected companies, on the side of protecting the digital privacy of an accused Islamic terrorist.\n\n\"We have no sympathy for terrorists,\" Cook said.\n\nApple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. The phone Farook was using, running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, was configured to erase data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful unlocking attempts.\n\nThe magistrate ordered Apple to create special software the FBI could load onto the phone to bypass the self-destruct feature. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nThe Justice Department said it was asking Apple to help unlock only the iPhone used by Farook and owned by the county government where he worked as an environmental inspector. The judge said the software should include a \"unique identifier\" so that it can't be used to unlock other iPhones.\n\n\"If a court can legally compel Apple to do that, then it likely could legally compel any other software provider to do the same thing,\" including helping the government install tracking or eavesdropping software on a phone or laptop, said Kevin Bankston, director of the Open Technology Institute at New America.\n\nIt was unclear how readily the software might be modified to work against other iPhones, or how quickly Apple might update its own software to render the new bypass ineffective.\n\nThe next step in the case wasn't immediately clear, either. The judge gave Apple five days to contest the order as unreasonably burdensome. A magistrate judge on the lowest rung of the federal judiciary almost certainly could not establish meaningful precedent without affirmation from a higher-court judge, which means the fight is likely to proceed up the chain.\n\nThe former head of the FBI division responsible for producing some of the FBI's most cunning surveillance tools, Marcus Thomas, said Apple faces a challenge in showing that the government's request is overly burdensome. Thomas, the chief technology officer at Subsentio LLC, said companies that build ultra-secure products that might be used by criminals or terrorists can expect government requests for help.\n\n\"Society wants to know that companies aren't producing these complicated services and devices that can be used as weapons against them,\" he said.", "(Reuters) - A court order demanding that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) help the U.S. government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle.\n\nBut the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathized with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide.\n\nA federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance\" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings.\n\nThe government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put \"backdoors\" in their products.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was \"narrowly tailored,\" and chided Apple. \"It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil.\"\n\nMost technology security experts, including many who have served in government, say technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes.\n\n\"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,\" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\"\n\nRepresentatives of several other tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department.\n\nThe industry was \"committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe\" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, \"the government's position is overbroad and unwise.\"\n\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association said that if the order was carried out, \"it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit.\"\n\nIf the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. \"The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,\" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues.\n\nFarook was assigned the phone by the county health department he worked for, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had \"given its consent\" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said.\n\nSan Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families.\n\n\"They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats?

We have to use common sense.\"\n\nAnother Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, called it a \"tough issue\" that would require government to work closely with the tech industry to find a solution.

The company has published the Quicken personal finance app since the early days of the Mac, and it has received preferred treatment from Apple on a number of occasions, aiding its success. (Apple subsidiary Claris bundled Quicken with ClarisWorks in 1992 and Apple itself bundled Quicken with Performa models in the mid-1990s.)\n\nAnd yet, Intuit has jerked Mac users around repeatedly. Back in 1998, the company announced it was dropping Quicken entirely (\"Intuit Drops Quicken for Macintosh,\" 20 April 1998), before reversing the decision weeks later after pressure from Apple (\"Quicken Speeds Back to Mac,\" 11 May 1998). Quicken 2002 Deluxe made the transition to Mac OS X successfully, although subsequent versions required the Rosetta emulator to run on Intel-based Macs. That was fine for Quicken 2005, 2006, and 2007, but then development paused, with Intuit announcing that the planned Quicken Financial Life would be delayed from 2008 to 2010 (\"Quicken For Mac Delayed Until 2010,\" 10 July 2009). It never shipped, and Quicken 2007 was eventually replaced in 2011 by the weaker Quicken Essentials. Quicken 2007's reliance on Rosetta meant that it wasn't compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, forcing many users to put off that upgrade (\"Intuit Reminds Quicken Users of Lion Danger,\" 6 July 2011). But in 2012, Inuit released a version of Quicken 2007 that could run in Lion and later versions of OS X (\"Intuit Releases Quicken Mac 2007 OS X Lion Compatible,\" 8 March 2012). Eventually, Intuit moved beyond Quicken Essentials to release Quicken 2015, though it too didn't match up to Quicken 2007 (\"Quicken 2015: Close, But Not Yet Acceptable,\" 2 October 2014). And finally, Intuit said last year that it was looking for a company to acquire Quicken (\"Intuit to Sell off Quicken,\" 24 August 2015).

It also pulled in an additional 2.1 million customers in the quarter, bringing its total customer base to 63 million.\n\nThe results continue the company's run of good results: it has added over a million customers every quarter for the past ten quarters, and for the past three quarters added two million customers.\n\nT-Mobile US has aggressively chased customers from rival companies by removing the aspects of their current contracts that most frustrate them.\n\nIt does not tie customers into contracts, as opposed to the standard two-year contracts that market leaders AT&T and Verizon insist on. And T-Mobile US has even offered to pay the exorbitant fees that those companies charge to let people out of their contracts.\n\nT-Mobile US offers a more flexible text message and data approach that can save customers hundreds of dollars a year with the same usage. It has allowed customers to roll over unused data to the next month. And recently it has offered two services - one for music and one for video - that allow customers to access streaming services without them impacting data usage.\n\nCEO John Legere was also keen to point out that the company is retaining those pulled-over customers. \"We aren't just winning customers, we're keeping them too,\" he said on the earnings call. He also highlighted that most of the customers are coming from market leader AT&T.\n\nOn the downside, T-Mobile US's new video service - BingeOn - has become controversial due to its likely breaking of net neutrality rules; something that sparked a series of poorly judged responses from Legere that slightly tarnished his loveable maverick reputation.\n\nThat aside, T-Mobile US's message of putting customers first, as opposed to trying to extract maximum profit from each and every one, continues to resonate. The image of a fast and fun company that Legere has been pushing was even extended to a T-Mobile-created drinking game for its own results.\n\n\"Take a drink every time: anyone references 'listening to customers' (you know because we say it A LOT); John Legere drops a four letter expletive,\" reads part of guide. \"Finish your drink if: there's a suit or tie sighting.\"\n\nSuccess aside, Wall Street is still tying T-Mobile US share price to the company's total revenue, rather than its growth success.

But doing so might set a dangerous precedent that could threaten the data security of the millions of iPhone users around the world.\n\nThe phone in question was used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a December attack. Investigators don't know if the phone contains important evidence about the attack or the couple's communications - and because its contents are encrypted, they won't unless they can get the passcode to unlock it. The phone was issued by Farook's employer, the county of San Bernardino.\n\nInvestigators can't just try random passcodes until they hit on the right one, either. The phone has apparently enabled an Apple security feature - a sort of self-destruct option that would render the phone's data unreadable after 10 incorrect passcode attempts.\n\nThe judge's order requires Apple to create a unique software package - one Apple CEO Tim Cook described as \"a new version of the iPhone operating system\" - that would allow investigators to bypass the self-destruct system. The same software would also let the government enter passcodes electronically, eliminating both the tedium of manual entry and the enforced delays the iPhone system imposes after a few wrong guesses.\n\nApple opposes the order, arguing that such software would amount to a security \"backdoor\" that would ultimately make iPhone users across the globe more vulnerable to information or identity theft. Both the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have pledged to support Apple, saying that the government's request endangers security and privacy.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, making such software shouldn't be difficult for Apple, experts say. But once created, it would be nearly impossible to contain, says Ajay Arora, CEO and co-founder of Vera, a startup that provides companies with encryption services.\n\n\"Imagine if that got into the wrong hands,\" he says. \"What they're asking for is a God key - and once you get that, there's no going back.\"\n\nThe demands being made of Apple border on the bizarre, says Lee Tien, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \"Asking a technology company to make its security less secure is a crazy, stupid thing to do,\" he says. \"It's like asking water not to be wet.\"\n\nThe government's best bet may be to argue that its request doesn't actually create a backdoor, even if that's how Apple characterizes the request, says Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department attorney. But Apple is probably right to worry that a government win in this case will lead to broader requests down the road.\n\n\"If the court rules in favor of the government, then I think the stage has been set for the next step, which is, 'Thanks for removing the auto-wipe. Now you need to help us defeat the code',\" Cattanach says. \"If you're the government, you're going to ask for that.\"\n\n__\n\nAP Technology Writers Brandon Bailey and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler.

That means you'll have to pay a fair bit to rent or buy individual movies -- typically $4 or $5 to rent and $10 to $15 to buy (even more for high-definition quality). True, there are also cheaper and less legal ways to watch, but we aren't going there.\n\nFive of the eight best-picture nominees are available online. Add the acting categories, and you can watch nine of the 15 nominees. In all, you can watch 30 of the 57 nominated full-length movies and shorts. An additional two, including best-picture nominee \"Brooklyn,\" are due out before the Feb. 28 awards show.\n\nHere's your viewing guide:\n\nBEST PICTURE AND DIRECTING\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is the only best-picture nominee available through a subscription service, HBO Now. If you have a cable subscription with HBO, you can catch it on HBO Go. You can buy, but not rent, \"Mad Max\" through iTunes, Google Play or Amazon.\n\n\"Spotlight\" and \"Room\" are available only as a purchase for now, though iTunes says you can start renting either next Tuesday. \"Bridges of Spies\" and \"The Martian\" are available to buy or rent. \"Brooklyn\" is coming next Tuesday, though a rental option might not be available right away.\n\nFor \"The Big Short\" and \"The Revenant,\" you still need to head to the theater. Although major services are taking advance orders, none say when it will be available. Don't be duped if you see \"The Revenant\" on Amazon -- it's an unrelated 2009 movie with the same name.\n\nAll five nominees for best directing overlap with best picture, so if you manage all eight, you're good to go. Once again, you'll need to visit a theater for \"The Big Short\" and \"The Revenant.\"\n\nACTING CATEGORIES\n\nExcept for \"Mad Max,\" the best-picture nominees have contenders for one or more acting categories as well.\n\nNone of the eight remaining movies with acting nominees are available through a subscription service.\n\n\"Creed\" and \"The Danish Girl\" are available for purchase; iTunes says \"The Danish Girl\" can also be rented starting Tuesday. \"Trumbo\" is available to buy or rent -- get the 2015 drama starring Bryan Cranston, not the 2007 documentary. \"Steve Jobs\" is also available to buy or rent through several leading services, including iTunes -- the service the real Jobs founded as Apple's CEO.\n\n\"Carol\" will be released online on March 4 -- too late for your Oscar pools. You can advance-order \"Joy\" and \"The Hateful Eight,\" but there's no firm release date listed. You'll also need to find \"45 Years\" in theaters.\n\nSCREENPLAY NOMINEES\n\n\"Ex Machina\" is available with an Amazon Prime subscription and for rent or purchase through most leading services.\n\n\"Room\" and \"Spotlight\" require a purchase, at least until next week, while \"Bridges of Spies,\" ''Inside Out,\" ''Straight Outta Compton\" and \"The Martian\" can be rented or bought (to rent \"Inside Out,\" go to Amazon).\n\n\"Brooklyn\" is coming next Tuesday. That means theatrical visits for \"Carol\" and \"The Big Short.\"\n\nFULL-LENGTH DOCUMENTARIES\n\nAll five nominees are available online.\n\n\"Amy\" is available to Amazon Prime subscribers, while \"Cartel Land,\" ''What Happened, Miss Simone?\" and \"Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom\" are available on Netflix. \"Amy\" and \"Cartel Land\" are also available for rent or purchase. The other two were produced by Netflix, so you won't find them elsewhere.\n\n\"The Look of Silence\" is available to rent or buy through leading services.\n\nFULL-LENGTH CARTOONS\n\n\"Inside Out\" and \"Shaun The Sheep Movie\" are the only ones available to rent or buy.\n\n\"Anomalisa\" isn't expected online until March 15. \"Anomalisa\" and \"Boy and the World\" are still playing in theaters -- at least in a few major U.S. cities. \"When Marnie Was There\" is no longer in theaters, though you can buy a DVD or Blu-ray disc. (A side note: Most movies released online are also available on disc, but that's so old-school).\n\nTHE 15 SHORTS\n\nNetflix -- and only Netflix -- has \"World of Tomorrow,\" nominated for animated short, and \"Chau, Beyond The Lines\" and \"Last Day of Freedom,\" both nominated for documentary short. \"Ave Maria,\" nominated for live action short, is available for purchase on iTunes. The rest aren't available online yet.\n\nThe cable channel Shorts HD sometimes sells bundles of Oscar-nominated shorts online, but there's no word yet on its plans this year. The shorts nominees are much easier to catch in theaters these days, but doing so requires getting off the couch.\n\nFOREIGN LANGUAGE\n\n\"Theeb\" is expected online Friday, at least for buying.

All four have limited theatrical releases, which means you might have to get to New York or Los Angeles if you're not already there.\n\nTHE REST\n\nThere are nine movies nominated only for other, lower-profile categories such as music and makeup.\n\nEight of them are available for purchase, and some are also available as rentals. In addition, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" can be streamed with an HBO Now subscription, while \"The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared\" comes with Amazon Prime. \"Cinderella\" is available through Starz as a $9-a-month supplement to an Amazon Prime membership.\n\nThat leaves just one more: \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Advance orders are being taken for a digital copy, but there's no release date yet.

It could have implications for privacy and free speech across the world.\n\n\"While people in the United States may not see that as a real, concrete threat,\" Kay says, \"it's a threat to billions of people around the world -- who are in situations where the government really wants to know what you're searching, who you're talking to.

Apple says providing this help is the real danger. We've reached a boiling point in the battle between tech companies and the government over encryption. And what happens will affect anyone who uses a smartphone, including you.\n\nAfter the San Bernardino shootings, the FBI seized the iPhone used by shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The FBI has a warrant to search the phone's contents, and because it was Farook's work phone, the FBI also has permission from the shooter's employer, the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, to search the device. Legally, the FBI can and should search this phone. That's not up for debate. If the FBI gets a warrant to search a house and the people who own it say OK, there's no ambiguity about whether it can search the house.\n\nBut if the FBI comes across a safe in that house, the warrant and permission do not mean it can force the company that manufactures the safe to create a special tool for opening its safes, especially a tool that would make other safes completely useless as secure storage. That's the situation that Apple's dealing with here.\n\nThe FBI obtained an order from a California district court asking Apple for assistance cracking Farook's passcode. The court order doesn't flat-out demand that Apple unlock the phone, which is an iPhone 5C running iOS 9. Instead, the judge is asking Apple to create a new, custom, terrorist-phone-specific version of its iOS software to help the FBI unlock the phone. Security researcher Dan Guido has a great analysis of why it is technically possible for Apple to comply and create this software. (It would not be if Farook had used an iPhone 6, because Apple created a special security protection called the Secure Enclave for its newer phones that cannot be manipulated by customising iOS.)\n\nThe fight isn't over whether Apple can comply in this case. It's whether it should.\n\nIf Apple makes this software, it will allow the FBI to bypass security measures, including an auto-delete function that erases the key needed to decrypt data once a passcode is entered incorrectly after ten tries as well as a timed delay after each wrong password guess. Since the FBI wants to use the brute force cracking method -- basically, trying every possible password -- both of those protections need to go to crack Farook's passcode. (Of course, if he used a shitty password like 1234, the delay wouldn't be as big a problem, since the FBI could quickly guess.)\n\nThe security measures that the FBI wants to get around are crucial privacy features on iOS9, because they safeguard your phone against criminals and spies using the brute force attack. So it's not surprising that Apple is opposing the court order. There is more than one person's privacy at stake here!\n\nApple equates building a new version of iOS with building an encryption backdoor. CEO Tim Cook published a message emphasising that the company can't build a backdoor for one iPhone without screwing over security for the rest:\n\nIn today's digital world, the \"key\" to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.\n\nThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.\n\nApple will be writing its own malware if it complies with this order. It would be creating the best tool to break into its own (older) devices.\n\n\"Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone,\" the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote in a statement supporting Apple. \"And once that master key is created, we're certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security.\"\n\nDon't sit there chuckling if you use an Android, by the way. If Apple is compelled to create this malware, it will affect anyone who uses technology to communicate, to bank, to shop, to do pretty much anything. The legal basis for requesting this assistance is the All Writs Act of 1789, an 18th century law that is becoming a favourite for US government agencies trying to get tech companies to turn over user data. The AWA is not really as obscure as Apple suggests, but it is a very broad statute that allows courts established by Congress to \"issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law\".\n\nThe Department of Justice has even tried to use it to force Apple to turn over suspects' messages before. I know 18th century law sounds boring, but this is an 18th century law that could screw you big time.\n\nThe All Writs Act can only force a company to do something if it's not an \"undue burden\". Seems like making Apple create malware that will fundamentally undermine its core security features is an enormous burden. And if it's not deemed \"undue\" in this case, that sets a horrible precedent. After all, if compelling Apple to maim itself is allowed, compelling Google and Facebook and Microsoft to write security backdoors would also be allowed.\n\nImage: Getty\n\nHave you subscribed to Gizmodo Australia's email newsletter?

TECHNOLOGY U.S. appeals court upholds Apple e-book settlement\n\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld Apple's $450 million settlement of claims that it harmed consumers by conspiring with five publishers to raise e-book prices.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City rejected a challenge by e-books purchaser John Bradley to the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of Apple's class-action antitrust settlement with consumers and 33 state attorneys general.\n\nU.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan had approved the settlement in November 2014. Apple agreed to the accord after Cote in July 2013 found it liable for having played a \"central role\" in a conspiracy with the publishers to eliminate retail price competition and undercut market leader Amazon.com's dominance.\n\nThe alleged conspiracy caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from Amazon's $9.99 price, according to the Justice Department. Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit later upheld Cote's liability finding.\n\nApple has appealed that finding to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying it could harm competition and the economy.

John Kasich addresses supporters during a campaign stop at Michigan State University on Monday.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Donald Trump and John Kasich criticized Apple on Wednesday for opposing a court order to hack the iPhone of the shooter who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December.\n\nThe FBI obtained a court order for Apple to unlock the iPhone 5c of shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed by police along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, calling it a necessary part of its terrorism investigation. The iPhone, including models that run on operating system iOS 9 have built-in encryption, so data on the phone cannot be accessed by Apple engineers.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook in a letter to consumers opposed the order, explaining that writing code to break the encryption and enable a \"backdoor to the iPhone\" would endanger the cybersecurity and privacy of its users. He said that such a tool does not currently exist, that it would be capable of unlocking any iPhone in someone's physical possession and that there was no guarantee its use would be limited to the investigation at hand.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's official position is that he is not seeking legislation to weaken encryption, but White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday told reporters that the FBI and DOJ \"have the full support\" of the administration in their terrorism investigation.\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to create a new backdoor to one of its products,\" Earnest said. \"They are simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\"\n\nTrump criticized Apple's stance on Wednesday in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"Fox & Friends,\" calling it \"common sense\" to break the encryption as part of the investigation.\n\n\"I agree 100 percent with the courts,\" Trump said. \"Who do they think they are? They have to open it up.\"\n\nKasich also defended the order for Apple to unlock Farook's iPhone in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\n\"I don't think it's an example of government overreach to say that, you know, we had terrorists here on our soil and we've got to understand more detail about who they may have been communicating with,\" the Ohio governor said.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican candidate, told Reuters the encryption debate is \"a tough issue\" that requires more collaboration between the government and Silicon Valley, and that he hopes Apple will comply with the order \"voluntarily.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, I think being a good corporate citizen is important ,\" Rubio said.\n\nNumerous candidates have vaguely proposed improving coordination between government and the tech industry to help prevent terrorist attacks. During a recent Democratic presidential debate Hillary Clinton said the government should launch a \"Manhattan-like project\" to \"bring the government and tech communities together\" rather than debating the creation of backdoors to bypass encryption.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's rival for the Democratic nomination, is an outspoken critic of surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency but has not addressed the issue of Apple's encryption.\n\nFarook's iPhone was the property of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, which he used during his work as a public health inspector, and the FBI obtained possession of it with permission from the county, according to court documents.\n\nFulfilling the order would set a dangerous precedent by requiring the company to create new software to undermine security, said Kevin Bankston , director of the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute.\n\n\"If Apple builds this backdoor software, our government - and less savory governments around the world - will demand to use this new software every time they encounter an encrypted iPhone,\" Bankston said in a statement.\u200b \"It likely could also compel any other software provider to do the same.\"", "Federal investigators want access to the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.\n\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple (AAPL), is not prepared to give them that access.\n\nOn Tuesday, the feds obtained a court ruling that essentially commands Apple to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It wants Apple to come up with software that would bypass an iPhone security feature ... one that wipes the device's data clean after too many failed unlocking attempts.\n\nApple does not want to capitulate to that demand. It argues that honoring such a request would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten all iPhone customers' security and right to privacy.\n\nIn a courageous and controversial letter challenging the court's ruling, Cook wrote:\n\nThe United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\n\nI must say that saying \"no\" to a federal judge is a brave stance, and I admire that.\n\nYet terrorists such as those who slaughtered 14 people and injured 20 others should be examined intensely. The FBI could benefit from seeing how the plan was executed, who else might be involved and who was behind the operation.\n\nLet me ask you this ...\n\nIf that involves unlocking a single cell phone, should the FBI have the tools to do so?\n\nThis argument goes back to the issue of privacy vs. security.\n\nYes, we all want as much privacy from prying governmental eyes as possible. Moreover, we generally don't want to sacrifice our liberty for the sake of security, because then we end up \"deserving neither\" as Ben Franklin famously warned.\n\nBut does giving the FBI access to one terrorist's cell phone via an encryption tool really threaten our liberty?\n\nA valid and strong argument can be made that yes, it does.\n\nThis is especially true when you are trying to compel a private company to provide you with the tools to not only break that single cell phone ... but also the tools to basically break into any similar phone, anywhere in the world.\n\nThe precedent here that Tim Cook fears most was explained in his letter challenging the court's ruling.\n\nAccording to Cook:\n\n... the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\n\nSpecifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\n\nBasically, Tim Cook doesn't want to give the keys to the personal data kingdom to the FBI, no matter how noble or important that particular one-time investigative use might be.\n\nCook went on to write:\n\n... make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.\n\nAs we all know, the potential for abuse by the federal government isn't just a hypothetical.\n\nThe mass collection of data by the National Security Agency, famously revealed by Edward Snowden, was just the most-recent example of governmental overreach in the name of security.\n\nAs Cook and other cybersecurity experts have explained, what the government is asking Apple to do amounts to essentially a \"hack\" on its own users ...\n\nA hack that would undermine the security advancements that currently protect customer data from cybercriminals and/or others with nefarious intent.\n\nCook finishes the letter in a classy way, writing:\n\nWhile we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\n\nThis is an example of principle in action, and it's actually quite uncommon.\n\nGranted, I hate the idea of the FBI not having as much access as is necessary to prevent another act of terror on U.S. soil. But the legal compulsion of a private company to provide a tool that essentially undermines its own products is arguably a much more dangerous long-term precedent.\n\nThis is a case to me where principle must prevail over expediency, and one in which privacy must come out on top over security.\n\n***\n\nDo you agree with Tim Cook on this principled refusal to capitulate to federal demands? Or, do you think Cook is abdicating his responsibility as an American to help protect and defend his fellow citizens against terrorism?\n\nTell me what you think about this controversial issue by leaving me a comment on our website or sending me an e-mail.\n\nStocks continued to trend higher Wednesday, as a bump in oil prices allowed traders to keep buying what is still an extremely oversold market.

Why does the U.S. government need Apple's help?\n\nA. The government wants Apple to provide technical assistance to help it break into Farook's phone. Apple's mobile operating system encrypts virtually all of its data so that forensics experts cannot access email, text messages, photos or other information unless they enter a password.\n\nThe phone requires two digital \"keys\" to unscramble the data: a passcode entered by the user when they want to use the device and a unique 256-bit AES key that is coded into the hardware during manufacture. The hardware key cannot be removed from the device, which prevents hackers from copying the contents of its hard drive and then cracking the passcode with the help of powerful computers.\n\nApple's mobile iOS system offers an auto-erase function that will wipe the device after 10 failed attempts to unlock it. The government says it is not sure if Farook enabled that function but has not attempted to unlock it because it does not want to risk losing the data.\n\nQ. What exactly does the government want Apple to do?\n\nA. The government has asked Apple to create a new version of iOS that disables the auto-erase function. It also requested the new software circumvent a feature that causes delays of up to one hour when nine wrong passwords are entered - making it possible to break into the phone using the \"brute force\" method of trying millions of different passwords. The government says it is possible for Apple to create software that will only work on the device used by Farook.\n\nQ. What are Apple's objections?\n\nA. Apple says that such a tool would essentially create a \"backdoor\" that could be used by the FBI or others to break into any iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a letter to customers, cited the possibility of the specially created software falling into the \"wrong hands\" and rejected the notion that it would only be used in this single case.\n\nCook also said that the move would establish a dangerous precedent. \"The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge,\" he said.\n\nQ. Is Apple right?\n\nA. It is not clear why Apple would worry about the specially created software being stolen or misused, since the work would take place in Apple's labs and would presumably be no more subject to theft than any other Apple software. Apple is known for its strong security and there are no known incidents of its source code or cryptographic keys being stolen.\n\nFurther, the same technique would not work on devices launched after the 5c because they are equipped with a chip known as \"Secure Enclave,\" which helps encrypt data using both the password and a unique user ID that is provisioned during manufacturing and not known to Apple.\n\nThe bigger concern is the precedent. If Apple complied, it would mark the first time a software company created a tool to break into its own products in response to an order from law enforcement. Technology companies and privacy advocates fear an endless stream of similar requests - not just from the U.S. government, but also from foreign governments and even litigants in civil cases. Technologists are horrified by the very idea of deliberately creating software that undermines security.\n\nQ. Why is practical compromise impossible here?\n\nA. Apple is drawing a line in the sand to avoid setting a precedent.\n\nQ. What information is the government seeking?\n\nA. Prosecutors say they believe data on the phone could help determine who Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik communicated with as they planned the shootings, where they traveled to before and after the attack, and other details about the attack.\n\nQ. Will all the data the government wants be on the device?\n\nA. Not necessarily. Even if the government is right in its assumption that the phone was used to plan that attack, Farook may have used encrypted apps that wipe all evidence of communications. For example, Islamic State uses an mobile messaging service known as Telegram for propaganda and recruitment. The service allows the group to broadcast messages to large numbers of followers, then move to private, one-to-one encrypted messaging that likely cannot be retrieved by forensics experts.\n\nQ. Are there similar issues with Android devices?\n\nA. Smartphones powered by Google's Android operating system offer a variety of encryption options, depending on the manufacturer and model. Forensic technicians can \"bypass\" passcodes on some of the devices, according to a November report by Manhattan's district attorney. Google can remotely reset the passcodes, when served with a search warrant and an order instructing them to assist law enforcement to extract data, allowing authorities to view contents of a device.\n\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)", "WASHINGTON -- An extraordinary legal fight is brewing with major privacy implications for millions of cellphone users after a federal magistrate ordered Apple Inc. to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the gunman in the San Bernardino mass shootings.\n\nThe clash brings to a head a long-simmering debate between technology companies insistent on protecting digital privacy and law enforcement agencies concerned about losing their ability to recover evidence or eavesdrop on the communications of terrorists or criminals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House quickly disputed the contention by Apple's chief executive officer, Tim Cook, that the Obama administration is seeking to force the software company to build a \"backdoor\" to bypass digital locks protecting consumer information on Apple's popular iPhones.\n\nThe early arguments set the stage for what will likely be a protracted policy and public relations fight in the courts, on Capitol Hill, on the Internet and elsewhere.\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. \"They're simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\"\n\nWithin hours of the judge's order on Tuesday telling Apple to aid the FBI with special software in the case, Cook promised a court challenge. He said the software the FBI would need to unlock the gunman's work-issued iPhone 5C would be \"too dangerous to create\" and \"undeniably\" a backdoor.\n\nCook compared it to a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks, and said there was no way to keep the technique secret once it was developed.\n\n\"Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\" Cook said.\n\nAt the center of the debate is the private information carried on nearly 900 million iPhones sold worldwide: Photographs, videos, chat messages, health records and more.\n\nThere also was swift reaction on the presidential campaign trail, where Donald Trump told Fox News that he agreed \"100 percent with the courts,\" and on Capitol Hill, where the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, R-N.C., said, \"Court orders are not optional and Apple should comply.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who fought encryption in the 1990s, said she thought the government should be able to access the phone. On Twitter, Edward Snowden called it \"the most important tech case in a decade.\"\n\nBut Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., called the Justice Department's request \"unconscionable and unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym represents a significant victory for the Justice Department, which last year decided not to pursue a legislative fix to address encryption but has now scored a win instead in the courts.\n\nFederal officials until now have struggled to identify a high-profile case to make its concerns resonate. But in siding with the government, Pym, a former federal prosecutor, was persuaded that agents investigating the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11 had been hobbled by their inability to unlock the county-owned phone used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in December before dying in a police shootout.\n\nThe dispute places Apple, one of the world's most respected companies, on the side of protecting the digital privacy of an accused Islamic terrorist.\n\n\"We have no sympathy for terrorists,\" Cook said.\n\nApple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. The phone Farook was using, running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, was configured to erase data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful unlocking attempts.\n\nThe magistrate ordered Apple to create special software the FBI could load onto the phone to bypass the self-destruct feature. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nThe Justice Department said it was asking Apple to help unlock only the iPhone used by Farook and owned by the county government where he worked as an environmental inspector. The judge said the software should include a \"unique identifier\" so that it can't be used to unlock other iPhones.\n\n\"If a court can legally compel Apple to do that, then it likely could legally compel any other software provider to do the same thing,\" including helping the government install tracking or eavesdropping software on a phone or laptop, said Kevin Bankston, director of the Open Technology Institute at New America.\n\nIt was unclear how readily the software might be modified to work against other iPhones, or how quickly Apple might update its own software to render the new bypass ineffective.\n\nThe next step in the case wasn't immediately clear, either. The judge gave Apple five days to contest the order as unreasonably burdensome. A magistrate judge on the lowest rung of the federal judiciary almost certainly could not establish meaningful precedent without affirmation from a higher-court judge, which means the fight is likely to proceed up the chain.\n\nThe former head of the FBI division responsible for producing some of the FBI's most cunning surveillance tools, Marcus Thomas, said Apple faces a challenge in showing that the government's request is overly burdensome. Thomas, the chief technology officer at Subsentio LLC, said companies that build ultra-secure products that might be used by criminals or terrorists can expect government requests for help.\n\n\"Society wants to know that companies aren't producing these complicated services and devices that can be used as weapons against them,\" he said.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- Faced with a federal judge's order to help investigators break into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, Apple may well argue that the request places an unreasonable burden on the company.\n\nIn fact, experts say that complying with the government's request wouldn't be particularly challenging for Apple.

Why does the U.S. government need Apple's help?\n\nA. The government wants Apple to provide technical assistance to help it break into Farook's phone. Apple's mobile operating system encrypts virtually all of its data so that forensics experts cannot access email, text messages, photos or other information unless they enter a password.\n\nThe phone requires two digital \"keys\" to unscramble the data: a passcode entered by the user when they want to use the device and a unique 256-bit AES key that is coded into the hardware during manufacture. The hardware key cannot be removed from the device, which prevents hackers from copying the contents of its hard drive and then cracking the passcode with the help of powerful computers.\n\nApple's mobile iOS system offers an auto-erase function that will wipe the device after 10 failed attempts to unlock it. The government says it is not sure if Farook enabled that function but has not attempted to unlock it because it does not want to risk losing the data.\n\nQ.

Syed Raheel Farook is a Navy veteran who earned medals for fighting global terrorism.\n\nBy Gillian Flaccus and Amanda Lee Myers, Associated Press\n\nThursday, Feb. 18, 2016 | 3:26 p.m.\n\nCORONA, Calif. -- FBI agents on Thursday searched the California home belonging to a family member of the husband-and-wife killers who massacred 14 people in the San Bernardino terror attack, but the relative was not arrested and has not been named a suspect.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, is a military veteran who earned medals for fighting global terrorism. The search warrant is sealed, and FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller would not disclose any information other than to confirm a search was conducted at a home in the city of Corona in an ongoing investigation.\n\nTo serve a search warrant, authorities must have probable cause a crime was committed and items connected to the crime are likely to be found at the location.\n\nMessages left for attorneys representing the Farook family were not immediately returned.\n\nStacy Mozer, who lives around the corner from the home, said he watched as agents carried away armloads of boxes filled with manila envelopes, a computer tower and stacks of paper. At least a dozen agents were present.\n\nHe described Raheel Farook and wife Tatiana as ideal neighbors. The couple drove another neighbor to doctor's appointments last year when she had cancer surgery, treated her to meals out and fetched her prescriptions for her, even paying for them, he said.\n\nThe couple frequently strolled with their 1-year-old daughter around the community of town homes and took her to the pool.\n\n\"I would find it very hard to believe that they would be involved in any way,\" he said. \"I do know that if you have a family member, you don't have control of their lives, and I don't think they had control of their brother's life.\"\n\nMozer said the family's home was searched twice after the December shooting, and authorities broke down the door on an earlier occasion.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Dec. 2 at a meeting of his San Bernardino County co-workers. They died hours later in a shootout with police. The 14 people killed marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nFarook's family has said it had no inkling about the plot.\n\nRaheel Farook was a Navy information system technician from 2003 to 2007, military records show. He was stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and received the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards.\n\nThe chief of the FBI's Los Angeles field office told The Associated Press last month that some of the most basic questions related to the shootings had not been answered, including whether anyone else was involved. At the time, David Bowdich said investigators were not looking past anyone and had \"a very open mind on this investigation.\"\n\nThe search of the Farook home came a day after Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would fight federal government efforts to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the gunman.\n\nSo far, the only person charged in connection with the attack is Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor of Rizwan Farook's. Marquez is charged with providing the assault rifles used in the massacre, making false statements about when he bought the weapons and conspiring with Rizwan Farook on a pair of previously planned attacks that were never carried out.\n\nMarquez also faces charges of marriage fraud and lying on immigration paperwork. The FBI said he acknowledged that he was paid $200 a month to marry the sister of Raheel Farook's wife, and he lied on immigration papers that he lived with her so she could stay in the U.S.\n\nMarquez and his wife listed their address at the same Corona home that was searched by the FBI on Thursday.\n\nMyers reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writer Amy Taxin in Tustin contributed to this report.", "2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe dead have few if any rights (well, other than a dead celebrity in California), but Apple, and an array of left-wing supporters, are defending the rights of the San Bernardino terrorist shooters not to have their iPhones searched. (The particular phone in question was the property of the employer of Syed Rizwan Farook, the husband in the duo.)\n\nThe FBI, in possession of the dead shooter's phone, has been stymied in its efforts to break into the device by a doomsday mechanism that wipes the phone after multiple unsuccessful password tries. The FBI has requested, and now a court has ordered, Apple to disable this doomsday feature, allowing the FBI to try as many combinations as necessary. Apple responded with a public letter from CEO Tim Cook, saying such a move would put all its users at personal risk, and that it would appeal the ruling. Donald Trump thereupon jumped in to ask just exactly who Apple thinks it is.\n\nIn this, Trump has once again raised the obvious issue: how did Apple become responsible for our security?\n\nThe FBI is presumably looking for other bad guys who Farook and Tashfeen Malik may have plotted or communicated with. But Apple's Cook in his letter quickly dismissed that as a small potatoes issue and threw a blanket of principle over any efforts by law enforcement to mess with the iPhone or, it seems, any encryption methods at all. Apple, Cook insisted, is protecting our security while the FBI is undermining it.\n\nThis is part of the Snowden effect, a view of the world that emerged after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden released stolen documents showing the extent of the government's data collection -- much of it through cellphones. In this new world, not only does the government's interest in data and its access to technology have vast, if unspecified, conspiratorial implications, but it is one in which technology companies, if they are found to have offered any assistance, get awfully bad press.\n\nExtending Apple some sort of benefit of the doubt, it is not clear whether the company truly sees itself as an ultimate protector and enforcer of a new tech order, existing beyond the capabilities of courts and government authority to regulate, or if it is, in the Snowden age, just doing some proactive PR and marketing.\n\nIt's certainly quite a melodramatic and chest beating letter, not to mention a fairly preposterous one.\n\nInstead of limiting the issue to the two dead shooters and, merely, accommodating the FBI by providing the data on the phone in question, Apple has elevated the FBI's demand to \"dangerous precedent,\" deeming it the first domino in a sequence that would, in Apple's telling, make everybody's phone transparent to all the world's bunko artists, sleazebags and brigands. (I am, in this, being no less broad than Apple in its evocation of \"sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals.\")\n\nSaid Cook: \"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.\"\n\nActually, the government is saying it will use this as entr\u00e9e to only one phone. That it \"could\" be used widely and as a universal pass key is entirely theoretical. (Technology people often operate on the basis of untested metaphors relating virtual life to real life -- hence, this request is like a pass key, rather than, say, akin to the New York City subway advisory that \"large backpacks are subject to random search by the police.\") The government, Cook goes on, \"could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge.\"\n\nThat's the nub of the argument and of Apple's agitprop. The government is the enemy, even the operative villain in modern life, perfidiously or mindlessly intent on taking away the privacy of its citizens. Technology companies, on the other hand, have created all manner of tools to protect our privacy.\n\nCome again? In some more precise ontological understanding, it is technology companies that have not only created the means by which our privacy is, on a constantly expanding basis, ever-more lost, but they are the prime beneficiaries of this access to messages, heath records, financial data and all the rest.\n\nIt is technology companies whose foremost business goal is to protect their data monopolies and, indeed, the illusion that privacy exists (pay no attention to the fact that we are not private to them).\n\nEdward Snowden, whose theft and escape were enabled by encryption protocols, has been an active tweeter on the side of Apple in the current debate. Snowden, perhaps honorably but quite mindlessly, too, showed both how communication devices potentially compromise our privacy and, as well, how would-be terrorists might circumvent such exposure and protect their dastardly plans. In response, technology companies must grandly assert the virtue of their devices, and law enforcement must dig deeper into them.\n\n2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1XAHT04", "Verizon Communications once aspired to be the Comcast of mobile, streaming movies and TV shows to its 107 million monthly subscribers.

More than 139 million Americans watched video on a smartphone at least once a month in 2015, a number that's expected to jump 22 percent, to 169 million, by 2018, according to estimates by researcher EMarketer.\n\nVerizon's Go90, named after people's tendency to flip their phone sideways to watch movies and videos, premiered as an app for Apple and Android phones in October and is available to customers of other carriers. The service is aimed mainly at teens and twentysomethings, for whom video watching is a social experience. There's a \"cut and share\" feature that lets users share clips with their Facebook friends and Twitter followers.\n\nGo90's lineup includes shows from ESPN, NFL Network, MTV, VH1, and the Food Network. To supplement that, the carrier has commissioned more than 50 exclusive series from CollegeHumor, Vice, and Endemol Beyond USA, among others. Live broadcasts of sporting events such as NBA games (subject to additional fees) and concerts are also part of the mix. \"If you look at mobile handset penetration, increased data speeds, and the viability of video offerings on mobile, it's just getting better with time,\" says Tom Gorke, executive vice president for sales and content distribution at Viacom, which owns Comedy Central and several of the other networks supplying Go90. \"Verizon is the largest mobile operator in the country. Everyone would be eager to do a deal with someone that large.\"\n\nIn a move that may tip the playing field, Verizon announced in early February that data usage on Go90 won't count toward customers' caps. Rivals such as Netflix and YouTube Red, a $9.99-a-month subscription service introduced in October, would have to pay the carrier for their offerings to enjoy the same treatment. Executives at Verizon didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe company's initial goal was to deliver subscribers a full package of live TV, on-demand shows, pay-per-view events, and games. It shifted gears last summer after it became clear that negotiating streaming rights with broadcasters and media companies would be difficult and time-consuming. Apple and AT&T have postponed their own video streaming services for similar reasons.\n\nUnlike YouTube Red and Netflix, Go90 is free. Verizon is counting on ads to pay for the service. In the U.S., mobile video ad spending is growing faster than any other type of digital advertising: EMarketer estimates it reached $2.8 billion in 2015 and will double, to almost $6 billion, by 2018. Growth would be even stronger, EMarketer said in a report in June, if there were more consensus between ad buyers and sellers on audience metrics and pricing.\n\nUsing the trove of information it has collected on its wireless subscribers, including age, gender, general interests, and location, Verizon says it can help marketers flash their ads to the right people at the right time. With its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL in May, the carrier acquired a well-established programmatic ad platform -- where machines, not people, make decisions about which ads run where. \"AOL gives Go90 real-time ad sales,\" says Roger Entner, an analyst with wireless industry strategist Recon Analytics. \"Without that, Verizon would have to rely on someone else like Google to provide the ad platform.\"\n\nDuring an earnings calls in January, Verizon's chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said the service had surpassed expectations. He declined to give specifics other than that the app had been downloaded some 2 million times. He tamped down expectations of a quick return. \"Go90 will not be a profitable product probably within a one-year to two-year horizon,\" he said.\n\nWalt Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG, an institutional brokerage, thinks Go90 may be even more of a long shot. \"Sure, you can have fewer, higher-quality ads that companies are willing to pay more for, but you are going to need a lot of customers like that to even begin to move the needle for a company of Verizon's size,\" he says.\n\nThe bottom line: With Go90, Verizon is looking to capture a share of mobile ad spending, which is forecast to double by 2018, to almost $6 billion.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "Apple has come under fire for \"bricking\" iOS devices that have been fixed by third-party repair shops. After the repairs are done, iOS device users reported that they received an \"Error 53\" message which would lock up their iPhones or iPads. Apple has insisted that this is a \"security feature\" but the company has now done an about-faced on this issue.\n\n\"Error 53\" was first thought to be a security bug but was later revealed to be a mechanism put in place by Apple itself to prevent unauthorised repairers from fixing iOS devices. Considering Apple authorised repairers charge a lot more to fix devices than other repairers, customers were furious and \"Error 53\" was seen as a way for the company to squeeze more money out of users. Even the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) got involved.\n\nUnder mounting criticism, Apple has changed its (i)tune on \"Error 53\" and has removed the feature from iOS devices with its latest software update. Here's what Apple said to TechCrunch about the matter:\n\nSome customers' devices are showing 'Connect to iTunes' after attempting an iOS update or a restore from iTunes on a Mac or PC. This reports as an Error 53 in iTunes and appears when a device fails a security test. This test was designed to check whether Touch ID works properly before the device leaves the factory.\n\nToday, Apple released a software update that allows customers who have encountered this error message to successfully restore their device using iTunes on a Mac or PC.\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience, this was designed to be a factory test and was not intended to affect customers. Customers who paid for an out-of-warranty replacement of their device based on this issue should contact AppleCare about a reimbursement.\n\nSo Apple's claim that it was a \"security feature\" wasn't exactly true. At least the company is owning up to its mistakes.\n\n[Via TechCrunch]\n\nHave you subscribed to Lifehacker Australia's email newsletter?

He uses his Venmo app at least three times a month to pay his rent or reimburse a friend who picks up the check at dinner. \"I'll just Venmo them right then,\" says the 25-year-old San Francisco photographer. He's also been using Apple Pay in emergencies -- like the time he paid for gas when he forgot his wallet on a road trip. \"I think of it as I am using Apple Pay\" rather than Bank of America, says Silva, who's linked his account at the lender with Apple Pay.\n\nThat attitude concerns financial institutions, which believe mobile payment services such as Venmo and Apple Pay could erode loyalty, particularly among millennials, who surveys show are more prone to switching banks than their elders. \"The biggest risk for them is their relationship with their customer,\" says Zilvinas Bareisis, a senior analyst at Celent, a consulting firm. Surprisingly, most banks aren't putting up much of a fight. Only 5 percent of U.S. banks Celent polled in November had a branded wallet app that works in stores for Android phones, and just 17 percent planned to release one in the coming 6 to 12 months. (Most third-party in-store wallets are incompatible with iPhones.)\n\nMany institutions seem prepared to cede the field to Google, Apple, and Samsung, all of which have a head start. Apple Pay, introduced in 2014, appears to be getting the most traction in the U.S., where some 12 million people use it at least once a month, a number that should more than double, to 25 million, by yearend, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.\n\nApple Pay isn't the first digital payment technology to pose a challenge for the banking industry -- pioneer PayPal has been around since 1998. But the stakes are much bigger now that Walmart stores, Starbucks cafes, and Chevron gas stations are among those retooling to handle payments through digital wallets. Researcher EMarketer estimates the value of transactions made by tapping or waving a phone at the point of sale will reach $210 billion by 2019, up from $8.7 billion last year.\n\n\"We see a day when customers are leaving their home without their card,\" says Jonathan Velline, head of ATM and store strategy at Wells Fargo. Already, 82 percent of banks are concerned about ensuring that theirs becomes or stays the most-used card in the digital wallet, while 61 percent worry that Apple and other tech giants may encroach deeper into their territory, according to the Celent survey. Maureen Burns, a partner in Bain's financial-services practice, says \"the worst-case scenario\" for banks is that they're reduced to playing the role of a utility, in which \"they have the risk and regulatory burden but don't get to participate in the best parts of the profit pool.\"\n\nApple has never disclosed the fees it charges banks to process Apple Pay transactions, but analysts figure it collects half a cent on in-store debit card purchases and 15 basis points on credit cards in the U.S. The service generated just $15 million in gross revenue for Apple in the first year of operation, according to Richard Crone, chief executive officer of Crone Consulting, a firm that specializes in mobile payments. Crone figures that could top $1 billion annually in five years if ad revenue is factored in.\n\nIn October, Capital One became the first U.S. institution to introduce its own wallet app that works in stores. \"The irony is, when we first launched payments, people began to ask us, 'Why would we use a bank for payments vs. digital company XYZ?'\u2009\" says Tom Poole, managing vice president for digital payments. He says the wallet has been \"a success\" but won't say how many customers are using it. \"Banks were asleep at the wheel and didn't offer customers alternatives,\" he adds. JPMorgan Chase will unveil its own mobile wallet in mid-2016. As the largest retail bank in the U.S., it could rack up as many users in the first year as Apple Pay did in two, Crone says.\n\nSome banks are lining up behind a product completely different from a wallet. On Feb. 4, Visa announced software being tested by undisclosed clients that feeds card data to all apps on a consumer's device and directs consumers to the issuer bank in case of a problem. \"This puts the banks more firmly into their roles as the trusted third party in payments,\" says Jim McCarthy, an executive vice president at Visa. \"People won't think about whether it's Apple or Samsung or Google. Over time it will become the card again.\"\n\nThat may be wishful thinking. \"Being able to provide a fully branded experience in the digital world will probably be unrealistic,\" says Celent's Bareisis. \"The world will be more fragmented.\" Wells Fargo is embracing that notion: Beginning in the second quarter, account holders will be able to use Android Pay, as well as plastic, to withdraw money at thousands of its ATMs. \"The convenience means that customers are going to get value out of the fact that they have a card with Wells Fargo,\" says Brett Pitts, head of digital at the bank.\n\nThe bottom line: Banks are playing catch-up to Apple Pay's digital wallet, which could have 25 million active users in the U.S. by yearend.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone. Apple says that would mean writing a whole new operating system that would then be in danger of being tweaked to crack into other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.)\n\nApple's position is really unique for this fight. On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself. Though he also doesn't discount the possibility that the National Security Agency probably could crack into the iPhone, too, but that's not what this case is about.\n\n(As a note, there's a lot we don't know about how exactly security technology works inside the iPhones, especially when comparing new ones to older ones like the 5c in this case. So experts disagree about the government's true technical capacity.)\n\n\"This is in many ways more about legal strategy than what's actually on the phone,\" Soghoian says.\n\nAnd that's a sentiment shared across the industry.\n\n\"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake,\" Jan Koum, CEO of encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, has written in a Facebook post. (Facebook owns WhatsApp.)\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, too, posted on Twitter that he was aware of the challenges that law enforcement agencies face in protecting the public and companies cooperate based on valid legal orders, but \"that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nMicrosoft's executives haven't issued statements of their own, but shared a comment posted by the Reform Government Surveillance coalition (AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo):\n\n\"Reform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information.\"\n\n\"The real linchpin here is not the details of differences between iOS and Android, but they're being forced to produce a new version of software,\" says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nIn that sense, the case is being watched by any company whose customers' data privacy depends on their security software updates, which is a unique universe of encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal but also software makers like Apple and Google.\n\n\"Everyone is carefully watching this because if the government gets what they want here, they'll have the power to conscript tech companies to covertly deliver surveillance software,\" Soghoian says.", "Volunteer your time, sign up to answer phones during our spring fundraiser\n\nIt's hard to overstate the tech world's fascination with the legal standoff between the FBI and Apple. Laymen might look at the dispute and shrug; after all, the FBI is just asking Apple to help hack into one phone, and it's not unusual for tech companies to help the police.\n\n\"Apple does provide 'reasonable assistance' to law enforcement all the time,\" says Jeff Fischbach, a forensic technologist who specializes in retrieving data from devices for use in court. But he says what the FBI is demanding from Apple in the San Bernardino case is qualitatively different.\n\n(For those who haven't been following the case: The FBI wants Apple to write custom software that would make it easier to hack into a locked iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in San Bernardino in December.)\n\n\"I'm not convinced that the FBI has actually pulled out all the stops on this particular phone,\" Fischbach wrote in an email to NPR. \"The concerns they cited exist in any iPhone [forensic] exam, and yet this time they've seemingly declared their hands tied. It feels opportunistic. Like a chance to expand their tool chest.\"\n\nMany tech experts suspect the federal government is taking advantage of the public sentiment surrounding the San Bernardino massacre to force Apple into accepting the premise that it's obliged to aid law enforcement even if it means creating new security weaknesses in the devices it sells.\n\nBut if that is the FBI's strategy, it's not necessarily a winning one. In his New York Times technology column, Farhad Manjoo concluded that the tech industry holds an ace: \"the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible.\"\n\nIt's true that companies such as Apple are usually a step ahead of law enforcement, technologically. Every new generation of device or operating system represents a challenge for the in-house hackers at the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It can take months for them to find a way into a new system, if they can find a way at all. And if the FBI succeeds in forcing Apple to write code to help hack this iPhone 5c, it's presumed the company will engineer the next generation of iPhones to be immune.\n\nBut the government is also holding an ace: the possibility of legislation.\n\nRobert Cattanach is an attorney specializing in cybersecurity who previously worked for the Justice Department. He predicts this fight will eventually go beyond the courts.\n\n\"Whoever is the loser in this will certainly plead their case to Congress,\" he says. \"Either, 'We need a backdoor,' if the FBI loses, or 'You can't give them a backdoor,' if Apple loses.\"\n\nThe question of whether tech companies should be required to build backdoors has been floating around Congress for a number of years now, pushed on one side by law enforcement's growing complaints about how encrypted technology is \"going dark\" to legitimate surveillance and detective work; and opposed on the other side by Silicon Valley. As is the case with so many pressing issues in Congress, nothing much has moved so far, but a public fight over San Bernardino could break the logjam.\n\nFor Fischbach, this is a worrisome possibility, because he thinks the emotions tied up in the San Bernardino case might cause Congress to take the side of the FBI.\n\nIt wouldn't be the end of encryption, he says, but it could be the end of easy-to-get encryption for the general public.\n\n\"[M]andating back doors only pushes the fringe,\" Fischbach writes. People in the know -- such as sophisticated crime syndicates or terror networks -- will still figure out how to keep data unreadable, but \"[f]or the rest of us with 'nothing to hide,' that just means we lose another piece of our privacy.\"", "Apple challenges government encryption demands alone for now\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Although many tech companies have voiced concerns over assisting in government surveillance, Apple is facing the latest battle alone.\n\nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have been conspicuously silent after a U.S. magistrate ordered Apple help investigators hack into an iPhone used by a mass shooter. A few trade groups that count those companies as members issued brief statements of concern about efforts to weaken encryption.

Having never valued Alphabet on this blog, though I have valued it in my classes multiple times, its earnings report is a good time to initiate the process with a valuation.\n\nThe Apple Rollercoaster\n\nApple's most recent earnings report came out on January 26, 2016, and it contained mixed news. On the good news front, Apple announced the largest quarterly earnings in corporate history and higher earnings per share than expected by analysts. The bad news was that these earnings were generated on revenues that were close to flat for the year, that iPhone sales were lower than expected and that the management expected revenues to stay weak through next quarter (in its guidance). The market's reaction was negative, with Apple's stock declining by 6.57%, a drop in market capitalization of more than $30 billion, right after the announcement.\n\nIn the picture below, I capture the pricing reaction to Apple, with its earnings history as background information:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nIn summary, it looks like the market is weighing the iPhone and guidance bad news far more than the earnings good news in making its assessment, with Apple's history of beating earnings every quarter for the last eight weighing against it.\n\nTo evaluate whether the earnings report merited the negative market reaction, I went back to the intrinsic value drawing board and updated my valuation of Apple, the last of which I posted in August 2015 and subsequently updated in November 2015, after its annual report (with a September 2015 year end) came out. My assessment of Apple's value in November of 2015 was $134/share, but more importantly, the narrative that I had for Apple was that of a slow-growth , cash rich company (revenue growth rate of 3% in the next five years and a cash balance of $200 billion), with operating margins under pressure (declining from the 32.03% it earned as a pre-tax operating margin in the 2015 fiscal year to 25% over the next decade) and a very low probability of a difference-making disruption.\n\nLooking at the earnings report, it is true that revenue growth came in below expectations (but not by much, given my low expectations) and operating margins dropped, again in line with expectations.\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nThe net effect is that my narrative changed little, and using a slightly lower revenue growth rate (2.2% instead of 3%) leads me to an updated assessment of value per share of $126 in February 2016 and almost all of the difference is coming from a repricing of risk (higher equity risk premiums and default spreads in the market).\n\nIn keeping with my view that estimated value is a distribution, not a single number, I ran a simulation on Apple's value in February 2016:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nAt the price of $94 at close of trading on February 12, 2016, Apple looks under valued by about 25% and at least based on my distribution, there is a more than 90% chance that it is under valued.\n\nAlphabet Soup\n\nAlphabet surprised markets on February 1, 2016, with on earnings report where the company reported higher revenue growth than anticipated, coupled with higher profit margins. Since it was also the first report that the company was releasing as holding company, where it was breaking itself down by business, there was also excitement about what you would learn about the company from this report.\n\nAs with Apple, I start by looking at the pricing effect of the earnings report, comparing, actual numbers to expectations and tallying the stock price reaction to the report:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nMarkets were impressed by both the revenue and earnings numbers and the stock price increased by 8% in the immediate aftermath, briefly leading Alphabet to the front of the market cap race.\n\nAs a counter to the market's excitement, I decided to compare the narrative (and value) that I had for Alphabet in November 2015 (after their last earnings report) to the narrative (and value) after this one (in February 2016). In November 2015, my narrative for Google was that it would continue to be a dominant and profitable player in a growing online advertising market, growing 12% a year in the near term, maintaining its operating margins (left at 30% in pre-tax terms, in perpetuity).\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nIt is true that in their most recent earnings report, Alphabet reported double-digit growth in revenues (impressive given their size and the state of the global economy) and higher operating margins than they did in the previous quarter. I left my original narrative largely intact, with revenue growth remaining at 12% and pushed up the target pre-tax operating margin to 32%, and arrived at a value per share of $631/share.Presenting Google's value as a distribution, here is what I get:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nAt $682.40, the price at which the class C shares were trading at on February 12, 2016, the stock is trading at about 8% above the median price, with a 35% chance of being under valued. Since these shares have no voting rights, attaching a value to voting rights, will make the shares a little more over priced.\n\nI know that one reason for Google's restructuring/renaming exercise last year was an ostensible desire to improve transparency, but I think that there may be less here than promised, at least at the moment. There were a few things that became transparent in Google's last earnings release, as captured in this picture of a key part of the earnings release from the company:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nTransparency is good for investors, but with Alphabet, I will reserve my cheers until I see real evidence of it (and perhaps I will, in the full 10Q).\n\nApple vs Alphabet\n\nIf this were a boxing match, Apple and Alphabet would be the super heavyweights, fighting it out for the world championship. To judge which is the better company, though, you would have to specify on what dimension you are making the comparison, i.e., as a business, an investment or as a trade.\n\nI. As Businesses\n\nApple and Alphabet share a few common features. First, each of them derives their value from one cash cow, the iPhone for Apple and the search engine for Google, that individually have values so large that they would exceed the GDPs of many small countries. Second, both companies are known for their attention to detail and customer focus, at least on their core products, perhaps explaining why they have been so successful over time. Third, both companies have work forces filled with brilliant people who seem to like working for them. In short, these companies are perfect illustrations of how customer focus, employee satisfaction and shareholder value maximization often go hand in hand.\n\nEach company, though, has areas where it has advantages. The Alphabet advantage is that its core product, its search engine, enriched with YouTube and the Google ecosystem, requires less care and maintenance to keep cash flows going, with Facebook perhaps being the only threat in the short or the medium term to profits. In contrast, Apple's iPhone franchise requires the company to constantly reinvent the product and make its own prior models obsolete, creating a two-year cycle that is both expensive and gut wrenching to watch. The Apple advantage, though, comes from its history of having survived a near-death experience (in the late 1990s) and reinvented itself. Consequently, the company is much more aware of how tenuous its hold on value is and it does try harder to find new game changers. There is one final difference that, at least at the moment, is working for Alphabet and against Apple, which is that Apple has made China its biggest foreign bet and Google has little exposure to the Chinese economy, thanks to the Chinese government's fear that all that stands between it and chaos is a good search engine. If I were to pick a better business at the moment, it has to be Google. The company's core is strong and will get stronger and the biggest threat it faces, i.e., that the way we look for things may change from search engines to social media sites, is more distant that the the one faced by Apple.\n\nII. As an Investment\n\nThe quality of an investment does not always correlate with its quality as a business, with the price driving the divergence. Buying a great business at too high a price is a bad investment, just as buying a bad business at a low enough price can be a good investment. Both Apple and Alphabet are good businesses, but as an investor, my money is on Apple, rather than Alphabet, at the prevailing price:\n\nI would hasten to add that I have never owned Google, as an investor, and that may reflect the fact that I continually under estimate the profit-making power of its online advertising engine. So, feel free to download my valuation, change the inputs you don't like and make it your own.\n\nIII. As a Trade\n\nIf momentum is the biggest driver in the pricing game, it is Alphabet that has the advantage right now, notwithstanding the decline in its price in the days since its last earnings report. Whether fair or not, markets have found the good news in almost every Alphabet story and find the storm clouds even on Apple's sunniest days. As long as the momentum game continues, you will make money far more easily and quickly with Alphabet than with Apple, but just a note of warning, from Apple's own recent past. Momentum will change, almost always without any advance warning and for no good fundamental reason, and when it does, I hope that you are able to get ahead of it.", "A fight between privacy advocates and national security experts over data encryption came to a head last week when a federal judge ordered Apple to help federal officials \"unlock\" an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino terrorists.

Iconic art is all over this country, and all these pieces of art have in common the sense of wonder, curiosity and place that they bring to their respective cities. They bring culture and creativity - two elements that help cities thrive and grow. This is what we want to do in Sterling Heights - elevate our sense of place.\"\n\nSo what is public art?\n\n\"As defined by the Association of Public Art, what distinguishes public art is the unique association of how it's made, what it is, and what it means,\" Doyle said. \"Public art can express community values, enhance our environment, transform a landscape, heighten awareness, or question our assumptions. Placed in public sites, this art is there for everyone as a form of collective community expression. Public art is a reflection of how we see the world, the artist's response to our time and place, combined with our own sense of who we are.\"\n\nAccording to Doyle, the Sterling Heights Public Art Program would seek to \"enhance and grow\" the city's public art offerings, which currently includes the \"Sterlingscape\" sculptures located on the city center grounds at Dodge Park and Utica roads, the \"Artist of the Month\" program presented by the Sterling Heights Arts Commission, and the 40-foot Mile Markers that will be placed along Van Dyke at 15 Mile, 16 Mile, 17 Mile and 18 Mile roads in the spring as part of ongoing improvements along the corridor.\n\n\"As you can see, art has an appreciated presence in Sterling Heights, as evidenced by some of our own iconic artwork,\" Doyle said. \"When building our public art program, we will draw off of Michigan's own national leaders in public art. The goal is to tailor the program to Sterling Heights and our community's specific needs, but also draw off the experience and success of other programs in order to incorporate the best from all to create our own comprehensive and successful plan.\"\n\nDoyle noted the program would be similar to those already implemented by larger metropolitan communities, such as Seattle, Dallas, New York City and Chicago, as well as well-known art programs in mid-size cities such as Iowa City, Iowa; Anchorage, Alaska; and Eugene, Ore.\n\n\"Here in Michigan, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo are some of the regional leaders,\" Doyle said. \"In the future, we want Sterling Heights to be a city known for its art outreach. We want to get our public art featured on the MI Art Tours app, which anyone can download through the Apple and Android app stores, to seek and view public art throughout our great state.\n\n\"We want to create a library of our city's artwork, available on our website, so residents and visitors can plan their visits to each piece and learn more about the title and artist. We want to engage the community and support interactive events and campaigns so everyone feels like Sterling Heights' art is their art.\"\n\n\"Overall, we want to be transparent, inclusive and welcoming as a resource for artists and art appreciators from around the region,\" she said.

(AP) -- FBI agents on Thursday searched the California home of the brother of the gunman who killed 14 people in the terror attack in San Bernardino last December, but he was not arrested and has not been named a suspect.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, is a military veteran who earned medals for fighting global terrorism. The search warrant is sealed, and FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller would not disclose any information other than to confirm a search was conducted at a home in the city of Corona in an ongoing investigation.\n\nTo serve a search warrant, authorities must have probable cause a crime was committed and items connected to the crime are likely to be found at the location.\n\nMessages left for attorneys representing the Farook family were not immediately returned.\n\nStacy Mozer, who lives around the corner from the home, said he watched as agents carried away armloads of boxes filled with manila envelopes, a computer tower and stacks of paper. At least a dozen agents were present.\n\nHe described Raheel Farook and wife Tatiana as ideal neighbors. The couple drove another neighbor to doctor's appointments last year when she had cancer surgery, treated her to meals out and fetched her prescriptions for her, even paying for them, he said.\n\nThe couple frequently strolled with their 1-year-old daughter around the community of town homes and took her to the pool.\n\n\"I would find it very hard to believe that they would be involved in any way,\" he said. \"I do know that if you have a family member, you don't have control of their lives, and I don't think they had control of their brother's life.\"\n\nMozer said the family's home was searched twice after the December shooting, and authorities broke down the door on an earlier occasion.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Dec. 2 at a meeting of his San Bernardino County co-workers. They died hours later in a shootout with police. The 14 people killed marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nFarook's family has said it had no inkling about the plot.\n\nRaheel Farook was in the Navy from 2003 to 2007, military records show. He was stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and received the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards.\n\nThe chief of the FBI's Los Angeles field office told The Associated Press last month that some of the most basic questions related to the shootings had not been answered, including whether anyone else was involved. At the time, David Bowdich said investigators were not looking past anyone and had \"a very open mind on this investigation.\"\n\nThe search of the Farook home came a day after Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would fight federal government efforts to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the gunman.\n\nSo far, the only person charged in connection with the attack is Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor of Rizwan Farook's. Marquez is charged with providing the assault rifles used in the massacre, making false statements about when he bought the weapons and conspiring with Rizwan Farook on a pair of previously planned attacks that were never carried out.\n\nMarquez also faces charges of marriage fraud and lying on immigration paperwork. The FBI said he acknowledged that he was paid $200 a month to marry the sister of Raheel Farook's wife, and he lied on immigration papers that he lived with her so she could stay in the U.S.\n\nMarquez and his wife listed their address at the same Corona home that was searched by the FBI on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMyers reported from Los Angeles.

The feds seek information such as the contact list and text messages that are locked behind a password in the phone. That information could help in their investigation of Syed Rizwan Farook.\n\nAt first glance, a no-brainer, right? What company wouldn't want to grab a starring role in \"To Catch A Terrorist\"?\n\nBut Apple chief Tim Cook refuses. He says the government's request would force Apple to build a \"back door\" key to its operating system that could then be exploited by criminals and hackers around the world. He argues that the damage to users' privacy -- all the sensitive personal information on their phones -- far outweighs the benefit to law enforcement in this case.\n\nEarlier this week, a federal magistrate ordered Apple to cooperate with the FBI. The company says it will appeal.\n\nYou'll be hearing a lot more about this as it moves up the legal food chain toward the Supreme Court. Everyone with a computer or a smartphone has a stake in how this plays out.\n\nObvious Question: Is Apple siding with terrorists?\n\nObvious Answer: Not at all.\n\nFarook had backed up his data to the cloud until about six weeks before the attack. Apple has turned over that data to the FBI.\n\nBut there's still more information on his phone. The FBI wants Apple to help disable a password-protection feature that would wipe the phone's data after someone makes 10 unsuccessful password attempts. The feds want the ability to make tens of millions of guesses at Farook's password, presumably guessing right eventually.\n\nApple claims that to comply with the FBI, the company would need to create a sweeping software program that could be used on other devices, imperiling other users' security. The feds, in contrast, say they seek a narrowly tailored tool to unlock a single phone.\n\nWe won't wander into those deep electronic weeds. Suffice to say, we imagine judges will be hearing plenty of evidence from computerati about why Apple's technical argument is right ... or wrong.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the larger issue here. Apple and other tech companies have created highly secure systems for a compelling reason: to thwart hacking attempts by criminals, terrorists and saboteurs who continually probe for weaknesses in computer systems.\n\nWe're glad that on the newer iPhones, even Apple can't break into its own system: If there's a back door created for law enforcement, you can be sure that someone will find the key under the mat or the flowerpot.\n\nCyberwar is a mounting threat. The U.S. government is defending against the possible electronic sabotage of this country's power grid and transportation systems. Hackers routinely ransack banks, retail chains and other firms, stealing credit card data, personnel files, trade secrets.\n\nNo company would relish casting itself in the role of denying a government request to help thwart terrorists. It's not hard to imagine how some customers won't understand, won't agree and will shun Apple products.\n\nBut customers depend on companies like Apple to stay one step ahead of hackers. If Apple writes software to defeat its sophisticated encryption systems, its customers will think twice. And its competitors -- many of whom develop their apps and systems in foreign countries beyond the reach of U.S. law -- will leverage that information to create ever more bulletproof systems. Why bother? To gain a competitive advantage against Apple.\n\n\"We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI and we believe their intentions are good,\" Cook wrote in an open letter. So do we.\n\nThat said, we also believe Apple is well-equipped to judge the dangers of creating this sort of vulnerability in its security systems. Unless a tech genius devises a brilliant alternative to resolve this conflict without risking that security, Apple should stand its ground.\n\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone. Apple says that would mean writing a whole new operating system that would then be in danger of being tweaked to crack into other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.)\n\nApple's position is really unique for this fight. On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself. Though he also doesn't discount the possibility that the National Security Agency probably could crack into the iPhone, too, but that's not what this case is about.\n\n(As a note, there's a lot we don't know about how exactly security technology works inside the iPhones, especially when comparing new ones to older ones like the 5c in this case. So experts disagree about the government's true technical capacity.)\n\n\"This is in many ways more about legal strategy than what's actually on the phone,\" Soghoian says.\n\nAnd that's a sentiment shared across the industry.\n\n\"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake,\" Jan Koum, CEO of encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, has written in a Facebook post. (Facebook owns WhatsApp.)\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, too, posted on Twitter that he was aware of the challenges that law enforcement agencies face in protecting the public and companies cooperate based on valid legal orders, but \"that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nMicrosoft's executives haven't issued statements of their own, but shared a comment posted by the Reform Government Surveillance coalition (AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo):\n\n\"Reform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information.\"\n\n\"The real linchpin here is not the details of differences between iOS and Android, but they're being forced to produce a new version of software,\" says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nIn that sense, the case is being watched by any company whose customers' data privacy depends on their security software updates, which is a unique universe of encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal but also software makers like Apple and Google.\n\n\"Everyone is carefully watching this because if the government gets what they want here, they'll have the power to conscript tech companies to covertly deliver surveillance software,\" Soghoian says.", "In the pursuit of the presidency, candidates are focused on upcoming votes in Nevada and South Carolina. But a string of primaries and caucuses immediately following could be a big challenge for Bernie Sanders' campaign.\n\nMost polls suggest that after Nevada and South Carolina, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will have roughly the same number of pledged delegates. We took a look at the primary map with political scientist Eric Davis to find out how-- if polls don't change-- Sanders forges a path forward.\n\nReporter Alex Apple: Eric, we're going to take a look at what's coming up on the Democratic calendar and the Democratic primaries. So far, in Iowa and New Hampshire, Clinton and Sanders are one and one. Secretary Clinton took Iowa. We'll give her a light blue color on our map here. Bernie Sanders took New Hampshire, we'll give him a darker color. South Carolina and Nevada are next up and polls show Nevada is a tossup. For the sake of our explanation here, we'll give it to Senator Sanders, it will probably be narrowly. Polls show that Clinton is likely headed to victory in South Carolina. At this point, after four races, is the race changed in any way at that point?\n\nEric Davis: The Democrats use proportional allocation to distribute the delegates between the candidates in every state. So as long as Clinton and Sanders are finishing pretty close to each other in all of these states, neither of them is going to have a big lead in terms of delegates over the other.\n\nAlex Apple: And so after Nevada and South Carolina, 11 states vote on Super Tuesday, that's March first. They're highlighted in yellow currently. Let's go ahead and turn the three that Sanders is likely to win. He takes Vermont and he also takes Massachusetts, the cluster up top. And it's going to be close in Minnesota, but we'll give it to him for this scenario. Now let's go ahead and highlight the eight states where Hillary Clinton is currently polling ahead. She runs up big wins in the South, a lot of light blue. And if Sanders cannot cut into that lead in the South, how do you see the race shaping up at that point?\n\nEric Davis: Well, at this point, it really is a contest for delegates, it's not a contest for states, because proportional representation is used to allocate all of these delegates. So if Sanders, for example, can get to 45 percent in a state like Virginia and win nearly half of the delegates in that state, he's doing well.\n\nAlex Apple: So it's not almost over at this point.\n\nEric Davis: It's not almost over by any means. Another thing is that almost all the states in the South are the ones that will go Republican in November. So these aren't the sorts of states a Democrat needs to be focused on in order to be elected president.\n\nAlex Apple: By our count, after Super Tuesday that could be 10 wins for Secretary Clinton, five for Bernie Sanders. We asked him about cutting into Secretary Clinton's lead with African-Americans. He knows he has to expand that coalition.\n\n----\n\nAlex Apple: People talk about you need to expand your coalition to include African-Americans and Latinos. Are you sure that you can do that?\n\nBernie Sanders: Well, we are doing our best to do that. We have a great crew of people both in Nevada and South Carolina, very strongly staffed by Latinos and African-Americans. And I think, I think the message is resonating.\n\nPolls can always change before a vote. Usually that comes if a candidate pulls an upset or drastically swings momentum in their favor. That's when polls are most likely to change.", "(Photo: Michael Appleton for the Mayoral Photography Office)\n\nMayor Bill de Blaisio makes a call on a new LinkNYC kiosk.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio today rolled out the first of the city's snazzy new LinkNYC kiosks, which will let New Yorkers connect to wifi, charge their phones, and make calls -- and which officials promised would also protect the privacy of people who use it.\n\n\"Privacy is very important to us,\" Colin O'Donnell, the chief innovation officer at Intersection, the company powering the kiosks, said today at a press conference beside one of them on Third Avenue. \"We worked with the mayor's office to create what we think is the most user-centric privacy policy of any public wifi network. It will never share your email address or any personally identifiable information with any third-party -- period.\"\n\nWell, with one exception: the police. If you use the wifi network in the commission of a crime, your data may be handed over to the NYPD.\n\n\"There would be a process, as always, for any public safety agency to get such information, but we're ready to follow through with that,\" Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nThat process has been in the spotlight this week, after a judge ordered Apple to help law enforcement authorities gather information from the iPhone of the man accused of leading an ISIS-inspired shooting spree in San Bernardino, California -- something Apple is challenging.\n\n\"From a technical standpoint, if we are asked by the police department and a subpoena is issued, we'll give up the information,\" Scott Goldsmith, president of media at Intersection, said. \"We are not going to challenge the New York City police department if they ask us for information that we are legally required to give to them.\"\n\nThe data created by the wifi kiosks, will not be owned by the city, but instead by CityBridge, a consortium of companies including Intersection that are installing the kiosks where phone booths once stood, in a franchise agreement with the city. That means your browsing history won't be accessible to reporters or other rabble-rousers through Freedom of Information Law requests, according to the mayor's counsel Maya Wiley said.\n\n\"The city will only have anonymized data -- we will not have any personally identifiable data on anyone using the systems,\" Ms. Wiley said.\n\nBut some of that anonymized data will be made public, Mr. O'Donnell said.\n\n\"We will not share any personally identifiable information -- that means your name, email address, any identifiable information about you,\" he said. \"We do recognize there's an opportunity to create aggregate, anonymized data that we can use to create better policies, better understand broadband utilization across the city. And that aggregate anonymous data we will shared with the city, to be shared through the city open data platform.\"\n\nWhile Mr. O'Donnell promised e-mails and other personal information wouldn't be shared by Intersection, it's worth noting that accessing a wifi hotspot can reveal more than just the email you use to sign up for it. As a group of artists recently illustrated, cell phones with wifi enabled are constantly shouting out each mobile users most frequently visited places.\n\nAnd for the very security conscious, even anonymized data can be an issue: with three basic data points, plenty of third parties who are interested in the data Intersection is collecting could easily determine an internet user's identity.\n\nMr. O'Donnell said they'd urge users to adopt \"common internet hygiene practices\" -- like ensuring you're using an SSL connection for things like banking. For those with an iPhone using iOS7 and up, the kiosks will offer an encrypted network.\n\nMr. de Blasio demonstrated the kiosk by using it to make a phone call to 311 -- where he asked the operator for information about his proudest accomplishment, universal pre-kindergarten -- but he didn't hook up to the wifi network. That is perhaps unsurprising, because he is notably attached to his years-old flip phone.\n\n\"That phone is strong and resilient,\" Mr. de Blasio offered as a defense of his Luddite tendencies.\n\nMr. de Blasio said he didn't plan on trading that phone in, nor did he carry around any other high-tech devices that he'd use to access the wifi.\n\n\"Just a Blackberry and my old reliable flip phone,\" Mr. de Blasio said. \"But everyone else in my family would benefit a lot from it.\"", "By now many of you guys have probably read about the huge debate about whether or not Apple should comply with the court's request to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Many have since sided with Apple, claiming that there is a difference between complying with a valid request, versus installing a backdoor for law enforcement officials.\n\nNow whether or not Apple will eventually comply or be forced to comply remains to be seen, but in the meantime John McAfee has recently stepped forward and offered his services to decrypt the iPhone. In an editorial published by Tech Insider, McAfee claims that he and his team will be able to decrypt the iPhone in as short as three weeks.\n\nThis isn't so much that McAfee believes that what the government is demanding from Apple is right, but rather he thinks that if he can decrypt it, then there would be no need for Apple to have to create backdoors for law enforcement officials to access in the future. McAfee writes, \"If the government succeeds in getting this back door, it will eventually get a back door into all encryption, and our world, as we know it, is over.\"\n\nHe adds, \"In spite of the FBI's claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that's impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government.\" McAfee claims that the reason he thinks he will be able to break into the iPhone is because he works with people that the government might not typically employ.\n\nMcAfee says, \"And why do the best hackers on the planet not work for the FBI? Because the FBI will not hire anyone with a 24-inch purple mohawk, 10-gauge ear piercings, and a tattooed face who demands to smoke weed while working and won't work for less than a half-million dollars a year.\" To that end, he also said that if he does not succeed in decrypting the iPhone, he will eat his shoe live on the Neil Cavuto show.", "Shooting rampage: Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings. -- Reuters\n\nA court order demanding that Apple Inc help the US government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle.\n\nBut the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathised with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide.\n\nA federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance\" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings.\n\nThe government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put \"backdoors\" in their products.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook has said was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was \"narrowly tailored,\" and chided Apple. \"It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on US soil.\"\n\nMost technology security experts, including many who have served in government, have said technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes.\n\n\"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,\" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\"\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai endorsed Cook's stance in tweets on Wednesday.\n\n\"We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders,\" he wrote. \"But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nLegal fight\n\nRepresentatives of several tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government's position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department.\n\nThe industry was \"committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe,\" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, \"the government's position is overbroad and unwise.\"\n\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association said if the order was carried out, \"it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit.\"\n\nIf the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. \"The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,\" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues.\n\nFarook was assigned the phone by the county health department for which he worked, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had \"given its consent\" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said.\n\nSan Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families.\n\n\"They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats? Were there other individuals involved?\" Ramos said in a telephone interview.\n\nMaster key\n\nDan Guido, an expert in hacking operating systems, said that to unlock the phone, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would need to install an update to Apple's iOS operating system so investigators could circumvent the security protections, including one that wipes data if an incorrect password is entered too many times.\n\nHe said only Apple could provide that software because the phones will only install updates that are digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key.\n\n\"That key is one of the most valuable pieces of data the entire company owns,\" he said. \"Someone with that key can change all the data on all the iPhones.\"\n\nThe notion of providing that key is anathema to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group. \"Once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nLance James, an expert in forensics who is chief scientist with cyber intelligence company Flashpoint, said Apple could respond to the order without providing crypto keys or specialized tools that could be used to unlock other phones.\n\nApple technicians could create software that would unlock the phone, allowing the company to create a backup file with all of its contents that they could provide to law enforcement, James said.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Alex Abdo said the government's request risked a \"dangerous\" precedent. \"The Constitution does not permit the government to force companies to hack into their customers' devices,\" he said.\n\nApple was a topic of discussion on the presidential campaign trail on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, front-runner for the Republican Party's nomination to run in the Nov. 8 election, said on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, \"I agree 100% with the courts. In that case, we should open it (the iPhone) up ... We have to use common sense.\"\n\nAnother Republican candidate, US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, called it a \"tough issue\" that would require government to work closely with the tech industry to find a solution. Rubio said he hoped Apple would voluntarily comply with the court order. -- Reuters", "BEIJING: Apple Inc launched its mobile payment system in China in a bid to convince the hundreds of millions of users of the country's entrenched, dominant services to switch.\n\n\"We think China could be our largest Apple Pay market,\" Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing.\n\nIn an early boost, China's biggest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), was among the banks that said earlier this week that customers would be able to use Apple Pay from Thursday.\n\nHowever, Apple Pay has not had an easy ride so far in China, the fifth country to get the service. Even in its US home market, Apple has faced sceptical retailers in its effort to develop a new revenue stream.\n\nChina is not likely to prove any easier to crack.\n\n\"People switch applications for significantly better experiences, it (Apple) has to deliver not just a little bit more secure, or a little bit easier to use,\" said Mark Natkin, founder of Marbridge Consulting.\n\nGreater China is Apple's second-largest market by revenue, and the world's biggest smartphone market. By the end of 2015, 358 million people, more than the US population, had already taken to buying goods and services by mobile phone, according to the China Internet Network Information Center.\n\nThe vast majority are using payment services from China's two biggest Internet companies that have existed for years.\n\nSocial networking and gaming firm Tencent Holdings Ltd operates WeChat Payment, and e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, through its Internet finance affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, runs Alipay.\n\n\"With 100% saturation of local payment systems, no one in China is clamouring for Apple Pay,\" said one retailer who declined to be named for fear of harming business prospects. \"Today, everyone has a local payment option on their phone, so Apple Pay is a solution in need of a problem.\"\n\nBanks on board\n\nDeeply ingrained in China's Internet, domestic payment services cover much more than ride hailing, food delivery and online shopping. Users can invest in wealth management funds, pay utility bills, send gifts to friends and give to charity.\n\nAn Ant Financial spokeswoman said Alipay has over 400 million active users, with 80% on mobile.\n\n\"Alipay is an app for both (Google software) Android and (Apple's) iOS system and has little requirements for the make and model of the mobile phone,\" she said.\n\nThe US firm has 19 of China's biggest lenders as partners. That means 80% of China's credit and debit cards are eligible for Apple Pay, usable at about one-third of all locations that accept those cards, Apple's Bailey said.\n\nApple's approach is to not compete with banks and UnionPay, said Bailey.\n\n\"China UnionPay and our Apple Pay solution has a huge advantage, given the footprint of China UnionPay,\" she said. \"Its merchant acceptance network far exceeds what any of the other mobile platforms have today.\"\n\nThough banks have been rivals elsewhere, industry watchers say this tactic may offer Apple its best prospect.\n\nZhao Longkai, associate professor of finance at the Peking University Guanghua School of Management, said China's banks, and state-backed payment card monopoly China UnionPay, have rankled at the popularity of alternative mobile systems associated with Alibaba and Tencent.\n\n\"The entry of Apple Pay has the potential to change the strategic landscape,\" said Zhao. \"UnionPay now has an opportunity to bring a new alliance to defend the market that it is losing to Tencent or Alibaba - Apple Pay first needs to figure out a way to win over Chinese customers.\" -- Reuters", "It's hard to overstate the tech world's fascination with the legal standoff between the FBI and Apple.

In his New York Times technology column, Farhad Manjoo concluded that the tech industry holds an ace: \"the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible.\"\n\nIt's true that companies such as Apple are usually a step ahead of law enforcement, technologically. Every new generation of device or operating system represents a challenge for the in-house hackers at the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It can take months for them to find a way into a new system, if they can find a way at all. And if the FBI succeeds in forcing Apple to write code to help hack this iPhone 5c, it's presumed the company will engineer the next generation of iPhones to be immune.\n\nBut the government is also holding an ace: the possibility of legislation.\n\nRobert Cattanach is an attorney specializing in cybersecurity who previously worked for the Justice Department. He predicts this fight will eventually go beyond the courts.\n\n\"Whoever is the loser in this will certainly plead their case to Congress,\" he says. \"Either, 'We need a backdoor,' if the FBI loses, or 'You can't give them a backdoor,' if Apple loses.\"\n\nThe question of whether tech companies should be required to build backdoors has been floating around Congress for a number of years now, pushed on one side by law enforcement's growing complaints about how encrypted technology is \"going dark\" to legitimate surveillance and detective work; and opposed on the other side by Silicon Valley. As is the case with so many pressing issues in Congress, nothing much has moved so far, but a public fight over San Bernardino could break the logjam.\n\nFor Fischbach, this is a worrisome possibility, because he thinks the emotions tied up in the San Bernardino case might cause Congress to take the side of the FBI.\n\nIt wouldn't be the end of encryption, he says, but it could be the end of easy-to-get encryption for the general public.\n\n\"[M]andating back doors only pushes the fringe,\" Fischbach writes. People in the know -- such as sophisticated crime syndicates or terror networks -- will still figure out how to keep data unreadable, but \"[f]or the rest of us with 'nothing to hide,' that just means we lose another piece of our privacy.\"", "The showdown between the FBI and Apple could result in huge changes for security and privacy, but one thing it may not do is deliver a big break in the San Bernardino case.\n\nInvestigators say they want to exhaust every avenue as they piece together what led to the Dec. 2 attack. That's why they've asked a court to order Apple to unlock an iPhone that belonged to Syed Farook, one of the shooters. Apple is refusing to cooperate.\n\nBeyond the larger battle of principle, however, skeptics wonder whether the FBI can learn much of value from Farook's phone.\n\n\"We have to ask ourselves what they'll discover on the San Bernardino shooter's phone that they don't already have,\" said Susan Landau, a professor of Cybersecurity Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\n\n\"They should already have the information on whom he called, and who called him; they can get that information from the metadata at the phone company,\" she said. \"In the same way, they can get some of the email data from his Internet service provider. So what they are really looking for is anything Farook might have saved on his phone -- and you have to wonder what the value will be of that.\"\n\nInvestigators are concerned that Farook allegedly turned off the iCloud backup for the phone about a month before the attacks. That leads them to suspect Farook might have something saved on the phone itself that could provide clues about other people who might have been involved or help authorities pin down the precise motive or triggering event for the shooting.\n\nFor skeptics and privacy advocates, the focus on the phone feels a little misguided. The FBI has already been able to follow a fulsome digital trail on computers and social media that has helped investigators piece together what happened.\n\nWhat's more, although Farook and his wife were killed in a police shootout, the FBI has arrested a man who not only bought the weapons used in the attack, but also provided a long narrative about Farook and his radicalization.\n\nEven so, government officials want as much information they can get.\n\n\"There is a deep-seated law enforcement mentality of wanting everything in an investigation, irrespective of its relevance or whether the information duplicates data available somewhere else,\" said Fred Cate, vice president for Research at Indiana University and a senior fellow of its Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. \"You can easily understand where this comes from, but in an increasingly digital world, it is unworkable.\"\n\nFBI officials concede that Farook's phone may be an investigative dead end, but they feel pressure to follow every lead they can. The Justice Department said as much in a statement released Wednesday by Eileen Decker, the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.\n\n\"We have made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible,\" she said. \"These victims and families deserve nothing less.\"\n\nTop national security and law enforcement officials have spent years warning about the dangers of encryption. FBI Director James Comey has said enhanced security on cellphones and other devices blunts the bureau's ability to find terrorists before they strike or to prosecute them if they are caught.\n\nCIA Director John Brennan has said terrorists use encrypted technology to \"make it exceptionally difficult, both technically, as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it.\"\n\nBoth men worry aloud that encryption of the kind on Apple's new phones will turn otherwise solvable cases into cold ones. They've also warned about encrypted communications apps and social networks, which they argue enable terrorists to operate outside the view of the agencies charged with stopping their attacks.\n\nThe Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University released a report earlier this month to look at whether cellphone encryption is as crucial to an investigation as authorities claim. The report, titled \"Don't Panic: Making Progress on the 'Going Dark' Debate\" was written by a diverse group that included former leaders at the National Counterterrorism Center like Matthew Olsen and denizens of the cyber world like Bruce Schneier.\n\nWhile the report's authors couldn't agree on the best balance between privacy and security, it conceded that they could see how \"conducting certain types of surveillance has, to some extent, become more difficult.\" But, at the same time it questioned \"whether the 'going dark' metaphor accurately describes the state of affairs. Are we really headed to a future in which our ability to effectively surveil criminals and bad actors is impossible? We think not.\"\n\nWorcester Polytechnic's Landau, who helped author the report, said it's easy to appreciate why the FBI is trying to corral as much information as it can in the San Bernardino case.\n\n\"I do understand that this and every investigation requires due diligence,\" she said. \"But at this point it is unlikely, even if the Farook phone is opened, that the FBI is going to get much new information from doing this.\"\n\nBut Stewart Baker, former general counsel at the National Security Agency and a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security, says that for today's investigations, cellphone data is still a cornerstone of process.\n\n\"I think that the argument that you can get a lot of information elsewhere to solve crimes so you don't have to worry about encrypted cellphones is disingenuous,\" Baker said.\n\n\"Sure, sometimes that will be true,\" he said. \"There will be crimes that can be solved that way that might not be solved otherwise and that might be a good response on average. It might be enough on average. But if you look at something like San Bernardino, that's a crime about which we need to know as much as we can -- and whatever might be hiding on that cellphone is part of that.\"", "At a time when Apple is going to war against the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure order, the Supreme Court of Canada will hear Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal against the long arm of B.C.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courts.\n\nIn a case that has garnered international attention, the Internet giant is fighting a rare worldwide injunction issued by the B.C. Supreme Court and endorsed by the B.C.

Supreme Court Justice Laura Ann Fenlon issued the extraordinary extra-territorial order on June 13, 2014 and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling last June.\n\nThe province\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top court said the judge had territorial competence over Google because the company does business here and she possessed an inherent jurisdiction to maintain the rule of law and protect the integrity of proceedings.\n\nThe power to grant injunctions is presumptively unlimited, injunctions aimed at maintaining order need not be directed solely at the parties involved in litigation and, in this case, one with worldwide effect was justified, the appellate bench added.\n\nFor civil libertarians and those interested in web freedom, the key worry is that if Canada endorses this kind of approach, countries with more repressive views or more malleable courts will abuse it.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen various jurisdictions trying to do this.\n\nThe French in 2000 slapped Yahoo! for selling Nazi memorabilia.\n\nYahoo! tried to litigate the case in the U.S. but the Ninth Circuit ruled in 2004 that the company hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t established the French had done anything wrong to give a domestic court jurisdiction to strike down their decision.\n\nIn 2006, the French court reversed the ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down the case.\n\nIn 2014, the European Court of Justice demanded the delisting of nasty personal links for people in a Spanish Google case dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right to be forgotten\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe repercussions of that are still being resolved because there is a chasm between European views of protecting feelings and the American free-speech free-for-all.\n\nThere are major problems with injunctions for reasons that are less black-and-white and engage complex constitutional rights rather than simple commercial interests.\n\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a global sheriff because countries have different domestic laws and cultural approaches toward free speech, privacy and political satire.\n\nThis order may not offend anybody, what about the next one?\n\nAnd questions about whether U.S. courts will respect such injunctions and apply sanctions remain open.\n\nStill, although the Canadian Supreme Court probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rule until next year, I expect it to endorse such injunctions as the way of the future.", "It's hard to overstate the tech world's fascination with the legal standoff between the FBI and Apple.

This while the company is dramatically shrinking to appease restless shareholders threatening to overthrow management unless things get better.\n\nJust before Mayer's appearance, Yahoo tried to underscore its long-term commitment to mobile by projecting this statement on a huge screen hanging above the stage: \"Imagine what the next seven years will bring.\"\n\nIt's not even clear that Yahoo will exist in its current form seven months from now, given that some of its shareholders want the company to sell its Internet operations after 3 1/2 years of declining revenue under Mayer's leadership. Mayer and the rest of Yahoo's board is exploring \"strategic alternatives\" that could include a sale while the Sunnyvale, California, company sheds 15 percent of its workforce and closes unprofitable services.\n\nEven though she is deviating from an original turnaround plan, Mayer has steadfastly insisted that Yahoo Inc. will still have a bright future after her latest overhaul.\n\nMayer touched upon that theme Thursday as she emphasized that Yahoo is still investing heavily in mobile devices despite the massive cutbacks in other areas of the company.\n\n\"There is incredible potential here,\" she assured the mobile developers. \"Together, we can build the future of mobile.\"\n\nUnlike her appearance at Yahoo's inaugural mobile conference last year, Mayer gave a brief presentation before leaving most of the talking to executives that joined her management team after the company bought mobile analytics service Flurry for $270 million in 2014. In another departure from last year, Mayer didn't hold a news conference after her onstage appearance, allowing her to avoid further questions about Yahoo's fate.\n\nMayer's job security is shaky because Yahoo's stock has sunk by more than 40 percent since the end of 2014, reflecting Wall Street's frustration with her inability to deliver on her promise to revive Yahoo's revenue growth. The company's revenue, after subtracting ad commissions, fell 7 percent last year.\n\nThe Flurry deal is widely seen as one of Mayer's savviest moves since she defected from Google to Yahoo in July 2012, but that acquisition still hasn't been able to provide Yahoo with enough clout to become a major player in mobile.\n\nNone of Yahoo's apps are among the Top 70 in Apple's app store for the iPhone and its share of the mobile ad market remains small even though its revenue from smartphones and tablets is rapidly rising. Yahoo's mobile ad revenue totaled $1.05 billion last year, a 36 percent increase from last year. Yet its share of the $72 billion worldwide market for mobile ads decreased slightly to 1.5 percent last year to place it behind Google (with a share of nearly 34 percent), Facebook (17 percent), Alibaba, Baidu, Twitter and Tencent, according to the research firm eMarketer.\n\nAt Thursday's conference, Yahoo introduced a variety of improvements to Flurry's app and other tools in an attempt to attract more mobile advertising partners. The company is also trying to plant its search engine into more apps as a way to sell more ads.\n\nCheetah Mobile, a maker of device management apps such as Clean Master, has been impressed with its results since it started working with Yahoo, said marketing head David Wu.\n\n\"We all read the news, so we are obviously aware of the problems at Yahoo, but all the numbers have been moving in the right direction for us, so we hope they can stick around,\" Wu said.", "What do you get when you mix a 227-year-old law, iPhones, federal law enforcement and terrorism? Whatever it is, put the picture of it next to the word \"quandary\" in the dictionary.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook went public Wednesday with a letter to customers waxing philosophical about the implications of creating a master key which, to spare you the technobabble, would allow the FBI to unlock the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nMany have denounced the decision, unsurprisingly including GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump who asked \"who do they think they are?\"\n\nPerhaps in a more articulate prose, Shane Harris at the Daily Beast noted that Apple has played ball before in a 2015 New York court case and is only pulling an about-face because it might \"tarnish the Apple brand.\"\n\nIf Apple were grandstanding a bit of brand management (one could argue everything the company who's market share is $652 billion does is brand management) they still raise some good questions about where the future of privacy and the law stand.\n\nEdward Snowden, best known for blowing whistles, predictably supported Apple's move to take the discussion to the public. Snowden's tweet does raise an interesting point that the FBI is \"creating a world where citizens rely on Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around.\"\n\nI don't think Cook is resorting to whatever the liberal equivalent of fear mongering is when he says the U.S. government is asking Apple to take \"an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.\"\n\nThe support the FBI is asking for would compromise the supposedly unbreakable iPhone encryption, the passcode you type in to unlock your phone. Impressive and clever self-destruct features prevent the FBI from trying multiple pass codes repeatedly, lest the phone erases all of its valuable data, and Apple programming prevents the \"brute force\" tactic of having random pass codes entered electronically at a high rate of speed until it eventually unlocks, the password has to be entered manually.\n\nApple says were it to create the software necessary to circumvent these features, it could easily be reused and retooled for future endeavours.\n\nThe clever engineering at Apple is now going up against the legal engineering of the founding fathers. The All Writs Act, as old as American law itself (not an exaggeration), essentially gives the court power to make orders in unprecedented or quirky issues that haven't been covered in prior case law.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the emotion of the case at hand, especially one as horrible as the San Bernardino shooting, but moral and technological quagmires like this one have far-reaching consequences, good or bad, when the precedent is set.\n\nWhether or not Apple is posturing as a champion of the people for their own political gain, or because they are taking a legitimate moral stance, is besides the point now.\n\nThe questions are out there, and as more and more data enters the cloud -- who you are, where you were, what you said, what you saw -- it is our responsibility as the pioneers in this era of information to not fall asleep at the wheel.", "It's hard to overstate the tech world's fascination with the legal standoff between the FBI and Apple. Laymen might look at the dispute and shrug; after all, the FBI is just asking Apple to help hack into one phone, and it's not unusual for tech companies to help the police.\n\n\"Apple does provide 'reasonable assistance' to law enforcement all the time,\" says Jeff Fischbach, a forensic technologist who specializes in retrieving data from devices for use in court. But he says what the FBI is demanding from Apple in the San Bernardino case is qualitatively different.\n\n(For those who haven't been following the case: The FBI wants Apple to write custom software that would make it easier to hack into a locked iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in San Bernardino in December.)\n\n\"I'm not convinced that the FBI has actually pulled out all the stops on this particular phone,\" Fischbach wrote in an email to NPR. \"The concerns they cited exist in any iPhone [forensic] exam, and yet this time they've seemingly declared their hands tied. It feels opportunistic. Like a chance to expand their tool chest.\"\n\nMany tech experts suspect the federal government is taking advantage of the public sentiment surrounding the San Bernardino massacre to force Apple into accepting the premise that it's obliged to aid law enforcement even if it means creating new security weaknesses in the devices it sells.\n\nBut if that is the FBI's strategy, it's not necessarily a winning one. In his New York Times technology column, Farhad Manjoo concluded that the tech industry holds an ace: \"the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible.\"\n\nIt's true that companies such as Apple are usually a step ahead of law enforcement, technologically. Every new generation of device or operating system represents a challenge for the in-house hackers at the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It can take months for them to find a way into a new system, if they can find a way at all. And if the FBI succeeds in forcing Apple to write code to help hack this iPhone 5c, it's presumed the company will engineer the next generation of iPhones to be immune.\n\nBut the government is also holding an ace: the possibility of legislation.\n\nRobert Cattanach is an attorney specializing in cybersecurity who previously worked for the Justice Department. He predicts this fight will eventually go beyond the courts.\n\n\"Whoever is the loser in this will certainly plead their case to Congress,\" he says. \"Either, 'We need a backdoor,' if the FBI loses, or 'You can't give them a backdoor,' if Apple loses.\"\n\nThe question of whether tech companies should be required to build backdoors has been floating around Congress for a number of years now, pushed on one side by law enforcement's growing complaints about how encrypted technology is \"going dark\" to legitimate surveillance and detective work; and opposed on the other side by Silicon Valley. As is the case with so many pressing issues in Congress, nothing much has moved so far, but a public fight over San Bernardino could break the logjam.\n\nFor Fischbach, this is a worrisome possibility, because he thinks the emotions tied up in the San Bernardino case might cause Congress to take the side of the FBI.\n\nIt wouldn't be the end of encryption, he says, but it could be the end of easy-to-get encryption for the general public.\n\n\"[M]andating back doors only pushes the fringe,\" Fischbach writes. People in the know -- such as sophisticated crime syndicates or terror networks -- will still figure out how to keep data unreadable, but \"[f]or the rest of us with 'nothing to hide,' that just means we lose another piece of our privacy.\"", "Lawmaker says FBI needs access to iPhone to investigate terrorism links.\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, reportedly will introduce legislation soon to criminalize a company's refusal to aid decryption efforts as part of a governmental investigation. The news was first reported Thursday afternoon by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBurr's office did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.\n\nBurr published an op-ed in USA Today earlier today saying that Apple has \"wrongly chosen to prioritize its business model above compliance with a lawfully issued court order.\"\n\nThe North Carolina senator referred to the iPhone that was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife was responsible for the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. That iPhone has been seized by the FBI. Federal prosecutors succeeded in getting a court order Tuesday to compel Apple to aid the government in unlocking that phone, and Apple CEO Tim Cook said he'll fight the government's request.\n\nAs Sen. Burr wrote in USA Today:\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the Central District of California has issued an order directing Apple to assist law enforcement agents in unlocking the phone. There are no decryption demands in this case, and Apple is in no way required to provide a so-called backdoor. The FBI needs access to the phone so the agency can better piece together information about the terrorists and whom they contacted.\n\nMany legal experts, privacy advocates, and fellow tech companies have lined up behind Apple in its steadfast refusal to comply. Apple has three more business days to respond in court to the federal court order. As of this writing, it still had not done so.", "CORONA, Calif. -- FBI agents on Thursday searched the California home belonging to a family member of the husband-and-wife killers who massacred 14 people in the San Bernardino terror attack, but the relative was not arrested and has not been named a suspect.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook's brother, Syed Raheel Farook, is a military veteran who earned medals for fighting global terrorism. The search warrant is sealed, and FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller would not disclose any information other than to confirm a search was conducted at a home in the city of Corona in an ongoing investigation.\n\nTo serve a search warrant, authorities must have probable cause a crime was committed and items connected to the crime are likely to be found at the location.\n\nMessages left for attorneys representing the Farook family were not immediately returned.\n\nStacy Mozer, who lives around the corner from the home, said he watched as agents carried away armloads of boxes filled with manila envelopes, a computer tower and stacks of paper. At least a dozen agents were present.\n\nHe described Raheel Farook and wife Tatiana as ideal neighbors. The couple drove another neighbor to doctor's appointments last year when she had cancer surgery, treated her to meals out and fetched her prescriptions for her, even paying for them, he said.\n\nThe couple frequently strolled with their 1-year-old daughter around the community of town homes and took her to the pool.\n\n\"I would find it very hard to believe that they would be involved in any way,\" he said. \"I do know that if you have a family member, you don't have control of their lives, and I don't think they had control of their brother's life.\"\n\nMozer said the family's home was searched twice after the December shooting, and authorities broke down the door on an earlier occasion.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire Dec. 2 at a meeting of his San Bernardino County co-workers. They died hours later in a shootout with police. The 14 people killed marked the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nFarook's family has said it had no inkling about the plot.\n\nRaheel Farook was a Navy information system technician from 2003 to 2007, military records show. He was stationed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and received the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among other awards.\n\nThe chief of the FBI's Los Angeles field office told The Associated Press last month that some of the most basic questions related to the shootings had not been answered, including whether anyone else was involved. At the time, David Bowdich said investigators were not looking past anyone and had \"a very open mind on this investigation.\"\n\nThe search of the Farook home came a day after Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would fight federal government efforts to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by the gunman.\n\nSo far, the only person charged in connection with the attack is Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor of Rizwan Farook's. Marquez is charged with providing the assault rifles used in the massacre, making false statements about when he bought the weapons and conspiring with Rizwan Farook on a pair of previously planned attacks that were never carried out.\n\nMarquez also faces charges of marriage fraud and lying on immigration paperwork. The FBI said he acknowledged that he was paid $200 a month to marry the sister of Raheel Farook's wife, and he lied on immigration papers that he lived with her so she could stay in the U.S.\n\nMarquez and his wife listed their address at the same Corona home that was searched by the FBI on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMyers reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writer Amy Taxin in Tustin contributed to this report.", "Police and prosecutors in New York City said Thursday that the top-notch encryption technology on Apple mobile phones is now routinely hindering criminal investigations. And they predicted the problem could grow worse as more criminals figure out how well the devices keep secrets.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference that investigators cannot access 175 Apple devices sitting in his cybercrime lab because of encryption embedded in the company's latest operating systems.\n\n\"They're warrant proof,\" he said, adding that the inability to peer inside the devices was especially problematic because so much evidence once stored in file cabinets, on paper, and in vaults, is now only on criminals' smartphones.\n\nApple has marketed its encryption data as an important privacy tool, and many privacy advocates have praised the company, saying that if it opened its devices to government surveillance that ability to spy on users could be abused in places with authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company is currently fighting a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into an iPhone used by a gunman in December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a call Thursday for comment on the concerns of New York City authorities.\n\nVance didn't specify which cases were being hindered. But Police Commissioner William Bratton said a phone seized in the investigation of the shooting of two police officers in the Bronx last month is among those detectives can't crack. It was displayed Thursday alongside other phones, iPads and tablets similar to 600 devices the prosecutor's team tested, of which the 175 proved inaccessible.\n\nBratton said criminals are increasingly aware of the protection offered by their devices. He said a prisoner in a city jail was recently recorded saying in a phone call that iPhone encryption was \"another gift from God.\"\n\nVance said investigators have relied on phone data to investigate killings, child pornography, robbery and identity theft. He said that might include checking a suspect's contact list to get the names of witnesses or conspirators, or viewing incriminating videos and photographs.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has warned that creating software allowing the FBI to unlock the San Bernardino suspect's phone could make millions of other phones vulnerable to hackers and criminals.\n\nCook said that if Apple were forced by the courts to \"hack our own users,\" the government could order the company to build surveillance software to intercept all sorts of messages, \"access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge.\"", "BEIJING -- Apple Inc. on Thursday released its smartphone-based payment system in China, where the electronic payments market is already dominated by an arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\nApple said Apple Pay could be used with cards from 19 banks and \"numerous merchants.\" The merchants include supermarket Carrefour, fast food outlets McDonald's and KFC, and convenience store 7-Eleven, according to a news release from China UnionPay, the country's state-owned credit card processor that Apple is working with.\n\nApple's electronic payment system started in the United States in October 2014 and has since expanded to Britain, Canada and Australia. It will become available in Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain this year.\n\nApple Pay is a late arrival in a Chinese electronic payments market that offers smartphone users not just online shopping but also the option to order taxis, send money to friends, pay bills and invest in wealth management funds.\n\nThe market is dominated by Alipay, an arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. WeChat Payment, operated by social networking and gaming company Tencent Holdings Ltd, is also popular.\n\nApple's system will allow UnionPay cardholders to make payments at retail stores with Apple iPhones and Apple Watches.

A California judge ordered the company to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters responsible for the killing of 14 people, an attack which is being investigated as an act of terrorism. CEO Tim Cook argues that an update to Apple's firmware making it possible to retrieve information from the phone in question would open a back door for potential hackers to all iPhones. Here are the 10 most shared views on the order and Apple's refusal to comply.", "Vevo's done a lot of work over the last six months to improve its app ecosystem. First, the music-focused video service totally rebuilt its iOS app; it then brought those updates to Android and launched its first Apple TV app. They certainly made the Vevo experience better -- but after using YouTube Red and YouTube Music, using an ad-supported music video service felt like a step backward. Based on comments made yesterday by Vevo's CEO Erik Huggers, however, it sounds like that'll change soon.\n\nSpeaking at the Code/Media conference yesterday, Huggers said that Vevo was looking to add a subscription service to compliment its ad-supported business. A Vevo spokesperson confirmed Huggers' comments, noting that while there's no launch timeframe or pricing details just yet, the company is working towards that offering.\n\n\"Today our business is all about ad-supported,\" Huggers said at Code/Media. \"So we think that one of the important things -- we hear this throughout the industry -- is the move toward subscription. That's something we're interested in.\" Whether or not the company can be successful with such a service remains to be seen. YouTube Red gets you everything on YouTube ad-free, not just music videos; if Vevo wants to compete with it, its subscription service might need to come in at a lower price point.\n\nThe company's also been working on its own original music-related content. If it can get some noteworthy exclusives, that could also help drive the new business. It's a strategy that Tidal, Spotify and Apple Music have all used to varying degrees of success lately. However it plans on getting subscribers, it'll likely be a bit before we hear about the concrete business details.", "Having been denied by Apple, despite having a court order, the Federal Bureau of Investigations is quickly running out of options in its efforts to unlock one of the San Bernardino shooter's cell phones. They can't brute force the phone open for fear of the device wiping its data if they guess the wrong passcode too many times and many commercially available hacking tools require the phone already be unlocked. While the FBI is hamstrung in this specific investigation, the solution for similar cases in the future might instead lie with a mobile device's fingerprint reader.", "IBM open sources its blockchain code - the non-crazy part of Bitcoin\n\nAnalysis Public opinion over the judicial demand that Apple create a version of its mobile operating system for the FBI - dubbed FBiOS - appears to have landed firmly against the Feds.\n\nThe FBI has demanded Apple assist it in breaking into the mobile phone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in December. Agents are investigating the pair for possible terrorist links.\n\nThe Feds clearly felt that the case represented an ideal opportunity to assert its authority over Apple.\n\nBut an open letter from Apple CEO Tim Cook in which he made it clear the company would resist what it feels is \"overreach by the US government,\" appears to have turned public opinion in favor of Apple's stance.\n\nInitial reaction was mixed - with privacy advocates and Edward Snowden predictably coming out in favor and Donald Trump and right-wing Republican senators coming out against.\n\nBut with the full details and implications now more carefully considered 24 hours later, it appears that most agree with Cook that the US government ordering a company to create a product solely to break its own security is a step too far.\n\n\"We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack,\" said Cook. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai agreed, saying in a series of tweets: \"We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nOther tech companies stood by Cook's position as well. WhatsApp head Jan Koum also referenced the \"dangerous precedent\" that could be set and noted that \"our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\" Mozilla's executive director Mark Surman said much the same. Other companies that have made their support public include anonymizing browsers DuckDuckGo and the Tor Project, as well as password software company 1Password.\n\nInternet organizations have also come out in support.\n\nThe Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which includes Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo published a statement in support. \"Technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure,\" it stated.\n\nThe Internet Society also came out against the Fed's plan, noting: \"We do not believe backdoors - in any guise - will help bring about a more trusted Internet.\" And the Internet Infrastructure Coalition noted that the industry \"cannot support a government mandate to weaken security standards.\"\n\nWe have yet to find a single tech company or executive that has provided anything but support - with even Blackberry's CEO John Chen refusing to comment. Chen notably criticized Cook last year for the \"disdain\" he had shown law enforcement when he refused to unlock a different iPhone. Chen argued that a \"proper balance can be struck.\" Faced with what the Feds clearly felt was a proper balance, however, Chen has been silent.\n\nThat's the tech industry. What about the politicians?\n\nIn its first reaction, the White House emphasized that the access requested by the FBI was for \"just one device\" and it seems that was the line that the FBI and the political establishment was planning on pushing.\n\nIt is indeed true that what the FBI has asked for - and quite deliberately - would only work with the single phone in question due to the phone's own unique ID. Except, if Apple accepts the legal precedent that the FBI can oblige it to create a new product solely to break its own security, it would of course apply to all devices, one at a time.\n\nDespite one Congressman, Tom Cotton, implying that Apple is on the side of terrorist and child abusers, however, the political tide may have turned against the Feds.\n\nA number of Congress critters from both sides of the aisle have come out strongly in favor of Apple's position.\n\n\"Govt's demand that Apple undermine safety & privacy of all its customers is unconscionable & unconstitutional,\" tweeted Republican Justin Amash. Democrat Ron Wyden posted: \"FBI request to Apple is bad for Americans' online safety & security, could empower repressive regimes #NoBackdoors.\"\n\nDemocrat Zoe Lofgren put out a statement making the same point as everyone else: \"The order that Apple create a new operating system with a back door, using the 18th Century 'All Writs Act,' is an astonishing overreach of authority by the Federal government.\"\n\nLofgren also threatened to use political power against the FBI's legal efforts when she stated \"I urge the judicial branch to swiftly overturn this misguided ruling and further urge the Director of the FBI to refrain from seeking public policy decisions from the courts that are more properly decided by the Legislative branch of government.\"\n\nIt is far from universal however, with Republican Richard Burr writing an op-ed in USA Today titled \"Apple should not be above the law.\"\n\nAs for broader public opinion, that is of course hard to tell, but based on the seemingly endless stream of tweets on the topic, the tide does not appear to have turned from the very pro-Apple comments yesterday.\n\nIt also appears that people are taking the situation seriously enough to find out and understand the finer points of the situation: something that happens all too rarely.\n\nThe FBI was careful not to ask that Apple bypass is encryption, asserting only that it is asking the company to unlock Farook's iPhone 5C.\n\nBut what it is asking is that Apple create a version of its operating system solely to unlock the phone. And while the FBI clearly felt this was a smart way to get around the toxic \"backdoor\" argument, it clearly didn't reckon on the fact that the American people have a hard time with the US government demanding that someone create something just for them that goes against your own beliefs and interests.\n\nAs iPhone forensic expert Jonathan Zdziarski put it in a blog post: \"Not only is Apple being ordered to compromise their own devices; they're being ordered to give that golden key to the government, in a very roundabout sneaky way.\n\n\"What the FBI has requested will inevitably force Apple's methods out into the open, where they can be ingested by government agencies looking to do the same thing. They will also be exposed to private forensics companies, who are notorious for reverse engineering and stealing other people's intellectual property. Should Apple comply in providing a tool, it will inevitably end up abused and in the wrong hands.\"\n\nThe irony, Zdziarski also notes, is that there is some reason to believe that there is nothing of value on the phone of Syed Farook anyway. \u00ae", "As reported by Livestrong.com, people who want to lose weight, improve their fitness level, and boost their well-being can take a major step in that direction by choosing a diet that includes plenty of high protein, low carb foods.

That point is crucial because the government can't compel a company's help in some cases if doing so would be unreasonably burdensome, even though the U.S. would almost certainly pay Apple for the work.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook disputed the claims in his first public statement, distancing the company from the suggestion that it was protecting the privacy of a terrorist. \"The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government's efforts to solve this horrible crime,\" Cook said. \"We have no sympathy for terrorists.\"\n\nCook also said the FBI's latest demand went beyond previous requests for help: \"The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,\" Cook said. \"They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\"\n\nCook introduced that radioactive word -- \"backdoor\" -- into the current debate, and the White House quickly rejected it.\n\nThe pejorative term, describing a behind-the-scenes method hackers use to gain unauthorized access, has for years colored the discussion of how the government can obtain protected information or eavesdrop on encrypted communications from criminals or terrorists.\n\nThe government is stressing that it wants help to unlock only the work-issued iPhone used by Syed Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. The FBI is \"simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device,\" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.\n\nBut Apple says helping the U.S. bypass its encryption locks on Farook's iPhone would threaten the privacy of all its customers.\n\n\"While the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control,\" Cook said, adding: \"Ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Justice Department took the unusual step of responding to Cook's statement.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil,\" spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.\n\nThe back-and-forth marks an escalation of a dispute that, at least in public, has played out in mostly polite terms.

Ted Cruz said Apple should be compelled to help the government hack the iPhone because it's a binding order.\n\n\"Any time you're dealing with issues of security, and civil liberties, you got to balance them both.

Team members Awdi, Krambeck, Lewandowski, Oakley, Sherwani and Stanek represented the team at Texas A&M.\n\nThe Hyperloop is a conceptual high-speed transportation system put forward by Tesla Motors owner and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors.\n\nTeam captain Sherwani, who is enrolled in the Engineering program at COD and plans to transfer to a four-year university in the fall, said she is proud of the team's performance at the competition.\n\n\"The judges had very nice things to say about our designs and it was really cool to meet and share ideas with students from more than 16 countries around the world,\" she said. \"We also spoke with and received advice from leading engineers at SpaceX and Tesla. This was a tough project and I'm really proud of how our team handled the stress.\"\n\nIn addition to attending COD, Sherwani currently works as a product specialist at Tesla and hopes to enroll in an aerospace engineering program and work toward her goal of becoming an astronaut. She said the team's design received positive attention from the judges and other teams at the competition.\n\n\"One thing that made our design unique was our focus on ergonomics,\" Sherwani said. \"We wanted to make sure that passengers were as comfortable and safe as possible. While our pod design did not advance, we were advised by SpaceX and Hyperloop engineers to collaborate with one of the advancing teams. We have received interest from several universities and are currently in the process of deciding which advancing team to collaborate with in further stages of this competition. We also plan on patenting our seat design.\"\n\nTeam member Krambeck, a COD Computer Engineering student, noted several highlights from the competition.\n\n\"It was great to receive input from teams from around the world about their designs and how they approached the same problems we had,\" Krambeck said. \"It was also incredible to see how much attention our design received from those same teams. In addition, it was amazing to just be in the same room with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Elon Musk.\"\n\nBoth Krambeck and Sherwani said the competition provided a wonderful educational experience.\n\n\"I learned that teamwork is extremely essential in the engineering field,\" Krambeck said. \"I believe we performed very well as a team. We received recognition from several four-year university teams for the extensive detail that went into our design. I also learned that anything is possible if you put enough hard work and determination into it. This was something that was almost dream-like to our whole team; the whole time we were saying we could still not believe we're in Texas about to present in front of SpaceX and Tesla engineers.\"\n\nSherwani said participating in the competition provided an experience beyond classroom learning.\n\n\"Every single person had something unique to bring to the table,\" she said. \"Some of us were good at calculations and others at drawing and making digital renderings. Stepping out of our comfort zones helped us grow as people and I truly believe we have all become better people since starting this project.\"\n\nKrambeck, who plans to earn both her bachelor's and master's degrees after completing an A.E.S. in Computer Science at COD, said while the team members discovered the competition and initiated the project themselves, they received substantial support from their COD instructors and College staff.\n\n\"This project demonstrated that there is huge faculty and staff support behind us,\" Krambeck said. \"This isn't just a community college that wants to teach and leave it at that. Everyone took time out of their schedules to help us prepare our presentation and help us get down to the design competition weekend.\"\n\nClick here for more information about the College of DuPage Engineering program.", "A Few More Sit-Ups Might Help: Go into any gym today and you'll probably be hit with talk about how you need to build up your core. Core strength is everything, right? Without a strong core, your back and knees can give out and then you end up a mess of flab and weak bones.\n\nAnd few tech companies are currently seen as weaker than Yahoo, and its core might be getting too soft to save.\n\nAccording to what the Information is calling \"confidential internal data,\" three of Yahoo's core products -- Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Search and the company's Yahoo.com home page -- are far from six-pack-ab status. The data, which charts usage between December 2014 and December 2015, purports to show declines in average usage of all three Yahoo products no matter how one wants to measure them.\n\nOver that year, daily average users (DAUs) of Yahoo Mail declined 11.5 percent, to 56.9 million users. The Yahoo.com homepage saw a decline of 16.5 percent for DAUs, to 52.6 million. And Yahoo Search DAUs fell to 43.5 million, off by almost 9 percent year-over-year. Usage of all three core products also fell on mobile devices and in terms of total minutes a day.\n\nThe problem with this, aside from suggesting that fewer and people people use Yahoo for anything, is that much of the talk about whatever value Yahoo might have left has centered around its core businesses. If that core isn't attractive and in shape, then what could Yahoo use to entice possible buyers as it explores \"strategic alternatives\"? Maybe Chief Executive Marisa Mayer could offer free zamboni rides?\n\nMiddle Innings:\n\nAnd You Thought Taylor vs. Kanye Was Big: One of the biggest bouts since the Thrilla In Manila began shaping up Wednesday as Apple threw down the gauntlet against the FBI.\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook said his company wouldn't bow down to a demand to help the FBI, in effect, hack into the iPhone 5c that belonged to San Bernadino shooter Syed Farook. In a letter he posted on Apple's website, Cook said Apple couldn't comply with a federal court order to build a \"backdoor\" method of breaking into Farook's phone. The problem from the FBI's standpoint is that a passcode is needed to unlock the phone. And when such a feature is enabled, the phone will give you 10 tries to get the four-digit passcode correct. But if you mess up on the 11th try, the phone's data will be erased.\n\n\"The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,\" Cook said in his letter. \"They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\"\n\nAnd with 10,000 possible code combinations, it's easy to see why the FBI might want some help getting into the phone. Imagine agents Mulder and Scully standing around the phone in the bowels of the FBI's headquarters, just daring each other to try another code.\n\nWhat's $10 Million Between Family Members?: Let's get the bad jokes out of the way early.

Because on May 15, SolarCity shares hit a 52-week-high of $63.79. By last Friday, the stock had lost almost 74 percent of its value. And then, the sun began to rise for SolarCity. On Tuesday, SolarCity shares rose almost 6 percent, and then on Wednesday, the company's stock surged to close with a gain of more than 13 percent, at $20.79.\n\nThis is what happens when Elon Musk puts a loose $10 million into your company.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that last Friday, Musk bought $10 million worth of SolarCity stock, and at a relative bargain of $17.56 a share, according to a regulatory filing. You need to remember that while Musk is best known for being the CEO of Tesla Motors, he is also the chairman of SolarCity, which he helped start along with his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive.\n\nMusk's $10 million stock purchase is kind of like the equivalent of the NBA star who gets a nine-figure contract and then buys fancy cars for all his relatives and friends from back home. SolarCity may be like the team that's in perpetual rebuilding mode. And if Musk is its star player, he'd be smart to remember to put a few bucks away for when his playing days are over.\n\nBottom Of The Lineup:\n\nHere's a look at how some leading Silicon Valley tech stocks did Wednesday...\n\nMovin' On Up: SolarCity had a good day, but SilverSpring Networks did even better, as its shares rose 13.2 percent. GoPro continued to gain ground for no notable reason, with its shares rising 12 percent. Pandora Media and Impax Laboratories shares each rose more than 11 percent, and Tesla Motors (There's Cousin Elon, again) climbed almost 9 percent on the day.\n\nIn The Red: Video-infrastructure technology company Harmonic fell 5.7 percent in the wake of a disappointing quarterly report late Tuesday.

His huge successes (and some epic failures) are often overshadowed by other notable tech entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.\n\nNevertheless, his accomplishments are just as significant, if not more so than the industry's most popular leaders.\n\nIn case you aren't entirely clear on who Elon Musk is, he is responsible for some of the most innovative and forward-thinking technology in the world including PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors.\n\nAnd it's important to note that these companies and their innovations have only been around since the beginning of the 2000s. That means in just 15 years, Musk quickly moved the tech industry into places that were previously reserved for science fiction.\n\nUnlike technology, the real estate industry is pretty slow to evolve. Brokers and agents have mostly been using the same methods for well over 50 years. Sure, there have been small improvements with the introduction of cell phones and the Internet, but the infrastructure of real estate has remained largely unchanged.\n\nIf agents were to embrace the same tactics that have made Musk successful, think of what could be accomplished in real estate! Here are four lessons from Elon Musk that can inspire agents to think outside the box and take real estate to the next level.\n\n1. Network and connect\n\nAs a college student, Musk cold-called interesting people that he would like to meet. One of those people was Peter Nicholson, a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nThis phone call led to a meeting with Nicholson and landed Musk a summer internship. Musk's experience at the bank would eventually be the impetus for the digital payment service PayPal.\n\nThere is fortune in the follow-through. Do you reach out to people you admire? Are you willing to push your comfort zone to make connections with the best of the best?\n\nPeople outside of real estate have just as much to offer, if not more than industry experts. Don't limit yourself. Who knows what someone in an entirely different profession can offer you?\n\nTeaming up and combining expertise can provide unlimited opportunities to grow and create.\n\n2. Invest in yourself\n\nMusk invested more than half of his earnings from the sale of his first company into PayPal. Risky? Sure. But this is what separates Musk from everyday entrepreneurs -- he believes in himself so much that he is willing to make insane investments to turn an idea into a reality.\n\nYou might not have millions of dollars to invest, but consider the return on what you can afford. Splurge on a pricey seminar or coaching session if it creates systems to hold you accountable.\n\nHire an assistant to take on your menial tasks (such as paperwork and scheduling appointments) so you can focus on closing deals. Give yourself the things you need to remove roadblocks and grow.\n\nGive yourself the things you need to remove roadblocks and grow.\n\nClick To Tweet\n\n3. Disturb the comfortable\n\nMusk has never been afraid to shake things up. He completely ignored everything we knew about car manufacturing and created something entirely different. And though it's not the flying car, the inception of Tesla has completely upset the auto industry.\n\nTesla is insanely efficient, completely upgradable (without having to buy a whole new vehicle) and undeniably luxurious. Even the act of purchasing a Tesla is outside the box.\n\nMuch like the automobile industry, real estate has remained the same for decades. It's complacent, predictable and boring.\n\nBut what if you shook it up? What would happen if you pushed the envelope and disregarded the way it's always been done?\n\nRadical change is scary because not only does it upset the status quo, but it also completely tramples it. You have to sacrifice what is popular for what is needed.\n\n4. Go for the moonshot\n\nThe moonshot is doing the thing that seems the most insane. It's the things that no one thinks is possible.\n\nThe final frontier has historically been a nationally funded enterprise -- until Musk. His belief: \"If you can dream it, you can build it,\" landed him in a literal moonshot situation.\n\nSpaceX is the first commercial company to build a rocket and successfully deliver supplies to the international space station. This is all a result of Musk's relentless belief that nothing is impossible.\n\nThe moonshot is what happens when you put everything into practice and execute. If you are connecting with people, investing in yourself and challenging the status quo, you are laying the foundation to achieve the unattainable.\n\nI went from Realtor to CEO of a software company because I took a chance on the moonshot, and it was one of the scariest things I've ever done.\n\nMaybe you have a crazy idea that will change the way agents buy and sell homes. What could you accomplish if you knew you could not fail?\n\nMusk is more than just an entrepreneur. Unlike his peers, Musk is legitimately trying to solve real world problems.\n\nIn \"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,\" biographer Ashlee Vance wrote \"Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to ... well ... save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.\"\n\nIt's a pretty big endeavor, and Musk exemplifies the gumption and determination it takes to make real change.\n\nWe need more people like Musk in real estate. We need more thought leaders and more industry disrupters. Although the future of real estate might not take us to Mars, we should start thinking about how to buy and sell homes up there.\n\nElon Musk exemplifies the gumption and determination it takes to make real change.\n\nClick To Tweet\n\nTyler Smith is founder and CEO of SkySlope.

Brian Sandoval delivers last year's State of the State address inside the Assembly Chambers in Carson City on Thursday, 3Jan. 15, 2015. His address marked the start of Nevada's 78th legislative session, a session that saw the passage of more than 500 bills.\n\nState politics, unlike its federal counterpart, is an often overlooked part of any American's daily life. This goes doubly for young Americans (read: college students), who are less politically active than any other demographic, according to the Census Bureau. But even if Americans aren't paying that much attention, state governments are still hammering away at all kinds of legislation that directly affects the daily grind.\n\nNevada is no exception, so without further ado, here's the year in Nevada politics.\n\nThe legislative session\n\nThe Nevada Assembly and Senate only convene once every other year for a brief, five-month stint where all the legislating for the next two years has to happen, barring any special legislative sessions.\n\nIn 2015, Nevada's 78th legislative session started with a bang after Brian Sandoval announced a revamped budget during his biennial State of the State address that allocated nearly $900 million for education. This revamp included millions for K-12 schools to improve everything from technology to gifted and talented programs, as well as some added money for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' hospitality school and proposed medical school.\n\nTo pay for all this, the Legislature eventually approved a host of tax reforms, including $560 million in the continuation of the so-called sunset taxes, which were enacted in 2007 and were engineered to expire, not unlike the sun after a long day (hence \"sunset\"), once the state no longer needed the money.\n\nIn terms of actual policy, most legislation was passed with ease or quietly smothered in committee, and spats in the statehouse were few and far between. However, there was a notable rift among legislators when it came to the campus carry debate, where GOP lawmakers led by Las Vegas Assemblywoman Michele Fiore sought to allow concealed carry weapons on school grounds.\n\nLegislators fought the entire session over campus carry before the effort was shut down in committee just days before legislators packed up and left. In any case, legislators passed 550 bills by session's end, all of which were signed into law by Gov. Sandoval.\n\nOutside the normal session, Sandoval convened a special legislative session at the end of the year to review a $1 billion deal between the state and Faraday Future, an electric car maker seeking to build a 900-acre factory in North Las Vegas. That deal comes on top of Nevada's deal with car-maker Tesla Motors to build the \"gigafactory\" just outside of Reno.\n\nNew laws of note\n\nWith Senate Bill 374, the Legislature directed the Nevada Public Utilities Commission to revise the rate structure for Nevadans using rooftop solar panels. On Dec. 22, the commission voted unanimously to increase rates, drawing the ire of solar providers in the state. These providers have argued that the changes do more to hurt solar energy in the state by disincentivizing consumers to switch to solar.\n\nSenate Bill 307 has now made it unlawful for lobbyists to give legislators gifts and prohibits legislators from accepting \"anything of value,\" according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. In other election news, voters can now choose to receive an electronic sample ballot as opposed to receiving a paper ballot in the mail with the passage of Assembly Bill 94.\n\nSenate Bill 302, arguably the most controversial new law, allows parents to get state funds to pay for private school tuition. Part of Sandoval's sweeping education reforms, the law is aimed at providing parents whose children are zoned for under-performing public schools to choose private school instead. Some 4,000 parents have signed up for the program, according to the RJ, but these parents are now stuck in limbo as a state judge has granted an injunction to the law's opponents, effectively stopping its implementation.\n\nOpponents of the law have called it unconstitutional because it provides public school funds to pay for private tuition, potentially harming public school students while violating a 2006 amendment to the Nevada constitution that requires the Legislature to appropriate funds for public schools before all other funds.\n\nThis new law would mean that extra funds are siphoned away from that initial pool for public schools, reducing the amount that the Legislature had previously \"deemed sufficient,\" and thus would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe fight over Senate Bill 302 will likely continue into the coming months as it heads all the way to the Nevada Supreme Court.", "As the sun set on 2015, the IRS quietly and quickly moved to update a program giving massive tax credits to solar companies like Elon Musk's SolarCity for rechargeable lithium batteries.\n\nThe 30 percent Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows residential customers and solar energy companies the ability to get taxpayer cash for buying energy batteries for their solar arrays.\n\nThe ITC was scheduled to expire Dec. 31, but Congress extended it at the last moment to lengthen tax credit, potentially giving solar companies such as SolarCity and solar mega-company SunEdison billions of dollars worth of tax credits. The IRS later extended the ITC to include rechargeable batteries.\n\n\"This new ruling from the IRS provides the clarity needed to unlock the solar + storage industry,\" Jigar Shah, former SunEdison CEO, told reporters.\n\nSolar companies have peppered the government over the years with questions about how much the tax credit applies to the new power storage projects -- including projects such as Tesla Motors' Powerwall, which stores electricity derived from solar power for domestic consumption and backup power.\n\nPrior to the extension, solar companies and government officials haggled over whether the 30 percent ITC would cover electricity stored using solar panels and the electric grid.\n\n\"The federal government does not want to incentivize people to 'arbitrage' energy from the grid,\" Mike Kleinberg, Senior Consultant at renewable energy consultant company, DNV-GL.\n\nHe added: \"You cannot charge from the grid in the evening and then discharge during the day to supplement your PV -- and also qualify for the ITC, because you're not then really charging from renewable energy.\"\n\n\"In essence, if during year one, the taxpayer is not careful and allows too much of the electricity stored in the battery to be drawn from the grid, no portion of the energy tax credit is available for the battery regardless of the battery's mix of stored electricity in later years,\" he cautioned.\n\nOther tech companies specializing in storage facilities have shown interest in the ITC as well.\n\n\"Our customers are very interested in the 30 percent ITC,\" Jim Deichert, Division Manager for Off-Peak Heating at Steffes, told reporters.\n\nOff-Peak Heating has a similar energy storage model: smart ceramic space heaters designed to store surplus electricity as heat.\n\nIt was revealed in January that solar companies may not be able to survive without government support.\n\nNevada's Public Utilities Commission (PUC), instructed by Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, changed the state's solar-metering rules in the early part of 2016. The rule change means solar energy providers SolarCity and SunEdison will see a substantial dip in pay from their energy panels.\n\nThe PUC, in short, acknowledged solar-panel users would get paid for the energy their panels generate at lower, wholesale rates instead of at the higher, retail rates. The change means customers will pay nearly the whole retail cost of solar energy production.\n\nWith the rule change, the service charge for solar panels in Nevada will increase 40 percent from $12.75 to $17.90 per month.\n\nAs a result of the change, SolarCity decided to cut ties with Nevada because of its desire to cut solar companies off government support, which suggests the solar industry relies heavily on government tax credits for survival. SolarCity dropped 500 employees from its payroll as a result of the move out of the state.\n\n\"I contacted Governor Sandoval multiple times after the ruling because I am convinced that he and the PUC didn't fully understand the consequences of this decision, not only on the thousands of local jobs distributed solar has created, but on the 17,000 Nevadans that installed solar with the state's encouragement,\" SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive told a reporters.\n\nFollow Chris on Facebook and Twitter", "HARTFORD, Conn. (WTNH) - Tesla motors announced Wednesday, that they are a step closer to selling electric vehicles directly to consumers in Connecticut.\n\nJim Chen, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Deputy General Counsel at Tesla Motors, released a statement following actions by the Transportation Committee to draft policies that would allow for direct sale of electric vehicles (EVs) to Connecticut consumers.\n\n\"By raising this bill, they are sending a clear message that Connecticut is ready to embrace innovation, economic growth and consumer choice.

LeEco, formerly known as LeTV, is famous for producing Internet-based TV sets and producing online content. The partnership of British luxury car maker and Chinese tech company underscores amalgamation of Internet-based connectivity in auto industry.\n\nAccording to press release by Aston Martin, the company plans to develop its first electric car based on the Rapide S model. The Rapide sedan was announced last year by Aston Martin, which is expected to lock horns with industry rivals, including Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). According to the company, the potential Tesla killer can boost over 800 horsepower and can run 200 mile on full battery charge, having the same range of upcoming Tesla Model 3. Electric vehicle (EV) from Aston Martin is expected to hit markets in 2018.\n\nAccording to AutoBlog, the Chief Executive of Aston Martin, Andy Palmer confirmed production of Rapid EV last spring. The car is rumored to be all-wheel drive EV, and caters to only high-end niche market. The automaker may build few hundreds of these expensive cars that may cost between $200,000 and $250,000.\n\nThe partnership of auto companies and tech giants is not new. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was rumored to be working with Google for autonomous car project, while iPhone maker Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is said to working on its auto project dubbed \"Titan\" that may ship its first car by 2019, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese tech companies are also bringing their expertise into automotive industry for research and development of Internet-connected cars and self-driving vehicles. Last month, China's search giant Baidu announced to bring its own autonomous car as early as 2017.\n\nIn a press release, Aston Martin said: \"It is anticipated that the partnership will see the two companies working together in developing and manufacturing Rapide, with potential for adding a range of next-generation connected electric vehicles on behalf of Aston Martin, LeEco and Faraday Future.\"\n\nThe interesting thing to note here is that Faraday Future is also going to complement the partnership of the British car maker and LeEco. Faraday Future took over the media in a buzz with the launch of its mysterious EV by the name FFZero1 Supercar at last month's CES. This means that Mr. Yeuting is very close to become a big player of EV market in China. He is often called as Chinese Elon Musk, because of his past engineering background and recent foray into EV space.\n\nA partnership of LeEco, Aston Martin and Faraday Futures can pose serious threat to Palo Alto based Tesla Motors, which is currently struggling to ramp production of its high-end Model X crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV). Tesla Motors is dreaming to win mass market by launching its Model 3 EV in 2017, but the EV maker has to face several rivals in the space. Chinese backed Faraday Future and Atieva are already launching their Tesla killers within the next three years, while German automaker Porsche and Audi are also planning to launch Mission E electric car in 2019.\n\nThe electric vehicle craze has developed in China because of the tireless efforts from the government supporting the EV markets in the world's largest auto market. China has been tackling its smog problem for a very long time, and thinks high EV adoption rate would help the country to fight the killer smog that envelops the urban cities. The country has announced financial incentives to electric car makers by 2020, to boost production of EVs.\n\nAll such efforts were fruitful as the green car sales jumped four times last year from 2014, according to Reuters. The country has set a target to put a total of five million cars on roads by 2020.\n\nAfter getting hit since the start of the year, Tesla stock is finally rebounding after earnings call last week and is currently up 7.79% at $167.26 as of 1:12 PM EST. The stock has lost over 30% so far this year.", "Shutterstock photo\n\nFRANKFURT -- Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. is creating a joint venture with Chinese partner LeEco to help bring its first electric car to market in 2018, a move that creates an informal affiliation with Los Angeles-based electric car startup, Faraday Future Inc.\n\nLeEco, formerly called Letv, is a primary backer of Faraday, a company with about 500 employees planning to build a factory in the U.S. and sell electric cars in 2017. While Aston Martin, a storied British brand, shares the same backer, it emphasized that is not currently working with Faraday. However, it said in a statement that all three companies may work together in the future.\n\nSpeaking about the partnership with LeEco at a join news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said: \"We're on the way to creating a joint venture...it will help [bring] a product for Aston Martin EV quicker to market than we anticipated.\"\n\nLeEco is a China-based consumer electronics firm that offers a variety of services, including smartphones and a video service similar to Netflix. Aston Martin already collaborates with LeEco on in-car entertainment systems for the Rapide S, and the two companies are jointly developing zero-emission technologies.\n\nYueting Jia, the founder of LeEco, a billionaire entrepreneur often likened to Elon Musk, has made investments in a number of electric-car ventures. In addition to Faraday, which intends to produce and sell an electric car as soon as 2017, LeEco has invested in Silicon Valley-based Atieva Inc., which is designing an electric car.\n\nFaraday recently started work on a plant in North Las Vegas where it intends to make its first vehicle. The company has added hundreds of workers in a short period of time, recruiting engineers from Ford Motor Co., Tesla Motors Inc. and many others.\n\nMr. Palmer, who joined Aston in late 2014, was a key advocate at Nissan Motors Inc. for the electric-vehicle program there. Nissan, with its Leaf electric car, is a world leader in electric vehicles.\n\nA spokesman for Aston Martin said that the RapidE's performance figures should be at least as good those of the four- door Rapide S, which can accelerate from 0-60 miles an hour in 4.3 seconds, and has a top speed of 203 mph.\n\nThe British sports car maker has more than 100 years of history producing luxury vehicles, but has struggled with development costs since being sold by Ford to private investors in 2007.\n\nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-17-161255ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines Referenced Stocks: 7201 , F , NFLX , NSANY , TSLA", "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has officially expanded its Powerwall battery shipment to Australia.

Radio Flyer teamed up with Tesla to make a pint-sized Model S for a slightly younger demographic than the full-size model.\n\nThe toy Tesla includes working headlights and an opening front trunk, which Tesla owners affectionately call a \"frunk.\" It's also got forward and reverse gears and an audio system that can play music from smartphones or MP3 players. There are three exterior paint colors to choose from -- Midnight Silver Metallic, Deep Blue Metallic, and Red Multi-Coat -- based on colors offered on the full-size Model S.\n\nPerhaps to put parents at ease, there's no Ludicrous mode here. Top speed is 3 mph for \"beginners,\" and 6 mph for more seasoned drivers. Unlike most toy cars, Radio Flyer can at least claim its Tesla uses the same type of powertrain as the real thing. There's a weight limit of 81 pounds, so any adults looking to fantasize about Tesla ownership are out of luck.\n\nPricing starts at $499 but just like a real car there are plenty of optional extras. A 190-watt-hour lithium-ion battery can be specified for $50, allowing for a bit more play time than the standard 140-Wh battery (range anxiety is apparently an issue even with toy electric cars). Silver turbine wheels (as opposed to the standard black) are available for $15 and a car cover is available for $50. A custom license plate and parking sign can also be had for $15 and $25, respectively.\n\nRadio Flyer is accepting pre-orders now and plans to ship the first mini Teslas in May.", "On Wednesday, Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced its full-year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results. The company reported a fourth quarter loss of $0.87 missing the Wall Street analyst consensus of a profit of $0.10 by 970 percent. Tesla reported that $0.13 of the $0.87 loss was attributable to \"mostly to unrealized losses from foreign currency revaluation\" in the company's shareholder letter hosted with Shareholder.com.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla sister company, for which Tesla CEO Elon Musk serves as chairman and his cousin, Lyndon Rive, serves as CEO, SolarCity, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCTY) also reported its full-year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results. SolarCity reported a per share loss of $2.37, beating a reduced Wall Street consensus of a loss of $2.59 by 8.5 percent.\n\nSCTY stock is down by 34.0 percent since the results were announced and by 70.1 percent over the past 12 months. TSLA shares have rallied marginally since the Wednesday evening announcement, by 5.1 percent; over the past 12-month period the shares have fallen by 26.1 percent. TSLA shares have fallen 47.3 percent from their all-time high, $286.65, printed on July 20, 2015.\n\nAccording to the NASDAQ, Elon Musk owns 28,371,342 TSLA shares and 21,275,994 SCTY shares, currently valued at $4.29 billion and $369.78 million respectively.\n\nOn February 10, the day after SolarCity announced its financial results, which saw SCTY shares plummet, GuruFocus reported on the loans Musk has secured using his TSLA stock holdings. According to the website, Musk's margin of safety with his loans has fallen from 48 percent to 9.5 percent.\n\nStockbrokers and other financial institutions will accept stock holdings as collateral on loans, typical loaning a maximum of 70 percent of a stock's value, as reported by TD. Stock traders sometimes use these loans to buy more stock than they can afford, taking on levered positions, amplifying both profits and losses. CEOs and others who receive stock as part of their compensation packages have also been known to use these loans to secure cash, allowing them to maintain their holdings without sacrificing their personal liquidity.\n\nIf Musk's 9.5 percent margin of safety reported by GuruFocus is correct, it would mean that a $15 drop, down to about $135, in TSLA shares could force the CEO to raise cash to meet a margin call. One way Musk might raise cash is by selling some of his TSLA or SCTY shares, which could force the prices of the stocks down further, possibly triggering more margin calls, possibly beginning a vicious cycle for Musk, as well as SolarCity and Tesla shareholders.\n\nMusk may have also used his SCTY shares to secure loans.\n\nIt has been noted that at least a portion of Musk's loans have been issued by financial institutions that hold underwriting relationships with Tesla: there is a large incentive for these institutions to support the price of both SCTY and TSLA.\n\nSince Tesla reported its financial results on Wednesday, shares of TSLA and SCTY have traded relatively flat on much-higher than regular turnover, a market state described by some observers as churning, as reported by Dave Manuel.\n\nIt is not uncommon for publicly traded companies to miss EPS estimates by 5 or 10 percent and witness little change in their stock price. However, for a company to miss earnings by 970 percent, and for its sister company's shares to be sold so heavily just the previous day, suggests that there could be two groups of participants in the markets for TSLA and SCTY shares: longtime investors who have lost patience with the management teams and are selling, and new investors who appear to be defending the stocks, seemingly illogically, given the companies' dismal financial performance.\n\nCould the institutions who have issued margin loans to Musk be desperately attempting to protect the stocks, hoping that the trend in each will turn, thereby avoiding a margin call? If this is the case, how much more capital are these institutions willing to risk propping up shares of companies that have performed so poorly? Have TSLA and SCTY shares bottomed? The answer to these questions may become apparent in the coming trading sessions of each.\n\nThere is no doubt that Tesla is an innovative company. However, the idea that electric cars are more environmentally friendly than gas-powered cars has been disputed in a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, as reported by Investor's Business Daily.\n\nA comparison of electric and gas-powered cars caused the study's authors to conclude \"that electric cars, despite the hype, aren't as environmentally clean as gasoline-powered cars.\"\n\nThis does not mean that the idea of an electric car company is not viable -- it does, however, suggest that electric cars are a niche market, and that there really isn't much difference in the business model between General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Tesla.\n\nThe stock market, however, values each of the companies very differently.\n\nGeneral Motors produced close to 1 million vehicles in 2015. Clean Technica reports that Tesla \"delivered\" 50,580 vehicles in 2015.\n\nTesla appears to have delivered about 5 percent of the number of cars that General Motors did in 2015.\n\nGeneral Motors reported $152.36 billion in sales in 2015. Tesla reported $4.05 billion in sales in 2015, or about 2.7 percent of General Motors', seemingly in-line with productions figures.\n\nThe stock market, however, values General Motors as a whole (its market capitalization) at $42.80 billion, while it values Tesla at $19.78 billion, or 46.2 percent of General Motors'.\n\nThat Tesla's production is 5 percent of GM's, that Tesla's sales are 2.7 percent of GM's, and that the market is valuing Tesla as being worth 46.2 percent of GM, is puzzling.\n\nTesla has an ambitious plan to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2020. Assuming that GM's production remains flat (it will likely grow, though not at the same pace as Tesla's), this means that Tesla, if it meets its goals, could produce about 50 percent as many vehicles as GM in 2020. If this happens, it would seem that Tesla would deserve to be valued at about 50 percent of GM: in 2020, not in 2016.\n\nForward price earnings ratios for each company further compound this view. Based on 2017 earnings estimates, the market is giving General Motors a forward PE of 4.78, and Tesla a forward PE of 38.73. To the stock market, a dollar produced by Tesla is worth 8.1 times more than a dollar produced by GM, which would seem completely unsustainable. Given that Tesla is a young, innovative, and fashionable company, a forward PE ratio twice the size of GM's might be appropriate; 8.1 times seems absurd.\n\nIf Tesla was revalued with a PE twice that of GM's its shares would trade near $38.\n\nOver time, the PE ratios of each company will almost certainly converge. The question that will be decided by the market will be whether GM valuation needs to come up, or Tesla valuation needs to come down.\n\nIf this convergence happened on Tuesday and was shared equally by each, GM shares would rally by about 355 percent to near $126, while Tesla shares would see their price cut by about 45 percent, to near $85.00.\n\n[Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]", "Back in the '90s when my kids were toddlers, my Silicon Valley neighborhood had a Cozy Coupe kid-size car in every driveway.

It holds a driver who weighs up to 81 lbs; there is no passenger seat, but there is a \"frunk\" (a front trunk) to hold emergency snacks and teddy bears.\n\nFully tricked out with all the extras, including a premium 190-Wh battery, a spare premium battery, \"silver turbine wheels,\" a personalized license plate, and a car cover, this mini Model S will cost more than $800. (A Cozy Coupe will set you back $49 these days)\n\nIn spite of the cost, this new electric vehicle is sure to be a huge hit in Silicon Valley -- and I'm guessing I'll see more than a few tiny Model S's zipping around the bins of sodas and beer at block parties this summer.", "The long-awaited Model 3 may succeed -- but not as a mass-market vehicle.\n\nTesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) has taken the auto world by storm with its highly sought-after luxury electric vehicles. Its Model S sedan became the top-selling large luxury vehicle in the U.S. last year, with more than a quarter of the market. The new Model X crossover seems likely to be equally popular.\n\nDemand for Tesla's new Model X is rising quickly. Image source: Tesla Motors.\n\nTesla's next vehicle will be the significantly cheaper Model 3. Tesla will start taking reservations for the Model 3 in late March, and the company says it is on track to begin deliveries in late 2017. Many observers are skeptical of this timeline, given Tesla's penchant for delays, yet there are some reasons for optimism about an on-time launch in this case.\n\nTesla bulls think that the Model 3 will make Tesla a huge success in the mass market. However, mass-market success will probably require an even cheaper vehicle than the Model 3. True mass-market automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) may be better able to fill that need.\n\nThe Model 3 will be expensive\n\nThe Model 3 will have a base price of $35,000 in the U.S., according to Tesla. A federal tax credit will knock $7,500 off the price -- although you need to have a tax liability of at least that amount to get the full benefit. In some states, such as California, state tax credits get the price down to around $25,000.\n\nAt that price, Tesla's Model 3 could be a big threat to traditional automakers in the mass market. However, most buyers will have to pay dramatically more than this amount.\n\nMost notably, the $7,500 federal tax credit will start to phase out soon after Tesla reaches 200,000 cumulative sales in the U.S. This will probably occur sometime in 2018, depending on how fast Model 3 production ramps up. Thus, by 2020, Tesla buyers will be paying more than $30,000 for a base version of the Model 3, even after any available tax incentives.\n\nFurthermore, very few customers will actually get the base model. A typical Model S buyer spends tens of thousands of dollars on options. Just upgrading the Model S battery to improve range from 240 miles to 288 miles costs an eye-watering $13,000.\n\nMost Model S buyers spend tens of thousands of dollars on option packages. Image source: Tesla Motors.\n\nGiven that the entry-level Model 3 could have as little as 200 miles of range, it will be even more tempting to get a larger battery. Other options packages could bring the Model 3's average transaction price to $60,000, according to auto analyst Adam Jonas.\n\nThis isn't the mass market anymore\n\nGiven Tesla's typically slow production ramp and its strategy of delivering heavily optioned vehicles first, the federal tax credit will likely be on its way out (or already gone) by the time Tesla is ready to deliver cheaper versions. This means that even buyers choosing modest option packages will be paying $40,000 or more.\n\nThis price point is nowhere near \"mass market\" levels. While the average transaction price for new vehicles in the U.S. is currently around $34,000, the average for a compact car is barely more than $20,000 and the average for a hybrid is only $25,000. The Model 3 will really be competing with compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class.\n\nCombined U.S. sales of those two models totaled more than 180,000 units in 2015. This segment is clearly much bigger than the large luxury car market where the Model S competes. Yet it's still a small fraction of the auto market. Moreover, Tesla may find it hard to win customers away from BMW and Mercedes with a car that \"won't have quite as many bells and whistles\" as the Model S.\n\nGM gets serious about electric cars\n\nOddly enough, the historically stodgy General Motors may have a better shot of winning in the mass market for electric vehicles. First of all, it will have a head start. It is on track to begin selling the Chevy Bolt -- an all-electric hatchback with at least 200 miles of range -- before the end of 2016. Early reviews for the Bolt have been quite positive.\n\nSecond, it is likely to hit a lower price point. General Motors probably will have sold about 100,000 tax-credit-eligible Chevy Volts in the U.S. by the time the Bolt goes on sale later this year. As a result, the federal tax credit probably won't start to phase out until at least 2019.\n\nSince GM should have the whole range of option packages available from day one (more or less), buyers will have plenty of time to get an entry-level Bolt and still qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit. Even with the Bolt's slightly higher $37,500 starting price, the result will be a cheaper car.\n\nThe Chevy Bolt will likely hit a lower price point than Tesla's Model 3. Image source: General Motors.\n\nFinally, I expect GM to be competitive on price. Discounts will likely be available (as is typical for mass-market cars), which is not true for Tesla vehicles. Furthermore, as costs come down, GM is likely to cut the starting price to grow the market. The original Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid had a sticker price of $41,000, whereas this year's model starts at just $33,170.\n\nIt's all about price\n\nI have no doubt that Tesla's Model 3 will be a very nice car, and it will probably outsell the Model S and Model X due to its lower price point. However, the price won't be low enough to really penetrate the mass market in a meaningful way.\n\nWhile the Model 3 will theoretically be available for less than $30,000 after tax credits, in practice GM is more likely to get a car below that key price point with the Chevy Bolt. In the mass market, where price is a key consideration, that may be GM's key to victory.", "Tesla has a new model and it is by far the most affordable. It doesn't have a Ludicrous Mode, nor can it go 440 kilometres on a single charge. But it certainly looks like a Tesla, and comes in 'authentic' Tesla colours complete with lithium-ion battery technology.\n\nThe Model S for Kids is a collaboration between Radio Flyer and Tesla Motors, and can be driven by one child aged 3 to 8 to a top speed of 10 km/h, which is slightly faster than the average Power Wheels car. The toy car comes with working headlights, a frunk (front trunk) and a sound system with a plug for a music player.

Musk contends the name sounds too much like his award-winning farm-to-table restaurants launched in 2004.\n\nThe similarity is a particular issue in the Midwest where Musk opened The Kitchen in Chicago in 2014, overlooking the river. When Puck's Grand Rapids location was announced at the end of 2014. customers bombarded Musk's team with emails asking about the company's expansion into Michigan.\n\n\"The confusion is extraordinary,\" Musk said. \"All I'm asking for is a very simple change.\"\n\nHe wants the restaurant's name changed to Wolfgang Puck's Kitchen, and a similar change made to The Kitchen Counter, also located at the Amway.\n\nA second The Kitchen By Wolfgang Puck is slated to open in Washington Dulles International Airport later this year.\n\nLast week, Musk's lawyers filed a notice with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office opposing the trademark applications Puck filed in April for The Kitchen by Wolfgang Puck and The Kitchen Counter by Wolfgang Puck, contending they infringe on Musk's three trademarks that include \"The Kitchen\" name.\n\nBy taking his disagreement public, Musk hopes to pressure Puck to sit down and talk with him to figure out a solution.\n\nPuck, through his attorney, declined comment for this story.\n\n\"We don't comment on pending litigation,\" said Joan Kupersmith Larkin, a partner at the Los Angeles office of law firm Seyfarth Shaw.\n\nNeither one of the immigrant entrepreneurs are backing down.\n\nPuck's food empire extends to a dozen restaurant concepts, cookbooks, cookware and packaged foods, while Musk, among his many entrepreneurial pursuits, is gaining a reputation in the farm-to-table movement.\n\nHe is the younger brother of billionaire and Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk, and sits on the board of Tesla and Space X.\n\nHis restaurants have a philanthropic arm, The Kitchen Community, a non-profit that connects 150,000 kids in Chicago, Denver, Memphis and Los Angeles with \"Learning Gardens.\" The more than 200 gardens in schools and community spaces are designed to let children in urban settings grow their own food as they learn healthy eating habits.\n\nFor Musk, his feud with Puck feels personal.\n\nMusk initially blamed the name issue on Puck's licensing team, and tried to resolve the dispute with a call to the chef. Instead of a callback, he received a note from a lawyer saying Puck had never heard of him.\n\n\"He knows me and my family pretty well,\" said Musk. \"He denied knowing me. It's a really, really strange action. Our family is pretty well-known in L.A. He has cooked for my brother and my mother at our houses.\"\n\nThe personal connection is why Musk said he reached out to Puck for restaurant advice in 2012, which was when a photo of the two was taken at Puck's iconic restaurant, Spago's in Beverly Hills.\n\n\"The meeting was very positive and he was listening very intently, and then he so bizarrely copied the brand,\" Musk said.\n\nMusk says Amway Grand Plaza Hotel leadership has been friendly to him, but have opted to stay on the sidelines of this legal tussle.\n\n\"We spoke to them and they weren't very happy about it and they were very open to changing the name to something like Wolfgang's Kitchen,\" Musk said.\n\nAmway Corp., which owns the posh down hotel, declined to comment for this story.\n\nWolfgang Puck visits Grand Rapids, wants patrons to be 'part of the family'\n\nThe confusion means Musk won't bring one of his restaurants to Grand Rapids, and replicate its efforts with the public school system.\n\n\"We have raised millions of dollars to support local schools,\" Musk said, referring to his Kitchen Community nonprofit. \"We just can't do that now in Grand Rapids and that's kind of a bummer for Grand Rapids.\"\n\nBoth Musk and Puck's Kitchen restaurants emphasize fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nIn many ways, Puck was an inspiration to him as one of the original pioneers of using the \"grow local\" movement.\n\n\"In Colorado, we are the largest buyer of local produce in the state, which is pretty amazing for a small restaurant group,\" said Musk, who lives in the Rocky Mountain state.\n\nThe group includes eight primarily Colorado restaurants that operate under the monikers The Kitchen and the Kitchen Next Door.\n\nLike his brother has disrupted the auto industry, Musk wants to transform the food space.

KIUC has a 20-year contract with SolarCity to buy the solar-generated electricity at a competitive price of 14.5 cents per kilowatt hour. SolarCity has chosen Tesla as its battery provider. The project now needs approval by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission.\n\nLast April, Musk unveiled a suite of batteries to store electricity for homes, businesses and utilities, marking Tesla's expansion beyond electric cars with battery technology that Musk said would \"fundamentally change the way the world uses energy.\" The equipment allows businesses and homeowners to store power, reducing the need to rely on utility grids for electricity.\n\nThe deal with SolarCity and KIUC gives some momentum for Tesla Energy, and Musk has said utility-scale deals could be 80 percent to 90 percent of sales for the business unit. The company's Powerwall battery, which can be installed in home garages, has generated enormous interest from consumers. But the bigger market is the larger Powerpack, which allows utilities to reduce the need for expensive facilities that only run during times of peak demand.\n\nSolarCity's deal also shows how Musk's two companies can link up to help each one find more business in two relatively nascent markets.\n\n\"Global excitement in Tesla Energy products remains very strong,\" said Tesla in its recent fourth-quarter letter to shareholders. \"To accommodate this demand, we transitioned production to the Gigafactory in Q4. While this transition did take slightly longer than we had expected, both Powerwall and Powerpack production is now operating smoothly and expanding at the Gigafactory.\"\n\nIn the utility industry, energy storage is finally coming of age. In Tesla's home state of California, a groundbreaking energy-storage mandate requires PG&E Corp., Edison International's Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric to collectively buy 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by the end of 2020.

The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nTesla introduces new solar batteries\n\nCEO Elon Musk presents Tesla'\u0080\u0099s new Powerwall solar batteries at an event in May 2015.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate - an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries - have surged 47 per cent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Two of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months among a Bloomberg Index of 2035 listed companies are developers of lithium materials operations. From 2015 to 2024, the market to supply lithium ion batteries for light vehicles may total $US221 billion ($310 billion), according to Navigant Consulting.\n\n'Step Change'\n\n\"There's a step change going on right now,\" as electric car sales rise and hybrid vehicles switch to lithium ion batteries, said Michael Fotios, executive chairman of General Mining, which is seeking to begin exports by July of the lithium-bearing mineral spodumene from Western Australia's Mt Cattlin project. \"Raw material supply hasn't kept pace, and probably can't keep pace with the projected demand.\"\n\nPerth-based General Mining, with a market value of $86 million, has seen its shares rise more than 1000 per cent since it announced a plan in February 2015 to resume production at the previously shuttered Mt Cattlin. Pilbara Minerals, with a market value of $286 million, is accelerating development of its Pilgangoora project in Western Australia and forecasts production from about 2018. The company has advanced about 1200 per cent since it acquired the site in July 2014.\n\nGreenbushes, the world's largest spodumene mine, is also located in Western Australia and owned by the Talison joint venture between China's Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group and Albemarle Corp, the world's biggest lithium producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLithium carbonate's price gains will extend to 2017 on weak supply, while demand is likely to soar 64 per cent by 2020 from 2015 levels, Citigroup forecasts. This rising demand is intensifying a race to deliver new sources of lithium raw materials, spurring gains for developers poised to enter production before the end of the decade.\n\nChina is targeting the goal of five million electric vehicles on its roads by 2020, under President Xi Jinping's strategic initiative to upgrade the nation's auto industry. Nissan and Renault SA said this month that sales of battery- powered vehicles rose to a record last year, while Volkswagen's Audi plans to start building its first purely electric sport utility vehicle in 2018.\n\n\"The demand in vehicles, electric bikes, trucks and buses is going to be enormous, and the electric storage market is also going to be significant,\" said Neil Biddle, executive director of Perth-based Pilbara Minerals, which holds the world's second- biggest deposit of spodumene. Prices of spodumene have jumped to about $US480 a tonne this year from around $US380 a tonne in 2014, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nLithium products used in batteries come from three sources: hard rock mining of mineral ores including spodumene; battery recycling; and the evaporation of brine from salt ponds, the technique that has historically dominated production. While hard rock miners such as General Mining and Pilbara Minerals are higher cost than brine projects, they have lower capital spending needs and are quicker to production, making them the best placed to exploit surging prices, according to Foster Stockbroking.\n\nThe cheapest source of lithium is brine and the biggest reserves are in Chile, where companies such as Albemarle and Sociedad Quimica & Minera de Chile SA harness the sun and the world's driest desert to evaporate brine from ponds.

This project has been dubbed 'Titan'.\n\nThis Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away - and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive.\n\nApple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago.\n\nThe Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto\n\nThese reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'\n\nThe claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee.\n\nIn an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car.\n\nAn unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California\n\nIn particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software\n\nPUBLIC COULD HAVE SELF-DRIVING CARS IN TWO YEARS\n\nThe head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years.\n\nChris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nBut Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly.\n\nHe told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars.\n\nHe told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.'\n\nAlternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software.\n\nThe original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco.\n\nThe blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple.\n\nLast year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans.\n\nWhen contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was.\n\nWith 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right)\n\nAlternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)", "Sidney Perkowitz on The Technological Singularity and Machines of Loving Grace : The Quest for Common Ground Between Humans and Robots\n\nIF YOU THINK the main existential threat facing humanity is climate change or global food shortages, think again. A number of eminent scientists and technologists believe a bigger threat is the rise of powerful artificial intelligences (AI). They argue that these intelligences will dominate or replace humanity. \"We are summoning the demon,\" Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, recently said. \"We should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I were to guess, like, what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that.\" Bill Gates shares these concerns, and Stephen Hawking put it apocalyptically when he told the BBC, \"the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\"\n\nOthers profoundly disagree. Eric Horvitz, who directs Microsoft's Redmond Research Lab -- heavily involved in AI -- thinks losing control of the technology \"isn't going to happen.\" According to him, \"we'll be able to get incredible benefits from machine intelligence in all realms of life, from science to education to economics to daily life.\"\n\nOf course, countless science fiction works have portrayed imagined machine beings, such as HAL in Stanley Kubrick's 2001. The classic film Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970) portrays an AI running amok and ruling humanity. The conceit has obviously become a popular generator of fictional plots. But Musk and the others are talking about the real world, our world. The pressing question becomes: Should we panic?\n\nOr should we just accept defeat and hope our machine overlords won't be too brutal? Or, in a more hopeful mood, look to a golden age mediated by kindly superintelligences? Or, in a more indifferent one, file all these comments under \"techno overhype\" and go about our business?\n\n\u00a4\n\nSeveral recent books offer answers of a sort by examining the rise of the machine mind. Author of The Technological Singularity, Murray Shanahan is a professor at Imperial College London, where he conducts research on AI and robotics. Steeped since childhood in science fiction, he sees the value of the genre in presenting novel ideas -- in the manner, for instance, of last year's robot film Ex Machina, for which he was a scientific advisor. His new book explores scenarios about the future of AI in somewhat similar fashion.\n\nAI, he explains, can lead to a \"technological singularity,\" a critical moment for humanity popularized by the futurist Ray Kurzweil, among others, who predicted it would arrive by the mid-21st century. The first person to call this event a \"singularity\" was the distinguished 20th-century mathematician John von Neumann, who thought breakneck technological progress would take us to \"some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\"\n\nThis may read like science fiction, but Shanahan points out that the idea is potentially meaningful for AI because AI is inherently dangerous. It can produce an unpredictable feedback loop: \"When the thing being engineered is intelligence itself, the very thing doing the engineering, it can set to work improving itself. Before long, according to the singularity hypothesis, the ordinary human is removed from the loop.\"\n\nShanahan's tour of AI begins with the famous Turing test, developed from a seminal paper in 1950 by the British mathematician and World War II codebreaker Alan Turing. He predicted that machines would one day think well enough that a human interlocutor could not distinguish between a person and a machine. The \"Turing test\" criterion has yet to be met, but Shanahan suggests it's only a matter of time; in fact, he sketches out exactly how to build AIs possessing this and other \"general intelligence\" abilities.\n\nOne route to AI, \"whole brain emulation,\" Shanahan explains, depends on the proposition that \"human behavior is determined by physical processes in the brain.\" There are \"no causal mysteries, no missing links, in the (immensely complicated) chain of causes and effects that leads from what we see, hear, and touch to what we do and say.\" In a human brain, the chain is built within 80 billion connected neurons, each taking nerve impulses as input and producing other impulses as output, which in turn activate other neurons. Shanahan's position is that we can build a brain by replicating those neurons with digital electronic elements in silicon chips. Some of us might object that what goes on in a human brain is more than what we see externally in a person's behavior. After all, we absolutely do not understand how and why neurons firing in the brain produce our individual internal realities: our sense of self or \"consciousness.\" But setting aside that pesky issue, it is scientifically valid to propose that intelligence as manifested by behavior can be replicated by copying the brain behind the behavior.\n\nShanahan argues that the obstacles to building such a brain are technological, not conceptual. A whole human brain is more than we can yet copy, but we can copy one a thousand times smaller. That is, we are on our way, because existing digital technology could simulate the 70 million neurons in a mouse brain. If we can also map these neurons, then, according to Shanahan, it is only a matter of time before we can obtain a complete blueprint for an artificial mouse brain. Once that brain is built, Shanahan believes it would \"kick-start progress toward human-level AI.\" We'd need to simulate billions of neurons of course, and then qualitatively \"improve\" the mouse brain with refinements like modules for language, but Shanahan thinks we can do both through better technology that deals with billions of digital elements and our rapidly advancing understanding of the workings of human cognition. To be sure, he recognizes that this argument relies on unspecified future breakthroughs.\n\nBut if we do manage to construct human-level AIs, Shanahan believes they would \"almost inevitably\" produce a next stage -- namely, superintelligence -- in part because an AI has big advantages over its biological counterpart. With no need to eat and sleep, it can operate nonstop; and, with its impulses transmitted electronically in nanoseconds rather than electrochemically in milliseconds, it can operate ultra-rapidly. Add the ability to expand and reproduce itself in silicon, and you have the seed of a scarily potent superintelligence.\n\nNaturally, this raises fears of artificial masterminds generating a disruptive singularity. According to Shanahan, such fears are valid because we do not know how superintelligences would behave: \"whether they will be friendly or hostile [...] predictable or inscrutable [...] whether conscious, capable of empathy or suffering.\" This will depend on how they are constructed and the \"reward function\" that motivates them. Shanahan concedes that the chances of AIs turning monstrous are slim, but, because the stakes are so high, he believes we must consider the possibility.\n\n\u00a4\n\nThe singularity also appears in journalist John Markoff's Machines of Loving Grace (the title is from a Richard Brautigan poem), but only as a small part of a larger narrative about AI. John Markoff has written about technology, science, and computing for The New York Times since 1988, covering IBM-style mainframes to today's breakthroughs. From his base in San Francisco, he is well connected to Silicon Valley, and Machines of Loving Grace draws on Markoff's intimate knowledge of the research and researchers that form the AI enterprise. He begins with early AI work in the 1960s, which did not yield immediate success despite overly optimistic predictions. Same story in the 1980s. Signs of progress finally appeared around 1999, in products with rudimentary intelligence like Roomba, a vacuum cleaner that navigated itself around a house to suck up dirt; and Sony's Aibo, a mechanically cute robot dog that also autonomously navigated and responded to voice commands. Though not as smart as a two-year-old toddler or even a real dog, these devices possessed a sliver of general intelligence insofar as they could adapt to their environments in real time.\n\nEarly AI pioneers had differing notions of the relationship between intelligent machines and people. The Stanford computer scientist John McCarthy, who had coined the phrase \"artificial intelligence,\" believed he could artificially emulate all human abilities (and do so within a decade). In contrast, Douglas Engelbart, a visionary engineer who had invented the computer mouse, worked on intelligent machines that would enhance human abilities to address the world's problems -- an approach he called IA, \"intelligence augmentation.\" In other words, as Markoff puts it: \"One researcher attempted to replace human beings with intelligent machines [...] the other aimed to extend human capabilities.\" \"Their work,\" he therefore argues, \"defined both a dichotomy and a paradox.\" The paradox is that \"the same technologies that extend the intellectual power of humans can displace them as well.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Markoff reports, AI research has produced commercial products that display both human extension and human displacement. One of them is speech recognition, which you encounter whenever you call your bank to get an account balance, or ask a question of Siri or Alexa, the personal assistants from Apple and Amazon, respectively. This will be important in satisfying the Turing test, and Siri and Alexa are examples of IA helping people manage their lives. On the other hand, Google's self-driving car, which can more or less safely navigate complex environments, eliminates the human driver.\n\nThese are not full human-level AIs -- nor potential rogue superintelligences. They are merely steps in that direction.\n\nEven if a singularity never actually happens, AI is already having serious social and economic effects. Markoff points out that robots have been taking over industrial jobs on auto assembly lines and elsewhere for decades. Now, with practicable AI, \"workplace automation has started to strike the white-collar workforce with the same ferocity that it transformed the factory floor.\" Professionals such as doctors and airline pilots are not immune either.\n\nBut the option of IA, enhancement rather than replacement, makes it less likely that digital intelligences will dominate. Faith in pure AI does not come easily; when Markoff rides in a self-driving auto at 60 miles per hour, he finds it nerve-racking to \"trust the car.\" People would likely get over this fear, but Markoff also notes that some surprisingly intricate situations can arise. At a four-way stop sign, drivers typically glance at each other to make sure each is following the rule \"first in, first out.\" With self-driving cars, separate AIs would have to coordinate their actions, adding a hugely complicating layer of intercommunication technology to the process. Maybe the better answer is to keep people in the driver's seat, supported by IA in the form of smart sensors and software that make it easier and safer to drive.\n\nIn other applications, replacing people by synthetic versions might seem inhumane. With rising numbers of the elderly in the United States and Europe and a shortage of caregivers, some observers propose using robots instead. But would anyone want to be tended by machines? They might look human and display intelligence along with seeming compassion and \"loving grace,\" but could they feel the \"real\" emotions that people want from truly involved caregivers? Calling the prospect \"disturbing,\" Markoff suggests that we instead use IA to extend our ability to provide medical care, companionship, and better quality of life to the ill and elderly in human, person-to-person ways.\n\n\u00a4\n\nTaken together, the two books provide an overview of AI. They raise more questions than they answer, but that is to be expected. Both authors explain technical material lucidly with relatable examples. Their coverage sometimes overlaps, but their books are different. Shanahan's book is a compact (272 pages in a small format) science-based summary of the background and state of the AI art, with enough detail for the reader to grasp what is feasible, now and maybe later. At 400 pages, Markoff's book has less scientific detail but adds a rich story about the roots of AI and the people behind it, and its place in our daily world.\n\nBut back to the original question: Will AI lead to either an existential threat or an earthly paradise? Should we panic? While Markoff mentions the AI singularity, he is really interested in the less shattering effects AI has already had. Shanahan tells us how superintelligence might develop, but gives little reason to think this will happen in our lifetime.\n\nFor now, we are in charge of our machines. Shanahan tells us \"we must decide what to do with the technology\"; Markoff reminds us that the discussion of AI vs. IA is really about the \"kind of world we will create.\"\n\nIf we end up in Hell rather than Heaven, this time it will be our own fault. Regardless, there's no need to panic quite yet.", "If you want more of something, mandate it, subsidize it and exempt it from regulations. If you want less of something, punish it with taxes and regulations. Put more bluntly, the power to tax and regulate is the power to destroy. This is the First Rule of Government.\n\nNo presidency has ever come close to the Obama Administration in employing the rule to advance its ideologies and agendas. No industry has been so favored as renewable energy over the past seven years. No sector has been so thoroughly vilified and subjugated as fossil fuels during that period.\n\nThankfully, Congress refused to impose a cap-tax-and-trade regime on carbon-based energy and U.S. jobs, families, economic growth and living standards. However, EPA and other Obama agencies simply replaced unsuccessful legislative initiatives with regulations, often employing highly innovative statutory interpretations to justify its actions - and courts too often bowed to this \"agency discretion.\"\n\nNowhere was this more heavy-handed and destructive than in the coal and climate change arena, where a regulatory tidal wave inundated mines, power plants, companies, families, communities and entire states. Other EPA and Interior Department rules blocked leasing, drilling, fracking and other energy activities on millions of acres of government-administered lands, onshore and off, and even on state and private land.\n\nThanks to determined efforts by state attorneys general and other parties, however, a number of these regulations were stymied in courts of law. Nowhere was this more important than this week's Supreme Court decision to block implementation of President Obama's Clean Power Plan while lower courts consider some 30 lawsuits over its legality, state sovereignty, the scope of agency discretion in interpreting and rewriting federal laws, and the plan's effects on energy, jobs, health and welfare.\n\nThat means this noxious regulation will be \"vacated\" for the remainder of Obama's presidency.\n\nThe president, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and their allies are not happy. They promise to charge ahead with their \"fundamental transformation\" of the United States, via other tactics and edicts.\n\nThe oil patch is one of the few industries that kept the Obama economy (and presidency) afloat - primarily because of fracking, which slipped in under the EPA/environmentalist radar but is now under constant attack by Interior and Big Green. It created millions of jobs, channeled billions of dollars to local, state and federal treasuries, brought gasoline prices below $2 per gallon, and saved American families billions: every penny not spent on gasoline puts $1 billion a year back into our pockets.\n\nSo how does Obama intend to repay the industry, now that it has fallen on hard times? Amid a sluggish global economy and record oil and gas production, oil prices have plunged below $30 a barrel - forcing the oil patch to lay people off, many companies to retrench or ponder bankruptcy, and many communities to confront reduced employment, consumer spending, real estate values, and revenues.\n\nBut as part of his last-gasp, $4.1-trillion, $503-billion-deficit 2017 federal budget, the president wants Congress to slap a $10.25 tax on every barrel of domestically produced or imported oil. He says this will raise some $400 billion over the next ten years.\n\nThis will allow him to increase EPA's budget to $8.3 billion, pour $1.7 billion a year into the \"climate fund,\" and channel hundreds of billions into high speed rail, wind, solar, biofuel, \"eco-friendly\" cars and other \"green\" energy schemes. It thus means more opportunities for unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to pick winners and losers, expand their fiefdoms, and pad their bonuses and pensions.\n\nThankfully, the proposal is \"dead on arrival\" in Congress. Enough members understand (even if the president does not) that this tax will not be \"paid for by the oil companies.\" It will only be collected by oil companies - and then passed along to every American family and business, in the form of higher gasoline prices and higher costs for everything produced or transported using petroleum: food, clothing, plastics, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, housing, healthcare, and countless other products and services. Even ethanol and other biofuels require petroleum, as do organic food and electric cars.\n\nMr. Obama, however, sees additional advantages to a 35% oil tax. It lets him stigmatize Big Oil yet again.\n\nIt advances his goal of ending our \"addiction\" to fossil fuels that still provide 82% of US and 87% of global energy - because they are the most abundant, reliable, affordable energy sources available today; because they sustain modern economies and living standards, and help lift billions out of poverty and disease. Would Obama also have us end our \"addiction\" to food, shelter and human companionship?\n\nAn oil tax would also help him promote the climate treaty he signed in Paris. The Supreme Court's slap-down of EPA's plans to regulate fossil fuels into oblivion means the United States is far less likely to implement the president's unilateral commitment to the accord's emission reduction demands (and massive wealth transfers, via climate \"adaptation and reparation\" payments) - even assuming the Senate ultimately approves the treaty, under its \"advice and consent\" authority. That in turn means developed and developing nations alike are even less likely to slash their CO2 emissions, carbon-based energy use, economic growth and living standards, for no progress in controlling nature-driven climate change.\n\nFinally, all that devoutly wished for tax revenue would enable Mr. Obama to repay his debts to crony corporatist friends like Elon Musk. His Tesla Motors company continues to hemorrhage investor money despite massive infusions of taxpayer cash in the form of CO2 rules, subsidies, loans, $7,500 tax credits per car purchased, and free charging stations, so that the wealthiest 1.0 or 0.1 percent will buy the pricey cars. In 2015 alone, Tesla lost another $889 million, on revenues of $4.05 billion.\n\nWe've come to expect this from President Obama. Equally depressing, we also expect it from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, former DemoRepublican candidate-in-waiting Michael Bloomberg, most of today's Democratic politicians, too many Republican pols, most government \"public servants,\" and certainly those who are \"feeling the Bern\" or think \"there's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women\" by voting for a certain candidate. (Hint: Ms. Albright didn't mean Carly or Sarah.)\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton wants to have a half billion more solar panels deployed during her first four years in office, \"enough clean energy to power every home\" in America, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $200 billion a year. Plus free education, free universal healthcare, and more. Senator Sanders doubtless agrees.\n\nIt is a sad, painful assessment of their economic literacy - and of our high schools, colleges, business communities and politicians' ability to empower students and voters through economic literacy, a grasp of socialism's abject failures and horrid excesses, and an appreciation of free enterprise capitalism's incomparable record of improving the health, living standards and prospects of billions.\n\nIt's also a sad commentary on liberal-progressive \"climate justice\" and \"compassion\" for coal mine, power plant and oil patch workers and families who have been pummeled by their policies - and for poor, minority and blue collar families that would be hit hardest by the Obama oil tax. Those families pay a far larger share of their incomes on energy, food, clothing and other necessities than do Barack, Hillary and Michael's upper-crust friends, Bernie's Wall Street benefactors, or even middle class families:\n\nFamilies making less than $30,000 a year spend 26% of their after-tax income on energy, while families that make over $50,000 a year spend only 8% - and those in upper 1% spend only a fraction of 1 percent.\n\nWere President Obama to succeed on his oil tax, \"stop climate change\" and \"leave all fossil fuels in the ground\" agenda, his \"legacy\" would be making tens of millions more Americans jobless, energy deprived and impoverished - and keeping billions beyond our borders mired in abject poverty, disease, malnutrition and despair.

He is a complex figure, unsurprisingly, who does not suffer fools easily and who not only wants to land people on Mars, but also to create a new human society there. As he puts it, \"I want to die on Mars, just not on impact.\" This article reviews a new biography on Musk that traces his roots and his reach, titled Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.\n\nAshlee Vance's new book, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, takes readers on a thorough and fascinating trek through the life -- so far -- of one of the most impressive contemporary American \"Engineering Entrepreneurs,\" from his birth in South Africa to his emigration to Canada as a teen, to the United States, where he completed college and went on to Silicon Valley.\n\nMusk quickly earned his initial millions when his first company, Zip2, was bought out, then a fortune at PayPal. He came to the brink of vaporizing almost all of his money in a quest to build an electric car and meet a host of other ambitious goals, including putting satellites in orbit, supplying the international space station, laying the groundwork and developing the technology for the colonization of Mars.\n\nIt should be said upfront: This is not hagiography; Musk is represented as neither saint nor savior. It is biography -- shot through with relevant strands of financial, technical and cultural history. The distinction is important, and Vance is particularly well credentialed -- both on the tech side and on the business side -- to \"lead the tour.\" He also did hundreds of interviews, and he spent thirty hours with Musk himself. For the most part, that shines through.\n\nOut of Africa\n\nVance starts before the beginning, going back to Musk's grandparents and beyond.\n\nMusk was born in Pretoria, about an hour away from Johannesburg, in 1971, to a Canadian mother and an Afrikaner father. In an interesting overlap, Vance was born in South Africa in 1977, although he grew up, for the most part, in Texas. On his father's side, Musk's family roots in South Africa go back several generations. His parents divorced when he was young; he was first in the custody of his mother, then of his father.\n\nMusk's father is a rare \"no go\" research area: Neither Elon nor anyone else in the family will talk about the ways in which he was a scarring -- though by no means exclusively negative -- influence. This is all the more chilling given the unsparingly intense descriptions we get of Musk's childhood.\n\n\"Bullied\" is a word we hear often. Still, the descriptions of the violence Musk endured as a child, however, are disturbing. In eighth or ninth grade, for example, he was attacked by a group of boys, kicked in the head, thrown down a flight of concrete stairs, then set upon on the landing, kicked and beaten bloody until he blacked out. He required hospital care -- and a week at home to recover.\n\nPart of the \"explanation\" for this is that, for Afrikaners, South Africa under Apartheid, was a \"hyper-masculine\" culture, in which physical prowess was seen as an existential necessity. Elon, by way of contrast, was the boy who -- when he had exhausted the resources of his school library -- literally read the encyclopedia. He also remembered what he read, and spouted facts, statistics and explanations whenever anyone in his general vicinity launched a question.\n\n\"Those early Silicon Valley experiences ... gave Musk both the capital and the contacts that he was able to use as a springboard for his more ambitious projects.\"\n\nHe left South Africa for good at 17. Why? As elsewhere, Vance lays out the options evenhandedly, both the surface explanations and the other possibilities, and lets the reader be the judge: Laws had changed, allowing his mother to \"pass down\" her Canadian citizenship to her children; Elon was on the cusp of being drafted into the South African army; he had America in his sights and Canada as the optimal gateway.\n\nEarly Valley Days\n\nMusk went first to Queens University in Kingston, on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, about 165 miles east of Toronto. After two years there he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing joint bachelor's degrees -- one in physics, the other, via Wharton, in economics.\n\nHe apparently shared some of his undergraduate papers with Vance, on topics like space-based solar power plants and the use of ultra-capacitors for energy storage, keen to demonstrate that his interests were longstanding and consistent, that his goal had always been to make a difference, independent of the question of making a fortune.\n\nVance underlines the degree to which Musk's dual-track undergraduate years were obviously reflected in his thinking, even in his early 20s.\n\n\"Musk's clear, concise writing,\" Vance tells us, \"is the work of a logician, moving from one point to the next with precision. What truly stood out, though, was Musk's ability to master difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then, he showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a scientific advance to a for-profit enterprise.\"\n\nThat \"knack\" would be crucial to Musk's business accomplishments. The successful development and commercialization of the Tesla electric cars, for example, came about in significant part because he recognized that advances in lithium ion batteries had changed the weight/power/range/cost equation that had defeated most previous efforts. There were softer skills, more human equations, however, that he would need to work on.\n\nMusk spent his two \"Penn summers\" in part in internships in Silicon Valley -- not always one at a time. On graduation, he and his brother Kimbal headed west and settled there. Together they would launch Zip2, Musk's first company, which would essentially end up pushing him aside for more \"mature\" management -- which is not to say that he didn't profit from the experience, in every meaning of the word. Something similar happened with the company that would become PayPal, which provided an even greater payoff.\n\nAs presented by Vance, those early Silicon Valley experiences did a number of things: they gave Musk both the capital and the contacts that he was able to use as a springboard for his more ambitious projects; they gave him an early, and somewhat traumatic, introduction to corporate infighting which bred a strong impulse going forward to make sure that he kept control of his companies; and they taught him at least limited lessons in how to be an effective -- if hard-driving -- manager.\n\nSome of the \"management learning\" has about it the air of an anthropologist trying to figure out a foreign culture.\n\n\"I could code way better,\" Musk says of the software engineers at Zip2. \"And I'd just go in and fix their [expletive] code. . . I would be frustrated waiting for their stuff, so I'm going to go and fix your code and now it runs five times faster, you idiot.\"\n\n\"When considering if Musk's aim of going to Mars is credible or hype, there is Musk's track record to consider.\"\n\nHe cites another example, in which he publicly chastised, and then corrected, an engineer who had miswritten a quantum mechanics equation.\n\n\"I'm like, 'how can you write that?' Then I corrected it for him. He hated me after that. Eventually, I realized, okay, I might have fixed that thing but now I've made the person unproductive. It just wasn't a good way to go about things.\"\n\nIt's worth underlining that Musk did not say, \"made an enemy\" or \"hurt the feelings of a subordinate.\" The lesson he extrapolated was that to completely ignore how other people felt was inefficient.\n\nIron Man\n\nThe triumvirate of companies most dear to Musk and with which he is most closely associated is made up of: Tesla Motors, which produces electric cars; SolarCity, which produces electricity -- some of which feeds free fueling stations for Tesla owners; and SpaceX, a private company with the not-entirely-low-key aim of making humanity a multi-planetary species -- the likely first step in that direction being the colonization of Mars. The road to making those companies viable enterprises has been, predictably, rocky.\n\n\"Musk has consistently brought clarity to bear on both the engineering problems and the financial hurdles that have heretofore kept humankind earthbound.\"\n\nIn early 2007, the actor Robert Downey Jr. visited the SpaceX factory. Musk gave him a personal tour. Downey, in turn, modeled some core parts of his Tony Stark character -- the techno-billionaire who suits up to battle evil as Iron Man -- on Musk, going as far as to ask that a Tesla Roadster, not yet available to the public, sit next to Stark's desk.\n\nThe year 2008, however, was an annus horribilis for Musk, both personally and financially. His first marriage ended; he came perilously close to losing just about every penny he had earned; both Tesla and SpaceX were on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n\"I've just never seen anything like [Musk's] ability to take pain,\" Vance quotes Antonio Gracias -- a friend of Musk's, an investor in both Tesla and SpaceX, founder and CEO of Valor [Equity Partners] -- as saying, which sounds less like a description of an engineer or an entrepreneur, more the kind of descriptive applied to someone in extreme sports.\n\nIn May of that year, the \"Truth About Cars\" website began a \"Tesla Deathwatch.\" In June, Musk filed for divorce. In August, the SpaceX Falcon I had its third disastrous launch failure -- taking a U.S. Air Force satellite down in flames with it. Then in October, (tech industry gossip site) Valleywag released a scathing attack on Musk in general (not its first), and on Tesla in particular.\n\nThere were a few, crucial, bright spots, as well. In July, Musk met Tallulah Riley, a British actress 14 years his junior who would end up being his second wife. September saw the fourth (and finally successful) launch of the Falcon I and -- most important of all on the business side -- the holiday season brought a last-minute financial reprieve.\n\n\"The deal,\" Vance writes, a lifesaving infusion of capital, \"ended up closing on Christmas Eve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt. Musk had just a few hundred thousand dollars left and could not have made payroll the next day. Musk eventually put in $12 million, and the investment firms put up the rest.\"\n\n\"You Are Also Wrong\"\n\nMusk is the kind of subject who puts writers in a quandary: Some people talk about him -- he sometimes talks about himself -- in Messianic terms; others take a dimmer view -- though more in the spheres of finance and personality than in the realm of science and engineering. How is one to present readers with a simulacrum of the truth?\n\nFirst and foremost, Vance notes that Musk is not a purveyor of vaporware, the Silicon Valley term for a \"visionary\" product, usually software, which exists only in the perpetual future. When considering if Musk's aim of going to Mars is credible or hype, there is Musk's track record to consider.\n\nPrevious electric cars had failed in part because of power limitations -- and the resultant \"range anxiety.\" Musk assessed the improved state of battery technology, improved it further, and built a marketable product. Solar power -- even with state and federal subsidies and the falling cost of solar panels -- had proven a difficult sell, particularly around the issue of up-front investment. Musk was a key part of developing a new model in which the installer took on those costs, reaped the rebate benefits, and made \"getting into solar\" both technically seamless and financially painless for the end user.\n\nBoeing, Lockheed-Martin, and the other aerospace \"incumbents\" were tangled up in bureaucratic procedures and inflated costs. SpaceX showed that they could cut expenses by as much as 90% and still \"get the job done.\"\n\nAnother strength of Vance's book is healthy skepticism. Within Silicon Valley, he writes in the first few pages, Musk was \"a deity.\" But outside this \"warped version of reality,\" he continues, \"Musk often comes off as a more polarizing figure. He's the guy with the electric cars, solar panels and rockets peddling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P.T. Barnum ... I'd long been a subscriber to this latter camp. Musk had struck me as a well-intentioned dreamer -- a card-carrying member of Silicon Valley's techno-utopian club.\"\n\nTo his credit, Vance provides a good deal of primary source documentation -- as in Musk's own ruminations about the evolution of his \"management style.\" Readers can also dig through the appendices and make their own judgments. In Appendix III, for example, we get the full text (several pages) of an email Musk sent to all of the employees at SpaceX, many of whom were evincing dissatisfaction that the company was in no great hurry to go public -- which limited the value of options employees had .. on a stock that did not yet exist.\n\n\"Some at SpaceX who have not been through a public company experience may think that being public is desirable,\" Musk wrote, on June 7, 2013. \"This is not so.... For those who are under the impression that they are so clever that they can outsmart public market investors and would sell SpaceX stock 'at the right time,' let me relieve you of any such notion... If you think 'Ah, but I know what's really going on at SpaceX and that will give me an edge,' you are also wrong.\"\n\nMusk writes well. He anticipates and understands the questions he needs to address; he gathers and presents information cogently. It is not that anything that he writes is nasty exactly -- it's more a matter of tone -- perhaps best described as that of a patient but exasperated parent, willing to provide a full and calm answer, not trying to rush or scant his response, working with reasonable success to maintain a degree of civility.\n\nThe Unified Field Theory of Elon Musk\n\n\"Bringing it all together\" at the end provides a good overview and synthesis. Vance's titling the final chapter as he did (above) is witty, given Musk's lifelong affinity for physics.\n\nWhen Vance maps out the connections between Musk's various ventures -- SpaceX, Solar City, Tesla Motors, the intersections between technologies and the ways in which the totality of Musk's career has a clear nexus, we believe him because he has meticulously laid the groundwork and shown us the evidence in the preceding 350-plus pages.\n\nIn that sense, Vance's comparison of Musk to Thomas Edison -- or to Nikola Tesla -- is fair: All had vision. Musk has, irrefutably, done things that have not been done before. Never mind anything else: He founded, ran, carried, goaded and nurtured a company that built rockets from scratch and put them into orbit, then sent them further on to the International Space Station. In previous human history, countries have done that, not companies. And other entrepreneurs, other companies, have vaporized fortunes in attempts to achieve that same goal -- a fate to which, as Vance documents, Musk came perilously close. Yet, it did not ultimately slow him down all that much.\n\nThe first line of the book, Vance quoting Musk, is \"Do you think I'm insane?\" The last paragraph of the book (before the after-matter), drawn from Vance's \"Last Supper\" with Musk, includes the quoted line: \"I'd like to die on Mars,\" along with an important codicil, \"Just not on impact\u2009Twitter ,\" because physics is a precise \"business.\" That final line would be insane, had Vance not taken readers on the journey that gets us there.\n\nWill Musk get to Mars? Will humanity? While both are open questions as of this writing, Vance does a good job of explicating and illuminating why and how Musk -- the bullied and beaten South African know-it-all adolescent; the scientific savant with his secondary bachelor's degree in business from Wharton; the tyrannical boss (almost always unfiltered, frequently limning the edges of unhinged) who inspires both stunned exasperation and fierce loyalty from his colleagues and from his workforce -- might be the person to actually achieve that goal.\n\n\"The scientists of today,\" Nikola Tesla wrote around the turn of the last century, \"think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.\"\n\nVance credibly makes the case that -- however fantastical his dreams -- Musk has consistently brought clarity to bear on both the engineering problems and the financial hurdles that have heretofore kept humankind earthbound.", "Tesla Motors now owns something its top executives have likely coveted for years: the Tesla.com domain name, which as of Thursday redirects web browsers to the company's existing web address, Teslamotors.com.\n\nThe move comes as Tesla is expanding into energy storage and gives the company a domain that can encapsulate both segments of its business. It also nabs the more popular internet search term, which is the last name of the 19th century inventor from which the electric car producer gets its name.\n\nThe Palo Alto maker of the Model S and Model X luxury electric vehicles has been around for nearly 13 years, but it's taken this long for the company to acquire the domain name, largely because it's been registered privately since 1992, years before the internet took hold.\n\nAccording to a whois record at DomainTools, the domain was transferred to Tesla Motors Tuesday and had previously been owned by Stu Grossman, a computer network engineer in California, who may have also been the original registrant. The domain pointed to a website informing visitors that the domain was \"parked by owner,\" according to a Tesla Motors news site that viewed the domain before it was changed over.\n\nA phone number attributed to Grossman was not answered, but according to a legal complaint, he had fought a previous attempt to give up the domain name.\n\nIn 2005, Tesla Industries, a maker of power conversions systems, argued that Grossman's use of the domain constituted a \"confusingly similar\" trademark and a \"bad faith\" registration. In other words, it accused Grossman of cybersquatting, the practice of holding domain names hostage to companies or individuals.\n\nGrossman successfully argued in front of a trademark arbitration forum that the domain was used solely for sending and receiving email on his server and was not interested in selling the address.\n\nApparently Grossman changed his mind. Whether money changed hands is unknown, but it's likely. Facebook paid the American Farm Bureau Federation $8.5 million for the rights to fb.com in 2011 while Apple forked over $4.5 million for icloud.com from a Swedish cloud computing firm in the same year.\n\nIn 2013, Tesla confronted a genuine \"trademark troll\" in China, in which a local self-proclaimed electric car entrepreneur claimed the China-registered Tesla domain name, the company's T-shaped logo and font and the preferred Chinese transliteration of the company's name in Mandarin. Tesla eventually won its right to its own trademarks in China but was forced to use an alternative transliteration of its name in the local alphabet than the one it preferred.", "* Lead batteries still dominate power storage market\n\n* Saft depreciates lithium-ion plants as earnings lag (Adds CEO comments on lithium-ion, Tesla)\n\nBy Geert De Clercq\n\nPARIS, Feb 18 Saft's 2015 net profit plunged 72 percent as a slower than expected switch to lithium-ion batteries forced the French battery maker to take a writedown on its factories.\n\nSaft said many of its industrial and utility customers were sticking with lead batteries longer than it had expected and that lead still accounted for more than 80 percent of the battery market.\n\n\"Energy storage was the disappointment of 2015,\" Saft chief executive Ghislain Lescuyer said on an earnings call.\n\nHe said the adoption of lithium-ion batteries by its clients is proceeding more slowly than the firm had expected and that it therefore reduced the accounting value of its Jacksonville, United States, and Nersac, France, lithium-ion battery plants.\n\nThe two plants' combined 2015 losses rose to 21.3 million euros ($24 million), from 13.1 million in 2014 and Lescuyer said it would probably take another two or three years before they became profitable.\n\nLithium-ion batteries perform better than lead-based batteries, but the aviation, automotive and other industries are switching more slowly than anticipated to the new technology.\n\nLescuyer said U.S.-based Tesla Motors - which last year unveiled a move into battery systems for homes, companies and utilities - is not in the same market segment as Saft, as it is more focused on the consumer market.\n\nSaft specialises in high-tech nickel- and lithium-based batteries for the defence and space industries. Lescuyer said a price war on the lithium-ion market also hurt its business.\n\n\"It is clear that big, low-cost Asian players have bought market share,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Boeing's global 787 fleet was grounded for months after two lithium-ion batteries burned out in separate incidents, which caused some planemakers to switch back to nickel-cadmium batteries.\n\nSaft saw 2015 core earnings rise 6.2 percent to 110.4 million euros as revenue rose 1.9 percent to 759.4 million.\n\nNet earnings dropped to 13.6 million euros due to 35.9 million euros of impairments on its lithium-ion assets and costs related to its restructuring plan announced in November.\n\nSaft gave no 2016 earnings guidance because of what it said is a volatile and uncertain economic environment, but confirmed medium-term objectives for revenue over 900 million euros and a margin of at least 16 percent by 2019.\n\nShares in Saft, whose market value is 580 million euros, are down 35 percent over the past nine months.

The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate -- an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries -- have surged 47 percent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence Ltd.\n\nTwo of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months among a Bloomberg Index of 2,035 listed companies are developers of lithium materials operations.

Cattlin project.\n\n\"Raw material supply hasn't kept pace, and probably can't keep pace with the projected demand.\"", "Investors can get exposure to lithium through an ETF or directly with companies that produce it or use it to make batteries. (Getty Images)\n\nSince discovering lithium in the 1800s, people have found lots of uses for the soft, silver-white metal: lubricants, psychiatric medications and even as the title for one of the most popular songs by grunge rock band Nirvana. For investors, perhaps the most interesting use for lithium is in the burgeoning battery sector.\n\nGrowing demand for fully electric vehicles, whose batteries use more of the metal than hybrids, is increasing the need for lithium. Additionally, the renewable energy sector will be seeking more lithium batteries to store solar- and wind-generated electricity.\n\nLithium isn't traded on an exchange like other commodities such as oil, copper or corn, but investors can get exposure to the metal through an exchange-traded fund or directly with companies that produce it or use it to make batteries.\n\nBatteries. When people buy an electric vehicle from Tesla Motors (ticker: TSLA), they're \"really buying a battery that has a car on it,\" says Hardeep Walia, co-founder and CEO of online brokerage Motif Investing and owner of a Tesla vehicle. Tesla is building a lithium-ion battery factory in Nevada that will produce electric car batteries as well as stationary energy storage devices.\n\nWith the rise of electric vehicles, Motif put together a basket of battery-related stocks that includes Tesla and lithium producers Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM), Albemarle Corp. (ALB) and FMC Corp. (FMC).\n\nIn addition to demand from electric vehicles and the renewable energy sector, the investment case for lithium also includes the proliferation of mobile phones and tablets, which also need lithium batteries, Walia says.\n\nDemand for lithium for battery applications is growing by about 10 percent per year, says Dmitry Silversteyn, basic materials analyst for Longbow Research, an equity research firm in Independence, Ohio. Total growth, which includes uses in lubricants and medical applications, is around 3 to 5 percent annually, he says.\n\nThat probably won't increase until electric car demand accelerates, which may come in 2017-2018, Silversteyn says.\n\nSupply. Companies producing lithium have enough of the metal to supply the world's needs for five to seven years, and more capacity can be brought online relatively quickly, Silversteyn says. But rapid growth in demand could make for some short-term tightness in the market.\n\nChile and Australia are the world's biggest lithium-producing nations, followed by China and Argentina. Bolivia also has substantial lithium deposits, but they are controlled by the government.\n\nPennsylvania-based FMC forecasts $33 million to $43 million in lithium segment earnings this year. Last year, FMC's lithium segment earned $23 million off of $238 million in revenue, out of a company total of $3.3 billion in revenue.\n\nIn the 12 months through Sept. 30, revenues from lithium and derivatives for Chile-based SQM totaled $212 million, or 12 percent of total revenues.\n\nAnd in the first nine months of 2015, Louisiana-headquartered Albemarle, which produces lithium from operations in Chile and Nevada and holds a 49 percent stake in a company mining in Australia, sold nearly $370 million worth of lithium out of total sales of $2.7 billion.\n\nOther, more speculative, plays on the production side include Western Lithium, which is developing lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, and Pure Energy Minerals, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada and in September signed an agreement with Tesla for potential lithium supply.\n\nPoor performance. Over the past year, lithium-related stocks have not done well. The Global X Lithium ETF (LIT), which targets the most liquid lithium battery producers, miners and refiners by tracking the Solactive Global Lithium Index, was down 21 percent. SQM, Albemarle and FMC were off 34 percent, 3 percent and 40 percent, respectively.\n\nBecause each of these companies is diversified beyond lithium, their recent declines are probably due to other issues with other parts of their business, Silversteyn says, noting he believes the investment case for lithium is still intact because of potential future demand from electric vehicles.\n\nDeclines are more likely due to concerns in the electronics industry, the broader consumer market and China, Silversteyn says.\n\nMotif Investing's basket of battery equities, which includes 12 stocks, is weighted toward battery makers but also includes the producers, industrial solutions companies and a consumer application stock. The basket, which the company calls a motif, is down more that 20 percent in the last 12 months, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index is off about 8 percent.\n\nOne reason for lithium's weak performance is its relation to renewable energy, which tends to move inversely to oil stocks, Walia says. With oil prices sliding, alternative energy has looked less appealing as a competitor.\n\nHeadwinds also include slowing Chinese growth, a mobile device market that has reached saturation in some areas and macroeconomic and interest-rate uncertainty, he says.\n\nWhile there is no simple answer as to whether now is a good time for bargain-hunting in lithium, Walia says taking a position makes sense for investors who think oil will move higher, a Chinese recovery will increase demand for mobile devices and electric vehicles will take off to also be bullish on lithium.\n\n\"This is not a bad way to play a recovery,\" he says. \"But you have to have conviction on a lot of things.\"", "The referral program will now include the chance to win the P90 Model X and a tour of SpaceX.\n\nTesla Motors has launched its successful referral program for the third time.

Here's a look at what traders are expecting to see from Tesla in the coming year.\n\nWhen Tesla announced its fourth-quarter results, the company emphasized the potential for growth in 2016. The firm is expecting deliveries for ramp up to between 80,000 and 90,000 this year, a sizable jump from the 50,600 seen in 2015. However, many are skeptical about that guidance, especially since the carmaker has consistently missed delivery estimates for the past two years.\n\nOne of Tesla's major draws is the strong demand it has drummed up for its vehicles. The company's Model X orders rose 75 percent last year. This figure is made all the more impressive by the fact that the car isn't displayed at all in any of Tesla's stores and the firm doesn't invest any money into advertising the car. Not only that, but the Model X is considered a luxury SUV, one of the fastest growing categories in the auto sector.\n\nAnother catalyst for Tesla this year is the firm's Model 3 vehicle. The car will be sold at a much lower price point, $35,000, and could attract a new pool of customers. So far, interest in the car has been high and CEO Elon Musk said he is expecting to see a healthy number of orders placed when reservations for the car are taken in March.\n\nTesla's energy storage business is another factor that could be appealing to investors. The company set up Tesla Energy about a year ago, and demand for Tesla's energy products appears to be in strong. Tesla completed work on a Gigafactory in Nevada where its energy products will be made, and many believe this shift will be positive for the firm's bottom line as renewable energy gains attention across the country.", "Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) has finally acquired the Tesla.com domain name. It is now forwarding Tesla.com to TeslaMotors.com.\n\nThe domain name was registered in 1992, well before the company was formed.

The domain name was registered to Stu Grossman of SG Consulting in California. (I will call him at a reasonable hour California time to inquire.)\n\nIt has long been a question on many Tesla enthusiasts' minds: when would the company acquire the Tesla.com domain name? It became more important when Tesla announced it was expanding beyond autos and into home batteries with its Tesla Powerwall.

Since the dot-com boom two decades ago, a new breed of CFO has emerged. These finance chiefs don't mind jumping from startup to startup, preferring the excitement of fresh beginnings to the everyday routine of a brand-name corporation.\n\nIndeed, the career risk is part of the attraction for finance chiefs at early-stage firms in the information technology sector. While such companies may fail fast, they can also have big upsides.\n\nMore than that, however, the appeal for many CFOs in working for tech startups is the opportunity to create a finance function from scratch, get involved in operations, and play a key part in a fast-growing environment. To be sure, such finance chiefs retain all the traditional finance functions, including accounting, tax, financing, and risk management. But the top finance job also typically demands the flexibility to work on other corporate functions.\n\nWhile maintaining adequate cash flow is, not surprisingly, high on their list of concerns, helping their companies attract top talent seems an even more critical focus for startup finance chiefs.\n\nSuch are the takeaways from recent conversations with four CFOs of software startup businesses about their current jobs and career paths. They represent a rich variety of endeavors: social-media data mining, radiology, accounts payable and payments automation, and -- yes -- providing grocery shoppers with detailed information about every egg they buy. Here are their stories.\n\nWhy He Left Google\n\nJulio Pekarovic, Dataminr\n\nAlthough it wasn't exactly like working for a traditional startup, Julio Pekarovic feels he got his first exposure to life in the fast lane in 1995, when he became commercial planning director of Expo '98, the 1998 World's Fair in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn that capacity, he built a team responsible for the revenue-generating operations of the 132-day exposition that grew from a handful of staffers to a roster of 1,000. His staff's work included rounding up official sponsors, selling tickets, and merchandising.\n\n\"That was the first taste I got of hypergrowth and growing companies. In this case it was a World's Fair, but it was on a fast-paced basis,\" recalls Pekarovic, now the CFO of Dataminr, a seven-year-old firm that mines tweets for data that companies can use to control their risks.\n\nJust as the dot-com boom was peaking, Pekarovic moved to Silicon Valley to eventually become senior finance manager for financial planning and analysis at Commerce One, where he ran the startup's global trading site. After it went public in 1999, the business-to-business e-commerce firm saw its share price jump nearly 1,900%, leading Wired magazine to crown it the top-performing initial public offering of the year.\n\nBut by 2002, like many of its peers, Commerce One was going downhill just as fast as it had risen. \"Unfortunately -- or fortunately -- the company was hit very hard by the dot-com bust,\" says Pekarovic. \"I lived through a series of layoffs until I decided to jump ship and move on to a little-known search-engine startup that became Google.\"\n\nAs Google's head of financial planning and analysis, Pekarovic was one of only a few hundred Google employees at the time. At the start of his seven years at the firm, he began hiring a finance team to support the growing business at Google. His first hire was Jason Wheeler, who is now CFO of Tesla Motors, the electric-car company.\n\nIn those days, Pekarovic recalls, sales numbers were being calculated and recorded by finance people within sales, rather than overseen by finance. To help achieve what he feels was needed separation between sales and finance, he became director of a new division at Google, which he himself dubbed sales finance, he remembers.\n\nBy 2009, Pekarovic had seen Google grow from a company with about $50 million in revenue to a $21 billion tech colossus with some 25,000 workers. But while the company was growing, the opportunity for creativity that he prized was shrinking. \"The greatest value that the majority of employees at that time could provide was just to follow the established rules,\" he says.\n\nAs a result, he decided to leave Google that year to become CFO of Quantcast, a digital ad audience-measurement firm founded just three years earlier. Then, after four years at Quantcast, Pekarovic took the finance helm at Dataminr in September 2015.\n\nBy a number of measures, Dataminr, which was founded in 2009, wouldn't exactly be considered a startup. After all, it's been valued at $700 million, lists Fidelity Investments among its major shareholders, and employs about 200 people. To Pekarovic, though, the essence of being a startup may be more a state of mind than anything else. \"I think Google in many ways considers itself a startup and always did,\" he says. \"It's an innovation hotbed.\"\n\nAnd Dataminr? \"The way that I would classify us is that we're a technology company with a huge opportunity in front of us,\" says Pekarovic.\n\nDriven by Uncertainty\n\nAndrew Webb, Candescent Health\n\nTwo decades of working for small, midsize, and large companies have given Andrew Webb a clear sense of the kind of organization that fits his temperament.\n\n\"I figured out over time that smaller companies are where I am most invigorated,\" says Webb, CFO and chief administrative officer of Candescent Health. \"Part of it is that there is almost immediate feedback on the things that you do.\" Moreover, he says, \"you can have the most influence on the success and, potentially, the failure of certain things. And that to me is really important.\"\n\nWebb's involvement with small firms began in earnest in 1999, when, as an associate in business development at Merrill Lynch, he helped launch a number of them. He left Merrill in 2002 to join one of those firms, a provider of capital markets data still known as Ipreo, as vice president of strategic development. Following Ipreo he spent five years as a managing director at financial services provider Knight Capital Group (now part of KCG Holdings), where he again helped launch a number of small firms.\n\nContinuing his career pattern of moving from jobs where he provided liquidity for early-stage firms to ones in strategy, operations, and, now, finance, Webb became CFO of Radisphere, a radiology practice, in 2014. The company was acquired by Sheridan Healthcare in 2015, but Radisphere founder Scott Seidelmann retained the firm's software, analytics, and business processes, subsequently starting Candescent Health as an independent software company. Webb took the finance helm at Candescent.\n\nUnlike Radisphere, which actually provides X-ray services, Candescent provides a cloud-based system that connects medical imaging practices with patients. Webb says that the change in his employer from health care provider to software startup has pushed him to be more innovative and find ways to make the firm more efficient.\n\nBefore the sale of Radisphere, the combined company was much bigger in terms of revenue and staff. \"Not to take away at all from the team that we had at Radisphere, but that got people into a mindset ... of doing things just because they had been done in the past,\" says Webb, who went from overseeing 10 finance staffers to just 2 at Candescent.\n\nThat shrinkage prompted the new company to simplify its processes. Thus, even with a smaller finance staff, Candescent was able to slash the time needed to close its books from seven to eight business days to three to four days.\n\nWebb attributes the efficiency to two changes generated by the launch of the new company and the separation from the old one. For one thing, shedding Radisphere meant that Candescent's finance team no longer had the burden of having to process the billing necessitated by thousands of radiology studies a month.\n\nThe second change involved the winnowing down of the company's personnel to a smaller team more attuned to the life of a startup. \"People who choose to work at a startup generally have a certain personality type,\" says Webb. \"And we actively go out and try and find those people.\"\n\nWhat kind of personality type is that? \"For a startup you want to find people who are really motivated to be in an environment in which there's always an element of uncertainty,\" explains Webb.\n\nThat uncertainty may range from where the next round of financing may be coming from to the nature of the work itself. Webb wants to hire people who are flexible enough to adjust when he says, \"I know we told you your job was this, but today it's going to be this, too.\"\n\nSmaller Is Better\n\nBill Price, Mineral Tree\n\nIn 1991, after eight years in public accounting at now-defunct Arthur Andersen, Bill Price had an opportunity to join one of his clients, MediQual.\n\nBain Capital had just invested in the medical software firm, which had a newly installed chief executive and was looking for a CFO. The leadership of the then-$2 million company \"reached out to me, and the timing was right,\" recalls Price.\n\nThus began his current 24-year run as a finance chief of nascent software firms. Following MediQual, where he led and managed the company's IPO and helped sell it to Cardinal Health in 1997 for $35 million, Price moved on to stints at NextPoint Networks, MarketSoft, and Zoominfo. Since 2013, he's headed up finance at MineralTree, a venture capital-backed software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm that sells accounts-payable software.\n\nComparing the desirability of working at larger, well-established companies and emerging firms, Price says: \"I've worked for both. I much prefer smaller.\"\n\nBut there are pros and cons to both. \"At an early-stage company there are certainly fewer resources to get your jobs done -- not as many systems, certainly not as many people,\" he says. \"But on the positive side, everyone at our company is doing original work. There's no such thing as a pure manager at Mineral Tree.\"\n\nThat gives him the chance to get involved in activities outside the realm of \"straight-up finance.\" In January 2015, for instance, MineralTree entered into an agreement in which e-commerce giant First Data is investing in the smaller firm and helping to finance the sale of MineralTree software to First Data customers.\n\nIn the wake of the deal, Price is currently working with First Data to make sure that MineralTree has \"policies, programs, practices, and operational steps in place to ensure that [First Data] customers' data is secure\" and that the software firm is complying with regulations.\n\nAmong the traditional bread-and-butter tasks of a finance chief, Price is most concerned with weighing the need for speed in raising cash against that of investing it wisely. \"It's always a challenge financing a growing company,\" he says, along with that of \"balancing the responsibility of managing cash and maneuvering around the ever-changing financial landscape as well.\"\n\nNow is a good time to raise cash, he observed late last year. Venture capitalists are doing more deals, he says, adding that \"private equity is definitely getting involved in the right-sized company. And strategic investors have a ton of cash and are looking to put it to use.\"\n\nLike other software companies, MineralTree's most important accounting metric is annual recurring revenues. \"With a SaaS-based company, it's really all about signing up customers to a subscription, whether it is monthly or annual or multiyear,\" says Price. \"If you can do that, you'll have a very successful software company, with significant growing revenues.\"\n\nGuaranteed Fresh\n\nDaren Schultz, TEN Ag Tech\n\n\"I like transparency, and I don't like that things are being hidden from people,\" says Daren Schultz, CFO of TEN Ag Tech, explaining what most appeals to him about the agricultural technology startup's business model.\n\nSchultz, who has been finance chief and treasurer of the private equity-owned firm since July 2015, was referring to the difficulty shoppers might have in determining the freshness of each egg in the cartons they buy in supermarkets. In environmentally conscious Southern California, that's a big concern, he says.\n\nIndeed, the San Juan Capistrano, California-based company aims, via its cloud-based technology, to partner with food retailers and farmers to get them to offer eggs that each have a use-by date and a code unique to the farm where the egg was laid. \"We can trace your egg's moment of packing to within 180 seconds,\" the firm's consumer website boasts.\n\n\"Everyone deserves accountability, and everyone's going to be able to understand whether there's freshness, transparency, certification,\" says Schultz. \"They'll be able to understand where the animals are, how they're being treated, and, ultimately, the safety of the food they're consuming.\"\n\nThe finance chief notes that it's still early days at TEN Ag Tech -- and that's precisely one of the things he likes about it. He defines the five-year-old firm as a startup because it's in a \"test mode,\" having spent the bulk of its efforts on research and development and patent work before 2015. It was only last year that the firm did a \"soft launch\" of its application, he says.\n\n\"We're still very young, and we're not quite out to market yet in full capacity,\" notes Schultz, who joined the firm in 2014 as director of financial operations before being promoted to his current post.\n\nPreviously, he was director of finance at Mitchell International, a provider of insurance claims handling technology owned by private equity giant KKR. Referring to Mitchell as a \"more established\" company, Schultz feels he has more leeway to make a mark at TEN Ag Tech. \"In established companies the business model and a lot of the processes are in place already,\" he says, \"whereas here, I'm going to be able to add a lot more value.\"\n\nOne area in which he feels he's making a difference is in closing the firm's books. \"When I joined the company the close process wasn't very thorough,\" Schultz recalls. Now, \"we are taking steps every day to improve and speed up the close.\"", "What you're really paying for when you buy an electric car like the Tesla Model S isn't the savings on fuel, or even the whisper quiet ride. You're paying for the ability to be smug and self-righteous to drivers in petrol-powered cars, and now even little kids can start making others feel guilty about driving a petrol-guzzler.\n\nTesla Motors teamed up with Radio Flyer -- the company most famous for its red metal wagons -- to create a miniature version of the Model S that uses similar battery technology to achieve a top speed of 9km/h.

The callers were frustrated and concerned.\n\nAnd rightfully so, believes Lamore, the owner of a solar company that installs panels on roofs. Within days after the vote, he would help cancel about 75 pending contracts for panel installations. For those customers, who had already applied for solar with NV Energy, it no longer made financial sense to go through with the installation.\n\n\"I couldn't even give a number of that,\" Lamore said of how many calls he had received. \"It was such a flurry, and it was so fast.\"\n\nSolar Energy Support Rally Launch slideshow \"\n\nWhen the state's three-member Public Utilities Commission OK'd the bill increase, industry advocates declared the new rate structure a poison pill for the market. The commission tripled a fixed fee over 12 years and slashed the value of credits customers earn by generating excess electricity through net metering.\n\nThe commission's rationale for the new rate was that it would more accurately reflect the cost of having solar customers on the grid and prevent shifting that cost to other nonsolar ratepayers. The old rules, commissioners say, were created when solar was more expensive and when few solar customers were connected to the grid.\n\nBut the industry said the move put a pin through the ballooning solar industry, in which customers rely on low utility bills to offset their investment in solar panels.\n\nNow, more than one month after the new rates went into effect, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the future of the rooftop solar industry in Nevada. Whether attributable to customer confusion, the new rates or the departure of solar firms, recent data appears to make one trend evident: rooftop solar sales have dwindled to a trickle.\n\nAnd that trickle has sent ripples through the industry, affecting local installers and leaving customers confused about what's next.\n\nRooftop solar applications plummet\n\nIn December, 1,311 residents in Southern Nevada submitted applications with NV Energy to start the process of installing and connecting solar panels. According to NV Energy data, that number fell to 90 applications in January -- a decrease of 93 percent.\n\nLyndon Rive, CEO of SolarCity, the national solar company chaired by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk, said the decrease was a reaction to the new rate structure.\n\n\"It's becoming increasingly clear that the (commission's) rate hikes ended the rooftop solar industry in Nevada and took away citizens' right to produce their own power at home,\" Rive said in a statement. \"Now that the state has seen the impact of the (commission) ruling, we hope they will reconsider this decision.\"\n\nPart of the reason for the decrease in applications, others said, could be that at least six solar companies, including national giants SolarCity and Sunrun, have pulled their sales operations from the state when the new rates were implemented.\n\nA significant contraction of the market is not unprecedented after a regulatory decision, said Davide Savenije, a senior editor at the trade publication Utility Dive. He notes that when Arizona utility Salt River Project added a $50 demand charge, SolarCity reported a 96 percent decrease in applications.\n\n\"You can see that those numbers are actually pretty similar,\" he said.\n\nHe added that these metrics matter because many regulators, utilities and solar companies across the nation were watching the effects of the decision here.\n\n\"When a precedent is set in a decision like this, other people are paying attention,\" he said. \"I think you are going to see the ripple effects of this decision in other states and in other regions.\"\n\nLocal installers see a changing market\n\nBefore the commission issued its decision in December, Scott Shaw, an executive with local installer Go Solar, said the company had fielded more than 25 orders. After the decision, that number went down to two.\n\nThe company, founded in 2010, performed one installation in December and one in January. The customers who placed those orders felt the value proposition still existed for them because they had smaller rooftop solar systems, meaning they had relatively low up-front costs and weren't affected by the decrease in net metering credits because they weren't expecting to generate excess power.\n\nThe company laid off more than a dozen employees and is shifting its focus to other energy efficient technologies.\n\nFrank Rieger, CEO of Las Vegas-based Sol-Up USA, said before the regulatory process started several months ago, his company had been averaging about one order per day. In the last three months, he said it had sold two systems. Since the decision: zero sales.\n\nBut he reasons that \"even the worst regulation\" is better than uncertainty. \"The clients have a business model that they can at least work with,\" Rieger said.\n\nHowever, Rieger said he expected the ruling to be challenged and overturned in court.\n\n\"Quite honestly, I think the current regulation is not going to stand up, anyway,\" he said.\n\nWhile most companies believe the commission decision severely weakened the value proposition for going solar, some believe that there still might be some room for the industry. Savenije said that while companies have retreated because of the rates, \"that doesn't mean that solar is never going to be economical in Nevada.\" Solar might remain advantageous for some state residents based on their individual circumstances, he said, and the ruling also might force solar companies to change their financing and offers.\n\nCustomers are in limbo\n\nFrom the perspective of installation companies, Henderson should be a prime location for rooftop solar. It has a high density of homes, and sunlight hits it nearly 365 days out of the year.\n\nBut installations there fell sharply in January. According to building permits, the city approved 11 installations, compared to more than 200 in December. It was not immediately clear that data listed on the websites of other municipalities reflect final building permits, which indicate the approval of installations.\n\nAs of Feb. 11, NV Energy reported 19,310 net metering customers statewide. But the number of people affected by the decision is larger. NV Energy also had an additional 12,433 customers with pending applications.\n\nMany customers have tried to ditch rooftop solar but are stuck for a variety of different reasons. Customers typically sign contracts to lease panels or purchase solar energy with companies like SolarCity and Sunrun before their panels are ever installed. After the commission decision, the companies allowed some of these customers to pull out of contracts if their panels had not been installed. Sunrun said close to 1,000 pre-install customers canceled contracts.\n\nBut once the panels were installed, consumers were locked into the contracts, which generally last 20 years. Some faced other long-term financial obligations, like bank loans for those who opted to purchase solar systems as opposed to leasing them.\n\nHenderson resident Manny Sayegh, who has been using solar power for about six months, said the new rates altered the equation for paying off his system. Most solar customers get a lease because they believe lower utility bills will allow them to break even or profit on their payments to solar companies.\n\n\"We're stuck either way,\" he said of the contract.\n\nAmid the turmoil over rates, Nevadans have filed lawsuits against NV Energy and SolarCity, and solar companies have vowed to restore the pre-ruling rate structure. A group backed by SolarCity is pushing a ballot measure that would effectively bring back the rates, and is urging legislators to call a special session. In the coming weeks, the Alliance for Solar Choice also plans to challenge the commission decision in court. Other affected parties are exploring similar action. Because the bill increases will be gradually implemented over 12 years, the next increase will not occur until 2019, giving the Legislature an opportunity to take up the matter during its next session.\n\n\"Most of the impact of the rate hikes will be felt after this year, which gives us time to fight on behalf of our customers,\" Chandler Sherman, a spokesperson for SolarCity, said Tuesday in a statement. \"The majority of Nevadans disagree with the PUC's decision and we are confident that if the Legislature doesn't do the right thing, the people will have a chance to overrule them.\"", "President Obama's proposed $10.25-per-barrel tax on oil has been met with almost universal derision from the commentariat, especially on the right side of the political aisle.\n\nWhile I agree with only a few of Obama's initiatives, I think this one in particular makes a lot of sense. (Though I believe the money should be applied to debt reduction, not additional spending.)\n\nThe U.S. budget is a great, hidden issue in this election. And if it was given even a tenth of the time wasted on the hopeless Middle East, we might get somewhere.\n\nNow, there are two potential problems with new taxes:\n\nObama's proposed oil tax suffers from neither of these. It will increase the price of a gallon of gas by about $0.25 cents, restoring the federal tax to just above its 1993 level in real terms. This increase will be included in the consumer price index and other price indices, so low-income families will get a commensurate increase in social security, disability, and other benefits.\n\nOf course, there are usually individual hardship cases, and I expect Obama's oil tax to cause more hardship to heating oil users (who are generally poorer than those who use other heating fuels and live in colder places) than to drivers. But even for heating oil users, the tax increase would raise oil costs to around half of their level just two years ago.\n\nAs for the tax's effect on growth, it would be modest, merely lessening the consumer boost from lower oil prices. It wouldn't affect the supply side at all, aside from lessening consumers' increasing driving mileage due to the current low oil prices.\n\nOf all the ways of raising substantial tax money, economically, this is the most benign.\n\nThe oil tax would provide $319 billion over 10 years to address the budget deficit. Unfortunately, based on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections, that would still leave $9.1 trillion in deficits unaddressed over 2017-26.\n\nThat's a staggering number - about 50% of current gross domestic product (GDP). And it's not lessening. We've added over $100 billion to this year's deficit compared to last year's, and the CBO expects trillion-dollar deficits to reappear by 2022.\n\nWhat's more, the CBO projections don't allow for another recession between now and 2026.\n\nAs I write, the Standard and Poor's 500 Index is down 11% since January 1. You can't tell me the market isn't anticipating another recession!\n\nAnd I believe the market is almost certainly correct in this belief. Based on what happened in 2008-09, with foolish bailouts and massive spending \"stimulus\" just for the hell of it, U.S. budget deficits in the coming recession will exceed $2 trillion per annum, or 11% of GDP. At some point, these huge deficits will become impossible to finance, and we may reach that point well before 2026.\n\nSo the $30 billion a year from Obama's gas tax is at least a down payment on deficit reduction, which Congress could pass this year if it wanted to. After that, it will come down to choosing one, or both, of two options to close the rest of the deficit: huge tax increases, which would be very damaging to economic growth, or spending cuts, which might very well improve it.\n\nFor example, we shouldn't waste the $319 billion raised by the gas tax on infrastructure, which is expensive by historical standards at 10 times its real cost 50 years ago due to environmental hassles, lawyers, excessive regulation, and unionization.\n\nInstead, the gas tax should essentially be a carbon tax, a contribution to fighting global warming, so we can remove an equivalent amount of clean energy subsidies and remain \"warming neutral.\"\n\nFor example, removing the subsidy for electric automobiles could save $7.5 billion by 2020. (It would send Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) down the tubes, but my guess is that will happen anyway in the next recession, judging by the company's latest $889 million annual loss.)\n\nWe probably can't quite match the $30 billion a year yield from the tax, but if we achieve even half of it, chopping $15 billion a year from clean energy subsidies, the budget deficit will be reduced by $45 billion annually, which isn't chopped liver.\n\nOn one issue, President Obama is right and the Republicans are wrong: We need to raise taxes. And, even more urgently, we need to reduce government spending. Unfortunately, five years of a Republican Congress and a year of a Republican Senate have proven unable to do that.\n\nAt this point, even a successful burst of spending reduction merely means we need to increase taxes less than we would otherwise. The President's oil tax is one of the least-damaging tax increases you can find, and we would be wise to institute it.", "Associated Press Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Inc., introduces the Model X car at the company's headquarters on Sept. 29, 2015.

Antonio Guerrera, D-Rocky Hill, and Sen. Andrew M. Maynard, D-Stonington, deputy majority leader.\n\nThe move came a week after Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, majority leader, announced with Tesla representatives that he was reintroducing legislation letting Tesla and other electric vehicle makers sell cars directly to consumers.\n\n\"By raising this bill, they are sending a clear message that Connecticut is ready to embrace innovation, economic growth and consumer choice,\" Jim Chen, Tesla's vice president of regulatory affairs and deputy general counsel, said in a statement.\n\nState law prevents manufacturers from selling directly to consumers, requiring them to conduct sales instead through independently-owned dealers. Tesla, however, does not operate dealerships to sell its electric vehicles.\n\nTesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers to make the best impression of its cars to buyers, given their extremely low sales volume compared to large automobile firms, spokesman Will Nicholas said. Further, an independent dealer would have to sell gasoline-powered cars alongside the Tesla cars to stay in business, and that would hurt Tesla sales, he said.\n\nTesla sold 50,580 vehicles in 2015, while General Motors sold 9.8 million for the year.\n\nDuff's bill mirrors legislation introduced last year by the Transportation Committee that was passed by the House of Representatives but died in the Senate. The measure would allow electric car companies without a physical presence in the state open up to three dealerships. Its purpose is to \"increase revenue gain to the state by expanding the car dealer license eligibility to additional manufacturers,\" the bill stated.\n\n\"This bill helps to continue our commitment to clean energy and will also positively impact sales tax revenue and job growth,\" Duff said.\n\nGeneral Motors has expressed concern over the proposal, saying it believes all industry participants should operate under the same rules and requirements. The company has said Tesla could open a franchised dealership with an independent operator in Connecticut now, but instead insists being given \"unique rules and special exceptions to suit their own business interests.\"\n\nAllowing car companies to sell cars directly to consumers would not affect used-car dealers because their sales are not connected to a franchise, said Peter Saldamarco, president of the Connecticut Automobile Dealers Association. He said the concept does raise several concerns, however, such as how the buyer will be protected or serviced.\n\n\"It's counter to the history of how automobile sales has been,\" he said. \"It's always been a dealer network.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nContact Michael C.

The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nQuickTake Batteries\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate -- an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries -- have surged 47 percent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence Ltd. Two of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months among a Bloomberg Index of 2,035 listed companies are developers of lithium materials operations. From 2015 to 2024, the market to supply lithium ion batteries for light vehicles may total $221 billion, according to Navigant Consulting Inc.\n\n'Step Change'\n\n\"There's a step change going on right now,\" as electric car sales rise and hybrid vehicles switch to lithium ion batteries, said Michael Fotios, executive chairman of General Mining Corp., which is seeking to begin exports by July of the lithium-bearing mineral spodumene from Western Australia's Mt. Cattlin project. \"Raw material supply hasn't kept pace, and probably can't keep pace with the projected demand.\"\n\nPerth-based General Mining, with a market value of A$86 million ($62 million), has seen its shares rise more than 1,000 percent in Sydney trading since it announced a plan in Feb. 2015 to resume production at the previously shuttered Mt. Cattlin. Pilbara Minerals Ltd., with a market value of A$286 million, is accelerating development of its Pilgangoora project in Western Australia and forecasts production from about 2018. The company has advanced about 1,200 percent since it acquired the site in July 2014.\n\nGreenbushes, the world's largest spodumene mine, is also located in Western Australia and owned by the Talison joint venture between China's Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group Co. and Albemarle Corp., the world's biggest lithium producer.\n\nLithium carbonate's price gains will extend to 2017 on weak supply, while demand is likely to soar 64 percent by 2020 from 2015 levels, Citigroup Inc. forecasts. This rising demand is intensifying a race to deliver new sources of lithium raw materials, spurring gains for developers poised to enter production before the end of the decade.\n\nChina is targeting the goal of five million electric vehicles on its roads by 2020, under President Xi Jinping's strategic initiative to upgrade the nation's auto industry. Nissan and Renault SA said this month that sales of battery-powered vehicles rose to a record last year, while Volkswagen AG's Audi plans to start building its first purely electric sport utility vehicle in 2018.\n\n\"The demand in vehicles, electric bikes, trucks and buses is going to be enormous, and the electric storage market is also going to be significant,\" said Neil Biddle, executive director of Perth-based Pilbara Minerals, which holds the world's second-biggest deposit of spodumene. Prices of spodumene have jumped to about $480 a metric ton this year from around $380 a ton in 2014, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nLithium products used in batteries come from three sources: hard rock mining of mineral ores including spodumene; battery recycling; and the evaporation of brine from salt ponds, the technique that has historically dominated production. While hard rock miners such as General Mining and Pilbara Minerals are higher cost than brine projects, they have lower capital spending needs and are quicker to production, making them the best placed to exploit surging prices, according to Foster Stockbroking Pty.\n\nThe cheapest source of lithium is brine and the biggest reserves are in Chile, where companies such as Albemarle and Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA harness the sun and the world's driest desert to evaporate brine from ponds. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, plans to develop lithium holdings in Chile's northern desert salt flats. Rio Tinto Group, the world's second biggest miner, has a lithium-borate project in Serbia.\n\nPrevious Booms\n\nJust as in previous booms, when miners responded to increasing demand for materials by providing too much supply, a potential risk in lithium is that potential growth for new energy vehicles in China is being overestimated, Elsa Wang, senior analyst at consultancy Asian Metal Inc. in Beijing, said by phone. If all current lithium projects proceed as planned, they would deliver about 330,000 tons of lithium carbonate-equivalent by 2020, creating \"a bit of an oversupplied market,\" according to Citigroup analyst Matthew Schembri.\n\nTesla, the producer of electric vehicles and power storage products led by billionaire Elon Musk, is preparing to open its giant Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada. It will probably require 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide a year when it reaches capacity, according to Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral, an industry advisory company. That's equivalent to about 45 percent of current global supply, he said.\n\nLG Chem Ltd. last year completed construction of an electric-vehicle battery plant in Nanjing, China, with capacity to supply batteries for 50,000 high-performance electric cars annually. Boston-Power Inc. is expanding its plants in China, and Panasonic Corp., which makes batteries for Tesla cars, has added a joint venture there.\n\nNew supply from all lithium sources \"will have a critical role to play in sourcing lithium for the battery supply chain,\" Moores said. \"As things stands, there will not be enough lithium to supply the battery megafactories coming onstream.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "The next Elon Musk may soon be working at a City University of New York campus in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, perhaps joined by the next Sergey Brin in Flushing, Queens.

The plan, called IN2NYC, is to have 80 entrepreneurs set up shop on CUNY campuses, advising professors and students while working to build companies -- in exchange for a special temporary work visa that is exempt from the quotas. New York is the first city in the country to offer such a program.\n\nThe entrepreneurs will qualify for a skilled-worker visa, known as an H-1B. Applicants need an employer to sponsor them for the visas, which are extremely limited: The visas are capped at 65,000 a year, with another 20,000 available for foreign students who have earned graduate degrees in the United States. Last year, 233,000 people entered the lottery for the visas, with about two-thirds of them losing out.\n\nBut people working with nonprofits and institutions of higher education are exempt from the caps, and IN2NYC will use its partnerships with CUNY to help the entrepreneurs get the visas.\n\nKevin Ryan, an entrepreneur who founded Gilt Groupe, an online shopping company, and MongoDB, a database company, among half a dozen start-ups, hailed the program as a way to increase the number of visas available to foreign talent in the city. \"Normally the city says we can't do anything about it,\" Mr. Ryan said, referring to immigration reform. \"So with this, they found a loophole here, which is going to add potential entrepreneurs and engineers.\"\n\nMr. Ryan said many New York companies had to hire employees abroad, so being able to keep talent in the city was a priority. \"It's not as impactful as opening up the number of H-1B visas,\" he said, \"but it's a great step forward.\"\n\nMaria Torres-Springer, the president of the development corporation, said the program would build on New York's history of being a welcoming place to immigrants. \"We're seeing innovation hubs really beginning to blossom all over the city,\" she said, mentioning a clean-technology incubator she recently visited in Brooklyn, made up mostly of immigrant workers.\n\n\"The program builds on the momentum, in a way where international entrepreneurs who want to relocate in the city now have a pathway to do that, as opposed to navigating what is currently a complex system.\"\n\nIN2NYC will work with seven campuses: Baruch College, City College, the College of Staten Island, LaGuardia Community College, Lehman College, Medgar Evers College and Queens College.\n\nEntrepreneurs will form a board of directors, most of whom will be American citizens or permanent residents, to establish the employer-employee relationship that an H-1B visa requires. Since entrepreneurs will be employed at a college for more than half their time, collaborating with professors and students, they will be exempt from the H-1B visa caps.\n\n\"The impact of an immigration lawyer to help the next Elon Musk with no visa or a college student with no status has never been more significant,\" said Peter F. Asaad, the managing legal partner of Immigration Solutions Group, an immigration law firm in Washington that is providing counsel to New York City.\n\nMr. Musk, the founder of SpaceX and the co-founder of Tesla Motors, was born in South Africa and came to the United States as a college student. Mr. Brin, the co-founder of Google, was born in Russia.\n\nMr. Asaad has advised New York City on previous immigration programs involving entrepreneurs, and he thinks there will be a large pool of applicants who will already have \"substantial amounts of angel investors and other sources believing in their company.\"\n\nThe development corporation expects that each entrepreneur will initially employ at least three people. Applications will be accepted in late spring, with the program scheduled to start in autumn.\n\nMr. Ryan sees only an upside.\n\n\"Even if there are only a certain number who take advantage of this,\" he said, \"one of them will end up starting a really successful company, and that company will employ 500 people and create huge tax dollars. So this will pay off for New York City.\"", "The company's nascent energy segment appears to be getting off to a fast-growing start.\n\nShares of electric-car maker and battery company Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed about 9% higher on Wednesday.

Musk is the chairman for both companies -- and the CEO of Tesla Motors. Musk has said he spends about 5% of his time working on SolarCity.\n\nIndeed, the terms of the deal appear to be competitive: \"Under the terms of the 20-year contract announced in September 2015, KIUC will pay SolarCity 14.5 cents per kilowatt hour, only slightly more than the cost of energy from KIUC's two existing 12 megawatt solar arrays, whose output is available only during the day.\"\n\nThe magnitude of the deal is notable. The order is for 13 megawatts of electric storage from Tesla's Powerpack system -- a deal that is likely the biggest utility-scale storage project in North America to date.\n\nAlready receiving most of the required state and county approvals, it's looking like the deal will go through. But it could still face hurdles as the project is now waiting for final approval from the Hawai'i Public Utilities Commission. The press release noted that KUIC and SolarCity are together requesting an accelerated review of the project \"so that construction work can begin by April with a goal of being in commercial operation by the end of 2016.\"\n\nA model for the future\n\nThere are a couple of implications for Tesla investors.\n\nFirst, the scale of the potential deal suggests Tesla's energy storage business is ramping up quickly. Tesla's energy storage business, called Tesla Energy, was introduced less than a year ago.\n\nTesla said in its most recent shareholder letter that demand for its energy products was \"strong.\" To help meet demand, the company transitioned production of its energy products to its Gigafactory in Nevada earlier than expected.\n\nRendering of a complete version of Tesla's Gigafactory, which is currently under construction. Image source: Tesla Motors.\n\nThis deal is representative of Tesla's confidence in its production ramp-up or energy products.\n\nSecond, the project could serve as a model to solicit similar orders from utility companies in the future.\n\n\"The proposed SolarCity/Tesla project is believed to be the first utility-scale system in the U.S. to provide dispatchable solar energy,\" the release explained, \"meaning that the utility can count on electricity being available when it's needed, even hours after the sun goes down.\"\n\nAny news of big orders for Tesla Energy is good news for Tesla investors, as the company noted in its most recent shareholder letter that the segment is already achieving positive gross margins and is on track to be a positive cash contributor for the company even if growth occurs rapidly.", "Deep in the heart of Silicon Valley the city of Palo Alto has experienced a teen suicide cluster, which has caught the eye of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). A team of experts from the CDC is headed to Palo Alto to investigate the suicide cluster, which is actually the second cluster this city has seen in recent years.\n\nAccording to ABC News on February 17, the CDC defines a suicide cluster as \"three or more suicides in close proximity in regards to space and time.\" The suicides in the city of Palo Alto fits this description.\n\nBetween the years of 2009 and 2010 five students or recent graduates of the Henry M Gunn High School had committed suicide. This \"signaled a suicide cluster\" for the CDC.\n\nShawna Chen talked with ABC News about the day she told her friends she would be attending Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto as a freshman in high school. She was surprised to hear them say \"that's the high school with suicides.\"\n\nChen said she didn't realize the gravity of this at first until her first two years in high school were done and in her third year another cluster of suicide occurred. Between October 2014 and March 2015 four teens committed suicide on the railroad tracks in Palo Alto. Three of the teens went to the Henry M. Gunn High School and the fourth student went to nearby Palo Alto High School.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports, this is an area of California that has given birth to Facebook, Tesla Motors, Google and HP. In this town for the last seven years, teens are ending their lives with suicides by trains and other means. The adolescent suicide rate in this town has \"soared to five times the national average.\"\n\n\"Over the course of nine months in 2009 and 2010, six Palo Alto teenagers died by suicide. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 20 children and young adults died of suicide annually in Santa Clara County,\" reports the Herald.\n\nThese deaths came in two suicide clusters and while there are an average of five suicide clusters in the U.S. each year, it is extremely rare when two occur in the same city within the same decade, which is what is seen in Palo Alto.\n\nThe teens took their own lives by dying on the tracks, \"but also by hanging, jumping off a roof or overpass.\" The aftermaths of these horrendous deaths play out the same each time it happened. \"Their their classmates mourned them, and their distraught parents sought answers,\" reports the Herald.\n\nThe CDC is planning to investigate these suicide deaths with experts in many fields on their team. They are arriving this week and plan to stay in Palo Alto for two weeks conducting this probe."]}, "Airbus": {"2016-02-17": ["The Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District voted to tender out engineering services for the expansion of the regional airport.\n\nThe ACRD has been turned down in all of its grant applications, leaving them needing to borrow all $6 million. They received voter approval to borrow up to $6 million to extend the runway via an alternate approval process this summer.\n\nNot all directors were convinced; Ucluelet and Sproat Lake voted against.\n\n\"The question in my mind is do we go and try to find money with the new federal government and potentially talking to the province? Is it worth it to postpone the project?\" Cherry Creek director Lucas Banton asked prior to the vote.\n\nPort Alberni director Jack McLeman said it wasn't worth waiting.\n\n\"We've been turned down by three [grant bodies], we've had an alternate approval process we've gone through, we have investors wanting to stay or leave or come and not come to the airport. If we wait another year, we might as well say we don't want the airport.\"\n\nBeaver Creek director John McNabb said that at $14 of taxes per $200,000 home, the decision was easy.\n\n\"Last time I bought a case of beer, it was $39. I can live without a case of beer. We need to do everything we can to encourage grants to come forward.\"\n\nCity of Port Alberni economic development manager Pat Deakin said that Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training Shirley Bond had set her office to helping Port Alberni secure funding for the airport expansion, following a meeting the prior week.\n\n\"Their director of economic development for the transportation infrastructure program is really pushing to get us support for the project on a variety of fronts,\" Deakin said.\n\n\"They recognize with the memorandum of understanding that the Coulson Group signed with Airbus back in November [2015], there is huge opportunity and potential for the aerospace industry in the Valley to move forward.\"\n\nThe province announced $8 million in funding this year to support infrastructure improvements at B.C. airports this year as part of the 2016 B.C. Air Access Program.\n\nAccess to an enhanced airport could also bolster other economic development in the region, Deakin added.", "MONTREAL - Continued government support for global firms such as Bombardier Inc. is critical if Canada wants to diversify its economy beyond natural resources, say two business experts.\n\nBombardier (TSX:BBD.B) announced Wednesday it's cutting 7,000 jobs over two years, including roughly 3,000 in Canada, months after the Quebec government pledged US$1 billion of public money for the firm.\n\nThe federal Liberals say they are studying Bombardier's request for more funding, which reports say is also $1 billion.\n\nProf. Tyler Adam Chamberlin of the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management says more government cash for Bombardier is essential because the country doesn't have many firms like it.\n\nCanada's giant telecoms don't compete internationally and the country's big banks are insulated from foreign competition, he said.\n\n\"When you really dig into it and ask how many companies in Canada are really engaged in global, competitive industries, the number dwindles quickly,\" Chamberlin said.\n\nBombardier employs more than 70,000 people around the world and exports roughly 95 per cent of its products.\n\n\"There is no one at the size of a truly global competitor with a global footprint as Bombardier,\" said Karl Moore, professor at the Desautels faculty of management at McGill University.\n\nChamberlin said Bombardier's competitors such as Boeing in the United States and the European-based Airbus receive state support that \"dwarfs\" Canada's subsidies.\n\n\"This is the nature of the industry,\" Chamberlin said. \"We have to be prepared to ask ourselves that if we really want to be in this industry, this is what we have to do.\"\n\nChamberlin added that if Canada wants to get out of the boom-and-bust cycle of oil and to have an economy that relies less on extracting resources from the ground, supporting global industries such as Bombardier is essential.\n\nIn Quebec City, Premier Premier Philippe Couillard defended his government's decision to inject the money into Bombardier's CSeries commercial aircraft unit without taking an ownership percentage in the company's rail sector.\n\nCouillard said the move was the right one as 3,200 of the job cuts are set for the rail department with none planned on the CSeries side. Moreover, he pointed to Air Canada's announcement Wednesday it had signed a letter of intent for 45 CSeries planes, with an option to buy 30 more.\n\nThe CSeries is Bombardier's new generation of aircraft for commercial airlines and has been in development for more than a decade as an alternative to smaller models of passenger jets built by rivals Boeing and Airbus. The aircraft is about two years behind schedule and at least US$2 billion over budget.\n\nParti Quebecois Leader Pierre Karl Peladeau took Couillard to task, saying the government needs to renegotiate its deal with Bombardier.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" he said. \"The government is putting $1.3 billion (Canadian) in a company that is going to reduce its workforce here in Quebec.\"\n\nOne area of agreement between the political rivals was their respective calls on Ottawa to come through with financial help.\n\n\"It's clear the federal government has to support the CSeries,\" Couillard said. \"If we're talking about innovation in aeronautics it's in Quebec that it's happening and when we're talking about innovation of aeronautics it's the CSeries.\"\n\nPeladeau urged Couillard to call Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and tell him to get cracking on releasing funds for Bombardier.\n\n\"The aerospace business and the industry in Quebec is so important,\" Peladeau said. \"We need to make sure we take the proper measures to protect it.\"\n\nMoore said he believes Trudeau will come through for a few reasons.\n\n\"Given how many MPs are from Quebec, and the fact the prime minister and the transport minister both have their ridings in Montreal,\" he said. \"(Plus), Bombardier is Canada's top global firm.\"", "Rockwell gets GoAir contract Airline buys avionics for 72 Airbus airliners Video Photo GLU-925 multimode receiver (From Rockwellcollins.com)\n\nGeorge C.

But no one said it had to be obscene too. It's obscene because the investors who will benefit most from the government-sponsored bailout programs - some in place, some to come - are the Bombardier and Beaudoin family members who remain in control of the company in spite of their epic management sins.\n\nThis is called rewarding bad behaviour, the equivalent of handing a BMW to your reckless son after he drove the Buick into a wall.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bombardier's new passenger jet, the C Series, scored a rare victory when Air Canada dropped its long aversion to the plane and signed a letter of intent for 45 aircraft, with options for another 30. If the orders are confirmed - there is no guarantee they will be - the slow-selling, overbudget jet will score a much-needed credibility boost and spare Bombardier's Montreal-area assembly lines from echo chamber status.\n\nAir Canada is a stock exchange company and is obligated to adopt the best value-creating strategies for all its shareholders. Maybe the efficient C Series is now deemed the perfect machine for Air Canada's short- and medium-haul routes (a role now ably fulfilled by the airline's Brazilian-made Embraer jets), and maybe the discount to the list price, which was not disclosed, was irresistible. Still, you can bet that Air Canada was on the receiving end of the best persuasive powers of the federal and Quebec governments.\n\nEven as Air Canada revealed its intention to buy the jets, Quebec agreed to drop a lawsuit against Air Canada in exchange for the airline's agreement to conduct maintenance on the C Series planes in Quebec. Sheer coincidence, to be sure.\n\nAerospace and defence companies all over the world enjoy special treatment by their governments. In exchange for goodies such as subsidies, tax breaks, cheap financing and lavish orders, these companies create high-paying manufacturing and engineering jobs that are often the pride and joy of national research and development efforts.\n\nAnd so it is with Bombardier, but somewhere along the line, the largesse turned into an apparently bottomless-pit rescue effort for the C Series without the Bombardier and Beaudoin families being forced to forfeit, or even dilute, their commanding position in the company they created. The extended family controls Bombardier through their A shares, which come with 10 votes apiece. The subordinate B shares, the ones that trade on the stock exchange, come with a mere one vote.\n\nIn 2008, shortly after the C Series was officially launched, (against the advice of a former chief executive officer, Paul Tellier), Bombardier negotiated a $350-million loan from Stephen Harper's Conservative government to help cover the plane's R&D costs. The Quebec and British governments stumped up small fortunes too.\n\nSo far, so good, and not many taxpayers complained, because national champions need to be supported to ensure they remain national champions. But the C Series became a bridge too far for Bombardier. Under former CEO Pierre Beaudoin, the son of Laurent Beaudoin, who is the son-in-law of Bombardier founder Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the company's aerospace division lurched from one crisis to another.\n\nThe executives vastly underestimated the competitive response of Airbus and Boeing, which did not take kindly to the Canadian upstart eating into their market. They made the mistake of launching another ambitious program - the Learjet 85 business jet - at the same time as the C Series (the Learjet program was recently mothballed). They reportedly refused to offer attractive discounts on the C Series to fill up the order book.\n\nThe result was horrendous cash burn, a collapsed share price, few sales - there are only 243 confirmed C Series orders - a two-year delay on the aircraft's commercial launch date and a project that has gone more than $2-billion (U.S.) over budget. But never mind, because the feds and Quebec would come to the rescue.\n\nThe Quebec government pumped $1-billion into the C series project while the province's pension fund manger, the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, invested $1.5-billion into Bombardier Transportation in exchange for a 30-per-cent stake in the Berlin-based train division. On Wednesday, Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare, who replaced the hapless Pierre Beaudoin last year, reiterated his appeal for help from Ottawa. \"A partnership with the federal government into the [C Series] is very important to us,\" he said.\n\nThe feds will probably comply, even if they go to great pains to spin any bailout as a commercial proposition that is in the taxpayers' best interest. But no sacrifice is being demanded of the Bombardier-Beaudoin family. Pierre Beaudoin may not be CEO any longer but he got a sweet consolation prize - executive chairman. The family retains its voting control of the company and is loath to relinquish it, even though its blocking position makes a strategic partnership with another aerospace company somewhere between impossible and difficult. Who wants to get into bed with a family that has veto power over everything?\n\nBombardier is going through a bizarre metamorphosis. It's on its way to becoming, in effect, a ward of the state under the control of a private family. It's a clever trick that should never have been allowed to happen. If Bombardier wants another dollop of taxpayer loot, which it does, the family that oversaw the massive value destruction should be invited to step aside.", "MONTREAL - Continued government support for global firms such as Bombardier Inc. is critical if Canada wants to diversify its economy beyond natural resources, say two business experts.\n\nBombardier (TSX:BBD.B) announced Wednesday it's cutting 7,000 jobs over two years, including roughly 3,000 in Canada, months after the Quebec government pledged US$1 billion of public money for the firm.\n\nThe federal Liberals say they are studying Bombardier's request for more funding, which reports say is also $1 billion.\n\nProf. Tyler Adam Chamberlin of the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management says more government cash for Bombardier is essential because the country doesn't have many firms like it.\n\nCanada's giant telecoms don't compete internationally and the country's big banks are insulated from foreign competition, he said.\n\n\"When you really dig into it and ask how many companies in Canada are really engaged in global, competitive industries, the number dwindles quickly,\" Chamberlin said.\n\nBombardier employs more than 70,000 people around the world and exports roughly 95 per cent of its products.\n\n\"There is no one at the size of a truly global competitor with a global footprint as Bombardier,\" said Karl Moore, professor at the Desautels faculty of management at McGill University.\n\nChamberlin said Bombardier's competitors such as Boeing in the United States and the European-based Airbus receive state support that \"dwarfs\" Canada's subsidies.\n\n\"This is the nature of the industry,\" Chamberlin said. \"We have to be prepared to ask ourselves that if we really want to be in this industry, this is what we have to do.\"\n\nChamberlin added that if Canada wants to get out of the boom-and-bust cycle of oil and to have an economy that relies less on extracting resources from the ground, supporting global industries such as Bombardier is essential.\n\nIn Quebec City, Premier Premier Philippe Couillard defended his government's decision to inject the money into Bombardier's CSeries commercial aircraft unit without taking an ownership percentage in the company's rail sector.\n\nCouillard said the move was the right one as 3,200 of the job cuts are set for the rail department with none planned on the CSeries side.

Image source: Airbus.\n\nBoeing and Airbus thus have huge economies of scale that enable them to beat back would-be competitors either through innovation, discounting, or a combination of the two. In light of this competitive dynamic, Embraer isn't trying to break into the market for larger jets. Instead, it hopes to move more of the market toward the smaller jets it specializes in.\n\nEmbraer carves a different path\n\nThe troubled history of Bombardier's CSeries jet shows the danger of trying to compete directly with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, the two best-selling jet designs in the world. The CSeries jets seat up to 160 passengers, putting them in the same segment as the smallest 737 and A320 variants.\n\nBombardier had high hopes for its new jet, based on its superior fuel efficiency. But Airbus and Boeing quickly discounted their competing offerings to stop the CSeries from gaining a big foothold. They then each introduced updated versions of their best-selling jets with new engines, dramatically narrowing the fuel efficiency gap.\n\nThis has led to persistently slow sales of Bombardier's CSeries jet. Meanwhile, cost overruns nearly put the company out of business. Bombardier was forced to turn to the government for big cash infusions in order to stay solvent.\n\nCSeries cost overruns have nearly bankrupted Bombardier. Image source: Bombardier.\n\nBy contrast, Embraer has recognized that discretion is the better part of valor. Even when it decided to redesign its E-Jet family, Embraer made sure that the largest model (the E195-E2) remained smaller and lighter than anything offered by Airbus or Boeing.\n\nShifting the market\n\nLimiting its focus to smaller jets means that Embraer is counting itself out of the biggest, most lucrative segments of the commercial aircraft market. However, Embraer thinks it can instead get more airlines interested in smaller planes.\n\nEmbraer has pushed this line of thinking aggressively at the Singapore Airshow this week. The company noted that for every two new routes that Asian budget carriers launched in 2015, they canceled one. Embraer thinks the problem is that these airlines only have larger Boeing and Airbus jets and many routes don't have enough demand to support planes of this size.\n\nWhile Embraer's E-Jets have somewhat higher unit costs (cost per passenger) than the popular 737-800 and A320 jets, they have significantly lower trip costs (cost per flight). When there's enough demand to fill a Boeing or Airbus jet at reasonable fares, it's sensible to use the bigger plane. But when lots of seats would remain empty -- or be sold well below cost -- a smaller plane like Embraer's E190 or E195 could be more profitable.\n\nOperating smaller jets would also enable low cost carriers to offer daily point-to-point flights on routes that are currently only served a few times a week. Finally, Embraer believes that there are many Asian markets with no flights today that would be viable with smaller jets.\n\nHoping for a philosophical shift\n\nEmbraer has put less emphasis on Asia than Boeing and Airbus. For example, Boeing expects to get nearly 40% of its sales over the next two decades from Asia (excluding the Middle East). For Embraer, the comparable figure is only 25%.\n\nHowever, that's still a significant chunk of Embraer's total market opportunity. Moreover, there is potentially huge upside to that market estimate if Embraer can convince Asian airline executives to focus on matching capacity to demand rather than minimizing unit costs by any means.\n\nEmbraer is already having modest success in China. Tianjin Airlines operates dozens of E-Jets, with more on the way, and Embraer has also captured smaller orders from several other Chinese airlines. Meanwhile, start-up airline Air Costa has big ambitions to kick-start regional aviation in India. It has ordered 50 next-generation E-Jets and may soon look to buy more.\n\nEmbraer thus has a clear opportunity to participate in the strong growth of the aviation sector in developing markets. Most importantly, it should be able do so without provoking a deadly competitive response from Airbus and Boeing.", "Airbus' interest in Singapore goes beyond just selling planes, although that is a key part of its business, said the European plane maker's president and chief executive Fabrice Bregier.\n\nFrom research and development to pilot training and plane maintenance, Airbus has multiple partnerships and tie-ups with Singapore Airlines (SIA), local tertiary institutions and other industry players.\n\nThe latest was announced yesterday: a deal with SIA Engineering (SIAEC) to set up a joint venture firm to service the A-380, A-350 and A-330. SIAEC will own 65 per cent of the new company, with Airbus taking the remaining stake.\n\nThe facility will service customers from across the region.\n\nA pilot training school - partly owned by SIA and Airbus - will open at Seletar Aerosapce Park in the coming months.\n\nThe Airbus group, with about 600 staff based here, has a significant presence in Singapore, second only to China in the Asia-Pacific, Mr Bregier said.\n\n\"We have partnerships in Vietnam and Malaysia and we also have activities in Thailand but not at the same level and depth as what we are doing here,\" he said.\n\n\"Singapore - with its pro-business environment and other advantages - is unique,\" he added.\n\nAirbus' presence here is part of a larger commitment to the region - one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. About 40 per cent of the firm's total aircraft orders are from Asian carriers and lessors, Mr Bregier said.\n\nSIA, for example, has ordered 67 A-350s, including seven of the ultra-long-haul variant which will be delivered in 2018.\n\nThe airline is also waiting for five new A-380s, adding to its existing fleet of 19 of the superjumbos.\n\nMoving beyond aircraft sales is part of the natural progression of the business, and is in line with customer requirements. Mr Bregier said: \"Many of our customers want to focus on their core business which is fleet planning and making sure their customers are happy.\"\n\nThere are also low-cost carriers that do not have the engineering capabilities to support fleet maintenance and pilot training, among other business needs, he said.\n\nMr Bregier said: \"This business of course is not the same size as the business of delivering aircraft but it's a good complementary business which contributes to profitability and the growth of Airbus.\n\n\"But more importantly, we build bridges with the airlines because they don't just buy aircraft, they buy a service and a relationship. And I think it's good that we do this not from Toulouse (Airbus' headquarters in France) or Germany but as close as possible to our customers.\"", "SEATTLE: Some suppliers to Boeing and Airbus are putting the breaks on expansion plans, saying they fear that planned increases in production by the big plane makers may not be sustained in the face of slowing growth and low oil prices.\n\nConsider AccraFab Inc, a precision manufacturer in Spokane, Washington, that produces parts for Boeing's 787 and other aircraft.\n\nIt recently spent $500,000 for high-speed punching equipment that can stamp complex metal cutouts used in housings for cockpit display screens, said President Greg Konkol.\n\n\"We're dragging our feet on two more investments,\" worth about $1.3 million, Konkol said. \"We know we have to ramp up, but we're being conservative about investing too much and getting overextended.\"\n\nThe situation is similar at Tech Manufacturing, a maker of milled wing and airframe pieces that supplies Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Embraer, Lockheed Martin's\n\nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter and business jet makers.\n\n\"We're taking a wait-and-see attitude,\" said Frank Kimball, senior vice president of sales at the company, located in Wright City, Missouri.\n\nTech Manufacturing bought three new machines in the last five years, he said, but now is \"looking very carefully at investing.\" Executives have priced other new equipment they want, he said. \"But it depends on some of these bids coming in.\"\n\nThe comments, made in interviews during a supplier conference in Seattle last week, reflect growing caution among the thousands of companies that produce parts for plane makers.\n\nBoeing and Airbus continue to forecast strong growth, and say they are fully committed to ambitious plans to increase production sharply through the end of the decade.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg dismissed investor concerns about a cyclical downturn on Wednesday, noting large backlogs of orders are enough to keep factories running for many years without selling another plane.\n\n\"This is fundamentally different than anything you have seen in history,\" Muilenburg said at an investor conference. \"We're not seeing any cyclical behavior. This is a strong long-term growth market.\"\n\nPassenger traffic is rising more than 6 per cent annually, above its historic 5 per cent average, Muilenburg noted, adding that Boeing plans to deliver more than 900 jetliners a year by the end of the decade, up from 762 last year.\n\nBut increasingly, suppliers are voicing concern that the high rates of production won't last. They fear that a weakening global economy, particularly in China and other emerging markets, will undercut growth.\n\n\"It causes us to play things a little tighter to the chest,\" said Konkol. His company now wants new equipment to pay back costs in one to two years, down from two to five years.\n\nNot all suppliers are being so cagey. Some say the lackluster growth forecasts and fears about falling sales of new fuel-efficient planes due to low oil prices are just temporary.\n\n\"We all know oil's going to go up,\" said Rick Taylor, a vice president at ALTEK Manufacturing, a parts maker in Liberty Lake, Washington. \"And if oil goes up, you're right back into new aircraft demand,\" he added. \"This is just a snapshot in time.\"\n\nBut automation companies also report caution among some suppliers. \"They're trying to plan, but they don't want to get too far ahead,\" said Tim Shumate, a vice president at Ascent Aerospace, an automation and tooling supplier based in Santa Ana, California. \"Nobody would. You don't want to make an investment and have it sit idle.\"\n\nMark Irby, senior account manager at KUKA Systems' aerospace group, which supplies automation to Boeing, said his company is bidding for work on the 737, but it's diversified in autos and other sectors, protecting it against a downturn.\n\nBut many smaller parts makers are especially worried about production targets Airbus and Boeing have set for their A320 and 737 assembly lines, rising to 60 and 57 a month in 2019, respectively, said Brian Murphy, an aerospace-focused investment banker at Meridian Capital in Seattle.\n\n\"Very few I know are taking steps today to meet the 2018 or 2019 rates,\" Murphy said. \"They're saying let's get to 47 and then 52 and they we'll worry about 60.\"", "SINGAPORE -- European plane-maker Airbus said on Wednesday it had won a $1.85 billion deal for the purchase of six A350-900s by Philippine Airlines (PAL), flag-carrier of one of Asia's fastest growing economies.\n\nPAL also has the option to purchase an additional six of the aircraft, the two companies announced at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nSeparately, PAL also signed a $600-million order with Rolls-Royce for Trent XWB engines to power the six A350s, the airline said in another statement.\n\nPAL president Jaime Bautista said the planes will be used for PAL's non-stop, long-haul flights from the Philippines to the United States, Canada and Europe.\n\nThe Philippines' economic growth in the past six years under President Benigno Aquino, who steps down in June, averaged 6.2 percent, one of the strongest performances in Asia, boosting travel demand.\n\nThe Philippines also relies on a diaspora of around 10 million Filipinos, or 10 percent of the population, many of them residing in the cities targeted by PAL.\n\nThe airline plays a key transportation link for millions of Filipinos who work abroad, with a route network tracing the key destinations of the labor diaspora.\n\n\"We are happy to announce that today we will commit to acquire six A350-900 series which will allow us... to fly non-stop from Manila to New York, allow us to increase our presence in the US, in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and also to Vancouver and Toronto,\" Bautista told a news conference.\n\n\"This aircraft will allow us to improve our operations to Europe, (it) will be used to fly from Manila to London.\" He added that the aircraft \"will really support our mission of becoming a full service five-star airline in five years.\"\n\nDelivery of the aircraft will start in 2018.\n\n\"The A350s range capability has been an important factor in our decision, enabling us to offer non-stop service on all our premium long-haul routes,\" Bautista said.\n\nThe order is worth $1.85 billion at list prices, although airlines usually get discounts on their purchases. -- AFP", "MONTREAL -- Bombardier announced Wednesday it will eliminate 7,000 positions over two years -- more than a third in Canada -- in the latest effort by the country's largest aerospace company to turn itself around as it awaits word of federal aid.\n\nThe Montreal-based firm said the layoffs will include 2,830 jobs in Canada, including 2,400 in Quebec. Nearly half of all the cuts would be at Bombardier Transportation, its rail division, which will lose 3,200 jobs.\n\nThe news resulted in an immediate call for federal assistance from the province's premier.\n\n\"I want to reiterate that there is no way -- no way -- that the federal government should not invest in Bombardier, in the CSeries,\" Philippe Couillard said in Quebec.\n\n\"If the auto industry has been supported by taxpayer money, which is fine, then the aeronautical industry of Montreal needs also to be supported.\"\n\nBombardier employs about 74,000 people around the world, according to its website.\n\nThe cuts will be partly offset by hiring in certain areas, particularly as Bombardier plans to ramp up production of the new CSeries jets, the company said.

Its milestones include the X-1 (first aircraft to break the sound barrier), the X-5 (first plane with variable sweep wings), the X-13 (first use of jet power for vertical takeoffs and landings), the X-31A (could turn 180 degrees in the air), and many more. The program was synonymous with the dawn of the jet age and continued building airplanes into the last decade. Its last plane was the unmanned X-51A \"Waverider,\" designed to fly at six times the speed of sound (roughly 4,000 mph) by riding its own shockwave. Like many x-planes, the Waverider was developed with military applications in mind.\n\nNow NASA is interested in making flying a better experience for the rest of us. The agency plans a \"bold series of new experimental aircraft\" to develop the technologies needed to cut the fuel consumption of commercial airplanes in half, reduce emissions by 75 percent, promote the use of renewable energy, and reduce noise levels around airports.\n\nThose are ambitious, noble goals: Aviation's responsible for 1.5 percent of the planet's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and demand for air travel is booming in the developing world. Planes have to get more efficient -- the global aviation industry just last week agreed to a four percent reduction in fuel consumption by 2028 -- and NASA should be helping that effort.\n\nStill, it's exciting to see that the aeronautics agency isn't all about cutting carbon. It's already got its next x-plane in mind, and this one, like so many of its predecessors, is all about going fast.\n\nWe've been flying at subsonic speeds like total lame-o's since the Concorde left service in 2003. Today's airliners typically fly around Mach .8 (~600 mph), leaving you stuck in that middle seat way longer than you'd like to be there. NASA thinks it's time to remedy that. The agency plans \"to initiate the detailed design and build of the world's first low-boom flight demonstrator.\"\n\nThe problem with flying faster than the speed of sound is just how terrible it is for everyone on the ground. The sonic boom that results from an aircraft breaking the sound barrier is unpleasant and occasionally damaging. In the 1950s and 60s, when the military's supersonic jets were shooting all over the place, Americans filed nearly 40,000 claims against the Air Force, according to Lawrence R. Benson's book Quieting the Boom: The Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstrator and the Quest for Quiet Supersonic Flight. Complaints ranged from broken glass to dead pets and livestock driven insane.\n\nThat led the FAA in 1973 to ban supersonic commercial flights over the United States, saying \"present technology cannot deal in a practical way with the sonic boom problem.\" That's why the Concorde stuck to routes between the East Coast and Europe, only firing up to full speed over the Atlantic and limiting its earning potential.\n\nBut if you can get rid of the sonic boom, or at least drastically reduce its negative effects, the US and other countries that imitated its ban might be persuaded to allow the revival of supersonic flight. That's the goal of the \"low boom\" aircraft, NASA says: \"to overcome the sonic boom barrier and open the door for development of a new generation of supersonic civil transport aircraft.\"\n\nNASA hasn't said much about how that plane will reduce the boom, except that it will try to validate work it's done in the wind tunnel. The general idea is to shape the plane so the shockwave it produces isn't quite so rough for those on the ground. The plan right now is to produce a preliminary design review in FY 2016, with a detailed design in FY 2017. The agency's not the only one working on this problem: Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, have shown concepts for supersonic aircraft in the past few years, and billionaire-backed Aerion Corp. plans to deliver a supersonic business jet around 2023.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, there will be a nice circularity to NASA's revived program: The first x-plane sent Chuck Yeager past Mach 1. The next one could let everyone else follow him there.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

So far this year Boeing, America's biggest aerospace group, has suffered the two biggest daily falls in its share price yet seen, caused by downgrades to its production forecasts and news that the SEC was investigating its accounting methods.\n\nBut its woes look as nothing compared with those of Bombardier, a Canadian maker of planes and trains. On February 17th it announced net losses of $5.3billion in 2015, mainly due to write-downs, and a $10 billion shrinking of its order book since 2014. Many are asking if the company will run out of cash.\n\nThe trainmaking division is doing fine. But Bombardier's aerospace division, which made only $138m in profit in 2015 before $5.4 billion of write-downs, is giving its executives nightmares. Those parts that used to generate good profits are stalling. The market for business jets, particularly large ones, is suffering from slower growth in emerging economies, says Stephen Trent of Citigroup, a bank. Bombardier has also been losing ground against more specialised competitors such as Gulfstream and Mitsubishi in the market for small and medium-sized business jets.\n\nThe company's biggest problem, though, is the CSeries, its project to develop a 100- to 150-seater plane to break the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in this area (see table). Three years late and costing $5.4 billion to develop instead of the $3.5 billion originally forecast, the project has been soaking up cash. Although the plane's entry into service is planned for later this year, it still has not been awarded safety certification by authorities in America and Europe. Ruthless pricing by Airbus of its A320neo and Boeing of its 737 MAX, as well as fears over Bombardier's financial viability, have made the company's cashflow situation worse by discouraging new orders. Until Air Canada announced the purchase of up to 75 of the plane's larger CS300 variant, on February 17th, there had been no orders since 2014.\n\nIt will be a long haul before Bombardier recoups its costs on the project, says Bjorn Fehrm at Leeham Company, an aviation consultant. The first 15 planes produced this year will cost Bombardier $60m each to make, he says, but will sell for just $30m or so. It will take until 2020 for Bombardier to break even (not counting development costs), at around the time when the 250th plane is delivered. The CSeries' fuel efficiency may bring it more orders if the oil price goes back up. But so far, including Air Canada's order, it has sold only 318.\n\nTo keep it going in the meantime, Bombardier needs cash. Last year it offered Airbus a majority stake in the CSeries project, but was rebuffed. Instead, the company's home province, Quebec, offered C$1.3 billion ($1 billion) for 49.5% of the CSeries venture and a further C$1.5 billion from its pension fund for a stake in the rail division.\n\nThis is unlikely to be enough. So the question is, where will the next cash injection come from? Airbus is unlikely to change its mind, and Boeing is busy sorting out its own problems. An investment from COMAC, a Chinese state-owned planemaker which is also trying to bust in on the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, and with which Bombardier signed a co-operation agreement in 2011, seems too politically toxic to be feasible. The Canadian electorate would not want to see a national champion fall into Chinese hands.\n\nSo a further bail-out from either the Canadian federal or Quebec provincial government, in return for a stake in the CSeries, is most likely. This week Bombardier announced 7,000 job losses; the fear of even bigger cuts may force politicians' hands. If so, taxpayers will not see a return on their investment for years, if ever.", "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Some suppliers to Boeing and Airbus are putting the brakes on expansion plans, saying they fear that planned increases in production by the big plane makers may not be sustained in the face of slowing growth and low oil prices.\n\nConsider AccraFab Inc, a precision manufacturer in Spokane, Washington, that produces parts for Boeing's 787 and other aircraft.\n\nIt recently spent $500,000 for high-speed punching equipment that can stamp complex metal cutouts used in housings for cockpit display screens, said President Greg Konkol.\n\n\"We're dragging our feet on two more investments,\" worth about $1.3 million, Konkol said. \"We know we have to ramp up, but we're being conservative about investing too much and getting overextended.\"\n\nThe situation is similar at Tech Manufacturing, a maker of milled wing and airframe pieces that supplies Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier , Embraer , Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and business jet makers.\n\n\"We're taking a wait-and-see attitude,\" said Frank Kimball, senior vice president of sales at the company, located in Wright City, Missouri.\n\nTech Manufacturing bought three new machines in the last five years, he said, but now is \"looking very carefully at investing.\" Executives have priced other new equipment they want, he said. \"But it depends on some of these bids coming in.\"\n\nThe comments, made in interviews during a supplier conference in Seattle last week, reflect growing caution among the thousands of companies that produce parts for plane makers.\n\nBoeing and Airbus continue to forecast strong growth, and say they are fully committed to ambitious plans to increase production sharply through the end of the decade.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg dismissed investor concerns about a cyclical downturn on Wednesday, noting large backlogs of orders are enough to keep factories running for many years without selling another plane.\n\n\"This is fundamentally different than anything you have seen in history,\" Muilenburg said at an investor conference. \"We're not seeing any cyclical behavior.

But there's reason to believe it may yet recover\n\nA Bombardier CSeries CS100 jet. (Clement Sabourin/AFP/Getty)\n\nFor a while now, Bombardier has looked like a doomed company. Its share price was down more than 65% in the past year, dipping below $1 at the end of January to the lowest level in 25 years. The company announced plans this week to cut 7,000 jobs worldwide over the next two years, about 10% of its workforce, and it's seeking another bailout, even after a cash infusion from the Quebec government last fall. The trouble lies with Bombardier's CSeries commercial jet, which has been beset by delays, cost overruns and volatile fuel prices since it began in 2003.\n\nBut there may finally be a reason for optimism. Air Canada has signed a letter of intent with Bombardier to place 45 firm orders for the CS300 aircraft, along with the option to purchase up to 30 CS100 planes, a slightly smaller aircraft. The contract is worth an estimated $3.8 billion and marks an end to a 17-month-long dry spell in which Bombardier was unable to drum up any serious interest. One reason international carriers have hesitated with the CSeries is that even domestic Canadian airlines had yet to make a commitment, according to aviation consultant Robert Kokonis. But the agreement with Air Canada could be a game-changer for Bombardier, encouraging other aircraft purchasers to take a closer look. Indeed, even with massive job cuts planned, Bombardier anticipates devoting more resources to the CSeries. No one is expecting the CSeries to be a market leader at this point, but it may yet find a niche.\n\nAfter years of turmoil, will Bombardier's CSeries finally take off?\n\nPrior to Air Canada's interest, Bombardier had secured 243 firm orders, just shy of its target of 300 by the second quarter of 2016. But for all of the bad press the company has received, there's one thing many industry analysts and aviation experts agree on: The CSeries is a damned decent plane. The two models of the narrow-bodied single-aisle plane are quiet and 20% more fuel efficient than other similar-sized jets, while also offering decent leg room, unlike other planes of the same size. Pilots for Swiss International Air Lines -- the first airline to take delivery of the CSeries -- are currently in training to operate the craft. Fred Cromer, president of Bombardier's commercial aircraft unit, was bullish about the prospects on a conference call with analysts in December. \"It flew exactly as advertised, and they were pretty excited about it,\" he said of the Swiss airline's experience. \"I think it was all thumbs-up from their point of view.\" The market for narrow-body aircraft such as the CSeries is fairly robust; the order backlog for such planes is much larger than for bigger aircraft, according to a recent Bloomberg report. The demand is coming from carriers in densely populated areas of Continental Europe, Asia and even the U.S., where shorter regional flights are increasingly common.\n\nBut there are still two major hurdles for Bombardier to overcome to secure more orders. The first is that the company has to deliver its next slate of planes on time; AirBaltic is scheduled to receive 13 from Bombardier by the second half of the year. \"There's nothing more they can do at this point,\" Kokonis says. \"They just have to execute now.\" Carriers need to see more evidence of how the jets work in real-world conditions, and positive reactions from Swiss Air Lines and AirBaltic could entice customers.\n\nThe second problem is that Bombardier hasn't been able to compete on price. The 110-seat CSeries has a list price of US$63 million, while its slightly larger counterpart sells for $72 million. Bombardier's competitors, mainly Airbus and Boeing, are able to offer steep discounts -- sometimes up to 50% -- but the smaller, debt-plagued Bombardier has been constrained. But management has been signalling it could change its tune on pricing. Former CEO Pierre Beaudoin believed the jets could demand a premium, while Cromer told Bloomberg in December that he \"know[s] what it takes to win large orders\" and acknowledged that new customers are \"going to expect an aggressive deal.\"\n\nDelta Air Lines, for one, is (mildly) interested. \"We actually think at the right price it's quite a competitive airplane, particularly given the engine technology,\" said CEO Richard Anderson on a quarterly conference call in January. \"We're taking a very serious look at it.\" Other industry players are supportive too. \"CSeries is a fantastic 100-seat airplane,\" Bob Leduc, president of engine maker Pratt & Whitney, told Reuters this week. \"They can get a couple of orders, and I think if they do, they will be fine.\"\n\nThe inside story of Bombardier's $4-billion gamble on a super quiet jet\n\nThe company's cash position is also stable for this year, at least, giving it some time to sort through these issues. The CSeries is buoyed right now by Bombardier's transportation wing, which is comparatively healthy. \"They have some contracts to burn though,\" says Chris Higgins, an analyst at Morningstar. \"That unit has long-term viability without major changes.\" It's also cushioned by funding from Quebec, of course. The company received a US$1-billion bailout from the provincial government, which took at 49.5% stakes in the CSeries program, and a US$1.5-billion injection from Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec in exchange for 30% of the transportation unit. Bombardier is in talks with the federal government to secure even more financial aid, and the market believes the company won't be allowed to fail. \"My perspective is that they're not going away,\" says Chris Murray, an AltaCorp Capital analyst.\n\nStill, radical changes might be necessary, according to some analysts. Control of the company rests with the Bombardier and Beaudoin families, who, if the company's current situation is any guide, have not been the most astute owners. Although Bombardier hired Alain Bellemare as CEO in 2015, the company's dual-class share arrangement means control remains with the founding families. \"The dual-class share [structure] will be forced to collapse,\" says Higgins. \"In the grand scene of things, that would be positive.\" That would free management to pursue new avenues that could prove to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, such as splitting up the aviation and transportation divisions. Indeed, the federal government is said to be reluctant to provide financial assistance without changes to Bombardier's management structure, according to reports.\n\nHiggins, for one, is expecting big changes soon: \"They cannot come out, after share prices that have sunk so low, to say that they're still working on things.\"\n\nThe Biggest Family-run Businesses in Canada\n\nMORE ABOUT BOMBARDIER:\n\nBRP's big bet: selling boomer bikers a three-wheeled motorcycle How Bombardier's original innovation, the Ski-Doo, was invented Bombardier's shakeup was a long time coming.

When Boeing reported fourth quarter results in late January, the company announced that it would cut its production rate on the 777 from 8.3 per month to 7 per month beginning later this year. The 777 is a cash cow for Boeing, and Muilenburg said today that 2016 production of is completely sold out and at the new production rate 2017 production is 80% sold out and that the company has \" a dozen campaigns underway\" to boost that total.\n\nThat's fine, but the new 777X is not scheduled for delivery until 2020, and that leaves Boeing with some gaps in its changeover to the new plane.\n\nMuilenburg did not comment directly on the reported SEC investigation, but did defend the program accounting method Boeing uses to spread the costs of developing its 787 over sales of the planes.

Apart from trans-Pacific routes, PAL will also use the A350s for new non-stop flights that it plans to launch between Manila and Paris, Rome and Frankfurt, he added.\n\nFor his part, Bregier said he was pleased to welcome PAL as the latest airline to select the A350 XWB (extra wide body).\n\n\"The A350 XWB has set new standards, combining extra-long range capability with the lowest operating costs of any aircraft in the larger twin aisle category,\" the Airbus chief said. \"Passengers flying with PAL can look forward to the new levels of comfort offered by the aircraft, with a wider and quieter cabin, and more personal space for all.\"\n\nThe A350 XWB is the world's latest generation airliner and the newest member of the Airbus wide body family.

The start-up will commence operations in the third quarter of 2016 using leased Airbus A320 equipment, but will not be domiciled in Costa Rica as had been previously suggested.\n\nLatin American airline holding company Grupo Viva is to formally launch its first Viva Airlines business next month, its Chief Executive Officer Joe Mohan revealed to Routesonline at this year's Routes Americas forum in San Juan, Puerto Rico ahead of his keynote address to delegates. The start-up will commence operations in the third quarter of 2016 using leased Airbus A320 equipment, but will not be domiciled in Costa Rica as had been previously suggested.\n\nThe launch is the first of three new international airline operations that will be introduced across Latin America by Grupo Viva as part of a five year development plan. The business is backed by Irelandia Aviation, regarded as the world's premier low-cost carrier (LCC) developer and who has developed five successful operations across the world - Ryanair in Europe, Tiger Airways in Asia, Allegiant Air in the USA and the existing Viva brands of VivaAerobus in Mexico and VivaColombia in Colombia.\n\n\"We are currently exploring opportunities across the region but have agreed on our initial launch market and will make an announcement in the country probably by the middle of March,\" said Mohan. \"There are a number of variables in our decision making framework that need to be fulfilled and that has lead us to switch our plans a little.\"\n\nThe plan was to establish Viva CAM, a Costa Rica-based business, but market conditions and further analysis has diluted its interest. \"I still think we will see this come to fruition. We are still excited by the Central American market, but not right now,\" explained Mohan.\n\n\"Although the Central American market is the same size of Colombia, where we already have an effective Viva operation, it is split between seven smaller country markets and the current supply of seats has not grown over the past ten years. There are also significant tax and airport fee constraints that mean we couldn't achieve the price points we require to stimulate the market effectively,\" he added.\n\nThe Grupo Viva model aims to bring strong synergies to the three proposed start-up businesses that will enable them to better compete more effectively against legacy rivals than standalone carriers. \"We bring an umbrella that can look after common functions, including aircraft acquisition and simplify the business structure,\" said Mohan.\n\nAccording to the executive the Viva model means its airlines would be able to achieve ballpark figures of around 200 per cent in terms of lower costs per seats versus established rivals. \"We offer significant cost advantages versus the legacy carriers,\" he said.\n\nWhile remaining tight-lipped on plans, Mohan acknowledged that markets such as Ecuador and Argentina do appeal to the group, while Peru was also considered previously prior to the earlier selection of Costa Rica. \"We also think that Cuba could be a great opportunity for us. It is an interesting place and with no local carrier registered to fly to the US it provides an excellent opportunity to take advantage of the new traffic rights between the countries,\" he said.\n\nThe development plans of Grupo Viva and ambitions of Irelandia Aviation will require an investment in new aircraft. VivaAerobus last year welcomed the first of up to 52 new A320s it has on order (12 A320ceo and 40 A320neo) and while this order may still be transferred to support this growth vision, Mohan suggested that a new order could be placed and welcomed Boeing to discussion table.\n\n\"We are at an early stage but could consider a commitment for around 50 aircraft to support our five-year development plan. Any commitment would need to be at this scale to get the manufacturers' attention, especially if Boeing were to take us seriously and consider talking to a current Airbus customer,\" he said.\n\nIt is unclear if the airline at this stage will consider current or new engine options from the manufacturers. \"We are not seeing much discount from Airbus and Boeing for the ceo and Next Generation offerings,\" added Mohan.\n\nRegister for Routes Americas in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 17 - 19 February 2016", "Airbus -- the company that patented the concept of stacking passengers on top of each other in a crowded tube flying at hundreds of miles per hour thousands of feet above the ground -- has recently applied for a pair of airplane seat patents that simultaneously look to increase customer comfort while stripping away what little room remains.\n\nLet's deal with the more passenger-friendly patent first: an airplane seat that could accommodate humans of just about any size.\n\nThe Airbus patent for a \"Re-Configurable Passenger Bench Seat\" is just what it sounds like. Rather than airplane seating being determined by individual bucket seats bolted together to form rows, this patent imagines a bench seat with a variety of option of for seatbelts.\n\nSo, per Airbus's always slightly disconcerting patent application drawings, you could fit two larger adults with an armrest between:\n\nOr you could seat three lanky adults in matching unitards:\n\nOr a pair of unitard-clad adults bookending a pair of what we believe are supposed to be children, but may just be those \"child angel\" dolls that passengers in Thailand are trying to put in their own seats:\n\nAirbus says the idea is to provide a seat that can be quickly adjusted, allowing for multiple permutations. However, we don't expect to see flight attendants going around making tweaks at customers' demands. Instead, this is likely being seen as something that airlines could use as an upsell: Want to fly in a row with your two young kids and your spouse? Fine, but that will be $X for seat customization.\n\nSpeaking of squeezing into a row, the second Airbus patterns involves gaining more storage space for your carry-ons, but at the expense of legroom.\n\nAs things stand now, travelers throw their big carry-on bag (usually those awful, inflexible, too-large rolling suitcases that you don't really need and take up too much room) in the overhead bins, and then stow things like purses and laptop bags under the seat in front of them.\n\nLong-legged passengers often choose to forgo that second form of storage in favor of having somewhere, anywhere, to put their feet. But Airbus apparently doesn't care about you and your limbs.\n\nThis second Airbus patent [via USA Today] takes secondary storage out from under the seat in front of you and puts it under your seat cushion:\n\nYour first thought might be \"Oh, cool... now I don't have to choose between legroom and storing my laptop bag,\" until you realize that you don't have to choose, because you can't choose.\n\nAs you can see from this second diagram, that under-seat storage space means the person behind you has even less room for their legs than they did before:\n\nWhat's more, while the idea of a fixed, under-butt storage area gives passengers a place to stow their carry-on that doesn't involve leaving it on the floor where it can be kicked, spilled on, or spill out its contents, it also means that accessing that storage space mid-flight would require the passenger to get out of their seat, turn around and rummage through the space.\n\nAirplanes are already tightly packed enough. I don't know if I need my neighbor's rear-end in my face while he's hunched over looking through his bag for the pretzels he bought at the airport.", "SINGAPORE: Airbus and Boeing announced billion-dollar deals at Asia's largest airshow in Singapore on Wednesday, underscoring the region's role as a driver of industry growth despite greater caution among plane buyers.\n\nEurope's Airbus said it had won an $1.85 billion deal for the purchase of six A350-900s by Philippine Airlines (PAL), the flag carrier of one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.\n\nUS-based Boeing meanwhile said it had won a commitment from China's Okay Airways to buy 12 aircraft for $1.3 billion despite a weakening Chinese economy.\n\n\"The Chinese people are very good at saving,\" Okay Airways chairman Wang Shusheng told reporters. \"It doesn't matter if the economy has worsened, they will still travel.\"\n\nTony Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, said ahead of the Singapore show that airlines in the region may try to push back their orders due to softer profits.\n\nAirline savings from low fuel costs are being eroded by hedging losses and a strong dollar, Tyler said, noting that the greenback climbed 20 per cent over the past 18 months.\n\nWith Asia-Pacific accounting for 40 per cent of global air cargo, regional carriers have been badly hit by the global economic slowdown, worsening the impact of competition from Gulf carriers, the IATA chief added.\n\n\"We want to sell as many aircraft in Asia as much as possible but we also want to settle in Asia and have industrial facilities, research and engineering centres,\" Marwan Lahoud, chairman of the French aerospace industries association GIFAS, told AFP in an interview yesterday.\n\n\"We want to amplify what we have started already - selling, designing and manufacturing in Asia,\" said Lahoud, who is also a member of the group executive committee of the Airbus Group.\n\nIndustry players say travel demand in Asia is still there, boosted by the region's growing middle class, but that the mega deals of previous years are gone.\n\nIn a statement issued this year, Airbus said it won 421 orders from 17 airlines and lessors in Asia in 2015, representing 39 per cent of the company's net order intake for the year.\n\nBoeing this week forecast that the world will need 38,050 planes in the next 20 years, with 38 per cent of the deliveries to Asia, 21 per cent to North America and 19 percent to Europe.\n\nIn other Singapore deals, a US leasing firm ordered 20 aircraft from Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp in a transaction potentially worth more than $900 million.\n\nPAL also said it separately signed a $600-million order with Rolls-Royce for Trent XWB engines to power its six A350s.", "Airbus and Boeing announced modest aircraft orders at the Singapore Airshow on Wednesday that indicated a lull in demand for the big manufacturers after the 2014 show hauled in more than $30-billion of deals.\n\nAirbus announced an order for six A350-900s, valued at $1.8-billion (U.S.) at list prices from Philippine Airlines. Boeing announced a deal for 12 of its 737 jets with a privately-owned Chinese carrier Okay Airways, valued at $1.3-billion.\n\nBoeing and Airbus executives at the show have voiced confidence that air travel in Asia will continue to grow strongly. They said no Asian airlines had deferred orders already placed.\n\nBut some industry experts say the slump in oil prices over the past several months means airlines will keep their older less-fuel efficient aircraft for longer and buy fewer new jets.\n\n\"One of the reasons why the order books are full is because the fuel price was high, so there was an incentive to buy the more fuel-efficient planes and get rid of the old ones,\" said David Stewart, an aviation and aerospace adviser at ICF International.\n\n\"But now the fuel price is low, so some airlines will keep their older planes longer, and therefore not need the new. It's a quiet time for all of us.\"\n\nAirlines are also deterred by the filled order books of both Airbus and Boeing, that could mean a long wait for the delivery of airplanes, Stewart said.\n\nOkay Airways Wang Shusheng said his company's order for 737s is not part of a deal Boeing signed with China last year to supply 300 aircraft worth $38-billion.\n\nHe said the order will \"further modernize our fleet and ensure we operate the most efficient fleet well into the future\".\n\nBoth jet manufacturers made their announcements on the second day of the Singapore Airshow, which ends Feb. 21. More than 1,000 companies are taking part.\n\nThe previous show in 2014 generated deals worth $32-billion, and organizers will release this year's total after the event's trade period ends on Friday.\n\nBoeing said Monday that it had no deferrals in Asia and forecasts demand for 3,750 new airplanes in Southeast Asia valued at $550-billion over the next 20 years. Of the forecast demand, 76 per cent will be for single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.\n\nAirbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier brushed off fears of a downturn in orders at a press conference Tuesday.\n\nThe company forecasts demand for 12,810 new airplanes in the Asia-Pacific area, valued at $2-trillion over the next 20 years. That represents 40 per cent of forecast global demand for about 32,600 airplanes over the same period.\n\nPassenger numbers in Asia are expected by Airbus to grow by 5.6 per cent annually, with China forecast to post double digit growth.", "Poor regulation and a shortage of technical expertise are opening cracks Amid the smoking exhaust ports, advanced avionics and parents taking photographs of their children in mock-up cockpits, real business deals are made at air-shows throughout the world.\n\nThe Singapore Airshow, Asia's biggest, is no different. In 2014, 1,018 companies from 47 countries secured deals worth US$32 billion (Bt1.1 trillion) at the biannual showcase, a 3 per cent increase from the previous edition.\n\nIncreasing participation - 14 per cent more companies took part in2014 compared to 2012 - is one of many indications that Asia's aviation sector has flourished in recent years.\n\nAsia's fleet of commercial aircraft has doubled in the last decade to nearly 6,000, plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing estimate.\n\nAirlines in the Asia-Pacific will need 12,500-to-15,000 new aircraft in the coming 20 years, the firms predict.\n\n\"If you look at the traffic growth and manufacturers' forecasts, then it is pretty clear that Asia-Pacific is the engine driving global airliner sales these days,\" says Tim Robinson, the editor-in-chief of Aerospace Magazine.\n\nBut behind the unprecedented growth in air travel, there are growing concerns that Asia's safety infrastructure is not keeping up.\n\nAn International Air Transport Association (IATA) safety report for 2014 showed there were 14 aviation accidents in the Asia Pacific, more than any other region in the world.\n\nLast year saw improvement for Asian airlines, according to the latest IATA report released on Monday, but the region still had a higher rate of serious jet crashes per flight than Europe or North America.\n\nWhile Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Australia's Qantas have topped recent aviation safety rankings, the German-based Jacdec aviation database puts five Asian airlines in the bottom six of its 2016 safety ranking.\n\nRegulatory oversights and weak safety management systems were the areas most responsible for air traffic accidents in Asia between 2010 and 2014, the IATA has said.\n\n\"The regulators ... have not kept up with the manpower and technical capacity needed to regulate so many aircraft and flights\" says Alan Khee-Jin Tan, a professor specialising in aviation law at the National University of Singapore. Poor regulation has become an acute problem for Thailand, one of the region's biggest tourist destinations.\n\nThailand's aviation authority was downgraded separately by the United Nation's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and by the US Federal Aviation Administration in 2015.\n\nThe US body deemed that Thailand \"lacks laws or regulations necessary to oversee air carriers in accordance with minimum international standards\". The other area highlighted by the IATA - the lack of a systematic approach to managing safety - includes problems with training and maintenance.\n\n\"The boom in aircraft orders means that there is a shortage of notonly pilots, but maintenance personnel,\" Tan says.\n\nFlying schools in Indonesia - which has had a persistently poor record on aviation safety - are struggling to cope with a demand for some 600 new pilots every year.\n\nAfter the crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501 from Indonesia in December 2014, investigators called for better pilot training for unexpected situations during flight.\n\nBlack box recordings revealed, among other issues, \"ambiguous commands\" by the pilot and co-pilot when they were faced with a malfunctioning rudder control system. The aircraft's maintenance record found 23 occurrences of rudder problems in the last 12 months, but the problem was left unresolved.\n\nObservers highlight two other areas of concern for air passengers in Asia: the expansion of low-cost carriers (LCC) and the physical infrastructure at airports across the region.\n\n\"Safety doesn't come cheap and does require investment in training, maintenance and equipment - even if you are a 'low-cost' carrier,\" says Robinson.\n\n\"You can have a slick marketing campaign, great social media and superb prospects for growth but it only takes one accident to damage your reputation and brand.\"\n\nThe investigations by ICAO revealed severe gaps in safety standards.\n\nEven basic things like having a physical manual was found lacking for some of these budget airlines,\" says Pichaya Waithayak, an aviation consultant and former pilot at Thai Airways.\n\nThe growth in LCCs may be a \"blessing in disguise\" however, Pichaya adds. \"This unprecedented growth is also prompting unprecedented inspections.\" LCCs in the region point out that safety is a top priority for them.\n\nKamarudin Meranun, co-founder and group chief executive of AirAsia X - a company in the AirAsia group, said in a statement that safety was a \"core value\" of the firm.\n\n\"AirAsia X operates according to the most stringent standards in the industry,\" he said.\n\nInfrastructure, meanwhile, is \"at breaking point\" at some major regional hubs, particularly at Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta and Manila Ninoy Aquino Airports, with smaller airports also a concern, Tan says.\n\n\"The growth of LCCs and aviation in the region means that these smaller airports will get much more traffic,\" Pichaya says. \"There are horror stories that pilots share about these smaller hubs, whether its wildlife wandering on the runway or non-existent landing lights.\"\n\nMost analysts agree that governments across Southeast Asia are beginning to take steps to meet safety standards.\n\nThailand's military government set up a task force to meet the challenges of the ICAO downgrade.\n\nA similar step by the Filipino government several years ago resulted in the ICAO removing the country from its \"significant safety watch list\" in 2013.\n\n\"I believe the political will is there,\" says Tan. \"This will be a huge challenge, but is absolutely necessary.\"", "Bombardier unveils its CSeries jets on March 7, 2013 in Mirabel, Que. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson\n\nIt was an astonishing bit of candour, uttered as it was by the president and CEO of one of the largest transportation companies in the world. The Quebec government had just announced a $1.3-billion investment in the C Series, the new line of commercial jets from Montreal-based rail and aerospace company Bombardier. Plagued by technical delays, cost overruns and nagging existential questions about its very purpose, the C Series has long been a source of unwelcome headlines for the company.\n\nLanding on the same day as the company's ugly third-quarter report -- Bombardier had lost nearly $5 billion, mostly having to do with writedowns on the C Series -- the $1.3-billion government investment\u00ad, equivalent to about $160 for every man, woman and child in the province, was meant to be a bit of good news in an otherwise gloomy day for the company. Bombardier president and CEO Alain Bellemare spoke to journalists following the announcement, one of whom noted that as recently as July, management had assured investors the company had enough cash to see the C Series into production. Now the Quebec government was investing, and the company was petitioning the federal government to do the same. \"I'm having trouble understanding what happened,\" the journalist said.\n\n\"That's an excellent question,\" Bellemare responded to the non-question, in his raspy French bonhomie. \"Actually, I wonder that too.\"\n\nRelated: Why Quebec's Bombardier bailout isn't as crazy as it sounds\n\nLeft unsaid in Bellemare's ensuing explanation was how the company was able to secure the money from a government in the depths of austerity measures mere months after saying it wouldn't need financial assistance for an airplane project that is 2\u00bd years late, US$2.2 billion over budget and sorely lacking in confirmed orders.\n\nEven more gobsmacking to analysts and observers: that Bombardier was able to secure the funding without relinquishing its corporate governance structure, despite having lost nearly 90 per cent of its value since June 2008. This dual-class share structure ensures that the Bombardier family and that of company scion Laurent Beaudoin remain in control of the board; the company has had a CEO from the Beaudoin or Bombardier families for 66 of its 73 years in business.\n\nJ. Armand Bombardier, 52, designer of the Bombardier snowmobile, stands beside the latest model on the production line of his Valcourt, Quebec, factory, 60 miles east of Montreal. (Granby la voix de l'Est/CP)\n\nThe power the Bombardier-Beaudoin clan wields over Bombardier the company is surpassed only by their secrecy. Very little is known about the family dynamics at play behind this crown jewel of Quebec Inc. The shares are controlled by the four children of Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the mechanic and inventor who in 1937 gave the world the snowmobile. Claire Bombardier Beaudoin, J.R. Andr\u00e9 Bombardier, Janine Bombardier and Huguette Bombardier Fontaine control the majority of Bombardier's voting rights.\n\nYet despite being the picture of discretion, the families are reportedly frustrated that the battered share price has drained much of their wealth -- since 2008 the value of their Bombardier stake has dropped from $2.2 billion to $260 million. And according to a source close to the family, who spoke to Maclean's on condition of anonymity, they put the blame squarely on Pierre Beaudoin, 53, the company's erstwhile CEO and its current executive chairman.\n\nPierre is the son of Laurent Beaudoin, who turned his father-in-law Joseph-Armand Bombardier's fledgling snowmobile company into a global transportation brand. Pierre joined the company in 1985 and became its CEO in 2008. Pierre became Bombardier's executive chairman in 2015, after stepping down as CEO.\n\n\"The families are very disappointed in Pierre. They're wealthy, so it's more a question of pride. They've taken the stock collapse almost as a personal slight,\" says the source close to the family.\n\nAs president of Bombardier Aerospace, Pierre launched the Learjet 85 business airplane in 2007. Less than a year later, as Bombardier CEO, he launched the C Series program. Today, the Learjet has been shelved, with the company incurring a $1.4-billion writedown last year on the shuttered project, while the C Series has only 243 confirmed sales. Meanwhile the company's new VIP business jets, the newest editions to the Global Express program launched in 1993, were meant to hit the market in 2016. That's been delayed by at least two years.\n\nWith the success of the C Series in doubt and Bombardier's share price dipping below a dollar in recent weeks, former executives at the company are irked. \"The reason the company is where it is today is because of the leadership,\" says a former Bombardier senior executive, who spoke to Maclean's on condition of anonymity. \"Pierre would never have been CEO of that company if he didn't have his name, period.\"\n\nFederal Transport Minister Marc Garneau speaks to staff at Bombardier's CS100 plant Friday, December 18, 2015 in Mirabel, Que. After years of delays and cost overruns, Bombardier's CSeries commercial aircraft has been certified by Canada's transportation regulator. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz\n\nNow, after so many stumbles, taxpayers are being asked once again to cough up. Bombardier will likely receive its infusion of federal cash. In 2008, the Conservative government approved a $350-million loan to cover research and development costs of the C Series. This loan, along with the $117 million from the Quebec government and $310 million from the British government\u00ad -- Bombardier Aerospace employs 6,000 people in Belfast\u00ad -- has yet to be repaid.\n\nDespite evident governance issues and bleak financial prospects, Bombardier remains \"a key anchor firm for Canada's aerospace industry,\" according to a recent government memo prepared for the Liberal government last fall. Translation: for all its warts, allowing Bombardier to fail would have enormous political implications for Justin Trudeau's government.\n\nHere's another translation. Rightly or wrongly, Bombardier will continue to exist thanks in large part to the Canadian taxpayer.\n\nRelated: Jason Kirby's idea for Bombardier: What if we let it fail?\n\nBombardier CEO Alain Bellemare, left to right, former CEO and executive chairman Pierre Beaudoin and President of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft Mike Arcamone stand in front of a CS300 before it's first test flight in Mirabel, Que., on Friday, February 27, 2015. (Ryan Remiorz/CP)\n\nIn many ways, the development of the C Series is entirely in line with the company's high-risk, high-reward history of either conquering market segments or conjuring them out of thin air. The company that became Bombardier was birthed in a garage in Valcourt, Que., a swath of wooded wilderness located about 120 km east of Montreal.\n\nIt was in this garage, in the depths of the priest-ridden era that was Quebec in the 1930s, where Joseph-Armand Bombardier invented the snowmobile. He envisioned a vehicle that would allow those priests (along with doctors, teachers and the like) to travel from village to snowbound village. By 1963, the nascent company was selling $10 million worth of the machines a year, mostly to recreational users. A new market was born.\n\nThough separated by nearly 80 years and innumerable levels of engineering complexity, the C Series aircraft shares certain traits with its comparatively humble Ski-Doo cousin. It is a brand-new airplane design, for one, the first such innovation in narrow-body aircraft in nearly 20 years.\n\nThe two C Series models, the CS100 and the larger CS300, have a seating range of 100 to 160 seats, a mostly unserved market between the 60-to-100 seat regional jet class and narrow-body behemoths like the Boeing 737. Its design, along with the use of composite production materials, allows for a more technologically advanced and much less thirsty airplane than its competitors.\n\nAs C Series president Rob Dewar pointed out during a tour of Bombardier's manufacturing facilities near Montreal, the C Series has bigger windows, larger storage bins, wider aisles, more headspace, a better cockpit and a quieter ride than anything else on the market.\n\nThe C Series is a potential game-changer, says U.S. aerospace consultant Ernie Arvai. \"Technically, it's a superb airplane, and it beats the other guys handily at the same size class. To some degree the C Series caused Airbus to re-enter the A320 class with the Neo. Airbus realized they had to be more competitive.\"\n\nThe problem is simply everything else. Adjusted for inflation, fuel prices are less than a third what they were when the C Series program was launched in 2007. The aircraft's 20 per cent savings in fuel consumption has suddenly become far less of a selling point.\n\nAnd the numerous production delays (the C Series was meant to be on the tarmac by 2013) has meant its competitors have been able to fill the market Bombardier itself created. France-based Airbus Group SE has been particularly damaging to C Series sales, with company COO John Leahy frequently disparaging the C Series in public\u00ad -- he recently described the program as an \"orphan\" -- and undercutting Bombardier in airline board rooms.\n\n\"There were several instances where Bombardier was hours from signing a deal and John came in and made an offer they couldn't refuse: a larger aircraft at a cheaper price,\" says Arvai.\n\nBombardier's CS100 assembly line is seen at the company's plant Friday, December 18, 2015 in Mirabel, Que. After years of delays and cost overruns, Bombardier's CSeries commercial aircraft has been certified by Canada's transportation regulator. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz\n\nIt speaks to another inherent problem for Bombardier. The company is attempting to sell a brand-new aircraft to typically conservative airline industry executives, in a market dominated by established, deep-pocketed players who can discount their wares far more than the Quebec-based company can.\n\nIf all those external headwinds weren't enough to thwart Bombardier's new aerospace ambitions, tensions and disruptions within the company's executive ranks only made the turbulence worse. According to the former Bombardier executive, who was involved in the development of the C Series, the problems with the aircraft were exacerbated by Pierre Beaudoin's management style. \"[Pierre] would tell people that he wanted to be challenged, but this would change when people actually challenged him.\"\n\nIn 2005, Bombardier business aircraft president Peter Edwards abruptly left the company, following a budget review during which, according to the executive, Edwards stood up to Pierre. This former executive and another say Edwards was pushed out.\n\n(Edwards declined to comment for this article. Bombardier spokesperson Isabelle Rondeau also declined to comment.)\n\nSeveral members of Bombardier's senior management left the company when Pierre became COO of Bombardier aerospace in 2001, and again when he became CEO in 2008. This in itself isn't unusual; new executives generally clean house when they are appointed. Yet according to the two former executives, Pierre Beaudoin had curious hiring criteria. Any new hires \"had one thing in common, which was they were French Canadian,\" the executive, who is still in the airline industry, says. \"This was totally different than his dad, who basically wanted the best executives to run the company, irrespective of where you come from.\" (The Bombardier spokeswoman also declined to comment on these claims.)\n\n\"Pierre is not his father. Let's just say that. Nice man, nice guy, but is a little bit over his head,\" says Arvai, who adds that this was evident in the marketing of the C Series. \"Orginally he believed that the airplane had such performance benefits that they could get a large premium for it. That was a lost opportunity. Bombardier should have taken a loss on first 50 airplanes, got the production line going, getting the airplanes up. And I think that was a strategic mistake by Pierre.\"\n\nBombardier's dual-class shares, which have existed since 1969, are a product of Joseph-Armand Bombardier's desire to keep the company under the control of the Bombardier and Beaudoin families. But when it came time for Joseph-Armand's son Laurent to select someone from the third generation to steer the company into the future, problems arose.\n\nAccording to the source close to the family, Pierre wasn't his father's chosen successor. Rather, Laurent Beaudoin wanted his daughter \u00c9laine to eventually lead the company. \"She is most like Laurent in terms of common sense and intellect,\" the source says. \"But he couldn't get her interested in the business.\" (On this question too, Bombardier spokesperson Rondeau declined to comment.) Today, \u00c9laine Beaudoin is a corporate director of Canam Group Inc. and serves on other corporate boards.\n\nAccording to this source, former Bombardier executive Raymond Royer, Laurent Beaudoin's right-hand man, advised his boss against grooming Pierre for the role of CEO. (Royer didn't return a request for comment.) Indeed, in 2009 Pierre himself told the business newspaper Les Affaires that when he was younger he wasn't interested in even working at Bombardier.\n\nOnce in, though, he took to the company with gusto. Among other things, he oversaw the rollout of the Sea-Doo personal watercraft in 1990, and was president and COO of the company's recreational products group by 1996. He was in charge of the entire company 12 years later.\n\nIn 2007, as president and COO of Bombardier Aerospace, Pierre helped launch the Learjet 85 program. As with the C Series aircraft, which launched eight months later, the Learjet was loaded with new features and built from composite materials -- \"an aircraft that is set to redefine the mid-size jet category,\" as Pierre put at the time.\n\nYet the plane was plagued with delays, and Bombardier paused the program in early 2015 before shelving it indefinitely last fall.\n\nMissteps aside, the Quebec government believes it is crucial to finance Bombardier and the C Series -- and strongly suggests the federal government do the same. Through Investissement Qu\u00e9bec, its investment arm, the Quebec government has bought a minority stake in the C Series program.\n\n\"Bombardier had three choices. It could have abandoned the product. It could have sold it lock, stock and barrel to another company. Or it finds partners who will ensure it stays in Quebec. That is what we decided and it's up to the federal government to do the same,\" says Jacques Daoust, who until a recent cabinet shuffle was Quebec's minister of the economy.\n\nThe federal government has yet to say definitively whether it will make a similar investment in Bombardier. \"There has to be a strong business case for making a federal investment and any assistance would have to be in the best interest of all Canadians,\" says Industry Canada spokesperson Sabrina Foran.\n\nWhen it comes to employment, Bombardier certainly has a compelling political argument. There are 41,750 people employed in the aerospace sector in Quebec, according to a 2014 study by the industry group A\u00e9ro Montr\u00e9al. Bombardier is the biggest employer in the industry. Much of the small- and medium-sized aerospace businesses rely on the company to buy their goods and services. Essentially, Bombardier has made itself too big to fail.\n\nBombardier workers look at the CS300 aircraft after it was unveiled at a news conference at its assembly facility in Mirabel, Quebec, March 7, 2013. (Christinne Muschi/Reuters)\n\nIn Bombardier's facility in Mirabel, the C Series production line hums along efficiently. Workers dart between fuselages, which are in various degrees of assembly; most of these planes will go to Swiss International Airlines, which bought a fleet of the planes early on. \"There is clear interest from Air Canada,\" says Bombardier spokesperson Isabelle Gauthier.\n\nC Series president Rob Dewar is optimistic that the federal government will reverse a recent decision and allow Porter Airlines to fly jets to and from Toronto's island airport. (In November Ottawa disallowed jets, which was a considerable setback for the C Series.) \"It's not done yet. Porter's working on it,\" Dewar says.\n\nOptimism for the C Series resonates up Bombardier's chain of command. Transport Canada recently certified the CS100; the test model that did the deed is now a flying sales pitch to prospective customers. And though there are only 243 confirmed orders, the sky is practically the limit. \"According to the analysis we've done, over the next 20 years there is an opportunity for 7,000 airplanes or so in the 100 to 150 [seat] category,\" says Bombardier commercial aircraft president Fred Cromer. The company is also less hidebound to the original pricing of the C Series. \"Pricing is an issue, and we understand what the issue is,\" Cromer says. \"We're trying to be a little bit more open about what we're doing here, and that's important, for better or worse.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pierre Beaudoin seems as entrenched as ever. A rumour circulated in a Reuters report that he was stepping down was quickly swatted aside by the company. After all, the Quebec government invested in the company without mandating a change in the company's governance structure. Perhaps Ottawa is next.", "Tony Tyler, general director of the International Air Transport Association, said at the Singapore Airshow that even though global oil prices had dropped and the US dollar had appreciated by about 20 per cent over the last 18 months, the positive effects on the airline sector were limited.\n\nHe said the Asia-Pacific region now accounted for 40 per cent of the world's cargo market but the business this year would be lower than its peak a few years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, low-cost airlines, which controlled 54 per cent of the market - the highest in the world - would face more intense competition.\n\nTyler will be in Bangkok today to say more about the outlook for aviation.\n\nKhaw Boon Wan, Singapore's minister of transport, warned that the gloomy economic outlook could portend a slowdown of air travel in the region. However, he believes that the sector will bounce back eventually, as the number of passengers in Asean has tripled from a decade ago while the number of routes has increased by 40 per cent to more than 1,500.\n\nIn the meantime, Singapore has managed to attract more investment for high aviation technology, as Pratt & Whitney has just opened a factory in Seletar Aerospace Park. The new facility will produce PurePower Geared Turbofan engines for Airbus, Bombardier and other aircraft makers. The island republic is also an attractive destination for airlines from China, as West Air recently introduced a new Chongqing-Singapore route, utilising the Airbus A320-200.\n\nAccording to air-show reports, Chinese airlines are expected to report large profits for 2015 thanks to lower oil prices and higher market demand.\n\nSpring Airlines said its income would increase by 50-60 per cent compared with 2014.\n\nThis budget airline has enjoyed the drop in oil prices as well as healthy demand in international markets.\n\nAir China predicted its income would jump by 60-80 per cent from 2014 for the same reasons. China Southern Airlines is on the same track with high hopes a 130-per-cent jump in revenue from 2014.\n\nMyanmar, which began opening up to the world in 2012 after decades of military rule, is gaining more international tourists. A total of 22 foreign airlines carried about 3.2 million passengers into the country last year. That number is expected to grow further this year and throughout the next decade.\n\nThai Smile Airways plans to begin operating flights from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Mandalay in October and to Yangon in December.\n\nNext month, Emirates plans to launch its first direct service to New Zealand, which will be claimed as the world's longest flight. The Dubai-Auckland flight will utilise the Boeing 777-200ER. Currently, Qantas' Sydney-Dallas route is the longest flight, using the Airbus A380. The new Emirates service of is expected to take 15 hours and 55 minutes eastbound from Dubai and 17 hours 15 minutes on the return flight from Auckland.\n\nKorean Air is scheduled to receive 16 passenger aircraft and five freighters this year.", "In the last year, airberlin saw an increase of 46 percent in passengers booking flights on the airline to Australia. Since 2012, airberlin and codeshare partner Etihad have seen the popularity of the service, which occurs 39 times weekly and includes one stop in Abu Dhabi (AUH) before going to one of four Australian destinations, steadily increase.\n\nTo celebrate, airberlin teamed with Tourism Australia to create the #seeaustralia Airbus, which will feature a kangaroo on the fuselage and fly short- and medium-haul airberlin flights for the next year.\n\n\"The kangaroo is synonymous with our country,\" said John O'Sullivan, managing director, Tourism Australia. \"It has always played an important role in how we promote Australia to the world, so we couldn't be happier that airberlin has given us the opportunity for our very own 'skippy' to welcome their German passengers as they step on board the plane.\"\n\nAirberlin is offering special Australia rates as part of the promotion until March 14, and also hosting a Facebook giveaway to win a vacation for two to Australia.

Boeing announced a deal for 12 of its 737 jets with a privately-owned Chinese carrier Okay Airways, valued at US$1.3 billion.\n\nBoeing and Airbus executives at the show have voiced confidence that air travel in Asia will continue to grow strongly. They said no Asian airlines had deferred orders already placed.\n\nBut some industry experts say the slump in oil prices over the past several months means airlines will keep their older less-fuel efficient aircraft for longer and buy fewer new jets.\n\n\"One of the reasons why the order books are full is because the fuel price was high, so there was an incentive to buy the more fuel-efficient planes and get rid of the old ones,\" said David Stewart, an aviation and aerospace adviser at ICF International.\n\n\"But now the fuel price is low, so some airlines will keep their older planes longer, and therefore not need the new.

General Atomics staff have been conducting the take-off and landing and handing over to French Air Force crews.\n\nStudies are planned for Reaper take-off and landing in France, the official said.\n\nTen French pilots and operators are undergoing four months' training for the Reaper at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, magazine Air & Cosmos reported. That training will help relieve the burden of three deployments of two months in the Barkhane operation for crews in the Belfort squadron.\n\nFrance will study options of fitting a French or US payload for electronic intelligence on the Reaper, the DGA official said.\n\nParis is due to sign with London in the next few weeks a memorandum of understanding for two-year development for a platform for a combat drone, dubbed unmanned combat air system, a second DGA official said. A contract is expected to be signed in June.\n\nThat contract is for the platform, not the mission payload, which is the critical element, Collet-Billon said. There will be two prototypes of the platform built \"de-risking\" -- one British, one French -- after the development phase. The Neuron technology demonstrator for a combat drone will continue test flights this year, feeding information for the UCAS, due to fly in 2025.\n\nAmong other work for aircraft, the ministerial investment committee is due in the next few weeks to approve an upgrade of 45 Mirage 2000D fighters, including arming with a canon.

Although Transport Canada tries to ensure the accuracy of the reports, it still considers them preliminary and \"subject to change.\"\n\nThe number of laser strikes on aircraft has been rising sharply in recent years.\n\nLast year, according to a Citizen analysis of the CADORS database, there were 663 laser strikes directed at aircraft in Canada -- a 32 per cent increase from 2014. The numbers have been climbing since 2008 when 80 laser incidents were reported by pilots in Canadian airspace.\n\nCapt. Dan Adamus, Canada Board president for the Air Line Pilots Association, International, called laser attacks a serious concern. \"When it happens, there's a big green glow -- it's usually a green laser -- that fills the cockpit,\" Adamus said. \"You can be looking for the runway, and you catch this light out of the corner of your eye, and your natural tendency is to look towards it.\"\n\nTwo pilots in the United States, he said, have lost their medical clearance to fly after suffering eye damage from cockpit laser strikes.\n\nIn Canada, pointing a laser at an aircraft is an offence under the federal Aeronautics Act, and those convicted can face up to five years in prison and a $100,000 fine.\n\nAdamus wants the federal government to make laser interference with an aircraft an offence under the Criminal Code, and launch the kind of public awareness campaign conducted by the F.B.I., which offered $10,000 for information that led to arrests.\n\n\"They have to get the word out,\" he said, \"because nine times out of 10, I think it's curious people with a laser, saying, 'I wonder if this will reach that aircraft.\"\n\nAdamus also wants the government to better regulate the sale of lasers, and limit the power output of handheld pointers -- sometimes known as laser pens -- to 5 milliwatts or less. More powerful devices should be tightly controlled, he said, and come with explicit warnings about the danger they pose.\n\nTransport Canada says it is working closely with police, other government departments and the aviation industry to reduce the number of laser incidents. The high-intensity light strikes are considered particularly dangerous during the take-off and landing phases of a flight, when pilots can least afford to be distracted or temporarily blinded.\n\nIn the Ottawa region, medevac helicopters, small planes and commercial jets have all been targeted.\n\nLast April, an Ornge helicopter flying from Pembroke Regional Hospital to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario reported being hit by a green laser coming from the vicinity of the Champlain Bridge.\n\nOne month later, the pilot of an Air Transat Airbus en route from Toronto to Venice said the plane's cabin was lit up by a green laser as it cruised at 31,000-feet over Ottawa. That same month, a WestJet Boeing 737, originating in Calgary, reported that it was targeted three times by a green laser as it approached Ottawa International Airport.\n\nTen of the local incidents reported last year involved members of the Ottawa Flying Club, one of whom was targeted by a green laser for a full 20 seconds.\n\nBryce Hanna, general manager of the club, said laser strikes pose \"a fundamental safety issue\" since many small aircraft have a single pilot on board. \"There's no one to take the controls so potentially the aircraft could even be lost because of that,\" Hanna said.\n\nLaser strikes are an international problem. Earlier this month, the Alitalia flight crew taking Pope Francis to Mexico reported a laser beam coming from the ground as the plane prepared to land in Mexico City. Days later, a Virgin Atlantic flight en route to New York from London turned back after laser light struck the eyes of the co-pilot.\n\nThe incident prompted the British Airline Pilots Association to demand that the government categorize powerful laser pointers as \"offensive weapons\" to aid in a police crackdown on their use against planes.\n\nThe number or reported laser strikes in Canada:\n\n2008: 80\n\n2009: 111\n\n2010: 182\n\n2011: 229\n\n2012: 357\n\n2013: 461\n\n2014: 502\n\n2015: 663*\n\n* Based on a Citizen analysis of Transport Canada's CADORS database.", "SINGAPORE -- Airbus and Boeing announced modest aircraft orders at the Singapore Airshow that indicated a lull in demand for the big manufacturers after the 2014 show hauled in more than $30 billion of deals.\n\nAirbus announced an order for six A350-900s, valued at $1.8 billion at list prices from Philippine Airlines.

More than 1,000 companies are taking part.\n\nThe previous show in 2014 generated deals worth $32 billion, and organizers will release this year's total after the event's trade period ends on Friday.\n\nBoeing said Monday that it had no deferrals in Asia and forecasts demand for 3,750 new airplanes in Southeast Asia valued at $550 billion over the next 20 years. Of the forecast demand, 76 per cent will be for single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.\n\nAirbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier brushed off fears of a downturn in orders at a press conference Tuesday.\n\nThe company forecasts demand for 12,810 new airplanes in the Asia-Pacific area, valued at $2 trillion over the next 20 years. That represents 40 per cent of forecast global demand for about 32,600 airplanes over the same period.\n\nPassenger numbers in Asia are expected by Airbus to grow by 5.6 per cent annually, with China forecast to post double digit growth.", "The market for spy planes and surveillance platforms is buoyant in Southeast Asia, where countries are facing off against China - and each other - in the resource-rich South China Sea, industry insiders at the Singapore Airshow said. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam have all been seeking information from suppliers, trade sources said, as maritime patrol aircraft and intelligence-gathering platforms become more of a priority.\n\nSome of the kit is needed for traditional activities such as counter-piracy, fisheries protection or disaster response, but China's growing assertiveness in the region's seas is looming increasingly large in the thinking of defence planners.\n\n\"They did not know that China was building artificial islands,\" said one industry source who regularly talks to the region's navies. \"They did not know that it had built a runway or put in missile launchers. They want to fix this.\"\n\nChina has been building runways and other infrastructure on islands it controls in the South China Sea, where it has a series of overlapping territorial claims with its neighbours. The rising tensions in the region are fuelling demand for advanced radars, sensors and other equipment known in defence jargon as \"ISR\" - intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\n\"People don't trust their neighbours, resource and territory claims require a keen knowledge of what the other guy is going, and military operations other than war demand strong situational awareness,\" said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at Teal Group, a U.S.-based aerospace consultancy. \"And of course, societies, militaries and non-state armed groups are electronically more noisy than ever, meaning countries need ISR to keep tabs on them.\"\n\nManufacturers displaying their wares in Singapore included traditional players such as Airbus and Boeing, alongside newcomers from Indonesia and Japan. Sweden's Saab unveiled its \"Swordfish\" maritime patrol and anti-submarine system, which can be based on a Bombardier business jet or a turboprop aircraft, at the show.\n\nLean defence budgets, however, mean that many countries are after a lower-cost option.\n\nBoeing offers a stripped-down version of its P-8 Poseidon - the most advanced marine spy plane on the market - called the Maritime Surveillance Aircraft, which is based on a Bombardier business jet.\n\nPT Dirgantara Indonesia, the country's state-owned aerospace firm, offers a maritime patrol version of the Casa CN235 military aircraft that is produces under license from Airbus.\n\nSeveral are in service with the Indonesian navy, which is expected to acquire more, and talks have been held with Malaysia and other countries in the region.\n\nThe company is working with French firm Thales to provide maritime surveillance and anti-submarine capabilities, but it is open to customization. \"We are not selling any of the equipment,\" said Ade Yuyu Wahuna, vice-president of business development and marketing at the company. \"We are the integrators and if anyone wants to choose their own kit, we can integrate that onto the aircraft,\" said Ade Yuyu Wahuna, vice-president of business development and marketing at the company.", "WARTON, England, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- BAE Systems began its final assembly for the first Eurofighter Typhoon to be delivered to the Royal Air Force of Oman.\n\nThe assembly will begin with integrating the fuselage, wings and undercarriage using special automated alignment facilities.

Other sellers included some angel and minority investors. There was no fresh issue of shares, and therefore no infusion of funds into the company. TOI was the first to report the imminent deal in its edition on December 24 last year.\n\n\"The three partners will play a strategic role in helping us accomplish our vision of becoming a $1-billion company by 2020. They have billions of dollars invested in many companies around the world, so they have plenty of contacts among our potential customers and they have strategy insights,\" said Rajendra Kumar Shreemal, CFO of Quest.\n\nQuest, which counts Rolls-Royce, GE, Pratt & Whitney and Airbus among its clients, expects to close 2015-16 with $385 million in revenue, up from $300 million last year. Shreemal said that since 2000, the company has grown at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 30%. He said it is profitable, with an operating profit margin of 20%.\n\nShreemal said the latest fund infusion values the company at over $1 billion.\n\nPawan Singh, managing director of Bain Capital Private Equity, said Quest has demonstrated the ability to scale accounts in a fragmented industry by becoming the core engineering partner to most of the top global firms in its target industries.\n\nQuest was founded by Ajit Prabhu and Aravind Melligere in 1997, and has since consolidated its position in one of the fastest growing areas in the IT services space. The company employs 7,300 people, across 31 centres globally.", "Bombardier Inc. is in talks with more potential buyers including United Airlines Inc. after winning a lifeline $3.8-billion (U.S.) order for its struggling C Series jet from Air Canada, its sales chief said on Thursday.\n\nVisibly relieved after landing the first tentative C Series order in 16 months, and the first from a major carrier since 2011, Bombardier basked in attention at the Singapore Airshow as larger rivals drifted home with a handful of orders.\n\nBombardier announced the 45-aircraft order in Montreal on Wednesday, sending its shares up as much as 30 per cent and overshadowing plans to cut 7,000 jobs.\n\n\"The competition has been fierce but the fact is, C Series is a reality,\" said Colin Bole, senior vice-president for sales and asset management at Bombardier Commercial Aircraft.\n\n\"It can no longer be dismissed as an orphan aircraft [as] we have heard from our competitors. It is there, it has customers and customers will draw customers,\" he said in interview.\n\nOnce finalized, the deal will leave Bombardier 12 planes short of its target of 300 firm orders by the time the delayed C Series enters service, due in the second quarter. That goal has long appeared elusive as Bombardier faced delays, technical problems and nervous buyers.\n\nIt said it remains in talks with United after losing a recent contest there to U.S. plane maker Boeing Co., Mr. Bole said.\n\nIt is talking to other major U.S. carriers and has its sights on another win before the Farnborough Airshow in July. \"I certainly hope so ... it is the goal,\" Mr. Bole said, asked about getting a new deal by the U.K. show, adding \"we have a number of transactions close to finalization.\"\n\nMr. Bole said it was too early to say how the Air Canada deal would be financed but dismissed suggestions by some analysts that it marked hidden support from the Canadian government. \"There is no government subsidy or funding whatsoever. It is a perfectly normal commercial deal,\" he said.\n\n\"I can assure you Air Canada is no slam-dunk customer.\"\n\nBombardier's home win follows a tough four-way competition against European giant Airbus Group SE, Boeing and Brazil's Embraer SA, each of which have aircraft in Air Canada's portfolio.\n\nIt reflects a planned assault by a team of former leasing executives brought in by Bombardier to reinvigorate marketing.\n\n\"It has been tough. We were always confident, but it was a matter of getting out of the starting blocks and I think this is exactly it,\" Mr. Bole said.\n\nAlthough announced elsewhere, it effectively made Bombardier the clear winner at the Singapore show, but analysts said it would not remove challenges for a plane which has struggled to break into the main jet market dominated by bigger players.\n\nThe 110- to 130-seat C Series sits between the 106-seat Embraer 195 and the main 150- to 160-seat models of Airbus and Boeing.\n\nCritics say the C Series is undersized but Bombardier says it is addressing a gap in the market deliberately played down by Airbus and Boeing, which make better margins as airlines trade up.\n\n\"Airbus and Boeing have been pretty successful in brainwashing airlines to think they need larger aircraft,\" Mr. Bole said.\n\nWhile insisting jet markets remain robust, he said Bombardier could benefit from any downturn because it would encourage airlines to buy less risky, smaller models.\n\nBut Airbus and Boeing say the market has voted in favour of their upgraded narrowbody models, selling in the thousands.\n\nBole said the C Series was not suffering engine problems seen on the Airbus A320neo, even though they share similar engines from Pratt & Whitney. Criticism of Pratt & Whitney from Qatar Airways dominated the Singapore Airshow, but the engine maker said current teething problems were being resolved.", "An Air India plane is seen in the background of slums adjoining the international airport in Mumbai\n\nLightson Ngashangva still remembers the long train journeys followed by interminable bus rides each summer when he went home from New Delhi to his village in India's remote northeast.\n\nNow, when the 26-year-old biotechnology student visits his home in Manipur state, his nearly three-day long journey by train and bus has been reduced to a four-hour flight.\n\nA fast-growing economy and an expanding middle class have made India the world's fastest growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations almost every week.\n\nAnd yet, Indian airlines are in distress. Experts say the explosion in air travel of the past decade has happened despite major hurdles in the form of high jet fuel prices, lack of aircraft maintenance infrastructure, choked airports working beyond their capacities and fierce fare wars that have many carriers in the red.\n\nAlthough the problems appear huge, the size and potential of the Indian market continues to draw new players and several foreign airlines have also entered the market. Out of a 1.2 billion population, only about 70 million Indians fly on domestic routes in a year, just a quarter of the size of air travel in China which has a similar population.\n\nAir travel in India is \"showing double digit growth and will continue to grow at double digits for the next 10 to 15 years,\" said Kapil Kaul, regional head of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.\n\nIndigo, India's biggest and most profitable airline, ordered 250 new A320neo aircraft from Airbus in August in a whopping USD26.6 billion deal. At the Dubai Airshow in November, U.S. plane maker Boeing announced that Jet Airways had agreed to an $8 billion deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 aircraft. Jet Airways, part owned by Etihad Airways, will start taking delivery of the planes from mid-2018.\n\nThe purchases are in line with Boeing's forecast released in August that it expects demand for 1,740 planes in India over the next 20 years, at an estimated price of $240 billion. Most of these planes will be for fleet expansion and the rest to replace older aircraft.\n\nThe industry's rapid growth is helping the millions of Indians who need to travel long distances to their country's far northeast or deep south. Budget airline Indigo was the first private carrier to fly to the northeast, starting flights in 2006 to an area that was otherwise an epic train and bus journey.\n\n\"More and more airlines have started flights to my home town. Also, the competition between airlines means tickets are getting cheaper,\" said Ngashangva.\n\nAviation experts say that in the past, socialist-leaning politicians viewed traveling by plane as a luxury and not as an enabler of business and economic growth. The luxury tag ensured punitive taxes on jet fuel, making it nearly 60 percent more expensive than in Singapore or Dubai, both home to busy international airports.\n\nDespite such hurdles, India is forecast to become the third largest aviation market by 2020. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.\n\nIn an attempt to minimize the industry's growing pains, the government in October announced a draft aviation policy. It proposes the development of no-frills airports at more than 400 airstrips across the country. Some of the airstrips date back to British colonial days and have fallen into disuse and disrepair. The government announced it would spend up to 500 million rupees ($7.6 million) on each site to make it useable as an airport.\n\nSome problems remain, however. Aviation experts say the policy remains unclear on an existing condition imposed on airlines in India known as the \"5/20 rule\" where the government does not allow new airlines to fly internationally until they have completed five years of operation and have at least 20 aircraft.\n\nThe draft policy's silence on the future of the country's much-subsidized national carrier, Air India, has also been disappointing, aviation experts said.\n\n\"The government's ownership of the national carrier negatively influences policy decisions and has cost the Indian tax payer $3 billion in recent years,\" said Kaul, the aviation analyst. \"Air India needs to be privatized, or at least be prepared for privatization.\"\n\nAs Indian airlines expand their operations, linking more second tier cities, another major problem facing them is the severe shortage of experienced pilots and technicians. As newer airlines entered the business, the hiring standards for pilots, including their hours of flying experience before taking command of an aircraft, were weakened.\n\nHigh demand for pilots with adequate flying hours has led to corrupt practices. A few years ago, civil aviation authorities detected fake pilot licenses, an unlicensed 'flying school' supplying certificates and touts who helped unqualified candidates obtain licenses for a price.\n\nA government crackdown on those issuing fake certificates and tighter scrutiny of airlines' hiring practices has curbed the problem. But the shortage of pilots persists. Last week, more than 250 passengers of a Jet Airways flight to Toronto were stranded for about nine hours as no pilot was available after a technical fault held up the flight.\n\nThe shortage of pilots has also given them enormous power, leading to lack of discipline when it comes to flight schedules. Pilot unions often fight efforts by budget-strapped airlines to get them to work longer hours.\n\nBut even with its litany of possible pitfalls, flying is the compelling choice compared with lengthy ground travel.\n\n\"Above all, it's the time saved,\" said Lisa James, an interior decorator who hails from the southernmost state of Kerala.\n\nHer twice-annual trips home by train from New Delhi would take her nearly two days each way. \"It was exhausting, apart from the two days that went in travel,\" said James. \"Now that my business is picking up, I can't afford to spend time traveling. Flying just saves me so much time.

This was only a simulation, but if the unmanned drone had been a security risk they could have forced it down -- even though the airwaves were choked by thousands of smartphones and Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\n\"It's like being at a rock concert and trying to listen to someone at the other end of the stadium,\" said Randy Villahermosa, principal director of the research and program development office of Aerospace Corp., which made the detection device. \"It certainly did look feasible to us.\"\n\nIn the past year, drones have flown onto the White House lawn, impeded more than a dozen flights battling California wildfires and been spotted hundreds of times by pilots of traditional aircraft, including airliners holding more than 100 people. That has left law enforcement agencies, prisons and private companies desperate for some way to protect against the new airborne threat.\n\nIn the simulated drone attack on Jan. 1 in Pasadena, California, during one of college football's premier contests, the aircraft was carted around the stadium on a golf cart to avoid violating U.S. regulations barring drone flights near sporting events. But it's part of a tidal wave of efforts to counter the growing threat from the sale of millions of remote- controlled flying devices around the world.\n\n\"It is one of the top, if not the top, safety issues facing airports around the country,\" said Christopher Oswald, vice president for safety and regulatory affairs at the Airports Council International-North America trade group.\n\nScores of companies, from a division of aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus Group SE to tiny startups, are jumping into the anti-drone market. The products range from military-grade radars and lasers, to a company training eagles to snatch small drones out of the sky for Dutch police.\n\nSome companies have developed nets that one drone can drape over another to take them down.\n\n\"It is a hugely growing space and the traditional defense contractors will make some money selling these,\" Jim Williams, the former chief of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's drone division who is now at the law firm Dentons US LLP, said.\n\n\"There definitely is potential,\" Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the aerospace researcher Teal Group Corp., said about the burgeoning drone-detection market.\n\nBefore these companies can take off, however, they must first maneuver through a thicket of legal, ethical and technical questions, according to Williams, Finnegan and Oswald.\n\nBattelle, the world's largest nonprofit research organization, learned that the hard way. Last year, it introduced its DroneDefender, a gun-like device resembling a prop from a \"Flash Gordon\" movie that blasts a radio beam at an unmanned device to jam its radio control signals. But it was forced to withdraw the product because using it violates U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulations.\n\n\"We have had to go quiet on it while the FCC figures out how it's going to regulate this sort of thing,\" Katy Delaney, a spokeswoman for Battelle, said.\n\nFCC, which governs the nation's airwaves, prohibits the use of devices that interfere with radio transmissions, including those that control drones. It is also against the law to sell such devices to unauthorized consumers in the U.S., agency spokesman Neil Grace said.\n\nU.S. criminal law separately prohibits use of any \"destructive device\" to cripple an aircraft. While airport operators are anxious for tools to monitor drones that threaten aircraft, they are wary of the potential legal issues, Oswald said.\n\n\"There are some big open questions and gray lines,\" he said.\n\nAfter drone-related safety incidents and sightings rose from only a handful to more than 100 per month last year, the FAA announced it was working with CACI International Inc. to test the company's drone monitor system, known as SkyTracker. It is based on technology that the CACI, which provides computer services to intelligence and defense agencies, has already developed, Mike Kushin, an executive vice president, said.\n\nCACI's system can not only monitor drones near sensitive sites, such as the U.S. Capitol, it can also home in on the person flying the device by monitoring radio signals, giving police the ability to locate the perpetrator. In some cases, it may even be possible to get identifying information such as a device's serial number, Kushin said.\n\n\"You turn on the drone, you turn on the handset and there is a sync-up between them,\" he said. \"We usually detect that even before the drone takes off.\"\n\nThe company believes it can defeat drone operators who encrypt radio signals and it works on small drone models made by all the main manufacturers, he said. Like the Aerospace device used at the Rose Bowl, CACI's version can take over a drone's controls. The company will only offer that portion of the product if a client is legally permitted to use it, Kushin said.\n\nA task force of government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, is participating in tests of the CACI equipment, according to Amanda DeGroff, an agency spokeswoman.\n\nAirbus Defence & Space GmbH uses different technology to detect drones. Drawing from military technology, its radar can identify a small unmanned aircraft as far as 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) away, according to Meinrad Edel, director of sales, protection and reconnaissance at the company's Ulm, Germany, facility. Video cameras take over at closer range and can see a drone as small as the popular SZ DJI Technology Co. Ltd. Phantom from .9 miles (1.5 kilometers), Edel said.\n\nThe company offers counter measures that can divert or take down the drone, if it's legal to use such jamming technology, he said.\n\nIn the Rose Bowl test, the team from Aerospace, a nonprofit that does high-tech research for the government, was able to tease out the drone's signals from airwaves around the stadium that were clogged by tens of thousands of smartphones, Wi-Fi networks and radio transmitters.\n\nIn a follow up last month, Aerospace's engineers demonstrated it was possible to take over control of one drone without interfering with the radio signals of another nearby unmanned aircraft, Villahermosa said.\n\nWhile the company won't be selling anti-drone products, it is working with law enforcement agencies to find out whether the technology would work in real-world situations, he said.\n\nAerospace's scientists have looked at various techniques for detecting drones and none of them are perfect, he said. Sensing radio signals will probably work for drone operators who accidentally fly into the wrong places, but may not be as effective against a sophisticated operator intentionally trying to evade detection. Protecting sites as sensitive as the White House may require multiple layers of technology, he said.\n\nThe problem is similar to creating anti-virus protections for a computer, he said. There will be an unending race between nefarious actors and those creating the defenses.\n\n\"There won't be one magic solution or a Band-Aid that we can put on this to solve the drone-threat problem,\" Villahermosa said. \"It's going to evolve over time.\"", "TOULOUSE, France, Feb. 18 (UPI) -- Airbus Defense and Space has received an order from Britain's Ministry of Defense for its solar-powered Zephyr 8 unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\nThe Zephyr 8, described by Airbus as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite craft that provides persistent surveillance and communications links for about a month at a time before it needs to land for refurbishment.\n\nIts altitude ceiling is about 65,000 feet.

Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022 and to 500 million by 2027.\n\nIn an attempt to minimize the industry's growing pains, the government in October last year announced a draft aviation policy. It proposes the development of no-frills airports at more than 400 airstrips across the country. Some of the airstrips date back to British colonial days and have fallen into disuse and disrepair. The government announced it would spend up to 500 million rupees (US$7.6 million) on each site to make it useable as an airport.", "If Air Canada takes 45 Bombardier C Series aircraft, as it signaled on Feb. 17 that it would, the carrier plans to use the first 25 to replace its Embraer 190 fleet, with the rest going toward fulfilling incremental growth, executives said on the carrier's fourth-quarter earnings conference call.\n\nAir Canada, which signed a letter of intent with Bombardier, expects to take one aircraft in 2019 and the rest between 2020 and 2022. Though its deal calls for the airline to add CS300 jets, Air Canada has the right to substitute the smaller CS100. Air Canada also retains options for 30 more aircraft. The airline is estimating fuel burn and maintenance savings will be greater than 15% per seat, compared to expenses with the E190s being replaced.\n\nCEO Calin Rovinescu noted that the CS300 order \"complements\" Air Canada's existing order for 61 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The 737s are mostly intended to replace approximately 75 Airbus narrowbodies. Rovinescu declined to say where the CS300s would be used, but suggested they would be deployed at all three of the airline's major hubs: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.\n\n\"We are happy with our MAX order, but we think that the MAX airplane performs better at the higher end of the size range,\" Rovinescu said. \"The C-Series . . . is much more compelling at the lower end of the size range, so it gives us that added benefit.\"\n\nAir Canada said in a statement that the deal is contingent on \"completion of final documentation and satisfaction of certain other closing conditions precedent.\" Asked if the Canadian government put pressure on Air Canada to support Bombardier, Rovinescu said it did not.\n\nIn other matters, Air Canada pointed out it is more insulated from economic problems in Canada's oil-producing provinces than WestJet Airlines, which recently told analysts that roughly 40% of its capacity touches Alberta, Canada's energy hub province. While WestJet has been forced to slash capacity in Western Canada and even deferred deliveries of some Boeing aircraft, Air Canada is seeing fewer effects, though it is reporting some revenue softness in the Alberta cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Fort McMurray.\n\n\"With domestic revenue accounting for only one-third, we are better immunized from weaknesses in Canada than ever before, including in Alberta,\" Rovinescu explained.\n\nAir Canada also is seeing some softness on leisure-focused routes between Canada and Florida, Arizona, Las Vegas and Hawaii, but it is making up for it by adding to its slice of inbound tourists from Asia and Europe, executives said. The airline said it would continue to focus abroad, saying roughly 90% of its capacity increases this year will come in international markets. Sixth-freedom traffic will rise \"significantly\" this year, Rovinescu said.\n\nStill, he added that the Canadian market is performing fine. \"Canada is not as toxic as the media would have you believe.\" In the fourth quarter, Air Canada reported adjusted net income of C$116 million (U.S.$84.6 million) on operating revenues of C$3.18 billion. During the period, passenger revenue per available seat mile decreased 5.3%, while yields fell 5.5%. The airline's operating margin was 5%, up from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nAir Canada blamed its yield decrease on several factors, including an increased average stage length, more lower yielding international connecting passengers and more capacity flown by Rouge, the airline's leisure-focused subsidiary.", "New Delhi * Lightson Ngashangva still remembers the long train journeys followed by interminable bus rides each summer when he went home from New Delhi to his village in India's remote northeast.\n\nNow, when the 26-year-old biotechnology student visits his home in Manipur state, his nearly three-day long journey by train and bus has been reduced to a four-hour flight.\n\nA fast-growing economy and an expanding middle class have made India the world's fastest growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations almost every week.\n\nAnd yet, Indian airlines are in distress. Experts say the explosion in air travel of the past decade has happened despite major hurdles in the form of high jet fuel prices, lack of aircraft maintenance infrastructure, choked airports working beyond their capacities and fierce fare wars that have many carriers in the red.\n\nAlthough the problems appear huge, the size and potential of the Indian market continues to draw new players and several foreign airlines have also entered the market. Out of a 1.2 billion population, only about 70 million Indians fly on domestic routes in a year, just a quarter of the size of air travel in China which has a similar population.\n\nAir travel in India is \"showing double digit growth and will continue to grow at double digits for the next 10 to 15 years,\" said Kapil Kaul, regional head of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.\n\nIndigo, India's biggest and most profitable airline, ordered 250 new A320neo aircraft from Airbus in August in a whopping $26.6 billion deal. At the Dubai Airshow in November, U.S. plane maker Boeing announced that Jet Airways had agreed to an $8 billion deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 aircraft. Jet Airways, part owned by Etihad Airways, will start taking delivery of the planes from mid-2018.\n\nThe purchases are in line with Boeing's forecast released in August that it expects demand for 1,740 planes in India over the next 20 years, at an estimated price of $240 billion. Most of these planes will be for fleet expansion and the rest to replace older aircraft.\n\nThe industry's rapid growth is helping the millions of Indians who need to travel long distances to their country's far northeast or deep south. Budget airline Indigo was the first private carrier to fly to the northeast, starting flights in 2006 to an area that was otherwise an epic train and bus journey.\n\n\"More and more airlines have started flights to my home town. Also, the competition between airlines means tickets are getting cheaper,\" said Ngashangva.\n\nAviation experts say that in the past, socialist-leaning politicians viewed traveling by plane as a luxury and not as an enabler of business and economic growth. The luxury tag ensured punitive taxes on jet fuel, making it nearly 60 percent more expensive than in Singapore or Dubai, both home to busy international airports.\n\nDespite such hurdles, India is forecast to become the third largest aviation market by 2020.

The government announced it would spend up to 500 million rupees ($7.6 million) on each site to make it useable as an airport.\n\nSome problems remain, however. Aviation experts say the policy remains unclear on an existing condition imposed on airlines in India known as the \"5/20 rule\" where the government does not allow new airlines to fly internationally until they have completed five years of operation and have at least 20 aircraft.\n\nThe draft policy's silence on the future of the country's much-subsidized national carrier, Air India, has also been disappointing, aviation experts said.\n\n\"The government's ownership of the national carrier negatively influences policy decisions and has cost the Indian tax payer $3 billion in recent years,\" said Kaul, the aviation analyst. \"Air India needs to be privatized, or at least be prepared for privatization.\"\n\nAs Indian airlines expand their operations, linking more second tier cities, another major problem facing them is the severe shortage of experienced pilots and technicians. As newer airlines entered the business, the hiring standards for pilots, including their hours of flying experience before taking command of an aircraft, were weakened.\n\nHigh demand for pilots with adequate flying hours has led to corrupt practices. A few years ago, civil aviation authorities detected fake pilot licenses, an unlicensed 'flying school' supplying certificates and touts who helped unqualified candidates obtain licenses for a price.", "If you're in the air transport business, let's together make that our business also - at least in this column, appropriately titled 'YOUR BUSINESS IS OUR BUSINESS!' This piece was prompted by four historic and historical subjects-matter...\n\nOne: it was on a date like today's - Feb. 18, 1911 - that the first official flight transporting mail was in India 105 years ago, when Pilot Henri Pequet (23) delivered 6,500 letters on an aircraft from Allahabad to Naini, 10km away - thus making history in airmail transport!\n\nTwo: It was on a date like today's, Feb. 18, 1930, that a cow named 'Elm Farm Ollie' (alias 'Nellie Jay,' 'Sunnymede Ollie' and 'Sky Queen') became the first cow to be flown - and milked - on a fixed-wing aircraft. This was during an International Air Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.\n\nIf you don't believe the foregoing, would you believe that it's also on a date like today's 37 years ago - Feb. 18, 1979 - that snow fell in the Sahara Desert in southern Algeria... The only time that's happened in recorded History!\n\nSo much for the histrionics then... Sorry; I mean 'historic events!'Let's move on to this 2016th Year of our Lord for the fourth event...Tanzania's unorthodox, independent-minded (read 'maverick') President\n\nJohn Magufuli pledged on Feb. 4 to provide Tsh750bn for the national air-carrier, Air-Tanzania Co. Ltd (ATCL), to purchase six 'Airbus' aircraft (carrying capacity: 100-120 passengers) at US$90.6m apiece (Tsh193.8bn)!\n\nThe President's pledge is predicated upon two 'conditionalities' (World Bank pardon) - both tall orders in My Book of Things! One: ATCL's 200+ workers must go with the Winds of Change! Two: the\n\nJudiciary must expedite adjudication on 442 cases whose completion would generate Tsh1tr in govt revenues... Holy Moses! To fulminate the Judiciary into explosive action, Magufuli pledged\n\nTsh12.5bn up-front - and lived up to this by having the Treasury disburse that sum on Feb. 8, two working-days post-the pledge!\n\nCould the President also live up-to his pledge for a further Tsh250bn to the Judiciary - and a whopping Tsh750bn to ATCL? Could he? I ask you!\n\nI don't know... But, to recoup a trillion smackers from 442 cases - some of which've been hanging fire in the courts for years - would mean 'convicting' all the accused, etc, etc, some of whom may be bankrupted by now...!\n\nIt's a gargantuan task fraught with a myriad repercussions, positive and negative... This means the national air-carrier could grope its way back into thriving business - or continue wallowing in the nonviable commercial netherworld!\n\nThe fourth matter the subject of this piece is about 'high taxes and State meddling hurting the airline business in Africa.' That's the study findings of the African Airlines Association, a body whose mission is 'to serve African airlines, promote and protect their common interests... '\n\nAccording to the Association's Chief Executive, Elijah Chingosho, most African air-carriers 'are struggling with inordinately-high govt taxes levied on the aviation industry, and uncompetitive policies ...' adopting protectionist measures ostensibly to safeguard state-owned carriers - with a number of them receiving bails-out from state coffers! [AFKInsider: Feb. 2, 2016].\n\nNoting that only a very few of the 16 state-owned airlines in Africa made a profit in 2014/15 - including Ethiopian Airlines - Chingosho cited Kenya Airways (KQ) and South African Airways (SAA) as making huge losses in the last three years - and are on govt bailout lifelines!\n\n'Kenya Airways received a $42m capital injection from the govt last year after it made a $289m loss in 2014... [ ].\n\nSAA received US$105m in govt-backed loans to help it weather turbulent times...' [ ].\n\nIn that regard, one interested party came out with food for thought! Ed Winters - Chief Executive of 'FastJet, one of Africa's fasted-growing private-owned low-cost airlines' - wonders why African governments direct good money at 'loss-making national airlines when that money could be far better spent on roads, health... All those things which the people badly-need!' [ ].\n\nTherein lies the crux of the matter - to tax or not to tax; to bail out or not. That's the good, the bad, the ugly and the historic in the air transport business... Cheers!

The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations almost every week.\n\nAnd yet, Indian airlines are in distress. Experts say the explosion in air travel of the past decade has happened despite major hurdles in the form of high jet fuel prices, lack of aircraft maintenance infrastructure, choked airports working beyond their capacities and fierce fare wars that have many carriers in the red.\n\nAlthough the problems appear huge, the size and potential of the Indian market continues to draw new players and several foreign airlines have also entered the market. Out of a 1.2 billion population, only about 70 million Indians fly on domestic routes in a year, just a quarter of the size of air travel in China which has a similar population.\n\nAir travel in India is \"showing double digit growth and will continue to grow at double digits for the next 10 to 15 years,\" said Kapil Kaul, regional head of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.\n\nIndigo, India's biggest and most profitable airline, ordered 250 new A320neo aircraft from Airbus in August in a whopping $26.6 billion deal. At the Dubai Airshow in November, U.S. plane maker Boeing announced that Jet Airways had agreed to an $8 billion deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 aircraft. Jet Airways, part owned by Etihad Airways, will start taking delivery of the planes from mid-2018.\n\nThe purchases are in line with Boeing's forecast released in August that it expects demand for 1,740 planes in India over the next 20 years, at an estimated price of $240 billion. Most of these planes will be for fleet expansion and the rest to replace older aircraft.\n\nThe industry's rapid growth is helping the millions of Indians who need to travel long distances to their country's far northeast or deep south. Budget airline Indigo was the first private carrier to fly to the northeast, starting flights in 2006 to an area that was otherwise an epic train and bus journey.\n\n\"More and more airlines have started flights to my home town. Also, the competition between airlines means tickets are getting cheaper,\" said Ngashangva.\n\nAviation experts say that in the past, socialist-leaning politicians viewed traveling by plane as a luxury and not as an enabler of business and economic growth. The luxury tag ensured punitive taxes on jet fuel, making it nearly 60 percent more expensive than in Singapore or Dubai, both home to busy international airports.\n\nFILE - In this May 25, 2010, file photo, an Air India plane is seen in the background of slums adjoining the the international airport in Mumbai, India.

Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027.\n\nIn an attempt to minimize the industry's growing pains, the government in October announced a draft aviation policy. It proposes the development of no-frills airports at more than 400 airstrips across the country. Some of the airstrips date back to British colonial days and have fallen into disuse and disrepair. The government announced it would spend up to 500 million rupees ($7.6 million) on each site to make it useable as an airport.\n\nSome problems remain, however. Aviation experts say the policy remains unclear on an existing condition imposed on airlines in India known as the \"5/20 rule\" where the government does not allow new airlines to fly internationally until they have completed five years of operation and have at least 20 aircraft.\n\nThe draft policy's silence on the future of the country's much-subsidized national carrier, Air India, has also been disappointing, aviation experts said.\n\n\"The government's ownership of the national carrier negatively influences policy decisions and has cost the Indian tax payer $3 billion in recent years,\" said Kaul, the aviation analyst. \"Air India needs to be privatized, or at least be prepared for privatization.\"\n\nAs Indian airlines expand their operations, linking more second tier cities, another major problem facing them is the severe shortage of experienced pilots and technicians. As newer airlines entered the business, the hiring standards for pilots, including their hours of flying experience before taking command of an aircraft, were weakened.\n\nHigh demand for pilots with adequate flying hours has led to corrupt practices. A few years ago, civil aviation authorities detected fake pilot licenses, an unlicensed 'flying school' supplying certificates and touts who helped unqualified candidates obtain licenses for a price.\n\nA government crackdown on those issuing fake certificates and tighter scrutiny of airlines' hiring practices has curbed the problem. But the shortage of pilots persists. Last week, more than 250 passengers of a Jet Airways flight to Toronto were stranded for about nine hours as no pilot was available after a technical fault held up the flight.\n\nThe shortage of pilots has also given them enormous power, leading to lack of discipline when it comes to flight schedules. Pilot unions often fight efforts by budget-strapped airlines to get them to work longer hours.\n\nBut even with its litany of possible pitfalls, flying is the compelling choice compared with lengthy ground travel.\n\n\"Above all, it's the time saved,\" said Lisa James, an interior decorator who hails from the southernmost state of Kerala.\n\nHer twice-annual trips home by train from New Delhi would take her nearly two days each way. \"It was exhausting, apart from the two days that went in travel,\" said James. \"Now that my business is picking up, I can't afford to spend time traveling. Flying just saves me so much time. And money.\"", "MONTREAL -- Continued government support for global firms such as Bombardier Inc. is critical if Canada wants to diversify its economy beyond natural resources, say two business experts.\n\nBombardier (TSX:BBD.B) announced Wednesday it's cutting 7,000 jobs over two years, including roughly 3,000 in Canada, months after the Quebec government pledged US$1 billion of public money for the firm.\n\nThe federal Liberals say they are studying Bombardier's request for more funding, which reports say is also $1 billion.\n\nProf. Tyler Adam Chamberlin of the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management says more government cash for Bombardier is essential because the country doesn't have many firms like it.\n\nCanada's giant telecoms don't compete internationally and the country's big banks are insulated from foreign competition, he said.\n\n\"When you really dig into it and ask how many companies in Canada are really engaged in global, competitive industries, the number dwindles quickly,\" Chamberlin said.\n\nBombardier employs more than 70,000 people around the world and exports roughly 95 per cent of its products.\n\n\"There is no one at the size of a truly global competitor with a global footprint as Bombardier,\" said Karl Moore, professor at the Desautels faculty of management at McGill University.\n\nChamberlin said Bombardier's competitors such as Boeing in the United States and the European-based Airbus receive state support that \"dwarfs\" Canada's subsidies.\n\n\"This is the nature of the industry,\" Chamberlin said. \"We have to be prepared to ask ourselves that if we really want to be in this industry, this is what we have to do.\"\n\nChamberlin added that if Canada wants to get out of the boom-and-bust cycle of oil and to have an economy that relies less on extracting resources from the ground, supporting global industries such as Bombardier is essential.\n\nIn Quebec City, Premier Premier Philippe Couillard defended his government's decision to inject the money into Bombardier's CSeries commercial aircraft unit without taking an ownership percentage in the company's rail sector.\n\nCouillard said the move was the right one as 3,200 of the job cuts are set for the rail department with none planned on the CSeries side.

Wolfsburg still took an away victory, 3-2, while Madrid did the same by a 2-0 score.\n\nGent nearly conceded just seconds into its match, and Julian Draxler scored on either side of halftime before Max Kruse seemed to finish the series prematurely on the hour mark. However, the character of Gent wouldn't allow it to lose without a massive fight, and Sven Kums and Kalifa Coulibaly scored in the 80th and 89th minutes, respectively, to keep the series within a goal.\n\nPlanet Futbol Champions League: Late goals give PSG, Benfica first-leg wins by Ben Lyttleton 0 0 0 0 0 0 More In Rome, a nail-biting first half finished without either side getting a clear chance on goal.

The way he turned a defender on the flank and calmly finished his first, then picked off a stray pass and chipped his finish over the goalkeeper for the second looked smooth and effortless.\n\nVieirinha's assist on the first goal was equally as sublime, his run angled slightly wide to draw two defenders and open space in the center for Draxler to cut into and receive the return pass. That kind of awareness and execution is what made Draxler and Germany a world champion in 2014.\n\nHT: Gent 0, Wolfsburg 1. Julian Draxler bags his second #UCL goal of the season with a cool finish. #UCLonFOX https://t.co/KvAeD7f6Bw -- FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer)\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\n\nRoma's attacking midfield workhorse Radja Nainggolan deserves an honorable mention here. His defensive work, supporting Roma's forward press from the second line of defense, ensured Madrid couldn't find any meaningful possession in midfield. He also broke forward into the attack as Roma countered, though he couldn't help his team find an end product.\n\nMoment of the Day: Ronaldo nets his away goal\n\nIt's been replayed enough times over the past day or so, so it's hardly worth recapping Ronaldo's reaction in the pre-match press conference to a question of why he hadn't scored on the road since Nov. 29, 2015. After some verbal sparring, he grabbed his jacket off the chair next to him and walked out purposefully, a gleam in his eyes suggesting he would rather let his actions do the talking.\n\nFor most of the first hour against Roma, Ronaldo's game could be described as frustrating. Starved of service, he was booed mercilessly by the home fans anytime the ball came near him. The boos abated, though, after his goal in the 57th minute.\n\nWATCH: Messi scores pair of landmark goals for Barcelona\n\nMarcelo played him behind on the left wing, and Ronaldo cut inside past Roma right back Alessandro Florenzi to get into a shooting position.

It's hard to beat Ronaldo silencing the critics with one swing of his right leg, though.\n\nMajor Takeaway of the Day: Zidane's midfield isn't working properly\n\nFrom the start, it was quickly apparent that the problems with Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane's team structure that have barely cost it yet in league play would be an issue against Roma. Once again, Luka Modri\u0107 and Toni Kroos stayed low, almost on top of the center backs, and stifled the build-up play.\n\nPlanet Futbol Real Madrid midfield structure a focus of manager Zinedine Zidane's tactics by Liviu Bird 0 0 0 0 0 0 More Coupled with Roma's excellent forward press from its front three and Nainggolan supporting from the second defensive line, Madrid was reduced to largely meaningless possession. Real kept the majority of the ball, but it couldn't break the first line of pressure despite the numerical superiority because of Roma's positional superiority -- an important distinction in the effectiveness of any team's spacing in possession.\n\nThe resulting ball circulation was largely in a \"U\" shape, from wing to wing through the center but never threatening to get into the dangerous central spaces. Neither team managed a shot on target in the first half, Madrid because it couldn't access those spaces and Roma because it played largely on the counterattack, although Madrid got five on target to lead the category, 5-1, at full time.\n\nOf course, Ronaldo's goal didn't need access to the central area in the build-up, and he created what little he needed with his one-on-one ability. Similar could be said of Jes\u00e9, who drove into the right-side half-space on the dribble before finishing powerfully. Still, against the type of teams that Madrid will face in the quarterfinals, semifinals and final -- the likes of Bayern Munich and Barcelona specifically -- the midfield could be a real problem area.\n\nHow the Second Legs Shape Up\n\nGent's dream Champions League run looked all but over until the final 10 minutes of its game. Wolfsburg scored three away goals and hardly looked uncomfortable on Wednesday until the 80th minute, its skill from the group stage that saw it eliminate Manchester United carrying over into the knockout round.\n\nHowever, Kums and Coulibaly's late goals changed that story. Gent has proven it can pull off miracles, and surmounting a three-goal deficit would clearly count as another chapter in the story that has been its incredible season. It'll be difficult, though, heading away from home needing a result in Wolfsburg.\n\n* Subscribe to get the best of Sports Illustrated delivered right to your inbox\n\nIn the other series, Real Madrid certainly holds the advantage heading into its home match, especially after scoring two away goals.

An international tournament looming, England's hopes resting substantially on his shoulders and then another of those announcements which we know will consign us to weeks - perhaps months - looking for the signs that Wayne Rooney will be fit in time.\n\nThe only difference between the 2010 World Cup, when an ankle issue plagued him, and his knee injury now is that Louis van Gaal was more transparent about things. Sir Alex Ferguson always considered players' fitness his own business and none of ours.\n\nRead more Van Gaal defensive over sale of Man Utd strikers after Rooney injury\n\n\"You could never say how long he could be out for,\" Van Gaal said in Denmark, which meant the expected six weeks before Rooney is ready to play could extend into May - and the dog days of the season.\n\nThat would certainly mean something consistent with the 2006 metatarsal break which also left him touch-and-go, before the proclamation - to paraphrase a line that was famously uttered at the Germany World Cup finals by a Football Association official and later attributed to Rooney - that \"the big man is back in town\".\n\nAdd the litany of injuries in England tournament years to the ban which excluded him for the first two matches of Euro 2012 - after he was sent off in England's final qualifier in Montenegro - and the pattern looks weirdly consistent. If not Rooney it has been David Beckham, or Gareth Barry who has occupied the nation's hopes and fears when the month of the biennial international cycle comes around.\n\nRead more Rooney left at home at Man Utd fly out to FC Midtjylland\n\nBut though Van Gaal has source for personal angst, given Rooney's seven goals in the last nine games and his substantial part in attempting to bridge the six-point gap between United and fourth-placed Manchester City in the pursuit of a Champions League spot, there are reasons to be philosophical.\n\nUnited can reflect on their lack of options, with Javier Hernandez off scoring freely for Bayer Leverkusen and loanee James Wilson hardly pulling up trees at Brighton & Hove Albion, but the England manager, Roy Hodgson, can at least reflect that his talisman will have had some rest.\n\nThe 2010 ankle injury, sustained early in United's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Bayern Munich, was exacerbated by Ferguson's decision to play Rooney in the second leg. Those present on that spring night at Old Trafford will recall how the manager's team sheet was viewed with incredulity. But the way that year's injury was sustained - Rooney turning his right ankle badly on landing after tracking a run by Mario Gomez - underlined the inconvenient truth about the striker. He is an injury waiting to happen, because of the relentless effort levels he puts in.\n\nRead more Blame us, not Louis van Gaal, says Man Utd captain Rooney\n\nFabio Capello, the England manager at the South Africa World Cup, always told him in no uncertain terms that he must cut out the workhorse routine, spend less time occupying space where his own side's full-back should be, and more in the six-yard box, \"being selfish\", as Rooney put it.\n\nThat's just not the way he plays, though. It was extremely significant that the severity of this injury seems to have stemmed from the player's decision to play on with it at Sunderland, in a team which he carries more than any other we have known at Old Trafford. \"Brave,\" is what Van Gaal called him. \"Foolish,\" Capello and Hodgson would both say.\n\nAt 30, a need to moderate his work rate is greater than ever for a player whose physiology is not ideal for a 90-minute distance run.

Rooney - the United and England captain - has a ligament injury that will repair only with six weeks or so of inactivity.\n\nManchester United captain Wayne Rooney is facing up to two months out with a knee ligament injury\n\nRooney suffered the injury during United's 2-1 loss at Sunderland in the Premier League on February 13\n\nNevertheless, as United prepare to muddle on without him, Hodgson, instead of worrying, should perhaps allow himself to contemplate the rare luxury of having a rested and repaired Rooney at his disposal for Euro 2016 this summer.\n\nOn Wednesday night in Denmark, United manager Louis van Gaal was rather vague about Rooney's injury.\n\n'He has a knee problem so we will have to wait and see,' he said. It is understood, however, that Rooney was hurt during Saturday's defeat at Sunderland and was aggravated because he played on with the problem instead of coming off.\n\nThe 30-year-old has been told he may return by the end of March with a little luck.\n\nThis is dire news for Van Gaal's United. For all his struggles in the first half of the season, Rooney has been the Barclays Premier League's most effective attacking player since the turn of the year with five goals and three assists.\n\nIt has been that upturn in form, along with that of Frenchman Anthony Martial, that has kept United on the fringe of the top four.\n\nUnited boss Louis van Gaal confirmed Rooney's injury woe on Wednesday ahead of their clash at Midyjtlland\n\nVan Gaal is unsure exactly how long Rooney will be out for due to the complexities of a knee problem\n\nAnthony Martial (left) and Memphis Depay are set to lead the attack in Rooney's absence at Midyjtlland\n\nMATCHES ROONEY COULD MISS\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED\n\nFeb 18 - Europa League - Midtjylland (A)\n\nFeb 22 - FA Cup - Shrewsbury (A)\n\nFeb 25 - Europa League - Midtjylland (H)\n\nFeb 28 - Premier League - Arsenal (H)\n\nMar 2 - Premier League - Watford (H)\n\nMar 6 - Premier League - West Brom (A)\n\nMar 12 - Premier League - Crystal Palace (H)\n\nMar 20 - Premier League - Manchester City (A)\n\nApr 2 - Premier League - Everton (H)\n\nApr 9 - Premier League - Tottenham (A)\n\nApr 16 - Premier League - Aston Villa (H)\n\nENGLAND\n\nMar 26 - Friendly - Germany (A)\n\nMar 29 - Friendly - Holland (H)\n\nWithout Rooney, it is tempting to wonder how United will cope. He is not the player he once was but he still occupies defenders and his presence gives Van Gaal's team shape and industry.\n\nVan Gaal is expected to move Martial into a central position against Midtjylland on Thursday and that is where we can expect the 20-year-old to stay. In terms of his football education, this can only help him. It will also be interesting to see how another young United player, the thus-far disappointing but gifted Memphis Depay, responds now that a spate of injuries has compelled Van Gaal to consider him once again.\n\nFor England and Hodgson, however, an enforced spell on the sidelines for Rooney may yet work out favourably - as long as he manages to play himself back into form and sharpness by the time Euro 2016 starts in early June.\n\nThis is the key issue. Rooney is traditionally slow to find rhythm after a lay-off. On this occasion, however, there should really be enough time.\n\nIt looks likely Rooney will miss all United's games between now and the April 2 fixture with Everton, as well as England friendlies against Germany and Holland.\n\nRooney's injury may be a blessing in disguise for England boss Roy Hodgson ahead of Euro 2016\n\nHodgson (left) will be hoping the 30-year-old can inspire England to success at Euro 2016 this summer\n\nThat would leave six Premier League games and possible FA Cup and Europa League ties, as well as pre-tournament England friendlies, in which Rooney can, theoretically at least, find the edge he needs for France.\n\nIf all of this sounds rather calculating then so be it. What is certain is that exactly the same thoughts and estimations will have been running through Rooney's head as he ponders his chances of going into Euro 2016 ready and able to fire.\n\nRooney, as we know, has a chequered history when it comes to injuries and major tournaments. His 2006 World Cup in Germany was ruined by a foot problem.\n\nFour years later he headed to South Africa with an ankle issue, while just before the Brazil World Cup campaign two years ago he had a troubling toe problem.\n\nThe story has become a familiar one but those injuries were suffered later in the year. This time, it seems, Rooney's body has shown somewhat better timing.\n\nWith six weeks to go until the 2006 World Cup, Rooney suffered a broken metatarsal against Chelsea\n\nRooney was selected for the 2006 World Cup but was sent off in England's quarter-final defeat by Portugal\n\nAgainst Bayern Munich in the 2010 Champions League quarter-final, Rooney was struck by an ankle injury\n\nDespite overcoming the injury, Rooney endured a woeful 2010 World Cup as England bowed out at the last 16\n\nHodgson, given the choice, would have preferred to have Rooney with him when England travel to Berlin next month. Without him, however, the England manager may be forced to experiment - and that is no bad thing.\n\nLeicester City's Jamie Vardy surely must play against the Germans, while it would be interesting to see Tottenham's Dele Alli and Everton's Ross Barkley in the same England team.\n\nBy that time, Rooney should have benefited from a sunshine break likely to be granted by Van Gaal and, all being well, he will be approaching the latter stages of his rehabilitation process.\n\nInjuries are unpredictable, of course, and recovery times are fluid. Rooney, though, is about to begin his own version of a winter's break and while that may critically damage the prospects of his club and its manager, for once the reverse may be prove to be true for a country whose need is equally great.", "ROME (AP) - Cristiano Ronaldo ended his away scoring drought with an impressive second-half goal as Real Madrid won 2-0 at Roma on Wednesday in the first leg of the Round of 16 in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory also marked a successful debut for Zinedine Zidane as Madrid's manager in the elite competition, with the 10-time champion taking a big step toward the quarterfinals.\n\n\"Everyone expects (Ronaldo) to score and today he was able to,\" Zidane said. \"I'm happy for these two away goals and that we didn't concede any goals.\"\n\nShortly before the hour mark, Ronaldo collected a pass up the left flank from Marcelo, rapidly cut inside - moving the ball with a deft flick of his legs - and launched a powerful shot that deflected off Roma fullback Alessandro Florenzi.\n\nAfter scoring, Ronaldo ran toward Zidane and hugged the French great, who replaced Rafa Benitez last month.\n\nSubstitute Jese sealed the victory with an angled shot four minutes from the end after Roma failed to take advantage of several opportunities for an equalizer.\n\nAt the final whistle, Zidane congratulated each of his players one by one, including those who didn't play.\n\n\"I do it because the team is the most important thing,\" said Zidane, who scored the winning goal for Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen. \"It's the players who make the difference and today it was Ronaldo - it's often him - but everyone's contribution is important, even those who don't play much.

David Moyes played no part in any negotiation with Barnsley FC concerning the transfer of John Stones, which may explain why he is mistaken as to the fee paid.\"\n\nStones was the last signing that Moyes made at the Merseyside club, before he ended his 11-year-long tenure at Everton to move to Manchester United in May 2013.", "ROME (AP) -- Cristiano Ronaldo ended his away scoring drought with an impressive second-half goal as Real Madrid won 2-0 at Roma on Wednesday in the first leg of the Round of 16 in the Champions League.\n\nThe victory also marked a successful debut for Zinedine Zidane as Madrid's manager in the elite competition, with the 10-time champion taking a big step toward the quarterfinals.\n\n\"Everyone expects (Ronaldo) to score and today he was able to,\" Zidane said. \"I'm happy for these two away goals and that we didn't concede any goals.\"\n\nShortly before the hour mark, Ronaldo collected a pass up the left flank from Marcelo, rapidly cut inside -- moving the ball with a deft flick of his legs -- and launched a powerful shot that deflected off Roma fullback Alessandro Florenzi.\n\nAfter scoring, Ronaldo ran toward Zidane and hugged the French great, who replaced Rafa Benitez last month.\n\nSubstitute Jese sealed the victory with an angled shot four minutes from the end after Roma failed to take advantage of several opportunities for an equalizer.\n\nAt the final whistle, Zidane congratulated each of his players one by one, including those who didn't play.\n\n\"I do it because the team is the most important thing,\" said Zidane, who scored the winning goal for Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final against Bayer Leverkusen. \"It's the players who make the difference and today it was Ronaldo -- it's often him -- but everyone's contribution is important, even those who don't play much. We win all together.\"\n\nIt was Ronaldo's first goal on the road since Nov. 29, when he scored a penalty against Eibar. It was also the 89th career goal in the Champions League for the three-time FIFA world player of the year -- adding to his record haul -- and his 12th this season.\n\nThe return leg is on March 8 in Madrid.\n\nNew Roma coach Luciano Spalletti, who replaced Rudi Garcia last month, wasn't too disappointed with his side's performance.\n\n\"We played a great match,\" Spalletti said. \"We were just unfortunate on several chances and we're still conceding too much in defense.\"\n\nStill, the scoreline was an improvement for Roma compared to recent encounters with European powers.\n\nRoma was beaten 6-1 at Barcelona in November and fell 7-1 to Bayern Munich at home last season.\n\nThe Giallorossi also lost 7-1 at home to Manchester United in the 2007 quarterfinals -- a match in which Ronaldo scored twice.\n\nWhile Madrid controlled for long stretches Wednesday, Zidane's side had trouble finding the target until Ronaldo's goal.\n\nThe visitors' only significant chance in the first half was a long-distance volley from Marcelo that just missed the target shortly after the half-hour mark.\n\nRoma relied on counterattacks and the speed of Mohamed Salah on the right flank, although it was Stephan El Shaarawy who had the better opportunities, chipping high in the 17th following a precise cross from newly-signed Diego Perotti.\n\nEl Shaarawy, who was recently loaned from AC Milan, also had a chance seconds before the break but was stopped by Raphael Varane just as he was about to shoot.\n\nRonaldo, meanwhile, struggled to make an impact early on, shooting a long free kick well wide for his only sight of goal in the first period\n\nNeither side managed a shot on target in the first half.\n\nEarly in the second, James Rodriguez had his head bloodied when William Vainqueur reached up with his boot to intercept a cross from Ronaldo and made contact with the Colombia international.\n\nRoma substitute Edin Dzeko set up Vainqueur for a long-distance attempt at an equalizer that went wide and Ronaldo then nearly scored again. His delicate header made fans inside the Stadio Olimpico hold their breath as it went across the box before ending up just wide.\n\nJese, who replaced Rodriguez, then had an easy time beating Roma defender Lucas Digne for Madrid's second goal, with goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny having no chance.\n\nRonaldo then exited to a standing ovation from the small pocket of about 1,000 Madrid fans, who chanted \"Ronaldo, Ronaldo.\"", "He has gone into major international tournaments before not at full fitness\n\nWayne Rooney is set to be out of action for between six weeks and two months after damaging knee ligaments.\n\nThe 30-year-old suffered the injury during Manchester United's defeat by Sunderland last weekend.\n\nRooney's injury will concern England manager Roy Hodgson ahead of Euro 2016 this summer.

On his return he does not score for five games.\n\nMarch 2010\n\nRooney injures his ankle in a Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich, sparking fears he may miss the World Cup.

His ambition is to take them all the way to the May 15 final in Basle, Switzerland.\n\nA few teams in the world can think about winning the Europa League and I think we are one of these teams,' said Klopp. 'We don't have to say \"We have no chance\". But if you look at the teams in the competition now it is like a little Champions League. There are a lot of high quality teams in it. Sometimes you can look at winning a cup as the shortest way to get somewhere.\n\n'For sure the Europa League is not the shortest way to get to the Champions League, it is a really hard race. The chance to qualify for the Champions League makes it more interesting, ask Sevilla who would have qualified many times with this rule.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund coach returns to Germany for first time since switch to Anfield\n\nKlopp also got involved firing in a shot and will be hoping his side can hit the target on route to the final\n\n'What can I say, we are in the last 32. We can see the line. But I cannot say now, 'This is our only chance of being in the Champions League. It's a chance. How many points in the league are we away from the Champions League? Nine. So, yeah, at this moment I would say we have a better chance this way at the moment. Maybe the top four clubs will have a crisis. But we have to solve our own problems. We have to be at the highest motivation for the game without thinking about the last moment and knowing the possibility.' Those views were echoed by Nathaniel Clyne, who said: 'We are looking to win as many games as we can. We know Augsburg will be difficult but we want to get into the next round and keep winning so that we teach the final. It would be great if we could win that cup. We know it offers a route to the Champions League and we are taking it seriously.'\n\nAugsburg have endured a difficult season in the Bundesliga - they are currently 14th and only a point above the relegation zone - but that will not them prevent them attacking Liverpool and Klopp is wary they will want to claim a big scalp, given locals are calling it the biggest game in their history.\n\n'I am sure that's how it should be,' said Klopp. 'If I wasn't here and Augsburg play against Liverpool it is still the biggest game in their history. But still, they played against Bayern Munich in their last game and a few years ago they were the European champions.\n\n'Of course, they played against them a few times last season so it's not that big anymore and now we come the first time. I don't think there is extra motivation because I am there. I have never had a problem with their players or something like this.\n\n'But it is a special situation because it's Europa League and it's a small club that can earn a lot of money. For a club like Augsburg the competition is the biggest money they can get in Europe. The Champions League is far away - they have not a real chance.\n\n'So these clubs want to go for the Europa League and no-one would ever ask them a question like 'don't you think it's better to go out of European football and concentrate on the league'. Maybe in this case when you have 21 points and are in a difficult situation you could say \"yes\"!\n\n'But from outside you will not see this at the game. They will fight for their life, for sure, because for them it is an absolute highlight. I've played a lot of times against them, and that makes the preparation easier but that is all. In the end, they will fight for everything.'", "Not featured since January 9th and Louis van Gaal has demanded more\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger again acted as cheerleader, after he was spotted court-side on Wednesday to watch girlfriend Ana Ivanovic in action during her second-round victory at the WTA Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.\n\nThe Manchester United midfielder, who is currently sidelined with a knee injury and has not appeared since the 1-0 FA Cup victory over Sheffield United on January 9th, looked on as Ivanovic ousted defending champion and top-seeded Romanian Simona Halep 7-6, 6-2.\n\nAfter breaking Halep's serve in the first game of the second set, the 17th-ranked Serbian progressed to the Dubai quarter-finals for the fourth time in her career.\n\nBastian Schweinsteiger was in Dubai to cheer on girlfriend Ana Ivanovic who won her match\n\nIvanovic reached the quarter-finals after beating Simona Halep 7-6 6-2 on Wednesday\n\nVictory send the Serbian tennis star into the Dubai quarter finals for the fourth time in her career\n\nHaving arrived from Bayern Munich for \u00a36.5million in July 2015, the World Cup winner has featured in only 13 of United's 26 Premier League games and a combination of injuries and poor form, have seen the German have an indifferent first season at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile life on the field has certainly been mixed, off it appears to be far more straightforward for the 31-year-old, who according to German newspaper Bild, is set to marry the tennis ace -

We have to wait and see how long that takes. I cannot say,\" the Dutch manager added.\n\n\"He scores a lot of goals so he is very important for us. We know that but we have to cope with that.\n\n\"Certainly in 2016, he has scored and that's why we had a good run in matches until Sunderland. But we have to cope with that. Everybody can be injured and also the captain can be injured.\"\n\nIf Rooney's absence is as lengthy as has been suggested, it will be a setback for both United and England.\n\nUnited's 2-1 loss to Sunderland last weekend left them fifth in England's top flight and six points off the top-four spot -- the club's \"minimum requirement\" in the under-pressure Van Gaal's words -- that would secure entry into next season's Champions League.\n\nThey have 12 rounds of Premier League fixtures left in which to overhaul fourth-placed local rivals Manchester City, who have already announced that Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola will be their new manager next season.\n\nDefeat in Denmark would merely add to the pressure on Van Gaal, who has said winning the Europa League now offers United their best chance of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nMeanwhile there is ongoing speculation that former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is set to replace Van Gaal at Old Trafford come the end of the current campaign.\n\nEngland also have two friendly internationals against Germany and the Netherlands next month ahead of their participation at the Euro 2016 finals in France.\n\nRoy Hodgson, the England manager, said on Saturday that his skipper Rooney -- England's leading all-time goalscorer -- will be a \"player we need to depend upon\" at the Euros.\n\nRooney is United's top scorer this season with 14 goals in all competitions and has found the back of the net three times in four appearances for England this term.", "On Thursday, Borussia Dortmund will host FC Porto in the Westfalenstadion in the round of 32 of the Europa League, in which two contenders for the crown will go head to head.\n\nFC Porto might have cursed their luck when drawing Borussia Dortmund after finishing third in their Champions League group. After all, the Black and Yellows are regarded by oddsmakers as one of the favourites to win the competition.\n\nHowever, Dortmund being tipped to lift the trophy in May has little to do with their underwhelming displays throughout the group stages, which saw them ultimately finish second behind Russian side FC Krasnodar in a group they should have easily won.\n\nThough, the club cannot be faulted for neglecting the Europa League at the beginning of their campaign, as qualifying for the Champions League was the number one priority. It made anything apart the Bundesliga seem like a pesky inconvenience.\n\nUnsurprisingly, lacklustre performances by often heavily rotated teams on Thursday nights were the consequences, all the while die Schwarzgelben mesmerized their fans on the weekend, painting a contrasting picture.\n\nFast forward from the grim midweek action in October to the present and the outset ahead of Porto is an entirely different one. Borussia Dortmund comfortably sit in second place in the Bundesliga and it would take something extraordinary to change that. The targeted Champions League qualification is all but in the bag with a comforting 13-point margin down to third-placed Bayer Leverkusen, while league leaders FC Bayern are already out of reach, given the eight-point gap.\n\nHence, the Black and Yellows only have the cup competitions left in which to find excitement. With the domestic cup semifinal taking place in April, the Europa League currently serves as the only competition to provide real on-the-edge-of-the-seat tension for Borussia Dortmund fans.\n\nWhether that excitement will sustain past February remains to be seen. Manager Thomas Tuchel assessed in Wednesday's news conference that his side will have to deliver twice on the highest level in order to prevail, something they have yet to do in the Europa League.\n\nOddly enough the drab 1-0 win Dortmund eked out against last place Hannover on Saturday might be an indicator that the priorities have already shifted. BVB looked very sharp in their 3-1 cup victory against in-form VfB Stuttgart just four days ahead of Hannover. It could lead to the conclusion that the Bundesliga business has turned into the inconvenience in between European matches, but that hypothesis is yet to be upheld by the players on the field.\n\nFC Porto are a team known to take the Europa League seriously, having won the competition in 2011. They will pose a hurdle that BVB will only overcome if they can flick the switch and present themselves at their best. If Dortmund manage to do that, they will have a good chance to beat the Dragons in their own stadium and lay the groundwork.\n\nPorto won the heated \"Classico\" against rivals Benfica 2-1 last Friday, but the result might be deceiving. It took an outstanding performance by Iker Casillas to mask Porto's defensive frailties in order to claim all three points at the Estadio da Luz.\n\nDefensive worries will remain for coach Jose Peseiro, who has to make do without several players due to injuries and suspensions. Especially at the back the Dragons are harshly decimated. Centre-back and captain Maicon has been shipped out to Sao Paulo after committing a mistake that led to a goal and later walking off the pitch, signalizing an apparent injury in the 2-1 home loss to Arouca just two weeks ago.\n\nNineteen-year-old Chidozie Awaziem, who filled in for Maicon, is not eligible to play in the Europa League, which forces Peseiro to call up a centre-back from Porto's reserves. Furthermore, right-back Maxi Pereira will miss the match due to suspension as well as midfield cog Danilo Pereira, who usually shields the back line from central midfield.\n\nBorussia Dortmund should find a way to exploit Porto's personnel malaise by fielding their best XI -- barring Ilkay Gundogan, who is doubtful with a cold. The absence of Gundogan would mark a tough loss for BVB on the European stage, as the central midfielder has been an absolute key player for the side. His passes unlock opponents on a regular basis and without him, Dortmund tend to struggle in retaining possession, just as much as creating scoring chances.\n\nPoor old Roman Weidenfeller, who is the starting goalkeeper only in the Europa League, is sidelined with an infection and will have to wait for the return leg to pick up some scarce playing time.\n\nOn paper, Dortmund should just have the edge over Porto in their home tie, if they can deny Porto's illustrious attack, especially Yacine Brahimi, who is the type of player that Dortmund have trouble handling. The Algerian international is equipped with pace and can create momentum for his side by dribbling past one or two defenders.\n\nIt's up to Tuchel to set up a side that won't run into an open knife. After all, it's the coach's first knock-out match on the European stage. Whether his team will be firing on all cylinders in a tie that could very well take place in the Champions League is in the end down to him. The pressure is firmly on BVB ahead of a promising Europa League tie.", "Berlin (AFP) - Jurgen Klopp is back in Germany for the first time as Liverpool manager on Thursday hunting a Europa League win at Augsburg in his quest to quench the Reds' thirst for silverware.\n\nKlopp returns to the touchline of a Bundesliga ground for the first time since the 48-year-old quit Borussia Dortmund last season, before he replaced Brendan Rogers as Liverpool boss in October.\n\nFans have clamoured for tickets for the round of 32, first-leg clash at the WWK Arena in deepest Bavaria to see Liverpool, who are unbeaten in their six European games under Klopp and buoyed by Sunday's 6-0 thrashing of Aston Villa.\n\nAugsburg received 5,000 applications for just 2,000 away tickets for the Liverpool game, which will be a 26,160 sell-out.\n\nThe return leg is at Anfield on February 25, just three days before the Reds play Manchester City in the League Cup final.\n\nWhile he is glad to be back in his native country, the Liverpool boss is focused on the job in hand.\n\n\"It's nice to come back, but it's not as though I fled Germany. I only left to work,\" he said, having ordered German specialities for his squad to eat at the hotel.\n\nAround 60 journalists and 20 television cameras packed into the press room at the WWK Arena to listen to Klopp.\n\n\"During the draw, I wasn't thinking 'please let it be a German club'. At that point, I'd only been away for four months,\" he admitted.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to coming to Germany, but it's work and it's not as though I've been waiting for it.\n\n\"Nothing much has changed apart from the fact that I may now answer the questions here in German.\"\n\nLiverpool arrive in Bavaria buoyed by their drubbing of Villa which left them eighth in the Premier League.\n\nAfter a mid-season injury glut, Liverpool are getting back to a fully fit squad.\n\nDaniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi all played in the drubbing of Villa after recent injuries.\n\nSturridge, who scored the opener at Villa Park, made his first start since early October, while it was Coutinho's first start since January 5.\n\nKlopp is expected to name a strong side, as Liverpool do not have any games between the two legs after being knocked out of the FA Cup by West Ham United earlier this month.\n\nAfter the League Cup, the Europa League presents Klopp with a second chance at silverware in his first season as he looks to bring some European glory back to Merseyside.\n\n\"I have never said that we have to win a title, but people here make it clear how important silverware is,\" said Klopp.\n\nWhile the Reds are on the rise, hosts Augsburg are battling to stay up.\n\nThey are 14th in the Bundesliga, just a point from the relegation places, after Sunday's 3-1 defeat at home to runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, but the Germans want to show what they can do.\n\nFrom his Dortmund days, Klopp knows all about Augsburg, who qualified for the Europa League by finishing fifth last season, their highest placing in the club's history.\n\nKlopp has faced Augsburg 10 times while in charge of either Dortmund or Mainz and has lost only once in five games as a coach at the WWK Arena.\n\nThe Bavarians have struggled with their key playmaker Daniel Baier out with a fractured ankle since the start of January.\n\n\"They have a good counter-attacking game and are very physical,\" said Klopp, who said he expects Augsburg to attack his side to prove themselves at this level.\n\n\"They haven't got much of a big cushion in the Bundesliga, so you could understand it if they had wanted to say: 'We'll be saying goodbye to the Europa League'.\n\n\"But this is a competition where they want to be seen, that was always very important from the very beginning for them.\"", "Understandably, you probably haven't been paying attention to the recent signings by teams in the Chinese Super League.\n\nIt's not like Jiangsu Suning

themselves for a serious test as Augsburg gear up for the \"biggest game in their history\".\n\nThe Bavarian outfit are locked in a relegation battle domestically but the Reds boss is wary of the threat they pose in the Europa League last 32 tie.\n\nKlopp's return to Germany for the first time since he took over at Anfield last October has created huge interest in his homeland.\n\nAugsburg are relishing their first ever European campaign and have never faced English opposition before. A 30,000 sell-out crowd is expected for Thursday night's first leg at the WWK Arena.\n\n\"It won't be too easy,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"Bundesliga clubs are never easy to play against and especially a club like Augsburg, who are a special story in Germany.\n\n\"They have said it is the biggest game in their history.

They will fight for their lives, for sure, because for them it is an absolute highlight.\"\n\nAugsburg have enjoyed a remarkable rise. They were playing in the fourth tier of German football back in 2002 after being dogged by financial problems.\n\nIn 2011 they were promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in their history and qualified for the Europa League after finishing fifth last term.\n\nMarkus Weinzierl's side have found life tougher this season and are struggling in 14th place. But they advanced to the last 32 after coming second to Athletic Bilbao in Group L.\n\n\"It is a similar story to my former club Mainz, with a little bit more history than Mainz had,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"One of the most famous German footballers played there - Bernd Schuster - but it took them a long time to come to the Bundesliga and now they are there with a really good manager. Markus Weinzierl is one of the highest-rated managers in Germany at this moment.\n\n\"A lot of clubs are thinking about him but he is still in Augsburg and he is a very good manager.\n\n\"They are having a few problems this season - 21 points, only one point above the relegation line - but they came through their group with a spectacular last game - last game, last second, last goal against Partizan Belgrade.\n\n\"Usually they play with a similar team but one or two of their key players are injured at the moment. That is the biggest difference.\"\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund manager's record against Augsburg is impressive. He has won five and drawn three out of 10 meetings.\n\nDoing his homework on the Reds' opponents has been easier than usual and he has urged his defenders to keep close tabs on striker Raul Bobadilla.\n\nThe Paraguay international netted his 11th goal of the campaign in Sunday's 3-1 league defeat to Bayern Munich. He also scored at Anfield for Young Boys against Liverpool back in 2012.\n\n\"I've played a lot of times against them and that makes the preparation easier but in the end they will fight for everything,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"They have a good mixture of experience and young players and made some really good transfers.\n\n\"They have players with big potential and have one of the most physical strikers in Europe in Raul Bobadilla, who you need a navigation system to drive around!\n\n\"He is a real worker and difficult to defend. Their wingers are quick and usually one of the best players in the Bundesliga is their playmaker Daniel Baier, who plays No 6 or No 8, but he is injured for our game which is a big problem for them.\n\n\"They have experienced centre-halves too and good full-backs. Their manager said it would be better for them if Liverpool had another (non-German) manager because they would never have been to Augsburg. We know everything about this team.\"\n\nThere is massive media interest in Germany surrounding Klopp's trip to Bavaria. But the Liverpool boss insists it's a much bigger deal for others than it is for him.\n\nKlopp added: \"I was there for 47 years. It's no problem, I know this country!\n\n\"I will not be surprised. Augsburg is a nice city. It is more special for other people because there are not too many German managers working in foreign countries.\n\n\"Most of my colleagues are working in Germany so if a German manager works somewhere else and comes back, yes it is possible to be a more interesting story but, for us and for me especially, it is a Europa League game.\n\n\"From the first moment I've said this is a very important tournament for me. We did a job in the group to get to the last 32 and now the target is the next round.\n\n\"If I wasn't here and Augsburg play against Liverpool it is still the biggest game in their history.

You don\u00b4t always have to be among the favorites for the cup to be happy.\n\nAnd honestly, who expected KAA Gent and VfL Wolfsburg to be still left in the competition in the knock-out stages? Many football fans around the world expected Manchester United to top the group but were then upstaged by Germany's Wolfsburg.\n\nGent now, more than Wolfsburg, is a shining example that you can be successful in football and happy without super stars if you manage to create team spirit. Gent and Wolfsburg have reached the round of the last 16 for the first time in their club histories after posting their biggest ever successes. But when the last 16 was drawn, it was clear only one of the brave underdogs will proceed to the quarterfinals. For each the tie was going to be their personal final three month before the real final will take place.\n\nAfter the first leg, \"minnows\" Wolfsburg seems on the way to the next round while Gent's dreams seem to be already over. Julian Draxler (2) and Max Kruse scored the goals for a 3-2 victory few expected. And more: Wolfsburg fans rubbed their eyes. Was this their team that till now had lacked speed, team-spirit and determination in the Bundesliga? On the pitch in Gent, Wolfsburg had everything, at least up until the last 15 minutes when Gent almost managed to turn things around after Wolfsburg failed to put up the shutters when 3-0 up. Instead of a clear victory, Wolfsburg has \"only\" a 3-2 victory to take back home.\n\nWolfsburg undoubtedly has problems in the domestic league where they lie eighth and far off qualifying for the Champions League next season. The current campaign in Europe's top club competition is now designed to make up for the crisis back home. And more: It could well be the turning point for a struggling team and their coach Dieter Hecking, who is under fire after the performances in the Bundesliga.\n\n\"We are still counting on qualifying again for the Champions League. Fourth place at the end of the current Bundesliga season is still well within our reach. But no doubt, to reach the quarterfinal of this season's Champions League, will have an enormous impact on our club and our team,\" said Wolfsburg CEO Klaus Allofs.\n\nIn the Bundesliga, Wolfsburg last weekend won the first game (2-0 against league newcomer FC Ingolstadt) after seven games without a win. Widespread discussions began about the future of Wolfsburg as a football city.\n\nAdditionally the future seemed to be insecure after the club owners Volkswagen has plunged itself into a deep economic crisis. Now Wolfsburg's fans can hope for better times as qualification for the quarterfinals guarantees several millions of euros. \"You could see clearly that the team is not cool enough after we had problems in the Bundesliga,\" Allofs continued.\n\nDreams and expectations have been mountain-high in Wolfsburg. The club from Germany's north was meant to rise and take on the role as the new challenger for the country's top dogs, Bayern Munich. Last season with key figure Kevin de Bruyne still in the side, Wolfsburg fulfilled most expectations by winning the 2015 German Cup and finishing as runners-up in the championship. Then De Bruyne left for Manchester City for 80 million euros and the club lost its pace and tumbled into a crisis.\n\nAs for Kevin de Bruyne's importance for the team, one only has to look at his new club who have gone off the boil ever since the Belgian got injured. Wolfsburg's coach Hecking said, \"Kevin de Bruyne is injured and since then things haven't been going that well for Manchester City. Again we talk about his influence for a team like Manchester. If you look at that you can imagine what Kevin de Brunye was for Wolfsburg.\" It could well take some time to replace a star like De Bruyne.\n\nLike Man City, Wolfsburg is not only missing De Bruyne's speed but his winning mentality, at least until now. The measures Wolfsburg have taken to replace De Bruyne have not quite worked out till now. Max Kruse, Andre Schuerrle and Julian Draxler (all three are candidates for Germany's Euro 2016 squad) have all not been able to close the gap De Bruyne left.\n\nNow, all of a sudden, Draxler and Kruse opened the door to a presumably better future. There is still a long way to go. Though Wolfsburg did not manage to perform solidly over the full 90 minutes, the victory in the first leg between the underdogs could be a start to better things after all.

Last weekend's 2-1 win at Darmstadt stretched its unbeaten run in the league to six games for the first time this season.\n\nClub top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will likely feature for Dortmund after sitting out last weekend, while midfielder Nuri Sahin made his comeback against Porto after nearly a year out injured.\n\nBayern will be hoping to avoid any further injuries against Darmstadt before its trip to Turin for the first leg of its Champions League Round of 16 tie against Juventuson Tuesday.\n\nBayern defenders Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber are all ruled out and emergency signing Serdar Tasci is yet to play following a head injury sustained in his first training session.\n\nBayern's makeshift back-four of Philipp Lahm, Joshua Kimmich, David Alaba and Juan Bernat have another chance to play together before the all-important Juventus clash.\n\nDarmstadt, back in the Bundesliga after 33 years, has little hope of upsetting the home side, especially with five players ruled out through suspension.\n\nMoenchengladbach is yet to rediscover the form it displayed when Andre Schubert took over and matched a Bundesliga record by starting with six wins. Three defeats and one win in 2016 have seen the side slip to seventh.\n\nCologne, unbeaten in three games, could draw level with an away win Saturday.\n\n\"It's always something special.\" Cologne captain Matthias Lehmann said of the derby. \"We want to deliver a good game Saturday and keep the momentum going.\"\n\nHertha Berlin is another side yet to click into gear in 2016. Pal Dardai's side is four league games without a win and last weekend's 2-0 defeat in Stuttgart saw it surrender third place on goal difference to Leverkusen.\n\n\"Every team has a phase in the season in which it doesn't flow so well. Perhaps we're having this phase now,\" said Dardai, who identified Saturday's home match against Wolfsburg as a \"key game.\"\n\nWolfsburg ended its own poor run - seven games without a win - with a 2-0 victory over Ingolstadt last weekend but coach Dieter Hecking has warned against complacency.\n\n\"Whoever thinks they can relax now is on the wrong path,\" Hecking said.\n\nWolfsburg conceded two late goals to squander a 3-0 lead over Gent in the Champions League on Wednesday. The game ended 3-2 and came at a cost, with confirmation that right-back Sebastian Jung tore a cruciate ligament in his left knee and will be ruled out for around six months.\n\n(This story has been corrected to indicate the 22nd round is about to be played, not the 21st.)", "MILAN: Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri believes Friday's away trip to Bologna will be crucial to keeping title rivals Napoli at bay as the champions begin preparations for the imminent, bigger challenge of Bayern Munich.\n\nJuventus, the four-time consecutive champions, sit top of Serie A with a one-point lead on Napoli after a 1-0 win over Maurizio Sarri's title-chasers in Turin.\n\nLeague officials moved Juve's weekend Serie A fixture against Bologna to Friday to allow the Bianconeri an extra day to prepare for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Bayern on Tuesday.\n\nOn paper, it doesn't have the allure of a clash with Serie A's bigger sides. But Roberto Donadoni has transformed Bologna in recent months and for Allegri, Friday's match remains crucial to their chances of making it five 'scudetto' championships on the trot.\n\n\"Tomorrow we'll play our best possible side because Donadoni is doing some great work at Bologna, and they have nothing to lose against us,\" said Allegri, who has recently played down reports of a move to take over at Chelsea next season.\n\n\"This match is worth a small part of the scudetto. We need the three points. Napoli, who are one point behind, won't give us an inch. We have to either maintain or improve our lead.\"\n\nWith Napoli not hosting AC Milan until Monday evening due to their Europa League commitments on Thursday, a win at Bologna would see Juventus sit on a four-point lead over the weekend.\n\nBut with Bayern on the horizon and several players coming off the treatment table, Allegri is expected to reshuffle in a bid to keep as much powder dry as possible for Tuesday.\n\nSimone Zaza came off the bench to hit Juve's late winner against Napoli last week and the 24-year-old could force Argentine striker Paulo Dybala on to the subs' bench.\n\nAllegri said, however, he was yet to choose whether Dybala, Mario Mandzukic or Alvaro Morata would partner Zaza: \"Zaza will start at Bologna, but I don't know who with yet.\"\n\nJuventus upset predictions to make the Champions League final last May, only to be outclassed 3-1 by Barcelona.\n\nAlthough pundits are predicting Bayern will end Juve's run in Europe at the knockout phase this time around, Juve's elimination of Real Madrid in last year's semis means there is plenty of belief at the club.\n\nAllegri, 48, is a master at selecting the right men for the job at hand, whether Bologna or Bayern, but several players are currently fighting for full match fitness.\n\nBrazilian wingback Alex Sandro is not fit for Bologna after suffering a muscle problem but \"could be ready for Tuesday,\" said Allegri.\n\nGiorgio Chiellini missed the visit of Napoli through injury, while fellow defender Leonardo Bonucci was forced off during the first half. Both are expected to be fit for Friday.\n\nAllegri left doubts, however, on German midfielder Sami Khedira and Croatian striker Mandzukic. Both could be rested on Friday in a bid to be fully fit for Tuesday.", "BERLIN: Pep Guardiola's horrendous injury list at Bayern Munich is \"no accident or misfortune\", but down to the wrong training structure at the German giants, says one of Germany's leading sports scientists.\n\nBayern face Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League in Turin next Tuesday with Guardiola's squad so decimated by injury that he did not have a single fit centre-back for Sunday's 3-1 league win at Augsburg.\n\nHe hopes to have some of his walking wounded back for Saturday's league game against Darmstadt.\n\nBut Holger Badstuber's fractured ankle last Saturday was the 16th injury Bayern's star-studded squad has had to absorb this season with Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez also currently sidelined.\n\nBadstuber misses the rest of the season having only returned from seven-months out with a torn thigh in November.\n\nAnd Franck Ribery has yet to return from a thigh injury he suffered last December on just his second game back after eight months out with an ankle problem.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted in his final few months before leaving Bayern to coach Manchester City at the end of the season, Guardiola quickly answered: \"all my players fit\", but his wish has not come true.\n\nsystematic errors\n\nLars Lienhard is one of Europe's top sports scientists, specialising in the nervous system, in short, training the brain.\n\nHe helped prepare the Germany squad which won the 2014 World Cup and is currently working with Germany's athletes ahead of the Rio de Janerio Olympics.\n\nIn an interview with SID, an AFP subsidiary, Lienhard used Bayern Munich as an example of what can happen when players come back from injury too soon.\n\n\"When something breaks or tears, no one should be speaking about misfortune or it being an accident,\" said Lienhard.\n\n\"It stands to reason that systematic errors in the training loading, and motion control, of the players are the cause.\"\n\nGuardiola has vehemently defended his training techniques and insisted he does not rush players back from injury, after receiving some criticism in the media here.\n\nHe has denied there is any problem with his medical staff, especially after team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt resigned last April after being blamed for a 3-1 loss at Porto in the Champions League.\n\nBut Lienhard says pinning the blame for Bayern's horrendous casualty list on Guardiola or the club's medical staff is too simple.\n\n\"Anyone who blames a high volume of injuries on the club doctors or head coach is not looking deeply enough,\" he said.\n\n\"The rehabilitation, training structure and load management (put on the players as they return from injury) are the key factors.\"\n\nAnd Lienhard says players who are susceptible to injury, like Ribery and Badstuber, are prone to further problems as they subconsciously try to avoid picking up future ailments in training or matches.\n\n\"Any player who has a long history of injury is effectively like a protective reflex on two legs,\" he said, adding that a player like Badstuber needs neurological, as well as physical rehabilitation, to break the cycle of injuries.\n\nBadstuber's fractured ankle, his fourth major injury since 2012, is just the latest bout of what has been dubbed Bayern's 'disease of the boot'.\n\nWhen Germany defender Jerome Boateng tore his groin in Bayern's first game of 2016, Thomas Mueller came up with a typically succinct appraisal.\n\n\"Just before Christmas we only had 14 fit players.

While Dortmund and Leverkusen clash on Sunday, while one of Germany's fiercest derbies goes on in Gladbach.\n\nAn illness that has spread around the Borussia Dortmund dressing room has not slowed their roll. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Roman Weidenfeller had to miss the club's Europa League match on Thursday, but that did not stop the yellow and blacks from taking a commanding lead in their tie against Porto. Their feverish fixture list will not let up though as they travel to Leverkusen for a big Sunday match.\n\nThomas Tuchel is more likely to cook up a remedy to Dortmund's packed schedule now that he has healed midfielders to recall upon. Nuri Sahin returned after a year-long injury layoff to put in a solid hour for Dortmund on Thursday. Tuchel also has Gonzalo Castro in reserve after leaving the midfielder out of the squad in midweek.\n\nDortmund's task may be a tad easier as well, with Leverkusen still searching for the right solution in attack without Javier Hernandez. They struggled to beat Darmstadt after Werder Bremen knocked them out of the German Cup earlier in the week, and ground out another one-goal win in the Europa League. Stefan Kiessling has been a different player trying to lead the line on his own, and has yet to score this season without \"Chicharito\" at his side.\n\nThe fixtures between these two clubs have been tight in the recent past, Leverkusen having the more success with two wins, two draws, and a loss in the most recent encounters. However, Dortmund played them off their own field in the reverse fixture this season, but with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's inconsistent showings in recent rounds, they may not replicate that performance in Leverkusen.\n\nFiery Rhein-derby expected in Gladbach\n\nJust as it was last season when the Cologne fans stormed the field, this rheinische Derby will be a [adjective] affair. Cologne fans are expected to have a demonstration before the game, but the match should be a display worth watching. Only three points separate Gladbach from Cologne in the Bundesliga table, setting the stage for an early six-pointer for in their respective hunts for a European place.\n\n\"I am excited for a match with such big emotions,\" Andre Schubert said on Thursday.\n\nCologne's defense has been able to handle most of the opposing attacks thrown at them this season, mainly due to Peter St\u00f6ger's conservative tactics. Part of his new formula is playing Jonas Hector in midfield, one St\u00f6ger believes has helped the team's organization in recent weeks.\n\n\"Because of his game intelligence, Jonas is a player who has mastered all positions, on which the organization, buildup play and organization comes out,\" St\u00f6ger said.\n\nHector's presence in the middle will be important to slow down Gladbach's impressive attack. With Lars Stindl and Raffael leading the charge, the Foals' attack has remained one of the best in the Bundesliga - third behind Dortmund and Bayern Munich in goals scored. Defense is where they have been the most inconsistent, and with Martin Hinteregger and Martin Stranzl expected to miss the match, they may have a hard time collecting their first clean sheet in 2016. With just one win in the new year, Gladbach need another good result if they want to build on their Bundesliga resurgence from the first half of the season.", "Manchester United owners the Glazers and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward cannot let this slow lingering death drag on any longer.\n\nLouis van Gaal's credibility as Manchester United manager is in tatters.\n\nAn admirable personal past CV is in ruins and United's own reputation is crumbling frighteningly before the Old Trafford hierarchy's eyes.\n\nThe Reds became the laughing stock of Europe in Denmark beaten by a team who were only formed in 1999 when United were a super power on the continent.\n\nA club who used to beat Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Juventus in the Champions League totally humiliated by Midtjylland in the Europa League is completely unacceptable.\n\nTwo years ago next week Woodward took a picture on his mobile phone of the scoreboard at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Athens when United went down 2-0 to Olympiakos in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nIt was said he snapped it to remind him that United should never sink so low again. Well they have. In fact, they haven't just sunk as low, they have plumbed new depths.\n\nThe Greeks were 20 points clear in the Super League back in 2014. Midtjylland hadn't played since December 10 and hadn't won a match since November.\n\nDavid Moyes was afforded 56 more days as United manager back then and did actually win five of his last 10 matches in charge in that time. Van Gaal's stock is now so low how can the Reds hierarchy argue he should get any more time to turn this around after this latest abysmal effort.\n\nI wrote 'enough is enough' after the dire display against Southampton less than a month ago believing it couldn't get any worse and that it shouldn't be allowed to.\n\nAfter last Saturday's pathetic loss at Sunderland I blamed the players for a \"gutless\" performance and firmly believed it wouldn't get any worse and should be allowed to.\n\nBut then this came this Joke in Jutland. United are being dragged under and fans who paid a staggering \u00a371 for their match tickets in Midtjylland branded Van Gaal and his side as....well let's just say shocking!\n\nSocial media went berserk with supporters justifiably ranting about the sorry state the club are in. Fans on United's own TV channel MUTV were equalling scathing.\n\nIs anybody at Old Trafford listening?\n\nThey'd had a bellyful of it and unless Ed Woodward and the Glazers act they will be facing open revolt where it will hurt them most...season ticket sales. Forcing the fans into that desperate action shouldn't be allowed to happen.\n\nVan Gaal privately said to Woodward after the Boxing day defeat at Stoke that if the club thought someone else could do a better job then he'd walk away, without a severance package it is understood, why they didn't snap his hand off then is bemusing.\n\nIf it was down to loyalty and the belief it was an Alex Ferguson circa 1990 type situation that demanded patience then surely that bizarre notion has now been obliterated by what went on in Denmark.\n\nNever mind Jose Mourinho, never mind Mauricio Pochettino at this moment in time Van Gaal's successor doesn't matter, it is about doing the sensible thing and realising finally that this just isn't working and isn't going to.\n\nPut LVG and United fans out of their misery NOW.\n\nREAD MORE: Van Gaal admits fans' expletive-laden criticism is RIGHT after Midtjylland defeat\n\nREAD MORE: Van Gaal: United fans didn't think it could get any worse... it just did", "Arsenal's bid to become the first side to win three consecutive FA Cups in over a century resumes against a side they have disposed of on their way to both of the last two trophies.\n\nAfter the thrilling final of 2014, in which Arsenal overturned a two goal deficit to claim Arsene Wenger's first trophy in nine years, Hull were brushed aside in the third round in 2015 with Per Mertesacker and Alexis Sanchez on the score sheet.\n\nAs in the fourth round, when Burnley were knocked out thanks to goals from Calum Chambers and Sanchez, Arsenal will host a side flying high in the Championship, with Hull battling the Clarets and Middlesbrough for automatic promotion.\n\nSteve Bruce will be without two key squad members as both Chuba Akpom and Isaac Hayden will be unable to play against their parent club.

And who had a day to forget?\n\n2/23 Petr Cech: 7\n\nRarely called upon for much of the game, but was not found wanting when he was forced to dive low to keep out Vardy's header early on. When needed he was reliably brisk off his line.\n\n3/23 Hector Bellerin: 6\n\nThose fearful of the pace of Leicester seemed to have forgotten the excellence of Bellerin, who was often the man to track Vardy. He was rarely caught out, though the danger of Leicester did curb his more attacking tendencies.\n\n4/23 Per Mertesacker: 7\n\nThe captain found himself a major talking point ahead of kick-off but, as was the case against Bayern Munich and Manchester City, he raised his game for the occasion. Read the game superbly, cutting much of the supply to Leicester's frontline.\n\n5/23 Laurent Koscielny: 5\n\nA horrific challenge on Kante moments before Leicester's goal ought to have brought a red and left Wenger with little choice but to haul his first-choice centre-back off at the break. For all the talk of pressure on Mertesacker in the build-up it was to be the Frenchman who let Wenger down.\n\nCalum Chambers: 6\n\nHis introduction led to much concerned murmuring at the Emirates but he did rather well, clearing Leicester's long balls and sweeping in behind when Vardy looked to break.\n\n6/23 Nacho Monreal: 6\n\nHad done such a good job in holding back Mahrez that it seemed particularly cruel he should be the one to give away the penalty. He had been the first defender in months to get a grip of one of Leicester's star man and it was the only blot in an excellent display.\n\n7/23 Francis Coquelin: 7\n\nThe whole structure of the Arsenal side looked better than it has been in two months with Coquelin in the side. He won the ball, set counters and kept possession time and again. A shame for him that his opposite number shone so bright.\n\nTheo Walcott: 7\n\nOf late Walcott's cameos off the bench have suggested a man out of contention but he changed the course of the game with his ability to get in behind. Took his goal superbly.\n\n8/23 Aaron Ramsey: 7\n\nWith a reliable anchorman alongside him Ramsey revelled in the opportunities to push play forward. Particularly in the opening stages he set the tone for Arsenal's attacks, with precise passing and smart movement.\n\n9/23 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain: 6\n\nOn his 100th appearance for the club he still remains an enigma. Bright in the opening 10 minutes he then slipped into bad habits, giving the ball away and running into blind alleys.\n\nDanny Welbeck: 6\n\nHad his chances even in the brief 10 minutes he had on the field. An impressive late flick on Ozil's delivery secured a victory for Arsenal and the most wonderful of stories for Welbeck, playing his first game in 10 months.\n\n10/23 Mesut Ozil: 6\n\nFound himself swarmed by multiple Leicester players whenever he picked up the ball and, with the energetic Drinkwater and Kante tracking him, struggled to find space to deliver a pass.\n\n11/23 Alexis Sanchez: 6\n\nA hive of energy throughout, but the cutting edge is still lacking. As time slipped away from Arsenal they turned to their star man, but he could not find the net and wasted several presentable chances.\n\n12/23 Olivier Giroud: 6\n\nEmbraced the physical duel with Morgan and Huth, providing a valuable outball for Ramsey and Coquelin when they won the ball around the area. However his lack of finesse when presented with half-chances cost Arsenal.\n\n13/23 Kasper Schmeichel: 8\n\nFantastic in the dying minutes, making a string of vital saves from Giroud and company. Before then he had been Leicester's master of the dark arts, slowing play and giving his side time to breath.\n\n14/23 Danny Simpson: 5\n\nWill not be the last defender to find Sanchez too much to deal with and would have been entitled to hope for more support from Mahrez. He should, though, have known better than to grapple with Giroud when already booked.\n\n15/23 Wes Morgan: 7\n\nAn immovable rock as Leicester looked to weather the Arsenal storm. When a cross came into the area you could all but guarantee the captain would be there, an inch or two ahead of Giroud, to whip it away.\n\n16/23 Robert Huth: 7\n\nDominant in the air but also smart enough to allow Giroud to win the ball when he dropped deep. His willingness to hurl himself in front of any ball was an exemplar that every Leicester player followed.\n\n17/23 Christian Fuchs: 6\n\nAfter struggling early on his duel with Oxlade-Chamberlain and Bellerin on Leicester's left was one of the game's most absorbing moments, and one where Fuchs kept coming out on top in the later stages.\n\n18/23 Riyad Mahrez: 5\n\nStruggled to impose himself on the game, with Monreal and Coquelin doubling him whenever the ball came his way. Bar a flurry at the start of the second period he lacked the space to operate and could not complain when taken off.\n\nMarcin Wasilewski: 6\n\nDid not put a foot wrong in his unfamiliar position as right-back off the bench, he could not cope with Monreal out wide but he paid close attention to Sanchez.\n\n19/23 N'Golo Kante: 8\n\nHad likely covered every blade of grass within the opening 10 minutes and continued to do so. In mere moments he went from winning the ball back off Sanchez in defence to flashing a curling effort from left-wing that brought out a fine save.\n\n20/23 Danny Drinkwater: 7\n\nProvided everything Ranieri could want from his midfield in a match like this, pressing the ball but also showing an unerring eye for the pass that would release a team-mate.\n\n21/23 Marc Albrighton: 6\n\nOffered invaluable support to Fuchs out wide, though he was rarely seen going forward. Never made a mistake and did great work in the later minutes to repel Arsenal.\n\n22/23 Jamie Vardy: 7\n\nHis mere presence was as effective a weapon as Leicester had in the first half. He had contributed little until he won the penalty but from then on he was a livewire, offering enough in behind to give Leicester a threat even with ten men.\n\n23/23 Shinji Okazaki: 5\n\nPressed, harried and chased as much as anyone in the Leicester side, but rarely to any significant effect as Arsenal monopolised the ball. His one real chance saw him caught offside before blazing over the bar and he was the logical player to make way early.\n\nBournemouth 0 Arsenal 2 (Premier League, 7/2/15)\n\nArsenal 0 Southampton 0 (Premier League, 2/2/15)\n\nArsenal 2 Burnley 1 (FA Cup, 30/1/15)\n\nArsenal 0 Chelsea 1 (Premier League, 24/1/15)\n\nTeam news and probable lineups Read more Welbeck set for first start since April as Wenger plans FA Cup changes\n\nWenger is likely to ring the changes for an FA Cup day that comes just three days ahead of the visit of Barcelona to the Emirates.

It's ended at the right time as the Champions League restarts this week, with the Blues traveling to face Paris Saint-Germain after their biggest league win this season, a 5-1 drubbing of Newcastle.\n\nPSG and Chelsea, who meet as the first-leg matches of the Round of 16 get underway, have been drawn together in the knockout rounds for the third successive year. Their recent matches have been tense and close, with Chelsea prevailing in 2014, but losing last year on away goals.\n\nPSG is great form, although the three-time defending French champion's run of 16 consecutive wins in all competitions was halted by Lille over the weekend in a goalless draw.\n\nDespite the state of emergency in France following the November attacks that left 130 people dead in the capital, about 1,400 Chelsea fans are expected at the Parc des Princes. Their arrival will be one year after a commuter was racially abused and blocked by a group of supporters from the London club from boarding a metro train.\n\nBenfica hosts Zenit Saint Petersburg In Tuesday's other match. Real Madrid travels to Roma on Wednesday for Zinedine Zidane's first Champions League match as a coach and Gent hosts Wolfsburg.\n\nHere are some things to know ahead of this week's matches:\n\nRoma forward Edin Dzeko ended an 81-day scoring drought with a goal in a 3-1 win at Carpi in Serie A on Friday.\n\nRoma appeared to be heading for a draw before Dzeko slotted in Mohamed Salah's cross six minutes from time for his first goal since November.\n\nIt's been an emotional few days for Dzeko, who recently celebrated the birth of his daughter, Una.\n\n\"It's important to always believe,\" Dzeko wrote in Italian on Instagram.\n\nDzeko joined Roma in August on loan from Manchester City and has scored six goals in 26 appearances in all competitions.\n\nRoma has won four straight under new coach Luciano Spalletti, who replaced the fired Rudi Garcia last month.\n\nAgainst Madrid, the Giallorossi will be hoping to avoid another European embarrassment after getting routed 6-1 by Barcelona in November and falling 7-1 to Bayern Munich last season.\n\nWinning the Champions League appears to be the only way Chelsea can return to Europe's elite competition next season, with the team in the bottom half of the Premier League in a dismal defense of its title.\n\nChelsea's form has improved, though, since the firing of Jose Mourinho, and the team is unbeaten in all competitions under interim coach Guus Hiddink.\n\n\"We mustn't get too carried away, it is one result. But at the same time, we have been waiting for this,\" England defender Gary Cahill said after the 5-1 win over Newcastle.\n\nCahill made his first league start this year as a replacement for center-back Kurt Zouma, the main injury absentee for the 2012 Champions League winners. Skipper John Terry is also unlikely to play after suffering a hamstring injury against Newcastle.\n\nDespite Terry's setback, the mood at the Premier League club is buoyant.\n\n\"Now we have more confidence to go there and to play. Paris have a great team, great players, but we go there to try to win the game,\" Brazilian winger Willian said.\n\nZinedine Zidane will be making his Champions League debut as head coach when Real Madrid plays at Roma.\n\n\"It brings back a lot of memories,\" Zidane said after Madrid's 4-2 win over Athletic Bilbao at the Santiago Bernabeu in the Spanish league on Saturday. \"I won it with this club as a player and as the assistant manager. It has something special. When you are a footballer, you dream of winning the World Cup every four years, and of winning the Champions League every year. We are going to fight to do it.\"\n\nReal Madrid starts the round of 16 unbeaten and with one of the Champions League's best attacks -- along with Bayern Munich -- with 19 goals scored. The team's only setback in the group stage was a 0-0 draw at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nIt is yet to lose a game under coach Zidane, who replaced Rafa Benitez last month.\n\nBenfica will be looking to rebound from a disappointing home loss in a high-profile game against rival FC Porto, a result that cost the team the lead in the Portuguese league.\n\n\"Nobody likes to lose, it's normal to have a letdown,\" Benfica coach Rui Vitoria said. \"But we have an important game right away on Tuesday and it should be enough to get us motivated again.\"\n\nBenfica had won eight consecutive games before facing Porto on Friday. It hadn't lost since December.\n\nThe club is used to facing Zenit's Portuguese manager Andres Villas-Boas, who previously coached Porto and Academica de Coimbra. Villas-Boas faced Benfica seven times in his career, winning four games and losing three.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Tales Azzoni, Andrew Dampf and Steve Douglas contributed to this story.", "BERLIN -- Pep Guardiola's dream of leading Bayern Munich to the treble for a perfect farewell from his last season in charge is in jeopardy because of a spate of injuries in the defense.\n\nHolger Badstuber is the latest, after the Germany center back broke his ankle in an innocuous training ground accident on Saturday. Badstuber underwent surgery on the same day.\n\nBayern said he will be out for three months, effectively ending his season and almost certainly ruling him out of the European Championship in France. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm needed four months to recover from a similar injury last season.\n\nBadstuber joined Germany defender Jerome Boateng and Spain international Javi Martinez on the sidelines, leaving Guardiola with a major headache before the trip to Turin for the Champions League round of 16 first-leg match against Italian league leader Juventus.\n\nDespite leading Bayern to the Bundesliga in both of his seasons so far, Guardiola arguably needs to win the Champions League for his tenure to be seen as a success, especially after predecessor Jupp Heynckes signed off with the Champions League, Bundesliga, and German Cup titles in 2013.\n\nInjuries have been a recurrent theme since Guardiola took over, leading to ongoing friction with Bayern's medical staff. With a long list of stars regularly injured, team doctor Volker Braun reportedly blamed the former Barcelona coach for rushing players back.\n\nGuardiola fell out with Braun's predecessor, Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, in similar circumstances in April 2014, when the Bayern doctor quit after 38 years at the club. Despite his resignation, Bayern's players have continued to see the 73-year-old Mueller-Wohlfahrt for treatment.\n\nBayern is eight points clear in the Bundesliga, where it is looking good for an unprecedented fourth successive title, and it has a home semifinal against Werder Bremen in the German Cup. But it is in the Champions League that the toughest tests await, as Guardiola knows well following comprehensive semifinal defeats to Real Madrid and Barcelona in 2014 and 2015, respectively.\n\nNo matter how strong Bayern is in attack, the side will need competent defenders when facing the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Co.\n\nFirst, Bayern will need to face in-form Juventus forwards Paulo Dybala, Alvaro Morata, and familiar face Mario Mandzukic, who played his part in helping Heynckes win the treble in 2013. Bayern plays Massimiliano Allegri's side away on Feb. 23 before the return leg in Munich on March 16.\n\nDefender Mehdi Benatia is yet to return from injury, Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso can be caught for pace, and the 21-year-old Joshua Kimmich, who has been filling in for recent games, is short on experience.\n\nKimmich lined up alongside left back David Alaba in central defense against Augsburg on Sunday, but they had little to do with Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller, and Arjen Robben keeping the home side busy at the other end in a 3-1 win.\n\nNone of Bayern's back four of Lahm, Kimmich, Alaba or Juan Bernat was taller than 1.8 meters (5-foot-11), indicating a possible weakness when dealing with corners or crosses.\n\n\"Then they're going to have to jump higher,\" Bayern sporting director Matthias Sammer joked.\n\nWith injuries already mounting, Bayern snapped up former Stuttgart and Germany defender Serdar Tasci on loan from Spartak Moscow on the last day of the winter transfer window as cover, only for the notion of a curse among defenders to be strengthened when he was concussed after colliding with a teammate in his first training session. Tasci missed his scheduled presentation press conference and is yet to feature for the side.\n\nBoateng is out for several months with a groin injury, while Martinez was ruled out for four weeks after undergoing surgery to remove damaged cartilage in his left knee in early February.\n\nTheir injuries increased Badstuber's importance despite his own relative lack of match practice. He was back in action only since November after 200 days out with a left hamstring injury that forced him to miss the end of last season.\n\nBadstuber has been dubbed a \"Pechvogel\" -- literally a bad-luck bird -- suggesting he suffers from a jinx or a curse as a result of his recurring injuries. He missed nearly two years with knee injuries.\n\nHis misfortune began on Dec. 1, 2012, when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee playing against Borussia Dortmund, only 11 days after he returned from a torn thigh muscle. He returned from the knee injury only to suffer a second tear as he made his comeback. Badstuber then tore a tendon in his thigh at the start of last season, before suffering the left hamstring injury last April.\n\nSince the first serious knee injury, Badstuber has made only 17 Bundesliga appearances in 39 months. He missed Bayern's Champions League triumph in 2013 as well as Germany's World Cup win in 2014.\n\n\"Once a fighter, always a fighter. Think positive. Now more than ever!\" Badstuber tweeted on Saturday, suggesting he isn't ready to throw in the towel.\n\nBadstuber has received encouragement from Germany coach Joachim Loew, who suggested he could return yet again.\n\n\"I'm certain that he'll manage it with his morale and with his top attitude,\" Loew said. \"It's unbelievable that Holger is always hit with serious injuries. It's very bitter. He was on the right path.\"\n\nBayern fans agree. In teeming rain in Augsburg on Sunday, they held a banner saying, \"Keep going! Never give up, Holger.\"\n\nBayern's fill-in defenders will need the same spirit to overcome the tough tests ahead. Guardiola's legacy at Bayern depends on it.", "The leaders remain unmoved but Italy's champions are on the up, as are the Premier League's form team.\n\n1. Barcelona (no change)\n\nAfter Wednesday's win over Sporting Gijon, Barcelona lead La Liga by six points and look likely to win their sixth Spanish title in eight seasons. Luis Enrique's men are now unbeaten in 31 games and, with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in rampant scoring form -- seemingly every game -- you have to wonder if anyone can prevent them winning another treble.\n\n2. Bayern Munich (no change)\n\nBarca's former manager might have the best-equipped side to thwart the reigning European Cup holders in the Champions League. Pep Guardiola's side face Juventus in the Round of 16 first leg next week but, in the meantime, are easing their way to another Bundesliga title. Their latest walk in the park saw them win 3-0 at Augsburg and featured another Robert Lewandowski brace.\n\n3. Juventus (+1)\n\nThey left it late by Simone Zaza's winner beat Napoli to earn Juventus a 15th consecutive Serie A win and, more importantly, lifted The Old Lady into first place in the standings. It really is remarkable to think that this same squad started the season so poorly. As it stands, Juve are another European power with hopes of a treble.\n\n4. Paris Saint-Germain (-1)\n\nLaurent Blanc rested key men for the 0-0 Ligue 1 draw against Lille -- you can do that when you lead the table by more than 20 points! -- but the big names were back against Chelsea and PSG earned a narrow 2-1 advantage. Thibaut Courtois' saves meant it wasn't a bigger win but the French side will be confident of scoring at Stamford Bridge.\n\n5. Real Madrid (no change)\n\nIt's perhaps too early to say that Luka Modric's late winner at Granada kept Madrid's title hopes alive but, had the Croatian not struck a superb goal from long range, Zinedine Zidane's side would have been six points behind leaders Barcelona, having played a game more. So, yeah, it was a pretty important goal!\n\n6. Tottenham (+3)\n\nIf anyone still had doubts about Spurs' title credentials before they went to Manchester City on Sunday, they surely don't anymore. Christian Eriksen's late winner earned a 2-1 win and, after five straight league victories, Tottenham now sit second in the Premier League. On Thursday, they earned an importnat away draw vs. Fiorentina in the Europa League.\n\n7. Atletico Madrid (+1)\n\nA week after scoring his 100th goal for the club, Fernando Torres was on target again as Atletico won 1-0 at Getafe. Diego Simeone's side have stuttered a little in recent weeks and will be looking to rediscover top form soon, given their upcoming fixtures include a Champions League trip to PSV Eindhoven and then, three days later, the Madrid derby against Real.\n\n8. Arsenal (new)\n\nThe Gunners reignited their Premier League title hopes thanks to their let show against Leicester but must now maintain their momentum if they are to win silverware this season. Their next three games are against Hull in the FA Cup, before they face Barcelona in the Champions League and then travel to Manchester United in league play.\n\n9. Borussia Dortmund (new)\n\nBVB are unbeaten in all competitions since the winter break. Most recently, Thomas Tuchel's side beat Hannover in the Bundesliga, where they trail leaders Bayern by eight points but have a 13-point advantage over third-placed Leverkusen. Dortmund then beat Porto 2-0 in the Europa League, a competition they are definitely capable of winning.\n\n10. Leicester (-3)\n\nSo close, so close! After taking the lead at Arsenal, Leicester then conceded just once having been reduced to 10 men ... until the final minute of injury time when Marcin Wasilewski's clumsy foul led to the free kick from Danny Welbeck scored the Gunners' winner. Valiant defeats don't earn any points but there was still plenty to suggest Leicester won't go away.\n\nDropping out: Napoli, Benfica.\n\nShaka Hislop played for over 10 years in the Premier League and represented Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup. Watch him on ESPN FC TV!", "Despite Borussia Dortmund securing a two-goal cushion from its first leg tie with Porto, the biggest cheer of the night was for one of its own: Nuri Sahin. The former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder, a title-winner at Dortmund under Jurgen Klopp with more than 200 appearances to his name, was named in the starting lineup for the first time since February 2015 after an injury layoff of 355 days.\n\nHe was given a starting shirt alongside Julian Weigl, the young protege of Sahin who has become a regular in the team since his move from 1860 Munich. The 27-year-old, even when injured, was a role model for Weigl and other young players like US-kid Christian Pulisic. Sahin's return was in fact aided by casualties elsewhere -- Ilkay Gundogan and Roman Weidenfeller have been unwell this week and were left out of the squad.\n\nBorussia Dortmund has developed an intimate relationship with the maligned UEFA club competition, seen as secondary to its big brother, the UEFA Champions League. The Bundesliga club has been competing in the tournament since July 30 when it secured a win over Austrian cracks Wolfsberger AC. Ten games, 27 goals and just two defeats later, the final in Basel, Switzerland is certainly a realistic aim for the side sitting second in Germany's top-flight, with goals from Lukasz Piszczek and Marco Reus sealing a 2-0 home win.\n\nTo some, the Europa League is merely an added distraction in an increasingly demanding football season for the continent's top teams. German teams have a dismal record in the tournament with just two Bundesliga finalists in 18 seasons. But Dortmund isn't here to make up the numbers this time around: to the club's supporters, who have backed the club from financial ruin to the brink of European glory, the romance of success trumps over any potential financial gains, or lack of, in this case.\n\nThe imposing, eye-catching choreography which greeted the teams upon entrance was a rallying cry to its players. \"Complete the collection,\" the banners read. The Europa League, or UEFA Cup in its previous incarnation, is a trophy required to add Dortmund to the pantheon of European greats. Only Chelsea, Juventus, Bayern Munich and Ajax have won all three major UEFA tournaments -- Champions League, UEFA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup (now defunct).\n\nAt his prematch press conference on Wednesday, when asked about the strengths of the Portuguese side, Thomas Tuchel made note of the side's impressive defensive compactness. That was illustrated in the first half, in spite of Porto's defense taking to the field strapped-up, bandaged, and worse for wear after a 2-1 win at rivals Benfica last week.\n\nSpanish defender Ivan Marcano was missing, forcing coach Jose Peseiro to shift Miguel Layun into centerback and pull winger Silvestre Varela back into right fullback. But there was always the experience and nous of goalkeeper Ilker Casillas, the former Real Madrid stopper who boasts the most European appearances for a number one (162).\n\nWith a traditional front-three, Dortmund stretched Porto's defense enough to open up holes in its armor. Henrikh Mkhitaryan glided out to the left-flank, crossing the ball into the mixer with Aubameyang the target, but Bruno Martins Indi was sharp enough to clear over his own crossbar. Three minutes later, Mkhitaryan was involved in Dortmund's opener: he took a short corner to combine with Shinji Kagawa before crossing to Piszczek who headed in at the second attempt.\n\nDortmund's refined passing play allowed the home side to completely dominate proceedings. Tempo and incision were the ingredients required with ball dominance secured, but chances were limited for the hosts following the goal. Marco Reus' free-kick on 21 minutes was over the target, while Kagawa blazed wide on 32 minutes after some excellent interplay among the front-three.\n\nSahin exited on 58 minutes and replaced by Moritz Leitner who has been at Dortmund since 2011. The midfielder, still just 23 despite many writing him off after some failed loan spells, carried an attacking impetus from deep as the home side looked to turn a narrow lead into a comfortable one. Piszczek headed wide on 62 minutes and a minute later, Kagawa passed up a glorious chance after some pinball in the box.\n\nBut eight minutes later, the Japanese midfielder arrowed a pass into Mkhitaryan who cut the ball back to Reus and the forward continued his promising run of performances with a good finish, albeit helped in by a deflection. Porto couldn't manage an away goal in Germany, meaning Dortmund, deserved winners on the night, sit comfortably in the driving seat for the second leg. However, as Bayern Munich's 3-1 loss in Portugal showed last season, this is a squad full of Champions League quality. Tuchel and co. still have some work to do next Thursday at the Estadio Dragao.", "Milan - Juventus can't afford to underestimate Bologna on Friday.\n\nThe Bianconeri beat Napoli last weekend to move top of Serie A but could be forgiven for having one eye on Europe ahead of the resumption of the Champions League next week and Tuesday's visit of Bayern Munich.\n\n\"We'll start thinking of that match Saturday morning,\" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. \"The match against Bayern is not the match of the season, it's obviously important, but there is the return match too.\"\n\nJuventus could be four points ahead for the whole weekend with Napoli hosting AC Milan on Monday.\n\nAllegri insisted \"the strongest line-up will play\" but added that Paulo Dybala is likely to be rested and start on the bench Friday with Simone Zaza and Alvaro Morata up front.\n\n\"We're playing for a piece of the title,\" he said. \"It's a fundamental match, in some ways more important than the one against Napoli, because if we win we'll be four points ahead and we can wait calmly for the result of Napoli-Milan.\"\n\n\"We must get the three points because Napoli won't give us an inch. First the aim was to reach them and go above them, now we must try to distance them.\"\n\nBelow the top two, the race for third and the final Champions League spot is tight, with four teams within six points of each other: Fiorentina, Roma and both Milan teams\n\nInter Milan hosts Sampdoria on Saturday, the day before Fiorentina visits Atalanta and Roma welcomes Palermo.\n\nIt's also the Verona derby on Saturday while on Sunday it's: Genoa vs. Udinese; Sassuolo vs. Empoli; Torino vs. Carpi; and Frosinone vs. Lazio.\n\nSome things to know about Serie A entering this weekend's matches:\n\nIt is a transformed team since Roberto Donadoni took over, climbing up from the bottom to 10th spot and beating Napoli, Milan and Sampdoria on the way.\n\nIt faces its toughest test, against a Juve team that has 15 consecutive victories, and needs just two more to match the Serie A record of 17 established by Inter in 2006-07.\n\n\"Juve will be keen to continue their hot run of form but the same goes for us,\" Donadoni said.\n\nTHE SPECIAL ONE\n\nThere could be two very special guests at San Siro on Saturday.\n\nJose Mourinho is meeting former Inter President Massimo Moratti for lunch in Milan and will then return to San Siro for the first time since leaving the Nerazzurri in 2010 after winning the treble of the Serie A title, Italian Cup and Champions League.\n\n\"He made history at Inter and his presence will strengthen the club even more,\" Moratti told the Italian national news agency ANSA.\n\nFormer Inter Milan forward Ronaldo is also in Italy and reportedly considering going to Saturday's match.\n\nRonaldo spent five years at Inter before moving to Real Madrid in 2002, shortly after winning a second World Cup with Brazil.\n\nMISSING PLAYERS\n\nOne player who won't be on the pitch at San Siro is Inter Milan midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia.\n\nThe France international was handed a two-match ban in Serie A for a red card after the final whistle against Fiorentina for applauding the referee.\n\nThat match saw two other players sent off: Kondogbia's teammate Alex Telles for two yellow cards and Fiorentina forward Mauro Zarate, banned for three matches for putting his hands around Jeison Murillo's neck.\n\nInter and Fiorentina are appealing Kondogbia's and Zarate's bans.\n\nInter, which lost the match 2-1, refused to speak to the media after the match and the team went into a training camp from Wednesday until Saturday's match.", "Three observations on Manchester United's dismal 2-1 Europa League Round of 32 first leg defeat to Denmark's FC Midtjylland.\n\n1. A nadir for Van Gaal\n\nThe Europa League was supposed to be beneath a club of Manchester United's stature. They should not have been visiting a modest club, formed in 1999, from a Danish town with a capacity of under 12,000. They belonged in grander surroundings.\n\nThe reality is very different. This is a nadir for manager Louis van Gaal's dismal reign. Thursday's match was supposed to be the road to redemption, a drive towards the more prosperous Champions League. United should have been targeting a Europa League title. Instead, they have hit a bump, created by themselves, right at the start line. The pressure, already high, has been cranked right up.\n\nThere were errors aplenty. Not just for the goals conceded themselves, but in general play too. The Midtjylland strikes were awful viewing for United though. There was the careless surrendering of possession by Michael Carrick that led to the home team's equaliser, compounded by the failure to snuff out the danger by Ander Herrera, then a feeble attempt by Juan Mata to keep out the winning goal.\n\nVan Gaal has used injuries a lot as an excuse this season and, fair enough, there was no Wayne Rooney here or David De Gea, after the goalkeeper sustained an injury in the pre-match warm-up. But those are no excuses for what was seen in Denmark in the closing stages -- or even before.\n\nIn fact, back-up goalkeeper Sergio Romero was a key man in stopping United from being embarrassed sooner. It has been such a familiar sight to see the Spaniard make crucial, impressive saves and Romero carried on that pattern.\n\nThere were two critical blocks from the Argentinian when the score was 0-0. First, he made an agile stop, diving low to his left to keep out a header inside the six-yard box from Kian Hansen. Then Romero saved a one-on-one from Vaclav Kadlec, with the goalkeeper sticking his left leg out -- and less than a minute later, United would go ahead through Memphis Depay in the 37th minute.\n\nDisappointingly for United, that was a lead which they surrendered right before half-time with Pione Sisto beating Romero. At 1-1, the Argentina international made perhaps the best save of the bunch just after the hour mark. He flung out his left hand to push a powerful, close-range header from Paul Onuachu over the bar. De Gea would have approved.\n\nIt was not enough though. United had not done enough in the final third and they were punished by falling behind. This performance continues their regrettable away form in Europe.\n\nFC Midtjylland being formed in 1999 brings back memories of United beating Bayern Munich in that year's Champions League final and celebrations in the Nou Camp. Such illustrious opponents and venues looked further away from United than ever on this night.\n\nThe Europa League is serious business for United these days. Even in this competition, though, they have fallen in defeat. And they deserved it.\n\n2. Smalling struggles\n\nThe concern for United had been a makeshift defence, but it was the midfield who caused them their most damaging problems. Nothing that Van Gaal did could change that. Morgan Schneiderlin was brought on to try to restore some order for the final 20 minutes, but he lost the ball carelessly soon after his arrival, summarising the night.\n\nUnited's full-back curse had been striking again in the build-up to this match, with Matteo Darmian and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson both being ruled out, so it was encouraging how Donald Love and Daley Blind approached their task as the replacements, and it was a shame that the midfield did not offer more.\n\nLove was making his first start for United, and the 21-year-old right-back was not afraid of going forward, while Blind was also a useful attacking outlet on occasions. Blind certainly deserves credit for continuing to show his adaptability and reliability. His move to the left side meant that Paddy McNair came into central defence.\n\nWith that lineup in place, it looked like Chris Smalling, who had impressed so often this season, would need to be a leader. Although Smalling had played on the Midtjylland turf before, while on England under 21 duty, he did not look at home, however.\n\nThere was one sloppy early header from Smalling, that conceded a corner, and at the other end, he wasted a headed chance from a corner midway through the first half. It was not his night and that unsettles those around him.\n\nRooney void felt\n\nWatching Depay can leave you feeling abnormally frustrated. At times, there's the excitement generated by some of his marauding runs. At others, it's exasperating when he then makes the wrong decision at the end of said run.\n\nWayne Rooney's absence through injury meant that it was time for Depay and Martial to step up in this match and the results were not pretty viewing for United. With Depay, there is a sense that he is still raw in certain scenarios and is very much a confidence player. It is a contrast to Rooney, who is very much a leader as well as someone who can score regularly.\n\nThis was Depay's first start since Boxing Day and Rooney's absence means there should be plenty more to come -- and it is down to Depay whether he sinks or swims. The promise is there, but he needs to make it count.\n\nThe former PSV Eindhoven player's mindset should have been helped when he embarked on a long run without being stopped in the second minute. His performance soon seemed to be wobbling, however, as he failed to capitalise on an early opening, then soon afterwards lost possession cheaply. Thankfully for him, he scored eight minutes before the break, finishing well after slipping, but he was mostly anonymous in the second half.\n\nMartial, meanwhile, showed some good early footwork and smart decision-making, but he was also inconsistent. He had a penalty appeal after a decent run, but there was also a poor miss.\n\nMartial was switched to the left hand side early in the second half and almost created a chance with a piercing run, but the chance was not taken by Jesse Lingard. Like Depay, the Frenchman would go on to have a quiet 45 minutes.\n\nOverall, United got very little from their two playmakers.\n\nArindam is ESPN FC's Manchester United correspondent.

Would a Europa League-winning Manchester United miss out? Would England have six sides in the Champions League?\n\nThe answer is no, and that would be bad news for the side finishing fourth in the Premier League. The number of Champions League sides from a single country is capped at five and wins in the continental competitions take precedence over fourth spot in the domestic league.\n\nSo should Chelsea (or Manchester City should they slip further in the table) lift the European Cup and Manchester United or Liverpool (or, potentially, Tottenham should they suffer a horrendous late-season collapse in league form) lift the Uefa Cup but finish outside the top four in the Premier League, then the team finishing fourth would qualify instead for the Europa League.\n\nWith the Premier League finishing on 15 May and the Champions League final not until 28 May, it raises the tantalising prospect of Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich needing to beat Chelsea in the final in order to secure his new team's place in the competition for 2016-17.

World Cup winner Zidane won the competition as a player with Real in 2002 and as assistant to former Carlo Ancelotti when the 'Galacticos' claimed their record 10th European Cup or 'Decima' in 2014. On the night he made his debut as a head coach in the competition, the Frenchman who ended his career by being sent off for headbutting Italian Marco Materazzi in the final of the 2006 World Cup, was left rejoicing with his players on the touchlines as they underlined their status as co-favourites alongside Bayern Munich and holders Barcelona. After weathering a frustrating first half in which an inspired Roma side failed to finish off a series of promising attacks, Cristiano Ronaldo broke the deadlock on 57 minutes when he ran on to Marcelo's chip to beat Wojciech Szczesny with a shot that deflected off right-back Alessandro Florenzi. It was the Portuguese forward's 12th goal in seven Champions League games this term and lifted huge pressure off the shoulders off Zidane. \"Everyone expects Ronaldo to score, and he fulfilled expectations,\" said Zidane. To their credit, Roma dug deep in a bid to claim a share of the spoils and were unlucky not to earn a penalty when Florenzi went down under the studs-up challenge of Dani Carvajal. Even after that decision, the hosts battled throughout a dominant late spell inspired by Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, only to come up short. It was inspiring stuff, but dozens of the 55,612 home crowd began leaving their seats five minutes from the finish when Jese flashed a shot across several defenders to beat Szczesny low at his far post. The victory gives Real a huge advantage ahead of the return leg at their Santiago Bernabeu home in three weeks time. But Zidane, who replaced sacked Rafael Benitez last month, said there is a long way to go until the May 28 final in Milan. \"May 28 is still a long way off. We still have to think about the second leg and take it one game at a time,\" he told media after the game. Despite statistics suggesting Real have a 100 percent chance to go through to the last eight after a 2-0 first leg win, Zidane added: \"Statistics don't count, especially when there's still another 90 minutes to play.\" As Zidane rejoiced, Roma handler Luciano Spalletti was left wishing he could have turned back time. The Italian was in charge at Roma in 2008 when the Giallorossi beat Real 2-1 twice in succession in the last 16 on their way to a quarter-final defeat to Manchester United. But despite dominating for long spells, Roma ultimately came up short in the final third of the pitch. Spalletti hit the nail on the head when he said: \"You give a player like Ronaldo an inch, and he takes a mile.\" He added: \"The difference is in the fact that when you give players of Real's quality an opening, they seize on it. We just didn't put our chances away, and that's the thing I'm most sorry about.\" The 50,000-plus crowd was a huge improvement on Roma's usual attendances which have been hit by fans staying away to protest at new stringent security measures. \"Their applause (at the final whistle) was fundamental for us, because it means we've played well,\" added Spalletti. \"Our fans, who have seen great players at this club like Falcao, (Gabriel) Batistuta and (Francesco) Totti, know when they see good football.\" The odds are heavily against Roma, however, when they visit to the Spanish capital in a fortnight. \"The difference between us and them is that they reaped the biggest rewards with a minimum of work,\" said midfielder Radja Nainggolan. \"We played well and didn't make too many errors, but we go to Madrid knowing that it will be difficult to qualify.\"", "GERMANY: A 'human error with disastrous consequences' led to the fatal train crash near Bad Aibling on February 9, Bayern's state prosecutor Wolfgang Giese has confirmed. Killing 11 people and injured another 80, the head-on collision between two Flirt EMUs on a single-track line was the worst railway accident in Bayern for more than 20 years.\n\nAt around 06.45, the three-car Meridian train 79506 from Rosenheim to Holzkirchen collided with its six-car eastbound counterpart 79505 on a curved section of line in a wooded area. Information recovered from the data recorders showed that one train was running close to the line speed of 100 km/h and the other at more than 50 km/h. There was little evidence of braking, suggesting that the drivers may not have seen the other train until the last moment. Despite being built to the latest crashworthiness standards, both leading cars were virtually destroyed.\n\nEquipped with colourlight signals and PZB automatic train protection, the Mangfalltalbahn is controlled by DB Netz from a relay signalbox at Bad Aibling. Passenger services are operated by Transdev subsidiary Bayrische Oberland Bahn under the Meridian brand.\n\nBOB said one train had a trainee driver and an instructor in the cab, while the other driver had been accompanied by a colleague from another operator; at least three of them were among the fatalities.\n\nThe two trains had been timetabled to pass at Kolbermoor, but it is understood that train 79505 was running late. While the exact sequence of events is still being determined, the prosecutors said there was 'no evidence of a technical failure', but that 'a special signal was activated that shouldn't have been'. Reports indicate that one of the trains may have been authorised to pass two red signals using a subsidiary 'Ersatz' aspect, which is provided to authorise trains to proceed at restricted speed in the event of a technical failure.\n\nGiese confirmed on February 16 that 'had the dispatcher acted in accordance with the rules, as bound by his duty, the accident would not have happened'. Prosecutor J\u00fcrgen Branz added that the dispatcher had realised his mistake and issued a distress call, but this was not heeded. The prosecutors have opened an involuntary manslaughter investigation.", "George Graham once described a goalkeeper as \"the jewel in the crown\" of any successful football team.\n\nThe ex-Arsenal manager said it was \"the biggest sin in football\" to make a goalkeeper do any work, and that getting at him should be \"almost impossible\".\n\nA utopian view, perhaps, but he surely has a point. Without a good goalkeeper, teams tend to fall short of their objective.\n\n\"A good goalkeeper is as valuable as a striker that's going to score 20 to 25 goals a season,\" former Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic told BBC Sport in 2010.\n\n\"When I first started playing (in 1978) there was not a great deal of importance placed on keepers, but Brian Clough was the instigator of the goalkeeper being an important part of the team when he bought Peter Shilton for Nottingham Forest (in 1977).\n\n\"He went on to be proved right when they won European Cups and championships.\"\n\nBut do goalkeepers get the credit they deserve? Russian great Lev Yashin remains the only goalkeeper to have won the Ballon d'Or, while in England, Shilton is the only goalkeeper to hav won the PFA Player of the Year award.\n\nOnly one goalkeeper features in the 100 most expensive transfers of all time - Gianluigi Buffon way back in 2001.\n\nIt is therefore refreshing to see a goalkeeper have a 'worldie', or as some Boro fans now call it, 'having a Simon Eastwood'.\n\nThere's something hugely satisfying in seeing a team thwarted by the very last line of defence, a goalkeeper on a one-man mission to preserve his clean sheet.\n\nTalking of goalkeepers, it's not been a bad campaign so far for Dimi Konstantopoulos, has it?\n\nHaving conceded only 16 goals in 30 league games to date, the Greek stopper is on course to become the most successful goalkeeper in more than 100 Boro campaigns.\n\nDimi has kept 17 clean sheets already this season, four more than Bayern Munich No 1 Manuel Neuer and five more than Arsenal stopper Petr Cech.\n\nHe was part of the record-breaking Boro rearguard who racked up nine consecutive league clean sheets, smashing a 30-year club milestone.\n\nIt's been an incredible campaign for the 37-year-old, who began the 2013/14 season as Boro's third-choice stopper. He's now the undisputed No 1 after a sizzling year.\n\nRead more 'Is Dimi Boro's best ever keeper?'\n\nThe old cliche is that a good goalkeeper 'can save a team more than 10 points every season'.\n\nSo on the way back from Elland Road on Monday night, that got me thinking. Surely Dimi is fast-approaching that tally?\n\nLooking at the coveted Gazette three***, two**, one* stars dished out after every match this season, Dimi is third in the Boro standings this season.\n\nHe has been given 21 stars this campaign, with only Daniel Ayala (26) and Adam Clayton (25) having picked up more.\n\nOf course, awarding a man of the match is a matter of opinion.\n\nBut it's an interesting guide to look at how influential Dimi has been, and how many points he has potentially saved Boro this season.\n\nIt's not conclusive, and of course, a goalkeeper is helped by the strength of the defence in front of them. But you'd still struggle to find many Boro fans who feel Dimi hasn't earned his stripes this season.\n\nSo below is a list of every match during which Dimi has been awarded a star. How many points do you think he has saved Boro this season?\n\nAugust 18 Derby (a) - 1 star - DRAW\n\nAfter Kike Garcia opened the scoring for Boro in the first half, Aitor Karanka's side faced a second-half barrage from the Rams at the iPro Stadium.\n\nDimi played his part in keeping Boro in front - reacting quickly to palm Tom Ince's dangerous free-kick around the post, before making a point-blank stop to deny Chris Martin late on.\n\nIn the end, Boro's goal was breached as Johnny Russell hammered home on 88 minutes.\n\nAugust 22 Bristol City (h) - three stars - DEFEAT\n\nIt might have ended in a narrow defeat, but Dimi followed up his impressive display against Derby with a man of the match display at the Riverside.\n\nThe Greek goalkeeper pulled off two memorable first-half saves to deny Aaron Wilbraham and Jonathan Kodjia, the latter's effort looking destined for the top corner from 25 yards.\n\nSeptember 19 Nottingham Forest (a) - two stars - WON\n\nVery unfortunate not to claim all three stars, Dimi was back to his best as Boro ended a 16-year curse to clinch all three points at The City Ground.\n\nWith the score locked at 1-1, Dimi made a crucial save from the spot to deny Henri Lansbury's second-half penalty, but also made four or five big interventions to help Boro see the game out.\n\nBoro's No 1 twice was sent sprawling to deny Eric Lichaj, and held firm despite a late Forest onslaught.\n\nOctober 17 Fulham (h) - one star - DRAW\n\nBoro huffed and puffed but couldn't break down Fulham's door at the Riverside as it ended goalless.\n\nKaranka's men dominated for large periods, and although the Greek goalie had almost nothing to do, Dimi did make a stunning one-hand save to deny Ross McCormack a certain winner.\n\nOctober 20 Cardiff (a) - one star - LOST\n\nIt was last-gasp heartbreak for Boro as George Friend's cruel own goal extended the team's winless run to three matches.\n\nDimi could do little to stop that late setback, but did make crucial saves from Peter Whittingham, Craig Noone and Matthew Connolly beforehand.\n\nOctober 24 Wolves (a) - two stars - WON\n\nArguably the turning point in Boro's season, with Karanka's men on the brink of self-implosion and staring down the barrel at Molineux.\n\nStewart Downing - a surprise omission from the starting XI - came off the bench to inspire Boro to all three points, after Diego Fabbrini's speculative effort crept into the corner to draw level.\n\nBut it's easy to forget that Dimi made a critical, point-blank save from James Henry to deny Wolves a second goal in the 67 minute. At that stage of the game, Wolves were 1-0 up and in total control.\n\nNovember 20 QPR (h) - one star - WON\n\nIt was last-gasp delight for Boro as Grant Leadbitter stroked home a stoppage time penalty to clinch all three points, but QPR provided plenty of scares in the second half to keep Dimi on his toes.\n\nAfter dominating the first half, Boro were caught off guard in the second as the recently-relegated R's carved out a host of openings, with Dimi saving from Alejandro Faurlin, Yun Suk-Young and twice from Matty Phillips.\n\nLeadbitter grabbed the headlines, but Dimi kept Boro in the match during a tough second half period.\n\nNovember 28 Huddersfield (a) - two stars, WON\n\nTo say it was a 'smash and grab' may be a little harsh, but Boro certainly weren't at their best despite running out 2-0 winners.\n\nAdam Clayton and Emilio Nsue got the goals, but the sound of Boro fans singing \"Two shots, we've only had two shots\" at the final whistle told a story.\n\nOn the day, Dimi had to deal with almost impossible conditions at the John Smith's Stadium, with swirling wind and lashing rain making it a goalkeeper's nightmare.\n\nBut Boro's No 1 made two vital saves in the first half when the score was one-nil, getting down low to deny Nakhi Wells and Jamie Paterson. A match-winning intervention.\n\nDecember 4 Ipswich Town (a) - three stars - WON\n\nIt may be uncommon to hand the Man of the Match award to a goalkeeper in a 2-0 victory, but Dimi Konstantopolous made three crucial saves to give Boro the platform to win.\n\nHis first-half stop to deny Brett Pitman was fairly routine, but he had to be alert to prevent Luke Chambers from stabbing home at the back post before the break.\n\nBut his best came when Dani Ayala misjudged the flight of the ball and Pitman was lurking at the back post, pulling off an incredible save to safeguard Boro's clean sheet. A colossus under the high ball, and made crucial saves.\n\nJanuary 12 Brentford (a) - two stars - WON\n\nBoro moved six points clear at the top of the Championship after edging another tight tussle at Griffin Park.\n\nThe result was built on brave defending and good goalkeeping, meaning Daniel Ayala's effort on the hour mark was enough to secure maximum points.\n\nBoro needed Dimi in west London, and he was there. He made several critical saves as Brentford threatened to score the all-important opener, including a vital stop to deny Lasse Vibe.\n\nA vital contribution from the team's often unsung hero.\n\nFebruary 15 Leeds (a) - three stars - DREW\n\nIn Boro's last match, Dimi put on another superb display to keep his side level at Elland Road.\n\nHe showed great powers of concentration to stay alert, making an incredible low save to deny Souleymane Doukara's header in the second half - later described as \"one of the best\" that Leeds boss Steve Evans has ever seen.\n\nDimi also denied Doukara in added time as Boro were rocking following the late dismissal of Ben Gibson.\n\nIt's fair to say without his contribution, Boro would have lost.\n\nPoll loading ...", "ROME: Zinedine Zidane won't admit it yet, but 10-time winners Real Madrid remain on course for a sixth consecutive Champions League semifinal appearance after a clinical 2-0 win at Roma in the first leg of their last 16 tie on Wednesday.\n\nWorld Cup winner Zidane won the competition as a player with Real in 2002 and as assistant to former Carlo Ancelotti when the 'Galacticos' claimed their record 10th European Cup or 'Decima' in 2014.\n\nOn the night he made his debut as a head coach in the competition, the Frenchman who ended his career by being sent off for headbutting Italian Marco Materazzi in the final of the 2006 World Cup, was left rejoicing with his players on the touchlines as they underlined their status as co-favorites alongside Bayern Munich and holders Barcelona.\n\nAfter weathering a frustrating first half in which an inspired Roma side failed to finish off a series of promising attacks, Cristiano Ronaldo broke the deadlock on 57 minutes when he ran on to Marcelo's chip to beat Wojciech Szczesny with a shot that deflected off right-back Alessandro Florenzi.\n\nIt was the Portuguese forward's 12th goal in seven Champions League games this term and lifted huge pressure off the shoulders off Zidane.\n\n\"Everyone expects Ronaldo to score, and he fulfilled expectations,\" said Zidane.\n\nTo their credit, Roma dug deep in a bid to claim a share of the spoils and were unlucky not to earn a penalty when Florenzi went down under the studs-up challenge of Dani Carvajal.\n\nEven after that decision, the hosts battled throughout a dominant late spell inspired by Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, only to come up short.\n\nIt was inspiring stuff, but dozens of the 55,612 home crowd began leaving their seats five minutes from the finish when Jese flashed a shot across several defenders to beat Szczesny low at his far post.\n\nThe victory gives Real a huge advantage ahead of the return leg at their Santiago Bernabeu home in three weeks time.\n\nBut Zidane, who replaced sacked Rafael Benitez last month, said there is a long way to go until the May 28 final in Milan.\n\n\"May 28 is still a long way off.

Currently, 84% of MSSL's revenues come from overseas with Germany being the biggest contributor. The company aims to get 30% of its revenue from Americas alone in the next 5 years.\n\nLuxemburg headquartered IAC is a global auto-industry supplier that last year generated almost $6 billion in annual revenues selling instrument panels, cockpits, doors and trim, headliners and other exterior components from its 85 manufacturing facilities spread across 20 countries.\n\nIAC had failed to launch a planned $115 million initial public offering in 2011 and delayed it again in 2013 during market turmoil in Europe. The supplier planned to re-launch the IPO last year, but never followed through. Last August, the company also saw the appointment of auto parts turnaround specialist Robert \"Steve\" Miller, as its new CEO, who came on board after reorganizing Delphi Corp. Most saw this development as part of a new strategy by Ross to find a partner to revive the operations or monetise his investments. Subsequently, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Jeffries were mandated to initiate a formal sale process late last year.\n\nMSSL is said to have pipped several global suitors and private equity buyout funds to emerge as the final contender, added the sources mentioned above on condition of anonymity as the talks are still in private domain. One of the sources even added, that both parties are now engaged in exclusive negotiations. However this could not be verified independently. MSSL is also believed to be parallely pursuing one more international target.\n\nSources add, Motherson is likely to use its Netherlands-based European arm -- Samvardhana Motherson Automotive Systems Group B.V. (SMRP BV) -- for this acquisition which was also used in previous acquisitions of Peguform and the rear view mirror business of Visiocorp plc UK.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, in FY15, MSSL has Rs 1891 crore of cash in its books and net debt of Rs 5130 crore. Its current market cap is Rs 29,523.23 crore.\n\nMSSL spokesperson declined to comment on market speculation. Mails sent to spokesperspons of IAC and Wilbur Ross & Co did not generate a response till the time of going to press.\n\nBUYOUT MACHINE IAC was formed in 2006 when. Ross's private-equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. LLC and investment fund manager Franklin Mutual Advisers LLC merged the interiors business of Lear Corp. with Collins & Aikman Corp. The company grew from there as Ross bought other parts makers globally. Similar to Motherson's strategy of inorganic growth via acquisitions, IAC too has been a consolidator in the interiors segment with a total of 17 buyouts since inception. It made its last acquisition in July 2013, when it took a stake in South African joint venture IAC-Feltex (Pty) Ltd., a maker of automotive flooring, acoustics and trim components. However, its shrinking margins have been a consistent worry. Analysts familiar with the ongoing discussions say, compared to its peers IACs margins are 50% less which gives opportunity to a player like MSSL to maximise value and achieve significant EBITDA upside.\n\nDespite the short term volatility around the stock on lower revenue and margin growth in the December quarter - down 7.75% in the last 1 month as against a 3.35% decline of the benchmark Sensex -- MSSL has witnessed phenomenal growth in the last 15 years with revenues and profits growing at a 44% and 35% CAGR respectively through a mix of greenfield projects and buyouts - about a dozen in as many years - and successfully turning them around. After clocking its $5 billion revenue target for 2015, Sehgal has already created the next 5 year blueprint for the entire group that talks of $18 billion in revenues with an ROCE of 40%. While $12 billion is expected from organic growth, the rest is expected from M&As.\n\n\"44% of Motherson's revenues are linked to Volkswagen Group and the market has punished the stock this year after the auto major was caught in the emission software scandal. So diversifying its multinational OEM base through big bets like IAC will help the company,\" said a Mumbai based FII analyst who did not wish to get quoted.\n\nTo derisk the business, the company is already following its stated 3C X 15 strategy wherein no single customer, country or component should constitute more than 15% of total turnover. By 2020, the management is confident of reaching near 3CX10. Last year the company also bagged biggest order from Daimler worth approximately Rs 15400 crores, supply for which is expected to start in 2018. To support the Daimler's expansion, MSSL has already invested in 2 new plants, one each in USA and Hungary, along with brownfield capacity expansion in in Germany. A lion's share of the company's fresh capex is going to be in Americas.\n\n\"We estimate MSSL's consolidated earnings to witness 32% CAGR over FY15-18E, supported by 16% CAGR in revenues and 250 bps margin improvements,\" wrote analysts from JM Financial in their Febriary 10th report. \"We believe MSS offers robust revenue visibility with strong order-book of EUR 12.5bn+ and growing continuously. Further, capacity expansion would drive market share gains, especially in BMW and Daimler, diversifying revenues,\" added Jay Kale, analyst at Elara Capital in his February brokerage report.\n\nInteriors in recent times seen mega deals as some corporations choose to get out of the space while others are filing gaps in their lineup and saving on significant development costs.

XVIII fighter warbird in Angelholm, Sweden\n\nOn arrival, it will be driven, slowly and carefully, along icy highways 470 miles to GLACIER - the Global Aerospace Centre for Icing and Environmental Research - at Thompson, Manitoba, where it will undergo extreme cold weather testing.\n\nThe XWB, which powers passenger jumbo jets, is a genuine marvel of British manufacturing, made by our flagship industrial company, Rolls-Royce.\n\nUnfortunately, the technical prowess that has made the Rolls-Royce name famous throughout the world has not always been matched by managerial skill.\n\nThe sheer brilliance of the XWB is starkly at odds with the company's nose-diving profits and share price. Despite hopeful results earlier this month, the FTSE 100 firm still faces its biggest financial crisis since the early Seventies.\n\nRolls-Royce went bankrupt 45 years ago due to the burgeoning costs of developing the RB211, the forerunner of the XWB.\n\nShortly after, the company was nationalised by Ted Heath's Tory government.\n\nThe country reacted as if Britain itself had gone bust, asking how it could happen to the maker of the Merlin engines that powered the Spitfire (pictured above) and saved the nation from the Luftwaffe, not to mention the country's most coveted make of car.\n\nThe Britain of today is a very different place and the outlook for Rolls is not as bleak now as it was then - but the future is beset with uncertainty.\n\nRolls is not on the brink: it has a \u00a373billion order book and has commandeered more than half of the global market for engines for larger 'wide-bodied' jumbo jets.\n\nBut long-term investors have taken flight and at least one US hedge fund has bought a stake. The Government has looked at emergency plans including part-nationalisation and a rescue merger.\n\nFiring up the engines: An XWB under production by Rolls-Royce workers in Derby\n\nSuch drastic measures are unlikely, but the fact they have been on the radar shows the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThe company traces its roots to 1904, when Charles Rolls met Henry Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester.\n\nThe pair set up in business, producing the Silver Ghost car two years later and an aero-engine, the Eagle, at the start of World War One. As well as making the Merlin engine for the Spitfire, Rolls developed the Welland engine for the Gloster Meteor fighter in 1944.\n\nThe rights to the use of the name and marque on the cars were sold to BMW of Germany in 1998, leaving the British firm to concentrate on aero-engines. It also has a marine division and an energy arm.\n\nShenanigans at the banks, and retailers such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer, have dominated the City pages, while Rolls-Royce's woes have attracted relatively little attention. But its fortunes should concern every Briton.\n\nIt employs more than 21,000 people in the UK and is responsible for \u00a36 of every \u00a31,000 of national income, and \u00a31 in every \u00a350 of UK exports.\n\nEqually important is the tug of pride at the mention of the name Rolls-Royce, a byword for British excellence.\n\nThe extent of its travails has gradually been coming to light over the past two years, with thousands of job losses, and profit forecasts cut five times.\n\nAnd there's the small matter of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribery and corruption overseas.\n\nThe company is pinning its hopes on new boss, Warren East, who took the top job in July. The 54-year-old engineer, comes with a stellar reputation earned at British smartphone chip-maker ARM.\n\n'The general perception is that he is a serious operator, he eats nails for breakfast and is tough as teak,' says City commentator David Buik.\n\nFaith: The company is pinning its hopes on new boss, Warren East, who took the top job in July\n\nEast, however, has admitted he cannot guarantee the flood of bad news will dry up any time soon, because the business is shrouded in what he calls 'accountancy fog'.\n\nWhen he took the helm, he was stunned to find the company is riddled with inefficiency and bureaucracy.\n\nUnder predecessors Sir John Rose and John Rishton, it appeared to be a tremendous success but behind the scenes, red tape was burgeoning and arrogance was taking hold.\n\nShares rose last week when it unveiled its full-year results despite a stinging dividend cut and profits at the low end of expectations - on the basis it could have been worse.\n\nIn Whitehall the company is being watched like a hawk.\n\n'The Government cannot be a casual bystander here' said one senior industry insider.\n\nOne of the options under consideration if the situation gets worse is for the state to take control of the company's nuclear submarine business.\n\nAnother is a 'rescue merger', with the defence giant BAE Systems taking over all or part of the business. Neither option is likely unless the problems at Rolls become worse. The fact these possibilities have been discussed at all, however, underlines the company's crucial role in ensuring our national security.\n\nRolls is protected from foreign predators by a golden share agreement struck when it was privatised in 1987, under which the Government holds one special share, but it has been targeted by so-called 'activist' shareholders.\n\nSan Francisco hedge fund ValueAct last year built a 10 per cent holding. Now the single biggest investor, it is clamouring for a seat on the board and there are fears it could encourage Rolls to break itself up.\n\nSome of the company's most loyal long-term supporters have been jettisoning their shares, including Neil Woodford, who sold a \u00a3230million holding late last year saying his confidence in Rolls' business model had been 'shaken'.\n\nBack in Derby, however, Simon Burr, director of the Trent XWB programme, insists the profit warnings and talk of a merger have 'no effect at all', on the engineering.\n\n'We are sensitive to the fact that investors are key stakeholders and they need a return. Customers are confident in us.'\n\nHigh stakes: Rolls-Royce employs more than 21,000 people in the UK and is responsible for \u00a36 of every \u00a31,000 of national income, and \u00a31 in every \u00a350 of UK exports\n\nIndeed, walking the polished factory floors you feel this is the epitome of 21st-century manufacturing. Head of production for the XWB engine, Tanya Palmer, says: 'It is the most successful engine we have ever built. There were more than 1,500 orders before aircraft went into service.'\n\nUp close, the XWB is a thing of beauty and an engineering marvel. It boasts 68 turbine blades, each generating 800 horsepower at take-off, equivalent to a Formula One racing car.\n\nInside the turbine, temperatures can exceed 2,000C, so to prevent them melting each blade has tiny holes drilled in order that 'cool air' - at 700C! - can be blown through. The blades need the strength to cope with a force at take-off equal to nine London buses hanging off each one.\n\nIn No 58 test bed, an engine is being pelted with dead birds and hail. But in the control room, just a few metres away, the sound-proofing is so effective there is barely a murmur.\n\nThe Derby plant has its own railway station to take delivery of more than 20million litres of jet fuel a year, and has its own 20-strong fire brigade.\n\nAerospace analyst Howard Wheeldon says of Rolls: 'Their profit margins are too low, they have allowed top-level management to get too large, and they need to cut costs. But they are addressing that.'\n\nRolls-Royce is not just any old business, but the beating heart of British engineering.\n\nAerospace is one of the few fields where this country still excels, and for all our sakes the company needs leadership and political support to match its superlative engineering.\n\nThe engines of growth must be fired up again at Rolls, because the alternative is too awful to contemplate.\n\nPoliticians, and the firm's management, cannot afford even the slightest risk that the nightmare of the Seventies could ever be repeated.", "One of the suspected robbers in the Koala robbery incident has been released from the Police Hospital and taken into police custody.\n\nStanley Obaliko, alias Sully Mohammed, 35, a Nigerian resident in Ghana, and another suspect, Okoe Quarcoe, 30, unemployed, sustained injuries when they attempted to rob a Marketing Administrator of Koala Shopping Centre on January 9, 2016 in Accra.\n\nA taxi driver who chanced on the incident chased the two suspects who were on a motorcycle with his vehicle and knocked them off their motorbike into a gutter. The two have since been on admission at the Police Hospital under police guard.\n\nLast Friday, the hospital administration discharged Obaliko and he is currently in the custody of the Accra Regional Police. He is being prepared for court.\n\nPolice confirmation\n\nThe Accra Regional Police Command Public Relations Officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Afia Tenge, who confirmed this to the Daily Graphic, debunked speculations that one of the suspects had escaped from police custody.\n\nShe stated that Quarcoe was still on admission at the Police Hospital and under guard. Three accomplices: Michael Edoe Ahiataku, an ex-soldier; Gilbert Osabutey, a shop supervisor at Koala Shopping Centre, and Frederick Sedro Kwame, a private security guard with Acasia Building Company, who were arrested in connection with the case, have been put before court.\n\nThe three who pleaded not guilty to the charges of conspiracy to commit crime, possession of firearm and ammunition without authority, robbery and causing harm have since been remanded in police custody. Two other persons who are at large are being hunted by the police.\n\nFacts of the case\n\nAccording to the facts of the case which were presented in court on January 6, three of the accused, Ahiataku, Osabutey and Kwame, hatched a plan to rob the Koala Shopping Centre, and sought the assistance of two accomplices now at large, who also recruited Obaliko and Quarcoe to carry out the plot.\n\n.\n\nOn January 8, at about 8 p.m., all the accused persons met at the Koala Shopping Centre at Cantonments, and Osabutey, the shop supervisor, briefed them on the movements of the Marketing Administrator of Koala Shopping Centre, Ms Lydia Horsu, who goes round daily to collect money from sales and later sends it to the company's head office at the Airport residential. They planned to rob her the following day.\n\nOn January 9, at about 8 a.m., Ms Horsu went to the Cantonments branch, and decided to just audit the company's invoices and vouchers and left, en route to the head office.\n\nOsabutey, who was at the shop, alerted Ahiataku and Kwame, via mobile phone, as well as Obaliko and Quarcoe, who were riding a blue BMW motorbike close by, that the complainant had left.\n\nTaxi driver\n\nObaliko and Quarcoe are said to have trailed the complainant to a section of the road near the American Embassy at Cantonments, and Obaliko, who was the pillion rider, alighted, pointed a pistol at Ms Horsu and ordered her to surrender her handbag.\n\nLydia is said to have initially refused to comply and raised an alarm which infuriated Obaliko, who pushed her to the ground and forcibly snatched the handbag from her. Thereafter, Obaliko shot her twice in her left thigh and calf, after which he and Quarcoe sped off on their motorbike.\n\nA taxi driver who witnessed the incident chased them with his vehicle and knocked them off their motorbike into a gutter.\n\nSubsequently, a report was made to the police, leading to the arrest of Obaliko and Quarcoe. The taxi driver, who was hailed for his heroic act, has since been honoured by the management of Koala Shopping Centre and the state.", "Rahul Kalvapalle Superstar The BMW M760Li xDrive Luxury Sedan Offers Racecar-Quality Specs By: Rahul Kalvapalle - Published: Feb 17, 2016 * References: press.bmwgroup & gizmag The BMW M760Li xDrive is a long wheelbase luxury sedan that is the BMW M series' answer to the Alpina B7 Biturbo addition to the venerable BMW 7 Series.\n\nThis particular vehicle is equipped with a powerful 6.6-liter twin turbo V12 engine that is capable of pumping out 600 horsepower at 5,500 revs per minute as well as an impressive 590 pounds-feet of torque.

But no one said it had to be obscene too. It's obscene because the investors who will benefit most from the government-sponsored bailout programs - some in place, some to come - are the Bombardier and Beaudoin family members who remain in control of the company in spite of their epic management sins.\n\nThis is called rewarding bad behaviour, the equivalent of handing a BMW to your reckless son after he drove the Buick into a wall.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bombardier's new passenger jet, the C Series, scored a rare victory when Air Canada dropped its long aversion to the plane and signed a letter of intent for 45 aircraft, with options for another 30. If the orders are confirmed - there is no guarantee they will be - the slow-selling, overbudget jet will score a much-needed credibility boost and spare Bombardier's Montreal-area assembly lines from echo chamber status.\n\nAir Canada is a stock exchange company and is obligated to adopt the best value-creating strategies for all its shareholders. Maybe the efficient C Series is now deemed the perfect machine for Air Canada's short- and medium-haul routes (a role now ably fulfilled by the airline's Brazilian-made Embraer jets), and maybe the discount to the list price, which was not disclosed, was irresistible. Still, you can bet that Air Canada was on the receiving end of the best persuasive powers of the federal and Quebec governments.\n\nEven as Air Canada revealed its intention to buy the jets, Quebec agreed to drop a lawsuit against Air Canada in exchange for the airline's agreement to conduct maintenance on the C Series planes in Quebec. Sheer coincidence, to be sure.\n\nAerospace and defence companies all over the world enjoy special treatment by their governments. In exchange for goodies such as subsidies, tax breaks, cheap financing and lavish orders, these companies create high-paying manufacturing and engineering jobs that are often the pride and joy of national research and development efforts.\n\nAnd so it is with Bombardier, but somewhere along the line, the largesse turned into an apparently bottomless-pit rescue effort for the C Series without the Bombardier and Beaudoin families being forced to forfeit, or even dilute, their commanding position in the company they created. The extended family controls Bombardier through their A shares, which come with 10 votes apiece. The subordinate B shares, the ones that trade on the stock exchange, come with a mere one vote.\n\nIn 2008, shortly after the C Series was officially launched, (against the advice of a former chief executive officer, Paul Tellier), Bombardier negotiated a $350-million loan from Stephen Harper's Conservative government to help cover the plane's R&D costs. The Quebec and British governments stumped up small fortunes too.\n\nSo far, so good, and not many taxpayers complained, because national champions need to be supported to ensure they remain national champions. But the C Series became a bridge too far for Bombardier. Under former CEO Pierre Beaudoin, the son of Laurent Beaudoin, who is the son-in-law of Bombardier founder Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the company's aerospace division lurched from one crisis to another.\n\nThe executives vastly underestimated the competitive response of Airbus and Boeing, which did not take kindly to the Canadian upstart eating into their market. They made the mistake of launching another ambitious program - the Learjet 85 business jet - at the same time as the C Series (the Learjet program was recently mothballed). They reportedly refused to offer attractive discounts on the C Series to fill up the order book.\n\nThe result was horrendous cash burn, a collapsed share price, few sales - there are only 243 confirmed C Series orders - a two-year delay on the aircraft's commercial launch date and a project that has gone more than $2-billion (U.S.) over budget. But never mind, because the feds and Quebec would come to the rescue.\n\nThe Quebec government pumped $1-billion into the C series project while the province's pension fund manger, the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, invested $1.5-billion into Bombardier Transportation in exchange for a 30-per-cent stake in the Berlin-based train division. On Wednesday, Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare, who replaced the hapless Pierre Beaudoin last year, reiterated his appeal for help from Ottawa. \"A partnership with the federal government into the [C Series] is very important to us,\" he said.\n\nThe feds will probably comply, even if they go to great pains to spin any bailout as a commercial proposition that is in the taxpayers' best interest. But no sacrifice is being demanded of the Bombardier-Beaudoin family. Pierre Beaudoin may not be CEO any longer but he got a sweet consolation prize - executive chairman. The family retains its voting control of the company and is loath to relinquish it, even though its blocking position makes a strategic partnership with another aerospace company somewhere between impossible and difficult. Who wants to get into bed with a family that has veto power over everything?\n\nBombardier is going through a bizarre metamorphosis. It's on its way to becoming, in effect, a ward of the state under the control of a private family. It's a clever trick that should never have been allowed to happen. If Bombardier wants another dollop of taxpayer loot, which it does, the family that oversaw the massive value destruction should be invited to step aside.", "As the Takata air bag saga drags on, concerns are growing that tens of millions of U.S. drivers with cars that haven't been recalled could be at risk of death or injury from the potentially defective devices.\n\nFederal safety regulators last month confirmed that a South Carolina man's death in December was caused by a driver's air bag inflator that wasn't under recall. It was the ninth Takata-related fatality in the U.S.\n\nIn a Feb. 10 letter to Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., urged the agency to recall all Takata inflators in U.S. cars. He said the agency's current approach of issuing recalls piecemeal, \"appears to be confusing many consumers\" who wonder if their cars have an unsafe air bag that hasn't been recalled.\n\nSince 2008, 14 automakers have recalled 24 million vehicles to replace the inflators, which can rupture in a crash, shooting metal shards at the driver and passengers.\n\nExperts say there could be as many as 50 million Takata air bag inflators in cars that have yet to be called back for repairs. For drivers of those vehicles, finding out if their car has a Takata inflator can be tricky. They either have to convince a dealer to take apart the car to look, or get the automaker to tell them. Some, like General Motors and Ford, won't tell. Nissan and Toyota won't say if they will disclose a Takata inflator. Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Mercedes and BMW say they'll tell if asked.\n\nNHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge says the agency doesn't have the data yet to justify a recall of every Takata inflator. The agency has given Takata until the end of 2018 to solve the problem or issue a blanket recall. Takata says it continues to investigate the cause; NHTSA and the auto industry also have investigations under way.\n\nThe death of Joel Knight, 52, underscores how perplexing the search for a solution is. On Dec. 22, Knight's 2006 Ford Ranger struck a cow on a rural road near his home in Kershaw, South Carolina. He died after metal fragments from the driver's inflator impaled his neck. According to a law firm representing Knight's family, the crash was moderate and otherwise survivable.\n\nNHTSA says Knight's driver air bag hadn't been recalled because tests on hundreds of inflators like the one used in his Ranger did not show any failures. The passenger air bag had been recalled.\n\nKnight's death fits into one prevailing theory about the cause of the ruptures: his truck was an older model, and spent a long period of time in a region with high humidity.\n\nTakata is nearly alone among inflator makers in using the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion that inflates the bags in a crash. Tests show that over time, high temperatures and humidity can degrade the chemical, causing it to explode with too much force, rupturing a metal canister that's supposed to contain the explosion. The pieces can hit a car's occupants.\n\nInitially, the recalls targeted older vehicles along the Gulf Coast, and NHTSA has ordered that dealers in those areas receive the bulk of replacement inflators as they're made. But the latest recall from Volkswagen includes cars from 2014, and a recent Honda recall has a 2016 model.\n\n\"Recent events and recalls involving relatively new vehicles with these types of inflators raise serious questions as to whether Takata's ammonium nitrate propellant is inherently dangerous,\" Nelson wrote to Rosekind. \"I am concerned that the current approach may be needlessly incremental and fail to adequately protect public safety.\"\n\nScott Upham, who runs a Rochester, New York, research firm that tracks air bag sales, estimates there are 50 million unrecalled Takata inflators on U.S. roads today.\n\nUntil they're all recalled and fixed \"people are going to keep dying,\" he says.\n\nTakata maintains that most of its inflators are safe, but says it agreed with government demands to stop making those with ammonium nitrate by 2018 -- except for inflators with a drying agent.\n\nAll of the deaths have been caused by driver's inflators, and NHTSA's Trowbridge says all but a few thousand of those without a chemical added to keep them dry have been recalled. That means most of the unrecalled inflators are on the passenger side, where there have been fewer serious injuries.\n\nStill, the piecemeal approach to recalls has allowed the population of Takata inflators to grow so large that a total recall wouldn't immediately fix the problem because replacements can't be manufactured fast enough.\n\nTakata says it and other suppliers can make up to 1.5 million replacement inflators per month, meaning up to 18 million a year. But some of those must go to other countries, where about 30 million more inflators are being recalled.\n\nIn the U.S., it would take about four years to replace inflators now under recall.\n\nSo far, automakers have replaced about 5 million inflators. That low rate is due both to the limited number of inflators and to an issue common to most recalls: People don't take their cars in for repairs, even with a problem this serious.\n\nTwo other senators want to make sure everyone with a Takata inflator can get a replacement.\n\nSens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, in a separate letter this month, asked NHTSA to recall all the inflators and force Takata to publish all makes and models for which it has supplied air bags since 2000. The public also should be allowed to see inflator test results, they said.\n\n\"Every consumer deserves to know whether their vehicle could be lethal in a fender-bender,\" the senators wrote.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

At least 10 people have died worldwide and 139 have been hurt due to the problem.\n\nThe GM recall includes the Saab 9-3 from 2003 to 2011 and the Saab 9-5 from 2010 and 2011 [pictured above]. Also included is the Saturn Astra from 2008 and 2009.\n\nDealers will replace the inflators. Owners will get letters notifying them of the recalls, but since parts aren't available yet, they'll have to wait for a second letter before taking cars to dealers.\n\nGM has no plans to offer loaner cars to people who don't want to drive their vehicles, spokesman Tom Wilkinson said. The type of Takata inflators in the GM cars ruptured only in testing and not in the field, he said. \"Our position is you can continue to drive the cars as normal\" until repairs are made, he said.\n\nThe Saab models under recall were sold in other markets including Europe, while the Astra was sold as an Opel in Europe and elsewhere. Wilkinson said GM's global safety team is reviewing data on the inflators in other markets \"and will respond appropriately.\"\n\nGM sold the Saab brand in 2009 but kept responsibility for administering its recalls. The brand eventually went out of business.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced the latest round of Takata recalls on Jan. 22 after the death of a South Carolina man when an inflator ruptured on a 2006 Ford Ranger, and when testing showed four ruptures on a different type of Takata inflator.\n\nThe latest round of recalls covers vehicles made by GM, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Honda, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Trucks. They bring to about 24.4 million the number of vehicles under recall in the U.S. for Takata air bag problems, affecting 14 car and truck makers. It's already the largest automotive recall in U.S. history, and the government expects it to grow.

But the latest recall from Volkswagen includes cars from 2014, and a recent Honda recall has a 2016 model.\n\n\"Recent events and recalls involving relatively new vehicles with these types of inflators raise serious questions as to whether Takata's ammonium nitrate propellant is inherently dangerous,\" Nelson wrote to Rosekind. \"I am concerned that the current approach may be needlessly incremental and fail to adequately protect public safety.\"\n\nScott Upham, who runs a Rochester, New York, research firm that tracks air bag sales, estimates there are 50 million unrecalled Takata inflators on U.S. roads today.\n\nUntil they're all recalled and fixed \"people are going to keep dying,\" he says.\n\nTakata maintains that most of its inflators are safe, but says it agreed with government demands to stop making those with ammonium nitrate by 2018 - except for inflators with a drying agent.\n\nAll of the deaths have been caused by driver's inflators, and NHTSA's Trowbridge says all but a few thousand of those without a chemical added to keep them dry have been recalled. That means most of the unrecalled inflators are on the passenger side, where there have been fewer serious injuries.\n\nStill, the piecemeal approach to recalls has allowed the population of Takata inflators to grow so large that a total recall wouldn't immediately fix the problem because replacements can't be manufactured fast enough.\n\nTakata says it and other suppliers can make up to 1.5 million replacement inflators per month, meaning up to 18 million a year. But some of those must go to other countries, where about 30 million more inflators are being recalled.\n\nIn the U.S., it would take about four years to replace inflators now under recall.\n\nSo far, automakers have replaced about 5 million inflators. That low rate is due both to the limited number of inflators and to an issue common to most recalls: People don't take their cars in for repairs, even with a problem this serious.\n\nTwo other senators want to make sure everyone with a Takata inflator can get a replacement.\n\nSens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, in a separate letter this month, asked NHTSA to recall all the inflators and force Takata to publish all makes and models for which it has supplied air bags since 2000. The public also should be allowed to see inflator test results, they said.\n\n\"Every consumer deserves to know whether their vehicle could be lethal in a fender-bender,\" the senators wrote.", "When cars like the brand-new BMW M2 come out, there's so much hype behind its release that sometimes people are let down by the end ...\n\nWhen cars like the brand-new BMW M2 come out, there's so much hype behind its release that sometimes people are let down by the end result. People have been begging the Bavarians for this car ever since the 2 Series went on sale. So now that it's finally here, it's possible for us BMW fans to get caught up in all of the hype, declaring it the greatest car in the world. But for, who are supposed to be, objective journalists, things can be different. They can call out a car for its faults despite how great it's been said to be. So how did the M2 perform through the worldwide lens of objectivity?\n\nWell, after reading several reviews and articles about the BMW M2 and its launch even at sunny California, we can say that the BMW M2 killed it.\n\nThe M2 has so universally lived up to its hype that it's shocking. Surely, someone would have something negative to say about it, right? Turns out, not really. Sure, it has some minor faults, but everyone is so willing to look over them because of how incredible the rest of the car is. The only other car in recent memory that's been so universally loved is the Porsche Cayman GT4, and that's some astonishingly good company. In fact, according to Auto Express, the M2 is closer to the Cayman than anything else, in terms of how fun it is to drive. \"It eclipses its rivals from Audi and Mercedes, instead drawing comparison with cars like the Porsche Cayman.\" EVO also seems to think that the M2 is in a higher league than its rivals from Audi and Mercedes-Benz \"It's about fifty times more exciting than the effective but rather dull [Mercedes] A45 AMG and more enjoyable and interactive than an Audi RS3.\"\n\nEveryone seems to love the little M2 and seems to find it to be a return to form for BMW, as the Bavarian brand is often criticized for becoming too soft. Well, the M2 sets things straight and proves that not many companies know how to make small performance coupes better than BMW. \" The 2016 BMW M2 is superb. Lay out your criteria for a contemporary sport coupe. Then check all the boxes.\" says Autoblog. And that's exactly what the M2 is, a proper sports coupe. There's nothing superfluous about it, it's just a driver's car, nothing else. There isn't an ounce of fat on the M2. And that shows through its steering, handling and overall driving dynamics. According to Top Gear, on what makes the M2 so special, \"The handling. It's just superb. For a start, you don't have to be going bonkers-fast to feel what the M2 is up to. It's up-for-it and chatting with you all the time.\"\n\nThe BMW M2 is garnering incredibly high praise from every single automotive outlet you can imagine, and even some outlets that don't typically care about cars, like PC World. The folks over there have been discussing a lot of the tech that goes into cars lately and are just as upset at the idea of driverless cars as we are. But the M2 is the furthest thing from a driverless car, according to PC World. \"I found myself on the track at Laguna Seca, following BMW factory racer Bill Auberlen in the new M2 -- and it was one of the most driver-full experiences I've ever had.\".\n\nWhen you get a technology publication raving about your car, you've got to feel pretty good about yourself, as a car company. And onlooking rivals need must be sweating while looking at the M2 crush Laguna Seca, as it looks like BMW is back and that's a very scary thought for other German automakers. Mercedes-AMG and Audi must be shaking in their lederhosen right now, as neither the A45 AMG nor the RS3 can match the M2 for sheer fun and driving dynamics and they know it. The BMW M2 is a sensational car and one of the very few that's lived up to its hype. It's everything we hoped it would be and more.", "From Netherlands comes a video of a BMW M2 featuring the Black Sapphire Metallic color. The car being unloaded from a transportation truck before heading into the dealership showroom.

Also included is the Saturn Astra from 2008 and 2009.\n\nDealers will replace the inflators. Owners will get letters notifying them of the recalls, but since parts aren't available yet, they'll have to wait for a second letter before taking cars to dealers.\n\nGM has no plans to offer loaner cars to people who don't want to drive their vehicles, spokesman Tom Wilkinson said. The type of Takata inflators in the GM cars ruptured only in testing and not in the field, he said. \"Our position is you can continue to drive the cars as normal\" until repairs are made, he said.\n\nThe Saab models under recall were sold in other markets including Europe, while the Astra was sold as an Opel in Europe and elsewhere. Wilkinson said GM's global safety team is reviewing data on the inflators in other markets \"and will respond appropriately.\"\n\nGM sold the Saab brand in 2009 but kept responsibility for administering its recalls. The brand eventually went out of business.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced the latest round of Takata recalls on Jan. 22 after the death of a South Carolina man when an inflator ruptured on a 2006 Ford Ranger, and when testing showed four ruptures on a different type of Takata inflator.\n\nThe latest round of recalls covers vehicles made by GM, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Honda, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Trucks. They bring to about 24.4 million the number of vehicles under recall in the U.S. for Takata air bag problems, affecting 14 car and truck makers. It's already the largest automotive recall in U.S. history, and the government expects it to grow. Worldwide, about 50 million inflators are under recall.", "The planned joint venture with LeEco secures financing to take the battery-powered version of the current Rapide sports car from concept to production.\n\nAston Martin Lagonda Ltd., maker of sports cars such as the DB9, plans to team up with LeEco of China to help bring its electric RapidE vehicle to market by 2018.\n\nLeEco intends to provide the powertrain and battery pack for the vehicle to be built at Aston Martin's factory in Gaydon, England, the companies said in Frankfurt on Wednesday.

It has said it plans to roll out a new model or variant every eight to nine months.", "LOS ANGELES, California -- Three car generations and 14 years since BMW revived the Mini brand, it's forming its own heritage. In the case of the 2016 Mini Cooper S convertible (and its hardtop sibling), signature styling elements that evoke those of the original Austin Mini Minor survive, but we are now 50-plus years beyond Mary Quant's scandalously short skirts and the London that \"swings like a pendulum do.\" More Americans can quote the funniest lines from Austin Powers movies than can identify Austin-Rover as a defunct carmaker. Mini today is a BMW sub-brand of front-drive cars with German engineering marketed with a thin layer of \"British\" design charm bolstered by assembly (mostly) in Oxford, England.This topless model is just the latest variation on the platform introduced in two-door hardtop form two model years ago. Like the hardtop, it's larger than before, with a longer front overhang that controversially stretches the signature bulldog snout to schnauzer-like dimensions. It's a more sophisticated and refined car made with higher-quality materials. It employs BMW TwinPower Turbo engines in three-cylinder Cooper, four-cylinder Cooper S, and high-performance John Cooper Works (JCW) models. The ragtop goes on sale in March (April for the JCW) just in time for warm weather in most of the country. It was an unseasonably warm 85-degree day when we drove the Cooper S in and around Los Angeles in early February. BMW/Mini leaders profess they are surprised -- pleasantly -- that the brand has been so well-received in America with sales rising steadily, even last year in the face of low gas prices and a general trend away from small cars. Mini, remember, was a heritage/retro-car project BMW expected would do better in Europe than America, where the original Austin/Morris models never sold in any significant volume. The new one arrived in 2002 as the smallest car on the U.S. market. It never played into the small-equals-cheap mindset, instead becoming a fashion statement on wheels with a long list of personalization options. It's not the small car you buy because you need to save money, so sales are not particularly susceptible to gas price variations. That said, Mini is \"repositioning the brand,\" says David Duncan, vice president of Mini of the Americas. He's been with Mini from the start, in 2001 (coming over from the BMW motorcycle side), and became VP in 2014. Duncan says his growth strategy centers on the Clubman, Mini's biggest, most luxurious model. Given market trends toward crossovers, he's also eager to bring on a new Countryman ALL4, which is due for an update to the latest BMW/Mini hardware.Focus for now is on launching the JCW Convertible at April's New York Auto Show. We were shown one -- an early right-hand drive example -- and told it would boast 228 horsepower, up 20 from the 2015 version. But the JCW could not be driven. Nor did Mini offer up any of its base U.S.-spec convertibles. The three-cylinder Mini Cooper that boasts a starting price of $24,900 (before destination fee) and claims to be the only European-made convertible costing less than $25,000? Nope. Our choices for driving were: Cooper S in Caribbean Aqua or Melting Silver paint, manual or automatic. Make it a Melting Silver manual with the cool new option of a roof with a gray Union Jack pattern woven into the black fabric. As before, the roof opens in two stages with a sunroof function that slides the forward portion back while the remainder stays in place. Now, though, the opening is 16 inches, 1 inch bigger and, more significantly, the entire operation is electric. Folding the whole roof takes 18 seconds, and it's almost eerily silent in operation, banishing memories of hydraulic systems that can sound like a garbage truck visit at 3 a.m. The top still stacks awkwardly over the trunk space, but no more so than on Volkswagen's offerings. As with the hardtop, the cargo space is bigger than before by 25 percent. A two-position divider can hide the entire space from view (in which case the top can still be opened to the sunroof position, but not entirely) or lowered to permit a fully folded top. You lose 1.9 of the 7.6 cubic feet that way, bur retain access to the split-folding rear seat. As small convertibles go, it's pretty convenient.On the road we find the latest wind-blocker easier to mount and lighter to lift while really doing the job of shielding occupants from buffeting at highway speeds. Chassis stiffening is well-done, with no evident flex even when we took it on a hard run up a canyon road, and no more vibration than in the hardtop model. Annoyingly, the rear seat headrests intrude in the driver's vision through the rear-view mirror and cannot be lowered. Mini engineers explained that the U.S. regulatory standard sets a minimum distance between the seat-cushion (H-point) and center of the headrest, so the lowering function available in European Minis can't be offered here. The headrests are removable, though, so if no one is sitting back there, the only necessary obstruction to your view would be the top stack. The latest version of active rollover protection is integrated more tidily than was the big chrome bar in the previous model. It's now a pair of vertical posts, mostly tucked away out of sight, that deploy pyrotechnically when sensors detect trouble. Overall, driving was much as in the hardtop -- only with fresh air, sunshine, and a higher price on what is, already, a not-cheap small car. In this Cooper S form, Mini says 60 mph should come up in the mid- to high-6 second range though we suspect that's conservative. Still, plenty of crossovers are in the 6s, so for all its nimble character the Cooper S Convertible is more about fun in the sun than serious performance. The JCW may change that equation, though the previous one exacted too high a price in comfort and money to seem worthwhile. There are among us those who say the hardtop version of this generation of Mini works best in base Cooper form. It might be so for the convertible, too, unless you're measuring the profits in Munich. 2016 Mini Cooper S Convertible Specifications On Sale: March Price: $30,450 (base Cooper S) Engines: 2.0L turbocharged DOHC 16-valve I-4/189 hp @ 5,000 rpm, 207 lb-ft @ 1,250 rpm Transmission: 6-speed manual Layout: 2-door, 4-passenger, front-engine, FWD convertible EPA Mileage: 25/34 mpg (city/hwy) L x W x H: 151.9 x 68.0 x 55.7 in Wheelbase: 98.2 in Weight: 3,025 lb 0-60 MPH: 6.7 sec Top Speed: 142 mph", "FWAAAP... FWAAAP... FWAAAP... that's one of the most enjoyable sounds heard behind the wheel of the BMW M2 on the Laguna Seca track in California. That particular sound comes from the contact between the Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires and the low-profile ridges at the entry points, apexes and exit points of the 11 curves along this 3.6-km circuit.\n\nThe track also includes striking elevation changes, like the one on turns 8 and 8A, known as the famous Corkscrew, that drops the equivalent height of a seven-storey building. Fortunately, my first experience here dates back to 1981, when the track was even faster than in its current form, and I immediately found my way around. What happened next? Nothing less than pure happiness...\n\nSpiritual successor to the 2002 Turbo\n\nThe new 2016 BMW M2 is in some way the spiritual descendent of the legendary 2002 Turbo, sold by the German manufacturer in the Seventies. A more direct lineage also exists with the 1 Series M Coup\u00e9, which won The Car Guide's sports car comparison test in 2012.\n\nHowever, unlike the 1M Coup\u00e9 that was a skunkworks project built almost secretly by a group of M division engineers, and without the support of BMW management, the development of the current M2 was performed in parallel with the 2 Series range. The M2's official launch was officially held at the latest Detroit Auto Show.\n\nReady for the track\n\nOn the very fast Laguna Seca circuit, which requires the greatest possible momentum in curves, the M2 is truly in its element. Weight? 1,565 kg with the standard six-speed manual gearbox, or 1,590 kg with the seven-speed, dual-clutch transmission. Weight distribution? Almost perfect at 51% front and 49% rear. Tires? Michelin Pilot Super Sport rubber, 245/35R19 at the front and 265/35R19 at the rear.\n\nOutput? 365 horsepower, almost as much as in the new Porsche 911 Carrera. Torque? 343 pound-feet, or 369 with the Overboost function. Chassis? Almost the same one as the M3, with a forged aluminum suspension and an active electronic differential. Technically, all the elements come together to boost driving pleasure in this coupe that boasts a classic silhouette.\n\nEasier to drive at its limits than the M4\n\nOn the Laguna Seca track, the 2016 BMW M2 is both agile and playful, and easier to drive at the limit than the M4. To optimize handling in this particular environment, the driver can simply activate the Sport Plus mode to delay the electronic stability control system's intervention, allowing some terrific, throttle-controlled drifts while exiting a corner and keeping that electronic \"safety net\" in case the pilot messes up.\n\nAdd to that the Smokey Burnout feature, available with the dual-clutch gearbox, which allows wheelspin during full-throttle acceleration. We instantly become one of our tire supplier's favourite customers... the BMW M2 even includes two custom-tailored applications for driving on a track; one can control a GoPro camera while the other records lap times.\n\nWhat we like less\n\nAmong the car's weak points, let's mention the almost symbolic rear seats, very faint turbo lag (that's more noticeable on the road than on the track), a ride that's not too comfortable even with the Comfort mode activated on the highway as well as the torturous design of the openings located on each side of the big air vent in the front bumper. There isn't much to complain about.\n\nWe can't even criticize BMW in regards to the car's price or the cost of options. The MSRP is set at $61,000 with the manual gearbox, and only three options are available: the dual-clutch transmission ($3,900), the Convenience Telephony package ($600) and metallic paint ($895).\n\nFor driving enthusiasts, the M2 isn't lacking in qualities to win them over, and buyers' expectations will be met in this car that will provide great thrills behind the wheel, as long they're willing to sacrifice comfort. The only thing that's left to do is choose the colour.", "SALEM, Ore.

It looked like a dreary Kia or Hyundai that had been squashed and had a BMW badge stuck on it, but it sold like hotcakes.\n\nInside it was cramped and full of scratchy plastics, yet somehow BMW sold 700,000 of them and last year in the UK it outsold the more luxurious BMW X3.\n\nIt was universally derided by the motoring press as a mongrel based on an old BMW estate and parts from the spare-parts bin. Forget that car, though, because the BMW X1 has been reborn. That means it's no longer based on a rear-wheel-drive estate; it's based on the platform found under the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer people carrier, as well as the Mini Countryman, which I reviewed here a few weeks ago.\n\nThis new set-up should make the BMW X1 a better beast, and it doesn't disappoint. The new platform means the BMW design team has been about to sketch the X1 as a conventional off-roader from the start, not some bloated estate. So it gets four-wheel drive and higher ground clearance, enabling some sensible off-roading. Competing in the Dakar Rally in one would be suicide, but it will cross a muddy field in midwinter.\n\nRead more Volvo V60 Cross Country: Don't hitch yourself up to this\n\nFew will use it for either, though; this will be found as a commuting wagon on Britain's motorways or busy ferrying children on the school run. The cabin is comfortable and near-silent at cruising speed, though some of those scratchy plastics and a clunky gear lever remain. However, the powerful diesel unit is fairly quiet, while it's possible to drive at speed without feeling like you are drunk at the controls of a heavy-goods lorry, by which I mean it corners well and sticks to the road when you throw it around.\n\nCompared with the old X1 (or pretty much any other SUV) the new BMW X1 is a solid car. It's reasonably economical, covers ground rapidly and while it's at the premium end of the off-roaders on the market, it isn't as pricey as some of its BMW stablemates. The problem is, there is nothing exciting or particularly enjoyable about it. You'd be pleased to get one as a company car or as a free upgrade at an airport car-hire counter, but I'm not sure what would ever entice you to buy one. That's what most car reviewers said about the old X1, though, so what do we know? I expect this one to sell in droves.\n\nMore about: BMW", "Yamaha. We were so so patient with you.

For such a slight price difference on a first year model, I would 100% go with that kickass yellow, but thats just me.\n\nUtilizing the three cylinder engine from the FZ-09, a power plant that other motorcycle magazines and reviewers have had nothing but good things to say about, the XSR900 comes out as a well rounded and approachable bike that hits that price point perfectly.\n\nWe see this bike as being a lower priced competition for the BMW R nineT and right in line with the new Triumph Bonnevilles.

This past year alone, the Camaro was all-new while the Mustang added the flat-plane crank GT350, a car Ford says is the most track-capable Mustang ever. We tested both cars together, and found that the regular V-8-powered Camaro SS is a close match for the GT350.\n\nCHECK OUT: \u200bFord Shelby GT350 Vs. Chevy Camaro SS: Video Throwdown\n\nNow, if you are willing to believe Camaro chief engineer Al Oppenheiser, the new Camaro 1LE package will be faster around a racetrack than the GT350. In an interview with GM Authority, Oppenheiser was asked if the 2017 Camaro SS 1LE will outperform the Shelby GT350. He replied: \"That's obviously our intent. I have the answer, but I'll let the rest of you decide how we did. Our goal is to up the game with our competitor, just like they upped the game with the GT350. Everyone had to expect we would punch back. I will tell you this car is three seconds faster than the previous 1LE. Your readers can go out and make their own conclusions.\"\n\nChevrolet performed a lot of track testing on the 1LE and Oppenheiser claims it is three seconds quicker around a two-minute track than the last version.

Slap on a mountain of chrome trim, and you've got the quintessential showoff-truck.\n\nBut the inside is where the Escalade wins our praise.

The group first saw the ousting of its longtime chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, and then the resignation of its chief executive Martin Winterkorn in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal. Winterkorn's departure kicked off a wave of reassignments, with Porsche chief Matthias M\u00fcller named his successor and Oliver Blume appointed head of Porsche in his place.

Santiago Orjuela dicing with Brian Redman in the LeMans class winning BMW CSL in 1973.\n\nThe CSL was built for BMW by Karmann between 1968 and 1975. The car was a svelte 2400lbs with 3.2-liter (340 hp/253 kW) and 3.5-liter (430 PS) engines and aerodynamics that dubbed the CSL as the \"Batmobile\", but it also established BMW as a premier racing team.\n\nIn 1973, Toine Hezemans won the European Touring Car Championship in a 3.0CSL and co-drove a 3.0CSL with Dieter Quester to a class victory at Le Mans. Hezemans and Quester had driven to second place at the 1973 German Touring Car Grand Prix at N\u00fcrburgring, being beaten only by Chris Amon and Hans-Joachim Stuck in another 3.0 CSL.\n\nThis final version of the 3.0CSL was homologated in July 1973 along with an aerodynamic package including a large air dam, short fins running along the front fenders, a spoiler above and behind the trailing edge of the roof, and a tall rear wing. The rear wings were not installed at the factory, but were left in the boot for installation after purchase.\n\nThe 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL won the 12 Hours of Sebring that year with \"Bavarian Motor Works\" prominently displayed on its windshield, firmly establishing BMW's legacy in American motorsports which continues to this day. The BMW 3.0 CSL victory at Sebring helped give credence to the now legendary tagline \"The Ultimate Driving Machine,\" a phrase BMW has used uninterrupted for the past 40 years.", "As BMW prepares to bring its new G310 R to market this year, I thought it appropriate to take a look back at some of ...\n\nAs BMW prepares to bring its new G310 R to market this year, I thought it appropriate to take a look back at some of the company's previous attempts at offering small displacement, entry models.\n\nBy today's standards, BMW's first bike was a small displacement machine. As the company, today, competes in the over 500cc premium segment, its first model, the R32 and its 486cc engine would seem rather out of place among the brand's current offerings. The G 310 R will be the brand's first offering in the sub-500cc premium segment, in modern times. However, the R32 was not an 'entry-level' machine.\n\nThe brand's first attempt at producing an 'affordable' model, the R39 of 1925, too had a single cylinder engine like the G310 R. However, I'm sure that the Bavarians are hoping that the R39's sales performance is no indicator of how the G 310 R will sell, when it's introduced. The R39 sold very poorly and was discontinued only two years later. Maybe it was that entry model stigma?\n\nHowever, at the time, the failure of the R39 was of little significance as the firm's more expensive and more profitable offerings were selling well, in the context of premium vehicles. After 1929, and the economic tumult accompanying it, everything changed. The premium motorcycle market largely dried up. Consequently, BMW was forced to bring a machine for the masses to market.\n\nThis time, as the world was suffering economically, BMW had slightly better luck. In 1931, BMW introduced the R2. Also utilizing a single cylinder power plant, the R2 had only 198cc, making it, still, the smallest engine of any BMW motorcycle ever. Compared to the rest of the company's offerings, the R2 cost very little at only 975RM.\n\nThe price wasn't the only draw. Due to its extremely small engine size, riders could operate the R2 without even having a motorcycle license. How comforting. The R2 also enabled riders to evade the road tax. BMW managed to sell over 15,000 examples of the R2, making it a relatively successful model, in the context of the economic climate. However, for greater context, when economic conditions improved in Germany, BMW's R12 with its high price and its 750cc engine, it catapulted BMW sales to over 10,000 units in a single year.\n\nFast forward many years, to the 1970's and BMW is preparing to offer a new entry-level bike. R45 production began in 1978 and ended in 1985. The R45 was criticized as not living up to the BMW name and for being too weak. Just over 28,000 units were sold during its production run. Largely considered as a commercial failure, it failed to sell better than or even as well as its larger sibling the R65. Again, for context, by 1982 the firm was selling more than 37,000 motorcycles in a single year.\n\nThough the past is not necessarily indicative of future events, it seems that maybe BMW's upcoming G 310 R might have had a better chance of success if it had been brought to market in 2008 rather than during 2016. Too, the brand's history as a whole illustrates well how the 'keep going downmarket' crowd's strategy is highly flawed, particularly when economic conditions are good.\n\nBMW Motorrad is an aspirational brand, whose bikes are priced accordingly. Its best-selling models are consistently bikes with engines over 1000cc and its sub-1000cc displacement offerings fail to sell anywhere near as well. Maybe if BMW wants to seek much larger volumes, it should establish another brand through which to do so.\n\nIn the 60s, BMW acquired a fellow German firm whom produced small displacement two-wheeled vehicles, as well as automobiles, named Glas. As pursuing too much volume, particularly through offerings below a certain price point is imprudent for a premium brand, resurrecting the Glas name could enable BMW to produce non-premium, volume vehicles without consequence to its core brand's equity and its concomitantly greater profit margins. This strategy, of course, applies to both its motorcycle and automotive divisions.", "The super limited 2016 BMW M6 Competition Package is starting to arrive at U.S. dealerships.

We spent some quality time with the M235i last year and were deeply impressed. We also sampled the M4, and were impressed for different reasons.\n\nIt's not a true apples-to-apples comparison. Yes, both are two-door machines. But the M235i comes to the contest with 320 horsepower, while the M4 has ... 420. The M235i also isn't a true M Sport car, but rather more of a kinda-sorta M car that landed ahead of the true M2, which arrives this year.\n\nThe M235i is lighter, but the M4 isn't exactly heavy, giving up only a few hundred pounds (depending on configuration) to the sprightlier bimmer.\n\nInterestingly, in Auto Bild's race, the M235i gets a better jump off the line and has the M4 playing catchup ... until the 100 km/hr barrier (62 mph) is breached. At that point, the M235i is tapped out, but the M4 has more to give.\n\nScreenshot via YouTube\n\nStill, the M235i's performance to more or less the legal US speed limit shows you that you don't always need to have the biggest, baddest motor to feel like you're going fast. Sometimes, you're actually going faster than the guy with the bigger, badder motor.\n\nIt's a little something called power-to-weight ratio.\n\nTo be honest, we could see the result of the Auto Bild test coming. In our experience, the M235i was like driving a Sidewinder missile, while the M4 was like saddling up on an angry dragon. The Sidewinder just goes.

It seems radical, but it's not a bad idea. It could also be a decision that drags the automaker to the altar for an alliance that makes way too much sense not to happen.Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of FCA, recently revised his business plan to mitigate production issues in North America. He wants to free up plant space in Belvidere, Illinois, where the Dodge Dart is assembled, and Sterling Heights, Michigan, where the Chrysler 200 is assembled, in order to build more crossovers and trucks.\n\n2016 Chrysler 200C\n\nBut don't think Marchionne will leave his dealers in the cold. He can't afford to get out of the passenger-car business because he has to meet fuel economy and emissions regulations like everyone else. Trucks and SUVs won't get FCA there. Mr. Marchionne, meet Matthias M\u00fcller (above left, right, respectively), CEO of the Volkswagen Group, and Dr. Herbert Diess, head of the Volkswagen brand worldwide. Herr M\u00fcller and Herr Diess, meet Mr. Marchionne.You see, your two companies have matching needs. FCA makes mediocre small and midsize passenger cars that require vast incentives as soon as they hit the dealer lots. The Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 have cornered the market in indifference, selling only with huge incentives. Two of its dealers have even accused Fiat Chrysler of paying such dealerships for reporting unsold cars as sold before the end of a month to boost total numbers, the Detroit News has reported.Volkswagen, meanwhile, has two plants in North America -- one in Puebla, Mexico, and another near Chattanooga, Tennessee. The latter is quite underutilized, more so now as VW grapples with its diesel scandal, which restricts its Tennessee plant to gas-powered-only Passat sedans.Volkswagen has a Ford Explorer-sized SUV in development that it plans to produce in Tennessee. And it has been moving at the speed of stone to bring it to market. Then what? One obvious addition to its showrooms could be a VW-badged Jeep Renegade. How about a Ram pickup for VW dealers? A Chrysler-badged Passat for FCA? It's a nice car.\n\n2016 Volkswagen Passat\n\nThere are a lot of problems with the two companies just selling rebadged cars. Historically, consumers smell this out and don't bite in big numbers. One exception was the Chevrolet Nova/Geo Prizm of the 1980s and '90s; they were built in the General Motors-Toyota NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, alongside the Toyota Corolla. But when Volkswagen sold a Chrysler minivan as the Routan, a few dozen bought the vehicle. So, success is not a slam-dunk.The other problem is that Fiat and VW don't like each other much. Marchionne was pretty blunt in his public comments from 2009 through 2012 about VW dumping vehicles at low cost in Europe during the Great Recession, as a way of grabbing market share and hurting companies such as Fiat, Peugeot and Renault. Meanwhile, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech was attempting a forced takeover of FCA's Alfa Romeo.But the bottom line is Marchionne is a pragmatist, and he will be attracted to a deal that makes sense. An alliance with VW could free up enough cash at FCA to allow Marchionne to realize his ambitious plans to rebuild Alfa as a credible BMW competitor. And VW chairman M\u00fcller must understand by now that VW's own product pipeline for North America does not lend itself to VW realizing anything close to its target of 1 million vehicles a year. He needs help.With Chrysler's advantage in pickups, SUVs and crossovers, and VW's strength in passenger cars, and both companies in need of spreading electric vehicle and hybrid technology across more vehicles, they would seem to be the right match for an alliance. What could go wrong? Lots. VW already has too many brands to worry about -- Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Audi, Porsche, VW, Seat, Skoda, MAN, Scania Trucks and Ducati. The organization's collective head could explode if it tries to manage an alliance with FCA. Volkswagen and Fiat do not trust each other, so that hurts a deal's viability. But perhaps they have people who have been studying the alliance between Daimler and Nissan-Renault to see how such a relationship can work when grown-ups are tasked with running it.If neither company can afford to go it alone in North America, as Marchionne has suggested, then perhaps the two companies can figure out a way to harness their respective strengths for mutual benefit.", "A BLIND Bradford man who was described as the \"mastermind\" behind a sophisticated drugs plot has been ordered to pay back nearly \u00a3250,000 from his ill-gotten gains.\n\nRizwan Arshad is currently serving a 21-year prison sentence for his role as the leader of a gang which conspired together to distribute heroin and cocaine in Bradford and Huddersfield.\n\nThe 33-year-old was jailed in 2014 for his involvement in three separate conspiracies, but today he was back in court to face a further hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\n\nArshad, of Lower Rushton Road, Thornbury, appeared at Bradford Crown Court alongside co-defendants Matthew Francois and Aftab Basharat, who were also jailed for their roles.\n\nFrancois, 36, of Benny Park Close, Batley, was jailed for 10 years after he was said to have been the head of the Huddersfield side of the operation.\n\nBasharat, 25, of Derby Road, Bradford, received an eight-year sentence for his involvement.\n\nToday Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC was told that Arshad's benefit from criminal conduct had been assessed at \u00a3567,180.\n\nBack in 2012 Arshad was caught in a taxi with just over \u00a3108,000 in cash and today/yesterday Judge Durham Hall said that money would have to be paid over within 28 days.\n\nArshad's other available assets were said to be worth a further \u00a3137,765 and the judge ordered that amount to be paid within three months.\n\nIf Arshad does not pay up he faces a further 18 months in prison.\n\nFrancois' benefit figure was said to \u00a3243,505.03, but the court heard his available assets amounted to just \u00a3533.\n\nHe will get an extra month in prison if he does not pay up.\n\nBasharat's benefit figure was calculated to be \u00a3257,180, but he has no available assets at present so the judge made a nominal order of just \u00a31 in his case.\n\nArshad, who used a BMW car he obtained through a Motability scheme, was helped by drivers and \"lieutenants\" to run his drugs activities.\n\nHe was said to have had a second home in Salford Quays and he took trips to Dubai and Amsterdam as well as a holiday with his wife in Mauritius.\n\nDuring the police inquiry more than \u00a3250,000 worth of cocaine was seized, along with \u00a350,00 worth of heroin and 33 kilograms of cutting agents.", "Visual elements are an increasingly important part of infotainment systems. Here, HD Radio in a BMW at CES.\n\nAcronym-heavy technologies drove many headlines, from VR to IoT, the latter of which is expected to help lead the consumer technology industry to $287 billion in retail revenues this year, according to the Consumer Technology Association, which produces the show.\n\nBut radio broadcasting and audio technologies sat front and center as features of in-car apps and boosting interest in the newest interactive after-market dashboard screens.\n\nLEAN BACK\n\nWhy does radio -- a legacy technology when compared to many offerings at CES -- remain a stalwart?\n\n\"The so-called 'lean-forward' and 'lean-back' behaviors of consumers haven't changed,\" said Mike Bergman, senior director of technology and standards for the Consumer Technology Association, which produces CES.\n\n\"Some consumers still want to be directly involved in the selection of each [music] program and each track. Other consumers want to lean back and have great content delivered to them, and many consumers exhibit both behaviors, depending on their mood.\n\n\"Radio is a great example of a lean-back service,\" he continued. \"The hardware is available in all infotainment packages, from the most basic to the most advanced; and we are still seeing innovation in radio technologies and user interfaces.\"\n\nOf the nine carmakers and 115 or so automotive tech companies at CES 2016, almost all showcased product that included radio.\n\nContent also continues to drive radio's appeal. \"Radio is like a companion show,\" said Bob Pittman, CEO of iHeartMedia, during a session at CES. He noted that radio reaches 93 percent of U.S. adult listeners. \"Users who are driving or can't interact with their phone can still connect with a personality on the radio.\"\n\n\"There is now this demand for more content options,\" said Geoff Snyder, vice president of automotive business development for Pandora. He said the streaming media company has begun to introduce comedy and secure streaming rights for serial podcasts in an effort to widen content offerings.\n\nContent is expected to evolve further, as radio considers what role it will next play in the newest trend in automobile design: the introduction of self-driving autonomous automobiles.\n\n\"We are on the road to autonomy. That's the next step forward,\" said Sherif Marakby, director of global electronic systems engineering at Ford Motor Company, who spoke at a panel about the role that entertainment plays in the car. At CES, Ford announced plans to triple its fleet of self-driving test vehicles by the end of this year; General Motors announced a partnership with Lyft to develop a fleet of self-driving vehicles.\n\nWhat role does radio begin to play in this new environment?\n\nThe driving experience changes when the driver -- without a constant eye on the road -- becomes a full-time passenger who can consume new radio, curated music services and entertainment options. At CES, Volvo jumped on this idea and announced a partnership with Ericsson to develop new high-bandwidth streaming capabilities in autonomous automobiles that will bring in new audio and video options, including pre-curated content tailored to the exact duration of a trip across town.\n\nAs radio looks ahead, it should consider how the melding of technologies in the car will impact the industry. Several car manufacturers -- including BMW, Ford, Toyota, VW, Chrysler, Audi and GM -- touted the promise of connected car technologies and made key announcements at CES, many of which centered around the promise of using mobile devices to sync streamed audio directly into a car's dashboard more seamlessly.\n\nIn her 2016 CES keynote address, GM Chairman/CEO Mary Barra said the company's goal is to have 12 million connected vehicles on the road this year. \"The convergence of connectivity, vehicle electrification and evolving customer needs demand new solutions,\" she said.\n\nTo that end, a number of auto manufacturers announced integration with streaming audio programs, mirroring ongoing growth of the platform. In 2015, consumer use of streaming services was up 93 percent, according to a recent Nielsen Music report.\n\nApple said that to date, \"every major automobile manufacturer\" either supports or plans to integrate CarPlay into future models. Other streaming audio announcements revolved around Ford's new partnership with Google's Android Auto, as well as integration with Amazon Prime Music into BMW, Ford and Mini models.\n\nAt the show, mobile application developer jacapps announced that the company's V4 app platform will support Google's Android Auto to enable Android smartphone users with an Android Auto-enabled car to stream radio station broadcasts and access podcasts.\n\n\"The car is becoming part of the digital lifestyle,\" said Thom Brenner, vice president of digital products and services for BMW. \"As cars become connected, we OEMs need to think through how we add our devices make it seamless with their needs. Things that start outside of the car and need to continue in the car as needed.\"\n\nOther technology iterations on the show floor included new aftermarket dashboard technologies from the likes of Kenwood, Pioneer and Alpine, the latter of which inked connected partnerships with Apple CarPlay and Airbiquity, which will support iHeartRadio and Spotify audio apps. iHeartMedia made its own announcements in the form of integration with Apple TV, which will allow Apple TV users to access the core elements of the iHeartRadio app.\n\nOne trend that the radio industry should absorb: Customers increasingly look for experiences that personalize content.\n\niHeartRadio, for one, announced that its users will be able to play live and custom radio stations, view recommendations, save favorite stations and access its newest feature, known as My Favorites Radio, which combines a user's favorite stations and artists into one station.\n\nYet despite the wealth of interconnected technologies and options that were abundant across CES, customers also are looking for simplification.\n\n\"The more features you put in, the more you potentially fragment,\" said John McFarland, director of global insights and brand strategy for GM's Global Connected Customer Experience division.\n\n\"For all the advances we have, we have also seen that there is a lot of power having a simple button in the car to select an experience. Simplicity will continue to be a focus.\"\n\nThe show also featured an increase in the number of high-resolution audio devices like aftermarket auto receivers, including new options from Dual Electronics, whose in-car unit promises playback of lossless music files streamed from a smartphone over WiFi.\n\nIt remains to be seen what radio must to do to hold its place as a key feature in tomorrow's integrated dashboards, though many believe that radio -- in one form or another -- will be a key part of that future.\n\n\"Music [remains] the core entertainment experience in the car,\" Pandora's Snyder said.", "There's something unique about Jaguars. For some people it's the\u00c2 aristocratically British\u00c2 character, sporty pedigree and classic, elegant style of Jaguars that make them special. For others it's the\u00c2 strange technical solutions, uncomfortable compromises and utter lack of reliability that make Jaguars a non-option.\n\nThese\u00c2 two groups aren't likely to agree about much when it comes to Britain's luxury marque, but both camps\u00c2 will likely be of the opinion that a four-cylinder diesel engine doesn't fit the\u00c2 driving experience emoted by Jaguar's\u00c2 iconic Leaper.\n\nWill the upcoming Jaguar XF 2.0-liter diesel still be a proper Jag? Or will its stops at oily diesel pumps also frequented by\u00c2 Ford Super Duty pickups and NOx-belching Volkswagens cover the\u00c2 brand's grand sporting image in a thin layer of soot?\n\nWe already have it in Europe, so I took the\u00c2 opportunity to find out.\n\nNow is the time to say that I've always been in the aforementioned first camp. I love Jaguars. In the beginning, I loved them because they were the paragon of Britishness; a classic, four-eyed XJ saloon perfectly complemented the country-manor-home-and-tweed-jacket anglophile version of myself which I'd always dreamed.\n\nLater, when I dug deeper in the brand's history and character, I realized how deeply flawed the notion was of a Jaguar as a sedate, old man's car. I learned more about the brand's racing heritage and found out just how sporty were the brand's classic models.\n\nShortly thereafter, I drove one or two examples and I bought one of my own: a beautiful, white '79 Jaguar XJ6L. About the same time, I started to abhor the retro styling of the then-current generation of Jags. When I did a comparison test of my Series II with a brand-new X350 XJ 2.7 diesel, I loved that the new XJ\u00c2 kept the traditional sporty-yet-compliant suspension. I even liked its\u00c2 diesel torque generator, which was surprisingly refined and offered dynamics similar to my 4.2-liter XK-series inline-six \u00e2\u0080\" the only difference being\u00c2 15 mpg. But I hated the bodywork. It looked like someone skinned a cat, then put the skin on a bulldog.\n\nSo when the first XF came out, I loved it. Finally, a Jag that looked as dynamic and modern as the original XJ did in 1968. If you peeked at it\u00c2 from the right angle, the hood had exactly the same lines as my XJ. And each new Jag was better. The new XJ is a bit weird, but majestic in its weirdness. The F-Type is maybe even prettier than the E-Type. The new XE is probably the most fetching\u00c2 compact executive sedan on the market. And the new XF looks even better than this one.\n\nIn theory, the XF 2.0d should be a perfect executive sedan in many ways. It's one of the most gorgeous, leanest and most sporty-looking cars in its class. Being Jaguar, it should pamper you with a compliant suspension, yet offer great handling at the same time. But\u00c2 does it really work as it should?\n\nThe first thing I noticed when behind the XF's wheel was\u00c2 how different the new cabin feels. While the old XF was quite roomy and airy, the new car feels tight and cozy and quite a bit sportier. It's true that all the first-generation sedans\u00c2 I sat in had beige interiors and this one is black, but the difference is deeper than color. The car is lower inside and, while you have enough space in all directions, it feels like it was tailored tightly around you.\n\nSomeone at Jaguar remembered the old, second-generation XJs \u00e2\u0080\" the XJ40, and especially the X300 and X308 of the 1990s \u00e2\u0080\" and decided to inject a bit of that\u00c2 soul into the new XF. Some of it's the\u00c2 details \u00e2\u0080\" like the window between the C and D pillars. More crucially,\u00c2 the XF\u00c2 seems to be designed from the outside in, with good looks and a lean profile prioritized over\u00c2 space for people, but not so much that space is lacking. It's a far cry from a Mercedes E-Class or BMW 5 Series, but you can fit grown adults in the back behind grown adults sitting in the front. That\u00c2 was not always the case with cars like the X308 XJR.\n\nNaturally, you'd expect the XF to offer a\u00c2 sporty drive. After all, Jaguar is now\u00c2 aimed toward\u00c2 BMW's abandoned\u00c2 driver's car\u00c2 niche, which the Bavarian automaker vacated in pursuit of becoming a luxury lifestyle brand that builds 500-horsepower executive golf carts. Your expectations are nothing if not fulfilled. As\u00c2 I left\u00c2 town to\u00c2 head into the hills, the Jag behaved almost exactly as anticipated. It was not as compliant and comfortable as my old XJ, but neither were\u00c2 XJs from '90s. The XF's suspension could\u00c2 even be considered taut, and only became\u00c2 jittery once the speedo hit\u00c2 triple digits of miles per hour.\n\nMost importantly, though, the XF feels light-footed and agile in the twisties, and\u00c2 much smaller than the current BMW 5 series (F10) or Audi A6. There's no comparing the current E-Class to the Jag \u00e2\u0080\" and based on experience with the current C220d, there's no reason to think the upcoming W213 E-Class will be any more of a driver's car.\n\nIf you want an executive sedan that's also a rewarding car to drive in a spirited manner; if you prefer sleek looks to interior space; if you're willing to forgo some of the Germanic gadgets and latest tech, the XF is the perfect car for you. It's everything classic Jaguars were, and, in a way, it serves to fill the BMW's old position, while BMW itself is trying to become something else altogether. Cadillac, I guess.\n\nNow, you are probably wondering why I am doing European review of a first diesel Jaguar to come to American shores, and not mention the fuel-sipping miracle of an engine? Well, it's because I am not really eager to even remember it, much less talk about it. But I will, now. And it won't be pretty.\n\nThe 2.0d engine with 180 horsepower (a 163 hp version is also available in Europe) is part of the new Ingenium engine family, which makes the engine\u00c2 even more disappointing. Before driving the XF, I didn't do my homework, and came out of the car certain the diesel\u00c2 was an\u00c2 old boat anchor borrowed from a 10-year-old\u00c2 Ford Mondeo Estate. It wasn't. This engine is one of the cornerstones supporting the hopes and dreams of Jaguar's future.\n\nAnd it doesn't really work. On paper, it looks great. On the road, as long as you're just put-putting around, it's okay. But push the pedal harder, and you're reminded that this cat drinks diesel. The 180 hp diesel isn't exactly a powerhouse, and it feels a bit strained to move the massive, aluminum-bodied XF around. Even if the engine was superbly refined, much\u00c2 of the joy from driving the big cat would be lost as you can't exploit its\u00c2 great chassis to its full potential.\n\nBut the real trouble is that the engine lacks anything resembling\u00c2 refinement. Not in the not-refined-enough-for-a-premium-executive-car\u00c2 sense, either. When I switched to a Volkswagen\u00c2 Touran 2.0 TDI later that day, I found that \u00e2\u0080\" while its engine may be killing fluffy animals all day long \u00e2\u0080\" it sounds smooth and relatively quiet. The XF 2.0d is slightly coarse in normal, relaxed driving and gets more\u00c2 clattery when pushed. In comparison, a Mazda6 2.2d is quick, effortless and sounds lovely.\n\nThis won't be a\u00c2 great problem for many European drivers. Here, the 178 hp diesel is powerful enough to perform\u00c2 most daily duties without digging too deep into its\u00c2 power and rpm levels that induce the noise. But Americans drive differently and use a lot more power. Jaguar's diesel may clatter it to death.\n\nOverall, the XF is a great car, but if I could only afford it with 2.0d engine, I'd probably just buy the aforementioned Mazda6 or Fusion/Mondeo instead. The 2.0-litre XF diesel is a frustrating experience. Every time you start it, it reminds you that you were too cheap to buy a proper, six-cylinder Jag.\n\n[Images: Viola Proch\u00c3\u00a1zkov\u00c3\u00a1/The Truth About Cars]", "From The Car Connection:\n\nHonda Civic Vs.

I've never ridden a bike perfect for the twisties and urban settings that could also do freeway stints without brutalizing my body into a painkiller addiction. Then I finally got to throw a leg over the 701.\n\nI am amazed by this bike, and I couldn't wait to tell you how good it is.\n\n(Full Disclosure: Husqvarna wanted me to ride the 701 Supermoto so bad, they invited me to ride one from their office in Murrieta to Anza Borrego. When I told them I needed more time on it, they kindly obliged and let me borrow it for a week.)\n\nHusqvarna has an odd history in the motorcycle world. With a few incredible off-road machines and a little help from this guy named Steve McQueen, it has a huge heritage. Unfortunately, in the past few decades it's wavered between going under completely and being passed around like the smelly kid at daycare.\n\nBMW bought Husqvarna from Cagiva MV Agusta in 2007, which we all assumed was a move to fill out their dirt offerings. BMW went a different route, taking them on road as basically rebadged BMW F 650 GSs. They were bad. Really bad.\n\nIn 2013, BMW sold Husky to Pierer Industrie AG, the holding company owned by KTM CEO Stefen Pierer. They dropped the silly Terra and the quality of their dirtbikes shot up, as they re-launched with basically just rebadged KTMs.\n\nhttp://lanesplitter.jalopnik.com/how-one-design...\n\nEven though the 701 Supermoto looks to be just a rebadged KTM 690 SMC, it's actually Husqvarna's first (mostly) originally-designed motorcycle since coming under new ownership. Sure, it's the same motor and shares a lot of the same geometry as the KTM, but Husky's designers took some building blocks and what was working on the KTM and made it better. Not an all new bike, designed from the ground up, but a good start.\n\nThe 701 Supermoto uses the engine from the KTM 690 SMC supermoto, which is a single cylinder, 690 cc single overhead cam motor. Where it differs from the KTM is in the throttle bodies and fuel mapping, where Husky played with the timing to smooth the throttle response and decrease vibrations. The 701 makes 67 horsepower at 7,000 RPM and 49.4 pound-feet of torque at 6,500 RPM.\n\nThe bike has a ride-by-wire throttle and comes stock with three fuel maps: standard, soft, and advanced, and also has a \"bad\" fuel map available for when you decide to ride in far off lands with less than ideal gas.\n\nThe 701 Supermoto comes with a slipper clutch standard, which means the pull on the clutch is 50% easier and also further removed from the vibrations of the bike. It also means the rear wheel won't chatter, chirp, or hop when you downshifting aggressively -- which is going to happen a lot.\n\nThe rear subframe is also new, and Husky went with a plastic unit to help save weight. The 3.4 gallon tank is integrated into the tail, as are the passenger handles, but the entire unit still only weighs 11.5 pounds.\n\nSuspension comes in the form of a WP closed cartridge 4cs front fork and WP read monoshock with linkage, which is nicer that the ones on the KTM 690. It has 275 mm (10.8 inches) of travel front and rear and is fully adjustable for spring preload and compression/rebound damping adjustments adjustments.\n\nTo help slow you down, the 701 Supermoto comes with a single, 320 mm disc up front with a Brembo four-piston, radially fixed caliper. Out back sits a 240 mm disc with a Brembo single piston, floating caliper. Also included is Bosch's 9.1 MP ABS system which can be turned off. Or, for those of you who really like to push your hooligan riding, an optional dongle will let you turn off the ABS only at the rear. Because sliding.\n\nFinally, and while this may seem trivial and silly, one of the specs that plays a huge role in this bike's being so good is that they've mounted the triple clamp with a thick rubber, which greatly reduces vibrations at the bars. When I asked for your questions on the bike, most of you asked about vibrations. We'll get more into those questions, but they vibes are drastically reduced.\n\nThe 701 Supermoto and 701 Enduro will be in dealerships soon, and will retail for $11,299. They say they're only bringing in a limited number this year, so get your deposits in early if you haven't already.\n\nI'm a big fan of supermotos, which means I'm also acutely aware that there is nothing available today that is really worth buying. I love the DR-Z, but they just take so much work to get them to actually be able to go fast, and even then they aren't that fast. Even when KTM did offer the 690 SMC here in the U.S., it was too big too be a true race bike while not refined enough to be a great every day bike.\n\nThe Husky checked a lot of boxes, but dating has taught me that good on paper and good for day to day life can be very different things.\n\nBut the Husky delivered. Immediately. Within the first 10 miles, I knew the 710 was something special. It's a very similar size to the Suzuki DR-Z400SM supermoto, with both weighing 320 pounds and having 35 inch seat heights - but has more than double the power.\n\nFrom go, fueling is spot on. Even in the \"advanced\" fuel map (which is changed under the seat), there's no abruptness between off and on fueling and the bike pulls hard until just before the rev limiter kicks in.\n\nWhile you'd think that much power in a package that small might be really difficult to handle, the six speed gearbox is spaced perfectly for the bike. Many of us like the closer gearing of the Enduro in the tight stuff, because we're dumb and want everything turned to 11, but cooler heads agree the gearing is spot on. That huge thumper means you don't have to gear it super low to have enough power at the bottom, and the additional space up top is vital for making this bike appropriate for day to day riding.\n\nIt also means that you can ride it like a real street bike, playing in the middle of the rev range rather than making your next shift as soon as you've completed the last one (as you do on the DR-Z). Even better, that tall gearing (along with the rubber mounted bars and refined fuel mapping) means you don't feel like you're revving the guts out of the bike on the freeway.\n\nI did 50 miles of Southern California freeways at So Cal freeway speeds (85 plus) and didn't feel like I was stressing the bike more than I did my old 2010 Triumph Bonneville. At normal freeway speeds (70 mph), the bike cruises along in ease.\n\nOnce I'd finished that long trek riding up to Malibu's tightest and twistiest, it was time for real fun to start -- and the Husky was more than happy to oblige. It was here that the 701 really cemented itself as maybe the best bike on the market for public road pounding.\n\nThe front fork was set up near perfectly for my weight (on roads with lots of imperfections), and the side to side transitions are insanely fast. The front gets a tad shaky coming out of corners on the gas as the front end wants to lift but, besides that, the 701 is planted no matter how far you lean.\n\nThat big Brembo front and slipper clutch kept things settled as I came screaming into the tighest turns Malibu had to offer, and the fueling made applying throttle out of them drama free and gave me confidence to push harder. Then, on parts of road like the fast section of Mulholland, the gearing and strong mid range power helped me chase down liter bikes well into triple digit speeds through the sweepers.\n\nThe 701 Supermoto put such a stupid grin on my face, partly because it's a supermoto hooligan bike and that's what they do, but also because it really lets me focus on being a better rider. It gives you all the tools you need to go fast, but doesn't need to be ridden hard to work or be good. It's so consistent in how it responds to inputs, that it lets you stop worrying about what it might do and focus on the next corner's apex or your body positioning -- even on your first day on it.\n\nI've never been great at wheelies because binning a press bike learning to show off is not a good way to keep a job. But the 701 is so predictable and makes it so easy that, by the end of the day, I refused to keep the front end down.\n\nAll of this isn't to say that the Husqvarna 701 Supermoto is completely perfect out of the box or that we wouldn't change a thing. It's just really close.\n\nThe first things to go would be the stupid mirrors and seat. The mirrors hit me in the helmet anytime I was really hanging off the bike, and the seat is sort of slippery and shaped in a way that made any sort of decent mileage day pretty uncomfortable. Seat Concepts does a seat for the DRZ that's absolutely incredible and should be added to every Dizzer out there, and hopefully they'll have an option for the Husky soon.\n\nThe ABS system on the bike works really well (thanks, guy who pulled cross the double yellow lines into the carpool lane on the freeway!), but I would love more stopping power up front and noticed some significant brake fade after my long day of canyon riding. If this were my bike, I'd be eyeball deep into some dual disc options on Thumpertalk.com.\n\nBesides the brake fade, the only other problem I had was with false neutrals. I hit a lot of them, mostly when upshifting sans the clutch.\n\nHusky has a great range of accessories, and the Akropovic exhaust system, ABS dongle ($109.99), skid plate, and graphics kit would also find their way onto a permanent bike - because they're awesome. I'd also add a steering damper.\n\nI posted a pic of the bike on those social medias the teens are always talking about and asked what your questions were about the bike so I could help tailor the review to what you wanted to know. If you aren't following me on Instagram or Twitter, you really should be. I try and keep the food and cat pics to a minimum.\n\nIf I were a wealthy man (which I will never be as long as I work for the Internet), I'd have a Husqvarna 701 Supermoto, Ducati 959 Panigale, and Honda Africa Twin in the garage -- and I'd do 90 percent of my riding on the Husky. (Okay, and a Husky FE 350 S, Yamaha YZ250F, and KTM 1290 Super Duke GT).\n\nThis bike just does so many things well, I can honestly say I think it's worth the relatively high price of $11,300. Is that a lot for a single cylinder supermoto? Sure. But, for this bike it's totally worth it.\n\nIt's honestly amazing that, in an age when so many brands are unable to create a production bike with decent fueling, Husqvarna can nail it with such a torquey thumper. Great fueling, great handling, incredible motor, relatively low vibes, nice brakes, and low weight? On something that will make my commute fun instead of miserable? And that I can spend countless hours hooning in the canyons? SIGN. ME. UP.\n\nUnfortunately, Husqvarna says they're still working on expanding their dealer network. They're done pairing Husqvarna with KTM, so looking for other shops has been a struggle. As such, the nice Husky man (capitalization counts, people) said they weren't bringing many 701s into the States this year. I think it's time we demanded more.\n\nI haven't had the chance to take it to the track, but can promise you that's on my list -- for science's sake. I can also promise you that if you ask me what bike you should buy, I'm going to tell you this one.", "DETROIT -- As the Takata air bag saga drags on, concerns are growing that tens of millions of US drivers with cars that haven't been recalled could be at risk of death or injury from the potentially defective devices.\n\nFederal safety regulators last month confirmed that a South Carolina man's death in December was caused by a driver's air bag inflator that wasn't under recall. It was the ninth Takata-related fatality in the US.\n\nIn a Feb. 10 letter to Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., urged the agency to recall all Takata inflators in U.S. cars. He said the agency's current approach of issuing recalls piecemeal, \"appears to be confusing many consumers\" who wonder if their cars have an unsafe air bag that hasn't been recalled.\n\nSince 2008, 14 automakers have recalled 24 million vehicles to replace the inflators, which can rupture in a crash, shooting metal shards at the driver and passengers.\n\nExperts say there could be as many as 50 million Takata air bag inflators in cars that have yet to be called back for repairs. For drivers of those vehicles, finding out if their car has a Takata inflator can be tricky. They either have to convince a dealer to take apart the car to look, or get the automaker to tell them. Some, like General Motors and Ford, won't tell. Nissan and Toyota won't say if they will disclose a Takata inflator. Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Mercedes and BMW say they'll tell if asked.\n\nNHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge says the agency doesn't have the data yet to justify a recall of every Takata inflator. The agency has given Takata until the end of 2018 to solve the problem or issue a blanket recall. Takata says it continues to investigate the cause; NHTSA and the auto industry also have investigations under way.\n\nThe death of Joel Knight, 52, underscores how perplexing the search for a solution is. On Dec. 22, Knight's 2006 Ford Ranger struck a cow on a rural road near his home in Kershaw, South Carolina. He died after metal fragments from the driver's inflator impaled his neck. According to a law firm representing Knight's family, the crash was moderate and otherwise survivable.\n\nNHTSA says Knight's driver air bag hadn't been recalled because tests on hundreds of inflators like the one used in his Ranger did not show any failures. The passenger air bag had been recalled.\n\nKnight's death fits into one prevailing theory about the cause of the ruptures: his truck was an older model, and spent a long period of time in a region with high humidity.\n\nTakata is nearly alone among inflator makers in using the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion that inflates the bags in a crash. Tests show that over time, high temperatures and humidity can degrade the chemical, causing it to explode with too much force, rupturing a metal canister that's supposed to contain the explosion. The pieces can hit a car's occupants.\n\nInitially, the recalls targeted older vehicles along the Gulf Coast, and NHTSA has ordered that dealers in those areas receive the bulk of replacement inflators as they're made. But the latest recall from Volkswagen includes cars from 2014, and a recent Honda recall has a 2016 model.\n\n\"Recent events and recalls involving relatively new vehicles with these types of inflators raise serious questions as to whether Takata's ammonium nitrate propellant is inherently dangerous,\" Nelson wrote to Rosekind. \"I am concerned that the current approach may be needlessly incremental and fail to adequately protect public safety.\"\n\nScott Upham, who runs a Rochester, New York, research firm that tracks air bag sales, estimates there are 50 million unrecalled Takata inflators on U.S. roads today.\n\nUntil they're all recalled and fixed \"people are going to keep dying,\" he says.\n\nTakata maintains that most of its inflators are safe, but says it agreed with government demands to stop making those with ammonium nitrate by 2018 - except for inflators with a drying agent.\n\nAll of the deaths have been caused by driver's inflators, and NHTSA's Trowbridge says all but a few thousand of those without a chemical added to keep them dry have been recalled. That means most of the unrecalled inflators are on the passenger side, where there have been fewer serious injuries.\n\nStill, the piecemeal approach to recalls has allowed the population of Takata inflators to grow so large that a total recall wouldn't immediately fix the problem because replacements can't be manufactured fast enough.\n\nTakata says it and other suppliers can make up to 1.5 million replacement inflators per month, meaning up to 18 million a year. But some of those must go to other countries, where about 30 million more inflators are being recalled.\n\nIn the US, it would take about four years to replace inflators now under recall.\n\nSo far, automakers have replaced about 5 million inflators. That low rate is due both to the limited number of inflators and to an issue common to most recalls: People don't take their cars in for repairs, even with a problem this serious.\n\nTwo other senators want to make sure everyone with a Takata inflator can get a replacement.\n\nSens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, in a separate letter this month, asked NHTSA to recall all the inflators and force Takata to publish all makes and models for which it has supplied air bags since 2000. The public also should be allowed to see inflator test results, they said.\n\n\"Every consumer deserves to know whether their vehicle could be lethal in a fender-bender,\" the senators wrote.", "General Motos is recalling about 200,000 Saab and Saturn cars in the U.S. and Canada to replace the Takata driver's air bag inflators.\n\nThe GM recall includes the Saab 9-3 from 2003 to 2011 and the Saab 5 from 2010 and 2011. Also included is the Saturn Astra from 2008 and 2009.\n\nFederal safety regulators last month confirmed that a South Carolina man's death in December was caused by a driver's air bag inflator that wasn't under recall. It was the ninth Takata-related fatality in the U.S.\n\nIn a Feb. 10 letter to Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Sen. Bill Nelson, Democrat-Florida., urged the agency to recall all Takata inflators in U.S. cars. He said the agency's current approach of issuing recalls piecemeal, \"appears to be confusing many consumers\" who wonder if their cars have an unsafe air bag that hasn't been recalled.\n\nSince 2008, 14 automakers have recalled 24 million vehicles to replace the inflators, which can rupture in a crash, shooting metal shards at the driver and passengers.\n\nExperts say there could be as many as 50 million Takata air bag inflators in cars that have yet to be called back for repairs. For drivers of those vehicles, finding out if their car has a Takata inflator can be tricky. They either have to convince a dealer to take apart the car to look, or get the automaker to tell them. Some, like General Motors and Ford, won't tell. Nissan and Toyota won't say if they will disclose a Takata inflator. Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Mercedes and BMW say they'll tell if asked.\n\nNHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge says the agency doesn't have the data yet to justify a recall of every Takata inflator. The agency has given Takata until the end of 2018 to solve the problem or issue a blanket recall. Takata says it continues to investigate the cause; NHTSA and the auto industry also have investigations under way.\n\nThe death of Joel Knight, 52, underscores how perplexing the search for a solution is. On Dec. 22, Knight's 2006 Ford Ranger struck a cow on a rural road near his home in Kershaw, South Carolina. He died after metal fragments from the driver's inflator impaled his neck. According to a law firm representing Knight's family, the crash was moderate and otherwise survivable.\n\nNHTSA says Knight's driver air bag hadn't been recalled because tests on hundreds of inflators like the one used in his Ranger did not show any failures. The passenger air bag had been recalled. Knight's death fits into one prevailing theory about the cause of the ruptures: his truck was an older model, and spent a long period of time in a region with high humidity.", "Aston Martin could soon be teaming up with mysterious Chinese automotive firm Faraday Future to develop an electric supercar.\n\nThe British brand, which is best known for being James Bond's ride of choice, recently announced a partnership with Faraday Future's backer, LeEco.\n\nThe deal will see the firms develop the RapidE S electric sports saloon in 2018 - a prototype version of which was unveiled in October.\n\nThe firms said the partnership could also lead to the development of other electric cars with Faraday Future, who has also said it will unveil a road-ready car 'very soon'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAston Martin, which is best known for being James Bond's ride of choice, has announced a partnership with Faraday Future's backer, LeEco.

MONICA KREBER/JOURNAL SCENE\n\nDavid Manzi's father, John, is a huge proponent of decreasing his carbon footprint.\n\nManzi said his father, who lives on Folly Beach, drives an electric BMW and put solar panels up on his house in the last year.\n\nSeeing his father do it, Manzi thought maybe he could put some panels up on his Summerville business and sell some energy back to SCE&G.\n\nManzi is owner of Cirque Salon Studios on Bacons Bridge Road. He and his father are joint partners in the building. Manzi is using the building's flat roof to accommodate 78 solar panels to sell electricity back to SCE&G on a monthly basis.\n\nEdgewater Energy Services is installing the panels.\n\nGinny Jones, senior public affairs specialist with SCANA, said this will be the first commercial solar customer in Summerville to participate in one of the new Distributer Energy Resources Programs that were launched last fall.\n\nThe programs are incentives developed to encourage customers to install solar panels at their homes or businesses.\n\nJones stated in an e-mail that since launching the incentive programs last fall, SCE&G has seen a \"significant increase\" in customers who are interested in solar panels.\n\nThe panels will occupy 6,200 square feet on the roof above the salon portion of the building, which has a higher roof. There are plans to use the entire roof, which could be covered with an estimated 170 panels, but Manzi has decided to start by putting panels up just over the salon.\n\nIn a couple of weeks he will start selling energy back to SCE&G every month. Manzi will still get his monthly electric bill, which he said runs close to $3,000 a month. Selling the energy back to SCE&G will not make an immediate profit. In probably about three to four years Manzi expects to start to break even, but further down the road Manzi should start to make some money off the panels, he said.\n\nIt's not just about making a profit, though.\n\n\"It helps that it makes money but it's nice that I'm also able to make it a green initiative,\" he said.\n\nCirque Salon Studios' big flat roof will allow maximum exposure to the sun, he said. The panels sit in weighted down cradles and can withstand up to 120-mile-per-hour winds.\n\nEdgewater Energy is based in North Charleston. Kevin Crout, owner and partner at Edgewater Energy, said his business has kept busy with residential installations for solar panels.\n\nCrout said they have had customers shave as much as half off their electric bill. A handful do not have to pay a bill, he said.\n\nWith Manzi's business, Crout said Edgewater is excited to finish installing the panels and seeing their potential.\n\n\"We hope to do a lot more in the future,\" he said.\n\nManzi is excited about the new venture. \"It's really exciting to be doing this,\" he said. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to one, become a little greener, and two, it's a business venture, too.\"\n\nManzi said he is hopeful to start a trend among other businesses in the area.\n\n\"There's so many buildings like this around here,\" he said. \"I hope that people utilize it and start doing something.\""], "2016-02-18": ["Topping the sales charts is often a huge priority for automakers, but how far would they go to achieve this goal? According to Bloomberg, BMW aggressively sold cars to its dealerships last year, a strategy that helped it win the luxury sales crown.\n\nIn December, BMW shelled out as much as $1,750 for every new model it gave to dealer service fleets. These vehicles were given out as loaners to customers waiting for their BMW models to be serviced. And while other automakers have these services, some experts say BMW has pushed its loaner program particularly far to help meet sales goals. And without those extra sales, BMW may not have scored the win.\n\nBMW narrowly edged out Lexus to remain the top-selling luxury carmaker in the U.S. last year. It sold just 1,400 more vehicles than Lexus and almost 3,000 more cars than Mercedes-Benz, according to Autodata. Of course, BMW's strategy with loaner vehicles comes with other perks. Because dealers refresh their loaner fleets frequently, they have the chance to show off their most up-to-date products. According to BMW spokesman Kenn Sparks, the loaner program is \"an important part of BMW's customer-satisfaction plan.\"\n\nAfter a while, the vehicles go out of service and sell at a heavy discount. As another tactic that could have helped BMW achieve its sales goals, the automaker spent more on consumer incentives than rival companies in December. BMW slashed prices by an average of $5,169 per vehicle on discounted lease deals and rebates, which is $1,400 more than Lexus and $600 more than Mercedes-Benz provided.\n\nClick HERE to read the full report.\n\nSource: Bloomberg", "BMW appears to be expanding its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, taking direct aim at Car2Go in one of its most successful markets.\n\nGeekWire readers spotted the BMW cars in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood this week, signaling that the test program is now under way.\n\nResponding to GeekWire's inquiry, DriveNow did not directly address questions about the size and status of the Seattle test.\n\n\"BMW remains dedicated to solving the many transportation challenges faced by major cities - and interested in mobility services such as car sharing,\" a spokeswoman said via email. \"We are currently exploring the potential to work with a number of U.S. cities who are welcoming car sharing in their communities and offering the parking permits necessary to operate one-way flexible car sharing.\"\n\nSaw dozens of @BMWiUSA cars in Seattle this morning.

Its white and blue mini vehicles are spotted on many city streets, and last year the company announced citywide expansion plans that included adding another 250 vehicles.\n\nThat expansion was enabled by legislation approved by the Seattle City Council in January 2015, which also cleared the way for up to three additional companies to launch car-sharing services in the city. Each car-sharing company can receive 500 permits to start, and up to 750 if they agree to provide service across the city.\n\nIn 2014, Car2Go said that Seattle was its largest market with more than 59,000 registered members.

It's also an utter hooligan if you toss the car sideways and stab the throttle, something two of England's rugby players recently found out.Earlier this month, BMW U.K. challenged two rugby stars, Kieran Brookes and Tom Wood, to a game: Who can throw a rugby ball through the window of a sliding, drifting, tire-squealing M3 while it circles the two players? BMW wanted to find of whether the players, \"have the speed and accuracy to cope with the sheer power of the BMW M3?\"At first, the rugby players have a bit of trouble getting the timing down, but after a few more tries, and some rough-housing with each other, the two get their eyes in, and they start sinking the balls in the window.

For 2016, the American automaker shakes off some of the age by injecting some mechanical improvements into what was already a competent coupe. The lines that follow narrate the best, worst and par scores of the revised American executive car.\n\nDESIGN & AESTHETICS\n\nWhat is the ATS Coupe? For those in their youthful 20s and 30s, Cadillac has created a two-door vehicle out of their ?very-accomplished compact four-door ATS sedan - essentially making this a luxury compact coupe. By borrowing the pointy geometry from the ATS sedan and the same 2,776mm wheelbase, the coupe was bound to be a handsome proposition and it is. We do admit, though, that it's hard to distinguish the coupe from the sedan and that it takes a moment before your eyes realise that two doors are missing. Truth is, both formats feature unique bodywork - the roof, doors, front and rear fenders, and the trunk lid are all different in both cars.\n\nThe bevel-edge creative direction first seen on the Evoq concept, exhibited way back in 1999, has been carried forward in this 2016 ATS coupe. Good news is, it's able to maintain great distinction in a road crowded by Beemers, Mercs and Audis. The Coupe is the first production model to wear Cadillac's revised emblem that abandons the laurel wreath for a contemporary-styled shield. Illuminations at the front end - even in base models - feature HID xenon lamps and pulled-back LED vertical strip lighting. The rear too has similar vertical LED taillamps in a shade of red. The lack of a B-pillar would have been nice - it would have negated some of the blind spot effect while making the car look cooler. Paint choices are many, and Cadillac has added three new schemes: Cocoa Bronze, Moonstone and a new Black.\n\nThe coupe stays afloat on multi-spoke 18\" wheels, and exhaust duties at the rear end are carried out by large dual tail pipes that inform onlookers of the power under the hood, through visual and aural expression. We are of the opinion ?that if you are looking for a distinct sports coupe with balanced proportions, the ATS may be the car for you.\n\nOpen up the door with the smart access that releases the locks on the illuminated door handles - the only one of its kind. In case you haven't noticed, in most other cars, it the underside of the handle that is illuminated.\n\nSlip inside the comfortably low-slung body and you enter an expanse of American-built luxury. Cadillac has taken the usual suspects of supple leather upholstery, soft touch materials and some non-obvious elements such as the futuristic glossy glass centre-stack to give it the mandated upmarket feel.\n\nThe coupe's inherent sporting persona is evident in the ?good driving position it provides. Individuals around the 180cm mark can be seated comfortably; plus, whether you like a relaxed slide back driving position or an upright aggressive posture, this Cadillac will deliver. The front seats with their many power commands for adjustments provide a good compromise between racecar seating and overly plush Ameri-can seats.\n\nThe sportiness is further accentuated with a tactility of the beefy steering wheel. The three-spoke rim, with its decorative piano black trims, houses all the multi-functionality one could need, including audio controls and cruise control. Placed behind the rim are genuine metal paddle shifters in an almost gun metal finish - and true metal shifters are not something you see often; even Audi uses plastic bits.\n\nThe backdrop to the steering wheel consists of well-laid out gauges that score high on User Interface (UI) quotient with its legible fonts and easy-on-the-eye lighting. It is coupled with a customisable 5.7\" display and a full-colour heads-up display. As you press the little starter button - finished in an off-putting plastic chrome - the gauges come alive and do a little dance before they settle down to their respective zeros and idles.\n\nThe head unit in the ATS infotainment system - CUE or Cadillac User Experience - is something to write home about. The 8\" LCD screen is sizable but the touch-sensitive screen faces issues with response and reception. Cadillac say that the usability has been revised for 2016 and, while we did find it marginally easier to use, it could simply have been that we, as auto-journos, are now accustomed to the system, which may not be the case for new users. The screen has all the smart phone-inspired pinch-swipe functionality, but the unresponsive nature reigns. Concealed under the retractable screen is a 1.8L storage area that is equipped with sufficient sto-rage. The non-obvious loca-tion makes it a good place to hide stuff. The ATS Coupe is a 2+2-seater, and four adults can be seated in relative com-fort. Entering the rear cabin is a tad tricky, but the space itself is accommodating.\n\nPOWERTRAIN & PERFORMANCE\n\nAlthough there are a variety of powertrains in the GM lineup, like a 2.5L motor and the 2L turbo, GM chose to equip all GCC-spec coupes with the racy direct-injection 3.6L V6 - a good thing, considering the motor shares great enthusiasm for revs all the way to the redline, and is smooth in operation.\n\nThe responsive six-pot is linked to a Hydra-Matic 8L45 8-speed automatic trans-mission. Besides allowing drivers to eke the most out of the engine, the 'tap-shift' control, with its two glossy dark chrome paddle shifters, also keeps you involved.\n\nHook the car up to a dyna-mometer and run its paces; the ATS Coupe should confirm the company-claimed maximum horsepower rating of 318bhp at the crank available at 6,800 rpm and a healthy dose of torque; i.e., 373Nm, available at a mid-counter of 4,800rpm.\n\nSome may argue that the turbocharged 3.0-litre engines on compatriots like ?the BMW 435i or Audi's A5 allow their cars to be quicker, but truth is: the performance deficit is minimal and in a real life driving situation, the difference is unperceived. Cadillac claims the ATS coupe will clock the 0-100km/h sprint in 5.6 seconds. And with the bounty of torque available across the rev-counter, overtaking manoeuvres on the highway are of little concern as well. With the ?gas pedal pushed down firmly, the engine - in combination with the exhausts pipes - provide a progressive, yet aggressive aural note, which to us sounded like a feel-good tune all day.\n\nThe Coupe borrows the chassis from the highly acclaimed ATS sedan chassis, which shone greatly in our hands on the Yas Marina circuit, a couple of years ago at the ATS launch. The even spread of mass helps it achieve the optimum 50:50 weight distribution, while the low centre of gravity gives it a very neutral balance, making this car a joy to drive quick. All credits to the dynamically balanced suspension setup! Although the prim and proper looks advertise a composed driving demeanour, the ATS, with its wholesome power and rear wheel drive, is very capable of lunacy. With some throttle application and a twisted steering input, the rear will step out quite easily. You should also know that the driver-adjustable FE3 sport suspension that includes Magnetic Ride Control measures road conditions 1,000 times a second, and adjusts the damping in real time. How many cars are capable of that?\n\nOn the down side, the ride did comes across as appreciably bumpy, especially in low speeds when you roll over a speed hump. Thankfully, the performance is backed by a good set of brakes that con-sists of ventilated disc all around, with 12.6\" and 12.4\" rotors, front and rear, respectively.\n\nWhen a company places a middle-weight engine such as this 3.6L V6, they are compelled to provide inspiring performance and care for the owner's expenses and the ecology at the same time. With the newly integrated systems like Active Fuel Management (which is basically cylinder deactivation) and Stop/Start technology, fuel economy has been improved by a claimed nine per cent overall. So, expect a figure a little better than 8.4L/100km on the highway and 13.4 in the city. You should also see some improvement for the CO2 emission rating.\n\nFEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY\n\nA big part of posing as a luxury vehicle is a manu-facturer's commitment to making life easier and more convenient for the owners and the occupants - and the ATS coupe fulfils that to a great extent.\n\nWhile the CUE touch panel interface lacks response, it does make up with function-ality. You get Bluetooth connectivity for your phone and audio, as well as voice operation and text-to-voice that converts incoming text messages to speech. The 12-speaker Bose audio unit is a good music box, but we think a certain degree of acoustic balancing remains. Also available are USB ?ports, auxiliary input and SD memory card ports.\n\nThe ATS Coupe has plenty of safety features like Alert Seat, Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and Lane Keep Assist, front and rear park assist, rear-vision camera, eight standard air bags, safety belt pre-tensioners, adaptive cruise control, blind zone alert, and rear cross traffic alert. But we recommend that maintaining a good relationship with the brakes whilst keeping an eye out for traffic would be a good idea at all times. as with any other car.\n\nComfort conditions are maintained by the dual zone climate control. Owning a coupe, you may have a cause for concern in the luggage department. Thankfully, the ATS Coupe offers as much as 295L of trunk space, which is plenty for a full-size suitcase and then some.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe 2016 Cadillac ATS Coupe 3.6 is an adept luxury coupe that has been ?styled for distinction whilst providing a generous serving of horsepower under the hood and a balanced chassis to test the high-levels of traction and your courage. The CUE system could be improved, but everything is eight-tenth of what you need. Plus, with Cadillac's Premium Care package, you are backed by a four-year/100,000km warranty and four years of scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance.", "SANTA CLARA, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 02/18/16 -- In a car dealership, responsiveness means the difference between a service appointment, a large-ticket sale, or customers taking their business elsewhere.

A Mercedes-Benz spokesman said the lawsuit had no merit and that the company would vigorously defend against it.\n\nDiesel has been promoted as a more fuel-efficient alternative to gasoline-powered cars. But auto makers sold 3,500 diesel cars in U.S. last September, and sales fell below 800 in each of the subsequent three months. Volkswagen's U.S. sales halt cut demand, but low gasoline prices and worries about diesel pollution also played roles.\n\nThere were 222 diesel-powered cars sold in the U.S. in January, a sharp decline from the 4,448 sold in the same period a year ago. January's U.S. sales were about a third of the 631 sold in December. Diesel car sales for 2015 peaked in May, when 9,300 were sold.\n\nIn the U.S., diesel-powered passenger vehicles are mostly bought for work-related pickup trucks or vans and haven't been as widely embraced as in Europe for sedans. WardsAuto.com reported strong demand for diesel in light trucks through the crisis, reflecting a wider migration among buyers to heavier vehicles.\n\nJoseph Gunther IV, general manager of Gunther Volkswagen in Delray Beach, Fla., said his customers are no longer asking for diesels, and the shift to gasoline-powered Volkswagen is leading to shortages of certain models.\n\nVolkswagen has been trying to provider its larger dealers with more inventory, but that shift also hurts availability of gasoline-powered cars for smaller dealers. Mr. Gunther said he is running low on a variety of models.\n\nThe overall decline in diesel-powered sedans was somewhat offset by truck demand until January, when volumes of both cars and trucks with diesel engines fell. Auto makers sold 21,999 diesel light-trucks in January, a 16% decline compared with the same month in 2005.\n\nVolkswagen has been one of the biggest advocates of diesel technology for sedans, coupes and compact cars, representing about 80% of the diesel passenger car volume. German rivals BMW AG BMW -0.05 % and Mercedes-Benz continue to offer diesel cars, but the extremely small number of diesel car sales reported in January shows Volkswagen's influence on that market.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. GM -0.82 % sold a diesel-powered Chevy Cruze compact in the U.S. for a short time. It also offers diesel versions of its light trucks. A spokeswoman said it hasn't sold a diesel Cruze in the U.S. since May 2015.\n\nPatrick Min, senior analyst for Internet car-shopping site TrueCar Inc., TRUE -2.20 % said light trucks will remain the largest user of diesel engines in the U.S.\n\nThere are a \"growing number of light-duty trucks offering diesel,\" he said, including Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -1.73 % and additional GM models.\n\nMr. Min said low gas prices also \"temper demand for diesel passenger cars...diesel can be a 20% to 25% premium at the pump.\"\n\nWrite to Jeff Bennett at jeff.bennett@wsj.com", "BMW M2 is the talk of the town this week.

Before the M2, if you wanted the best-performing BMW M coupe, you had to get the BMW M4. It was just the pinnacle of BMW's performance. However, there were many that felt it was too heavy, too big and not as sharp as previous M3s. For that reason, the BMW M2 was so hotly anticipated, as most fans felt as if it would be the answer to all of the problems they had with the M4.\n\nNow that it's here, and we can take a look at both cars, which customers better suited for the M2 and which are better suited for the M4?\n\nThe BMW M2 and M4 share some similar DNA, but they're pretty different cars. The brand-new BMW M2 is much smaller, has less power and is slower than the BMW M4. It's also around $10,000 cheaper to start. But that isn't to say that the BMW M2 is the poor man's BMW M4, because it isn't. The BMW M2 makes 365 hp and gets from 0-60 in about 4.3 seconds, so that's nothing to laugh at. The M2 is for an entirely different customer, one that would choose the M2 over the M4, regardless of money.\n\nThat's because \"smaller, less powerful and slower\" doesn't tell the whole story. The M2 might be all of those things, but it's also lighter than the M4, by about 200 lbs, and more nimble, making it more fun on winding roads. It has sharper steering and a more tossable chassis. The BMW M2 is the car for people who prefer the Ee46 M3 to the F82 M4. It's the car that old-school BMW enthusiasts have been begging BMW for, for what seems like an eternity now. The BMW M2 isn't going to be cross-shopped with the M4, as it's a vastly different car with a different focus for different customers. The M2 is inherently compromised in the name of fun and dynamics, as its ride is more uncomfortable and its cabin more cramped than the M4's, but it's most certainly more entertaining. So the BMW M2 is built for customers who value fun and excitement over outright performance. The same people who bought an E46 M3 back in the day are the same people who will buy the BMW M2.\n\nBut that's not to say that the BMW M4 is worse than the M2. It's just different. The M4 is bigger and heavier, yes, but it's still very fun to drive. But the BMW M4's cabin is much roomier, allowing it to be more comfortable day-in and day-out. The wife is less likely to complain about the rough ride in the M4 as well, as it's almost gained grand touring levels of comfort from its suspension. The M4 can eat up miles effortlessly, while the M2 is more at home with short, windy roads.\n\nHowever, the BMW M4 isn't boring. It's also packing 425 hp and can get from 0-60 mph in around 3.9 seconds with a DCT gearbox. So, in terms of performance, the M4 crushes the M2, despite its weight disadvantage. The BMW M4 can also be a tire-shredding machine when it wants to, as its 420 lb-ft of torque are available super low down in the rev-range, allowing the M4 to roast its rears with the slightest prod of the accelerator. So the M4 can be just as maniacal as the M2. Maybe the M4 is a bit more disconnected than the M2, not giving its driver the genuine sense of feel and connection on the same level as its new younger brother. However, it's still great fun to drive and delivers kick-ass performance, just in a bigger and more usable everyday package. Plus, it has a better badge and we all know that badges mean a lot to real world buyers. 4 is a bigger number than 2, so it's better in the eyes of many.\n\nBoth cars are tremendous, they really are, and they aren't really going to be cross-shopped much. Each car is targeting for its own specific customer base and will do just fine. The appearance of the BMW M2 won't hurt the BMW M4, in terms of sales, in the slightest. The M4 has its own customers and the M2 will have its own as well. So if you're the kind of person who values grin-inducing fun over raw performance and are willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort and usability for it, then the BMW M2 is the car for you. If you're the kind of person who wants to get the best performance car in its class but is willing to compromise a bit of that feel and connection for more everyday usability, than the BMW M4 is for you.

There, according to video surveillance tape studied later, the man opened the box containing the speaker, lifted the product out and put it into one of the pockets in the pair of basketball shorts he was wearing. He closed the box and continued shopping. He then selected an Incipio iPhone 6 case and returned to the same register.\n\nAt that point an employee approached to ring up the sale. After the employee asked the man for his name and address (he provided a La Crescenta address), the worker stepped away for a brief moment and the suspect left the store. On the counter the employee found a set of house keys with an electronic BMW key attached. The employee went outdoors and saw the suspect, who approached him and said he'd left the store to get something from his car and realized he'd left his keys behind. He reentered the store with the Incipio case in hand and paid cash for it.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Stay up to date with what's going on in the 818 >>\n\nThe employee mentioned the odd incident to the store manager who reviewed the surveillance tape, noticed the theft of the wireless speaker and notified the Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Station.\n\nA responding deputy visited the address that had been provided by the suspect and saw a white BMW parked out front, but did not knock on the door of the home. He tried calling the phone number the suspect gave the store, but it was not an operating number.\n\nThere were no warrants out for the man. Later that same evening, store officials notified the sheriff's station that the same man returned at about 7:50 p.m. and returned the speaker because, according to the report, \"he was afraid the cameras may have caught him stealing.\" The store is still desirous of prosecution, despite the fact the item was returned.\n\nFeb. 9\n\nBurglary, vehicle: 1300 block of Foothill Blvd. A woman reported that sometime between 7:20 a.m. and 5 p.m. someone pried open the rear window lock of her 2014 Chevy Tahoe and stole the third-row back seat.\n\nFeb. 10\n\nCommercial burglary: 500 block of Foothill Boulevard. Responding to a burglar alarm at 12:25 a.m., deputies found the front door to a drugstore shattered, as well as glass interior door leading to the pharmacy and lab area. A piece of concrete had been used to break both doors.\n\nThe owner was called to the scene. He didn't immediately see what was taken, although he noted that one shelf seemed unusually empty. He told deputies he'd have to speak to employees in the morning to assess what might have been stolen.\n\nA witness said he'd heard glass shatter about 15 minutes before the deputies arrived and he said he observed what appeared to be a male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt exit through the shattered door and run westbound through the parking lot then get inside a vehicle that took off eastbound on Foothill Boulevard.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nTheft by false pretense: 4500 block of Cypress Drive.

A man told deputies that at about 6:30 p.m. that day he sat down near the rear exit door of a children's play area and placed his wallet on a table.\n\nHe saw two Hispanic males wearing dark clothing walk in his direction toward the door. One of the men grabbed the victim's wallet from the table and headed toward the parking lot. The man followed the two suspects eastbound on Foothill before losing sight of them in the darkness.\n\nA witness described the men as being about 17 or 18 and weighing around 155 pounds, and said \"they looked like brothers.\" One of the suspects was described as having long, dark brown hair. He also said the two young men walked up to an older Hispanic couple with multiple tattoos and suggested the pair may have been their parents.\n\nThey left in a blue van with the wallet, which contained a driver's license, cash and several store and credit cards.\n\nFeb. 15\n\nPetty theft, unlocked vehicle: 200 block of Berkshire Avenue.

A man wearing dark clothing exited the vehicle and began looking into parked cars. The video then showed the suspect getting back in his vehicle and exiting the location. Fingerprints could not be gathered, as the victim had cleaned and reorganized her car.", "Lexus unveiled the LC 500h today in The Netherlands, and I got to take a look inside its new hybrid system. On one hand it seems like a box of magic - it combines two seemingly incompatible transmission types into one package. But that's also the ingenious simplicity of the thing. We don't have all of the details on how it all works yet, but here's a rundown of the high points.\n\nEfficient business in front, low-key party in the back.\n\nWhat makes it all work is the mullet of transmissions. For the new hybrid transmission, Lexus used the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive/Lexus Hybrid System - which consists of an e-CVT with a planetary gearset and two electric motors (one for charging the battery, the other for motivation and regen) - and grafted a conventional four-speed automatic onto the back. The two units actually coexist in one package, with the e-CVT making things efficient and the automatic expanding the capabilities. So at the low end, the system can deliver more torque, and the engine can also run at lower rpm on the highway. It's all thanks to those fixed gear ratios, and it's surprisingly simple.\n\nExcept it's not that simple.\n\nThis is where the virtual gear ratios come in. Like current Lexus hybrids, the system has ratios it can call up with the e-CVT. In this case, there are six virtual ratios to complement the four real physical ratios, for a total of 10 \"gears\" at the transmission's disposal. (Not coincidentally, the V8 LC 500 coupe has a 10-speed automatic.) One of the four fixed gears is always engaged when the car is moving, so the 10 ratios come about from combinations of what the e-CVT in front and the automatic in the back are doing. In other words, all 10 ratios are variations on the four fixed gear ratios, which means that all 10 gears could be considered virtual.\n\nIt won't use all the gears all the time.\n\nIn Eco mode, the car will start off on electric power and skip the first couple of \"gears.\" When it's set to Sport or Sport +, the engine will be engaged from a stop and the transmission will select the lowest ratio. The sportier modes will also ignore the top couple of gear ratios.\n\nIt can drive faster with the engine off.\n\nIn a Lexus GS 450h with the Lexus Hybrid System, for example, at speeds above 62 mph or so the engine has to start up. This is because something needs to take up some slack from the battery-charging motor-generator or else it will start spinning too quickly. With the engine running, that motor-generator can slow down and just use the engine power to charge the batteries. In the Multi Stage System, the addition of the fixed gears means the gas engine can stay shut off up to wheel speeds of about 87 mph. That means highway cruising without the engine running.\n\nIt's no heavier than Lexus's current rear-drive hybrid system.\n\nEngineers were able to offset the added weight of the four-speed automatic by downsizing the motor-generator and switching from a nickel metal hydride battery pack to a lithium-ion one . The battery has about the same power output as before, allowing the car to drive for a mile or so in EV mode, depending on the traffic situation.\n\nYes, it's reminiscent of the BMW/Daimler/GM two-mode system.\n\nWhile the now-defunct Global Hybrid Cooperation's two-mode transmission sounds similar to this (three planetary gearsets, two electric motors, acts like an automatic), it was more akin to a conventional auto with two electric motors and a whole lot of computing power added. This new Lexus system builds off of the e-CVT that Toyota has been putting in hybrids for almost two decades. The biggest difference from the basic e-CVT is that here all output flows through the fixed gears, whereas in the standard e-CVT only power from the second motor-generator goes through a gear reduction. So in the Multi Stage Hybrid, the gas engine also benefits from physical gearing.\n\nYou'll see it in other Lexus models soon, and maybe some Toyotas.\n\nThe next LS sedan, which will share the LC's new architecture, is a given application for the multi Stage Hybrid System. We expect it will show up in the GS hybrid at some point and perhaps a future IS or RC hybrid. It makes less sense in a Prius, where all-out efficiency is favored over performance, but we could see it in a future Toyota sports car (like that Supra we hope Toyota is developing with BMW) or maybe something big like the Highlander. The issue with putting it in something front-drive-based is packaging, as the transaxle would need to grow by the length of the automatic portion, but Toyota recently improved the Prius's transaxle by replacing the e-CVT's planetary gearset with a parallel-gear arrangement. We could see a similar trick employed to put this system into other cars.\n\nThe LC is just as gorgeous as a hybrid.\n\nEspecially in the blue paint we saw it in today, this is a stunning car. The only visual differences between the LC 500 and LC 500h will be the hybrid's blue Lexus badges. Everything else stays the same, down to the wheels and tires. No low-rolling-resistance rubber here, thankfully, although Lexus did choose run-flat tires to avoid adding the weight of a spare tire. And we're told the hybrid system can easily overpower the grip of the rear tires, something Toyota engineers aren't used to. We'll be sure to test that feature extensively once we get behind the wheel in a year or so.\n\nRelated Video:", "The SUV that a witness says former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was in when he allegedly killed two men in the South End in 2012 could be critical to his defense and should not be returned to the Rhode Island dealership that leased it to him until after his trial, his attorney said.\n\nCharles W.

The styling is very rounded without any hint of ruggedness or off-roading prowess. The vehicle is embracing the crossover lifestyle, and initial sales results suggest it was the right thing to do.\n\nConsumer Reports recently did a quick review of the GLC 300. With rear-wheel-drive, you can have it for under $40,000, so it's a bit of a bargain. Many folks would imagine that a 4-banger has's got enough power for the GLC, but even though the old GLK usually came with a 3.5-liter V6, it was much heavier. Jeep SUVs equipped with 9-speed automatics shudder and judder. But Mercedes' own 9G-Tronic is smooth and does its part in lowering those mpg numbers to 28 on the highway.\n\nWhy pay $49,000 to buy a GLC-Class just like the one Consumer Reports tested? Because it sets a new standard in the cabin style and quality, despite being part of a competitive segment. Features like dual-zone climate control, HD radio, power windows and seats are hidden behind a sea of leather and wood trim.\n\nThis being a German car, they kill you with the options, as most of the necessary packages are over $2,000 each. The Sport Package gets you bigger wheels, brakes and an AMG look. Meanwhile, LED lights are part of a $1,500 pack that bundles adaptive high beams and curve illumination.\n\nEven though the GLC is 4.3 inches longer and 2 inches wider than the GLK, it's also 180 pounds lighter. Part of that has to do with the powertrain, but a bigger yet much lighter car is pretty rare nowadays. However, we're not completely sold on this new SUV. BMW's 3.0-liter turbo engine sounds better and delivers a lot more punch. While stylish, the GLC looks too much like a wagon from the back and those big exhaust openings aren't directly connected to the exhaust pipes.\n\nEditor's note: It's pure nonsense what Consumer Reports is saying about the shifter. It's a standard safety feature built into most cars. Do people open the door and leave their car without putting it in park? Also, hitting the stalk by accident while driving would destroy the gearbox if it went into park instead of neutral.\n\nPlay Video", "The photo of Supervisor Rick Randolph's BMW convertible hogging two spaces popped up on two local media sites today.\n\n\"Is this Car-gate?\" asks Randolph about the photograph submitted to Scottsville Weekly and the Schilling Show.\n\nRandolph, who represents the Scottsville District on the Albemarle Board of Supervisors, says he was late to a meeting at the Mudhouse at Mill Creek February 17 when he backed in his 15-year-old Beamer.

The suspects threw her into the trunk of a car, beat her and left her tied to a tree in a mountainous area 30 miles away.\n\nThe child went through a terrible trauma, but survived, and now the focus is on finding those responsible for the abduction and beating.\n\nIt seemed like a normal day Tuesday in a nice neighborhood. The 13-year-old girl got off the bus and walked about a quarter of a mile to her home, when she was confronted by four masked men.\n\n\"She had arrived home in the area of Shepherd and Academy, when she walked up near her front door, that's when a couple of young men approached her and said, 'Come with us,'\" said Tony Botti, Fresno County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe girl was thrown into the trunk of a car, driven up a windy mountain road for about 30 miles, then her captors dragged her up a mountain trail and tied her to a tree, then beat her.

Unlike those other models, though, the hybrid Lexus LC 500h is being introduced before the LC 500 even goes into production.\n\nLexus debuted the LC 500, a sport coupe with a 5-liter V-8 engine and luscious styling, at the Detroit auto show last month. At a special press event in The Netherlands sponsored by Lexus, it unveiled the LC 500h, a twin brother to the earlier model that uses an economical and powerful newly developed hybrid drivetrain. Lexus will show the car off to the world at the upcoming Geneva auto show.\n\nThe LC 500h's chief engineer Kohi Sato said the drive system produces enough torque that you could spin the drive wheels on dry pavement with a fast start.\n\nBold styling for the Lexus LC 500h (pictures) See full gallery 1 - 6 of 19 Next Prev\n\nThe car itself uses the same, sleek design as its predecessor, the only difference being blue-tinted Lexus badges and hybrid badges on the sides. It's an impressively-designed car with bold styling, some of which reaches back into the Lexus toolbox and some cues newly rendered. A large \"spindle\" grille, in Lexus lexicology, adorns the front. Designer Tadao Mori said that newer elements, such as the taillights, could find their way onto future Lexus models.\n\nOne element the LC 500h shares with the Corvette and some historic Ferraris is the way the rear of the cabin tapers inwards, reducing cabin space but emphasizing the rear fenders.\n\nThe LC 500h is a front-engine rear-wheel-drive car, a classic sport configuration, with electric drive motors enhancing the output from its 3.5-liter V-6 engine, giving it 354 total horsepower. And like other Lexus hybrids, it stores braking energy as electricity, reusing it to help drive the car. That hybrid system is similar to that in the RX 450h, and although Lexus has not given fuel economy numbers for the LC 500h, the RX 450h SUV achieves 30 mpg for its combined city and highway rating. In other words, expect the LC 500h to do better.\n\nHybrid systems aren't known for giving drivers direct control over power output, so Lexus added a wrinkle to make the LC 500h more of a sport performer. The company engineered a four-speed automatic transmission into the driveline, complementing the existing electronic continuously variable transmission (e-CVT). According to Sato, the fixed gears of the automatic let the driver feel the power delivery from the throttle more directly. The e-CVT remains in play, mixing power from the gasoline engine and electric drive motors, ensuring excellent fuel economy.\n\nAs one benefit of the fixed gear transmission, Sato noted the car can go 87 mph when cruising under electric power, where current Lexus hybrids can only manage 62 mph.\n\nA driver-selectable sport mode in the car affects throttle, transmission, steering and suspension, at least hinting at the potential for impressive handling. Sato said that Lexus benchmarked the BMW 6-series during the LC 500h's development.\n\nLexus has been trying to break free of its former, conservative reputation, and cars such as the IS F haven't quite done the trick. Other F Sport versions of its existing models, such as the RC F, are bringing it closer to the sport mantle, but the LC 500 and LC 500h look very promising indeed. Bold styling and a newly developed platform could crack the performance ceiling, and make it a true competitor to the likes of BMW and Audi.\n\nHowever, it will be some time before you get to drive the LC 500h, as it won't hit showrooms until 2017.

The trials are expected to start in the labs in the second quarter and will progress to outdoor tests this summer. AT&T also said that it expects to conduct field trials of 5G before year-end, with those trials focusing on providing wireless connectivity to fixed locations.\n\nAT&T provided a few more specifics about its tests than its competitor Verizon (NYSE: VZ), which announced last September that it is working with partners Alcatel-Lucent, Ericsson, Cisco, Nokia, Qualcomm and Samsung to test 5G in the company's innovation centers in Waltham, Mass., and San Francisco. Verizon's technology field trials are expected to begin this year.\n\nAT&T, not surprisingly, is trying to play up its software-defined networking strategy as being a key to 5G trials and eventual deployment, noting that its software-centric network architecture will help it get the benefits of 5G's promise of faster network speeds and lower latency.\n\nIf you, like me, are looking for answers to your questions about 5G and what it means for the industry, your company and the consumer, then you should come to my 5G luncheon panel at Mobile World Congress. I'll have top executives from both AT&T and Verizon on hand to provide some of the latest details on 5G trials, collaborations and standards. The luncheon event takes place on Tuesday, Feb. 23, at the Fira Congress Hotel (located just a short walk from the Fira Gran Via). The event, \"The Path to 5G: What Operators Need to do to Prepare for the Network of the Future\" begins at 12:30 p.m. and ends at 2 p.m. My panelists include:\n\n\u00b7 Tom Keathley, SVP, wireless network architecture and design at AT&T;\n\n\u00b7 Ignacio Berberana, senior technology expert in 5G with Telef\u00f3nica Group;\n\n\u00b7 Adam Koeppe, VP of network technology and planning at Verizon;\n\n\u00b7 Chris Pearson, president, 4G Americas; and\n\n\u00b7 John Smee, senior director of engineering at Qualcomm Research\n\nI'll allow plenty of time for you to ask the panelists your 5G-related questions.

That's because when people think of a handset, their minds immediately go to an iPhone or a device made by the likes of Samsung or LG Electronics.\n\nBut that isn't stopping Acadine Technologies, founded by one of the folks behind the Firefox software, from jumping into the software fray powering not only phones, but drones, medical equipment and more. The Hong Kong-based startup launched a new project on Wednesday that it believes will get you to use something else for a change.\n\nAcadine's niche operating system, called H5OS, is an attempt to break the stranglehold that Google and Apple have on the software inside your electronic gadgets. The two giants wield tremendous power over the products and services available to us -- mapping, social networking, streaming video, email and instant messaging. Even though competitors have largely failed, Acadine hopes to win you over by building out a universe of products running on its software.\n\n\"People will encounter these devices without knowing what operating system is on it -- or in most cases care,\" Gong said in an interview in Paris ahead of the company's debut at the Mobile World Congress tech show next week in Barcelona.\n\nH5OS won't register with many people. But Gong argued that you'll care when its software lets device makers build a more useful drone, action camera or smartwatch, or fill a void in the basic-phone market for those who don't want a big-screen Android or iPhone.\n\nThe list of failures in the attempt to squeeze into the business dominated by iOS and Android is long: Microsoft Windows, BlackBerry, Samsung's Tizen and most recently, Mozilla's Firefox OS have all struggled. But Acadine won't try to win by taking on Android and iOS directly, an approach Chief Executive Li Gong believes is futile.\n\nH5OS won't arrive in products until later this year, Gong said, but the company announced several partners Wednesday to help bring it to fruition: mobile processor technology company ARM, phone chipmaker Qualcomm, phone maker Alcatel, and mobile device technology specialist Thundersoft.\n\nGiven the track record of failures from other high-profile companies, Acadine faces an uphill battle.\n\n\"Fighting against Google and Apple in mobile operating systems is pointless, as Microsoft could tell you,\" said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson.\n\nH5OS is based on Firefox OS, a project Gong championed in his former job as Mozilla's president, but it's diverged significantly from those open-source roots, he said. For example, the company no longer has to ensure the core software will also work on personal computers, as Mozilla does with Firefox.\n\nLike Firefox OS, H5OS can run apps written to use the Web technology built into browsers, which gives the company a bit of a head start. The software can power a phone, for instance, that's useful even without the direct help of the thousands of developers who write apps for Android and iOS.\n\nMozilla pushed Firefox OS for years and landed significant partnerships with carriers like Telefonica in Spain, Orange in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany. But Mozilla's focus on very inexpensive phones ultimately failed, and it ditched its partnerships in December and the scrapped the phone project altogether in February.\n\nAcadine is getting a fresh start. It raised $100 million in its first round of funding and has about 120 employees so far, Gong said. Its Hong Kong headquarters is closer to Chinese manufacturing powers than US companies, but it also has a Silicon Valley office in Palo Alto. It hopes to make money two ways: through fees like royalties and technical support that are paid when device makers use its software, and through services like search, e-commerce and preloaded apps.\n\nAnd above all, it'll steer clear of Google. Customers still buy a lot of retro phones only good for voice calls, and Android only works on devices that have a touch screen.\n\n\"We're targeting segments where Android is weak,\" Gong said.\n\nTags: Mobile World Congress 2016MobilePhonesFirefox OS", "A sixth form college with a capacity for 1,000 students is to move into a former HSBC office block later this year following a

Q4 2015, the sampled period of the report, would appear to be a significant one for the mobile industry with a couple of milestones passed, according to Ericsson.\n\nFirstly, the report claims 68 million global mobile subscriptions were added in the quarter, with India leading the way in terms of growth with 21 million new subscribers. China, the US and Myanmar followed with 6m additions for the former and 5m for the latter two respectively. Meanwhile, the number of LTE subscriptions worldwide topped a billion for the first time, with 160 million additions in Q4. The report also claimed mobile penetration has now reached 100% for the first time, with 7.3 billion mobile subscribers worldwide.\n\nBack in November Telecoms.com reported the forecasted toppling of a billion LTE subscribers, and how Ericsson forecasted 150million 5G subscriptions by 2021. Ericsson has maintained that forecast in this edition of the report, despite recent announcements from global operators about over intentions for trials and roadmaps coming in 2016, like AT&T.\n\nOther areas of the report measured consumer response to poor mobile service by sticking wireless electroencephalography (EEG), pulse meters and eye-tracking equipment onto the head of subjects and taking a variety of stress readings. Ericsson reckons that a poor mobile video streaming experience is as harrowing as watching a horror movie, trying to solve a maths problem or standing at the edge of a \"virtual\" cliff, whatever that may be.\n\nWith MWC lurking just around the corner, Ericsson's got another load of announcements out of the way before the creeping behemoth of the telecoms industry rolls into town for another week. Other stuff the vendor's been up to includes a contract win with Idea Cellular in India for 4G infrastructure rollout to serve 40 million customers; and another MoU, this time with Telef\u00f3nica, to work on even more 5G things like virtualization and radio cleverness at the operator's 5TONIC lab in Spain. It's also confirmed some of the showcases we can expect at MWC next week, with IoT, cloud innovation and, of course, 5G.", "The global telematics market is expected to grow from an estimated $26,314.4 million in 2015, and reach $140,100 million by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 28.5% during 2016 - 2022. The growth of the global telematics market is being driven due to several factors, including government initiatives to include advanced technology in public safety on roads, increasing demand for premium passenger cars and growing demand for connectivity in vehicles. The use of telematics has been constantly increasing in insurance sector for tracking the driving conditions to calculate precise vehicle insurance premium. North America dominated the global market; however Asia-Pacific is estimated to grow at the highest pace during the forecast period. The high cost of telematics equipment and hacking threats are the key restraints in the global market. The poor internet infrastructure in the developing countries is also hindering the adoption of telematics.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150727/756778 )\n\nExplore Report with Detailed TOC at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/global-telematics-market\n\nThe information and data in the publication \"Global Telematics Market Size, Share, Development, Growth and Demand Forecast to 2022\" represent the research and analysis of data from various primary and secondary sources.

Vehicle telematics, trailer tracking, and container tracking are the common application areas of telematics. They are used to transform automobiles into communication objects. Earlier telematics were integrated only on premium vehicles; now it's either offered as standard feature on select vehicles, or as an option for the low-priced vehicles. It also enables patient's health tracking while travelling.\n\nBrowse Related Research at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/industry-report/automotive-and-transportation\n\nIn order to assure vehicular safety, the government in several countries has been promoting the use of telematics in vehicles. For instance, eCall project promoted by European Commission (EC) was adopted in Europe in 2013. eCall is targeted to provide assistance to motorists, who have met with road accident and are unable to speak due to injuries. It is applicable for the vehicles in which telematics is installed. The government of China rolled out a program in 2014 that promotes the use of fleet management solution in every vehicle. In Brazil, a program known as SIMRAV has been introduced to monitor and control crimes associated with vehicles. This program is also operated with the help of telematics.\n\nThe key competitors in the global telematics market include Verizon Communication Inc., Harman International Industries Inc., TomTom International BV, AT&T, Vodafone Group Plc, Ford Motor Company, BMW Group, Telefonica SA, MiX Telematics, Trimble Navigation Ltd.\n\nGlobal Connected Car Market - https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/connected-car-market\n\nGlobal Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Market - https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/intelligent-transportation-system-market\n\nGlobal Electric Bus Market - https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/electric-bus-market\n\nAbout P&S Market Research\n\nP&S Market Research is a market research company, which offers market research and consulting services for various geographies around the globe.

He'd just announced the $22 billion purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service and was touting an initiative called Internet.org, a low-bandwidth suite of basic services carriers would offer in conjunction with Facebook to get hundreds of millions of people online for the first time. He pledged to \"build what is going to be a more profitable model with more subscribers for carriers.\" By sticking together, the Facebook founder said, both sides could benefit handsomely.\n\nAs Zuckerberg prepares to return to Barcelona for this year's MWC on Feb. 22, phone executives say his company looks more like a competitor than a partner. Last year, WhatsApp introduced free voice calls -- something Facebook already offered -- and both brands have messaging apps. These so-called over-the-top services cut into mobile carriers' voice and texting revenue because they're offered over the Internet. Some phone companies say Facebook and its ilk are freeloaders that rely on carriers' network infrastructure without spending any money to support it. \"WhatsApp is competing with us, not only with messaging but with voice, too,\" Telef\u00f3nica Chief Operating Officer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete said in August at a telecommunications industry event in the Spanish coastal city of Santander. \"The premise should be, same services, same rules.\"\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has huge operations in Latin America. And it's in emerging markets where the tension with the messaging apps is most evident. Carriers there are more dependent on revenue from voice and text (in developed countries, data is the bigger moneymaker). A Brazilian judge in December ordered WhatsApp to suspend service in the country following a complaint from a telecommunications lobbying group, though the decision was soon overruled by another court. Since October, Egypt has shut down several Internet calling apps. India's telecom regulator this month barred operators from giving discounts for access to specific websites. A direct challenge to Zuckerberg's Internet.org plans, the Indian ruling effectively ended Facebook's partnership with Reliance Communications, which had offered free access to the site and 30 others in some data plans.\n\nIn South Africa, carriers MTN Group and Vodacom Group contend that services such as WhatsApp, Skype, Google Hangouts, and the Viber messaging app cost the country billions of rand in tax revenue and compromise security because their encryption makes it easier for criminals to avoid government surveillance. South Africa's telecom regulator has begun an investigation into the impact of over-the-top services, and Nigeria is considering regulating them. \"Technology has outpaced current consumer legislation in many countries,\" says Lisa Felton, who oversees regulatory issues for Vodafone, the controlling shareholder of Vodacom.\n\nWhatsApp doesn't provide data on voice calls, but it claims 1 billion users, roughly double the number it had when Facebook bought the company. And Skype says it carries in excess of 2 billion minutes of calls per day. In Eastern Europe, where such apps are growing in popularity for national and international calls, mobile carriers' voice revenue has dropped by a third over the past five years, a decline that hasn't been fully offset by rising data usage, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Erhan Gurses. Facebook declined to comment.\n\nNot all carriers are lining up against Facebook. The company has more than a dozen partnerships with phone companies from Paraguay to the Philippines. Many of them say teaming up with Facebook is beneficial, because it boosts data usage and has the potential to increase revenue. Millicom International Cellular, a carrier with more than 63 million subscribers in Africa and Latin America, has run promotions in certain markets where it offers free access to Facebook and Internet.org for a couple of months. The company reported last year that 33 percent of subscribers who take part end up upgrading to fee-paying data plans. Similarly, South Africa's No. 3 mobile company, Cell C, offers Facebook and WhatsApp for free in certain subscription packages, because they draw new users. \"If we don't innovate around these services and drive value to our customers, we run a higher risk of being left out of the future entirely,\" said Cell C Chief Executive Officer Jos\u00e9 Dos Santos in an e-mail.\n\nIn the long run, say some industry analysts, WhatsApp and other alternatives shouldn't be seen as a threat to the voice service of phone companies. The typically superior sound quality of the voice calls in the apps uses lots of data. \"If carriers price their data offerings correctly, it could drive up revenues,\" says John Delaney, an analyst at researcher IDC. And when people graduate to video apps like Skype, data consumption grows exponentially.

Driving into content, such as soccer rights, Vivendi is now attempting to ward off accumulating global competition, including Discovery-Eurosport, which snagged European rights to the Olympic Games from 2018 and 2022 in France and the U.K.\n\nVivendi's increased investment in original programming will reduce dependency on external content, De Puyfontaine said - which could be bad news for major product suppliers such as Hollywood studios, unless they enter co-production or co-financing partnerships with Vivendi on premium TV dramas or movies.\n\nRevenues at Studiocanal, Europe's biggest movie investor, increased 6% in 2015 to \u20ac563 million ($625 million), notably thanks to the success of the David Heyman-produced \"Paddington\" and \"Shaun the Sheep,\" made with Aardman, \"Imitation Game,\" which Studiocanal distributed, and the performance of \"Legend,\" produced by Working Title with Studiocanal financing, at Studiocanal's high-flying U.K. operation.\n\nAdam Crozier at ITV turned around the U.K. broadcaster's fortunes through robust acquisitions. Just how Bollor\u00e9 could give Vivendi new momentum makes for a fascinating narrative. The conference call had enticing hints - advanced discussions with Telefonica to launch a mobile first video services across Latin America this fall, for instance - in what looks like a game-plan to reach out to European peers to co-produce and distribute high-end TV shows and services. But the presentation was short on detail. And the devil is in the details.\n\nVivendi, whose full year results were broadly in line with expectations - total revenues of \u20ac10.8 billion ($12.0 billion), up 1.4%; operational profits of \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.2 billion), giving it a 10% profit margin - did make two announcements Thursday.\n\nFirstly, Vivendi owned Canal Plus Group, Europe's second-biggest pay TV operator, has entered negotiations for a five-year exclusive distribution of Al Jazeera sports channels beIN Sports on Canal Plus in France. Vivendi itself has launched a public tender for GameLoft, the Paris-based mobile game maker, and No. 2 world-leader in terms of downloads, in which Vivendi has built a 30% stake.\n\nBoth moves come as Vivendi for the first time broke out financials at six Canal Plus channels in France, revealing escalating losses since 2012 culminating in \u20ac264 million ($293 million) red ink last year, in what looks like a play for the beIN Sports deal to pass muster with French anti-trust authorities.\n\nbeIN Sports snagged rights to key French soccer matches in 2012, since when Canal Plus France subs and revenue have deteriorated, as Vivendi was at pains to point out on Thursday. Deal still has to clear France's anti-trust authorities, which is no given, however.\n\n\"The Canal Plus Group-beIN Sports agreement makes sense. There is more competition in France, with Numericable taking rights to English Premier League soccer matches,\" said Fran\u00e7ois Godard, at Enders Analysis.\n\n\"Otherwise, the situation at Canal Plus in France certainly looks very preoccupying.\"\n\nRestructuring Canal Plus in France, via content investment and improving the customer experience, Vivendi reckons it will reach breakeven in 2018. \"Unfortunately, however, it has not given much detail on investment in content and set-top boxes,\" Godard added.", "Here is a look at TV networks and online outlets that will show the 88th Academy Awards in big European, Asian and Latin American markets, in South Africa, Australia and Canada.\n\nFor those who won't attend the 88th Academy Awards and happen to be outside the U.S. on Oscar Sunday, it can be difficult to figure out where to watch the awards show hosted by Chris Rock.\n\nABC, which has aired Hollywood's biggest night every year since 1976, will again kick off its Oscars coverage Sunday at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT with red-carpet coverage, followed 90 minutes later by the awards ceremony.

(Compiled by Brussels newsroom)", "Traveling overseas and want to swap to a local carrier? You'll have to take out the SIM card in your phone and replace it with the carrier's own SIM card. While not particularly inconvenient, it isn't efficient either, not to mention there is always the possibility of losing your original SIM which means more work when you get back home.\n\nHowever it looks like eSIMs could become more mainstream, thanks to GSMA recently announcing a new eSIM specification aimed at smartwatches, fitness trackers, and tablets, and the good news is that the Samsung Gear S2 classic 3G will be the first smartwatch that will take advantage of the new specification, according to Samsung.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the concept of eSIMs, basically this refers to an embedded/programmable SIM inside a device that lets users choose between carriers. This means that you won't need to get a new SIM if you were to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile, and so on. If this sounds familiar, it is because Apple has already introduced such a feature in the form of the Apple SIM.\n\nAccording to GSMA, the eSIM is currently backed by some of the big names in mobile, like Samsung, LG, Microsoft, and Huawei, along with carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telef\u00f3nica, and EE. Unfortunately this specification is specific to wearables and tablets, but it is expected to become available for smartphones later this year in June.", "News: New specification is backed by Vodafone, Telefonica, EE, Apple, Qualcomm and others.\n\nThe GSMA has taken a further step towards connecting all devices with the launch of a new specification that is already being built into new Samsung devices.\n\nReleased by the GSMA's Consumer Remote SIM Provisioning initiative, the new technology will allow consumers to connect companion devices that operate independently of a smartphone.\n\nThey will be able to remotely connect these devices to a mobile network of their choice by easily activating the SIM embedded in the device.\n\nThe embedded SIM can be switched between different networks without having to access the inner electronics of the device, which is not an issue with smartphones but is with wearables where space is more limited.\n\nWhile the initiative will not replace SIM cards in the field, it aims to allow multiple devices to be connected through the same subscription. Device manufacturers, meanwhile, will be able to develop lighter and smaller mobile devices more suited for the wearable technology applications.\n\nThe initiative is a consumer application for work previously undertaken in the M2M world by the GSMA to allow devices sold in bulk to be remotely switched\n\nSome of the world's largest operators, including Vodafone, Telefonica, EE and CK Hutchinson are backing the initiative. For them, it could provide a new revenue stream as consumers connect more of their secondary mobile devices directly to data networks.\n\nThere is also involvement from large device-makers such as Apple, Huawei, LG, Microsoft, Sony and Samsung, as well as chip-makers such as Qualcomm.\n\nCurrently most non-smartphone consumer devices rely on being wirelessly connected to a smartphone. For example, the Apple Watch has no cellular connectivity of its own and must always be paired with an iPhone to be of use. This is typically performed through Bluetooth.\n\nThe Samsung Gear S is an exception to this, carrying its own 3G connectivity to allow people to receive messages without a phone.\n\n\"This is an essential next step as device makers use embedded SIMs in smaller devices, particularly cellular-enabled wearables,\" said Ben Wood, Chief of Research at CCS Insight.\n\n\"CCS Insight forecasts 30 percent of smartwatches sold in 2020 will be cellular enabled which underlines the opportunity that is emerging.\"\n\nAlongside the GSMA announcement, Samsung has announced that the new Samsung Gear S2 classic 3G will be equipped with a GSMA-standardised e-SIM.\n\nHowever, this application will not just be found in wearables, but tablets as well, which generally don't feature cellular connectivity.\n\nIan Pannell, Chief Engineer at the GSMA, told CBR that the inability to remotely provision SIMs had been one of several obstacles in launching cellular-enabled wearables.\n\n\"The consumer needs choice and local user control. This specification will enable consumers to swap their device onto other networks.\"\n\nPannell described this as \"a digital replacement for the pocketful of SIM cards you might have in your wallet.\n\n\"The device doesn't have to be earmarked for a particular network but can be sold worldwide to anyone.\"\n\nPannell told CBR that this was part of a wider effort to seed the IoT and wearables market.", "Today, Samsung has announced that it will be releasing a new Gear S2 classic model which comes equipped with a GSMA standardized e-SIM. This will be the first consumer device on the market to feature such an e-SIM.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, an e-SIM replaces the physical SIM cards that we have become accustomed to with a small embedded chip, which cannot be removed. The compact size of a chip is certainly much more suited to the smartwatch form factor and customers will be able to simply download a mobile network operator's profile to the watch to get themselves connected.\n\nSamsung has been working with a number of global operators to ensure compliance with the GSMA Consumer Remote SIM Provisioning architecture, including: M1 Limited, Orange, Singtel, StarHub Ltd., Telef\u00f3nica, TeliaSonera, and Vodafone Group, among others. In other words, this isn't a proprietary Samsung e-SIM that might lock you out of some networks. Using the GSMA standard should allow for easy switching between operators and upgrading of contracts.\n\n\"We worked closely with the mobile industry to create a global and interoperable specification that gives consumers with a mobile subscription the freedom to remotely connect their devices to a mobile network. This is just the beginning of what is possible and will open up the market to new and exciting device.\" - Jean-Christophe Tisseuil, Head of SIM, GSMA\n\nAs well as doing away with physical SIM cards in mobile products, e-SIM technology is also seen as a crucial development for internet-of-things device and machine-to-machine communication. Automatic and wireless updating of carrier information, as well as more discrete hardware, will help to bring many more devices online and make managing their connections much easier.\n\nThe new Gear S2 classic 3G equipped with GSMA-compliant eSIM will be available for purchase in March.", "The day the physical SIM card disappears is slowly getting closer. Last year, we heard that Samsung, Apple, and various mobile carriers were working to create a new standard for embedded or eSIMs (programmable SIMs that allow you to switch carriers without swapping the physical card in your device). Now, the GSMA has announced a new eSIM specification for smartwatches, fitness trackers, and tablets, with Samsung's Gear S2 Classic 3G the first device on the market to come equipped with the new technology.\n\nNow, a few caveats are needed. This isn't the first mobile device to offer a programmable SIM card (certain iPads have this functionality using Apple's own tech, for example). Nor does the standard apply to smartphones, with the GSMA saying that won't be coming until June. However, this is still a big step forward for the eSIM, with the new specification backed by some of world's largest hardware manufacturers (including Samsung, LG, Microsoft, and Huawei) and mobile carriers (including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telef\u00f3nica, and EE).\n\nApple is reportedly involved in developing the eSIM too\n\nMissing from this public lineup of partners is Apple. The company has gone its own way by creating the programmable Apple SIM, but is reportedly involved in the GSMA's development of the eSIM. Last year, the GSMA told The Financial Times that the association would continue \"to work with Apple to secure their support for the initiative,\" before adding: \"We are optimistic, a formal agreement with them is still in progress.\"\n\nNevertheless, the GSMA is pretty excited about the news. \"This is the only common, interoperable and global specification that has the backing of the mobile industry and lets consumers with a mobile subscription remotely connect their devices to a mobile network,\" said the association's chief technology officer, Alex Sinclair, in a press release. \"This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices.\"\n\nThe Samsung Gear S2 Classic 3G will be available from March, but we'll see more fruits of the GSMA's work later this year when the eSIM specification for smartphones is announced.", "On 9 February 2016, millions of people worldwide celebrated Safer Internet Day (#SID2016). It was an opportunity for schools, charities and other organisations to run digital safety events but also for technology companies to showcase their child online protection initiatives.\n\nProtecting young people should be a priority for digital businesses, say the Guidelines for Industry on Child Online Protection (pdf), which were developed by UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and include advice on educating children, parents and teachers about online safety and responsible use of ICT.\n\nWhile there has been criticism that some businesses do not take online safety seriously enough, other companies are going above and beyond to help families manage digital risks. As internet safety expert John Carr, who has advised the ITU and the EU, says, \"Working through governments and inter-governmental agencies like the UN is, of course, extremely important but it can sometimes take years to see any results. Companies can change things now and thankfully many of them are ready to step up.\"\n\n\"If we are going to solve tomorrow's global challenges, we must come together today to inspire young people everywhere with the promise of technology,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in 2015. Safety and security is central to that promise and Microsoft has created a broad range of resources for young people, parents, carers and teachers on topics such as bullying, sexting and hate speech online. Its YouthSpark programme is also helping more than 300 million young people around the world to improve their digital skills.\n\n\"It may sound like a clich\u00e9 but the multi-stakeholder approach is the only way to achieve meaningful results in the long run,\" says Mauro Accurso of mobile industry body the GSMA, which is currently working with UNICEF to promote digital safety across Latin America. \"Government, industry and civil society need to work hand in hand on matters relating to child online protection if we are going to make a difference.\"\n\nAs Lisa Felton, head of consumer policy and content standards at Vodafone Group, points out, \"Young people see the internet as an essential part of their lives and do not necessarily see a separation of being 'online' or 'offline'. However, we need to ensure they are aware that their online activity and behaviour may have particular risks and consequences, and support education and awareness initiatives so they have the resilience and confidence for the internet to be a positive experience.\"\n\nResources developed by Vodafone, such as Digital Parenting, are helping millions of families in the UK, Greece, Qatar and other countries. And, following a Vodafone survey of 5,000 teenagers in 11 countries which revealed that one in five teens had been bullied online, the company launched its #BeStrong anti-bullying campaign in 2015.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica, the Familia Digital platform provides technology news, FAQs, videos, games and surveys to help parents, guardians and educators stay up-to-date. The resources are available in various countries including Spain, El Salvador and Guatemala. According to Telef\u00f3nica's sustainability innovation manager Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Cantarino de Fr\u00edas, \"The platform is also a place to share experiences and testimonials and help overcome the challenges and difficulties people might face due to technological change and the constant appearance of new applications and services.\"\n\nChild online protection is also a priority for leading social media companies and search engines. Last year, Twitter launched a new safety centre and ASKfm revamped its safety resources, for example. As well as developing innovative safe search tools, Google's recent education work includes supporting an online safety campaign in Kenya and working with Parent Zone to tour UK primary schools.\n\nAs more people go online and on mobiles, technology companies share the responsibility for educating children, parents and teachers about the safe, responsible and positive use of ICT.\n\n\"The tech industry has brought us remarkable devices, platforms and apps to connect the world. It is incumbent on them to also provide the tools, rules and educational efforts to empower parents to confidently navigate the online world with their kids,\" says Stephen Balkam, founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.\n\nMany businesses are taking this task seriously. More than 20 technology companies including Dropbox and Tumblr make up the Thorn Tech Task Force, for example, and a number of businesses pledged to tackle online child sexual exploitation at the #WeProtect Children Online Global Summit last November. As UNICEF deputy executive director Fatoumata Ndiaye commented ahead of the summit, \"... protecting children online is an urgent global priority\".\n\nFor children everywhere, #SID2016 is not just something that trends in February; its mission is relevant - indeed, vital - all year round. With the continued support of the technology industry, young people could be even safer in their digital spaces every single day.\n\nContent on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with UNICEF, sponsor of the child rights and business hub", "The day the physical SIM card disappears is slowly getting closer.

The GSMA also produces industry-leading events such as Mobile World Congress, Mobile World Congress Shanghai and the Mobile 360 Series conferences.", "Cut-throat competition hampers investment, GSMA's Granryd says\n\nPhone-carrier mergers in Europe are needed to secure investments for data networks and prevent the region from falling behind other parts of the world, said an industry group chief, putting pressure on regulators scrutinizing billions of dollars in proposed deals.\n\n\"Consolidation is duly needed in Europe,\" Mats Granryd, the newly appointed director general at industry group GSMA, said in an interview at the group's headquarters in London. \"Consumers are important, but we need to make sure the business is thriving and able to put money into the networks.\"\n\nGranryd and the carriers he represents are pushing for European regulators to allow for more combinations that would alleviate competitive pressures and bring about cost savings. TeliaSonera AB and Telenor ASA abandoned a Danish merger in September amid European Union objections, and Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said consumer benefits, such as avoiding price increases, are central to her scrutiny of phone deals.\n\nNext up, CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. is seeking approvals for two major deals. The Hong Kong-based company received a statement of objections cataloging EU concerns over its plans to create the U.K.'s biggest mobile-phone business by combining its Three unit with Telefonica SA's O2. Hutchison is also trying to combine its Italian business with that of VimpelCom Ltd.\n\nNext week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, an annual phone-industry event organized by GSMA, has attracted more interest than before from EU officials, said Granryd, a former chief executive officer of Sweden's Tele2 AB. He argues the ever-increasing data content in networks makes the issue of expediting mergers more urgent.\n\n\"Having poor quality in a voice conversation is just irritating, and if you have a dropped call, you can call back,\" he said. \"Having a dropped call in your data session is a completely different thing: did you buy your ticket, did you transfer your money or not? Where is it? We need to be super-connected in order to be competitive as an area.\"\n\nAmong other pending deals set to receive regulator scrutiny, Vodafone Group Plc and Liberty Global Plc agreed this week to merge their Dutch assets, after abandoning talks over a broader asset swap last year. Orange SA is in discussions to acquire Bouygues Telecom in France in a transaction that could be valued as much as 10 billion euros ($11 billion), reducing the number of phone carriers in the country to three from four.\n\n\"Going from four to three is almost a no-brainer,\" Granryd said. He pointed to Austria as a healthy example of such consolidation. The number of service providers in the country shrank to three from four after Hutchison bought Orange Austria in 2013.\n\nStill, the choice of metrics is central to the merger benefit debate, which has few long-term examples. GSMA argues that unit prices, or cost per megabyte consumed, have declined in Austria, signaling that merger concerns are overstated. Industry critics, including Helsinki-based consultancy Rewheel, counter that this effect is due to growing data consumption, and consumers pay more to purchase the same amount of gigabyte allowance. Hutchison's pledge to freeze prices in the U.K. has met the same criticism.\n\nIndustry Challenges\n\nGranryd lauded carriers' infrastructure spinoffs as a good way to free up cash and focus on customer service. Telecom Italia SpA listed its towers unit last year while Telefonica SA is considering an initial public offering of its newly created tower and submarine-cable unit Telxius.\n\n\"That's a brilliant way of reducing your balance sheet,\" Granryd said. \"It's truly a different business, it's real estate.\"\n\nGranryd also urged the industry itself to take action to improve its standing among consumers.\n\n\"Customer interface, customer service, business models, lock-in periods, the fine print, the bill shocks, roaming,\" Granryd said, ticking off a list of longstanding customer complaints. \"We need to correct those as an industry.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal."]}, "Google": {"2016-02-17": ["The UC Davis College of Engineering, joining colleges and universities across the United States, will celebrate National Engineers Week, known as E-Week, with an ambitious schedule of activities and programs that focus on engineering accomplishments.\n\nThe four-day event is designed to enhance the public perception of the engineering profession, while also encouraging outreach efforts to promote pre-college interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education.\n\nThe UCD-based activities will begin with an introductory \"Donuts with the Dean\" ceremony from 9 to 10 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 23, in Kemper Hall's Bruce and Marie West Lobby.

Programs such as Girls Who Code, Google's Made with Code and Qualcomm's Qcamp aim to get girls interested in coding and technology and keep them interested through college.\n\nPrograms like 100Kin10 could ultimately help offset the industry's gender imbalance by increasing the number of women who graduate with STEM degrees.\n\nMany tech companies -- including Apple, Facebook, Google and Intel -- have made promises to improve diversity, but progress is slow. The tech industry is still dominated by men, with women filling about 15 percent of tech jobs on average.\n\nAnd of course, some in Silicon Valley still seem clueless when it comes to women.

RTI Marketing, a top choice, is a Certified Google Partner that has been ranking clients on the top page of Google Search results for over 5 years and has accumulated a vast array of SEO techniques for all types of businesses.\n\n1. Are they Easy to Communicate With?\n\nIs the company in question willing and able to communicate with you? When you call, do you get an outsourced individual on the other line or do you get someone local who is willing to learn about your business and your long and short-term goals? Communication and trust is an extremely important part of any successful SEO campaign because without transparency, it can be difficult to see results.\n\n2. What's the Process Like?\n\nDoes the company in question explain how they plan to get your website to rank? Of course if you are not yet a client of theirs it isn't realistic to expect them to divulge sensitive details, but they should be able to give you a general strategy on how they expect to get your website to rank and a generaltimelineas well.\n\n3. Are they willing to provide you with aWebsite SEO Audit?\n\nAn SEO Audit is one of the most important parts of any successful SEO campaign, and any alleged Long Island SEO Company that isn't willing to provide you a free audit should be viewed with extreme caution. At RTI Marketing, anSEO Auditis comprised of three (3)elements:On-Page SEO Analysis,Off-Page SEO Analysis, andIndustry Analysis. I'll explain in more depth:\n\nAll three of these elements are crucial components to getting your website to rank. They all work together to show Google that you have a quality website that deserves to be seen. If you're missing one piece, the rest fall apart.\n\nAnOn-Page SEO Analysistakes a look at things you can improve on your website to help the search engines find you better, or to make your website look better to the searcher when they do find you. These include optimizing header tags, meta descriptions, and keyword text.\n\nAnOff-Page SEO Analysistakes a look at the difficulty (or ease) in whichbacklinksand other beneficial ranking materialscan be acquired for your website. While there are many generic links to provide to websites that will certainly aid in ranking, it's always best to acquire links relevant to the industry in which the business or website operates in. Off-Page SEO also incorporates things such as Social Media and sponsorship opportunities that can potentially help your website rank higher.\n\nAnSEO Industry Analysisgathers data about the industry that the website or business in question performs in, while looking specifically at competition level. Think about it: If there are 30 companies in San Francisco selling Hats and all these companies are performing SEO, ranking a website at the top of Google Results will be much more challenging than if only 10 companies in San Francisco sold Hats. Industry and Keyword competition is one of the most overlooked aspects of SEO, and without it any SEO Company will be unable to provide a realistictimelinefor ranking your website in the top Google search results.\n\nWe've discussed all the important elements of an SEO Audit and why you need one for your website.

CEO Tim Cook says his company will fight a federal magistrate's order to help the FBI hack into an encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino, California shooters. The company said that could potentially undermine encryption for millions of other users.\n\nCook's response, posted early Wednesday on the company's website, set the stage for a legal fight between the federal government and Silicon Valley with broad implications for digital privacy and national security.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym had ordered Apple to help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the shooters in the Dec. 2 attack that killed 14 people. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, died in a gun battle with police.\n\nThe ruling by Pym, a former federal prosecutor, requires Apple to supply software the FBI can load onto Farook's county-owned work iPhone to bypass a self-destruct feature that erases the phone's data after too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. The FBI wants to be able to try different combinations in rapid sequence until it finds the right one.\n\nThe Obama administration has embraced stronger encryption as a way to keep consumers safe on the Internet but has struggled to find a compelling example to make its case.\n\nCook called the ruling an example of government overreach and said \"this moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.\" He argued that the order \"has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\" He said it could undermine encryption by using specialized software to create an essential back door akin to a \"master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.\"\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,\" Cook wrote. \"The FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a back door. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors told Pym that they can't access Farook's work phone because they don't know his passcode and Apple has not cooperated. Under U.S. law, a work phone is generally the property of a person's employer. The magistrate judge told Apple in Tuesday's proceeding to provide an estimate of its cost to comply with her order, suggesting that the government will be expected to pay for the work.\n\nApple has provided default encryption on its iPhones since 2014, allowing any device's contents to be accessed only by the user who knows the phone's passcode. Previously, the company could use an extraction tool that would physically plug into the phone and allow it to respond to search warrant requests from the government.\n\nThe magistrate's order requires that the software Apple provides be programmed to work only on Farook's phone, and said Apple has five days to notify the court if it believes the ruling is unreasonably burdensome.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what investigators believe they might find on Farook's work phone or why the information would not be available from third-party service providers, such as Google or Facebook, though investigators think the device may hold clues about whom the couple communicated with and where they may have traveled.\n\nThe phone was running the newest version of Apple's iPhone operating system. It was configured to erase data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful unlocking attempts. The FBI said that feature appeared to be active on Farook's iPhone as of the last time he performed a backup.\n\nFarook and Malik took pains to physically destroy two personally owned cell phones, crushing them beyond the FBI's ability to recover information from them. They also removed a hard drive from their computer; it has not been found despite investigators diving for days for potential electronic evidence in a nearby lake.\n\nFarook was not carrying his work iPhone during the attack. It was discovered after a subsequent search.\n\nThe judge didn't spell out her rationale in her three-page order, but the ruling comes amid a similar case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n\nInvestigators are still working to piece together a missing 18 minutes in Farook and Malik's timeline from that day. Investigators have concluded they were at least partly inspired by the Islamic State group; Malik's Facebook page included a note pledging allegiance to the group's leader around the time of the attack.", "Instagram did not respond to our request for information about the reported new security feature. However, the new authentication option was confirmed yesterday in an article on TechCrunch.\n\nBy adding two-factor authentication, Instagram is offering users a way to better protect their account information and keep hackers from accessing their accounts. The feature works by having users verify their identities with a second step beyond the standard login, usually by inputting a code sent via text message to their cellphones.\n\n'It's About Time'\n\nCarbone called attention to the new feature in a February 7 post on his Wolf Millionaire blog. However, he updated the post the following day to note that the feature did not appear to be working smoothly and that users should enable it only at their own risk.\n\nWith well over 400 million users now, Instagram has become a growing target for hackers. Over the past few months, several celebrity accounts -- including those of former X-Factor contestant Chloe Khan and WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon -- have reportedly been targeted by attackers.\n\n\"It's about time Instagram took it's [sic] user accounts security seriously and rolled this feature out as a lifeline to secure our valuable accounts but we're going to have to be a little patient until it's completely bug proof so we don't get locked out of our own accounts,\" Carbone wrote in his blog post.\n\nMany Other Sites Offer 2FA\n\nGoogle, Twitter and Amazon are among other sites that have given users the option to secure their information with two-factor authentication. Facebook, which acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, has offered the feature -- called login approvals on its site -- for more than four years.\n\nInstagram recently encountered a different kind of security glitch after it introduced account switching earlier this month. The new capability, available for iOS and Android, allows users to add different Instagram accounts under one profile, enabling them to more easily switch from one to the other.\n\nShortly afterward, however, reports emerged that the new feature allowed some unauthorized users to view other people's Instagram notifications and messages. The issue was reportedly resolved as of Sunday, according to an update in Android Central.\n\nA study by the mobile identity company TeleSign last year found that a majority (70 percent) of people they surveyed didn't have \"a high degree of confidence\" in password-protected security. However, more than half (56 percent) said they were unfamiliar with two-factor authentication.\n\n\"Protecting online accounts with a simple username/password is simply not safe enough in today's environment,\" TeleSign senior vice president of marketing Brian Carny told us via a spokesperson.", "NEW YORK, Feb. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The context rich system market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.39% between 2015 and 2020.

Since the attack, authorities have been going through their belongings, including their smartphones, trying to determine their motives and whether they were part of a larger terrorist plot.\n\nIn posting his tweet, Snowden also retweeted a comment by WhiteHat Security founder Jeremiah Grossman that said, \"Today would be the perfect day for Sundar Pichai (Google, CEO) to back up Tim Cook (Apple, CEO).\"", "WASHINGTON: Apple's challenge of a court order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers opens up a new front in the long-running battle between technology companies and the government over encryption.\n\nThe standoff brings the sensitive issue, which has been at a stalemate in Congress, into the courts, and has abruptly shifted the policy debate on encryption.\n\nA California magistrate on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance\" to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to break into an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the deadly December rampage that killed 14 people and has been linked to supporters of the Islamic State organisation.\n\nApple quickly said it would fight the judge's order. Chief executive Tim Cook called it \"an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,\" and said the order \"has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\"\n\nApple, Google and other technology firms in recent years have stepped up encryption - allowing only the customers to have \"keys\" to unlock their devices - claiming improved security and privacy is needed to maintain confidence in the digital world.\n\nThat drive for privacy has prompted sharp objections from law enforcement and intelligence officials, who claim that criminals and extremists are able to hide their illicit activities thanks to device encryption.\n\n\"This is a clever move by the FBI to move from the legislative arena, where they were not winning, to the courts,\" said Joseph Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a digital rights group.\n\nRAISING PRIVACY HACKLES\n\nThe order raised hackles among privacy advocates, which see the potential to unleash unbridled surveillance in the United States and elsewhere. \"If the FBI can force Apple to hack into its customers' devices, then so too can every repressive regime in the rest of the world,\" said Alex Abdo of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nBut Apple also came under attack for thwarting a critical security investigation. \"Apple chose to protect a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people,\" said Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\n\"Regrettably, the position Tim Cook and Apple have taken shows that they are unwilling to compromise and that legislation is likely the only way to resolve this issue.\"\n\nNew York City police commissioner William Bratton welcomed the order and added, \"We cannot give those seeking to harm us additional tools to keep their activity secret. I reiterate my call on Congress to act immediately in passing legislation to provide law enforcement the tools we need to keep America safe.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman John Earnest said the White House supports the request by the FBI and Department of Justice. \"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters. They're simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\"\n\nDEBATE ON 1789 LAW\n\nThe case is likely to work its way through the courts, which will need to consider a number of both technical and legal questions.\n\nInterestingly, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym's order is based on the 1789 All Writs Act, which lays out broad authority for the courts to help enforcement of the law.\n\nSteve Vladeck, an American University law professor and co-editor of the Just Security blog, said the order stretches the interpretation of the centuries-old law.\n\n\"If the government can compel Apple to develop software (to get around encryption) what can't it do,\" Vladeck told AFP. \"There is no history of court orders compelling companies to do research and design.\"\n\nLegal scholar Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University said in a blog post that Pym \"seems to believe that she can order companies to become unwilling participants in surveillance research and development.\" \"I fail to see her legal basis for such an extraordinary order against a private company,\" Turley wrote.\n\nBerin Szoka, president of the libertarian think tank TechFreedom, said the order goes against \"bedrock principles of law and privacy.\"\n\n\"If forcing Apple to hack its own devices qualifies as 'reasonable technical assistance,' there is no practical limit to what law enforcement could force private companies to do to compromise the security of their systems,\" Szoka said in a statement.\n\nDarren Hayes, a Pace University professor of computer forensics, argued that Apple and other tech companies may have gone too far by using encryption that, in theory, makes it impossible for the firms to hand over evidence even if served with a legal warrant.\n\n\"I think that the public, once they become more educated about what is happening, might change their stance about Apple,\" said Hayes, who has worked as a consultant to law enforcement. \"This case is sensitive for the US public and I don't think it's particularly good public relations for Apple\" to refuse to help the investigation, Hayes added.\n\nOne key question is whether Apple has the ability to provide the assistance sought by the FBI. \"Apple does not have the keys to your device - they are burned onto your chip,\" Hall said.\n\nBut he said it may be possible to get around that encryption with software modifications. \"Apple has never been forthcoming about the deep details of its system,\" Hall said.\n\nHayes said that no one knows for sure if Apple can circumvent the encryption, but noted \"the fact that they're arguing this makes me think they may be able to do it.\"", "Founded in 2010, Google Ideas has been led by Washington, D.C.-insider-turned-Googler Jared Cohen, who will continue to lead Jigsaw as president.

The filing indicates that, in the future, it might instead terminate the fiber cable at an earlier point, then use the new wireless technology to deliver internet to nearby homes.\n\nIn September, Google applied for special temporary authority to expand testing in the 3.5 GHz band in Kansas City -- a frequency which the FCC recently designated for new licensed and unlicensed wireless broadband services -- and the company is now seeking to extend that authorization for 24 months.\n\nIt's also asking to expand its authorization to between 3400 and 3700 MHz (previously, the lowest frequency it asked for was 3550 MHz).\n\nIn the new heavily redacted filing with the Federal Communications Commission, Google discusses \"demonstrations of [REDACTED] experimental transmitters\" for its \"experimental broadband networks.\" The new filing is also the first time Google mentions access points and base stations that will communicate with \"end user devices,\" indicating that this isn't just some back-end technology that Google is testing.\n\nAlthough Google likely isn't building a full-fledged wireless service (the company recently said that it won't be bidding for the airwaves used by mobile carriers) the fact that its expanding its 3.5 GHz tests from current (Fiber-less) locations in Mountain View and Virginia to Kansas City mean it could be experimenting with a wireless \"last mile\" for Fiber.", "Founded in 2010, Google Ideas has been led by Washington, D.C.-insider-turned-Googler Jared Cohen, who will continue to lead Jigsaw as president.

(AP) -- The Tennessee Valley Authority said Wednesday that it is considering whether to sell its unfinished Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, started in 1974 in northeast Alabama and mothballed for the past 28 years without ever producing any electricity.\n\nThe federal utility announced it is taking public comments on whether to sell the 1,600-acre site on the Tennessee River near Hollywood, a town of about 1,000 people located 120 miles northeast of Birmingham.\n\nNo potential price was mentioned, but TVA said it has spent about $5 billion at Bellefonte.\n\nA purchaser would get two unfinished light-water nuclear reactors dating to the 1970s, transmission equipment, a helicopter landing pad, railroad lines, multiple buildings and parking lots.\n\nBellefonte could still be used for a nuclear power plant, the utility said, but it could also be used for industrial, commercial or residential developments.\n\n\"It's time we answer the question of whether TVA is serving the public well by retaining control of the Bellefonte site, or if others could make more beneficial use of it,\" TVA chief executive Bill Johnson said in a statement.\n\nThe public comment period ends March 18, and TVA directors will decide later whether to sell the site.\n\nThe utility last week killed a decade-old plan to construct two new nuclear reactors at Bellefonte, which was never completed as construction costs rose, demand for electricity flattened out and other forms of energy became more affordable.\n\nEnvironmentalists and clean-energy groups that have urged TVA to abandon Bellefonte said they were encouraged by the possible sale as long as another company doesn't try to use it for nuclear power.\n\n\"If someone is reckless enough to acquire the site and attempt to complete the Bellefonte 1 and 2 reactors with the existing, antiquated reactor design, we will aggressively oppose their efforts,\" said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.\n\nLast year, Google said it would construct a $600 million data center at the site of a former coal-fired electricity plant operated by TVA about 20 miles from Bellefonte.\n\nTVA is the nation's largest public utility. It provides electricity to about 9 million people in Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated with Authority officials now saying they have spent $5 billion, not $4 billion, at Bellefonte.", "A huge vulnerability in the GNU C Library (glibc) puts millions of systems at risk, giving hackers the opportunity to take control of Linux machines.\n\nWhat this entails is that cyber intruders could steal data and manipulate Linux computers that are connected to the Internet via remote code execution.

That means virtually anyone who uses this version of the GNU C Library is standing exposed to attacks.\n\nGoogle made a report concerning the problem, warning users to take proper measures.\n\n\"Our initial investigations showed that the issue affected all the versions of glibc since 2.9. You should definitely update if you are on an older version though. If the vulnerability is detected, machine owners may wish to take steps to mitigate the risk of an attack,\" Google says.\n\nThe company also notes that it will not release its exploit code, but along with the blog post, it has uploaded a Proof of Concept so that users will be able to check whether or not they are affected by the issue at hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Hat also reported the issue, releasing a patch that'll resolve it.\n\n\"A back of the envelope analysis shows that it should be possible to write correctly formed DNS responses with attacker controlled payloads that will penetrate a DNS cache hierarchy and therefore allow attackers to exploit machines behind such caches,\" Carlos O'Donnell, software engineer at Red Hat, says.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky Lab, Web frameworks such as Python, PHP and Rails and all Linux servers are affected. It's also worth mentioning that the flaw can have an impact on any other Unix-based operating system, including Android and iOS.\n\nGlibc is also the main reason behind the Ghost flaw that researchers found out a year ago, making this the second time that a huge vulnerability bared its fangs in the library.\n\nWhile the process is as simple as downloading and installing for other users, it may not be the case for users with apps that were compiled with the affected glibc.\n\nTo boil things down, every Linux user is advised to verify whether they're affected or not, and apply the patch as soon as possible.", "WASHINGTON - Feb. 16, 2016 - The U.S. intelligence chief acknowledged in testimony last week that it plans to include smart household devices to increase its surveillance capabilities. Household devices that are connected to the Internet - known as the \"Internet of Things\" - may offer consumers some added convenience in monitoring their home, and it may allow the government to increase its monitoring of households too.\n\n\"In the future, intelligence services might use the [Internet of Things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\" James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said in testimony to the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nThat said, the intelligence chief says that \"worldwide threats\" from terrorism as well as domestically \"homegrown extremists\" top its lists of greatest national security threats that may warrant such household monitoring.\n\n\"Security experts examining the Internet of Things take as a given that the U.S. and other surveillance services will intercept the signals the newly networked devices emit, much as they do with those from cellphones,\" The Guardian reports. \"Amateurs are already interested in easily compromised hardware; computer programmer John Matherly's search engine Shodan indexes thousands of completely unsecured web-connected devices.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House unveiled a new cybersecurity initiative that included a pledge to ramp up security for non-traditional networked home devices.

The reason you do not see that, if you don't, is because you have not done your homework. Like most African Americans, you have probably assumed that the democratic party is for our people so you must vote for one of the democratic candidates. But blind loyalty without objective research is ignorance - ignorance that will lead you to make a choice that is not in the best interest of our people.\n\nHillary Clinton supports Planned Parenthood and it has been reported that there are 1,000 African American babies killed in the womb every day. That reduces our population and we cannot afford that simply due to irresponsible or promiscuous men and women. Planned Parenthood was created by Margaret Sanger, a follower of Hitler and a believer in the \"master race\" theory. This agency was placed in the African American community to reduce our numbers and it has done just that by millions. Wake up. Then there is Benghazi and all the Clinton people who have been prosecuted. Pull up information on the Clintons. It's easy to find if you will look instead of just believing what she is telling you. Try Youtube or Google - and yes the info is verifiable. I dare you to seek the truth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=truth+about+the+clintons\n\nhttps://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=truth+about+the+clintons\n\nBernie Sanders is a Socialist, not a democratic. And even countries like Norway or Sweden who boast of democratic socialism have high taxes and poor economies overall. Our United States Constitution was not constructed to accommodate Socialism and it would actually hurt all three economic classes. Furthermore, Congress would fight the development of democratic socialism and Sanders could not do half the things he says he would do. Socialism gives the government far too much control over goods and products, eliminates competition and thus allows prices to go up on everything. Socialism also seeks to do away with private property ownership and play Robin Hood by taking what you have earned and giving it to someone who has done nothing. That is simply not fair. Hitler proclaimed himself a socialist. The former Soviet Union was a \"Socialist Republic\" and the people came last, after the government.\n\nThe reason many African Americans want Bernie Sanders is because they don't really know what socialism is. Therefore they simply believe what he tells them.\n\nYou may say you are left with few options and that you do not want to vote for a republican. Ironically, most African Americans over 45 in America are social conservatives based on moral values. So I suggest you do some research on your own, stop believing simply what the candidates tell you and vote based on morals, values and the African American need for spiritual principles in our lives. That means not voting for a candidate who supports or promotes homosexuality, the killing of our unborn children by the thousands or big government controlling our lives and paying our people off with food stamps, welfare and WIC.\n\nYou do not have to agree with me, but you should do your own research. If you do, you will find out what I have said is true, like it or not. There is a reason Frederick Douglass was a Republican. There is a reason Martin Luther King Jr. was a REPUBLICAN. The democratic party was the slave party of the south and they still try to control you with big government today. They pay our people off with entitlement programs because they really think African Americans cannot make it on our own. The democratic party serves as the parent and too many African Americans act like their children. Wake up!\n\nYou may say \"the Republicans are crooked\", but of which ones do you speak? And if you say \"all of them\", you likely don't know that - you are simply repeating what you have heard. Do your research on them as well but don't assume without evidence and the facts. Then vote accordingly.\n\nIf you disagree, let's debate the facts - not opinions. But do your research first and know that I am coming with hard evidence to pull the cloak off of the democratic deception. I am not a sellout - I am a man who is wide awake, who does his homework, who finds the facts and who cannot be bought off. Your finances, your health and your success are up to you and you do not need a democratic party to think for you unless you have gotten too lazy to think and make decisions for yourself.

So, we're delighted to be able to give these emerging thinkers a unique platform to tell their stories.\"\n\n\"This is the perfect route for a world-first. We all know about the impact of the California tech boom, but what's really exciting is the growing number of Australians doing business with Silicon Valley on the one hand, and building a home-grown Australian culture of entrepreneurialism on the other,\" she said.\n\nWirth further explained that the reason for the relaunch of flights between Sydney and San Francisco was to support growing business travel driven by the recent tech boom.\n\n\"[W]e're looking forward to playing our part in strengthening the ties between innovators on both sides of the Pacific,\" she added.\n\nTEDxSydney Founder Remo Giuffr\u00e9 said before the event: \"Some of the most exciting speakers from TEDxSydney alumni will be sharing their ideas at 30,000 feet while members of our extended networks are anticipating some serious meeting and greeting in the Bay Area next week.\"\n\nThe group of Australian start-ups travelling on the flight will tour the world headquarters of tech giants Google, Twitter, Facebook, Khan Academy and Silicon Valley Bank.

Why does the U.S. government need Apple's help?\n\nA. The government wants Apple to provide technical assistance to help it break into Farook's phone. Apple's mobile operating system encrypts virtually all of its data so that forensics experts cannot access email, text messages, photos or other information unless they enter a password.\n\nThe phone requires two digital \"keys\" to unscramble the data: a passcode entered by the user when they want to use the device and a unique 256-bit AES key that is coded into the hardware during manufacture. The hardware key cannot be removed from the device, which prevents hackers from copying the contents of its hard drive and then cracking the passcode with the help of powerful computers.\n\nApple's mobile iOS system offers an auto-erase function that will wipe the device after 10 failed attempts to unlock it. The government says it is not sure if Farook enabled that function but has not attempted to unlock it because it does not want to risk losing the data.\n\nQ. What exactly does the government want Apple to do?\n\nA. The government has asked Apple to create a new version of iOS that disables the auto-erase function. It also requested the new software circumvent a feature that causes delays of up to one hour when nine wrong passwords are entered - making it possible to break into the phone using the \"brute force\" method of trying millions of different passwords. The government says it is possible for Apple to create software that will only work on the device used by Farook.\n\nQ. What are Apple's objections?\n\nA. Apple says that such a tool would essentially create a \"backdoor\" that could be used by the FBI or others to break into any iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a letter to customers, cited the possibility of the specially created software falling into the \"wrong hands\" and rejected the notion that it would only be used in this single case.\n\nCook also said that the move would establish a dangerous precedent. \"The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge,\" he said.\n\nQ. Is Apple right?\n\nA. It is not clear why Apple would worry about the specially created software being stolen or misused, since the work would take place in Apple's labs and would presumably be no more subject to theft than any other Apple software. Apple is known for its strong security and there are no known incidents of its source code or cryptographic keys being stolen.\n\nFurther, the same technique would not work on devices launched after the 5c because they are equipped with a chip known as \"Secure Enclave,\" which helps encrypt data using both the password and a unique user ID that is provisioned during manufacturing and not known to Apple.\n\nThe bigger concern is the precedent. If Apple complied, it would mark the first time a software company created a tool to break into its own products in response to an order from law enforcement. Technology companies and privacy advocates fear an endless stream of similar requests - not just from the U.S. government, but also from foreign governments and even litigants in civil cases. Technologists are horrified by the very idea of deliberately creating software that undermines security.\n\nQ. Why is practical compromise impossible here?\n\nA. Apple is drawing a line in the sand to avoid setting a precedent.\n\nQ. What information is the government seeking?\n\nA. Prosecutors say they believe data on the phone could help determine who Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik communicated with as they planned the shootings, where they traveled to before and after the attack, and other details about the attack.\n\nQ. Will all the data the government wants be on the device?\n\nA. Not necessarily. Even if the government is right in its assumption that the phone was used to plan that attack, Farook may have used encrypted apps that wipe all evidence of communications. For example, Islamic State uses an mobile messaging service known as Telegram for propaganda and recruitment. The service allows the group to broadcast messages to large numbers of followers, then move to private, one-to-one encrypted messaging that likely cannot be retrieved by forensics experts.\n\nQ. Are there similar issues with Android devices?\n\nA. Smartphones powered by Google's Android operating system offer a variety of encryption options, depending on the manufacturer and model. Forensic technicians can \"bypass\" passcodes on some of the devices, according to a November report by Manhattan's district attorney. Google can remotely reset the passcodes, when served with a search warrant and an order instructing them to assist law enforcement to extract data, allowing authorities to view contents of a device.\n\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)", "A local company used 3-D technology to create a virtual tour of the Boca Express Train Museum\n\nIt can be held in your hand, but it contains technology capable of capturing eight decades of history.\n\nThe 12-by-6-inch black box is a high-tech 3-D camera that Pompano Beach startup AccuTour used to create a virtual tour of the Boca Express Train Museum at 747 S.

Science fiction is shaping the language that companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets, and even defining long-term goals for developers.\n\n\"Science fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,\" said Ralph Osterhout, CEO of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses.\n\nPerhaps no fictional work resonates more throughout the industry these days than \"Ready Player One,\" written by Ernest Cline and being made into a movie by Steven Spielberg.\n\nMuch of the action in the book takes place inside the Oasis, a global virtual reality network. Characters in the network attend school, socialize and take part in a high-stakes treasure hunt. Through virtual reality, they can inhabit the perspectives of actors in classic movies.\n\nThe book was published in 2011, around the time Luckey began building an early prototype of the Oculus headset. Luckey said he appreciated Cline's portrayals of characters controlling their avatars through full-body suits rather than plugging \"Matrix\"-style cables into their brains.\n\n\"One of the things I like about 'Ready Player One' is all of the depictions in the book are pretty feasible,\" Luckey said. \"None of it is crazy, far-out tech.\"\n\nOculus gave out 3,000 copies of the book to people attending an Oculus developer conference last year. For good measure, Oculus named the meeting rooms at its headquarters after famous fictional versions of virtual reality, including the holodeck, the Oasis and the Matrix, from the movie of the same name and, before that, William Gibson's \"Neuromancer.\"\n\nCline said he wrote \"Ready Player One\" partly because he could not figure out why virtual reality had not taken off in the real world.\n\n\"I think that was the same impulse that drove Palmer,\" said Cline, who has visited Oculus several times to speak to employees. \"Growing up with 'Neuromancer' and Max Headroom, it had the same effect on me as a writer as it did on businesspeople.\"\n\nTechies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. Throw a rock in Silicon Valley and you are likely to hit a software engineer who can cite how long it took the Millennium Falcon to make the Kessel Run in \"Star Wars.\" (Less than 12 parsecs, according to Han Solo, whose use of a term for distance -- one parsec equals about 3.26 light-years -- rather than time has been the subject of entire articles.) The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration.\n\nBut there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace -- and often someone -- they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters.\n\nWriters on staff\n\nMagic Leap in Dania Beach, Fla., which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his 1992 novel \"Snow Crash.\"\n\nStephenson -- whose title is chief futurist -- declined to say what he is working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several \"content projects\" under way at the company.\n\nMore broadly, Stephenson said science fiction books and movies are often useful within tech companies for rallying employees around a shared vision.\n\n\"My theory is that science fiction can actually have some value in that it gets everyone on the same page without the kind of expensive and tedious process of PowerPoint,\" he said.\n\nBut the influence of the genre within tech companies is \"surprising and mysterious to me as well,\" he added.\n\nDystopian aspects\n\nThere is a regular theme in science fiction that its fans in tech talk less about, though: the dystopian aspects of virtual reality. Addiction, disconnection from relationships in the real world and alienation from the environment are often side effects in narratives about virtual reality. It is hard to make that into a selling point for the technology.\n\n\"Entrepreneurs are optimistic and upbeat by nature, which is why I enjoy hanging around with them,\" Stephenson said. \"They've got an admirable ability to completely ignore the more dystopian elements you're talking about and see the cool stuff and positive potential of where it might go.\"\n\nOf course, authors and filmmakers get to overlook details of their own -- like the tough technological challenges that real tech companies face.\n\n\"You never have to reboot the damned thing\" in sci-fi books, said Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist who works at Intel and has written about the interplay between technology and science fiction. \"The mechanics are less interesting to most science fiction writers than the experience.\"\n\nSometimes science fiction plants seeds in the minds of inventors that take years to sprout. The holographic chess game that Chewbacca played on a tabletop aboard the Millennium Falcon was pretty far-out in the 1970s, when Jeri Ellsworth saw it in the original \"Star Wars.\" It took several decades before technology caught up.\n\nIn 2013, Ellsworth's startup, CastAR, gave the first public demonstration of the company's augmented reality glasses, which overlay digital imagery on the user's view of the real world.\n\nBy now, the experience shown in the demonstration should come as no surprise -- the glasses enabled the person wearing them to play a holographic chess game on a tabletop.\n\n\"It's something I've been dreaming about my entire life,\" Ellsworth said.", "\"Well, somebody has to arrange the matches,\n\nYoung people can't decide these things themselves.\"\n\n-- Fiddler on the Roof\n\nWOODBURY >> If you haven't found your sweetheart yet, fret not.

It would have been fantastic before the Internet. I kind of don't care either way. It's kind of amusing that we're hard to find, and it's not like people around the country are rushing to their computers to hunt down 'Milwaukee band WORK.'\"\n\nWORK is worth hunting down. The simple, simmering post-punk works well with Cannon's smart yet desperate lyrics, delivered loosely, almost like spoken word.\n\nIt's reminiscent at times of the Hold Steady's literary frontman Craig Finn.\n\nProblem is, if people did a search for \"Milwaukee band WORK,\" they wouldn't find any web pages about the trio. So skip Google entirely and go to facebook.com/workmke or workmke.bandcamp.com.\n\nEarly influences: I was a high school nerd who realized the punks partied and were way more interesting than the jocks. So I discovered bands like the Damned and Bauhaus, and was growing up in D.C. in the late '80s when the hard-core scene was exploding.\n\nI had the fortune of seeing Fugazi like 100 times. I've played in a bizarre array of bands, from garage punk to country to math to hard core. My propensity is to play loud, fast and weird.\n\nAbout the band's name: I used to teach philosophy when I moved to Milwaukee, at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and at Marquette.\n\nOne of the students had referred to the end of the semester push to produce papers as \"descending into the work hole.\" So I thought \"work hole\" was a great name for something and then one day I thought, \"What about just WORK?\"\n\nWhen WORK formed: Our first practice was April 2013. When I was married to (local artist) Lady Cannon, she used to host dinners and I got to be friends with these guys in the context of that.\n\nThey played in approximately 83 bands in Milwaukee, but I was able to seduce them away from other projects.\n\nThe stories behind the songs: Sometimes they're kind of fantastical. Usually there's a germ of something that happened to me where I jump off in a different direction.\n\nThe initial spate of songs tended to be about the end of my marriage and the end of my academic career, and there was some bitterness in those lyrics.\n\nNow they're going into a more purely storytelling direction where I'm not exorcising my demons anymore, and the songs on the new album, there's a little bit more excitement to them.\n\nFavorite songs on \"Doing the Lords\":\"These Girls Air Ghosts.\" Nerd alert, the title's taken from a quote from [William] Faulkner; it was his way of doing dialect.\n\nThere's an evil little chuckle on it and I'm singing about doing the \"push, push, push,\" whatever that means. It's vaguely sinister and exciting.\n\nAnd the last song on the record, \"Put It In,\" which was the first one we wrote for the record, I like quite a bit. It's very short, very sweet, and the rhythmic ideas in it are kind of out of left field, but it still coheres well as a song.\n\nDescribe the live show: We try to hurt ourselves. I'm always joking that I come from the '90s where there was a real premium put on live performance. I just remember going to see shows and having my ears peeled back.

The government wants Apple to provide technical assistance to help it break into Farook's phone. Apple's mobile operating system encrypts virtually all of its data so that forensics experts cannot access email, text messages, photos or other information unless they enter a password.\n\nThe phone requires two digital \"keys\" to unscramble the data: a passcode entered by the user when they want to use the device and a unique 256-bit AES key that is coded into the hardware during manufacture. The hardware key cannot be removed from the device, which prevents hackers from copying the contents of its hard drive and then cracking the passcode with the help of powerful computers.\n\nApple's mobile iOS system offers an auto-erase function that will wipe the device after 10 failed attempts to unlock it. The government says it is not sure if Farook enabled that function but has not attempted to unlock it because it does not want to risk losing the data.\n\nQ. What exactly does the government want Apple to do?\n\nA. The government has asked Apple to create a new version of iOS that disables the auto-erase function. It also requested the new software circumvent a feature that causes delays of up to one hour when nine wrong passwords are entered - making it possible to break into the phone using the \"brute force\" method of trying millions of different passwords. The government says it is possible for Apple to create software that will only work on the device used by Farook.\n\nA. Apple says that such a tool would essentially create a \"backdoor\" that could be used by the FBI or others to break into any iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a letter to customers, cited the possibility of the specially created software falling into the \"wrong hands\" and rejected the notion that it would only be used in this single case.\n\nCook also said that the move would establish a dangerous precedent. \"The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge,\" he said.\n\nA. It is not clear why Apple would worry about the specially created software being stolen or misused, since the work would take place in Apple's labs and would presumably be no more subject to theft than any other Apple software. Apple is known for its strong security and there are no known incidents of its source code or cryptographic keys being stolen.\n\nFurther, the same technique would not work on devices launched after the 5c because they are equipped with a chip known as \"Secure Enclave,\" which helps encrypt data using both the password and a unique user ID that is provisioned during manufacturing and not known to Apple.\n\nThe bigger concern is the precedent. If Apple complied, it would mark the first time a software company created a tool to break into its own products in response to an order from law enforcement. Technology companies and privacy advocates fear an endless stream of similar requests - not just from the U.S. government, but also from foreign governments and even litigants in civil cases. Technologists are horrified by the very idea of deliberately creating software that undermines security.\n\nA. Apple is drawing a line in the sand to avoid setting a precedent.\n\nA. Prosecutors say they believe data on the phone could help determine who Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik communicated with as they planned the shootings, where they traveled to before and after the attack, and other details about the attack.\n\nQ. Will all the data the government wants be on the device?\n\nA. Not necessarily. Even if the government is right in its assumption that the phone was used to plan that attack, Farook may have used encrypted apps that wipe all evidence of communications. For example, Islamic State uses an mobile messaging service known as Telegram for propaganda and recruitment. The service allows the group to broadcast messages to large numbers of followers, then move to private, one-to-one encrypted messaging that likely cannot be retrieved by forensics experts.\n\nA. Smartphones powered by Google's Android operating system offer a variety of encryption options, depending on the manufacturer and model. Forensic technicians can \"bypass\" passcodes on some of the devices, according to a November report by Manhattan's district attorney. Google can remotely reset the passcodes, when served with a search warrant and an order instructing them to assist law enforcement to extract data, allowing authorities to view contents of a device.\n\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)", "Since Edward Snowden revealed the full scale of the mass surveillance being carried out by the National Security Agency (NSA) at the behest of the U.S. government, encryption has been a hot button issue for tech companies. Apple and Google led the wave by encrypting all iOS and Android smartphones, and both companies have stood up to the federal government multiple times to defend encryption and the privacy of their millions of users.\n\n\"We are challenging the FBI's demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country.\"\n\nApple's CEO Tim Cook has been more vocal than most, and his stance on privacy and encryption is nothing short of revolutionary. He is the first major tech CEO to stand up and declare that encryption and privacy on the Internet is a \"fundamental right.\" He's led countless discussions on the importance of encryption and warned about the dangers of creating backdoors in technology products for the government -- and the bad guys, Cook reasons -- to get in when they please. Now, Cook is taking the battle for privacy and encryption on the Internet to an entirely new level.\n\nRelated: Tim Cook is right about privacy and encryption: We shouldn't give them up for Google\n\nHe has denied a court order and an FBI demand to disable the iPhone's auto-erase function, which removes all data from a device after 10 failed attempts to break into it. But it's not just any phone that has Cook fuming: It's the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, the San Bernadino shooter who gunned down 14 people and is suspected of having ISIS sympathies. The decision to say no to the court's order to reveal the contents of Farook's phone is a very serious one, which will likely have major consequences for the tech world and for Apple.\n\nIn a brave letter to Apple's customers, Tim Cook explains why he opposes the court's order and levels with users about the importance of taking a stand for encryption and privacy. He states that the FBI is asking \"for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\"\n\nCook adds that while Apple has worked closely with the FBI to try and find out more information about \"this horrible crime,\" Apple cannot and will not create a backdoor on the iPhone.\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software - which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,\" he writes. \"We are challenging the FBI's demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.\"\n\nRead the full text of Tim Cook's statement to customers:\n\nFebruary 16, 2016\n\nA Message to Our Customers\n\nThe United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\n\nThis moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.\n\nThe Need for Encryption\n\nSmartphones, led by iPhone, have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going.\n\nAll that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.\n\nCompromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk. That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.\n\nFor many years, we have used encryption to protect our customers' personal data because we believe it's the only way to keep their information safe. We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.\n\nThe San Bernardino Case\n\nWe were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino last December. We mourn the loss of life and want justice for all those whose lives were affected. The FBI asked us for help in the days following the attack, and we have worked hard to support the government's efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists.\n\nWhen the FBI has requested data that's in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we've offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.\n\nWe have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.\n\nSpecifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\n\nThe FBI may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: Building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor. And while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control.\n\nThe Threat to Data Security\n\nSome would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution. But it ignores both the basics of digital security and the significance of what the government is demanding in this case.\n\nIn today's digital world, the \"key\" to an encrypted system is a piece of information that unlocks the data, and it is only as secure as the protections around it. Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge.\n\nThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks -- from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable.\n\nThe government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers -- including tens of millions of American citizens -- from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe.\n\nWe can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.\n\nA Dangerous Precedent\n\nRather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.\n\nThe government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by \"brute force,\" trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.\n\nThe implications of the government's demands are chilling. If the government can use the All Writs Act to make it easier to unlock your iPhone, it would have the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data. The government could extend this breach of privacy and demand that Apple build surveillance software to intercept your messages, access your health records or financial data, track your location, or even access your phone's microphone or camera without your knowledge.\n\nOpposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government.\n\nWe are challenging the FBI's demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. We believe it would be in the best interest of everyone to step back and consider the implications.\n\nWhile we believe the FBI's intentions are good, it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products. And ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\n\nTim Cook\n\nAlso watch: Hitman 2016 Beta Launches Tomorrow, Are You Ready?", "It's a bird, it's a plane, it's ... an Internet-delivering balloon. This year, Google is piloting Project Loon, a program that plans to launch high-flying balloons into the stratosphere to fly over developing countries and connect people in remote areas with Internet access.\n\nAlphabet X (formerly known as Google X), the division which develops some of the company's more ambitious and groundbreaking projects, spotlighted the program at the annual TED conference in Vancouver this week, Re/Code reports.\n\nProject Loon has gone through a lot of trial-and-error testing, and Alphabet X lab chief Astro Teller told the TED crowd that \"we busted a lot of balloons\" in the process. The first test flight took place in 2013 when a balloon was launched over New Zealand. More tests have been conducted in California and Brazil.\n\nNow, the project is being tested in earnest. On Monday, the first of three planned test balloons entered Sri Lankan airspace. Back in October, Alphabet announced that Project Loon would soon make its presence known in the skies over Indonesia, as well.\n\nAt TED, Teller said the project's balloons are able to deliver roughly 15 megabits-per-second Web access -- enough to support video content -- an improvement over earlier connections.\n\nThe technology is fairly simple. The Alphabet balloons travel through the stratosphere -- twice as high as airplanes -- powered along by wind currents. Telecommunication companies partnering with the tech company share their cellular spectrum, giving people on the ground the chance to connect to the balloon network from their wireless, LTE-enabled devices. This cellular signal passes along the balloon network and then is transmitted back down to users below, according to the project's website.\n\nSo, what's next for this project? The company says it's in talks with various carriers globally, and projects that more than five billion people will have Web access in the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"It will change the world in ways we cannot possibly imagine,\" Teller added.", "Dell's DSS 9000 rack architecture will allow customers to decouple storage and computing resources\n\nDell is bringing the advantages of its enterprise-level hyperscale rack servers to a wider range of customers.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress next week, Dell will show off its new DSS 9000 hyperscale rack architecture, a server technology that allows computing and storage resources to be decoupled. The new rack design, aimed at mid-sized to large businesses, is based on Intel's Rack Scale Architecture, which is meant to bring configuration flexibility and power efficiency to Web-scale tasks.\n\nThe DSS 9000 will ship in the second half this year, Dell said.\n\nThe hyperscale architecture is already available to Dell's largest customers through the company's DCS (Data Center Solutions and Services) division. The architectural blueprint will be made available to mid-range hyperscale customers through the recently formed DSS (Datacenter Scaleable Solutions) group.\n\nThe new architecture is targeted toward customers planning to install a few thousand servers, said Stephen Rousset, distinguished engineer and director of architecture at Dell's Extreme Scale Infrastructure group. Installing the rack architecture in an existing data center can be difficult, he said, but changes in server implementations often happen gradually.\n\nGiant companies like Google and Facebook buy thousands of hyperscale servers, which include networking, storage and computing resources. Hyperscale computing allows businesses to quickly provision and add computing resources, and Dell's new rack architecture gives businesses the flexibility to decouple storage and computing resources, such as processors and memory, in separate racks, or pools.\n\nCustomers can configure a rack depending on how much power consumption, processing capabilities or storage they want to assign, Rousset said. The compute and storage cartridges then can be assembled in a rack. Power and cooling resources are shared between the cartridges.\n\nOne rack can hold up to 80 compute modules or 40 storage modules. Storage and compute modules can also be combined in a rack. Racks have multiple networking switches and power bays.\n\nThe compute cartridges will use two-socket motherboards with 16 DIMM slots for DRAM. Only x86 server processors are supported for now, Rousset said.\n\nAmong the advantages of the architecture: With computing resources closer to each other, processing of Web services can be easily scaled up, and there's more flexibility to provision storage, Rousset said.\n\nIntel has been pushing silicon photonics as a key part of its Rack Scale Architecture. Optics are a way to connect racks over long distances, but copper for now is a \"cost effective answer\" for connections within the rack, Rousset said.\n\nDell will make the DSS 9000 rack scale architecture available worldwide, Rousset said.\n\nFollow Us TwitterLinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

Among the high-profile hires were Katie Couric and former New York Times technology writer David Pogue.\n\nDuring her tenure, the company also has spent billions of dollars on acquisitions. But neither the addition of high-price talent nor Yahoo's M&A strategy has delivered the kind of growth that investors demand.\n\nIn an online posting Wednesday, Martha Nelson, the pioneer portal's global editor-in-chief, said Yahoo would begin phasing out online magazines including: Yahoo Food, Yahoo Health, Yahoo Parenting, Yahoo Makers, Yahoo Travel, Yahoo Autos and Yahoo Real Estate.\n\nThe moves come as Yahoo focuses its efforts on its four more successful content areas: news, sports, finance and lifestyle, Nelson said.\n\n\"As we make these changes, we acknowledge the talent and dedication of an extraordinary group of journalists who brought new and newsworthy content to Yahoo,\" Nelson wrote.\n\n\"We are not sharing specific numbers, however we did announce on our earnings call we will be reducing our workforce by 15 percent overall,\" Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark emailed.\n\nEarlier this month, Mayer laid out her plan to reduce costs and increase growth, including a 15 percent cut in the workforce.\n\nThe Internet company also reported a 15 percent decline in adjusted quarterly revenue amid lost ground in online search and display advertising. Internet users these days are more inclined to click to Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's Google (GOOG).\n\nYahoo Tech editor-in-chief Dan Tynan, who joined that unit as a columnist in December 2013 and was named to his latest position in July 2015, was reportedly among those getting a pink slip.\n\nPolitico cited a source familiar with the matter in reporting that Yahoo was ending its tech vertical and transferring some of its staff -- including the newly arrived Pogue -- to Yahoo's news vertical.", "The newest street-style fashion star has been photographed dining at Balthazar and Nobu, shopping at Barneys, vacationing in Marrakesh and the Napa Valley and going to the ballet in London. She favors Chlo\u00e9, Marc Jacobs and Zara, and seems to have an occasional fondness for the color pink.\n\nAnd she is 4 years old.\n\nHer name is Harper Seven Beckham, and if you didn't already know, she is the daughter and youngest child of Victoria and David Beckham.\n\nShe was at her mother's fashion show on a frigid Sunday morning in New York this week, sitting in the front row with her father, the retired soccer star, and her three brothers, Cruz, 10; Romeo, 13; and Brooklyn, 16 -- the latter two also budding fashionistas. (Romeo has starred in a Burberry ad campaign shot by Mario Testino, and Brooklyn is a sometime model and aspiring fashion photographer.)\n\nHarper was clad in a black bespoke Burberry winter coat that had been chosen for her by the Burberry creative director Christopher Bailey and a pair of black patent leather loafers by Gucci, her hair styled into two glossy braids. As the British newspaper The Sun put it in its report about Ms. Beckham's New York Fashion Week show: \"Harper Beckham steals show.\"\n\nMuch like kindergarten contemporaries North West and Prince George, whose celebrity parents also command a global cult following, Harper has garnered a multimillion-strong army of admiring fans on Instagram and other social media platforms thanks to her impeccable outfits.\n\nShe has been featured on the websites of British Vogue and Elle UK and is the subject of a full-time blog devoted to chronicling her every look, titled simply enough, \"Harper Beckham.\"\n\n\"Goodness, a full-time blog just on her, does she really?\" said her mother, Victoria Beckham, who was interviewed backstage after the show, with her family and well-wishers milling around. \"That's quite amazing. I had no idea. And perhaps a little odd.\"\n\nMs. Beckham added: \"I suppose it says a lot about the world we are living in today. And yet it doesn't surprise me. Harper is incredibly chic -- especially this morning in that coat from Christopher, and wears some incredibly sweet things. She's a very stylish little thing with her own sense of how she wants to dress. She tends to choose exactly what she wears herself.\"\n\nThere seems to be a booming trend for designer children's wear (some of Harper's outfits come from labels like Little Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney Kids), making the wearers look more like mini-versions of their parents rather than rapidly developing toddlers and adolescents who will soon outgrow those expensive designer duds.\n\nThe premium brands that regularly feature in the wardrobes of pint-size A-list offspring, and the retailers that sell them, are reaping the rewards. Net-a-Porter has registered the domain name Petite-a-Porter, and Harrods of London recently expanded its children's wear department to 66,000 square feet. When a figure like Harper is spotted wearing one outfit, brands say, sales can skyrocket and pieces sell out only hours after a photograph appears online.\n\n\"Our loyal customers are always interested in seeing who is wearing our clothes, and we do find that the clothes worn by Harper sell very quickly,\" said Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, creative director of the luxury children's label Marie-Chantal in London. Pink velvet party dresses from the brand sell for around $280, while a pillar-box red coat with a bow collar costs $395.\n\n\"Victoria has been a great supporter over the years, and Harper has been wearing Marie-Chantal since she was a baby,\" the princess said. \"We are so happy that Harper still loves wearing our clothes even as she gets older.\" (The Harper Beckham blog lists 31 times that Harper has been photographed in Marie-Chantal.)\n\nEleanor Robinson, head of accessories and children's wear at Selfridges, said last week that best-selling designer items in recent seasons for the upmarket British department store have included a Burberry trench worn by Romeo Beckham, Pink Dr. Martens and Charlotte Olympia kitty flats seen on North West; and items by Chlo\u00e9, Bonpoint and Little Marc Jacobs that Harper has been spotted wearing.\n\n\"Here in the United Kingdom especially, there is this very British sense of pride with celebrities and their children, and in particular with the Beckhams and Princess Catherine and Prince William,\" Ms. Robinson said. \"These are family role models who dress their children beautifully, and consumers aspire to replicate this personal sense of style that also reinforces positive family ideals. Children's wear has become an increasingly important part of our fashion business.\"\n\nThe person who runs the Harper Beckham fashion site, Anastasia Medvedeva, is a blogger based in the San Francisco Bay Area. She said the site got about 3,000 hits a day and was an \"unremarkable\" moneymaker, deriving its income from a few Google ads. \"I first started eight years ago with a fashion blog about Suri Cruise because I loved her style when she was little, and have been a lifelong fan of Victoria Beckham, so a focus on Harper was a natural progression,\" she wrote in an email. \"Harper is very popular because of who her parents are and their personal style.\"\n\nDespite the haute fashion pieces Harper sported supporting her mother at the Sunday show, another apparent factor behind her breakout street-style star status is the quota of items she wears that are affordable for the general public, Ms. Medvedeva wrote, making copying her looks more accessible for many parents.\n\nThough the Bonpoint and Chlo\u00e9 dresses frequently worn by Harper can range from $100 to $250, Ms. Medvedeva wrote, she can often be seen in emerging brands like Billieblush, Gardner and the Gang, and Courage & Kind, which are relatively more affordable.\n\nHow aware Harper is of her style supernova status remains to be seen. She will return to school next week in London after her half-term break. But her mother said she doubted the attention would deter Harper from continuing to wear her consistently favorite item.\n\n\"More than anything,\" Ms. Beckham said, \"she loves her football jersey.\"", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSounding off on Apple vs. government\n\nA federal judge has ordered Apple to help the FBI break into an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Wochit\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- It's the Crypto Wars all over again.\n\nNo, we aren't referencing a new tech-infused installment of Star Wars, but the biggest legal issue facing the tech industry in at least a decade -- one that will likely end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, with eight or nine justices.\n\nApple is defying a federal court order to help the FBI unlock an iPhone used by one of the assailants in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif. in December. The pro-consumer, pro-privacy stance reflects a growing sentiment and fear in Silicon Valley: unfettered access by officials to reams of data for millions of smartphone owners. This was underscored by a meeting between tech executives and the federal government, over the importance of security and encryption, in Silicon Valley. (By comparison, the general public, by a 53%-47% margin, supports the government, according to a CNN poll of 3,500 people on Wednesday.)\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSnowden backs Apple in fight over iPhone, calls on Google to speak up\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, in a letter, framed the brouhaha simply and bravely: Compliance with the FBI, he correctly argued, would undermine the privacy and integrity of every iPhone user's data -- not just from government surveillance but hackers. \"Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,\" he wrote.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCook: FBI asking us to build backdoor to iPhone\n\nThe ramifications are sobering. At stake is the very core of people's identities, if Apple were to cave to the FBI's wishes.\n\n\"This really speaks to the degree to which technology has permeated our lives. Silicon Valley has been at the core of modern life for a long time, but people are now more deeply aware,\" says Leslie Berlin, historian for Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University. \"Think of the sense of panic when you can't find a phone, which is like our brain in our hands. Now imagine all your personal data -- passwords, phone numbers, Social Security number - in the hands of the federal government. That is terrifying.\"\n\nOpening a digital backdoor would let governments -- don't just think the U.S., but foreign governments such as China, nation-states and hackers -- sidestep privacy protections and create technological weaknesses. But it wouldn't measurably help law enforcement investigate crimes; no government agency has evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nAnother wild card: Apple has no choice. If it does not stand up to the U.S. government, it risks \"blowing the market\" in China, says Paul Saffo, a futurist based in Silicon Valley. \"It cannot cave because it has made such an emphasis on protecting the consumer.\"\n\nIf this sounds vaguely familiar flash back a few decades to the 1990s, when the U.S. computer community was convulsed with what at the time were called the Crypto Wars. At the time, the federal government classified strong encryption software as munitions, much as missiles or other weapons, and banned its export.\n\nFor several years, some companies produced two versions of their programs: one for sale inside the USA with strong encryption and one for sale elsewhere with weaker encryption. These export controls weren't relaxed until 1996.\n\nA California judge says Apple must help federal investigators crack the password protection on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nIndeed, Apple's face-off with the FBI has prompted leading voices in the valley to dust off the \"Crypto Wars\" phrase. \"This is the first large-scale example of the crypto argument,\" says Neil Richards, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThe long-simmering debate picked up paranoia in late 2013, when National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed extensive surveillance operations -- sometimes with the cooperation of tech firms. On Wednesday, Snowden lent his support for Apple in a series of tweets, and asked for Google to speak up.\n\nThe NSA episode, ostensibly, applied to those suspected of criminal activity. Apple, which has sold more than 750 million iPhones, is another matter.\n\n\"For the first time, an ordinary consumer can see themselves in the picture,\" Saffo says. \"Before, it was the problem of policy geeks... (Apple's fight) has been dropped right in the laps of millions of consumers.\"\n\nAmericans' historically naive notion of privacy could change dramatically when they realize their coveted iPhone could be viewed by the prying eyes of others. It's a national discussion that is likely to played out in social media -- not mass media -- with Apple making it case to the public forum, Saffo says.\n\nSteve Jobs may be gone, but his spirit is alive and well. With its actions, the company is reminding some of its 1984 ad, when a hammer-wielding heroine hurled her weapon at Big Brother.\n\nSwartz, USA TODAY's San Francisco bureau chief, has covered Silicon Valley for more than 25 years.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TrnsDy", "Cash levels among the world's fund managers are at their highest level since the tech wreck, a clear \"buy\" signal, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe bank's February Global Fund Manager Survey found that average cash balances of the 198 surveyed were as high as 5.6 per cent, at their highest point since November 2001 in the wake of the dotcom bubble burst, global energy giant Enron's collapse and the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe elevated cash levels are a buy signal according to the survey's \"cash rule\". A cash level above 4.5 per cent indicated fund managers should buy, while a level below 3.5 per cent was a sell recommendation.\n\nThe fund managers, which collectively manage $US591 billion also turned sharply negative on global economic growth in February following one of the worst starts to the year in history for global shares.\n\nOf the respondents, 16 per cent now expect a weaker economy in 2016, the most negative reading in five years.\n\nMeanwhile, expectations for Chinese growth are at their lowest since 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as a rise in cash, investors looked to capital preservation, flocking to bonds, utility and telecommunication stocks and out of banking stocks, while putting some faith back in emerging market shares, the survey found.\n\n\"Investors have reset expectations for macro and markets lower and see default/recession as a risk rather than a reality,\" chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said.\n\nAccording to the survey, fund managers believe long positions (those anticipating a rise) are the most crowded in the US dollar and tech stocks, while short (anticipating a fall) in oil and emerging markets.\n\nThe biggest swing between January and February was in the emergence of long positions in FANG stocks, Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly Google) after these stocks endured a savage sell-off last month as investors fretted about their extreme valuations.\n\nOn the other side of the trade, short positions in oil have emerged as one of the most crowded trades with the oil price teetered below $US30 a barrel.

This particular patient of Dr Ren\u00e9 was over weight and the doctor wasn't quite comfortable to lay himself on her body. He then devised a paper stethoscope - he rolled a paper and then placed it on her chest - and that was what led to the device.\n\nThe doctor was impressed by the results the little rolled paper was able to produce and went ahead to improvise. He later built one that had a microphone at one end and an ear piece on the other side.\n\nThe name is also derived from greek words, where stethos means chest and scopos means examination.\n\nThough there are electronic stethoscopes in today's age, the idea of asking your doctor if you can put the device on his chest and plug in the ear phones is still a fascinating one.

For many people, this site has been quite useful, with tens of thousands of active users. However, we have never announced this service publicly, until now. We finally feel that the code is mature enough that we want to climb every mountain top and scream at the top of our collective lungs \"Crabgrass is here!\" Or maybe we should just tell all our Riseup users about it in a newsletter? Yeah, probably that last one.\n\nWhat is Crabgrass?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a nutshell, Crabgrass is a simple way for groups to edit shared wiki pages. Crabgrass, however, has a few features that make it unique in the world of collaborative web applications. In particular, Crabgrass is designed to allow people to privately collaborate within a group and with other groups. Uniquely, Crabgrass allows for powerful searches, including full text searching, across the entire universe of things you have access to.\n\nAt Riseup, we believe that all technology encodes systems of power. In the long run, the only way for us to use technology for good is to create or deploy technology that reflects the way we want to connect with each other, and not the way that the surveillance economy wants us to. Crabgrass was designed by and for people practicing bottom-up, democratic organizing.\n\nCrabgrass has been our collective's communication tool for internal organizing for the last eight years. We use it for everything: we have many internal committees set up, we document all our minutes and research, we upload files and images, we use it for group discussions for big issues we need to mull over, and we use polls and voting in order to find consensus and make decisions. There is no way our distracted brains would be able to keep track of everything otherwise. Riseup would not exist without it!\n\nWhy Pigeon thinks you all should use Crabgrass\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collective member who primarily writes these newsletters, Feral Rock Pigeon, has this to say about Crabgrass: \"I am the least technical of all the Riseup members, and I find myself constantly muddling through this technological world. I am required to use the Google stuff (drive, docs, etc.) for some non-Riseup work, and I am always lost navigating through the fog. Ugh.

That's exactly what it is meant for--self organization of social movements. Crabgrass is driven by people who care about it becoming a better tool for themselves, their groups and everyone.\n\nMaybe you've chopped vegetables or washed teargas from peoples eyes at a protest. Maybe you've helped setup a barricade or tidied up the space it was meant to protect. Let's apply the same spirit of self-directed mutual help to the improvement of this collective space.

AMAZING. If you are a developer, it's a great time to get involved.\n\nSome warnings\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe recognize that Crabgrass has some bugs, and we are actively working to fix those. We are excited about this new release, but recognize that it is not perfect, and we will continue to iron out problems, as well as adding new functionality. We know that many people want calendaring functionality, and etherpad/ethercalc integration.\n\nAlso, please realize that putting something in Crabgrass does not inherently mean it is secure. If somebody with access to a page makes it public, then that page is public to any human or robot on the internet. So, as with any communication tool, it is important that you talk about your security protocols, and have some understanding of how the tool works. Understand who has access to a page, and that those with certain access can share the information (inadvertently or not) with others, by directly sharing the page, inviting others to the group, or having their account compromised.\n\nCrabgrass does not feature end-to-end encryption: like with email, the Riseup collective has access to all the information on Crabgrass. There is currently no good way to support client-side encryption for a web application in a manner that prevents the provider from gaining access to the data. Nevertheless, we do plan to support some limited forms of client-side encryption in the future.\n\nKeep it alive!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have devoted thousands of hours to developing Crabgrass and maintaining the service.

They are all considered tattoos that \"basic\" girls get. Why do these objects have to be considered basic?\n\nI think that every tattoo that you get should have a meaning since it will be embedded on your skin for the rest of your life. That is the reason why I think that these objects aren't basic. They are symbols of memories that people have in their lives.\n\nOne of the problems of labeling these different objects is that many people are skeptical about getting them. Most girls don't want to be considered \"basic\". It is not a compliment to many people and some people believe that these objects are simply symbols of basicness.\n\nI have definitely thought about what people might think if I was to get the particular tattoo that I want, a compass with an arrow going through the middle as one of the needles. This is not what everybody would consider basic but it has \"basic\" elements. The arrow, for example, is something that people see as basic, but nobody really knows the deeper meaning behind it. An arrow can only be shot by pulling it backward, so to me this means that when life is pulling you back with difficulties, it will launch you into something great.\n\nEverybody has a different reason for getting tattoos and they all have their own meanings for them. Also, every tattoo is different so they are never \"basic.\"\n\nTattoos aren't the only thing that are associated with the word \"basic.\" There are actions that girls do that are considered basic. A girl could just be going in and getting her favorite drink from Starbucks and decides to take a picture of it. Guess what people call her? Basic.\n\nAnother thing, why should people actually care if they are called basic? Being basic isn't necessarily a bad thing. Why can't being basic be considered taking a screenshot of the small moments in our lives that symbolize something bigger? Why can't basic just mean things that you like to do or things that you just like in general? Why label things as basic? Why label at all?\n\nSocial media has a lot to do with all of this. Many people post photos on Instagram and Facebook and people will comment saying, \"that's so basic\" or something similar to that. What is even worse than this is when people include in their own caption \"#Basicwhitegirl.\" This brings more attention and meaning to the label.\n\nHave you ever looked up the word basic before? I decided to actually look up on Google \"What do basic girls do?\" A lot of the articles that came up were about what \"basic white girls do.\" Urban Dictionary came up with having different objects and actions that people do every day. There are common and random things like Starbucks, Uggs and selfies, yet if you see a girl doing them they can be called basic. And yes, I said girl, because if you really think about it, guys don't really get called basic. The \"basic\" label is sexist and the label itself should just be removed from society.", "The resolute position of Apple's chief executive Tim Cook to defend the security of iOS encryption has drawn sharp contrast with a deafening silence from Google, Microsoft and their hardware partners in Korea and China, where individuals' security and privacy is commonly overlooked as being a critical feature.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook\n\nApple standing alone for encryption and user privacy\n\nCook published a public letter stating that \"we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help\" the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations to recover data from an iPhone left behind by a terrorist involved in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\nHowever, he opposed an order from a Federal court that \"demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.\"\n\nThat order requests that Apple develop a new version of iOS capable of allowing law enforcement to bypass key security settings in order to rapidly \"brute force\" a series of password guesses to unlock its encryption. Among other things, this would erase the time delays between false password attempts and allow for automated, electronic submission of a string of potential passwords rather than requiring that each be keyed in manually by a real person.\n\n\"Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\" Cook stated, adding, \"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true.\"\n\nCook stated that \"in the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\"\n\n\"Apple employees should feel incredibly proud today\"\n\nEarlier today, WhiteHat Security founder Jeremiah Grossman tweeted, \"if Apple 'technically' could comply, yet they still resist, it says even more good things about the Tim Cook and company character,\" adding, \"Apple employees should feel incredibly proud today.\"\n\n\"Apple is nearly unique of tech firms in it's high profile, has revenue that don't rely on compromising privacy... \" https://t.co/F7IIlb4shL -- Jeremiah Grossman (@jeremiahg)\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\n\n\"How do Apple shareholders feel today? Does their fierce protection of customer security & privacy drive extra iPhone sales? I hope so,\" he added, followed by, \"And don't GOV officials also use iPhones themselves? Did they think through that they'd also undermine the security of their own devices?\"\n\nHe also drew a contrast between Apple's high profile pushback to maintain the security of its encryption with other companies. \"Today would be the perfect day for Sundar Pichai (Google, CEO) to back up Tim Cook (Apple, CEO),\" he noted.\n\nGoogle says nothing\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the issue in a USA Today article written by Jessica Guynn, which cited Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden as stating, \"The FBI is creating a world where citizens rely on Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around.\"\"Silence means Google picked a side, but it's not the public's\" - Edward Snowden\n\nSnowden called the issue \"the most important tech case in a decade,\" and specifically pointed out that, \"Silence means Google picked a side, but it's not the public's.\"\n\nGuynn also cited WhatsApp founder and Facebook board member Jan Koum, who posted on Facebook: \"I have always admired Tim Cook for his stance on privacy and Apple's efforts to protect user data and couldn't agree more with everything said in their Customer Letter today. We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\"\n\nSecurity is a key issue for Apple\n\nWhile Google's chairman Eric Schmidt boasted to the media in 2014 that \"our systems are far more secure and encrypted than anyone else, including Apple,\" groups that take privacy and security seriously, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have recommended Apple's messaging products for their end-to-end encryption while cautioning that Google did not provide similar security for its users.\n\nLast November, Chris Soghioan, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, went even further to state that Apple's efforts to protect the privacy of its users, including end-to-end encryption of their communications, effectively separated its more affluent iOS users from the poor and disadvantaged forced to use Android.\n\n\"The security people I know at Google are embarrassed by Android,\" Soghioan noted.\n\nFinSpy Mobile couldn't attack iOS without a jailbreak\n\nBoth Android devices and Windows PCs have a wide variety of over the counter spyware tools and privacy exploits that are easy for even amateurs to find, while even tools sold to law enforcement (including FinSpy, above, from global surveillance firm Gamma Group) note that they won't work on iPhones and other iOS devices unless their security has been jailbroken by the user.\n\nWithout any commercial interest in collecting user data for marketing purposes, Apple is in a unique position to defend user privacy and security. While both Google and Microsoft have made headlines for their lax efforts to protect user data on their Android and Windows platforms, their licensees have gone even further. Last year, China's Lenovo -- the largest producer of both Windows PCs and Android smartphones -- bundled Superfish adware on some of its products using a self-signed root certificate, without considering that this practice opened up its users to having their encrypted communications being intercepted.\n\nSecurity firm Bluebox Labs found that virtually all of the discount Android tablets sold by from major retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Kmart, Kohl's, Staples, Target and Walmart similarly shipped with \"shocking\" security flaws, malware and even active backdoors installed to spy on users.\n\nFBI's request will likely be replicated by Communist, Islamic states\n\nApple now sells most of its products outside the U.S. That means if it were to allow the FBI to demand a security bypass that effectively destroyed iOS security, it would also face similar pressures in the U.K., Saudi Arabia, and of course the People's Republic of China, now Apple's largest sales territory. The company is also working to establish a sales presence in Iran.\n\nThe New York Times: @FBI's war on #Apple will aid China. https://t.co/URWamc702q pic.twitter.com/KnHDsWIENY -- Edward Snowden (@Snowden)\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\n\nIf the U.S. can demand that Apple tear down its entire security system to facilitate an investigation to see whether a single phone might have some potentially useful data on it, it won't be long before every country on earth demands access to this same software tool in order to hunt down their own enemies, many of whom might be Americans, or even members of the FBI or NSA.\n\nThose are all issues Apple considers, because unlike Google, it earns significant profits in China and has a long term strategy that doesn't get rebooted every year after failing to make any progress.\n\nU.S. Government and data security\n\nWhile the FBI continues to insist that Apple could write a security-free version of iOS for use in investigating just the one phone involved in this case, somehow without spreading to malicious actors or repressive foreign governments that may use this tool against the U.S. itself, the government's track record in securing or even caring about citizens' privacy, making reasonable use of user data, and safeguarding the private data of individuals it collects -- and even of its own FBI employees -- is atrociously incompetent.\n\nJust last summer, the U.S. government suffered a \"colossal breach of government computer systems\" that exposed sensitive information, including the fingerprints, health and financial history of 19.7 million people who had subjected themselves to government background checks. That came just weeks after data on 4.2 million federal employees had earlier been compromised, as noted by a report in the New York Times.\n\n\"Both attacks are believed to have originated in China,\" the report stated, citing senior administration officials.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress have so little confidence in their own government's ability to hold detainees under arrest that they signed a law preventing the Obama Administration from transferring \"Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States for any reason, including prosecution.\"\n\nIf the government can't be trusted to lock up individuals on U.S. soil in maximum security prisons, how can it expect to guarantee that it can somehow safeguard a far more commercially valuable software mechanism capable of exploiting encrypted data stored on the only secure mobile platform left?", "George Soros, billionaire investor, philanthropist, and author, is the chairman of Soros Fund Management LLC. The $6.05 billion fund generated gains of 12.22% in the last quarter, and primarily invests in technology stocks. Let's take a look at some of Soros' activity in the fourth quarter, including transactions on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Soros increased his holdings in Amazon by over 36%, now making up 1.19% of his total holdings. It was nothing but good news for Amazon in the fourth quarter. Most notably, the company posted stellar Q3 earnings, posting above consensus EPS and revenue as well as guiding 25% y/y growth. In the report, its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services, accounted for 52% of operating profit, as much as its North American segment, while representing just 8% of the company's total sales. The company is the leader of cloud computing, as it has 10 times the amount of infrastructure cloud capacity relative to its peers.\n\nThe holiday shopping season was also a success for the company as they posted record sales with a 40% y/y increase in items shipped and record sales of its own devices such as the Kindle Fire. The company also added 3 million prime subscribers during this season. Other quarter events include an expanded Prime product selection, including the addition of channels for its video streaming service, as well as the launch of its food delivery service and first brick and mortar store. At the end of the quarter, the stock was trading at historic highs of about $694 per share.\n\nAnalysts and Soros agree on this e-commerce giant, as 32 out of 36 analysts who have rated the company on TipRanks in the past 3 months gave a Buy rating.\n\nFacebook Inc\n\nSoros reduced his stake in Facebook by over 54%, now accounting for 1.41% of his total holdings. In the fourth quarter, Facebook posted above consensus revenue and EPS in its Q3 earnings release, highlighting a 14% y/y increase in monthly active users, while adding 60 million users during the third quarter alone. Advertising revenue climbed 45% y/y and its subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, also reported impressive growth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company launched its local business review site, which directly competes with Yelp. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife announced they would donate 99% of their shares to charity over his lifetime, a contribution worth $45 billion, to charity to commemorate the birth of their daughter in the fourth quarter.\n\nInterestingly, Soros and analysts strongly disagree on the social media leader, as only 1 out of 32 analysts gave a Sell rating in the last 3 months on TipRanks. While 3 remain neutral, 28 gave a Buy rating.\n\nAlphabet Inc\n\nSoros added Alphabet, Google's new parents company, to his portfolio in the fourth quarter, purchasing over 65,000 shares with his stake valued at $51 million, comprising 0.84% of his total holdings. In the beginning of the fourth quarter, Google reorganized itself and created a parent company Alphabet, which is comprised of Google, its subsidiaries such as YouTube, and various other segments.\n\nIn its Q3 earnings release, the last of Google's before the reorganization, the company beat both revenue and EPS estimates and bought back $5 billion worth of stock. The earnings highlighted a 23% y/y growth in paid clicks, which also topped estimates. Another highlight was the rise in mobile, as mobile search topped desktop search for the first time and contributed significantly to revenue.\n\nEvents for the fourth quarter include the launch of its OnHub wireless router, rebranding its life sciences segment as Verily, a rumored partnership announcement with Ford to build driverless cars, and a project in Indonesia involving wind-propelled balloons to bring internet to large partitions of the country.\n\nLike Soros, analyst consensus is a Buy on Alphabet, as 34 out of 35 who have rated the company in the past 3 months on TipRanks gave a bullish rating, while only 1 remains neutral.", "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) might have the early upper hand in its fight against the FBI.\n\nCEO Tim Cook in a letter to customers on Tuesday night said his company has used an encryption to protect its customers' personal data, as that's the only way Apple believes that personal information can be safe.\n\n\"[T]he FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\"\n\nThe court order Cook referred to came from a California judge, who on Tuesday ordered Apple to help the FBI unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December. In a court filing, prosecutors said Apple had the means to bypass the security features on the phone, but that the company had \"declined to provide that assistance voluntarily.\"\n\nSee Also: Tim Cook: FBI Is Asking Apple For Something Too Dangerous To Create\n\nBenzinga polled its followers with the following question: Who do you side with regarding Tim Cook's \"dangerous precedent\" letter?\n\nTwo-thirds (66 percent) said they side with the tech giant. \"We cannot trade profit for national security.My children value more their personal security than their inheritance,\" @drminh responded.\n\nJeremiah Grossman, founder of WhiteHat Security, Tweeted that \"Today would be the perfect day for Sundar Pichai (Google, CEO) to back up Tim Cook.\" Famous NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden backed this claim up: \"This is the most important tech case in a decade. Silence means @google picked a side, but it's not the public's.\"\n\n\"The @FBI is creating a world where citizens rely on #Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around,\" Snowden said.\n\nIn a detailed analysis, TechCrunch concluded, \"So with the volume of sensitive data being pulled online continuing to increase, unimpeachable security is more -- not less -- important. Making Apple's public defense of the security of its users the only viable position to take here. Because how will any technology company be able to offer trusted services to consumers if government-mandated backdoors are being forced upon them?\"", "BEIJING: Apple Inc launched its mobile payment system in China on Thursday in a bid to convince the hundreds of millions of users of the country's entrenched, dominant services to switch.\n\n\"We think China could be our largest Apple Pay market,\" Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing.\n\nIn an early boost, China's biggest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), was among the banks that said earlier this week that customers would be able to use Apple Pay from Thursday.\n\nHowever, Apple Pay has not had an easy ride so far in China, the fifth country to get the service.

Don't you feel like that? Like there were these crazy and smart college friends that you loved, Abbi and Ilana, and you haven't seen them in ages, and then, surprise, here they are! Phil, it is such a crazy pleasure to see them again. And yet -- how shall I say this? -- sometimes when you see crazy smart old friends there's a little bit of disconcerting adjustment. Watching last night's opener I was loving the crazy, and also felt like I was saying to myself: hmm, where's the smart? I'm sure it must be here somewhere!\n\nAnother way of saying this, Phil, is that watching our Broads, I felt a lot of enthusiasm and also some disenchantment. Maybe that was just me.\n\nPHIL: It's not just you. I loved this episode. These two are such specific, weird, and wonderfully precise physical comedians, and this episode was a real showcase. Slapstick is a big part of this show, but millennial self-parody has always been a part of the show too. I never tire of seeing Abbi and Ilana dance/fall-down, but having Ilana rant about Saudi women while bemoaning the loss of bottomless mimosas at the top felt familiar. So I hear what you're saying about the show's intelligence, but, counterintuitively, I think the smartest bits are often the dumbest ones. In other words, I think the show is often least satisfying when it's reaching to say something and most satisfying when it just lets us spin around in its chaotic, Richard Scarry vision of contemporary New York.\n\nSARAH: Last year, you and I and the rest of Dear TV wrote about Broad City, and I never felt at a loss for something to say. The humor always felt raunchy, but also rigorous: smart, editorial, deeply layered. Broad City always felt like a text, like something excited to be closely read. And this time -- I don't know. Yes, it's awesome that women are making bathroom jokes; yes, we love their boundary redefining friendship. Totally on board. But I wasn't sure there was anything new they were saying about either of those things.\n\nPHIL: Layered is the right word, I think. And I think the parts in this episode that worked best were the ones that really exploited those layers. The opening sequence, the search for a bathroom as Descent into Hell. Even at its most uneven, there's always a lot to notice on Broad City.\n\nSARAH: Let's consider the opening sequence, which was probably my favorite part of the episode and -- let me tell you -- really rewards repeat viewing. It's a montage journey through Abbi and Ilana's year since we've last seen them: images of them celebrating New Year's Eve, enduring frozen winter nights, getting ready for parties, smoking up, going on dates; they read Hillary Clinton's memoir, they argue about whether the dress is white or blue. But in a classic Broad City move, we're shown this \"year in a glance\" in split screen, giving us glimpses into... Abbi and Ilana's bathrooms.\n\nAnd obviously it's totally genius: never was there more a site of self-making and unmaking than the Broad City shitter. Not to get all literary here, but there's a great history of textual bathrooms (Streetcar Named Desire, Jasmine), of the dirty places you go to get clean, and bathrooms work even better for Abbi and Ilana because these characters are so completely willing to mix output (shit, pee, vomit, dead goldfish) with input (smoke, food, dick). In perhaps my favorite moment from the sequence, Abbi joyfully kisses a (presumably negative) pregnancy test, before realizing that even though the negative test is the blissful sign that she will not be \"outputing\" a baby, it is nevertheless a site of her pee, which she has just, through kissing, more or less taken in.\n\nSo I mean: that is clearly great, even though I do think we should really be careful about what makes these characters able to dabble so blissfully in their own abjection (this is the part where I point everyone towards Kyla Wazana Tompkins and Rebecca Wanzo's incredible discussion Brown Broads, White TV: go read that and then come back). But I'm not sure what the rest of the episode did for me. Chainz? Art?\n\nPHIL: One of the reasons I feel vaguely uncomfortable imagining that I'm friends with these women is that Broad City is so very much a show about millennials. I know that it invites viewer friendship -- the same way that its wealthy aunt Sex and the City did -- but sometimes accepting that invitation feels like generational tourism. It walks a strange line between celebration and self-parody that always makes me worry that I'm accessing the show the wrong way, that I'm invested because of the kind of grumpy release-valve it gives me rather than through true friendship.\n\nBut regardless of whether or not it's creepy that we're here, this sequence is such a great example of the way the show, at its best, doesn't belittle or lionize this generation so much as produce a revealing grotesque of it. The split screen -- which they use a lot -- does so much work. If you know anything about Broad City, you know that it's about female friendship. But, it's a sticky, dirty depiction. From their pepper-sprayed eyes in the first season to the bloodied boobs that end this episode, this is a friendship rooted in unpleasant, yet cathartic, contact.\n\nSo, this is a show about friendship and closeness, but much of it happens at a distance. Abbi and Ilana are so often apart, for all that we think of them as inseparably together. The split screen jokes that mirror their independent lives, that show them doing the same things in tandem, that show them somehow sharing pizza and chocolates, that show them on the phone -- this is maybe the best Skype show of all time -- these all add up to a kind of massive, choreographed eye-roll about the idea that Facebook Is Making Us Lonely, Google Is Making Us Stupid, Snapchat Is Making Us Smelly, Social Media, in general, is Tearing Us Apart. Not Abbi and Ilana! When this show is moving -- and it's sometimes moving -- it's moving because of the depth, or layering, of this friendship that might otherwise appear to be shallow.\n\nThis show isn't curated, it's accumulated, which made the jabs about art-world pretension in this episode seem not only tired but out of place.\n\nSARAH: Yeah, I guess the whole chainz and art left me more or less cold (do we need to be making fun of young urban millennials and their testical art? I mean, maybe, but not necessarily?). But I did -- only after a second viewing, let me be honest -- love the way the show circled back to the input-output shenanigans of the opening sequence. Ilana, having spent the whole episode with her cartoonishly-large bike chain locked around her waist, sits on her bed braced for Abbi to force her free from her chains. For Ilana, this experience -- involving, as it does, lube, thrusting, positioning, and trying to fit something large (Ilana) through something small (the circle of Ilana's chain) -- feels, as she says, \"sexual.\" And it is, of course! (The fact that Abbi's dressed like she's about to clean the house doesn't change that: nothing turns Abbi on like the chance to beyond some bed and bath.)\n\nWhat's most wonderful about the scene is how it collapses the typical binaries that organize sex. There's a hole and a phallus, and a lot of sexual resonances, but there's not a clear assignment of agency around those objects; Ilana's body seems like both the phallus and the thing that's getting fucked. And even more impressively: is Ilana getting off by going in our coming out? In a complete collapse of the input-output tensions of the beginning, the scene seems like simultaneous intercourse and birth; Ilana has fucked herself with her own hole and given birth to her own body. \"It's coming, it's coming!\" shouts Abbi, as she pulls the chain free and Ilana screams. That is some jouissance right there, Phil! I was like: check it, Ilana is crowning.\n\nSo maybe I've talked myself into liking this episode, afterall?\n\nPHIL: I have no way of following that, Sarah, except to briefly return to Hillary Rodham Clinton. Why is Ilana saluting Living History on the toilet? If these are millennial women, shouldn't they be Feeling the Bern? Haven't I read 30 posts in the past two weeks pondering why the female, twentysomething precariat is denying Hillary? Maybe this is another one of those moments when the show wants us to see Ilana missing the point, or maybe it's not. (There are rumors that the former senator from New York will be making an appearance on the show this season.) For some reason, it feels like that book fits in this episode, which we're reacting to with (in your words) equal parts enthusiasm and disenchantment. We are proud of and disappointed in Ilana Wexler, and she will rise from the ashes of 2016's Hillary Clinton.\n\nSARAH: Oh man. Phil, that is super intense. I'm not sure I'm prepared to talk about Bernie, Hillary, our global future, and our newly-found shared responsibility to PROTECT SCOTUS AT WHATEVER THE COST. So can I instead mention something that is, I think... lighter?", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone. Apple says that would mean writing a whole new operating system that would then be in danger of being tweaked to crack into other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.)\n\nApple's position is really unique for this fight. On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself. Though he also doesn't discount the possibility that the National Security Agency probably could crack into the iPhone, too, but that's not what this case is about.\n\n(As a note, there's a lot we don't know about how exactly security technology works inside the iPhones, especially when comparing new ones to older ones like the 5c in this case. So experts disagree about the government's true technical capacity.)\n\n\"This is in many ways more about legal strategy than what's actually on the phone,\" Soghoian says.\n\nAnd that's a sentiment shared across the industry.\n\n\"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake,\" Jan Koum, CEO of encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, has written in a Facebook post. (Facebook owns WhatsApp.)\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, too, posted on Twitter that he was aware of the challenges that law enforcement agencies face in protecting the public and companies cooperate based on valid legal orders, but \"that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nMicrosoft's executives haven't issued statements of their own, but shared a comment posted by the Reform Government Surveillance coalition (AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo):\n\n\"Reform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information.\"\n\n\"The real linchpin here is not the details of differences between iOS and Android, but they're being forced to produce a new version of software,\" says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nIn that sense, the case is being watched by any company whose customers' data privacy depends on their security software updates, which is a unique universe of encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal but also software makers like Apple and Google.\n\n\"Everyone is carefully watching this because if the government gets what they want here, they'll have the power to conscript tech companies to covertly deliver surveillance software,\" Soghoian says.", "Alexander Silva is thinking less and less about his bank these days. He uses his Venmo app at least three times a month to pay his rent or reimburse a friend who picks up the check at dinner. \"I'll just Venmo them right then,\" says the 25-year-old San Francisco photographer. He's also been using Apple Pay in emergencies -- like the time he paid for gas when he forgot his wallet on a road trip. \"I think of it as I am using Apple Pay\" rather than Bank of America, says Silva, who's linked his account at the lender with Apple Pay.\n\nThat attitude concerns financial institutions, which believe mobile payment services such as Venmo and Apple Pay could erode loyalty, particularly among millennials, who surveys show are more prone to switching banks than their elders. \"The biggest risk for them is their relationship with their customer,\" says Zilvinas Bareisis, a senior analyst at Celent, a consulting firm. Surprisingly, most banks aren't putting up much of a fight. Only 5 percent of U.S. banks Celent polled in November had a branded wallet app that works in stores for Android phones, and just 17 percent planned to release one in the coming 6 to 12 months. (Most third-party in-store wallets are incompatible with iPhones.)\n\nMany institutions seem prepared to cede the field to Google, Apple, and Samsung, all of which have a head start. Apple Pay, introduced in 2014, appears to be getting the most traction in the U.S., where some 12 million people use it at least once a month, a number that should more than double, to 25 million, by yearend, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.\n\nApple Pay isn't the first digital payment technology to pose a challenge for the banking industry -- pioneer PayPal has been around since 1998. But the stakes are much bigger now that Walmart stores, Starbucks cafes, and Chevron gas stations are among those retooling to handle payments through digital wallets. Researcher EMarketer estimates the value of transactions made by tapping or waving a phone at the point of sale will reach $210 billion by 2019, up from $8.7 billion last year.\n\n\"We see a day when customers are leaving their home without their card,\" says Jonathan Velline, head of ATM and store strategy at Wells Fargo. Already, 82 percent of banks are concerned about ensuring that theirs becomes or stays the most-used card in the digital wallet, while 61 percent worry that Apple and other tech giants may encroach deeper into their territory, according to the Celent survey. Maureen Burns, a partner in Bain's financial-services practice, says \"the worst-case scenario\" for banks is that they're reduced to playing the role of a utility, in which \"they have the risk and regulatory burden but don't get to participate in the best parts of the profit pool.\"\n\nApple has never disclosed the fees it charges banks to process Apple Pay transactions, but analysts figure it collects half a cent on in-store debit card purchases and 15 basis points on credit cards in the U.S. The service generated just $15 million in gross revenue for Apple in the first year of operation, according to Richard Crone, chief executive officer of Crone Consulting, a firm that specializes in mobile payments. Crone figures that could top $1 billion annually in five years if ad revenue is factored in.\n\nIn October, Capital One became the first U.S. institution to introduce its own wallet app that works in stores. \"The irony is, when we first launched payments, people began to ask us, 'Why would we use a bank for payments vs. digital company XYZ?'\u2009\" says Tom Poole, managing vice president for digital payments. He says the wallet has been \"a success\" but won't say how many customers are using it. \"Banks were asleep at the wheel and didn't offer customers alternatives,\" he adds. JPMorgan Chase will unveil its own mobile wallet in mid-2016. As the largest retail bank in the U.S., it could rack up as many users in the first year as Apple Pay did in two, Crone says.\n\nSome banks are lining up behind a product completely different from a wallet. On Feb. 4, Visa announced software being tested by undisclosed clients that feeds card data to all apps on a consumer's device and directs consumers to the issuer bank in case of a problem. \"This puts the banks more firmly into their roles as the trusted third party in payments,\" says Jim McCarthy, an executive vice president at Visa. \"People won't think about whether it's Apple or Samsung or Google. Over time it will become the card again.\"\n\nThat may be wishful thinking. \"Being able to provide a fully branded experience in the digital world will probably be unrealistic,\" says Celent's Bareisis. \"The world will be more fragmented.\" Wells Fargo is embracing that notion: Beginning in the second quarter, account holders will be able to use Android Pay, as well as plastic, to withdraw money at thousands of its ATMs. \"The convenience means that customers are going to get value out of the fact that they have a card with Wells Fargo,\" says Brett Pitts, head of digital at the bank.\n\nThe bottom line: Banks are playing catch-up to Apple Pay's digital wallet, which could have 25 million active users in the U.S. by yearend.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "Verizon Communications once aspired to be the Comcast of mobile, streaming movies and TV shows to its 107 million monthly subscribers. Now it wants to be YouTube, feeding short video clips to millennials, who spend more hours each day glued to the tiny screens of their phones than they spend sitting in front of a TV.\n\nAmerica's largest mobile carrier has reached a key juncture. Its wireless revenue tripled in the past decade, but growth has slowed as just about everyone in the U.S. now has a cell phone. That's why Verizon is eager to stake its claim in the nascent market for mobile video. More than 139 million Americans watched video on a smartphone at least once a month in 2015, a number that's expected to jump 22 percent, to 169 million, by 2018, according to estimates by researcher EMarketer.\n\nVerizon's Go90, named after people's tendency to flip their phone sideways to watch movies and videos, premiered as an app for Apple and Android phones in October and is available to customers of other carriers. The service is aimed mainly at teens and twentysomethings, for whom video watching is a social experience. There's a \"cut and share\" feature that lets users share clips with their Facebook friends and Twitter followers.\n\nGo90's lineup includes shows from ESPN, NFL Network, MTV, VH1, and the Food Network. To supplement that, the carrier has commissioned more than 50 exclusive series from CollegeHumor, Vice, and Endemol Beyond USA, among others. Live broadcasts of sporting events such as NBA games (subject to additional fees) and concerts are also part of the mix. \"If you look at mobile handset penetration, increased data speeds, and the viability of video offerings on mobile, it's just getting better with time,\" says Tom Gorke, executive vice president for sales and content distribution at Viacom, which owns Comedy Central and several of the other networks supplying Go90. \"Verizon is the largest mobile operator in the country. Everyone would be eager to do a deal with someone that large.\"\n\nIn a move that may tip the playing field, Verizon announced in early February that data usage on Go90 won't count toward customers' caps. Rivals such as Netflix and YouTube Red, a $9.99-a-month subscription service introduced in October, would have to pay the carrier for their offerings to enjoy the same treatment. Executives at Verizon didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe company's initial goal was to deliver subscribers a full package of live TV, on-demand shows, pay-per-view events, and games. It shifted gears last summer after it became clear that negotiating streaming rights with broadcasters and media companies would be difficult and time-consuming. Apple and AT&T have postponed their own video streaming services for similar reasons.\n\nUnlike YouTube Red and Netflix, Go90 is free. Verizon is counting on ads to pay for the service. In the U.S., mobile video ad spending is growing faster than any other type of digital advertising: EMarketer estimates it reached $2.8 billion in 2015 and will double, to almost $6 billion, by 2018. Growth would be even stronger, EMarketer said in a report in June, if there were more consensus between ad buyers and sellers on audience metrics and pricing.\n\nUsing the trove of information it has collected on its wireless subscribers, including age, gender, general interests, and location, Verizon says it can help marketers flash their ads to the right people at the right time. With its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL in May, the carrier acquired a well-established programmatic ad platform -- where machines, not people, make decisions about which ads run where. \"AOL gives Go90 real-time ad sales,\" says Roger Entner, an analyst with wireless industry strategist Recon Analytics. \"Without that, Verizon would have to rely on someone else like Google to provide the ad platform.\"\n\nDuring an earnings calls in January, Verizon's chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said the service had surpassed expectations. He declined to give specifics other than that the app had been downloaded some 2 million times. He tamped down expectations of a quick return. \"Go90 will not be a profitable product probably within a one-year to two-year horizon,\" he said.\n\nWalt Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG, an institutional brokerage, thinks Go90 may be even more of a long shot. \"Sure, you can have fewer, higher-quality ads that companies are willing to pay more for, but you are going to need a lot of customers like that to even begin to move the needle for a company of Verizon's size,\" he says.\n\nThe bottom line: With Go90, Verizon is looking to capture a share of mobile ad spending, which is forecast to double by 2018, to almost $6 billion.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "Bloomberg TVAswath Damodaran\n\nApple and Alphabet, the two companies jockeying for the prize of \"largest market cap company in the world\" are both incredibly successful businesses, with unparalleled cash machines (the iPhone and Google Search) at their core.\n\nThat said, the last month has been eventful for both companies, just as it has for the rest of the market, as their latest earnings reports seem to suggest that these firms are on divergent paths.\n\nHaving valued Apple multiple times on this blog over the last five years, and bought and sold the stock based on those valuations, the most recent earnings report is an opportune time for me to revisit Apple's value. Having never valued Alphabet on this blog, though I have valued it in my classes multiple times, its earnings report is a good time to initiate the process with a valuation.\n\nThe Apple Rollercoaster\n\nApple's most recent earnings report came out on January 26, 2016, and it contained mixed news. On the good news front, Apple announced the largest quarterly earnings in corporate history and higher earnings per share than expected by analysts. The bad news was that these earnings were generated on revenues that were close to flat for the year, that iPhone sales were lower than expected and that the management expected revenues to stay weak through next quarter (in its guidance). The market's reaction was negative, with Apple's stock declining by 6.57%, a drop in market capitalization of more than $30 billion, right after the announcement.\n\nIn the picture below, I capture the pricing reaction to Apple, with its earnings history as background information:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nIn summary, it looks like the market is weighing the iPhone and guidance bad news far more than the earnings good news in making its assessment, with Apple's history of beating earnings every quarter for the last eight weighing against it.\n\nTo evaluate whether the earnings report merited the negative market reaction, I went back to the intrinsic value drawing board and updated my valuation of Apple, the last of which I posted in August 2015 and subsequently updated in November 2015, after its annual report (with a September 2015 year end) came out. My assessment of Apple's value in November of 2015 was $134/share, but more importantly, the narrative that I had for Apple was that of a slow-growth , cash rich company (revenue growth rate of 3% in the next five years and a cash balance of $200 billion), with operating margins under pressure (declining from the 32.03% it earned as a pre-tax operating margin in the 2015 fiscal year to 25% over the next decade) and a very low probability of a difference-making disruption.\n\nLooking at the earnings report, it is true that revenue growth came in below expectations (but not by much, given my low expectations) and operating margins dropped, again in line with expectations.\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nThe net effect is that my narrative changed little, and using a slightly lower revenue growth rate (2.2% instead of 3%) leads me to an updated assessment of value per share of $126 in February 2016 and almost all of the difference is coming from a repricing of risk (higher equity risk premiums and default spreads in the market).\n\nIn keeping with my view that estimated value is a distribution, not a single number, I ran a simulation on Apple's value in February 2016:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nAt the price of $94 at close of trading on February 12, 2016, Apple looks under valued by about 25% and at least based on my distribution, there is a more than 90% chance that it is under valued.\n\nAlphabet Soup\n\nAlphabet surprised markets on February 1, 2016, with on earnings report where the company reported higher revenue growth than anticipated, coupled with higher profit margins. Since it was also the first report that the company was releasing as holding company, where it was breaking itself down by business, there was also excitement about what you would learn about the company from this report.\n\nAs with Apple, I start by looking at the pricing effect of the earnings report, comparing, actual numbers to expectations and tallying the stock price reaction to the report:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nMarkets were impressed by both the revenue and earnings numbers and the stock price increased by 8% in the immediate aftermath, briefly leading Alphabet to the front of the market cap race.\n\nAs a counter to the market's excitement, I decided to compare the narrative (and value) that I had for Alphabet in November 2015 (after their last earnings report) to the narrative (and value) after this one (in February 2016). In November 2015, my narrative for Google was that it would continue to be a dominant and profitable player in a growing online advertising market, growing 12% a year in the near term, maintaining its operating margins (left at 30% in pre-tax terms, in perpetuity).\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nIt is true that in their most recent earnings report, Alphabet reported double-digit growth in revenues (impressive given their size and the state of the global economy) and higher operating margins than they did in the previous quarter. I left my original narrative largely intact, with revenue growth remaining at 12% and pushed up the target pre-tax operating margin to 32%, and arrived at a value per share of $631/share.Presenting Google's value as a distribution, here is what I get:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nAt $682.40, the price at which the class C shares were trading at on February 12, 2016, the stock is trading at about 8% above the median price, with a 35% chance of being under valued. Since these shares have no voting rights, attaching a value to voting rights, will make the shares a little more over priced.\n\nI know that one reason for Google's restructuring/renaming exercise last year was an ostensible desire to improve transparency, but I think that there may be less here than promised, at least at the moment. There were a few things that became transparent in Google's last earnings release, as captured in this picture of a key part of the earnings release from the company:\n\nAswath Damodaran\n\nTransparency is good for investors, but with Alphabet, I will reserve my cheers until I see real evidence of it (and perhaps I will, in the full 10Q).\n\nApple vs Alphabet\n\nIf this were a boxing match, Apple and Alphabet would be the super heavyweights, fighting it out for the world championship. To judge which is the better company, though, you would have to specify on what dimension you are making the comparison, i.e., as a business, an investment or as a trade.\n\nI. As Businesses\n\nApple and Alphabet share a few common features. First, each of them derives their value from one cash cow, the iPhone for Apple and the search engine for Google, that individually have values so large that they would exceed the GDPs of many small countries. Second, both companies are known for their attention to detail and customer focus, at least on their core products, perhaps explaining why they have been so successful over time. Third, both companies have work forces filled with brilliant people who seem to like working for them. In short, these companies are perfect illustrations of how customer focus, employee satisfaction and shareholder value maximization often go hand in hand.\n\nEach company, though, has areas where it has advantages. The Alphabet advantage is that its core product, its search engine, enriched with YouTube and the Google ecosystem, requires less care and maintenance to keep cash flows going, with Facebook perhaps being the only threat in the short or the medium term to profits. In contrast, Apple's iPhone franchise requires the company to constantly reinvent the product and make its own prior models obsolete, creating a two-year cycle that is both expensive and gut wrenching to watch. The Apple advantage, though, comes from its history of having survived a near-death experience (in the late 1990s) and reinvented itself. Consequently, the company is much more aware of how tenuous its hold on value is and it does try harder to find new game changers. There is one final difference that, at least at the moment, is working for Alphabet and against Apple, which is that Apple has made China its biggest foreign bet and Google has little exposure to the Chinese economy, thanks to the Chinese government's fear that all that stands between it and chaos is a good search engine. If I were to pick a better business at the moment, it has to be Google. The company's core is strong and will get stronger and the biggest threat it faces, i.e., that the way we look for things may change from search engines to social media sites, is more distant that the the one faced by Apple.\n\nII. As an Investment\n\nThe quality of an investment does not always correlate with its quality as a business, with the price driving the divergence. Buying a great business at too high a price is a bad investment, just as buying a bad business at a low enough price can be a good investment. Both Apple and Alphabet are good businesses, but as an investor, my money is on Apple, rather than Alphabet, at the prevailing price:\n\nI would hasten to add that I have never owned Google, as an investor, and that may reflect the fact that I continually under estimate the profit-making power of its online advertising engine. So, feel free to download my valuation, change the inputs you don't like and make it your own.\n\nIII. As a Trade\n\nIf momentum is the biggest driver in the pricing game, it is Alphabet that has the advantage right now, notwithstanding the decline in its price in the days since its last earnings report. Whether fair or not, markets have found the good news in almost every Alphabet story and find the storm clouds even on Apple's sunniest days. As long as the momentum game continues, you will make money far more easily and quickly with Alphabet than with Apple, but just a note of warning, from Apple's own recent past. Momentum will change, almost always without any advance warning and for no good fundamental reason, and when it does, I hope that you are able to get ahead of it.", "Apple challenges government encryption demands alone for now\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Although many tech companies have voiced concerns over assisting in government surveillance, Apple is facing the latest battle alone.\n\nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have been conspicuously silent after a U.S. magistrate ordered Apple help investigators hack into an iPhone used by a mass shooter.

A surge in oil prices also slowed down, and consumer stocks fell after Wal-Mart reported disappointing sales and cut its projections for the year.\n\nThe losses were small but spread across many industries. Energy stocks fell the most, followed by banks. Those stocks had made big gains over the last three days as the market rallied.

Because today's pharma-bribed doctors do almost nothing that can't be done by a sophisticated drug vending machine owned and operated by the pharmaceutical industry. Modern doctors, in other words, are little more than robotic pill pimps who offer absolutely nothing to patients that can't be done more cheaply and efficiently by automated systems. (And believe me, Big Pharma can't wait to take human doctors out of the loop entirely. It's one less group of people they have to bribe...)\n\nBy turning \"medicine\" into a pill-pushing scheme for profit, Big Pharma, the FDA and the U.S. government have all taken the art out of healing, eliminating any value of having a human being engaged in the practice of real medicine. Now, it's all just symptom diagnosis and drug prescriptions. And that process can be easily handled by automated systems.\n\nIn fact, much of the so-called \"diagnosis\" of disease and the prescribing of pharmaceuticals can be accomplished by an INTELLIGENT TOILET!\n\nEvery time you urinate into the toilet, chemical sensors analyze biomarkers for \"disease\" (which means whatever the drug companies define as \"disease\" so they can sell you more drugs). The Intelligent Toilet compares your biomarkers to a database of disease markers that are approved by the corrupt, pharma-controlled government, then writes prescriptions for drugs that claim to \"treat\" those conditions.\n\nYour toilet -- which has been licensed as an M.D. by your state medical board -- then uploads your prescriptions to the nearest pharmacy, which dispenses your drugs while billing Obamacare to rake in the profits. The pharmacy automatically sends an order to the drug companies to refresh the pills at a 50,000% profit because the whole industry is run by Martin Shkreli douchebags. Everybody gets rich in the new \"sick care\" economy, right?\n\nMeanwhile, your COMPLIANCE with the drugs is also analyzed by your M.D. toilet, which looks for chemical markers in your urine to confirm you're consuming the drugs. If you don't comply with the drug prescription, you will have your government food stamps restricted or other government benefits reduced until you comply. Now, your toilet is not only your doctor... it's also your slave master.\n\nAll the humans who used to be actual doctors, meanwhile, are given jobs cleaning the toilets... or turned into soylent green to feed the hungry population of chemically obedient slave citizens whose only purpose is now to VOTE in elections, since nearly all their jobs have already been replaced by Google robots (that spy on everyone while carrying out all the menial labor jobs in society).\n\nThose humans who refuse to participate in this whole system will be hunted down by Google / DARPA Terminator robots or Pentagon kamikaze drones to eliminate them \"for the public good.\" Can't have \"anti-government\" people disrupting this health care system, can we?\n\nWelcome to totalitarian medicine which has already begun in California with SB 277 and the vaccine obedience laws. With medical kidnappings now taking place across America -- where hospitals kidnap children to make money by forcing them into toxic cancer treatments -- there's no limit to the horrors against humanity that will take place when Big Pharma meets AI robots and armed government drones.\n\nRemember, all the vaccine-pushing doctors across America have already established their belief that citizens should have no CHOICE in their medical interventions. If the state wants to force an intervention upon you or your child (vaccine, chemotherapy, SSRI drugs, etc.), you have no choice in the matter!\n\nEven the American Medical Association has utterly abandoned all principles of medical ethics, refusing to speak out against totalitarian medical interventions like SB 277 or forced chemotherapy on children whose parents are thrown in jail and charged with \"kidnapping\" their own children by removing them from malicious oncology clinics.\n\nWhat's especially noteworthy in all this is that compared to robots, humans should be bringing humanity to medicine via compassion, empathy and intuition combined with knowledge. Yet today's doctors abandon compassion and empathy, functioning as nothing more than biological robots working for Big Pharma which is precisely why they will soon be obsolete. (When you take the art out of medicine, it all collapses into the formulaic dispensing of high-profit medications and chemotherapy agents.)\n\nAll the doctors who are pushing pills today and thinking they're set for life with a cushy job and wealthy income are about to find out just how expendable they really are in the totalitarian medicine economy.\n\nWhat a typical doctor learns in six years of med school can be downloaded to your electronic toilet in ten seconds as a database. When there is no art in medicine, human doctors soon become obsolete. And when they are obsolete, the pharma-industrial complex will rapidly find a way to eliminate them from the system.", "Apple challenges government encryption demands alone for now\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u00e2\u0080\" Although many tech companies have voiced concerns over assisting in government surveillance, Apple is facing the latest battle alone.\n\nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have been conspicuously silent after a U.S. magistrate ordered Apple help investigators hack into an iPhone used by a mass shooter.

Courtesy Wissahickon School District\n\nLOWER GWYNEDD >> Peter Labick has the kind of resume you'd expect from a recent college graduate: three years of experience in coding, a small online business repairing computers, and his own app in the Google Play Store.\n\nExcept Labick isn't a college grad -- he's a freshman at Wissahickon High School.\n\n\"I got interested in computers around second or third grade,\" the 15-year-old said in a recent phone interview. \"I started with basic projects, working my way up the computer world. I taught myself to code in sixth grade, which was a large learning experience for me. My enthusiasm for computers really came around seventh grade when I started an online business for repairing them.\"\n\nMost recently, Labick developed his own virtual reality app for Android, using Google's own documentation as a guide.\n\nWhen Google launched its Cardboard project -- aimed at making virtual reality apps and goggles affordable for everyone -- the company also released information for developers on how to build apps for the 3D technology.\n\nUsing these guides, Labick built the majority of his app during a single weekend. \"I pulled 18 hour days to make it happen,\" he added.\n\nThe free app, called \"Cardboard City Explorer VR,\" is an open cartoon city. Users can explore the city without limitations -- all you need is an Android phone and Google Cardboard ($24 online).\n\n\"I liked the idea of a large sandbox environment to explore,\" Labick said, explaining his decision to make a map without restrictions or rules. \"I thought a cartoon city was good, because it's familiar but not something you could experience in real life. I made it so you can walk through walls, fly over buildings and walk on water.\"\n\nFrom start to finish, Labick encountered a number of bumps along the way. The biggest challenge was making the character walk around: \"That caused the most anxiety,\" he said. \"A number of things didn't work the way they were supposed to.\"\n\nAfter launching the app, Labick released a second update to clarify how to make the character move. Now, with his first app under his belt, he's focusing on his second one. Continued...", "Separately, they've been active in the 3.5 GHz arena, but now Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Intel, Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Federated Wireless and Ruckus Wireless are getting together to announce their shared commitment to promote solutions using the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band that the FCC acted on last year.\n\nSpecifically, the FCC adopted rules for CBRS, opening 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3550-3700 MHz band for commercial use. A Spectrum Access System (SAS), which is now in the process of being hammered out at the FCC with prospective coordinators, will make it possible to share spectrum where it hasn't been done before.\n\nThe six companies say they aim to build a robust ecosystem of industry participants and make CBRS solutions as widely available as possible. Private enterprises, venues and fixed operators, for example, could autonomously deploy high-quality in-building LTE networks into which all mobile network subscribers can roam. The companies say that operators would benefit from an expanded footprint and capacity on new spectrum while their subscribers could get a consistent wireless broadband experience, particularly in places like indoor locations and corporate campuses.\n\nGoogle and Federated Wireless are often referred to when the subject of SAS coordination comes up. \"Google is very pleased to be one of the companies driving this technology,\" said Milo Medin, vice president, access, at Google, in a press release. \"CBRS will benefit all participants in the wireless ecosystem, but most particularly, the users of mobile devices.\"\n\n\"We are honored to partner with other wireless networking stalwarts in enabling carriers and enterprises to seamlessly and cost effectively alleviate spectrum management challenges and substantially improve the performance and capacity of wireless networks,\" said Sarosh Vesuna, senior vice president, corporate development and strategic alliances for startup Federated Wireless.\n\nAccording to Nokia, more than 75 percent of today's global mobile data traffic is generated indoors, and the majority of customer complaints come from those indoor users. \"Our industry needs to address this by expanding the capacity of new coverage technologies so that we eliminate potential indoor bottlenecks as the capacity of macro networks continues to grow,\" said Chris Stark, head of North America business development for Nokia.\n\nAsha Keddy, vice president, next generation and standards group, at Intel said in-building cellular coverage and capacity is an increasingly important component of both enterprise and residential consumers. \"Intel is committed to work with wireless networking organizations to address spectrum management challenges, come up with solutions which cater to commercially viable coverage and capacity requirements for both carriers and consumers, and ultimately service the data demands that will be critical for 5G and beyond,\" she said in the release.\n\nThe companies are participating in the Wireless Innovation Forum's efforts to develop and drive the adoption of standards around the unique aspects of operation in the CBRS band, which include providing an interface to the central spectrum coordination systems, actively protecting federal operations and managing the coexistence among those sharing the band.\n\nThe companies are looking at doing LTE-based field trials in the second half of this year, and several will showcase CBRS-ready technologies at Mobile World Congress 2016.\n\nFor more:\n\n- see this press release", "With an eye toward a future that will include a whole lot more sharing of spectrum, Ruckus Wireless will demonstrate OpenG technology in collaboration with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) during Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nOpenG technology combines coordinated shared spectrum, such as 3.5 GHz in the U.S., with neutral host-capable small cells to enable building owners to deploy cost-effective in-building cellular coverage. Ruckus plans to drive the market adoption of OpenG using its enterprise channel and service provider base.\n\nRuckus is among six companies throwing their support behind the 3.5 GHz ecosystem in the United States. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and Qualcomm are also pledging to collaborate in order to expand cellular coverage and capacity for buildings and high-density areas.\n\nToday, much of the spectrum that the FCC has designated for sharing is being used by the military, but once the Spectrum Access System (SAS) is up and running, it will calculate in real time who's using spectrum and where, including indoors, then hand out channels based on that. The whole system involves a three-tiered sharing system, so incumbent federal and certain other radar and satellite users get the highest priority.\n\nAn important use case is getting coverage deep inside buildings, according to Juan Santiago, director of product management at Ruckus. Distributed antenna systems (DAS) address that today, but it's costly, complex and reaches a small percentage of buildings. \"It requires a lot of coordination with cellular carriers, and the cost structure is simply not there,\" he said. A lot of high-profile stadiums are covered by DAS, but there's another type of building, which doesn't have adequate cellular coverage, and DAS isn't economical. \"That's where we see this opportunity coming in.\"\n\nThe 3.5 GHz spectrum that the FCC is making available for sharing will enable the enterprises to deploy cellular just like they do Wi-Fi, which is where Ruckus comes in. It wants to offer products that serve as add-ons to its Wi-Fi products and solutions. That way, enterprises can offer Wi-Fi and cellular, with easy roaming, SMS and voice calling. (It should be noted that hardware in handsets also needs to be added to support 3.5 GHz.)\n\nToday, if someone wants to install a DAS, the operator often needs to build and pay for it, but with a shared system, it opens the door for more enterprises to cover the costs. For example, if a conference center has poor cellular coverage, it may be willing to invest in a system that supports multiple carriers in order to keep its customer happy and returning.\n\nHowever, it could get dicey if operators decide they don't want to cooperate for competitive reasons. \"What we're doing in 2016 is getting all those pieces in place, and get the word out to service providers to say, hey, this is good for you,\" Santiago said. Some MNOs are more excited about it than others, but with the investment costs shifted to the enterprise, Ruckus thinks that will become less of an issue. It's also offering to provide reports showing how indoor networks are performing to make sure they're meeting expectations.\n\nGoogle and Federated Wireless are the two most often cited candidates to serve as SAS administrators. The FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) and Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) are hosting a meeting of prospective SAS administrators and Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) operators on Feb. 29 at FCC headquarters to discuss the submission process and address questions from prospective SAS administrators and ESC operators. The meeting was scheduled for Feb. 16 but was postponed due to bad weather.\n\nFor more:\n\n- see this press release and this release", "Apple challenges government encryption demands alone for now\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u00e2\u0080\" Although many tech companies have voiced concerns over assisting in government surveillance, Apple is facing the latest battle alone.\n\nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have been conspicuously silent after a U.S. magistrate ordered Apple help investigators hack into an iPhone used by a mass shooter.

Officials for the California High-Speed Rail Authority admitted last month that construction is going to take \"a little longer than we said.\" The first leg of the $68 billion project is supposed to be done by 2022, and is supposed to whisk passengers from SF to LA in 2.5 hours.\n\nBut this total 180-degree change could totally work out to the project's favor by winning more public support and possibly helping the thing get done.\n\nPart of the reason for all the delays is that the route needs to slice through Southern California's extensive mountains, which require lots of tunneling during construction. There were many disagreements from an environmental standpoint about which alignment to take. This switcheroo allows organizers more time to deal with Los Angeles' complex geography. Plus, LA is still working on a plan for revamping its Union Station for HSR. (For what it's worth, Anaheim's HSR station has been finished for awhile but since it's furthest south it seems like it might be last in line to be linked with this new plan.)\n\nIn comparison, the Bay Area alignment is shovel-ready, plus, construction's already well underway for San Francisco's Transbay Center: a massive transit hub that will be Northern California's terminus for the bullet train. The San Jose to San Francisco route is already serviced by Caltrain, which is supposed to share its network with the high-speed train.\n\nBut there's another benefit to starting up north. The futuristic HSR alternative would be a way faster, more appealing option for the increasing amount of Silicon Valley employees who live in San Francisco and surrounding cities, but work down south. This means it could definitely emerge as a solution to SF's tinted-windowed symbols of gentrification, the \"Google buses.\" Get tech companies involved in a meaningful way, and there's even more built-in public support.\n\nThe California project might seem like a bunch of empty promises and a bundle of disorganization to some, but hey -- unlike the bullet train plan in Texas, at least this one's actually already being built.", "Lydia L.

I knew first hand that it was a difficult path to chose and that many musicians don't make a living playing music, but I was determined to make it more than just a hobby. The biggest barrier was proving those in the music industry I could do this. It was my determination, persistence, and I-don't-give-a-f*ck attitude that paid off because everyone could see I was inclined to make this work, and would not take no for an answer.\n\nI'm also fortunate that I had the ability to co-found D-PAN, the Deaf Professional Arts Network, a nonprofit that makes mainstream music accessible to the deaf community, and with my own music, that's what I always wanted, to write and perform my own songs... I never cared much for marching to the same beat everyone else was doing and jumping on other wagons, I wanted to create a wagon other people could jump on, or that could inspire people to create their own wagons other people could jump on.\n\nI work with closely with Mark Levin and Adrean Mangiardi, who are both deaf, and who are what I like to call \"Jack-Of-All-Trades\" when it comes to music, music videos, production, the three of us have been working closely for almost 8 years and have been through it all together from working at D-PAN, creating the Sean Forbes / Deaf And Loud world, touring across the country together creating memories, and of course going to a bar or two and causing a ruckus, just Google \"deaf wolfpack.\"\n\nDeaf Advantages:\n\nMost bands start out by playing in their local markets and build a fanbase locally then spreading out from there. Being deaf and a graduate of RIT/NTID certainly had its advantages, along with my frequent visits to Gallaudet where I made many friends, and immersed myself into Deaf culture. When I perform in cities across the country, I meet up with the friends I made throughout the years and once in awhile the whole band and I will crash on their couches and floors! When the band and I show up at bars to play people are always tell us \"We're so used to seeing the same old bass, guitar, drums, and a singer night after night but when you show up, you rap and sign your songs at the same time, it looks like your dancing with your hands and doing something meaningful, then you have visuals behind you with the lyrics being shown making it a one of a kind 100% accessible show\" Music industry people are always like \"You're DEAF and you do MUSIC?! WOW!\" and then when they see the whole presentation it never fails that their response is \"I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT\" that is exactly what I wanted to do. I hate it when deaf people try to be like the next Wiz Khalifa, or the next whatever already exists... BE YOURSELF, you'll get more respect that way.\n\nI'm proud to be deaf, I think that no matter what race, disability, or nationality, whatever you are... if you are comfortable in your own skin people will connect.\n\nAlso - It's a great time to be a deaf person, we have so much more accessibility to entertainment than we ever have before, we have deaf people being showcased on a mainstreamed level - Nyle Dimarco is making his mark on America's Next Top Model a hugely popular television show on CW, we have Switched At Birth on ABC Family that has been going on 4+ seasons with a huge fanbase that is in love with Sean Berdy, and we have Deaf West Theatre with their revival of Spring Awakening making huge waves on Broadway which will knock open huge doors for Daniel Durant, Sandra Mae Frank, Josh Castille, Treshelle Edmond, Amelia Hensley, Russell Harvard, Anthony Natele, Miles Barbee, and to have Marlee Matlin as the den mother of sorts is a great group, I've seen the show twice and hung out with the cast after and I'm truly proud of their hard work. It is truly important that as a community we support one another ---- so huge shout outs to all of the #deaftalent showing the world what we as a community can do and I'm excited for many more doors to open for many of us. I want to see Tate Tullier taking pictures for GQ or even taking pictures of me for Rolling Stone, Jules Dameron and Adrean Mangiardi directing a network or cable show, Shoshannah Stern and Amber Zion playing a role on network television show, Wawa getting signed to a record label by a big record company... it's time for all of this.\n\nAdvice:\n\nDo what you LOVE. When kids come up to me and my shows ask me \"How can I be famous like you?\" I always tell them \"Why do you want to be famous?\" and they can never answer that. I didn't go into music because I wanted to be famous, I went into music because I LOVE MUSIC. You should do things because you love doing them. I couldn't imagine a life without music, and if that's what you want to do, or whatever you want to do my advice is to Immerse yourself, believe in yourself, work hard, be persistent because the only person who can make this happen is YOURSELF.\n\nKristen Marie \"Rajarajeshwari\" Weiner, Creator of Deafhood Yoga\n\nInspirations:\n\nBorn Kristen Marie Weiner, I am now known as Rajarajeshwari, my spiritually inspiring name. The vision of Deafhood Yoga\u00ae was channeled in 2008, after experiencing the depth of Dr. Paddy Ladd's book \"Understanding Deaf Culture, in Search of Deafhood\". In that class, the intense dialogue with other members of the Deaf community led to a powerful moment of understanding what the concept of colonization truly meant. I had the opportunity to learn and study Deafhood in the Deaf, collective community for two semesters.\n\nWe analyzed, dialogued, identified, learned, processed and understood that the systems in our environment either oppressed or supported us as individuals, and as a cultural linguistics community. That ranges from activism, businesses, communication, education, the medical system, social economics, social justice, spirituality and more. To me, the word, Deafhood, means the consciousness of sharing a similar experience growing up as a Deaf person like childhood, sisterhood, motherhood, etc. We know what works and what does not work. It, also, is a personal journey that each Deaf person undertakes to discover their true identity and purpose here on Earth as a Deaf person. I went through the stages of colonization, decolonization and liberation. This inspired me to want the same for every Deaf person!\n\nI, like any other member of a cultural-linguistic community, will do anything to protect, preserve and pass on our culture and language. The vibrant, rich language of sign & our culture is clearly deep-rooted in the mind, the blood, & the spirit of our Deaf people. I know our Deaf culture and sign language is a divine gift to the world.\n\nYoga means to unite our mind, body and soul with the higher power, i.e. God, Creator, Brahman, etc. Many people live outside their mind, body and soul. It is time for people to connect within themselves to feel more compassion not only for themselves but others too. Around the world, every human being experiences a different kind of suffering and the ultimate goal of yoga is to reduce that suffering.\n\nMarrying the concepts of Deafhood and Yoga offers divine space to decolonize the mind, body and soul of our Deaf people because we understand. Deafhood Yoga is the gift of taking care of ourselves, to heal from colonization. Then we can move forward and take better care of our Deaf communities without compromising our culture and language. We are masters of our own destiny. Both Deafhood and yoga within, shines the light on the truth and intensifies the quality of life possible.\n\nOur Deaf people are world-wide and that inspired the vision of combining ancient cultures and language with social entrepreneurship and technological innovations creating a Deaf-centric, online yoga studio, Deafhood Yoga\u00ae.\n\nBarriers:\n\nThe biggest barrier I have had to overcome is the historical societal system that continues to be controlled by the hearing white males who do not listen to the cultural-linguistic members of the Deaf community in terms of what works for Deaf children who grow up to be Deaf adults in our society. Before I go any further, it's important that I stress the label \"deaf\" comes from hearing white males in the medical field. The term reflects the pathological perspective of deafness. The word comes with battered baggage dragging the heavy burden imposed by the historically wrong perception that deaf people are \"deficient\" and they need to be fixed. And still today, heart-breaking eugenics practices are being enforced by hearing people who have not grasped the concept between saviors and allies. This is a distribution of ignorance, privilege and wealth that's bound by ego, greed and fear. A violation of the first three Yamas of the Eight Limbs of Yoga: Ahmisa (non-harming), Satya (non-lying), and Asteya (non-stealing).\n\nThis leads to another barrier, that I continue to face: our own Deaf people, why? It is not easy to grasp the concept of colonization, decolonization and liberation. This affects all aspects of the Deaf person; emotionally, energetically, linguistically, mentally, physically and spiritually. It is an intense process which requires time, patience and compassion for oneself and others.\n\nTo study Dr. Paddy Ladd's Deafhood course through the Deafhood Foundation, contact Chriz Dally at Chriz@deafhoodfoundation.org\n\nDeaf Advantages:\n\nI know being Deaf has given me an advantage in my business. Deaf people are more attuned with what is going on, energy-wise. Sign language is spatial, tactile, visual, and kinetic which makes sign language multi-dimensional. Depending on the person who is signing, they express tones through their facial expressions, body language, energy and vibrations. It is like an \"energy dance\".\n\nIn yoga, there is the concept of pratyahara which means abstraction or withdrawal of the senses. We live in a world that is heavily based and designed around hearing. Hearing people to withdraw from sounds is inconceivable. For Deaf people, living without the sense of hearing, our experience intensifies our connection, understanding and relationship with the energy field.\n\nAdvice:\n\nMy advice for other Deaf people who want to pursue a career path in yoga and/or spirituality is to trust your intuition. You can embody your Deaf-centric principles and values without compromising the Deaf culture and language, in harmony, through your vision. Believe in yourself. You are visible. Only you are responsible for your own actions. Take care of yourself. Protect your energy. Be conscious. Balance all that you do. Create and work with other talented Deaf people to generate abundance of opportunities for each other because we understand. Just be.\n\nJonathan Lamberton, Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI)\n\nInspirations:\n\nI was working at a deaf services agency and noticed that many difficulties my clients had were rooted in language and cultural barriers. I took a CDI training course thinking that it would benefit my work with diverse clients, but I came to realize that working as a CDI would mean that any influence I had in minimizing barriers would come during the actual situations rather than after the fact.\n\nBarriers:\n\nThere are not that many training opportunities out there specifically for CDIs. I also wish there was a robust local CDI community when I started out, it is better to observe and learn alongside other CDIs. Also, coming into the interpreting world with greater knowledge of ASL and the deaf community but limited knowledge of interpreting theories and best practices, it took time to learn how to work best with hearing team interpreters in various situations with different demands.\n\nDeaf Advantages:\n\nI have lived the Deaf life 24/7 since birth, interacting with an enormous variety of deaf people. These experiences have helped me understand how to vary my ASL production to suit different people and also to consider the range of knowledge and viewpoints of deaf community members in order to present information in a way that is clear . When communicating a message, it is very difficult to identify what gaps in understanding may occur.\n\nAdvice:\n\nTalk with other CDIs to get an understanding of the profession. Freelance work isn't for everyone, there are few traditional full time positions for CDIs. Observe CDIs at work, attend CDI training and any advanced training related to the CDI work you might find in your area, e.g. mental health.\n\nMichael Schwartz, Attorney, Associate Professor of Law\n\nInspirations:\n\nI grew up during the anti-war and civil rights movements of the sixties and cut my political teeth on resistance to racism and imperialism. I went to many demonstrations protesting Jim Crow at home and the war in Vietnam, but it wasn't until the 1970's that I realized discrimination based on disability was also a pernicious and pervasive problem. As I was becoming aware of civil rights for people with disabilities, I had an close-up encounter with discrimination against deaf children at a state school for the deaf in the South, and based on my reports, the American Civil Liberties Union was able to obtain legal relief for these children. This experience combined with my progressive background propelled me toward a career in the law.\n\nBarriers:\n\nA huge barrier has always been attitudinal. People assume that if you are deaf, you are also dumb. This ignorance leads to mistakes that violate the ADA. Hearing people either pity you or hold you up as a \"supercrip\" because you can drive despite being deaf. Another huge barrier is the lack of effective communication access: lack of interpreters and captioning are prevalent all over America.\n\nDeaf Advantages:\n\nTo be honest, I don't know. In terms of public service employment (e.g., Federal and State government employment), these entities have been very accommodating of deaf workers, but the private sector much less so.\n\nAdvice:\n\nI have two responses. The first is to highlight the need for two assets: native fluency in English and a passion for the law. Both are essential to success in law school and beyond.\n\nMy second response is to ask the deaf person why he/she wants to become a lawyer. Law in capitalist America is designed and structured to protect the interests of power. Put differently, law protects the interests of white, able-bodied, heterosexual males, and while there are laws against discrimination, the courts operate to ensure that the interests of those in power aren't unduly threatened or usurped. Take the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example. It is extremely frustrating to see how the courts have interpreted the ADA to frustrate the legitimate aspirations of people with disabilities. Examples are too numerous to list here, but the overwhelming sense I have is that while the ADA has been helpful here and there, as a whole, anti-discrimination law has not been able to reorder power relations because the courts - made up mainly of wealthy white males far removed from the daily struggles of ordinary people - have made sure that ingrained patterns of marginalization and oppression remain securely in place. For instance, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities in 1990 (when the ADA was enacted) was around 70%, a figure that remains unchanged to this day.\n\nThese interviews represent only a small number of the countless individuals who are out there proving on a daily basis that when you have passion and motivation, anything is possible! Talented people who are d/Deaf can be found in every field at every level, working harder than most to rise up through the ranks. Deafness is not a barrier to success, but prejudice ignorance can be. I am excited and honored to share perspectives from Deaf professionals pursuing careers they love, and I look forward to future installments in this series!", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone. Apple says that would mean writing a whole new operating system that would then be in danger of being tweaked to crack into other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.)\n\nApple's position is really unique for this fight. On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself. Though he also doesn't discount the possibility that the National Security Agency probably could crack into the iPhone, too, but that's not what this case is about.\n\n(As a note, there's a lot we don't know about how exactly security technology works inside the iPhones, especially when comparing new ones to older ones like the 5c in this case. So experts disagree about the government's true technical capacity.)\n\n\"This is in many ways more about legal strategy than what's actually on the phone,\" Soghoian says.\n\nAnd that's a sentiment shared across the industry.\n\n\"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake,\" Jan Koum, CEO of encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, has written in a Facebook post. (Facebook owns WhatsApp.)\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai, too, posted on Twitter that he was aware of the challenges that law enforcement agencies face in protecting the public and companies cooperate based on valid legal orders, but \"that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nMicrosoft's executives haven't issued statements of their own, but shared a comment posted by the Reform Government Surveillance coalition (AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo):\n\n\"Reform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information.\"\n\n\"The real linchpin here is not the details of differences between iOS and Android, but they're being forced to produce a new version of software,\" says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nIn that sense, the case is being watched by any company whose customers' data privacy depends on their security software updates, which is a unique universe of encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal but also software makers like Apple and Google.\n\n\"Everyone is carefully watching this because if the government gets what they want here, they'll have the power to conscript tech companies to covertly deliver surveillance software,\" Soghoian says.", "Shooting rampage: Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings. -- Reuters\n\nA court order demanding that Apple Inc help the US government unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters is shaping up as a crucial test case of how far the government can go in forcing technology companies to help security and intelligence investigations.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have for years faced off against tech firms and privacy advocates over their ability to monitor digital communications, and the government to date has largely lost the battle.\n\nBut the specific circumstances of the San Bernardino case, a young married couple who sympathised with Islamic State militants and killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in a shooting rampage at a holiday party, could give government officials the legal precedent they need to reverse the tide.\n\nA federal judge in Los Angeles on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide \"reasonable technical assistance\" to investigators seeking to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the shootings.\n\nThe government argues that the iPhone is a crucial piece of evidence. But civil liberties groups warn that forcing companies to crack their own encryption endangers the technical integrity of the Internet and threatens not just the privacy of customers but potentially that of citizens of any country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates came out strongly on the side of law enforcement, raising the possibility of another legislative effort to require tech companies to put \"backdoors\" in their products.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Department of Justice was asking Apple for access to just one device, a central part of the government's argument, which Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook has said was \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\" Earnest told reporters at a daily briefing.\n\nThe Department of Justice stressed in a statement on Wednesday that its request was \"narrowly tailored,\" and chided Apple. \"It is unfortunate that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on US soil.\"\n\nMost technology security experts, including many who have served in government, have said technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes.\n\n\"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone,\" Cook said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\"\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai endorsed Cook's stance in tweets on Wednesday.\n\n\"We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders,\" he wrote. \"But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nLegal fight\n\nRepresentatives of several tech companies did not respond to requests for comment on the ruling. Not surprisingly, however, trade groups that count thousands of software companies, smartphone makers and network security firms as members decried the government's position, while law enforcement groups backed the Justice Department.\n\nThe industry was \"committed to working with law enforcement to keep Americans safe,\" the Software & Information Industry Association said, but in the Apple case, \"the government's position is overbroad and unwise.\"\n\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association said if the order was carried out, \"it could give the FBI the power to call for some sort of back end to encryption whenever they see fit.\"\n\nIf the federal judge, Magistrate Sheri Pym, rejects Apple's arguments, the Cupertino, California-based company can appeal her order to the district court, and then up the chain to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and ultimately the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit is known to be pro-privacy. \"The government ultimately will have an uphill fight,\" said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises companies on cyber security issues.\n\nFarook was assigned the phone by the county health department for which he worked, prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday. The health department had \"given its consent\" to authorities to search the device and to Apple to assist investigators in that search, the document said.\n\nSan Bernardino County's top prosecutor, District Attorney Mike Ramos, said Apple's refusal to unlock the phone was a slap in the face to the victims of the shooting and their families.\n\n\"They'd like to know details like any of us in America would like to know. Were there other threats? Were there other individuals involved?\" Ramos said in a telephone interview.\n\nMaster key\n\nDan Guido, an expert in hacking operating systems, said that to unlock the phone, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would need to install an update to Apple's iOS operating system so investigators could circumvent the security protections, including one that wipes data if an incorrect password is entered too many times.\n\nHe said only Apple could provide that software because the phones will only install updates that are digitally signed with a secret cryptographic key.\n\n\"That key is one of the most valuable pieces of data the entire company owns,\" he said. \"Someone with that key can change all the data on all the iPhones.\"\n\nThe notion of providing that key is anathema to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online rights group. \"Once this master key is created, governments around the world will surely demand that Apple undermine the security of their citizens as well,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nLance James, an expert in forensics who is chief scientist with cyber intelligence company Flashpoint, said Apple could respond to the order without providing crypto keys or specialized tools that could be used to unlock other phones.\n\nApple technicians could create software that would unlock the phone, allowing the company to create a backup file with all of its contents that they could provide to law enforcement, James said.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Alex Abdo said the government's request risked a \"dangerous\" precedent. \"The Constitution does not permit the government to force companies to hack into their customers' devices,\" he said.\n\nApple was a topic of discussion on the presidential campaign trail on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, front-runner for the Republican Party's nomination to run in the Nov. 8 election, said on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, \"I agree 100% with the courts. In that case, we should open it (the iPhone) up ... We have to use common sense.\"\n\nAnother Republican candidate, US Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, called it a \"tough issue\" that would require government to work closely with the tech industry to find a solution. Rubio said he hoped Apple would voluntarily comply with the court order. -- Reuters", "Google is set to launch AMP in their mobile search results Wednesday, but you can demo it now at g.co/ampdemo on your mobile device.\n\nAdAge has confirmation that Google is launching AMP search results mid-next week, on Wednesday, February 24th.\n\nAMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, a Google-backed project intended as an open standard for any publisher to have pages load quickly on mobile devices.\n\nSearchers should be able to begin seeing AMP in the news carousel this coming Wednesday but if you want to see them now, you can access a demo on your mobile device by going to g.co/ampdemo.\n\nGoogle told us they would be launching AMP sometime in February and they held true to their word.

Even in its US home market, Apple has faced sceptical retailers in its effort to develop a new revenue stream.\n\nChina is not likely to prove any easier to crack.\n\n\"People switch applications for significantly better experiences, it (Apple) has to deliver not just a little bit more secure, or a little bit easier to use,\" said Mark Natkin, founder of Marbridge Consulting.\n\nGreater China is Apple's second-largest market by revenue, and the world's biggest smartphone market. By the end of 2015, 358 million people, more than the US population, had already taken to buying goods and services by mobile phone, according to the China Internet Network Information Center.\n\nThe vast majority are using payment services from China's two biggest Internet companies that have existed for years.\n\nSocial networking and gaming firm Tencent Holdings Ltd operates WeChat Payment, and e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, through its Internet finance affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, runs Alipay.\n\n\"With 100% saturation of local payment systems, no one in China is clamouring for Apple Pay,\" said one retailer who declined to be named for fear of harming business prospects. \"Today, everyone has a local payment option on their phone, so Apple Pay is a solution in need of a problem.\"\n\nBanks on board\n\nDeeply ingrained in China's Internet, domestic payment services cover much more than ride hailing, food delivery and online shopping. Users can invest in wealth management funds, pay utility bills, send gifts to friends and give to charity.\n\nAn Ant Financial spokeswoman said Alipay has over 400 million active users, with 80% on mobile.\n\n\"Alipay is an app for both (Google software) Android and (Apple's) iOS system and has little requirements for the make and model of the mobile phone,\" she said.\n\nThe US firm has 19 of China's biggest lenders as partners. That means 80% of China's credit and debit cards are eligible for Apple Pay, usable at about one-third of all locations that accept those cards, Apple's Bailey said.\n\nApple's approach is to not compete with banks and UnionPay, said Bailey.\n\n\"China UnionPay and our Apple Pay solution has a huge advantage, given the footprint of China UnionPay,\" she said. \"Its merchant acceptance network far exceeds what any of the other mobile platforms have today.\"\n\nThough banks have been rivals elsewhere, industry watchers say this tactic may offer Apple its best prospect.\n\nZhao Longkai, associate professor of finance at the Peking University Guanghua School of Management, said China's banks, and state-backed payment card monopoly China UnionPay, have rankled at the popularity of alternative mobile systems associated with Alibaba and Tencent.\n\n\"The entry of Apple Pay has the potential to change the strategic landscape,\" said Zhao. \"UnionPay now has an opportunity to bring a new alliance to defend the market that it is losing to Tencent or Alibaba - Apple Pay first needs to figure out a way to win over Chinese customers.\" -- Reuters", "At a time when Apple is going to war against the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure order, the Supreme Court of Canada will hear Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal against the long arm of B.C.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courts.\n\nIn a case that has garnered international attention, the Internet giant is fighting a rare worldwide injunction issued by the B.C. Supreme Court and endorsed by the B.C. Court of Appeal.\n\nThe global order prohibits Google from displaying search results that include particular websites.\n\nGoogle insists that is way beyond Canadian jurisdiction and a huge overreach that raises concerns about free speech and the use of such orders against parties not involved in a lawsuit.\n\nThat is why the high bench on Thursday waded into the latest clash in the struggle by the courts to bring the Internet to heel.\n\nEquustek Solutions Inc., which makes complex communications hardware, alleged Vancouver-based Datalink Technologies Gateways Inc. and fellow defendants used its trade secrets to create competing products and employed bait-and-switch tactics as distributors to deliver clones when customers ordered Equustek products.\n\nIt obtained injunctions in 2014 against the firms, prohibiting them from doing business online.\n\nAnd Google voluntarily removed hundreds of URLs from its search results on google.ca.\n\nBut these measures proved ineffective and Google balked at wider erasures and at delisting entire domains.\n\nEquustek argued that such a restricted response made the injunction ineffective and the firms were continuing to sell the reputedly counterfeit products.\n\nExacerbating the legal challenges for Equustek, the alleged scofflaws fled the country and Equustek found itself playing hide-and-seek with the putative pirates.\n\nSo the firm sought the sweeping court order against Google to prohibit it from displaying search results anywhere that included their websites.\n\nNow-retired B.C. Supreme Court Justice Laura Ann Fenlon issued the extraordinary extra-territorial order on June 13, 2014 and the Court of Appeal upheld the ruling last June.\n\nThe province\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top court said the judge had territorial competence over Google because the company does business here and she possessed an inherent jurisdiction to maintain the rule of law and protect the integrity of proceedings.\n\nThe power to grant injunctions is presumptively unlimited, injunctions aimed at maintaining order need not be directed solely at the parties involved in litigation and, in this case, one with worldwide effect was justified, the appellate bench added.\n\nFor civil libertarians and those interested in web freedom, the key worry is that if Canada endorses this kind of approach, countries with more repressive views or more malleable courts will abuse it.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen various jurisdictions trying to do this.\n\nThe French in 2000 slapped Yahoo! for selling Nazi memorabilia.\n\nYahoo! tried to litigate the case in the U.S. but the Ninth Circuit ruled in 2004 that the company hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t established the French had done anything wrong to give a domestic court jurisdiction to strike down their decision.\n\nIn 2006, the French court reversed the ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down the case.\n\nIn 2014, the European Court of Justice demanded the delisting of nasty personal links for people in a Spanish Google case dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right to be forgotten\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe repercussions of that are still being resolved because there is a chasm between European views of protecting feelings and the American free-speech free-for-all.\n\nThere are major problems with injunctions for reasons that are less black-and-white and engage complex constitutional rights rather than simple commercial interests.\n\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a global sheriff because countries have different domestic laws and cultural approaches toward free speech, privacy and political satire.\n\nThis order may not offend anybody, what about the next one?\n\nAnd questions about whether U.S. courts will respect such injunctions and apply sanctions remain open.\n\nStill, although the Canadian Supreme Court probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rule until next year, I expect it to endorse such injunctions as the way of the future.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer found herself in an awkward situation Thursday at the struggling Internet company's annual conference for the makers of mobile apps.\n\nShe had to convince an auditorium full of programmers and advertising partners that Yahoo will grow into an increasingly important player in the mobile market. This while the company is dramatically shrinking to appease restless shareholders threatening to overthrow management unless things get better.\n\nJust before Mayer's appearance, Yahoo tried to underscore its long-term commitment to mobile by projecting this statement on a huge screen hanging above the stage: \"Imagine what the next seven years will bring.\"\n\nIt's not even clear that Yahoo will exist in its current form seven months from now, given that some of its shareholders want the company to sell its Internet operations after 3 1/2 years of declining revenue under Mayer's leadership. Mayer and the rest of Yahoo's board is exploring \"strategic alternatives\" that could include a sale while the Sunnyvale, California, company sheds 15 percent of its workforce and closes unprofitable services.\n\nEven though she is deviating from an original turnaround plan, Mayer has steadfastly insisted that Yahoo Inc. will still have a bright future after her latest overhaul.\n\nMayer touched upon that theme Thursday as she emphasized that Yahoo is still investing heavily in mobile devices despite the massive cutbacks in other areas of the company.\n\n\"There is incredible potential here,\" she assured the mobile developers. \"Together, we can build the future of mobile.\"\n\nUnlike her appearance at Yahoo's inaugural mobile conference last year, Mayer gave a brief presentation before leaving most of the talking to executives that joined her management team after the company bought mobile analytics service Flurry for $270 million in 2014. In another departure from last year, Mayer didn't hold a news conference after her onstage appearance, allowing her to avoid further questions about Yahoo's fate.\n\nMayer's job security is shaky because Yahoo's stock has sunk by more than 40 percent since the end of 2014, reflecting Wall Street's frustration with her inability to deliver on her promise to revive Yahoo's revenue growth. The company's revenue, after subtracting ad commissions, fell 7 percent last year.\n\nThe Flurry deal is widely seen as one of Mayer's savviest moves since she defected from Google to Yahoo in July 2012, but that acquisition still hasn't been able to provide Yahoo with enough clout to become a major player in mobile.\n\nNone of Yahoo's apps are among the Top 70 in Apple's app store for the iPhone and its share of the mobile ad market remains small even though its revenue from smartphones and tablets is rapidly rising. Yahoo's mobile ad revenue totaled $1.05 billion last year, a 36 percent increase from last year. Yet its share of the $72 billion worldwide market for mobile ads decreased slightly to 1.5 percent last year to place it behind Google (with a share of nearly 34 percent), Facebook (17 percent), Alibaba, Baidu, Twitter and Tencent, according to the research firm eMarketer.\n\nAt Thursday's conference, Yahoo introduced a variety of improvements to Flurry's app and other tools in an attempt to attract more mobile advertising partners. The company is also trying to plant its search engine into more apps as a way to sell more ads.\n\nCheetah Mobile, a maker of device management apps such as Clean Master, has been impressed with its results since it started working with Yahoo, said marketing head David Wu.\n\n\"We all read the news, so we are obviously aware of the problems at Yahoo, but all the numbers have been moving in the right direction for us, so we hope they can stick around,\" Wu said.", "Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nVideo will begin in 5 seconds.\n\nDon't play Play now More video Recommended\n\nWorld's cheapest smartphone launched in India\n\nGoogle Chromecast in action\n\nDancing with a robot\n\nFeatures of Samsung's next phone revealed\n\nError 53 making iPhones unusable\n\nReplay video Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nTesla introduces new solar batteries\n\nCEO Elon Musk presents Tesla'\u0080\u0099s new Powerwall solar batteries at an event in May 2015.\n\nPT1M39S 620 349\n\nThe only things hotter than Western Australia's scorched outback are the mining companies preparing to supply the lithium needed by the likes of Nissan and Tesla Motors to meet booming demand for electric cars.\n\nLithium is providing a rare bright spot for miners, amid cratering prices of raw materials tied to heavy industry such as iron ore to coal.

Then the crisis hit new heights: Three homeless boys were charged this month with killing two people at a longstanding homeless camp known as The Jungle. And a one-night census of homeless revealed a 19 percent spike, the third annual increase in as many years.\n\nNow the mayor and the Seattle City Council are under pressure to do more, and they are taking steps to offer the homeless cleaner, safer places to stay. This week, the city plans to open two parking lots where people living in RVs and cars can park overnight with access to toilets, garbage and social services. Officials are also planning a third tent community.\n\nSeattle's struggle to respond illustrates how challenging the homeless problem is, particularly in one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities. The area is simultaneously dealing with skyrocketing rents, a heroin epidemic and declining federal housing support. Like many other population centers, it also has a lack of mental health services and drug-treatment programs.\n\n\"We present a perfect storm,\" said Sara Rankin, a professor who directs the Homeless Rights Advocacy Project at the Seattle University School of Law. \"We have all the pressures that are likely to cause the circumstances where poverty and homelessness can thrive.\"\n\nEven as homelessness declined slightly nationwide in 2015, it increased in urban areas, including Seattle, New York and Los Angeles. In King County, which includes Seattle, there were 91 presumed homeless deaths last year, compared with 64 in 2014, according to authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, median household income and rents have soared. The median rent in Seattle in December was $1,931 a month, compared with a national average of $1,381, according to Zillow. The city of about 670,000 is expected to gain more residents and 115,000 new jobs over the next 20 years as Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech giants open offices.\n\nThe Seattle area now ranks third in the nation in the number of housing units for the homeless. But it also has the third-highest number of homeless people.\n\nAfter the Jan. 26 shooting, Mayor Ed Murray again pleaded with the state and federal government to help the city ease the homeless crisis.\n\n\"The causes of homeless are complex. There is no simple answer,\" he said. The brothers have pleaded not guilty to murder charges.\n\nOver the last three decades, homelessness has been costly to taxpayers. Seattle voters have agreed to tax themselves four separate times since 1986 to pay for affordable housing. The mayor recently proposed raising another $290 million with another housing levy on the November ballot.\n\nTen years ago, a coalition of leaders came up with a plan to end homelessness by 2015. In that time, the city and county built more than 6,300 housing units and helped nearly 40,000 people find homes.\n\nYet the number of homeless people has continued to climb.\n\n\"Despite being able to serve more people each year, we're seeing more people come behind them,\" said Mark Putnam, executive director of All Home, a community-wide partnership in King County formerly known as the Committee to End Homelessness.\n\nPrevious efforts failed to address underlying problems that are making people homeless, including income inequality, said homeless advocate Timothy Harris.\n\n\"The last 10-year plan focused on housing first to the exclusion of interim survival solutions, such as tent encampments and emergency shelter,\" said Harris, founding director of Real Change, the homeless-advocacy group and newspaper.\n\nMurray acknowledges that city-sanctioned parking lots are not long-term solutions. But, he said, they can \"provide a safer environment\" and reduce the effect on neighborhoods.\n\nSome advocates reject that thinking. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness says encampments distract from the key goal of getting people to permanent housing.\n\n\"There's nothing good about people living outdoors,\" said Steve Berg, vice president of policy and programs at the National Alliance to End Homelessness.", "IBM open sources its blockchain code - the non-crazy part of Bitcoin\n\nAnalysis Public opinion over the judicial demand that Apple create a version of its mobile operating system for the FBI - dubbed FBiOS - appears to have landed firmly against the Feds.\n\nThe FBI has demanded Apple assist it in breaking into the mobile phone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in December. Agents are investigating the pair for possible terrorist links.\n\nThe Feds clearly felt that the case represented an ideal opportunity to assert its authority over Apple.\n\nBut an open letter from Apple CEO Tim Cook in which he made it clear the company would resist what it feels is \"overreach by the US government,\" appears to have turned public opinion in favor of Apple's stance.\n\nInitial reaction was mixed - with privacy advocates and Edward Snowden predictably coming out in favor and Donald Trump and right-wing Republican senators coming out against.\n\nBut with the full details and implications now more carefully considered 24 hours later, it appears that most agree with Cook that the US government ordering a company to create a product solely to break its own security is a step too far.\n\n\"We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack,\" said Cook. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai agreed, saying in a series of tweets: \"We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices & data. Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nOther tech companies stood by Cook's position as well. WhatsApp head Jan Koum also referenced the \"dangerous precedent\" that could be set and noted that \"our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\" Mozilla's executive director Mark Surman said much the same. Other companies that have made their support public include anonymizing browsers DuckDuckGo and the Tor Project, as well as password software company 1Password.\n\nInternet organizations have also come out in support.\n\nThe Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which includes Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo published a statement in support. \"Technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure,\" it stated.\n\nThe Internet Society also came out against the Fed's plan, noting: \"We do not believe backdoors - in any guise - will help bring about a more trusted Internet.\" And the Internet Infrastructure Coalition noted that the industry \"cannot support a government mandate to weaken security standards.\"\n\nWe have yet to find a single tech company or executive that has provided anything but support - with even Blackberry's CEO John Chen refusing to comment. Chen notably criticized Cook last year for the \"disdain\" he had shown law enforcement when he refused to unlock a different iPhone. Chen argued that a \"proper balance can be struck.\" Faced with what the Feds clearly felt was a proper balance, however, Chen has been silent.\n\nThat's the tech industry. What about the politicians?\n\nIn its first reaction, the White House emphasized that the access requested by the FBI was for \"just one device\" and it seems that was the line that the FBI and the political establishment was planning on pushing.\n\nIt is indeed true that what the FBI has asked for - and quite deliberately - would only work with the single phone in question due to the phone's own unique ID. Except, if Apple accepts the legal precedent that the FBI can oblige it to create a new product solely to break its own security, it would of course apply to all devices, one at a time.\n\nDespite one Congressman, Tom Cotton, implying that Apple is on the side of terrorist and child abusers, however, the political tide may have turned against the Feds.\n\nA number of Congress critters from both sides of the aisle have come out strongly in favor of Apple's position.\n\n\"Govt's demand that Apple undermine safety & privacy of all its customers is unconscionable & unconstitutional,\" tweeted Republican Justin Amash. Democrat Ron Wyden posted: \"FBI request to Apple is bad for Americans' online safety & security, could empower repressive regimes #NoBackdoors.\"\n\nDemocrat Zoe Lofgren put out a statement making the same point as everyone else: \"The order that Apple create a new operating system with a back door, using the 18th Century 'All Writs Act,' is an astonishing overreach of authority by the Federal government.\"\n\nLofgren also threatened to use political power against the FBI's legal efforts when she stated \"I urge the judicial branch to swiftly overturn this misguided ruling and further urge the Director of the FBI to refrain from seeking public policy decisions from the courts that are more properly decided by the Legislative branch of government.\"\n\nIt is far from universal however, with Republican Richard Burr writing an op-ed in USA Today titled \"Apple should not be above the law.\"\n\nAs for broader public opinion, that is of course hard to tell, but based on the seemingly endless stream of tweets on the topic, the tide does not appear to have turned from the very pro-Apple comments yesterday.\n\nIt also appears that people are taking the situation seriously enough to find out and understand the finer points of the situation: something that happens all too rarely.\n\nThe FBI was careful not to ask that Apple bypass is encryption, asserting only that it is asking the company to unlock Farook's iPhone 5C.\n\nBut what it is asking is that Apple create a version of its operating system solely to unlock the phone. And while the FBI clearly felt this was a smart way to get around the toxic \"backdoor\" argument, it clearly didn't reckon on the fact that the American people have a hard time with the US government demanding that someone create something just for them that goes against your own beliefs and interests.\n\nAs iPhone forensic expert Jonathan Zdziarski put it in a blog post: \"Not only is Apple being ordered to compromise their own devices; they're being ordered to give that golden key to the government, in a very roundabout sneaky way.\n\n\"What the FBI has requested will inevitably force Apple's methods out into the open, where they can be ingested by government agencies looking to do the same thing. They will also be exposed to private forensics companies, who are notorious for reverse engineering and stealing other people's intellectual property. Should Apple comply in providing a tool, it will inevitably end up abused and in the wrong hands.\"\n\nThe irony, Zdziarski also notes, is that there is some reason to believe that there is nothing of value on the phone of Syed Farook anyway. \u00ae", "In a few days, Apple will formulate its formal response to the federal judge's order seeking the company's help for the FBI to get inside a phone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on. A quick recap: The FBI is asking Apple to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from trying unlimited PIN codes to crack into the phone. Apple says that would mean writing a whole new operating system that would then be in danger of being tweaked to crack into other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.)\n\nApple's position is really unique for this fight. On the PR front, it's a massive and popular consumer brand. But it's also one of few companies that design their own software and hardware, including chips, which has paved the way for the extra-strength encryption that the investigators are facing in this case. For instance, Apple built the iPhone in such a way that it only accepts software signed with Apple's own encryption key.\n\nApple's main competitors, Google and Microsoft, both have different levels of encryption implemented on mobile devices.\n\nWith the exception of the Nexus phone, Google's Android operating system is run on other companies' devices, like Samsung's or Motorola's. That has created a very fractured universe of Android devices, some of which receive regular security updates and others that don't. And Google's rollout of encryption by default in recent years has been impaired by the partners' resistance to installing special chips to handle encryption without slowing down the phone, says Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMicrosoft, too, has started to adopt encryption by default in recent years, but it has faced heat from the tech community for potentially keeping backups of encryption keys that could unlock your encrypted device.\n\nSoghoian suggests, in fact, that had this investigation involved a mobile device that wasn't an iPhone, getting inside it would be a far easier task and may not require the involvement of the software maker itself. Though he also doesn't discount the possibility that the National Security Agency probably could crack into the iPhone, too, but that's not what this case is about.\n\n(As a note, there's a lot we don't know about how exactly security technology works inside the iPhones, especially when comparing new ones to older ones like the 5c in this case. So experts disagree about the government's true technical capacity.)\n\n\"This is in many ways more about legal strategy than what's actually on the phone,\" Soghoian says.\n\nAnd that's a sentiment shared across the industry.\n\n\"We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set.

The API was designed to empower applications to both see and understand images submitted to the API. With powerful features such as label/entity detection, optical character recognition, safe search detection, facial detection, landmark detection, and logo detection; the Cloud Vision API gives applications unprecedented ability to comprehend the situation within an image.\n\nWith the new API, Google enters a rapidly developing market where both startups and major enterprises are producing cutting edge technology. From Microsoft, with its Project Oxford, to niche startups like Cognitec and Lambda Labs; image analysis is proving to be an attractive space as it appeals across industries from marketing to security. Google has taken a unique approach in that it offers various image analysis techniques from a single platform. Where many companies focus on a single feature (e.g. facial recognition, OCR, labeling, etc.), Google will go to market with a single platform for all image analysis techniques and features.\n\nGoogle originally launched a Cloud Vision API preview at the end of last year. Since then, developer uptake and feedback exploded. Accordingly, Google has now opened the beta to the broader community with full documentation, sample apps, Google Cloud storage, and pricing announcements. The pricing announced becomes effective on March 1, 2016.\n\nThe API provides a robust set of features that analyze images. API features include: label detection (detects a broad set of categories within an image; such as mode of transportation and animals), text detection through OCR, explicit content detection, logo detection, landmark detection (popular natural and man made structures), image attributes (dominant color, etc.), and face detection (facial attributes, emotional state, etc.). Apps can request one or more types per image.\n\nDuring the beta, the user quota is 20 million images per month. The API is not currently designed for real-time, mission critical applications. Check out Google's sample apps to get the creative juices flowing, and the API docs to learn more. Per usual, Google encourages beta testers to provide feedback", "This smart home hub won't ruin your decor - and it's raised more than $100,000 in one day\n\nSmart home hubs are starting to appear in more and more homes, but users who buy them face one unavoidable problem.\n\nThe hubs aren't too pleasing to the eye.\n\nConsider two of the leading products on the market. The Amazon Echo is just a black cylinder, while the Samsung SmartThings kit is a series of plain white boxes.\n\nBut tech startup Silk Labs, led by former Mozilla CTO Andreas Gal, is looking to combine style and function with its new smart home hub called Sense, which the company debuted on Kickstarter on Wednesday.\n\nWhile most smart home hubs are boxy and uninspired in their aesthetic design, Sense has a sleek, thin, curved design that rests atop a wooden stand.\n\nThe hub communicates with other smart home devices via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but it is not currently linked to any communication networks such as Zigbee or Thread, which have emerged recently in the smart home connectivity space.\n\nSense costs $249 on Kickstarter and has garnered 563 backers as of this writing. It has raised $124,872 to surpass its $100,000 goal, and it still has 27 days to go.\n\nThe device works with a variety of connected smart home products, including the Philips Hue and LIFX lighting solutions, Sonos sound systems, and the Nest thermostat, according to the product's Kickstarter page.\n\nIt also features a camera that allows it to determine who is in the room at any time. Furthermore, Sense can distinguish between animals and humans and learn the patterns and movements of household pets.\n\nSilk Labs plans to begin shipping the device in December.\n\nSense will face the challenge of standing out from a still rather young but increasingly crowded market for smart home hubs. The aforementioned Amazon and Samsung products are already on the market, and Google will release its Weave later this year. So Sense will need to find its place among these major players.\n\nWhether they are ultimately successful or not, Sense's debut is yet another sign of the imminent arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has already started to permeate everyday life...\n\nThe IoT Revolution is picking up speed and when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more.\n\nFrom connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them.\n\nImagine \"smart mirrors\" that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors.\n\nIt's not science fiction. This \"next Industrial Revolution\" is happening as we speak. It's so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT?\n\nAfter months of researching and reporting this exploding trend, Business Insider Intelligence has put together an essential briefing that explains the exciting present and the fascinating future of the Internet of Things. It covers how the IoT is being implemented today, where the new sources of opportunity will be tomorrow and how 16 separate sectors of the economy will be transformed over the next 20 years.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nThe report gives a thorough outlook on the future of the Internet of Things, including the following big picture insights:\n\nAnd when you dig deep into the report, you'll get the whole story in a clear, no-nonsense presentation:\n\nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the IoT universe, choose one of these options:\n\nThe choice is yours.

And the battleground headquarters are Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C.\n\nAs we detailed in Wednesday's Afternoon Edition, the FBI wants access to the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.\n\nApple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook is refusing to grant that access. He argues in a message to customers that adherence to the government's demands would set a dangerous precedent -- one that would threaten all iPhone customers' security and right to privacy.\n\nThis battle really got started on Tuesday, when a federal judge ordered the Cupertino-based personal technology giant to help the FBI bypass a passcode-protection system on the iPhone used by gunman Syed Farook.\n\nApple has made what I think is a compelling argument. It says that what the FBI wants the company to do is build a tool that would circumvent its important built-in security features. This would essentially create a \"backdoor\" that could leave any iPhone vulnerable to hackers and nefarious entities.\n\nSo, which side of this issue do Uncommon Wisdom Daily readers embrace?\n\nAs always, your feedback was both insightful and strident.\n\nThe majority of your responses came out in favor of the stance taken by Tim Cook and Apple on this issue. But there were several great comments defending law enforcement, and also bringing up points where a middle-ground solution might be found.\n\nDrake J. writes:\n\nI think Apple is exactly right; the government has proven in the past to abuse its power, and this is just one more extension of that outreach of their attempt to take away more citizens' rights to invade our privacy. So good work Apple, and keep up the fight!\n\nThomas writes:\n\nApple is right and I applaud their stand on protecting the privacy of the individual. Constructing any backdoor will ultimately be crashed by some hacker, somewhere. The challenge will be irresistible, and ultimately accepted. There will be hundreds of hackers attacking the problem. Requiring Apple to intentionally devote its resources to devaluing its product, which in part was developed specifically to provide this privacy feature, is disgraceful.\n\nBrad response: I think Thomas makes a great point here. Once you build a backdoor into a system, it probably won't be long before someone figures out the way it was done -- and starts attacking that way.\n\n***\n\nThis also brings up the issue of Apple being compelled to essentially devalue its products. That's because one of the big reasons many people buy iPhones is because of the cybersecurity features, and the relative immunity they offer to a host of viruses and malicious-type software.\n\nFrequent contributor Phil highlighted this exact issue in his comments.\n\nPhil writes:\n\nThe FBI only is using this as an attempt to gain ALL access via REMOTE EXPLOIT, for data mining anyone's Apple products. They do not need Bluetooth or wireless connectivity on a device they have in their possession.\n\nSomething to think about: Android and Microsoft phones already have the capability to be circumvented by the feds. Why do you think high-profile federal employees use BlackBerry phones? Why do you think Apple phones are so popular in other countries? It most certainly is not the price! Tim Cook should stand firm.\n\nOther strong points of view came in on the issue of giving the federal government more power to look into our data.\n\nAmong Uncommon Wisdom Daily readers, there is certainly what I consider to be a healthy skepticism and distrust of the government and its motives.\n\nDave writes:\n\nI don't trust Apple with private data any more than I trust the intelligence community. So ... no backdoor! The acronym crowd had all the data points they needed to catch the 9/11 perpetrators and managed to drop the ball. Easier access to data isn't going to help them anyway. So why take the chance?\n\nMarion Q. writes:\n\nIt's a shame in one way. BUT Tim Cook is right ... There is no way I would trust the government to do anything that is right with the application. In fact, who could you trust with that application? Even Tim's people could defect. Don't do it is the solution.\n\nJulian writes:\n\nI support Tim Cook 100%. This is the thin edge of the wedge to force any manufacturer of a communications device to create a backdoor to that device. I hope Google, Facebook etc., and American consumers come out in support of Apple.\n\nBut they all are part of an umbrella group called Reform Government Surveillance. RGS also counts Apple as a member.\n\nThe statement from RGS says:\n\n\"It is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure.\"\n\nOf course, there were also readers who dissented, arguing that the battle against terrorists and the enemies of the public must be fought by all, including Apple.\n\nWhile I certainly respect 'privacy-rights' and 'gun-rights-ownership,' I have to strongly disagree with your stance and that of the Apple CEO. I have been a certified police officer in our city for 41-years, semi-retired now. As a Detective-Sergeant during my last 9-years, I successfully took over 340 State Felony cases to court. Many of these included search warrants; some were for phone records (obtained with a proper search warrant). The request must be justified and within the law. These are not issued irresponsibly. The FBI needs no access to a 'backdoor' that Apple already has, only THIS phone password to apprehend other terrorists involved.\n\nAndre S. writes:\n\nI cannot believe that Apple refuses to provide this backdoor to the FBI. Is privacy more important than life? 99.9% of the people have NOTHING to hide, so why the need for so much privacy? The terrorists have things to hide. Let the FBI do their work and HELP them. Next time it could be a family member who dies because of some crazy terrorist.\n\nBrad response: While I certainly understand the passion and the need to fight terrorism, I also understand the need for Apple to protect its customers from prying eyes of all sorts, no matter how well intentioned. Moreover, it is true that Apple has a business interest in keeping its current privacy features, which is one of the many reasons why customers embrace its products.\n\nThe issue is by no means an easy one, but it is one we will have to continue to face as both the cybersecurity wars and the war against those who would like to see the U.S. destroyed are sure to wage on for the rest of our lives -- and well beyond.\n\n***\n\nFinally, reader Hans writes with what I think might be the most balanced approach to this issue I've seen yet, and an approach that I believe most of us can agree on:\n\nMany thanks for a superb article. Who am I to judge, but I think it is a good sign of a free country that a company can say \"no\" to the government. I hope they can work out some kind of compromise in the best interest of protecting North America.\n\n***\n\nLet's keep the conversation going. What do you think about Apple vs. the FBI?

While there are similarities between the two high courts -- both are \"courts of last resort,\" consist of nine judges, preside in their respective national capitals in imperial surroundings and largely control their own dockets -- there are stark differences.\n\nHad Scalia been a SCOC justice, he would have already retired at age 75 as mandated by Section 99 of the Constitution Act, 1867. But as a U.S. justice, he held a lifetime appointment.\n\nMore fundamentally, the U.S. Supreme Court judicial appointment process is highly partisan and extraordinarily politically charged compared to our comparatively cosseted and tranquil system.\n\n(The recent Marc Nadon affair gave me some concern that Canada was heading down a similar path; fortunately, the three subsequent appointments to the court have not been particularly controversial and all three appointees are, by any reasonable standard, amply qualified to sit on the high court).\n\nAs matters stood at Scalia's passing, the U.S. Supreme Court was deeply divided along traditional conservative/liberal lines, with the former holding a one-justice edge. President Barack Obama, with nearly one year remaining in his second and final term, will likely nominate a successor who holds more moderate social views than did Scalia.\n\nBut therein lies the rub. Constitutionally, the president only nominates a new justice, while the U.S. Senate must confirm the appointment (and by a supermajority of 60 senators). The Republicans currently control the Senate, 54 to 44 (with two independents), and that party's leadership is already signalling that any nominee from Obama will be unacceptable.\n\nThis is no idle boast -- of the 151 nominees in history, 29 did not pass the Senate confirmation process (although three were later confirmed on reconsideration). The confirmation process, even for successful nominees, has occasionally been a brutal process (Google \"Clarence Thomas\"). It is entirely possible that the U.S. court will remain deadlocked at four and four, and thus unable to issue a final ruling in many cases, for the next year or two.\n\nIn that event, upcoming appeals regarding controversial matters such as access to abortion, Obamacare, federal environmental regulation, the death penalty, affirmative action, unions' right to collect dues and immigration policy will not be finally adjudicated by the U.S. high court.\n\nAlthough the Canadian court has occasionally been thrust into controversy, one would be hard-pressed to argue that our high court is politicized and, indeed, while the prime minister holds the appointment power, by convention, Supreme Court justices are appointed only after a rigorous and searching consultation process that is, in many respects, much more open than most people appreciate.\n\nThe new nominee to the U.S. court is in for a nasty bit of business. I am thankful nominees to our high court need not endure such a circus.\n\nKenneth Thornicroft is a professor of law and employment relations at the University of Victoria.", "Already a subscriber, but don't have a login?\n\nActivate your digital access.Nick Francesco offers advice about sorting Favorites, copying contacts and pop-up control.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nQuestion: When I was using Windows 7, My Favorites, any new websites that I added would be listed at the end of My Favorites listing. If I right clicked on the last listing, a drop-down box gave me the option to \"Sort by Order.\" When I selected that option it would merge the added websites alphabetically into the main listing. Along came Windows 10. I imported My Favorites with no problem. However I've added about 8 more websites which are at the end of the listing in random order. When I right click on a listing (new one) the drop down box has no \"Sort by Name\" option.\n\nI've clicked (right and left) on every option (icons) at the top right of the screen getting all kinds of drop-down boxes, but no option to merge my new listings with the existing list, which is in alphabetical order. I solicit your resolve or any help you can provide.\n\nAnswer: If you're talking about using Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer, then I'm afraid the answer is no. Edge does not let you choose the order in which things will appear. Well, that's not entirely true -- you can always set them manually by moving them around by hand, but that's kind of a pain.\n\nThe good news is that Edge is still a work in progress, and one can only hope that Microsoft will add that feature in the future. This is just one of many reasons I still use Chrome, even in Windows 10.\n\nQ: I have Windows 7 with Outlook 2010. We have an address book with about 75 names in it. I have been trying to figure out how I can print out the address book or copy it to a memory stick. I have not figured out how to do this. I am almost ready to photograph the book with my digital camera. Is there any way to make a copy of the address book?\n\nA: Set that digital camera down. There's definitely a way to export your contacts. Open Outlook 2010 and click File, then Options. When the Outlook Options window opens, click Advanced. In the right pane, click the Export button. In the Import and Export Wizard window, select the Export to a file option, then click Next. Under Create a file of type, select the Comma Separated Values (Windows) option to create a CSV file. Under Select folder to export from, select the Contacts folder you would like to export, then click Next to continue. Under Save exported file as, click Browse to select a destination folder. In the File name box, type a descriptive name for your contacts file, then click OK. Click Next. Complete the process by clicking Finish. You have now exported your contacts to a file that will allow you to migrate your address book into another email client. Because it's a CSV file, it's also openable in Excel or LibreOffice or Google Sheets or any other spreadsheet program. You can also import a CSV file into another mail program (or into upgraded Outlook, if there's a glitch).\n\nQ: Nick, I have Windows 10 on my PC and my printer is a HP 6600. I recently added my printer to my PC, but I cannot print anything. The print is held in the queue, with a status of error. I am using Wi-Fi to print. What is my problem?\n\nA: Actually, your problem is that the drivers for your HP 6600 need to be updated to drivers that are compatible with Windows 10. If you go to HP's 6600 support site (http://goo.gl/SIddfO) (I shortened the URL because it took up three lines -- you're welcome), you'll see a link that will guide you through downloading and installing the correct drivers for Windows 10.\n\nQ: Hello Nick, I took the Windows 10 free upgrade and while overall I have no issues with it. There are some boxes that keep popping up that make playing some games very frustrating. I upgraded my PC to 4G RAM which is all that it will handle (I think). I have enclosed a few screen shots that hopefully you can tell me what they are and how to get rid of them. Also, I keep getting circles while playing and it slows everything down. This happens whether I use IE, Chrome or Firefox. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: What's happening here is that the sites you're going to, while they are legitimate game sites, have a horrible number of pop-ups. It looks like moving to Windows 10 turned off your pop-up blockers.\n\nIn Chrome, click the hotdog menu (the three thick bars in the upper right -- no, I don't know why they call it that). Click Settings. Click Show advanced settings. Under \"Privacy,\" click Content settings. Under \"Pop-ups,\" select Do not allow any site to show pop-ups (recommended) or Allow all sites to show pop-ups.\n\nIn Firefox, click the hotdog button and choose Preferences. Select the Content panel. In the content panel, check Block pop-up windows.\n\nIn Internet Explorer, tap or click the Tools button (the gear), and then tap or click Internet options. On the Privacy tab, under Pop-up Blocker, select the Turn on Pop-up Blocker check box, and then tap or click OK.\n\nIn Microsoft Edge: Select the More actions (...) button and select Settings. Scroll down the list to select View advanced settings and turn Block pop-ups to on.\n\nIf these don't work or if they're already all turned on, you've got some malware in your system.

Now Ormandy has found Comodo's software included a remote desktop tool that is ideal for hackers.\n\nWhen installing Comodo Anti-Virus, Comodo Firewall, or Comodo Internet Security on a Windows PC, you'll get a program called GeekBuddy, which Comodo staff can use to carry out remote technical support on people's PCs (in exchange for money).\n\nGeekBuddy allows this by installing a VNC server that has admin-level privileges, is enabled by default, and is open to the local network. At one point the server had no password protection at all - so anyone could connect and commandeer a system. That was fixed by enabling password protection, although Ormandy discovered the passwords were predictable.\n\nIf you're running Comodo's software, malware on your PC, miscreants on your network, or perhaps anyone on the internet, could have potentially gained control over your computer.\n\nAny logged-in normal user, or software running on the system, could grab the VNC password from the Windows Registry, and gain higher privileges by connecting to the server. The password can be guessed by those connecting remotely as it's rather short, simple and predictable. Basically, PCs were backdoored by the security suite.\n\n\"This is an obvious and ridiculous local privilege escalation, which apparently Comodo believe they have resolved by generating a password instead of leaving it blank,\" reported Ormandy, an information security engineer at Google.\n\n\"That is not the case, as the password is simply the first 8 characters of SHA1(Disk.Caption+Disk.Signature+Disk.SerialNumber+Disk.TotalTracks). I imagine Comodo thought nobody would bother checking how they generated the password, because this clearly doesn't prevent the attack they claim it solved.\"\n\nOrmandy reported the security design flaw to Comodo on January 19. Today, Thursday, the biz told the Google staffer that the vulnerability was addressed in version 4.25.380415.167 of GeekBuddy, which was released on February 10.

Could be a troubling precedent.\"\n\nMicrosoft's executives haven't issued statements of their own, but shared a comment posted by the Reform Government Surveillance coalition (AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo):\n\n\"Reform Government Surveillance companies believe it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe. But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure. RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information.\"\n\n\"The real linchpin here is not the details of differences between iOS and Android, but they're being forced to produce a new version of software,\" says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nIn that sense, the case is being watched by any company whose customers' data privacy depends on their security software updates, which is a unique universe of encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal but also software makers like Apple and Google.\n\n\"Everyone is carefully watching this because if the government gets what they want here, they'll have the power to conscript tech companies to covertly deliver surveillance software,\" Soghoian says."]}, "Allianz": {"2016-02-17": ["(Bloomberg) -- Allianz SE, Europe's biggest insurer, struck a deal to limit risks in the U.S. by transferring policy obligations to reinsurer Enstar Group Ltd.\n\nEnstar will assume net reinsurance reserves of about $1.1 billion and cover half of a book of business for Allianz, according to a statement Wednesday from the Bermuda-based company. The deal includes obligations on policies from workers' compensation, construction defects, and asbestos that were issued under the Fireman's Fund brand.", "The verdict is in on robo-advisors; Americans much prefer a human touch in making financial decisions, according to a survey conducted by the Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America.\n\nThe study, \"Generations Apart\", surveyed both Baby Boomer and Generation X Americans with annual incomes of at least $30,000 on how they approach their financial futures. Of the 2000 respondents, 69% said they don't trust advice found online and prefer to build personal relationships. Additionally, only 10% of individuals said they would be comfortable having a relationship with their financial advisor be strictly online.\n\nAllianz's findings come at a time when insurers are still figuring out the impact robo-advisors will ultimately have on their industry. Robo-advisors were once thought to replace financial planners, but instead have become another tool for them to utilize, says Katie Libbe, Allianz Life's vice president of consumer insights. The same will likely happen in insurance.\n\n\"It's one thing to use a robo-advisor as a tool to purchase a policy, it's another to get advice from it\" said Libbe. \"For customers, help from an insurance agent is vital because the product gets even more complex. You want someone to explain features and benefits to you. Someone who can say yes you can buy all the bells and whistles if you want, but you don't really need them.\"\n\nAllianz's survey, released in April 2015, highlights the importance of insurance agents and financial advisors, according to Libbe. To be sure, the study did find 35 percent of Americans do have some interest in working with a robo-advisor. The life insurer credits this to Generation X and Baby Boomers' growing comfort level with technology, noting most individuals would like to establish a personal relationship first.\n\nBut the jury is still out on millennials, a generation native to technology, Libbe says. Perhaps they will be the ones to trust robo-advisors more than previous generations.\n\n\"I don't see anybody talking about a robo-advisor being able to deal with insurance needs just yet. However, the technology will certainly get better and closer to delivering value,\" she said. \"At that point, people will decide if they trust the tech enough to seek advice from it.\"", "BRUSSELS Feb 17 The following are mergers under review by the European Commission and a brief guide to the EU merger process:\n\n-- Sphinx Investment Pte Ltd and CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL ]to jointly acquire British motor services company RAC (approved Feb. 16)\n\n-- McKesson to acquire certain businesses, notably pharmaceutical wholesaling in UK and Ireland, from UDG Healthcare (notified Jan. 14/deadline Feb. 18)\n\n-- Sanofi and Google to jointly set up a joint venture for diabetes treatment (notified Jan. 19/deadline Feb. 23)\n\n-- Private equity firm PAI Partners to acquire French hotel operator B&B Hotels (notified Jan. 20/deadline Feb. 24/simplified)\n\n-- Dental supply maker DENTSPLY to merge with Sirona Dental Systems (notified Jan.7/deadline extended to Feb. 25 from Feb. 11 after the companies submitted concessions)\n\n-- Israeli drugmaker Teva to acquire U.S. peer Allergan's generics drugs business (notified Jan. 21/deadline Feb. 25)\n\n-- Airbus Safran Launchers, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, to acquire sole control of satellite group Arianespace (notified on Jan. 8/deadline extended to Feb. 26 from Feb. 12 after Airbus Safran Launchers offered concessions)\n\n-- British supermarket J Sainsbury, Dansk Supermarket A/S and Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc to acquire a grocery store (notified Jan. 22/deadline Feb. 26/simplified)\n\n-- German food company Tonnies to acquire Danish peer Tican (notified Jan. 22/deadline Feb. 26)\n\n-- U.S. computer maker Dell Inc to acquire data storage company EMC Corp (notified Jan. 25/deadline Feb. 29)\n\n-- Germany's Allianz SE plans to acquire a 50 percent stake in SES Shopping Center FP 1 GmbH and so take joint control of the Fischapark shopping centre in Wiener Neustadt, Austria (notified on Jan. 26/deadline March 1/simplified)\n\n-- Italian insurer HDI Assicurazioni, which is a unit of German insurer Talanx, to acquire Italian life insurer CBA Vita, its subsidiary Sella Life and the remaining 49 percent stake in InChiaro Assicurazioni SpA(notified Jan. 27/deadline March 2/simplified)\n\n-- U.S. asset manager Blackstone to acquire indirect sole control over Norwegian publishing and paper company Norske Skog (notified Jan. 28/deadline March 3/simplified)\n\n-- Macquarie Capital and Canadian real estate investor Ivanhoe to jointly acquire real estate developers Logos Australia and Logos China (notified Jan. 29/deadline March 4/simplified)\n\n-- U.S. engineering and construction group Fluor Corp to acquire Dutch rival Stork (notified Jan. 29/deadline March 4/simplified)\n\n-- Private equity firm American Securities to acquire U.S. industrial product company Blount International (notified Feb. 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\n-- Private equity fund Lone Star Fund to acquire food and beverage vending machine maker N&W Global Vending (notified Feb. 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\n-- Coop subsidiary Bell AG to acquire poultry processing company HL Verwaltung (notified Feb 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\nMARCH 8\n\n-- Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion S.A.

(Compiled by Brussels newsroom)", "In the twelve months since Insurance Age launched #FinTechFutures, the digital insurance landscape is a very different one to what we faced in January 2015.\n\nWith this in mind, Age has rebadged #FinTechFutues as #InsurTechFutures, to give it a greater focus on what is going on closer to home; and reflect that insurance is very much in favour when it comes to somewhere innovators - both internal and external - are willing to hang their hat.\n\nAnd to tie in with the rebadging I have put together a quick hit list of some of those InsurTech firms to watch out for in 2016.\n\nThe sales pitch: Business insurance by the month.\n\nWhat we know: This business is the brainchild of CEO Laurence Shearer, an Australian whose background includes subscription programme aggregator Fetch TV and marketing and advertising agency Onepartners Down Under.\n\nHe joins a multinational board that includes chief operating officer Annabel Mekelenkamp, who is Dutch, and insurance director Ben Rose, a Brit. It is the latter who provides the insurance knowledge having worked at Ageas, Allianz, Zurich, Miller and Arthur J Gallagher, before joining the Digital Risks adventure.\n\nDigital Risks is a trading name for Enro Limited, which is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and it currently offers insurance for firms that reflect Shearer's background, namely start-ups, fintech, advertsing agencies, commercial producers and film/TV production.\n\nHaving been up and running since January, the business has a score of 8.9/10 on Trust Pilot [as of 15 February] and recently brought on former Simply Business marketing guru Jasper Martens as an advisor.\n\nWhat we know: Developed by CEO Gabrielle Hase, who according to her LinkedIn profile has \"over a decade's experience as a business owner and management executive specialising in the digital space, helping businesses profit from today's multichannel opportunities.\"\n\nHer CV includes clients as diverse as LK Bennett, Hobbs, Fenwick's, TK Maxx and Moonpig.\n\nHowever, it is Gabrielle's love of animals that inspired her to launch a new type of pet insurance company.\n\nThe site is not presently live [although it is active on social media], but a holding page asks: \"Sceptical about pet insurance? Confused? Disgusted? Frankly, we don't blame you. At CatDogFish, our goal is to make it a lot easier for you to protect your pets, and even feel good about it.\"\n\nPromising honesty, transparency and true value, it would certainly seem to have treating customers fairly at its heart, including collies and cats, alongside its customers.\n\nThe sales pitch: The UK's first artificially intelligent insurance advisory application/your personal insurance concierge\n\nWhat we know: Unlike some of the start-ups on this list, co-founder and CEO Phoebe Hugh, knows what it's like to work in a major insurance group, having joined Aviva as a graduate in 2012.\n\nHer last months at Aviva were spent as a digital proposition manager before heading out on her own journey on May 2015.\n\nAlready signed up as a digital insurance activist with Age sister title Post, when asked about the best thing about her current role, Hugh replied: \"The constant challenge and learning, knowing that when we succeed we'll have built an entirely new way for customers to understand and engage with insurance.\"\n\nHer co-founder and Brolly CTO is Chris Wessells. His CV includes the likes of money transfer app Payfriendz and start-up/small business intern network Enternships, so he is well versed in technology-led start-ups.\n\nOne just hopes that US insurance giant Travelers does not get as stuffy with Brolly as it has done with others - hello Legal & General - for using an umbrella for a logo.\n\nBut both are putting together teams with some pedigree to target a market, which given its digital adoption, is obviously proving very popular among the insurtech start-up community.\n\nWrisk has former Markel head of digital Darius Kumana on its team, whilst Zugar Znap has recently appointed Endsleigh Insurance's ex-head of digital Iain Harper, which could be a coup given his experience targeting this sector with the student focused Zurich subsidiary.\n\nThey also have at their helm two insurance entrepreneurs who have experience in starting up businesses afresh in Nigel Barton [managing general agency Oxygen] at Wrisk and Julie Rodilosso [Rarrigini & Rosso Group, Adding 1 and XS Cover] at Zugar Znap.\n\nBoth have history in selling on to larger businesses, Barton to Arthur J Gallagher and Rodilosso to THB, the question is could the millennials offer another payday for the pair?\n\nWhat we know: Unlike others here San Fransisco head-quartered Trov has been around for a bit [since 2012, raising $13.3m (\u00a39.2m) in funding], providing an app that allows people to easily reference receipts and other important information, and track the market value of their things.\n\nThe difference is that this year it will be offering its users the ability to insure their stuff too.\n\nThe person who has been lined up to help it do this is Sean O'Donoghue, who began his career in KPMG's London-based reinsurance audit team in 1989, before acting as the finance director/CFO of Hansa, working in the London market.\n\nSince then he has served as EVP and CTO of Madison Square Garden and a CIO for DreamWorks Animation SKG, which makes him far from the bog-standard insurance specialist.\n\nAnyway Trov has publicly announced that it will be working with Suncorp in Australia.\n\nWhat is less known is that it has established a joint venture Trov International UK Limited which numbers O'Donoghue as a director and is FCA authorised as an appointed representative of Axa UK.\n\nThe businesses plan to launch Trov's insurance offerings in the second quarter of 2016 with household expected to be first, and motor soon after.\n\nAgain, the pitch here is all about the millennials, and making insurance relevant to them. Speaking to the Daily FinTech, O'Donoghue spoke about the claims process involving 'chat robots' and assembling enough data \"to completely automate the claims process and minimise the effort from manual handling\".\n\nIt certainly makes a change from using robots as toys to sell insurance. More brains, than Brian if you can excuse the pun.", "Johannesburg, 17 February 2016: The Africa CEO Forum launched a Q&A Campaign #AskDelphine this week through their Twitter handle @africaceoforum and their LinkedIn page wherein they are asking their followers to #AskDelphine Ma\u00efdou CEO of Allianz Group's industrial insurer, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) in Africa about AfricaBusinessRisksfor2016andbeyond . The campaign is run in both English and French, which enables brokers and risk managers across both Francophone and Anglophone Africa to take part.\n\nAfrica CEO Forum will then pick relevant questions after a week and post the responses from Ma\u00efdou on @africaceoforum and LinkedIn and also tweet to AGCS and twitter handles @AGCS_Insurance and @Allianz. Brokers, risk managers and stakeholders can participate by replying, retweeting, liking and sharing the content using #AskDelphine .\n\nThis campaign is based on the 2016 Allianz Risk Barometer , which was released in January this year. \"Risk management is an ever changing discipline and it is important for us to constantly engage brokers, risk managers and other stakeholders beyond our four walls to get a sense of the type of risks they are dealing with and how we as AGCS Africa can work with them,\" says Ma\u00efdou.\n\n\"While businesses in Africa are less concerned about the impact of traditional industrial risks such as natural catastrophes or fire, they are increasingly worried about the impact of other disruptive events, fierce competition in their markets and cyber incidents, so this platform enables AGCS Africa to continue our discussion in finding relevant risk management and insurance solutions.\"\n\nThe drive, which should run for over a week gives AGCS in Africa the ability to interact with brokers and risk managers about leading risks on continent ahead of the actual forum in Abidjan from 21 - 22 March. Ma\u00efdou and other colleagues from AGCS Africa will be taking part in it specifically at an AGCS Africa-sponsored knowledge session to discuss the topic - the finish line: becoming an African champion.\n\nThe forum, which is attended by leaders from government such as presidents - Alassane Outtara of Ivory Coast and Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya - and business, will enable AGCS Africa to grow its followership and network on the continent with some of the most influential people in the region.", "Is fashion your passion? Take advantage of trends from local institutions\n\nWith four years of college tuition costing as much as a Lexus, there's now the option to insure your college payments much as you would a car or any other costly item.\n\nAllianz Global Assistance (AGA) now offers Allianz Tuition Insurance so you get most of your money back if your student drops out of college due to an illness or accident.\n\n\"College tuition is one of those areas where they ask you for thousands of dollars up front but with no safeguard should anything go wrong,\" says Daniel Durazo, director of communications at AGA.\n\nThe company offers three plan levels: the Essential plan for $29.95 per term; the Preferred plan, which costs 1.35 percent of the total cost of non-refundable tuition, fees, room and board; and the Advantage plan for 6 percent of same. Covered reasons include illness or injury to the student, death and psychological disorders. The Essential plan pays out up to $2,500 per term, while the Preferred and Advantage plans pay out 100 percent of the tuition cost and adds the broad category of \"any unforeseen reason,\" which is usually some sort of family crisis.\n\nWith college costs rising, it makes sense for parents to be worried. The stats are familiar enough -- non-refundable tuition, fees, and room and board at a public four-year college now cost, on average, $19,000 a year. For a private school, it's more like $42,000.\n\nBut amazingly, only 32 percent of students will graduate in four years, with only 55 percent graduating in six years, according to Durazo. Some students take breaks to work, while many others become sick or waylaid.\n\nIf you're not sure if your child is adjusting to college, the insurance can serve as a safety net. Additionally, common illnesses that can knock someone back a term, like mononucleosis, flu and depression, are covered. Students at any accredited college, including trade schools, are eligible.\n\nPlans are now available in 27 states, and the company expects them to be available in all 50 states by the end of 2016.\n\nAs for Durazo, whose son is at William & Mary in Virginia, he settled on the Preferred plan.\n\n\"You have to protect your investment and your child's education,\" he says.", "SYDNEY FC say they are confident that the derby on Saturday will make headlines for footballing reasons only, after announcing the fixture had sold out for the fifth consecutive time on their home turf.\n\nDespite the game looming as the first major flashpoint for Western Sydney since Saturday's visitors were hit with a suspended points deduction due to fan misbehaviour, Sydney CEO Tony Pignata said he was confident that common sense would prevent any crowd issues arising.\n\nPolice have liaised with both sets of active supporters, Sydney's Cove group and the Red and Black Bloc of Western Sydney, to ensure their pre-match marches are kept well apart geographically and are staggered in terms of timing, with the fans entering at opposite ends of the stadium.\n\nMore than 40,000 spectators are expected in total, which would be the fifth straight Allianz derby attendance upwards of that figure -- the game in October 2014 set a stadium record for a regular season club game of any code with 41,213.\n\nBut though a significant police presence will be deployed, no additional security measures will be in place beyond the normal protocols employed for a derby.\n\nThe last derby was marred by a pre-match scuffle between supporters, and a huge media presence is expected after Wanderers fans let off some 20 flares and detonators at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne almost two weeks ago.\n\nBut Pignata said he was optimistic that appeals from coaches and players on both sides would ensure fans behaved appropriately.\n\n\"We met with the relevant stakeholders this week and we're confident that the game will be a fantastic occasion,\" Pignata said.\n\n\"Obviously there have been discussions about avoiding unnecessary situations in terms of the fans' marches and so on.\n\n\"But the fact the game is a sellout shows again that people love the atmosphere that's created.

The result that makes football a boring game - or at least that's what we are repeatedly told here in Australia.\n\nBut that's the score line we should be aiming for this weekend in Sydney. We need to reclaim that statistic in the very best traditions of the game - with a little humour, and containing a hidden message.\n\nAt the Sydney derby in particular, let's make those numbers mean something - zero tolerance (for any incidents in the stands), leading to zero stories (for the media).\n\nFor make no mistake, the eyes of the media will be on Allianz Stadium this weekend - and, as per usual, most of them won't be there to watch the football.\n\nThe feeding frenzy that I predicted in last week's column has come to pass, so now is the time for action by true football fans. FFA has kept its promise by implementing a fair appeals process for banned fans (and that must have been hard for them to do, given the events of the last week). The football media played its part in December by backing the stance of the active groups, and defending the majority of supporters who are stigmatized by the incessant stereotyping.\n\nNow, it's payback time. Fulfil your part in the bargain.\n\nMake those who want to present the sport as a hive of hooliganism do the thing they fear most. Make them talk about the football.\n\nFor despite the headlines, and in spite of the idiots who give the haters free-kicks, the standard of play in the A-League has been terrific. Last Saturday's Melbourne derby was as high in intensity, quality and drama, as you'll see in any league in the world. Many of the other matches involving the top six sides in particular, have provided similar entertainment and quality.\n\nIn this week's Fox Football Podcast, Adam Peacock, Simon Hill, Michael Cockerill and Daniel Garb dissect all the big issues in the world of football.\n\nWhen you consider that crowds have remained stable - despite the bad publicity, no big-name marquees, a minimal marketing budget, and negligible mainstream TV exposure - that's scary for the other codes.\n\nLuckily for them, the sporting Gods smiled upon them in the shape of two teenagers (I've seen the Fox footage), who decided a thrilling AAMI Park derby wasn't enough, and wanted to make the show all about them - just as a few wannabe tough guys did at Etihad Stadium the week before.\n\nThey damaged the image of their club, and the game we love into the bargain. But football has to be - and is - bigger than those individuals. We need to isolate them, just as the other codes do whenever trouble hits their game - and it does, from time to time.\n\nIdentify the individuals as the problem, not the sport, just like the other codes do. Demand penalties for law-breakers, not the game itself.\n\n'Punishing the wrong people'\n\n6:33\n\nThis weekend, the only damage I want to read about, is to people's eardrums, from the noise only football derbies can create. Allianz will be close to full on Saturday - contrary to the fear-mongers, true fans aren't \"quaking in their boots\" at the prospect of the derby, they are positively relishing it.\n\nWhy? Because true fans know the game in Australia stands on the cusp of an exciting future, and these are the occasions that provide glimpses into what will happen over the next few decades.\n\nAsia will be the game changer. Only last week, China showed it will be the driver, with Jiangsu Suning investing an incredible $72 million to snare Alex Teixeira ahead of English Premier League giants, Liverpool.\n\nOthers, like Ramires of Chelsea, and Jackson Martinez (Atletico Madrid) quickly followed - a total outlay of nearly $200 million on just three players.\n\nFFA on flare alert\n\n1:10\n\nThat figure is more than the entire salary cap for the 18 AFL clubs this coming season, and the arrival of such superstars will start to drive up TV broadcasting rights and sponsorship, both in China - and, crucially for Australia - the Asian Champions League.\n\nThink AFL and Rugby League can compete with that?\n\nThe truth is, the other codes are operating at their absolute maximum. They have nowhere to go, and are running at full tilt - just to stand still. There's no Asian market to connect with, no global audience eager to sample their wares.\n\nJapan and Korea won't let China have their own way in East Asia either - and in future years, India will join the party. The Indian Super League averaged over 27,000 in its first season - bigger than Spain's La Liga. All that, before we even factor in the investment of the oil-rich gulf nations further west.\n\nGallop slams flaring fans\n\n1:13\n\nEventually, football in Australia will rise above the parochialism of the local market. It should not only survive, but thrive - especially as the demographic population changes here continues to strengthen footballs base.\n\nRugby Union CEO, Bill Pulver, this week gave a speech that effectively described his own code as \"male, pale and stale.\" The other codes have long-term structural problems, such as low participation bases, changing demographics and (Union aside), limited international programmes. All the long-term indicators are in football's favour, with our current short-term difficulties mainly self-inflicted.\n\n'Small man syndrome'\n\n5:13\n\nFootball's future burns brighter than any pathetic flare lit by some adolescent malcontent. The football crowd in Australia is young, multicultural, organized, energetic and innovative. It's those very qualities that make them so mesmerizing in large numbers, and a resource that - have no doubt - is envied by every other sport in the country.\n\nBut that youthful energy can also be impulsive, disruptive, confrontational, subversive even. It's up to everyone inside the stadium to make sure those energies are used in the right way - to celebrate the game that unites us, instead of starting wars on behalf of the teams that divide us.\n\nSo, on Saturday report any trouble inside the stadium, and don't rise to the bait if a TV camera is thrust in your face on the way to the ground. Smile, give them the 0-0 sign, and channel your inner Ange Postecoglou by demanding they write about the football, not the issues around it.\n\nIn short, zero tolerance, zero stories. 0-0.

In our view, this appears to be more of a one-off, and may not be the beginning of an improving trend,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities Research.\n\nHowever, private players have witnessed higher growth compared with LIC in the current financial year.\n\nThe research report said private players reported growth of 14% Y-o-Y at Rs 17,453.2 crore in APE, while LIC grew 5% at Rs 19,599.5 crore in the April-January period.\n\nReliance Life, Bajaj Allianz, Aviva and Aegon Religare, among others, saw negative APE in January, while HDFC Life, SBI Life, Kotak Life Insurance and TATA AIA continued to report positive APE growth.\n\n\"Typically, last three months of any financial year is very good for the industry and that trend we can see from the numbers. However, now with weak equity markets, we need to see how it can impact the sales of unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs),\" a top official from a leading insurance company said.\n\nThe data from the Life Insurance Council shows that total new business premium of private insurance companies stood at Rs 29,535.92 crore in the current financial year, against Rs 25,282.24 crore in the previous financial year.\n\nAccording to the Kotak Institutional Equities Research, \"We are not much excited with the improvement in APE growth as we find overall momentum in capital market inflows fairly weak. Inflows to equity funds of mutual funds saw strong fall to Rs 29 bn from a run-rate of Rs 63 bn in October and November 2015 and Rs 36 bn in December 2015.

The report shows that voluntary commitments by companies and banks are unable to prevent violations of social and ecological standards and norms, which harm the population and environment.\n\n17 researchers from 10 countries describe approx. 50 cases of human rights abuse, corruption, exploitation of workers, and destruction of the environment caused by the business activities of 20 globally active companies (e.g. ExxonMobil, Zara, Nestl\u00e9, HeidelbergCement and Sanofi), as well as the financial relationships supporting them (e.g. Deutsche Bank and Allianz). The 20 companies have total revenues of more than one trillion Euros with a profit of more than 83 billion Euros. The OECD lists complaints against 8 of these companies.\n\nThe DIRTY PROFITS 4 report presented this Tuesday in Munich reveals extensive deficits in the self-commitments of companies and banks. This refers especially to the field of human rights, as well as environmental and climate protection. 18 of the 20 analyzed companies are involved in one or several cases of human rights abuse. The report shows that 13 of the 20 companies are responsible for environmental pollution and climate destruction. 10 companies have violated labor rights, whereas 6 companies are involved in corruption and bribery. \"We cannot allow the banks and companies to self-regulate, behind closed doors, significant considerations such as human rights and the environment\", says Thomas K\u00fcchenmeister from Facing Finance.\n\nDespite 16 of the 20 companies being on the exclusion list of hundreds on international investors, 12 analyzed financial institutions still have financial ties with these companies. For instance, the financial institutions in the report invested more than 55 billion Euros in ExxonMobil, which is, to date, responsible for 47 billion tons of carbon emission. The DIRTY PROFITS report proves that 5 of the 12 selected financial institutions have financial ties to all of the 20 controversial companies (for example Allianz and BlackRock). Deutsche Bank cooperates with 19 of the companies in the report. The main underwriters of shares and bonds and loan providers are for example HSBC (9.9 and 2.2 billion Euros) and Deutsche Bank (7.9 and 1.1 billion Euros). Vanguard is also tied to all controversial companies (74 billion Euros), in many cases as an asset manager by order of a third party.\n\nIn 2012, the United Nations human rights council passed a global standard to prevent and rectify human right violations caused by economic activities, the GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. However, only 6 of the 20 companies in the report mention or support the Guiding Principles on their websites. The findings on the homepages of the financial institutions are similar. Only 3 out of 12 financial institutions (e.g. Deutsche Bank) mention the Guiding Principles as a standard, to which attention should be paid. None of the evaluated Banks (excluding Asset Managers) have implemented specific guidelines in relation to forced labour, for example in terms of business partner using forced labor.\n\n\"Half of the analyzed financial institutions are unwilling to accept even non-binding minimal standards, e.g. the UN Global Compact\", deplores Thomas K\u00fcchenmeister. Only 5 out of the 12 selected financial institutions apply the Equator Principles, a voluntary set of rules for Banks to ensure environmental and social standards for project funding.\n\nTo fully consider environmental and social standards, financial institutions have to exclude businesses from their investments that:\n\nFinancial institutions must implement extensive guidelines, which ensure the compliance of human and environmental rights. Financial institutions should establish an easily accessible and effective grievance mechanism for individuals or communities who feel adversely affected. Furthermore, they should improve the transparency in terms of the social and environmental impact of their business and investments.\n\nApparently, voluntary commitments are not sufficient. For this reason, financial institutions and companies have to be obligated by law to report the extent to which ESG concerns are taken into account in corporate decision-making and the social and environmental impact they have. The German federal government has to transpose the EU Directive (2014/95/EU) for Non-Financial Reporting into German law and should apply the disclosure obligation not only on the major and listed companies. The federal government should ensure that the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights take account of the responsibility of the financial sector.", "Company-specific products can be compared for clients' best interests\n\nRetireUp, a retirement income planning software provider, partnered with two insurance companies this week to allow advisers to drag and drop the insurers' fixed-indexed annuity products into clients' retirement plans for a quick analysis of what works and what doesn't.\n\nWith this tool, advisers will be able to instantly see and illustrate how fixed-indexed annuities from Great American Insurance Group and Allianz Life Insurance Co. would affect a client's retirement income plan and compare them to other retirement investment products and strategies. Advisers can move around within the system to see what would happen if some money from current portfolios was moved to an annuity.\n\n\"We didn't want to be a sales tool for annuities,\" said Dan Santner, chief executive and co-founder of RetireUp. \"We show you immediately in front of your face what would happen. A lot of plans come together, some fall apart.\"\n\nAllianz was the leader in indexed annuity sales at the end of 2014 with 27.71% of the market share, according to InvestmentNews. Great American was fourth, at 6.43%. Fixed-indexed annuity products on RetireUp's platform include Great American Life's American Legend III with the IncomeSecure rider, and Allianz 222 and Allianz Core Income 7.\n\nMr. Santner said more annuity products will follow.\n\nBrad Johnson, vice president of adviser development at Advisors Excel, an insurance marketing organization, noted that as pensions go away, advisers can use annuities to provide clients more flexibility and less risk of not having retirement income.\n\n\"An annuity is simply a lever -- you can dial up or down the risk inside of your portfolio,\" Mr. Johnson said.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean annuities always fit with a client's retirement plan, said Phil Lubinski, a founding partner of First Financial Strategies and the training curriculum developer for WealthConductor, a retirement income planning tool from 3D Asset Management. WealthConductor does not illustrate specific companies' products, but can be used to assess the advantages or disadvantages of using annuities as part of an income floor.\n\n\"The first step is to determine if it makes sense in the plan to use an indexed annuity,\" he said.\n\nMr. Lubinski said advisers may not want to use an indexed annuity for long-term growth for clients who don't need that money for 15 to 25 years because the cost of the guarantees in most annuities can be high.\n\nBut advisers are always looking for more retirement income planning technology tools to help with this type of analysis, he said, especially given the regulatory environment.\n\nAnalyzing annuities directly in a plan can open advisers' eyes to the recommendations they may already be making, showing potentially better options to offer their clients, Mr. Santner said. This could come in handy especially if the Department of Labor finalizes its fiduciary rule, which would require advisers to act in their clients' best interest when managing retirement accounts.\n\n\"We believe you will see advisers are going to be under more scrutiny to provide rationale for recommendations they are providing,\" Mr. Santner said.", "\"What we see still is extreme volatility,\" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, in the price of oil.

We live in a world where economic headlines are perpetually dominated by issues such as the price of oil, Asian growth numbers, or forecast currency moves. But are these really the most important drivers of investor returns, and are they even possible to forecast reliably?\n\nWithin my team, we would argue that the vast majority of investors do not place sufficient emphasis on the long-term drivers of share prices; business models. The last year has painfully demonstrated both the difficulty and flaws of reliably forecasting many macro factors, for which often the only guarantee, is that there are no guarantees, as short-term prices are influenced by unknown future policy decisions, geopolitical factors and event risks. Even for those, wiser than us, who can reliably forecast these factors, we remain unconvinced that they materially drive asset prices over the long term. For example, much is made of regional GDP growth rates, or PMI data, but the correlation of these factors with share price performance has historically been low.\n\nThere are however, certain factors, that are both much more durable and visible through investment cycles than macro issues and these are business models themselves. In most instances, it takes companies years, if not decades, to create clear competitive advantages, but for those companies that are able to establish the famous 'moat' or barriers to entry around their business, these competitive advantages will likely last far longer than any one business cycle. In Europe, where we invest, we see many opportunities for long-term investors. With deep analysis you can find examples of such long-term competitive advantages in almost any industry, whether it is through a brand, as in fashion retailing (e.g. LVMH), the business model (e.g. Inditex, which benefit from far shorter product cycles than competitors), product superiority (e.g. Novo Nordisk) or simply best execution (e.g. DSV)\u00b9.\n\nThe competitive positioning of high quality businesses is usually far more relevant to a company's long term development than any current regional growth rate, or any short term currency move. For example Novo Nordisk1, the global leader in diabetes care, have consistently grown earnings independently of the state of the wider economy, as shown by their ability to grow their EPS every consecutive year since 1998, even during recessionary periods. This structural growth has been achieved through best in class execution, product innovation, barriers to entry and market share gains, which will always be more important for the long- term investor than any of the supposed macro storms that regularly appear on the horizon. Within our investment team we seek to apply these beliefs in practice. We take time to find the strongest companies with the best business models, and we hold them for the long term, ignoring short-term noise. We believe that, given the current economic backdrop we see now, this is advice many investors should heed.\n\nTo find out more about Matthias Born and the Allianz Continental European Fund please visit www.allianzcontinentaleuropean.co.uk.\n\n\u00b9This is no recommendation to buy or sell any particular security", "BRUSSELS Feb 18 The following are mergers under review by the European Commission and a brief guide to the EU merger process:\n\n-- Private equity firm Equistone Partners Europe SAS to acquire car parts maker Mecaplast Group (notified Feb. 16/deadline March 22/simplified)\n\n-- Slot machine maker Loewen Entertainment German gambling halls operator Safari Holding and Schmidt Gruppe Service Gesellschaft fur Spielerschutz und pravention to set up a joint venture (notified Feb. 10/deadline March 16/simplified)\n\n-- McKesson to acquire certain businesses, notably pharmaceutical wholesaling in UK and Ireland, from UDG Healthcare (notified Jan. 14/deadline Feb. 18)\n\n-- Sanofi and Google to jointly set up a joint venture for diabetes treatment (notified Jan. 19/deadline Feb. 23)\n\n-- Private equity firm PAI Partners to acquire French hotel operator B&B Hotels (notified Jan. 20/deadline Feb. 24/simplified)\n\n-- Dental supply maker DENTSPLY to merge with Sirona Dental Systems (notified Jan.7/deadline extended to Feb. 25 from Feb. 11 after the companies submitted concessions)\n\n-- Israeli drugmaker Teva to acquire U.S. peer Allergan's generics drugs business (notified Jan. 21/deadline Feb. 25)\n\n-- Airbus Safran Launchers, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, to acquire sole control of satellite group Arianespace (notified on Jan. 8/deadline extended to Feb. 26 from Feb. 12 after Airbus Safran Launchers offered concessions)\n\n-- British supermarket J Sainsbury, Dansk Supermarket A/S and Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc to acquire a grocery store (notified Jan. 22/deadline Feb. 26/simplified)\n\n-- German food company Tonnies to acquire Danish peer Tican (notified Jan. 22/deadline Feb. 26)\n\n-- U.S. computer maker Dell Inc to acquire data storage company EMC Corp (notified Jan. 25/deadline Feb. 29)\n\n-- Germany's Allianz SE plans to acquire a 50 percent stake in SES Shopping Center FP 1 GmbH and so take joint control of the Fischapark shopping centre in Wiener Neustadt, Austria (notified on Jan. 26/deadline March 1/simplified)\n\n-- Italian insurer HDI Assicurazioni, which is a unit of German insurer Talanx, to acquire Italian life insurer CBA Vita, its subsidiary Sella Life and the remaining 49 percent stake in InChiaro Assicurazioni SpA(notified Jan. 27/deadline March 2/simplified)\n\n-- U.S. asset manager Blackstone to acquire indirect sole control over Norwegian publishing and paper company Norske Skog (notified Jan. 28/deadline March 3/simplified)\n\n-- Macquarie Capital and Canadian real estate investor Ivanhoe to jointly acquire real estate developers Logos Australia and Logos China (notified Jan. 29/deadline March 4/simplified)\n\n-- U.S. engineering and construction group Fluor Corp to acquire Dutch rival Stork (notified Jan. 29/deadline March 4/simplified)\n\n-- Private equity firm American Securities to acquire U.S. industrial product company Blount International (notified Feb. 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\n-- Private equity fund Lone Star Fund to acquire food and beverage vending machine maker N&W Global Vending (notified Feb. 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\n-- Coop subsidiary Bell AG to acquire poultry processing company HL Verwaltung (notified Feb 1/deadline March 7/simplified)\n\nMARCH 8\n\n-- Celulosa Arauco y Constitucion S.A.

The report responds to a UK government consultation on the ambitious pooling of local government pension schemes (LGPS), the deadline for which is tomorrow.\n\n\"To date London CIV has seen fee reductions of up to 50%\" during the first phase of asset pooling, Grover stated. This phase included the launch in December of a global equity mandate run by Allianz Global Investors and backed by three London pension funds.\n\n\"It should be recognized that the first phase represents relatively low cost asset classes with the majority being invested in passive asset classes,\" Grover added. \"It is inevitable that as more complex and expensive assets are added then fee savings will significantly increase.\"\n\nNegotiations with custodians and other service providers could add further savings, he noted.\n\nIn November, a seven-strong pool of funds based in the Midlands region reported cost savings of more than 50% after striking a deal with Legal & General Investment Management to run passive and smart beta strategies. The group now consists of eight funds and \u00a335 billion of assets.\n\nThe London CIV expects to launch a further eight funds by the end of next month. These will include a second actively managed global equity mandate, two passive developed market equity funds, two passive UK equity funds, two passive emerging market equity funds, and a diversified growth fund. The funds will total \u00a36.1 billion -- just under quarter of the 31 London pensions' total assets -- with 20 pensions invested.\n\n\"It is anticipated that every participating [pension] will have opportunities to migrate to the CIV by March 2017,\" Grover said.\n\nIn a separate response to the consultation, investment management giant BNY Mellon claimed that the LGPS should form \"two or three infrastructure super pools\" to ensure sufficient scale for public pensions allocating to the asset class.\n\n\"Creating infrastructure portfolios in excess of \u00a36 billion would create even more synergies, allowing [LGPS] to access a wider range of infrastructure opportunities, and enabling them to achieve greater diversification across the portfolio,\" the asset manager said.\n\nIncreasing pensions' allocation to infrastructure is a cornerstone of the UK government's push to pool assets, led by Chancellor George Osborne. Osborne has targeted the creation of six \"British Wealth Funds\" from LGPS assets.\n\nRelated: London United\n\nNick Reeve | nreeve@assetinternational.com | (44) 207 397 3827", "By the age of 60, most Malaysian retirees will have to face life without assets or savings, according to Allianz Asset Management.\n\nThis is because most of them would have used up their retirement savings within five years, said Brigitte Miksa, head of international pensions at Allianz Asset Management.\n\n\"At 60, the nation's official retirement age, Malaysians may well find themselves with no assets left yet with roughly 20 more years to live,\" she added in a statement.\n\n(The Employees Provident Fund allows contributors to withdraw the full amount at the age of 55).\n\nMiksa said that at prevailing savings rates, most Malaysians would have to survive on a third of their salaries.\n\nThis is far lower than the Organisation of Economic Corporation Development (OECD) benchmark of 60-70 percent, she added.\n\nShe said Allianz's Retirement Income Adequacy indicator ranks Malaysia 49th worldwide, because the Employees Provident Fund is \"one of the least adequate\".\n\nThis is made worse by findings that two months out of every year added to life would be spent ill.\n\nMiksa said to avoid outliving one's savings, Malaysians should look to building a nest egg that is 12 to 14 times larger than their last drawn annual salary.\n\nThis means setting aside 13-18 percent annually, she said.\n\nMalaysians could also look to delaying their retirement age to 65, so they need to only save three percent of annual salary to have a reasonably comfortable retirement.\n\nWhile the general picture does not look good for Malaysian retirees, Miksa said Malaysian women are in a better position.\n\nShe said statistics show that women aged 30-34 earn 14 percent more than their male counterparts.\n\nWith females making up 55 percent of the Malaysian job market, Malaysian women are more likely to escape the fate of a dreary retirement befalling many women worldwide due to longer life expectancy.", "Claimant argued that use of personal protective equipment was not enforced at diamond drilling firm\n\nA judge has thrown out a noise-induced hearing loss claim against insurer Allianz because it was \"fundamentally dishonest\".\n\nAt an appeal hearing in Coventry on 8 February Judge Gregory also granted Allianz permission to recover its legal costs from the claimant, which the insurer said was a first for disease claims.\n\nThe hearing loss claim was made against Allianz customer Diamanttek, a diamond drilling company. The claimant was employed by Diamanttek between 2003 and 2013.\n\nThe claimant argued that Diamanttek did not enforce the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before 2013. He further argued that until this date, no training had been provided about the correct use of hearing protection, and no warnings were provided about the dangers of noise exposure.\n\nBut Allianz's investigations showed that the claimant was supplied with PPE throughout his employment, and denied liability. It appointed law firm Keoghs to defend its case.\n\nDuring the first hearing, Deputy District Judge Kilbane rejected the claimant's evidence and dismissed the case.\n\nBut the judge was not willing to rule that the claim was \"fundamentally dishonest\" and so refused Allianz's application for the removal of qualified one-way cost shifting (QOCS) for the claimant.\n\nQOCS protects the claimant against having to pay the defendant's costs if the defendant wins, but it can be waived if the claim is found to be \"fundamentally dishonest\".\n\nFollowing an appeal by Allianz, Judge Gregory found that the claim was \"fundamentally dishonest\".\n\nAllianz head of technical claims Sarah Mallaby said: \"The outcome of this case is great news for the insurance industry.\n\n\"It underpins the principles of the law reforms which came into force in 2013 and we believe that this should now set a precedent for future disease claims.\n\nKeoghs partner Stephen Croston added: \"This is an important decision for the market, providing much needed guidance in an emerging area of the law.\"", "Allianz S.E. has entered into an agreement to cut its risks in the United States by transferring policy obligations to Bermudan run-off specialist Enstar Group Ltd., reported Bloomberg.\n\nEnstar said that it will assume net reinsurance reserves of around $1.1 billion and cover 50% of a book of business for Allianz.

It might be Cavafy's \"Waiting for the Barbarians,\" or Auden's \"The Fall of Rome,\" not to mention Kipling's \"Recessional\" and \"The White Man's Burden.\" Published in 1898, the latter's subtitle, more interesting than its lurid title, is \"The United States and The Philippine Islands,\" but might just as well be \"The United States and the Middle East\" more than a century later, with its warning about \"The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard.\"\n\nAnd of course, \"The Second Coming.\" In that extraordinary, oracular work, W.B. Yeats was not making a trite political statement. Although the lines\n\n\"Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\"\n\nwere in part inspired by Ireland, where a brutal terrorist campaign was being waged (dignified as a \"War of Independence\"), about which Yeats, the sentimental nationalist who also identified with the Protestant Ascendancy, had such mixed feelings, they were not meant to be a guide to everyday politics. Yet the words \"the centre cannot hold\" and \"The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity,\" written in 1919, seemed all the more forceful with every year over the next decades of totalitarianism, total war and total murder. So they do again today.\n\nWe have witnessed the explosion of the Levant and the implosion of Europe, the rise of demagogues on both the Left and, more notably, on the Right, on both sides of the Atlantic. The internal atrophy of democratic politics in the United States is another question, although one that Americans appear reluctant to address. Anyone can deride Donald Trump's vulgarity, but those who do so are less inclined to ask what possible reason there is why Hillary Clinton should be president, or whether the Americans can really lecture benighted Mahometan savages about the benefits of democracy when little more than one American citizen in three bothered to vote at the last midterm elections in 2014 (one in five in Mississippi and Utah). And in any case, whoever votes, the United States is blessed, as Mark Twain was the first to observe, with the best Congress money can buy.\n\nBUT WE Europeans should hesitate before sneering in turn. Constitutional representative government is always a fragile plant, which needs to be carefully tended and nurtured, and doesn't always flourish of its own accord. What has happened in these recent years is not just the near collapse of the European Union, but the demonstration of its complete inadequacy to deal with present dangers, from the self-inflicted and unresolvable crisis of a single currency which was never what English law calls \"fit for purpose,\" to the awful problem of mass immigration from mostly Muslim countries in western Asia and north Africa -- a problem both for Europe and for the countries the migrants leave.\n\nBeyond that is the acute threat within Europe to political stability. That stability was based on an unwritten agreement, what was sometimes a far too cozy and smug consensus between ostensibly moderate parties, \"center-right\" and \"center-left.\" It's this consensus that is now being severely challenged from the outside left and outside right by parties and politicians called \"extremist\" or, much more revealingly, \"populist.\"\n\nThis is true in the Eastern European countries that have only been free of dictatorship and Soviet imperialism for a quarter-century, and have belonged to the European Union for little more than ten years. They have shown alarming signs of sliding back into authoritarianism, nativism, racism and corruption. But then maybe the hopes held for their immediate evolution into a liberal democracy most of them had never known was always illusory, particularly in Hungary and Poland, the latter of which appears to ape the former as it conducts what amounts to a Gleichschaltung of its state institutions.\n\nMore perturbing are events in the Western European countries that created the new Europe, the original six which signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951 (creating the European Coal and Steel Community), and then the Treaty of Rome in 1957 (creating the Common Market or European Economic Community). The three largest of these countries were France, Germany and Italy. Their recent experience is somber.\n\nIN FRANCE, the old liberal consensus is threatened principally by the Front National. Its origins are dark, and merited the label \"neofascist\" when its leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (suspected of torture and murder when he was a French soldier in the squalid Algerian war) used blatantly racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric. His daughter Marine is much cleverer and better attuned to the public mood than her father. She has tried to pursue \"de-demonisation,\" to the point of expelling her own father from the party, but the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim tone persists.", "I am struck by the fact that the views of the JNU alumni and the views of those who are not from the institution are almost diametrically opposite to each other. While JNU alumni are alarmed at the systematic, planned defaming of their university, others seem to be absorbing the official view uncritically.\n\nAs an alumna of the university, I can speak on behalf of the students when I say that most JNU students experience a sense of self-transformation on the campus not because the place is \"full of Left-leaning people\", but because they are freed from their narrow regional contexts when they come face-to-face with students from other regions, classes and castes.\n\nIn classrooms, we study about these places and people rationally and critically, and learn not to merely swallow whatever the media or the ruling party says. For instance, even when JNU students disagree with anti-India slogans, they try to explore where these views come from. JNU brings to its students a pluralistic, open vision of India that renders the country's poorest and most underprivileged visible. As middle-class students, we learn that the Indian middle class ought to serve the poorest and keep them visible in the eye of the state.\n\nHowever, this vision is precisely what a rabid section of the right wing wants to destroy. The middle class in India does not recognise even the existence of underprivileged citizens. Therefore, it becomes easy for them to swallow the right wing's vision of India as a country of the Hindu upper-caste middle class. While people are critical of the debate on Afzal Guru's hanging, no one seems worried that there are daily insults to our Constitution by some members of the Sangh Parivar, including MLAs and MPs. Why is there an uproar over JNU but not over these statements? It is sad that social scientists of repute are being targeted simply for taking the side of democracy.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that two sacred institutions, JNU and the Supreme Court, are being defiled by a few disgruntled elements. While the reputation of a prestigious university, which has produced a number of noted statesmen, is being tarnished by a group of students shouting anti-national slogans, the reputation of the court is also being tarnished as Afzal Guru was tried and convicted by the court and it is in support of him that slogans are being shouted. If this issue is used to stall Parliament, it will be a stumbling block in the progress of our country.\n\nThe events unfolding in JNU are eroding the values ingrained in our Constitution. The government is muffling voices of dissent in the name of nationalism. Where are we heading? Dubbing every form of dissent as anti-national smacks of dictatorship. What is most astonishing is the cryptic silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is passively supporting the autocratic activities of his lieutenants.\n\nIt is distressing to note that pro-Afzal Guru slogans are now being chanted in Jadavpur University (\"Jadavpur University: Pro-Afzal slogans\", Feb. 17). This would not have been possible without the support of the opposition parties. Protests against the nation amount to rebellion. They should be strictly controlled and action must be taken by the government. It is clear that the opposition parties simply want to criticise the government at any cost, even if that cost is the nation itself. Criticising the government is the same as criticising those who elected it to power.\n\nPeter Ronald deSouza has clearly stated the role that the most socially sensitive campus of this country has played in producing excellent bureaucrats, politicians and intellectuals (\"JNU, and the idea of India\", Feb. 17). I respect the freethinking and inclusive spirit that JNU inculcates in the minds of its students. The campus is known to have an in-built capacity to detect mild as well as serious versions of totalitarianism or quasi-fascism, and so the students of this university naturally speak up against such ideas or acts.\n\nThis campus has always remained a dream for many; I hope whatever defines this university will not change because of this crisis.\n\nThere is no need to glorify JNU. No one is stifling dissent. We read about various issues and opinions everyday, but no is arrested for these opinions. What led to Kanhaiya Kumar's arrest was something very serious. The governing dispensation feared that the speeches and sloganeering were inciting violence. Dissent and discussion cannot be used as terms to hide what is hate speech.\n\nThe JNU incident cannot be seen in isolation; it is linked to what is happening in the rest of the country. There is a method to this madness. The Sangh Parivar wants to thrust a uniform culture on India instead of respecting and celebrating the country's diversity, and this incident is a part of such efforts. It is strange that while sloganeering is not tolerated, violence is justified. Acts against the people of this country can be seen as seditious, not sloganeering against the ruling dispensation.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between what happened during the Emergency and what is happening now. Democratic rights had been suspended then but now efforts are being made to stifle voices in a democratic set-up.", "Vox magazine just published a video on YouTube narrated by Max Fisher that supposedly explains how the next Iranian election could make history. He starts by saying that Iran is confusing because it has \"an unelected Supreme Leader at the top\" and a president who is chosen in \"far from perfect\" elections. \"So is Iran a dictatorship, or is it a democracy?\" he asks before answering, \"as it turns out, it's both.\" No, it's not. Max Fisher answered the question correctly before he answered it. The head of state isn't elected. And his description of the elections as \"far from perfect\" is the kind of condescending euphemism that's only ever used to describe somebody else's problems. Let's leave aside the blatant vote-stealing in Iran's 2009 presidential election, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner in districts that opposed him as overwhelmingly as San Francisco opposes Dick Cheney. Nevermind that disgraceful episode. Elections in Iran are rigged even when they aren't rigged. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei hand-picks everybody who runs for president. Moderates are rejected routinely. Only the less-moderate of the moderates -- the ones who won't give Khamenei excessive heartburn if they win -- are allowed to run at all. Liberal and leftist candidates are rejected categorically. Imagine Dick Cheney as the overlord of America allowing us to choose which one of his friends will be in the co-pilot's seat. That's not democracy. That's not even a fake democracy. The Iranian system is worse, though. The president isn't even the co-pilot. He's not quite a figurehead. He can tinker with a few things around the edges. But the country is run by the unelected Supreme Leader, the Guardian Council, and the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is officially designated as a terrorist organization. Fisher thinks the upcoming election may be a game-changer, though, because the so-called Assembly of Experts is an elected body, it will choose the next Supreme Leader, and the current Supreme Leader acknowledges that he's likely to die soon. Therefore, if \"moderates\" win the election, the next Supreme Leader will almost certainly be a moderate. That would be great. Really, it would. I'd pop a champagne cork. Iran would still be a dictatorship/democracy hybrid in Fisher's formulation, but at least it would be a less extreme one. It could be like post-Maoist China, perhaps, or post-Soviet Russia. Unfree, but no longer totalitarian. It would be progress. No doubt about it. But \"moderates\" in the Iranian regime aren't moderate by any objective international definition. Everyone who gets to run in the election for the Assembly of Expert will be hand-picked by the Supreme Leader. And every single one of them will be an Islamic theologian. That's what the Assembly of Experts is. A theocratic institution of Islamic theologians. None of the \"experts\" are atheists. None of them are secularists. None of them are agnostic. None of them are liberals under any conceivable definition of the word liberal. Certainly none of them are Christians, Jews or Baha'is. They're all Islamic theologians or they wouldn't even be in the Assembly of Experts. So let's run another thought experiment here. Let's say Christian fundamentalist Pat Robertson is the dictator-for-life in America. He's more powerful than the White House. We get to vote for the president even though he isn't our head of state, but Pat Robertson decides all by himself who's on the ballot. And he chooses Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. Those are our options. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio is unemployed, Hillary Clinton is under house arrest and Bernie Sanders is languishing in an orange jumpsuit at the Camp X-ray prison in Guantanamo Bay. Liberal activists who complain in the streets vanish into dungeons forever. Meanwhile, Pat Robertson is going to die soon, so he hand-picks hundreds of Evangelical Christians that we get to vote for or against. The winner will choose who replaces him. Does that sound even remotely like a democracy? Like a system that has authoritarian elements alongside democratic elements? Not to me, it doesn't. And I'd bet my bottom dollar that Max Fisher wouldn't think so either if he had to live in such a distorted version of America. He'd call it fascist, or something similar, and he would be right. Vox uploaded the video to Facebook as well as to YouTube, and the comments are overwhelmingly hostile. Huge numbers of Iranian grownups are chiming in and schooling the Vox kids.

Meanwhile, scholars and historians view the establishment of the Islamic Republic as the darkest moment in Iran's rich, long history. Thirty-seven years ago, the forward progress of the nation ceased, and Iranians began living under tyranny, oppression, and shocking human rights violations that have sadly been the norm for thirty-seven years.\n\nThirty-seven years have passed since the Islamists seized on the popular uprising and the established the Islamic Republic in our country. These ideologues cleansed the nation of any progressive thinkers and opposition, ushering in a tumultuous, bloody period. They possess a shocking inability to manage the functions of state, and the list of failures is long: the country's environment has been systematically destroyed; political corruption, bribery, substance abuse, prostitution, economic injustice, youth crimes are rampant; and suppression of women, irreverence for military veterans and heroes, arbitrary imprisonment, humiliation, torture and execution have been the norm. In addition, millions of Iranian citizens have been rendered homeless while others have been displaced abroad.\n\nThe Islamic Republic's record in international relations is just as bad. In the name of religion and the struggle against western imperialism, the Islamic Republic raised its flag in Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Yemen, and has destabilized the region.\n\nThe popular uprising of 2009 gave the world ample evidence that Iranian citizens feel that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not an acceptable and legitimate form of government.

Let us not forget, not voting is a powerful vote against the Islamic Republic. Not voting will show the entire world that we are saying 'no' to the whole entity of the Islamic Republic's regime.\n\nWe can liberate ourselves from the oppression and build the government and society we want in Iran.

More practically, though, it boils down to this question: Should you be able to lock your phone so securely that even the F.B.I. cannot open it?\n\nThe Obama administration and police officers around the country say no, and their precedent is the past. Homes and cars do not have unbreakable locks. You cannot buy an uncrackable safe. And terrorists and child molesters should not be able to buy a hand-held computer that keeps its secrets forever.\n\nApple, backed by technologists and civil libertarians, says yes. People live their lives electronically; their phones are a record of loves and fantasies, illnesses and losses. Apple built its recent iPhones to keep that data private and says nothing less than the future of privacy is at stake in this fight.\n\nThe Justice Department's success in obtaining a court order demanding that Apple help write software to disable those defenses was a significant victory for the Obama administration. It relied on the All Writs Act, a law that can trace its origins to the first Congress in 1789. In short, it says courts can require that people do things to comply with their orders.\n\nFor months, the Justice Department and Apple have been trading heated rhetoric and lurching toward this very confrontation, only to back away. By the end of last year, it seemed that Apple and other technology companies had won the public relations battle.\n\nThe attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, however, changed the government's calculation. Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two people suspected of killing 14 people, left behind an iPhone 5c -- a locked one. The F.B.I. has not been able to get access to any data on it.\n\nFor the administration, it was perhaps the perfect test case, one that put Apple on the side of keeping secrets for a terrorist.\n\nMr. Farook's phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep. It is encrypted with an algorithm the company says it cannot break. The F.B.I. wants to write a computer program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.\n\nBut Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.'s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.\n\nThere is little middle ground between the positions of the Justice Department and Apple, and Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, did not back down. He issued a sharply worded statement on Wednesday, saying he planned to fight the order. He said the Obama administration was not only creating a dangerous precedent but was demanding the creation of a dangerous tool -- a skeleton key that could be used by hackers and totalitarian governments.\n\n\"Once the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\" Mr. Cook said. \"The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\"", "Taiwan has witnessed two transfers of political power, and both times there has been an almost imperceptible appeal for \"transitional justice.\" However, there are many people in Taiwan who have little idea of what that term means, and have less interest in finding out.\n\nIt is not an appeal you usually hear when political parties hand over the reins of government in other nations: It is only heard in nations where a totalitarian regime has been replaced.\n\nIn its most extreme form, transitional justice resorts to revolution. In the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917, members of the monarchy and aristocracy were either executed or exiled. The communist revolution in China saw landlords throughout the country called to account. Much blood was shed in these events but, to those whisked up into the revolutions, this was all a form of transitional justice.\n\nAfter World War II, those that had conspired toward, instigated or participated in the invasion of other countries were prosecuted as war criminals. Those guilty of serious crimes were sentenced to death, while those convicted of lesser crimes were purged and banned from participating in politics.\n\nWhen West Germany and East Germany were reunified, government officials, academics, writers and artists who had colluded with the communist regime in East Germany were purged. They were not punished, but they lost their social standing. This was how transitional justice was achieved.\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War, when the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) retreated to Taiwan, Taiwanese were subjected to one-party totalitarian rule and many horrors, including the 228 Incident. People who opposed the KMT's policy of \"retaking the mainland\" and \"unifying China,\" or who pushed for democracy, freedom and human rights were arrested, imprisoned or otherwise done away with. They were made to \"disappear.\"\n\nIt is unconscionable that the KMT -- after having its national policy exposed as horribly flawed -- was able to do an about face as if nothing had happened and cozy up to the Chinese Communist Party, paving the way for the annexation of Taiwan. Have these former rulers, who formulated and long pursued a flawed policy; who misled the nation and the people living in it; and who slayed innocent civilians in the process, ever shown the tiniest bit of remorse? Have they uttered a single phrase by way of apology? Has the party done anything to atone for its past sins? No, no, and in all cases, no.\n\nThere is no shortage of candidates for serious punishment in this nation, although perhaps executions and exile orders can be dispensed for now.\n\nThe perpetrators of these past crimes have long lived the good life, staying well beyond the arm of the law. All the while, they have been trying to blind the public with slogans such as \"forget past enmities, we are all in this together,\" persuading Taiwanese to forget that forgiveness and reconciliation are the exclusive rights of the wronged, as they occupied the top of Taiwan's socio-economic pile. This being the case, people have no idea how to even start looking for transitional justice.\n\nDemocracy elsewhere is made of pure and refined stuff. Taiwan's is rough, spurious and contaminated. It is a shame for ordinary Taiwanese that transitional justice is always something on the horizon, something the public does not feel justified in reaching out for. Instead, most Taiwanese merely sigh and try to convince themselves that a more robust democracy is something they need to wait patiently for.", "Cedric de Leon, Manali Desai, and Cihan Tu\u011fal, editors, Building Blocs: How Parties Organize Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2015.\n\nJadaliyya (J): What made you put together this book?\n\nCihan Tu\u011fal (CT): Why did \"moderate\" Islamists fail so miserably throughout the Arab Spring? Why did the Turkish Islamists first stumble, but then re-emerge even more powerful (even if, in the way, they dropped their \"moderation\")? Our edited volume allows us to answer these questions by drawing attention to political creativity. The book includes analyses of politics in several countries and in different eras. Here I will focus on the overall theoretical claims, as well as what they imply for Islamist success.\n\nWe started this project with the following question: What scientific tools do we have in our toolkit to make sense of political creativity? And the answer was: Not much! We tend to see politics as a dirty business. For conservatives, politicians are people who meddle in good family and community life. For liberals, they are the ones who distort the markets. For radicals, they are the usurpers of bottom-up, popular energy and power. Families, markets, peoples are natural; politics are artificial. Good politicians, if there are any, are those who do not intervene in these natural processes and entities, but simply reflect them. They might even have an active role: fighting those who fight these \"natural\"s.\n\nIn this book, we develop an entirely different angle. Certain kinds of political activity construct these entities and processes; others naturalize them. Politics as usual (which we call \"institutional politics\") perpetuates them with little modifications.\n\nJ: How does this book differ from other attempts to think about the role of political parties in shaping the social order?\n\nCT: I will start by shortly summarizing how scholars usually perceive two parties we take as primary examples of integral politics: the Bolshevik Party and the Turkish Justice and Development Party (henceforth the JDP). I focus especially on these two parties in order to show how integral orientations can be found in both ends of the political spectrum. In the social sciences, Theda Skocpol's analysis of the Russian Revolution constitutes a major statement on how political leaders \"steal\" people's will. Actually, Skocpol (a prominent Harvard sociologist and political scientist) has developed to perfection an argument that has been in the making since Weber and Michels: the revolution had spontaneously happened; the Bolsheviks manipulated it to build a one-party state. Revolutionary parties, then, are surreptitious state-builders in \"insurrectionary\" clothing. The Bolshevik Party is the \"bad party\" par excellence of mainstream scholarship.\n\nSocial scientists also have a \"good party.\" Up until 2011-13, scholars hailed the Turkish JDP as the model democratic party. While some of these scholars had personal and/or ideological issues with conservatism and neoliberalism, they held that the party embodied the will of millions of conservative and business-oriented Turks. The religiosity and market-orientation of these citizens were built within civil society. Based on this anti-political stance, the most prominent liberal, leftist, and conservative academics (and journalists) supported the JDP.\n\nOur book, by contrast, shows that the JDP was the most Bolshevik-like formation the Turks ever had -- not in terms of the content of \"ideology,\" but in terms of how ideology is constructed, popularized, and put into practice.\n\nJ: What particular topics, issues, and literatures does the book address?\n\nCT: One central concept in our book is the \"integral party,\" a term that allows us to underline the similarities between these two apparently dissimilar political formations. The integral party brings contradictory demands and disparate constituencies under a single roof, and also reshapes their demands and interests in this process of \"articulation.\" We demonstrate that what really differentiates the JDP and similar parties from the Bolsheviks is not their reflection of an already constituted popular will, but rather their more expansive, more sustained, deeper, and more modern (or perhaps post-modern) Bolshevism -- what we could call \"Leninism under democratic [or semi-democratic] conditions.\"\n\nThe book provides similar examples of integral parties, ranging from the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Canadian Co-operative Commonwealth Federation-New Democratic Party (CCF-NDP), and the (American) Republican Party during the 1850s. We also look at \"disarticulation\" in contexts where no integral parties emerge, such as recent Indonesia. In the Islamic context, what renders the Turkish JDP so special is not its much more democratic version of religion (as its liberal and Western supporters once believed). The JDP is politically superior to other Islamists, we argue, because it was able to integrate and mobilize social groups entirely at odds with its agenda. We seek to demonstrate this through a sustained and theory-driven comparison with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the father of all modern Islamic movements.\n\nTo return to the Bolshevik case in light of the Egyptian one, we point out that state collapse, the main factor in the Skocpolian explanation, is necessary but not sufficient. Moreover, it is not the independent factor that institutionalists hold it to be. In many cases, including the Russian one, an integral party precipitates state collapse through mass mobilization, electoral campaigns, strikes, terrorism, and/or other means. There would be no total state collapse, and therefore no October Revolution, were it not for successful anti-war insurgency throughout the summer of 1917. The February Revolution would probably go down in history as a more extended version of the 1905 revolutionary failure.\n\nSimilarly, the incompleteness of state collapse in Egypt (between 2011 and 2013) was at least partially due to the absence of an integral party. Had the Muslim Brotherhood been as astute in its integralism as the JDP, it could have mobilized the liberals and leftists against the security apparatus, instead of fighting against them and clumsily cooperating with their ultimate butchers. The Brotherhood's unwillingness to go the JDP way, however, was not the result of an overnight decision: integralness, the capacity to articulate, is cultivated through decades, as our analyses of several cases show. Two key paragraphs from our Introduction (excerpted at the end of this piece) get to the heart of our other and related central concept, \"political articulation.\"\n\nIn our extended dialogue with the social sciences (mostly sociology and political science), we have integrated a lot of insights from the humanities. Articulation is a concept that originated in psychoanalysis. It was then developed further by philosophers. Political theorists, especially Ernesto Laclau, gave it definitive contours in the 2000s. But this was political theory of a certain kind, which mostly faced the humanities (and was deeply fused by linguistics). This conceptual development disabled any sustained social scientific use. Furthermore, it diverted attention away from institutions. We, by contrast, situate ourselves at the interface of the state- and institution-centered turn in the social sciences and this linguistic turn in the humanities. We study articulation in a quite different way when compared to Laclau and his students. We have many theoretical and methodological differences from Laclau and other theorists, which we discuss in the book (and we will need to discuss more in the future). What I would like to highlight here is one of these differences with substantive implications: our focus on the \"means of articulation.\"\n\nOrganizational histories and the making of professional party cadres and leaders is the missing mechanism in Laclau. An integral organization becomes successful when it cultivates cadres and leaders who (gradually) become experts in the manipulation of symbols, infiltration of civil society, and the uses of state power. Politicians with high \"suturing\"[1] capacity are those who can successfully wield the means of articulation (a list of which is provided at the end of this piece) and put them to integral use. Analysis should therefore unpack the ensemble of structures that favor or prevent the gradual making of such experts. In other words, political theorists' discourse analysis must be supplemented by institutional and structural political sociology.\n\nJ: Does your book shed light on any post-publication developments?\n\nCT: The recent election victory of the Turkish JDP (on 1 November 2015) is a very good example of how one of the means of articulation (war-making) operates under structural pressures (and also further shapes those structures -- see another excerpt below for more details). It was not predictable beforehand (and actually nobody, including the government itself, predicted) how successful the JDP's exceptional warmongering in summer 2015 would be: it could have backfired. Articulation (in this case, re-articulation) is a radically contingent game. Ultimately, the party increased its votes from forty-two percent in June 2015 to forty-nine percent in November 2015 -- in the span of just four and a half months. Not only re-initiating the Kurdish-Turkish war, but also threatening the rest of the population by a war that would spread to western Turkey, the party projected strength. As a result, Turkish nationalists and some Kurdish conservatives quit their parties and voted for the JDP. The Turkish nationalist base had signaled its readiness for a longer-lasting shift by joining the establishment and spread of \"Ottoman Hearths\" -- mass mobilizing associations modeled after the now ineffective \"Idealist Hearths\" (and their offshoots), far-right nationalist associations used to combat minorities, strikes, and leftists. Ottoman Hearth activists (and figures linked to them) burned (leftist-Kurdish nationalist) HDP buildings; physically attacked opposition activists and journalists; and participated in other repressive mass mobilization. It is too early to tell whether the re-articulation of Islamism and far-right nationalism will be as hegemonic as the JDP's previous articulation, but Angela Merkel's recent approval of the party's new path signals that Western powers will not be as unwelcoming as liberals thought they would be.\n\nThe JDP's moves also demonstrate how articulation and disarticulation can go hand in hand. Ever since the Gezi Revolt in June 2013, the party has been losing its liberal supporters. It has also been turning to more coercion in its dealing with its rivals. However, rather than simply disintegrating (as its erstwhile allies, the liberals, expected), the party has re-fashioned its means of articulation to hegemonize new constituencies. War has enabled the JDP to not only mobilize Turkish nationalists, but also bring back into the fold conservative Kurds, who seem to have voted out of the fear of an all-out repression of Kurds (after the model of 1993-1995, when the Turkish state forcibly removed millions from their villages and towns). Conservative Kurds might also be thinking that the ongoing reconfiguration would re-define liberals and leftists as the common enemy of Turks and Kurds.\n\nIt should not be ignored that the quality of the articulated elements and actors matter too. The JDP's Islamist-liberal-G\u00fclenist bloc had more capacity to put people to sleep. Its new, nationalist-Islamist bloc imposes silence through fear, relatively speaking. In this process, the conservative center-right population in Turkey has gone through a major cultural transformation: under normal circumstances, we would expect conservatives to (seek stability and therefore) punish adventurers. Instead, they rewarded the most war-oriented, destabilizing party in Turkey. In a nutshell, conservatives decided that for everything to stay the same, the most destabilizing means should be used.\n\nThe quality of the articulated elements matter not only for these primary concerns of political science (instability, war), but also for our main concern: the existence and capacity of the integral party itself. The sophisticated (but weak-willed) liberals had allowed the JDP to dance with the West and the secular bourgeoisie (and clothe even its repressive moves in democratic garb); the enthusiastic, energetic, and far more numerous right-wing nationalists, by contrast, are pushing the JDP to resort to force more and more. In the meantime, politics start to revolve around the person of Erdo\u011fan. For instance, the Islamists no longer fight on issues related to theology or policy; they rather quibble over who has betrayed the person and family of Erdo\u011fan. Islamist claims to power are now less based on ideology or interests, and more on one's relationships with \"the family.\"\n\nThe electoral shuffling of the last two years in Turkey seem to indicate that the JDP has purged and/or lost the liberals (as well as the more liberal of the conservatives), but, in turn, gained the nationalist right to its ranks. Nevertheless, unlike political scientists, we refuse to read too much into these election-time rationales. These voter shifts are significant for us in so far as they are embedded in other processes that signal the formation of new blocs (such as the establishment of the Ottoman Hearths in the Turkish case). We still have to see whether half of the population will keep on following the ruling party as it gets more adventurist. Here, the actions of its opponents matter as much.\n\nJ: Who do you hope will read this book, and what sort of impact would you like it to have?\n\nCT: We had two audiences in mind when writing this book. This is first and foremost a scholarly book, which not only announces the emergence of a new school of thought, but also a research agenda based on that school. It therefore defines certain empirical gaps in our knowledge and calls for further research to fill them, thereby combining theoretical work with \"normal,\" empirical social science.\n\nFor instance, the edited volume calls for a study of how and why integral parties emerge. What kind of historical formations and crises make this emergence more likely? Can institutional parties evolve into integral parties? When do we see movement in the reverse direction?\n\nWe only have outdated tools to analyze how and why integral parties degenerate into institutional or even neo-patrimonial parties. This gap in our theorization also has practical implications, and this is where our second intended audience comes in.\n\nThe most politicized countries of the world today seem to be caught between spells of intense mobilization, followed by abrupt pacification (or worse, popular endorsement of Bonopartisms, as in secular and Salafi consent for Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi). We point out that \"integral parties\" could stabilize these situations and still uphold citizen participation (but they could also breed fascistization, as we saw in post-2013 Turkey). A better-informed public could fight both Bonopartist and fascist routes more effectively.\n\nFor the broader public, therefore, we hope that the book will highlight the urgent need to build twenty-first century Leninisms. When integral parties degenerate, not only scholars, but also the broader educated public, recoils to either \"iron law of oligarchy\"-type arguments (as in the case of the Bolsheviks) or culturalist positions (as in the case of the Turkish JDP). Bolshevism's production of Stalinism is taken as an outcome of inevitable bureaucratization (\"even when revolutionaries come to power, they will behave like regular politicians,\" the conventional wisdom goes) and the JDP's culmination in Erdo\u011fan-centered neo-patrimonialism is believed to result from (guess what!) Turkish culture. The resulting mood demotivates political participation and (rather than undermining politics as such) paves the way for less transparent modes of domination. In other words, avoiding political articulation would not result in freedom from Bolshevism or post-Bolshevism (of either the left or the right), but in surrender either to the post-Bolshevism of one's enemies or to the (globally) emergent neo-medieval forms of power. The danger is not simply the further entrenchment of formations such as ISIS and/or of the JDP's intensifying fascistic neo-patrimonialism, but a race to the bottom among other Islamist organizations to approximate these forms of power as best as they can. We are, therefore, desperately in need of novel political theoretizations that would allow us to conceptualize how integral parties could be sustained and what mechanisms and circumstances lead them to degenerate.\n\nIn our book, we have started to provide empirical answers to the programmatic and practical questions posed above. As data and analyses accumulate, we also hope to reach some theoretical generalizations. In short, while our edited volume has theorized the basics of political articulation, much conceptual, empirical, and practical work remains to be done.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Isaac Martin, one of our critics, has suggested that \"welding\" could be a better metaphor to capture what we are describing, in that the articulated elements also metamorphose in the process of articulation. While Martin correctly points out the limits of the \"suturing\" metaphor, the problem with \"welding\" would be the implication that the resulting amalgam is as hard as iron. As our multiple examples of disarticulation and re-articulation demonstrate, this is far from true. Articulation is a flexible process that stands somewhere between welding, suturing, and (as our contributor Barry Eidlin remarked) the putting together of Lego pieces.\n\nExcerpts from Building Blocs: How Parties Organize Society\n\nFrom \"Introduction: Political Articulation: The Structured Creativity of Parties\"\n\nWe define political articulation as the process by which parties \"suture\" together coherent blocs and cleavages from a disparate set of constituencies and individuals, who, even by virtue of sharing circumstances, may not necessarily share the same political identity. Articulation is both a process and a mechanism of bringing together the constituents of the social through specific tools that we call the \"means of articulation.\" The creative potential of parties is crucial to understanding the political articulation approach, for though parties have many tools at their disposal, these tools have to prompt individuals to \"nominate\" themselves as members of social groups. Party politics is thus more than just a chess game or, in journalistic parlance, a matter of arithmetic; to succeed at articulation, target constituents must identify, say, as workers and therefore socialist, as Muslims and therefore Islamist, or as ethnic Russians and therefore nationalist. There is nothing automatic about this process of self-identification or about the process by which self-identification builds to bloc or cleavage formation.\n\nSeen from this angle, political activity is not exclusively the drafting of policies and their implementation (factors which the state formation literature focuses on, through concepts such as \"state capacity\" and \"infrastructural power\"). Nor is it just about securing votes and public support (that is, legitimate representation, which is the core focus of voting behavior scholars and some cultural analysts of the state). Rather, it is first and foremost the articulation of isolated demands and sectors into one's camp as well as the disarticulation of certain demands and sectors from the rival camp and their re-articulation into one's own camp.\n\n...\n\nThe \"means of articulation\" that parties employ in their projects consist of state and nonstate mechanisms that they uniquely possess to politicize social differences that might not otherwise be politically salient. These include rhetoric; public policy; official state and paramilitary violence; co-optation...; the provision of social services and infrastructure...; constitutional rules...; peace commissions and other civic groups...; and electoral mobilization, including the recruitment (and possibly transformation) of powerful civil society organizations.\"\n\n...\n\nExercising the war-making prerogative of the state may allow a governing party to build blocs by stoking the fires of nationalism or ethnic pride, for instance, while stigmatizing the opponents of war as weaklings, traitors, or apathetic minorities. Using war as a means of articulation carries risks, however. A war that goes badly, is costly, and/or drags on may invite international sanctions and thereby shrink the aforementioned economic means of articulation that a party may use to maintain its governing bloc. Such a war could also discredit the government's nationalist rhetoric as impetuous and deleterious to the country's international reputation.\n\n[Excerpted from Building Blocs: How Parties Organize Society, edited by Cedric de Leon, Manali Desai, and Cihan Tu\u011fal, by permission of the editors. \u00a9 2015 by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Jr. University.

One teacher most of all: Mr Salah Lamrani has learned what it costs to speak \"en Fran\u00e7ais.\"\n\nFrance continues to project this aura of democratic fortitude; lecturing the world on how countries should behave and govern themselves, due to some colorfully narrated history as the \"R\u00e9publique\" representing Freedom, Equality and Fraternity, when in fact it's on course to become the very despot it warns against.\n\nA police state hiding behind the veneer of Western democratic sainthood, France is in fact a racist and intolerant state vying for complete political, social, economic and intellectual control ... Of course one cannot ignore the religious sphere. In the land of Voltaire, one should not overtly say God; only deny his existence, worshiping instead at the altar of secularism.\n\nWhere France once stood for Freedom, its state now wrestles with selective freedoms. Paris is actively looking to thin out the rights civilians are still allowed to practice. How beautiful the French Marianne today! How strong the 5th Republic ...\n\nWhat is left to say of a state which persecutes its intellectuals and teachers? What is left to say of a system which promotes witch-hunting and fear-mongering, targeting those with views that differ from the Establishment's?\n\nIsn't intellectual diktat the very character of a dictatorship? Has France lost all sense of republican pride and identity that it stooped to policing its most dedicated teachers in the name of politica conformity?\n\nIn February 2016, Professor Salah Lamrani, a French Literature Middle School tenured teacher in the Paris popular suburb of Seine Saint Denis was unjustly, and unlawfully suspended for four months following phantasmagorical claims he espoused radical tendencies.\n\nMr Lamrani, whose professional file remains without so much as a blemish, exemplifies France's descent into ultra-national fascism - this new sense that France needs to stand puritan and absolute in the declaration of its values - even if it means ... actually, especially if it means, silencing those who still dare live pluralism as a God given right.\n\nIt all began with one teacher's love for writing and a passion for the French language. A tradition which gifted the world of the likes of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emile Zola and Baudelaire has risen today a tyrant, surpressing thoughts, words and philosophies, wielding fear and repression to better bully so-called potential dissidents into not just silence but intellectual uniformity.\n\nA free thinker, Mr lamrani came to clash with a narrow-minded head-teacher, both a product and a tool of the \"system\", for he dared express certain opinions on such matters as politics and foreign policy on his personal blog, outside the sphere of control his office could have ever claimed to exert upon his person. Still, he was castigated.\n\nLamrani openly challenged France's state of emergency. He dared suggest Russia and Iran were in fact abiding by the spirit of international law in their resistance against Daesh in Syria. An opinion that saw him likened to those rag-tags mercenaries whose blades have inspired only disgust and fear.\n\nIn an interview I conducted with him on February 14, Mr Lamrani explained how his troubles stemmed from the implacable authoritarianism his school's most senior figureheads demonstrated against his person.\n\nI was suspended without any investigation and in spite of my formal complaint for moral harassment and slander due to my school authoritarian management - who didn't like my Union and blogger activities, and who accused me publicly of being a dangerous terrorist.\n\nIn times such as ours such claims should not be taken lightly as they can result in dramatic repercussions - not the least Mr Lamrani's personal safety, and freedom.\n\nMr Lamrani's \"crimes\" were that he denounced state repression, while proclaiming personal political truths on a platform which was his own, outside school hours, and without any effect on his work as a teacher.\n\nBecause one head-teacher, Mrs Khadidja Bot, imagined herself a \"keeper\" of the establishment, a self-appointed tyrant of the national education complex, one man's life and future now stand in jeopardy. Because, she, a person of authority, chose to slander and label, to better assert her \"power\", a valuable teacher has been shunned by his community and vilified by his colleagues. Without so much as a shred of evidence, without the authorities ever bothering to open an inquiry into his alleged \"radicalism\", one man was stripped of his professional dignity.\n\nThis is France's state of emergency! How it treats its nationals, how it rewards free-thinking and intellectualism. France has many lessons to teach the world when it comes to totalitarianism.\n\nBut if Mr Lamrani has lost a battle against the Establishment, he is not admitting defeat. In fact, he has vowed to expose the very system which has claimed his freedom and attempted to silence his voice, so that others will learn to speak unhindered.\n\nIt was Jean Jaures who said:\n\nAll of us forget that before everything else, we are men, ephemeral beings lost in the immense universe, so full of terrors. We are inclined to neglect the search for the real meaning of life, to ignore the real goals - serenity of the spirit and sublimity of the heart ... To reach them - that is the revolution.\n\n-\n\nComment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page\n\nBecome a Member of Global Research", "16 years ago Sega's Jet Set Radio was the most stunning game in the world, its solid colors and stark black lines rendering Tokyo as a vibrant cartoon playground in the midst of a totalitarian crackdown.

This is a done deal. There are no surprises awaiting us.\n\nThe powers-that-be have already rigged the system.\n\nThey--the corporations, the military industrial complex, the surveillance state, the monied elite, etc.--will not allow anyone to be appointed to the Supreme Court who will dial back the police state. They will not tolerate anyone who will undermine their policies, threaten their profit margins, or overturn their apple cart.\n\nScalia's replacement will be safe (i.e., palatable enough to withstand Congress' partisan wrangling), reliable and most important of all, an extension of the American police state.\n\nWith the old order dying off or advancing into old age rapidly, we've arrived at a pivotal point in the makeup of the Supreme Court. With every vacant seat on the Court and in key judgeships around the country, we are witnessing a transformation of the courts into pallid, legalistic bureaucracies governed by a new breed of judges who have been careful to refrain from saying, doing or writing anything that might compromise their future ambitions.\n\nToday, the judges most likely to get appointed today are well-heeled, well-educated (all of them attended either Yale or Harvard law schools) blank slates who have traveled a well-worn path from an elite law school to a prestigious judicial clerkship and then a pivotal federal judgeship.\n\nIn other words, it really doesn't matter whether a Republican or Democratic president appoints the next Supreme Court justice, because they will all look alike (in terms of their educational and professional background) and sound alike (they are primarily advocates for the government).\n\nGiven the turbulence of our age, with its police overreach, military training drills on American soil, domestic surveillance, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, wrongful convictions, and corporate corruption, the need for a guardian of the people's rights has never been greater.\n\nUnfortunately, as I document in Battlefield America: The War on the American People, what we have been saddled with instead are government courts dominated by technicians and statists who march in lockstep with the American police state.\n\nThis is true at all levels of the judiciary.\n\nThus, while what the nation needs is a constitutionalist, what we will get is a technician.\n\nIt's an important distinction.\n\nA legal constitutionalist believes that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law (the Constitution) and strives to hold the government accountable to abiding by the Constitution. A judge of this order will uphold the rights of the citizenry in the face of government abuses.\n\nA legal technician, on the other hand, is an arbitrator of the government's plethora of laws whose priority is maintaining order and preserving government power. As such, these judicial technicians are deferential to authority, whether government or business, and focused on reconciling the massive number of laws handed down by the government.", "16 years ago Sega's Jet Set Radio was the most stunning game in the world, its solid colors and stark black lines rendering Tokyo as a vibrant cartoon playground in the midst of a totalitarian crackdown.

We have the arts to help us reflect on a higher purpose. And we have the arts to help us learn.\n\nShen Yun Performing Arts's opening night performance at the Kennedy Center Opera House on Feb. 16 included all of the above. Finance student Emerald Pollard thought it was \"spectacular, I was beyond ecstatic with everything.\"\n\nOn her third time watching New York-based Shen Yun, she brought along her boyfriend Kevin Green, an aspiring actor. For him, it was a deep learning experience.\n\n\"It's interesting to see the history and culture through a performance,\" he said.\n\nEach of the Shen Yun's individual songs or dances highlights some cherished value of traditional Chinese culture -- compassion, loyalty, kindness or bravery -- often by telling a story, sometimes through the singing of award-winning vocalists.\n\nIn the story \"A Steadfast Heart,\" these traditional values are demonstrated in the present day. The beliefs of an elderly couple helps them to overcome persecution in China, with divine help.\n\n\"[Falun Dafa] was a traditional religion and spiritual practice that was suppressed by the communist party in an attempt to maintain control, even though it really is just a practice of compassion and caring,\" Mr. Green explained.\n\nFounded in 1992, Falun Dafa is a spiritual meditation practice that teaches truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. But since 1999, the communist regime has been brutally persecuting the practice. Millions of Falun Dafa practitioners have been arrested, illegally detained, tortured, and even killed for their organs.\n\nMr. Green explained that this was because the totalitarian regime would fear a group that had so many members. In less than a decade since its inception, the number of people practicing Falun Dafa swelled to over 70 million mainly through just word of mouth.\n\nMr. Green appreciated the spiritual element of the traditional culture in the performance, bringing the East and the West together.\n\n\"I think that at the core of most cultures, everyone's goal is to get along and treat others in a way that they believe is good,\" he said. \"They want to treat each other well. I think that we're really not all that different and this shows that very well.\"\n\nMiss Pollard added that this performance showed family values. She got the sense of people coming together and supporting each other in their beliefs, even when those beliefs are attacked.\n\nFor thousands of years, the Chinese called their country the \"Divine Land\" (Shen Zhou) and the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism were the heart of the culture. It was believed that the arts were given to humankind as a way to bring some of the divine to earth.\n\nNew York-based Shen Yun seeks to revive the sense of divine inspiration through classical Chinese dance and music, after systematic political campaigns like the Cultural Revolution almost destroyed the traditional culture in China.\n\n\"I spent many many, many years going to different religions. I've been to services at synagogues, I've been to services at mosques, I've been to services at Christian churches because I wanted to learn,\" said Mr. Green. \"At the end of the day, the goal is the same.\"\n\n\"Everyone's goal is to get along and treat others in a way that they believe is, for lack of a better term, good,\" he said. And the performance was a prime example.\n\nNew York-based Shen Yun Performing Arts has four touring companies that perform simultaneously around the world.

No matter how crude oil prices have fallen, it is still the most important revenue earner for the country\", Chief Oyegun said.\n\nIn Chief Oyegun's company was Mr Dakuku Peterside, the defeated Rivers State APC governorship candidate, who seemed to use the meeting to incite the military and the Federal Government against the people of Rivers State.\n\nAmong the demands of Dakuku Peterside and the Rivers State APC was the purge of alleged sympathizers \"of the immediate-past federal government administration in the leadership of security agencies, especially in the Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps\".\n\nThis absolutist politics of the APC is not only a direct threat to democracy in Nigeria, but seems to be a manifesto for the open politicisation of the security forces of the country.\n\nExperts have warned that the constant deployment and redeployment of police commissioners and officers is undermining the security architecture in many states, including in Rivers State.\n\nDakuku Peterside's irresponsible call for a politically-motivated \"purge\" in the security forces will spell disaster for Nigeria.\n\nThe APC seems to be animated not by the beneficent purposes of political power, but by the depredations that power could inflict on the party's opponents.\n\nBut the APC is not working alone. The party is supported by a gaggle of surrogate lawyers, revisionist intellectuals, and even sections of the media, to suppress competing visions on how Nigeria should develop as a country.\n\nWe call on all Nigerians to work together to stop this fast-advancing totalitarianism of the APC.\n\nIn Rivers State, despite the threats and braggadocio of the APC, the people have made it clear that only their sovereign will prevail in the rerun legislative polls billed for March 2016.\n\nWe call on all Nigerians and the international community to challenge the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), and the APC Government of President Mohammadu Buhari to hold free, fair and conclusive rerun polls in Rivers State.\n\nDr Austin Tam-George is the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Rivers State.", "If the recent deluge of dystopian books, films and TV shows is anything to go by, it appears our cultural preoccupation with the end of the world is nowhere near slowing down. The Hunger Games went from selling millions of books to theatre tickets; The Walking Dead's consistently stellar ratings are showing no signs of fatigue; even books for adults like Emily St John Mandel's best-selling Station Eleven are being anointed with stamps of approval from lofty awards bodies.\n\nThe general feeling regarding dystopia's unflagging popularity is that these dark stories reflect our dark times. The literary canon is well-populated with allegorical hellscapes meant to warn readers about future moral threats. In classics like George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, Phillip K Dick's Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? common threads of fear arise: the rise of technological dependence, the dangers of paranoid totalitarianism, the loss or suppression of individuality.\n\nMore contemporary dystopian texts have reflected modern fears. There's Claire Vaye Watkins' ecological wasteland in Gold Fame Citrus, the economic apocalypse in Margaret Atwood's The Heart Goes Last, and a world ravaged by a 'Mega Flu' in Mandel's Station Eleven.\n\nIn Australia right now, our world is very dark. I am, of course, referring to the ongoing debate around Australia's asylum seeker policy: a draconian, human-rights-violating living nightmare that we Australians perpetrate against some of the most vulnerable humans on this planet, punishing their desire to escape pain and terror with imprisonment and obscurity that is tantamount to torture.\n\nEven the most skilled bad-news-avoiders can't possibly ignore the stories trickling out of Nauru - of unimaginable horror, of a \"hell\" at \"the end of the world\" complete with poor living conditions, water shortages, limited access to sanitary products for female refugees, numerous allegations of sexual assault, rape and other abuses perpetrated against the women, children and men on Nauru and Manus Island by fellow internees and centre staff.\n\nThis is disturbing -- not just because the real-time dystopia of our refugee crisis would fit comfortably in any blockbuster saga, but also because, in that timeless fable of ethical terror, we Australians wouldn't be the heroes - we would be the villains.\n\n-\n\nTo any avid readers or watchers of dystopian stories, the history of Australia's \"border protection\" policies will seem queasily familiar. It's a classic battle between the haves and the have-nots, led by a secretive government body. Details of Australia's offshore (and onshore) detention arrangements are closely guarded. Australian journalists are all but forbidden from gaining access to detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island, and staff and volunteers on the islands are legally bound to keep secret what they witness there, under pain of imprisonment.\n\nIn the last two weeks, the hashtag #LetThemStay has been a rallying cry for Australians concerned with the fate of 37 babies -- all born in Australia -- who, under a new High Court ruling, could be returned to detention on Nauru at any moment.\n\nThe slogan has been painted on signs, promoted on social media, incorporated in the desperate pleas of many Australians, from treasured artists to the Premier of Victoria, all calling on the federal government to have compassion for these refugees. In a now-infamous photo circulated online, a protestor's sign reads: \"I can't believe we even need to protest the torture of kids.\"\n\nEndangering children as an act of deterrence is a move the Australian Government shares with the affluent overlords of Panem's Capitol in The Hunger Games. In Collins' series, the Games are a collective punishment designed to control and torment the dispossessed districts, and to deter them from rebelling; they work by ripping children away from their parents and forcing them into a battle for survival.\n\nSimilarly, in Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer, an uprising from the dispossessed passengers at the tail-end of the train begins in part because the children of the tail-end passengers are being kidnapped and sent to the front of the train as labourers for the train's moneyed front passengers. And in Cormac McCarthy's The Road, perhaps the most desperate moment of the book involves the image of a baby roasting on a spit over a fire, and of cannibals gathering to eat it.\n\nIn these texts, the torture of children, in whatever form, is seen as the apex of evil; what \"good guys\", in their right minds, would sacrifice children for their own enduring comfort?\n\n-\n\nThese fictional dystopian nightmares are usually orchestrated by some totalitarian government body or shady scientific organisation: shadowy officials who are ruthless in their protection of their secrets, rule their underlings with regimental talent, and are generally tasked with the onerous job of quelling the masses. In Snowpiercer, Tilda Swinton, who plays the snivelling government minister Mason, delivers a spectacularly weird speech on the hierarchy of the train while a rebellious tail-end passenger is punished for questioning her authority.\n\nGrand speeches calling for \"order\" and pledging \"protection\" are common for villainous leaders in dystopian stories -- and also, seemingly, for defenders of the current detention regime in Australia.\n\nWhen Immigration Minister Peter Dutton appeared on the ABC's 7.30 last week, he was allowed a considerable platform to make one such a speech. Avoiding a great deal of the questions he was asked, Dutton peddled the Border Protection party line, one we've heard so often we know it by heart: \"Stop the boats\".\n\n\"Well I don't want a recommencement and all of the intelligence that I have available to me says that people smugglers are desperate to get back into business,\" Dutton said. \"They want to trade in this human misery. And I don't want to see people, including women and children, drown at sea as we saw when Labor lost control of our borders.\"\n\nFor good measure, Dutton mentioned \"deaths at sea\" and \"stop the boats\" a half dozen more times in his short interview. Although he was questioned on a variety of issues relating to asylum seeker policy, it seemed to him there was only one good answer.\n\nDutton's words echo those of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who, when he was questioned on the Human Rights Commission's report into the detention of children, bleated: \"The most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats.\"\n\nRhetoric, the life raft of any politician under fire, protects Dutton, Abbott and their ilk from giving direct answers to direct questions. What they're hiding are the real conditions on Nauru -- conditions that, according to a recently-published Essential Report measuring the public's perception of our offshore detention program, Australians have little knowledge of.\n\nLikewise, propaganda becomes an important tool for quelling disquiet. In The Hunger Games, when rumblings of an uprising led by Katniss reach the Capitol, President Snow releases insidious videos of a captured rebel denouncing Katniss and her rebellion. In Australia, when the rhetoric against asylum seekers became focused on \"stopping the boats\", the federal government released their own expensive advertisements. \"NO WAY,\" they claimed. \"They will not call Australia home.\"\n\nAnd those reportedly \"cruel\" and \"inhumane\" conditions on Nauru? They may as well be ripped straight from any dystopian landscape.\n\nIn John Marsden's Tomorrow series, in which Australia is invaded by an unidentified Asia-Pacific nation, Ellie Linton and her friends tremulously describe the feeling of seeing their loved ones locked behind a fence in their local fairground - packed in tight, badgered by guards.\n\nIn Charlotte Wood's Stella Prize-nominated The Natural Way of Things, in which a group of women are kidnapped, shorn and imprisoned in a kind of work camp, there are endless descriptions of the petty hell in which the novel's women are interred. They eat from filthy bowls and their water is rationed. They wear soiled clothes they are unable to wash. They have limited access appropriate medical care, and their guards harass and abuse them.\n\nThese conditions are meant to shock and appal readers; likewise, the conditions on Nauru are meant to scare off desperate asylum seekers. (Although owing to the government's secrecy there is little concrete evidence that this is an entirely effective strategy.)\n\nWith all the misery inherent to dystopian texts, there is always one river of hope, the \"good guys\" who stand up against censorship, injustice and cruelty: Katniss and her band of rebels in The Hunger Games; Curtis and his tail-end militia in Snowpiercer; fierce; determined prisoners in The Natural Way of Things.\n\nIn Australia, these heroes are the doctors and caregivers risking prosecution to expose details of internment on Nauru, or to protect their patients from certain harm in detention; they are the lawyers and advocates working at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. The \"good guys\" are the children on Nauru, who are brave enough to reach out to the Australian public via their harrowing Facebook page, Free the Children NAURU.\n\nIf they're the heroes, what does that make the rest of us?\n\n-\n\nThe fiercest trends in popular culture always reflect something interesting about the society that consumes them. The recent rise of female sexual trauma storylines in TV shows like Jessica Jones, for example, may be at least in part due to the developing discourse around our global rape epidemic. World-ending threats like climate change and nuclear proliferation may explain why we're so obsessed with dystopia's fictional accounts of the world post-apocalypse.\n\nBut as Australians, we should be looking deeper. These stories detail horrendous injustices that misguided masses perpetrate against vulnerable people; they feature paternalistic, censoring governments parroting claims of \"protection\" and \"for your own good\"; they imagine the vulnerable in foul conditions, endangered, oppressed and stripped of their dignity.\n\nIn Shirley Jackson's infamous 1948 New Yorker story 'The Lottery', Jackson isolated a piercing moral terror in post-WWII society: \"the capacity for ordinary citizens to do evil\"; something which allowed people to turn away from Nazi atrocities, or offer up their friends and neighbours to service the growing Red Scare. The story hit a nerve with readers who were understandably afraid of \"this ugly glimpse of their own faces in the mirror\".\n\nPerhaps we should all take a leaf out of the dystopian genre's book, and stand up against these obvious injustices perpetrated in our names.\n\n-\n\nMatilda Dixon-Smith is a freelance writer, editor and theatre-maker, and a card-carrying feminist. She also tweets from @mdixonsmith.", "The government should not be given free rein to drag this nation to new depths of idiocy and infamy.\n\nAt the risk of breaking the law, I wish to comment on something positively important: the government's commitment to retain university tuition rates - in spite of massive funding cuts - is a good assurance. The cuts bring about other detriments; that's another story. But I must stop remarking on the benefits of the government's assurance of not raising fees, since I have most definitely broken the law.\n\nAll because I have not obtained the Minister of Education's permission to praise him.\n\nI did not have time - nor the desire, I admit - to seek the Minster of Education's written consent to commend him. I hope he doesn't mind, even though he's fully empowered to take action against unsolicited, warrantless, free compliments.\n\nIf you think I am being ridiculous, you should read the Statutory Bodies (Discipline and Surcharge) Act 2000 (SBA).\n\nAs a public university staff, I fall under its jurisdiction. The Act allows for the government to restrict, preclude and punish our activity and expression. And this little known legislation packs a (potentially) massive punch. With reference to disciplinary action against staff, its scope and intent are terrifyingly paranoid and ridiculously restrictive, more than the well-known and notorious Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA).\n\nSection 18. 1 (a) of the SBA warns us that \"an officer shall not, either orally or in writing or in any other manner make any public statement that is detrimental to any policy, programme or decision of the statutory body or the Government on any issue\". Of course, this embodies the UMNO-BN spirit of intolerance toward dissent, freedom of thought and public accountability. It is a blanket ban; there is not even any provision for officers to seek permission to criticize the government. That would be asking too much. And just in case we are not sure how sweeping is the scope of prohibition, this Act makes things explicit: \"on any issue\".\n\nWe should not be surprised. Punishing statutory body employees for criticizing without prior approval is the hallmark of the authoritarian state we have long inhabited. Note that the Statutory Bodies (Surcharge and Discipline) Act was passed in 2000, under Tun Mahathir's watch.\n\nBut read on and it gets a bit surprising, very amusing, and downright hysterical. Section 18. 2 (a) prohibits making \"any comments on the advantages of any policy, programme or decision of the statutory body or the Government... unless the prior written permission, either generally or specifically, has first been obtained from the Minister.\" With this edict that we must seek permission to applaud, UMNO-BN grants itself veto power over ego-inflating activities. It cannot even relax a bit and leave us free to sing the government's praises. This is the stuff of totalitarian regimes, which we may be inclined to laugh off and briefly feel embarrassed about.\n\nBut we should be a bit outraged. The installation of such mechanisms of control and arbitrary power stifles academic freedom, constricts our breathing space. It may be a slow and intermittent squeeze, not necessarily a brutal and constant strangulation. How many times have we reckoned a certain law gives arbitrary power, but the state is unlikely to exercise it?\n\nWe did not expect the Sedition Act to be used against an academic for expressing his expert opinion - until Azmi Sharom's prosecution under this law. In times of mad desperation, obnoxious laws become attractive, obscure articles get summoned from the cold. The charges against Azmi have just been dropped. But a new climate of fear and conformity has been injected into our universities.\n\nHave we thought that students would only be harassed for making \"political\", partisan statements? Universiti Malaya has just subjected six students to disciplinary action for complaining about wifi quotas without the university's permission. Armed with the UUCA (it's still a menace), the university deemed them guilty and issued stern warnings. University policies on student welfare are untouchable.\n\nInterestingly, the Statutory Bodies (Discipline and Surcharge) Act has recently been invoked at the University of Malaya in a reminder for academics to be docile minions. The intent is pre-emptive, to urge self-censorship. Again, one might be tempted to think, unless academics say troublesome things, they should not get into trouble.\n\nBut saying anything can be trouble, when giving praise without permission is punishable.\n\nI am reminded of a Biro Tata Negara examination that I took, together with government scholars at a Kem Bina Negara a number of years ago. One particular question and its multiple choice answers are unforgettable. It asked, what is the worth of preserving our forest and natural heritage? Two of the options were: (a) conservation allows us to enjoy nature, (b) to provide bio-technology resources for Malaysia to exploit. The only correct answer is (b); (a) is plain wrong. Such is canned, dictated praise.\n\nWill the state start to wield the Statutory Bodies (Discipline and Surcharge) Act against free speech? Will it prohibit criticism of the government on any issue and inhibit the crucial role academics have in sharing our opinion? Will comments on the drawbacks - and advantages - of government policy be fettered? What if a professor publicly disagrees with the Attorney-General drowning the RM2.6 billion scandal, or remarks that 1MDB seems to have yielded advantages for Jho Low and Najib Razak? Will disciplinary action be taken?\n\nI fear that such spectres are less and less far-fetched. And that's a shame.\n\nThe government and its institutions are permitted to make themselves look silly and immature, but they should not be given free rein to drag this nation to new depths of idiocy and infamy.\n\nLee Hwok Aun is Senior Lecturer in the Department of Development Studies, University of Malaya.", "What are we to make of Stu Lindberg's letter \"Socialism is tyranny?\" There are quite a few generalizations about freedom and liberty and Socialism, all at a level of abstraction that makes it hard to know what he's getting at, other than that the Soviet Union was a very bad country that severely abused its people. I certainly agree with that. But the rest .\n\nIf \"freedom\" means only that the government leaves you alone, which seems to be Mr. Lindberg's definition, then you are, somehow, \"free\" when you sit in a hovel shared with 10 other people, too sick to do anything but wait for death. You are somehow \"free\" to accept an employer's offer of 15 cents an hour for a 60 hour week or go down the street to find another employer who offers 15 cents an hour for a 60 hour week. It's a definition of freedom that ignores most of the realities of life. It's a definition of freedom that, as Thomas Frank noted,\" helps conservatives pass off a patently pro-business political agenda as a noble bid for human freedom . a doctrine that owes its visibility to the obvious charms it holds for the wealthy and the powerful.\n\nMr. Lindberg seems to equate Socialism with the totalitarian regimes, like the Soviet Union, that crushed individual freedoms in the name of the state. That is not the form of Socialism that reigns in many European countries, nor the form that Bernie Sanders advocates. As Sanders has explained more times than should ever have been necessary, he believes in \"democratic socialism\" in which governments are democratically elected and, by approval of the majority, enact enough regulations to keep business interests from steamrolling the very \"individuals\" that Mr. Lindberg cares about.\n\nThe Bennington Banner welcomes letters to the editor.

Because today's pharma-bribed doctors do almost nothing that can't be done by a sophisticated drug vending machine owned and operated by the pharmaceutical industry. Modern doctors, in other words, are little more than robotic pill pimps who offer absolutely nothing to patients that can't be done more cheaply and efficiently by automated systems. (And believe me, Big Pharma can't wait to take human doctors out of the loop entirely. It's one less group of people they have to bribe...)\n\nBy turning \"medicine\" into a pill-pushing scheme for profit, Big Pharma, the FDA and the U.S. government have all taken the art out of healing, eliminating any value of having a human being engaged in the practice of real medicine. Now, it's all just symptom diagnosis and drug prescriptions. And that process can be easily handled by automated systems.\n\nIn fact, much of the so-called \"diagnosis\" of disease and the prescribing of pharmaceuticals can be accomplished by an INTELLIGENT TOILET!\n\nEvery time you urinate into the toilet, chemical sensors analyze biomarkers for \"disease\" (which means whatever the drug companies define as \"disease\" so they can sell you more drugs). The Intelligent Toilet compares your biomarkers to a database of disease markers that are approved by the corrupt, pharma-controlled government, then writes prescriptions for drugs that claim to \"treat\" those conditions.\n\nYour toilet -- which has been licensed as an M.D. by your state medical board -- then uploads your prescriptions to the nearest pharmacy, which dispenses your drugs while billing Obamacare to rake in the profits. The pharmacy automatically sends an order to the drug companies to refresh the pills at a 50,000% profit because the whole industry is run by Martin Shkreli douchebags. Everybody gets rich in the new \"sick care\" economy, right?\n\nMeanwhile, your COMPLIANCE with the drugs is also analyzed by your M.D. toilet, which looks for chemical markers in your urine to confirm you're consuming the drugs. If you don't comply with the drug prescription, you will have your government food stamps restricted or other government benefits reduced until you comply. Now, your toilet is not only your doctor... it's also your slave master.\n\nAll the humans who used to be actual doctors, meanwhile, are given jobs cleaning the toilets... or turned into soylent green to feed the hungry population of chemically obedient slave citizens whose only purpose is now to VOTE in elections, since nearly all their jobs have already been replaced by Google robots (that spy on everyone while carrying out all the menial labor jobs in society).\n\nThose humans who refuse to participate in this whole system will be hunted down by Google / DARPA Terminator robots or Pentagon kamikaze drones to eliminate them \"for the public good.\" Can't have \"anti-government\" people disrupting this health care system, can we?\n\nWelcome to totalitarian medicine which has already begun in California with SB 277 and the vaccine obedience laws. With medical kidnappings now taking place across America -- where hospitals kidnap children to make money by forcing them into toxic cancer treatments -- there's no limit to the horrors against humanity that will take place when Big Pharma meets AI robots and armed government drones.\n\nRemember, all the vaccine-pushing doctors across America have already established their belief that citizens should have no CHOICE in their medical interventions. If the state wants to force an intervention upon you or your child (vaccine, chemotherapy, SSRI drugs, etc.), you have no choice in the matter!\n\nEven the American Medical Association has utterly abandoned all principles of medical ethics, refusing to speak out against totalitarian medical interventions like SB 277 or forced chemotherapy on children whose parents are thrown in jail and charged with \"kidnapping\" their own children by removing them from malicious oncology clinics.\n\nWhat's especially noteworthy in all this is that compared to robots, humans should be bringing humanity to medicine via compassion, empathy and intuition combined with knowledge. Yet today's doctors abandon compassion and empathy, functioning as nothing more than biological robots working for Big Pharma which is precisely why they will soon be obsolete. (When you take the art out of medicine, it all collapses into the formulaic dispensing of high-profit medications and chemotherapy agents.)\n\nAll the doctors who are pushing pills today and thinking they're set for life with a cushy job and wealthy income are about to find out just how expendable they really are in the totalitarian medicine economy.\n\nWhat a typical doctor learns in six years of med school can be downloaded to your electronic toilet in ten seconds as a database. When there is no art in medicine, human doctors soon become obsolete. And when they are obsolete, the pharma-industrial complex will rapidly find a way to eliminate them from the system.", "China's recent decision to expand the \"allowance\" of children per family from one to two has in some quarters been mistaken for a softening of the regime toward human rights, in this case the right of families to have children. However, tender pro-family feelings have nothing to do with this action taken by the nation's rulers. Let's be clear about this: the Chinese government still operates on totalitarian principles, meaning it is a country whose governing class claims the right (and does not hesitate to put that right into practice) to control and regulate all aspects of the lives of its subjects. Perhaps it is becoming less correct to speak of China unqualifiedly as a communist country, given its enormous efforts in recent decades to promote an economy that to some degree operates along profit-making principles and tolerates substantial financial inequality to do so. At the same time, its recent economic successes have rested on essentially the slave labor of prisoners combined with low wages that, as prosperity causes living standards to creep up, are likely to rise enough to price China out of some of the wealthier nations' outsourcing of labor.", "China's recent decision to expand the \"allowance\" of children per family from one to two has in some quarters been mistaken for a softening of the regime toward human rights, in this case the right of families to have children.

It may read overly long and include some familiar material, but only the most thoroughly documented, compendious account could do justice to the Kochs' bizarre and Byzantine family history and the scale and scope of their influence.\n\nMayer begins with Fred Koch, the family patriarch. \"Oddly enough,\" she writes, \"the fiercely libertarian Koch family owed part of its fortune to two of history's most infamous dictators, Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler,\" for whose regimes Koch's company built oil refineries in the 1930s.\n\nLargely because of his experience in the Soviet Union, Fred Koch became a staunch anti-Communist and, in 1958, one of the 11 founding members of the John Birch Society. His son Charles did not fully commit himself to his father's political project until the mid-1970s, when, Mayer writes, Charles Koch \"began planning a movement that could sweep the country.\" His declared goal? Nothing less than destroying what he referred to as \"the prevalent statist paradigm.\"\n\nThe 1980 platform of the Libertarian Party, to which the Koch brothers provided financial support and on which David Koch ran for vice president, offered a preview of their anti-government zealotry. The Libertarians opposed federal income and capital gains taxes. They called for the repeal of campaign finance laws; they favored the abolition of Medicaid and Medicare and advocated the abolition of Social Security and the elimination of the Federal Election Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \"The platform was, in short,\" Mayer concludes, \"an effort to repeal virtually every major political reform passed during the 20th century.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, given the extremism of their views, which William F. Buckley Jr. characterized as \"Anarcho-Totalitarianism,\" the Libertarians polled less than 1 percent of the votes. Ronald Reagan was elected president.\n\nAs Mayer notes, the Kochs, instead of accepting the voters' verdict, chose to spend money changing the way Americans voted. \"During the next three decades,\" Mayer writes, \"they contributed well over $100 million, much of it undisclosed, to dozens of seemingly independent organizations aimed at advancing their radical ideas.\"\n\nWhen the Supreme Court in the 2010 Citizens United case permitted nonprofits to spend money on political campaigning, the Koch brothers funded their own political machine, which, in size, dollars and sophistication, rivaled that of the two major parties. Their success in the 2010 midterm election was remarkable, and, Mayer says, took the Democrats by surprise. Republicans picked up seats in the House and the Senate and 675 in state legislatures. \"As a consequence of their gains, Republicans now had four times as many districts to gerrymander as the Democrats\" and the legislative power to pass a series of laws suppressing the vote of those who might not support their agenda.\n\nThe Kochs, Mayer is careful to remind us, are only one of several fabulously wealthy families that have tried to move America to the right. Their outsize influence is a result not only of their outsize fortune - according to Forbes magazine, the brothers are the fifth and sixth wealthiest Americans, with a combined family income larger than that of Bill Gates - but also of their intellectual prowess and organizational skills. For more than a decade, they have organized donor summits to which they have invited like-minded billionaires, political consultants, media celebrities and elected officials. At these meetings, plans are made, issues chosen, money raised, donations pooled, spending coordinated for the next election cycles.\n\nThe Koch brothers and their allies insist, and no doubt believe, that their war on big government has been motivated by their commitment to the individual freedoms that government interferes with. Still, \"it was impossible not to notice,\" Mayer writes, \"that the political policies they embraced benefited their own bottom lines first and foremost. Lowering taxes and rolling back regulations, slashing the welfare state and obliterating the limits on campaign spending might or might not have helped others, but they most certainly strengthened the hand of extreme donors with extreme wealth.\"", "When President Barack Obama touches down in Cuba next month, the first sitting U.S. leader to visit in seven decades, he'll be greeted by some people thrilled to see a rekindling of ties between the island nation and its powerful neighbor to the north. But among the crowds will also be those angered by what they see as an undeserved legitimacy conferred on Cuba's communist government.\n\nIt's a short visit -- March 21-22 -- but Obama has promised to raise human-rights issues and other concerns with President Raul Castro.\n\nJorge Luis Garcia P\u00e9rez, a Cuban opposition leader better known as \"Antunez,\" calls the visit an \"insult.\"\n\n\"The visit of the leader of the most important nation in the world to the country with the longest-lived dictatorship of the hemisphere, indeed, represents a recognition and encouragement [to the Cuban government],\" said Garcia Perez, head of the Orlando Zapata Tamayo National Resistance Front.\n\nOthers agree, seeing the trip as undeserved.\n\n\"We consider it a mistake to give that opportunity to the Cuban government without a public, political compromise from the Castro totalitarian regime to move toward rule of law,\" said Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, a Cuban political dissident and winner of the European Union's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.\n\nBefore the visit was announced, Obama told Yahoo News that, were he to go to Cuba, \"part of the deal is that I get to talk to everybody.\"\n\nFari\u00f1as hopes \"that President Obama will stick to his word and meet with the non-violent opposition.\"\n\nSupporters of the visit say Obama has given every indication that he will.\n\n\"Obama has taken various steps, since 2009, which have benefited the Cuban people. I think the people are very thankful and they have admiration for Obama. ... I think it is positive,\" said Miriam Leiva, independent journalist and founder of Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, an opposition movement formed by wives and other female relatives of Cuban jailed dissidents.\n\nYet even within Damas de Blanco there is division.\n\nThe group's leader, Berta Soler, argues that nothing has changed in Cuba. On most Sundays, Damas de Blanco members march through the streets of Havana. And on most Sundays, they continue to suffer arrest and injury.\n\n\"President Obama, you will arrive in Cuba to deal with a dictator and a thief. Reconsider,\" Soler tweeted Thursday.\n\nIneffective visits?\n\nSince the announcement of restored ties in December 2014, Obama administration officials have been shuttling back and forth to the island, from the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs and the Secretary of Commerce to Secretary of State John Kerry, who re-opened the U.S. embassy in Havana.\n\nSome on the island think the trips have had no impact, arguing Washington has given too many concessions to the Castro government without asking for changes in return.\n\nIn interviews with VOA, residents of the island said human-rights problems -- including political persecution, lack of access to the Internet, food shortages and low wages -- persisted over the past year.\n\n\"I see it just as another visit,\" said Eduardo Cardet, coordinator of the Christian Liberation Movement from Holguin, a town nearly 700 kilometers east of Havana. \"He is maybe coming here to crown all this process, the idea that he has been selling: that the reestablishment of relations between the U.S. government and the Cuban people will definitively bring democracy to our country, which is something I don't agree with, of course,\"\n\nOthers are willing to see how things play out after Obama leaves.\n\n\"I'm in favor of a climate of understanding between two nations. ... if President Obama's visit will contribute to that, so be it,\" said Dagoberto Valdes, director of Convivencia, an independent Cuban magazine. \"Something very different would be if these [visits] all stay in photo opportunities and nothing improves for the Cuban people.\"\n\nEmbargo a priority\n\nThe Castro government has said again and again that relations can only be truly normalized when the U.S. embargo -- in place for more than 50 years -- is lifted.\n\nMany Cubans agree the embargo has to go.\n\n\"It is a very positive event that Obama will visit Cuba because that's who we reestablished relations with and everything is going according to plan, a little slow but we always have to stay optimistic,\" said Pedro Rodriguez, a resident of Havana.\n\nHe paused briefly, then added: \"The embargo has to end for the relations to actually be relations.\"\n\nFor some, the prospect of free trade has trumped other considerations.\n\n\"Everyone thinks that the embargo will be short lived,\" said Yusdel La O Marrero, a driver for tourists in Havana. \"Those who used to think of leaving the island, they're now reconsidering that decision.\"", "The government and the intelligence community, as well as its congressional backers, is trying to assert that its efforts to force Apple to break the security of the iPhone is all about security. National security. But what about your security? Here's Tim Cook's customer letter explaining why it was fighting the court order to break security in the iPhone:\n\nSmartphones, led by iPhone, have become an essential part of our lives. People use them to store an incredible amount of personal information, from our private conversations to our photos, our music, our notes, our calendars and contacts, our financial information and health data, even where we have been and where we are going.\n\nAll that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission. Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.\n\nCreating a backdoor into this phone, which is what the FBI is demanding Apple do, seems reasonable enough, right? It's just one phone, after all. Except it isn't.\n\nAuthorities have the phone in their lawful possession, and they only need help seeing what's on it in case it can tell them something about how the San Bernardino shooters operated. But the hacked software the court and the FBI wants Apple to provide would be general. It would work on any phone of the same model. It has to. [...]\n\nWhat the FBI wants to do would make us less secure, even though it's in the name of keeping us safe from harm. Powerful governments, democratic and totalitarian alike, want access to user data for both law enforcement and social control. We cannot build a backdoor that only works for a particular type of government, or only in the presence of a particular court order.\n\nEither everyone gets security or no one does. Either everyone gets access or no one does. The current case is about a single iPhone 5c, but the precedent it sets will apply to all smartphones, computers, cars and everything the Internet of Things promises.\n\nOnce this precedent is set, there isn't any turning back. Apple opens the iPhone for the U.S. government, and all the countries where iPhones are sold demand the same. And then they demand it for all the things that we trust to secure our personal information. Apple creates the vulnerability, and suddenly hackers everywhere have the keys to our lives. This doesn't end with this one phone. It's not about this one phone for the FBI -- it's about setting the precedent to force any and all manufacturers to break encryption on their devices, leaving all of us less secure in our daily lives.", "Hundreds of streets, squares and bridges across Poland could have their names changed in a new effort to \"de-communise\" the country and rid it of anything that could promote totalitarian systems.\n\nExperts estimate there are around 1,500 names across the country that could be changed in a new purge ushered in by a bill currently in the Polish parliament that could ban the promotion of totalitarian systems such as communism.\n\nPolish cities and towns ditched many of their more-blatant communist-inspired street names after the fall of the socialist bloc in 1989, but according to the ruling Law and Justice party too many names managed to survive.\n\n\"Poland has a huge backlog of names and most of the countries in our region have managed to cope with de-communisation,\" said Michal Dworczyk, a Law and Justice MP. \"It's unacceptable that there are still street names celebrating criminals.\"\n\nBut further de-communisation could stir up problems with neighbouring Russia. Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, a body charged with investigating communist-era crimes, has asked that the bill includes \"monuments of gratitude to the Red Army\".\n\nMoscow has already voiced its outrage over the dilapidated state of Soviet war memorials in Poland and the desire of some Polish towns to move statues honouring the Red Army away from central squares to less-obvious locations.\n\nSo the prospect of street names commemorating the exploits of the Red Army being removed could add to Moscow's ire and put further pressure on the fraught relations between Poland and Russia.\n\nThe legislation has also come under fire from the left of Polish politics. Left wing politicians have raised concerns that names honouring the memory of the country's wartime communist resistance could also face the chop.\n\nUnder the legislation local authorities will have up to two years to change the unwanted names.end", "E-siege.

By Friday, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center administrators declared a state of emergency, shutting down the radiation and oncology departments and diverting hundreds of patients to nearby hospitals. \"The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,\" hospital president and CEO Allen Stefanek said.

Turkish officials are blaming Syrian Kurdish militias for yesterday's suicide bombing in Ankara that killed 28 people. They vowed to strike back at the groups in both Iraq and Syria and launched an airstrike overnight against a Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) base in northern Iraq. The PKK has waged a long-running insurgency against Turkey in a bid for its own state. The YPG, another Kurdish group, is one of the Syrian militias backed by the United States in its fight against Islamic State (ISIS) fighters. Disagreement over the legitimacy of Kurdish groups has been an ongoing wrinkle in the otherwise tight alliance against ISIS. The Kurds deny any involvement in the Ankara attack, claiming Turkey is using it as an excuse to escalate the fighting in northern Syria.\n\nHistoric Havana visit. President Barack Obama will visit Cuba next month, the first U.S. president to set foot in the communist nation in 88 years. The president's visit is not unexpected after the announcement in 2014 that the United States and Cuba would re-establish diplomatic ties. Secretary of State John Kerry attended a ceremony last year to mark the official reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Havana. Two frontrunners in the Republican presidential field with ties to Cuba, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both slammed the president for his ongoing attempts to cozy up to the Castro regime. Rubio said if he were president, he would only visit a \"free\" Cuba. Cruz also criticized Obama for giving credibility to a totalitarian regime that represses its people.\n\nBig backers. Rubio picked up another major endorsement in South Carolina ahead of Saturday's primary. \"We say that every day is a great day in South Carolina,\" Gov. Nikki Haley said during an endorsement event Wednesday night. \"Ladies and gentlemen, if we elect Marco Rubio, every day will be a great day in America!\" Haley's endorsement is a big pickup for Rubio, who already has the support of two popular South Carolina GOP lawmakers, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy. An average of recent polls has Rubio virtually tied for second place in the Palmetto state with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Both candidates are polling at about 17 percent.\n\nBathroom bill. South Dakota's state Senate passed a bill this week that requires transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their biological sex. South Dakota will be the first state in the nation to have such a law if Gov. Dennis Daugaard signs it. Advocates say the bill protects the privacy of all students. Opponents, including the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice, have sided with transgender students. They say the bill violates Title IX, even though it includes a reasonable accommodations such as single-occupancy bathrooms.", "(NaturalNews) Before long, your pill-pushing doctor will be replaced by a pill-pushing AI toilet that's tag-teamed with a Terminator-style compliance android or drone.\n\nWhy?

Remember the huge campaign against Jerry Springer The Opera? We get offended by Richard Dawkins' every tweet (often missing the point that many of his communications are designed to elicit just that response). How about the absurd faux-outrage over Stabucks' plain red cups? Yep, we're good at being offended.\n\nIn wider society, the concept of offence is becoming more and more common. Again and again, and especially on university campuses, the possibility that one group of people might be offended by another group of people's opinions is being used to stifle free speech...\n\nWell over ten years after I left university there are some lectures that remain fresh in my mind. Probably aware that many of his students were half-awake when they arrived, my American History tutor would begin every lecture with a piece of music.\n\nOn the day we were studying the Bill of Rights, he pressed play on the ghetto blaster (I know, I know) and out came the sound of The Clash. The song, Know Your Rights, is a stinging satire on how rights enshrined in laws or constitutions can be overridden by those in power. \"You have the right to free speech,\" sings Joe Strummer, \"as long as you're not dumb enough to actually try it!\"\n\nSadly, in the UK (and the US), this song is more apposite than ever. Corporations and governments using tools such as the Lobbying Act to stifle criticism. Writers from across the political spectrum are now highlighting another worrying drift towards authoritarianism.\n\nUniversities, which are supposed to be bastions of freedom of expression, are at the vanguard of a chilling descent into a post-free speech world.\n\nThis was brought into sharp focus this week when the veteran gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was 'no-platformed' by a representative of the National Union of Students, accusing him of \"racism\" and \"transphobia.\" Tatchell has been not only a redoubtable campaigner for LGBT rights around the world for decades, but he has also championed the freedom of speech of Christians and others with whom he profoundly disagrees.\n\nHe has defended the rights of Christians to say things which deeply offend him as a gay man - because he realises that freedom of speech is the 'canary in the coal mine' of a free society. When freedom of speech is systematically threatened, we have got a real problem.\n\nIt's not an isolated case by any means. Political journalist Ian Dunt has catalogued just a few of the many attempts to stifle free speech in recent months: \"Oxford University cancelled a debate on abortion because protesters objected to the fact it was being held between two men; the Cambridge Union was asked (but refused) to withdraw its speaking invitation to Germaine Greer because of her views on transgender issues; officials at London Southbank took down a \"flying spaghetti monster\" poster because it might cause religious offence; UCL banned the Nietzsche Club after it put up posters saying \"equality is a false God\", and Dundee banned the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children from their freshers' fair.\"\n\nLet's be clear what's going on. A calamitous error is being made. People who are calling for bans on free expression have mistaken the airing of views which they find offensive or abhorrent as some kind of endorsement of those views by the university. This is clearly nonsense. But it's sinister nonsense.\n\nIt implies that only the views tolerated by a certain clique in charge of discerning who is to be allowed a 'platform' are the views that will prevail. This is the beginning of totalitarianism. If we want to live in a society where we are free to express ourselves and the government and big corporations cannot imprison us simply for our views, then those views have to be allowed to be aired - even if they cause offence.\n\nOffence has become the metric by which some university students define whether a view should be heard or not. This doubtless comes from good intentions - not wanting those who've suffered racisim, sexual assault or other persecution to be forced to re-live their ordeals. We have to take this concern seriously - and gratuitous offence should never be encouraged. However, there is no right not to be offended. As the atheist author Phillip Pullman said when told by a Christian that his book was offensive, \"No one has the right to live without being shocked. No one has the right to spend their life without being offended.\"\n\nWhen it comes to freedom of speech, we have to draw the line somewhere, though. That line for me is when advocating violence. That's why I'm comfortable with rape advocates, suicide bombing enthusiasts and far right extremists being denied a platform, and even banned from the UK altogether. There is no way people who directly threaten safety or even lives should be welcome on our shores.\n\nHowever, beyond those constraints, people must be allowed to air their views, or we're heading for big trouble. Without the freedom to express our ideas, even if they are offensive, then the freedom we claim we have is meaningless. Does this mean we should support the work of the anti-religious trolls of Charlie Hebdo? What about those publishers who've sought to reproduce images of Mohammed? Of course not. We shouldn't encourage behaviour which is going to cause hurt and pain. But should we ban these things? I'm afraid not.\n\nChristians should care about this topic deeply - not least because our sisters and brothers in many places around the world are systematically denied freedom of speech and religion. In places like North Korea, Pakistan and Eritrea, they are facing real persecution and real risk to their lives. However, here in the West, we don't face persecution - and maybe it's time for us to develop thicker skins and realise that from time to time, we're going to be offended, and that's the price we pay for living in a free society.\n\nIf someone says something offensive about us, or our faith, let's not seek to curtail freedom of speech. That's the tip of an iceberg we really don't want to see the rest of... Instead, let's seek a mature debate around the issues we care about - let's live up to our calling as citizens in a free society, rather than dwelling on the offence.\n\nIn Galatians 5, Paul talks about the \"offence of the cross.\" The Gospel we proclaim as Christians will, at times, be offensive. While we should never seek to offend and while the Gospel is also comforting Good News, we can never rid it of its power to offend. In this context, Christians must defend the right to speak freely and openly - even if those doing the speaking are offending us! Free speech is a two way street.\n\nGeorge Orwell said, \"At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed all right-thinking people will accept without question... Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.\" As ever, Orwell's foresight is remarkable. This is the risk we now face.\n\nAs well as maintaining a truly free society, there's another advantage to preventing a small cabal of thinkers deciding what is and isn't acceptable to talk about. The oxygen of publicity often helps to destroy the arguments of bigots and crackpots of all kinds.\n\nWhen fascist Nick Griffin appeared on BBC Question Time in 2009, protestors lined up outside. I wrote this about Griffin at the time, \"He's a repugnant human being with toxic views that will wreck this country if he ever gets a chance to put them into practice. But how do I know this? Because he's been given enough rope by TV documentaries and other media outlets to hang himself. If the only thing I knew of the BNP was their party political broadcasts I might think they were reasonable. So while I think a protest is a good idea, a protest which calls for the BBC not to have him on TV is nonsense. The demonstrators' line should be: \"we may not like what you say, but in the sort of society we want to live in, you're allowed to say it.\"\n\nSince that broadcast (and as a result of lots of dedicated local campaigning) Nick Griffin lost his seat in the European Parliament, The British National Party has folded and he has become a footnote in history. Because he was given free speech? Not entirely - but I suspect it played a role in his catastrophic fall in popularity.\n\nAs Heather Tomlinson wrote for Christian Today earlier this week we seem to be entering a worrying new period where people are being condemned for what they believe, rather than what they do. As Christians, we need to play our part in building a culture where robust disagreement can be managed well - and offence is rare, but tolerable. The alternative - a society without offence to some, but without freedom of speech for many, is a grim prospect indeed.", "President Obama has decided. He won't go to Antonin Scalia's funeral. But he will go to Cuba and meet Fidel.\n\nEvidently there are no advisers at the White House, or what few there might be have decided there is no point in arguing against this stark contrast, nothing to say to a guy who repeatedly claims he is the smartest man in the room.\n\nThese twin decisions tell us where President Obama's head is at, dredging up the antique phrasing of the hippie '60's.\n\nHe cannot bear to bestow the full honor of Presidential presence at the funeral of the most famous and influential conservative in the country, a Supreme Court Justice who dedicated his life to the idea that the founders got it right, and the Constitution should be followed as written, not as some might wish it were written.\n\nOn the other hand, he can't wait to jet off to Communist Cuba and meet Fidel Castro before he dies. Which could be any minute, by the way, and which would set up an even stranger contrast: President Obama attends the funeral of an America hating Communist dictator shortly after refusing to attend the funeral of the icon of liberty jurisprudence, Antonin Scalia.\n\nPresident Obama is anxious to heap the respect of a Presidential visit on a totalitarian socialist while piling an obvious Presidential snub on an icon of freedom.\n\nAnd don't even try to excuse him with \"scheduling conflicts.\" He not only has a pen and a phone, he has the world's best private jet, and a motorcade that can go anywhere anytime.\n\nThe President makes these choices on purpose. He doesn't try to hide their meaning.\n\nConsequently there is no reason the rest of us should ignore that meaning, so obvious it screams..", "Kansas lawmakers are making another attempt at repealing Common Core standards, a measure that could affect and possibly do away with Advanced Placement classes and International Baccalaureate programs.\n\nHouse Bill 2676 would compel Kansas school districts to develop new standards for reading, math, science and other subjects that would replace the Common Core-inspired Kansas College and Career Ready Standards that have been in place since 2010.\n\nThe bill passed out of the House Education Committee on Wednesday, shortly after committee members heard a presentation from Duke Pesta, a Wisconsin professor known for his outspoken opposition to Common Core.\n\nIt could be heard on the House floor as early as next week.\n\nBefore advancing the bill, the committee took its contents and stuffed them into Substitute House Bill 2292. The procedural move, known as a \"gut and go,\" speeds up the legislative process.\n\nThe measure - similar to one proposed last year - calls for AP, IB and similar courses and tests to be aligned with pre-Common Core Kansas standards. Educators say that directive would be difficult, if not impossible, because such courses are modeled on national or international frameworks.\n\nAccording to the bill's fiscal note, it would prohibit anything related to Common Core in Kansas classrooms and would require new standards for math and language arts and new assessments. The Kansas State Department of Education has estimated the development of new standards would take two years and cost $9 million.\n\n\"It would undo everything,\" said Judith Deedy, executive director of Game On for Kansas Schools, a statewide education advocacy group.\n\n\"You don't eliminate Kansas participation in AP and IB by saying you can't do anything that Kansas doesn't control. That's not fair to the kids. You can't just change curriculum overnight.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill were not immediately available for comment Thursday.\n\nDeedy's group and other opponents began mobilizing against the measure Wednesday evening, saying lawmakers \"pulled a legislative trick\" to pass it through committee and onto the House floor without a hearing.\n\nScott Rothschild, communications specialist for the Kansas Association of School Boards, attended Wednesday's committee meeting. He said Pesta, an English professor at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh who has traveled the country denouncing Common Core, spoke for more than an hour, at one point shouting and alleging that American public schools were modeled after totalitarian Prussia.\n\nThe meeting agenda said it would be an informational briefing on \"The History of Education.\"\n\nAfter Pesta's presentation, Rep. Ron Highland, R-Wamego, brought up the bill, which passed on a voice vote, Rothschild said. When some committee members complained that opponents weren't allowed to testify, Highland said testimony was provided last year during debate on a similar measure.", "From comedy to social satire to pathos, the viewers had plenty to choose from.\n\nWritten by Ashutosh Potdar, \"F-1/105\" presented by Aasakta Kalamanch, Pune, at Shri Ram Centre as part of Bharat Rang Mahotsav in New Delhi was lively, entertaining with a tinge of irony and satire. One the surface, the play appears to be simple and straightforward but as the narrative unfolds and moves towards the climax, various layers come to the fore, layers which are dark and parochial that makes human life miserable. It is a serious comment on forces in metropolitan cities that pose serious threat to individual freedom.\n\nThe action is set in a cooperative housing society. A couple owns a flat with the number F-1/105 and wants to renovate it. A worker enters the flat and interacts with the housewife, exchanging ideas about the kind of colour. The housewife opts for green colour. An innocent conversation between housewife and the painter about green colour involves the entire managing committee of the housing society, reflecting diabolically different opinions about green, questioning the owner's intentions, intimidating them. The simple worker, who hails from an unidentified place located somewhere in the north, is humiliated.\n\nApart from economy of dialogue, the physical movements reflect fine-tuning and an excellent example of ensemble acting. It is a multi-lingual - Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati and English - play to give an authentic atmosphere of metropolitan city where people from different regions live. Director Mohit Takalkar has created a metaphor that reflects a society threatened by totalitarian philosophy. The stage is designed imaginatively to re-enforce the intent of the play - the looming threat to individual freedom by forces of sectarian elements. Only two beanbags are placed on the stage which is used to mask performers who are not required to be part of the action at a specific situation and they come out on the stage to join the action.\n\nAnother play, \"Ila\", presented by The Patchworks Ensemble, Mumbai, jointly directed by Puja Sarup and Sheena Khalid at LTG Auditorium, the thematic idea of the play is drawn from the mythological character known as Ila. Her gender is forcefully changed from female to male to be the heir of mythological kingdom and by mysterious working of nature Ila regains her female gender. The mythological narrative is interpreted by contemporary directors as a comment on patriarchal society. But the play under review mainly focuses on the comic elements about the myth while setting the action in a Mumbai local train.\n\nThe slices of life of women are woven into a narrative that is cohesive, evoking laughter. In this process, the play reveals that the reserved compartment for ladies becomes a general compartment after 11 pm. During daytime ladies aggressively protect their right to have exclusive compartment for themselves. However, they do not mind the presence of male vendors in their compartment from whom they buy small items and snacks. This is the way to state comically that at a given point of time even the ladies compartment too changes gender.\n\nThe dialogue devised in the course of rehearsal by the entire ensemble reflects day-to-day life of women which are spiced with jokes. The choreography is marked by spontaneity which creates the illusion of female passengers travelling in a train compartment. In a way, the performers reflect joy of life. It is an attempt to look at mythological Ila from the comic angle by contemporary urban Indian women.\n\nPravin Kumar Gunjan's production of \"Gabarghichor\" presented by The Fact Art and Culture Society, Begusarai, Bihar, at Shri Ram Centre was aptly designed with the members of the chorus sitting on a raised platform upstage, playing an impressive array of folk instruments of Bihar. Music conveying a wide range of human emotions is the soul of the production. In terms of genre, the production could be described as an opera based on folk elements. The script of the production is written by legendary writer Bhikhari Thakur of Bihar. The dialogues are in Hindi, Bhojpuri and Magadhi. The focus of the play is on the suffering of a woman whose husband leaves from the village to city to earn a livelihood. The deserted lonely woman gives birth to a male child which is named Gabarghichor. When after years of separation the husband returns home and claims that the son belongs to him, the biological father asserts that Gabarghichor is his son while the mother claims that the boy is truly hers. Using the device of Bertolt Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle, the panchyat declare the son belongs to the mother. The dominant mood is one of pathos evoked by lamentations of a mother being robbed of her son and the agony of a boy born out of wedlock.\n\nThe performers display their acting as well as singing talents to captivate the audience.", "John W. Whitehead Attorney, President of The Rutherford Institute, and author of 'Battlefield America'\n\nThe untimely death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has predictably created a political firestorm over who gets to appoint the next U.S. Supreme Court justice, when, how, and where any judicial nominee will stand on the hot-button political issues of our day (same-sex marriage, Obamacare, immigration, the environment, and abortion).\n\nThis is yet another spectacle, not unlike the carnival-like antics of the presidential candidates, to create division, dissension and discord and distract the populace from the nation's steady march towards totalitarianism.\n\nNot to worry. This is a done deal. There are no surprises awaiting us.\n\nThe powers-that-be have already rigged the system.\n\nThey--the corporations, the military industrial complex, the surveillance state, the monied elite, etc.--will not allow anyone to be appointed to the Supreme Court who will dial back the police state. They will not tolerate anyone who will undermine their policies, threaten their profit margins, or overturn their apple cart.\n\nScalia's replacement will be safe (i.e., palatable enough to withstand Congress' partisan wrangling), reliable and most important of all, an extension of the American police state.\n\nWith the old order dying off or advancing into old age rapidly, we've arrived at a pivotal point in the makeup of the Supreme Court. With every vacant seat on the Court and in key judgeships around the country, we are witnessing a transformation of the courts into pallid, legalistic bureaucracies governed by a new breed of judges who have been careful to refrain from saying, doing or writing anything that might compromise their future ambitions.\n\nToday, the judges most likely to get appointed today are well-heeled, well-educated (all of them attended either Yale or Harvard law schools) blank slates who have traveled a well-worn path from an elite law school to a prestigious judicial clerkship and then a pivotal federal judgeship.\n\nIn other words, it really doesn't matter whether a Republican or Democratic president appoints the next Supreme Court justice, because they will all look alike (in terms of their educational and professional background) and sound alike (they are primarily advocates for the government).\n\nGiven the turbulence of our age, with its police overreach, military training drills on American soil, domestic surveillance, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, wrongful convictions, and corporate corruption, the need for a guardian of the people's rights has never been greater.\n\nUnfortunately, as I document in Battlefield America: The War on the American People, what we have been saddled with instead are government courts dominated by technicians and statists who march in lockstep with the American police state.\n\nThis is true at all levels of the judiciary.\n\nThus, while what the nation needs is a constitutionalist, what we will get is a technician.\n\nIt's an important distinction.\n\nA legal constitutionalist believes that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law (the Constitution) and strives to hold the government accountable to abiding by the Constitution. A judge of this order will uphold the rights of the citizenry in the face of government abuses.\n\nA legal technician, on the other hand, is an arbitrator of the government's plethora of laws whose priority is maintaining order and preserving government power. As such, these judicial technicians are deferential to authority, whether government or business, and focused on reconciling the massive number of laws handed down by the government.\n\nJohn Roberts who joined the Supreme Court in 2005 as Chief Justice is a prime example of a legal technician. His view that the \"role of the judge is limited...to decide the cases before them\" speaks to a mindset that places the judge in the position of a referee.\n\nRoberts' approach to matters of law and justice can best be understood by a case dating back to his years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The case involved a 12-year-old black girl who was handcuffed, searched and arrested by police--all for eating a single French fry in violation of a ban on food in the D.C. metro station. Despite Roberts' ability to recognize the harshness of the treatment meted out to Ansche Hedgepeth for such a minor violation, he ruled that the girl's constitutional rights had not been violated in any way.\n\nThis is not justice meted out by a constitutionalist.\n\nThis is how a technician rules, according to the inflexible letter of the law.\n\nCircuit Judge Sri Srinivasan of the DC Court of Appeals, who is rumored to be a favorite pick for Scalia's spot on the court, is another such technician. When asked to strike down a 60-year-old ban on expressive activities in front of the Supreme Court Plaza, Srinivasan turned a blind eye to the First Amendment.\n\nSrinivasan's rationale? \"Allowing demonstrations directed at the Court, on the Court's own front terrace, would tend to yield the opposite impression: that of a Court engaged with -- and potentially vulnerable to -- outside entreaties by the public.\"\n\nThis view of the Supreme Court as an entity that must be sheltered from select outside influences--for example, the views of the citizenry--is shared by the members of the Court itself to a certain extent who, as Lithwick points out, have become \"worryingly cloistered, even for a famously cloistered institution... today's justices filter out anything that might challenge their perspectives.\"\n\nAre you getting the picture yet?\n\nThe members of the Supreme Court are part of a ruling aristocracy composed of men and women who primarily come from privileged backgrounds and who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.\n\nWhen you're cocooned within the rarefied, elitist circles in which most of the judiciary operate, it can be difficult to see the humanity behind the facts of a case, let alone identify with the terror and uncertainty that most people feel when heavily armed government agents invade their homes, or subject them to a virtual strip search, or taser them into submission.\n\nNow do you understand why the Supreme Court's decisions in recent years have been characterized most often by an abject deference to government authority, military and corporate interests?\n\nThey no longer work for us. They no longer represent us. They can no longer relate to our suffering.\n\nIn the same way that the Legislative Branch, having been co-opted by lobbyists, special interests, and the corporate elite, has ceased to function as a vital check on abuses by the other two branches of government, the Judicial Branch has also become part of the same self-serving bureaucracy.\n\nSound judgment, compassion and justice have taken a back seat to legalism, statism and elitism.\n\nPreserving the rights of the people has been deprioritized and made to play second fiddle to both governmental and corporate interests.\n\nIn the case of the People vs. the Police State, the ruling is 9-0 against us.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nThe Supreme Court of old is gone, if not for good then at least for now.\n\nWe can no longer depend on the federal courts to protect us against the government. They are the government.\n\nYet as is the case with most things, the solution is far simpler and at the same time more complicated than space allows, but it starts with local action--local change--and local justice. If you want a revolution, start small, in your own backyard, and the impact will trickle up.\n\nIf you don't like the way justice is being meted out in America, then start demanding justice in your own hometown, before your local judges. Serve on juries, nullify laws that are egregious, picket in front of the courthouse, vote out judges (and prosecutors) who aren't practicing what the Constitution preaches, encourage your local newspapers to report on cases happening in your town, educate yourself about your rights, and make sure your local judges understand that they work for you and are not to be extensions of the police, prosecutors and politicians.\n\nThis is the only way we will ever have any hope of pushing back against the police state.", "Robert Fico, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and Beata Szydlo arrive to the V4 meeting in Prague. (Source: SITA)\n\nVISEGRAD is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Hungary. The mountains that roll up from the Danube shortly before Hungary falls into an endless flatland of the puszta, which reminded the roaming Hungarian tribes so much of the Asian steppe that they decided to stay.\n\nVisegrad however is also an endlessly sad place. The ruins recall the greatness of Hungary once ruled by the French kings; the Hungarian Kingdom that used to be, thanks to the gold and silver mines in Slovakia and the fertile Danube lowlands, a jewel among the states in the Middle Ages.\n\nA kingdom of which, after centuries of the Ottoman rule and decades of wars, almost nothing was left. At Visegrad, the biggest castle in the whole kingdom, we are invited to stretch our fantasy and imagine how big and advanced the civilisation was that almost ceased to exist here.\n\nVisegrad as we had known it in early 1990s was a great project of great times. It laid the basis of something unprecedented in this part of Europe: the cooperation of the central-European nations affected by nearly a half-century of totalitarianism and various forms of Soviet occupation that turned independent states into the vassal territories of the Kremlin.\n\nWhen Soviet rule fell, there was a threat that Central Europe could go back to the interwar times, when the lack of cooperation and often even hostility among Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovakia, made Central Europe an easy prey first for the Nazi Third Reich and then for the \"liberators\", Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\nFounding the Visegrad Group -- where the founding document carries the signatures of the Hungarian PM Jozsef Antall, Czechoslovak President V\u00e1clav Havel, and Polish President Lech Walesa -- laid the grounds for treating each other as partners rather than rivals. Visegrad has become part of the renewed Czech-Slovak partnership when after the rule of Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar the entire grouping helped Slovakia to catch up on the lost years and make it to the EU and the NATO.\n\nAfter entering the EU we still lived with the illusion that Visegrad could help western Europe to make the EU more immune from the return of totalitarianism in new forms, like those deployed by Putin's Russia or the communist-capitalist rulers in China.\n\nIt seemed that the ethos of the people who had the first hand-experience with jailing and decades of oppression, would help motivate western Europe to defend human rights in the world. There was hope it would make EU countries less willing to pursue business relations with Beijing, Moscow and other dictatorships while ignoring the violation of fundamental human rights, that it would give Europe the power and the determination to defend its own fundamental values.\n\nBut when we look at Central Europe now, we must smile ironically about this original Visegrad ideal. In its current form, as seen also from Monday's talks in Prague, the Visegrad Group is a distorted caricature of its original self.\n\nStates like Poland, Hungary, and partly Fico's Slovakia, not only aren't the guardians of the protection of democratic freedoms and ideals of the anti-totalitarian revolutions, but quite the contrary, they violate and limit the fundamentals of a functioning democratic regime.\n\nPerhaps the liberal democracy that their predecessors were trying to build here wasn't perfect and couldn't introduce everything that has worked in the western Europe, the United States, and other democratic countries of the world.\n\nBut what Orb\u00e1n brought about and what Kaczy\u0144ski is trying to endorse and what Fico will do if wins the elections, is not a better democracy, but a new form of undemocratic regime. It's not an improvement of democracy, it is its dismantling.\n\nVisegrad and the central-European cooperation today work as an excuse for why this part of Europe shouldn't be the West with all its democratic rules that need to be observed, with all the constitutional brakes that should prevent one party from dominating based on nationalist ideologies.\n\nThese ideologies are trying to suggest to central-European nations that if we do not follow the West, we will be better off. And the more proof comes to demonstarte that we aren't and we are not likely to be better off under Orb\u00e1n, Kaczy\u0144ski, and Fico, the more necessary it is to tighten the screws of the new oppression -- by invoking the fear of refugees and migration, of the dominance of Brussels, by suggesting fears of Germany or by demonising the United States. And by pulling Central Europe away from the core of the European Union.\n\nThere is only one aim of that: for the local rulers who have confused their one time election with a life-long mandate to be able to do whatever they want with the citizens of their Central Europe. And nobody from Brussels, Berlin, or Washington, will interfere.\n\nThe Visegrad that we live in today has no added value for Europe, but is rather a toxic body that might dissolve the European Union and the NATO through the gradual corrosion of the fundamental values that these communities stand on.\n\nIn order for that not to happen, those Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians who do not want to live in a new form of totalitarianism must use the rest of the freedom they've got to revolt against the direction Central Europe is heading.\n\nFor that revolt it is still enough to go to the elections and not vote for the politicians who are trying to deprive us of freedom that we gained quarter a century ago -- the same freedom the Visegrad was founded to protect and promote quarter a century ago.\n\nAs seen from Monday's summit in Prague, that Visegrad looks to be in ruins now, just like of that mighty castle above the Danube.", "The historic tide of people braving the journey to Europe in the past year has refocused the world's attention on wars most of the refugees are fleeing -- in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut after these three countries, the largest group of people fleeing to Europe last year hails from a small African nation that gets much less international attention.\n\nEritrea is a totalitarian state, ruled by the country's first and only president, Isaias Afwerki. Few outsiders are allowed to see what goes on inside its borders.\n\nBut those who have escaped tell harrowing stories that include indefinite forced conscription, prison camps and widespread torture. A United Nations commission report last year, based on interviews with over 500 people who had fled the country, said the regime may be responsible for crimes against humanity.", "Ostend: Stefan Zweig, Joseph Roth, and the Summer Before the Dark\n\nIn the summer of 1936, a cast of Europe's literary elite and political rebels gather at the Belgian seaside resort town of Ostend: to write, to love, to argue, and to contemplate their next move in a world grown dark and deadly. Dangerous characters? If you count idealists, cynics, writers, Communists, and Jews dangerous. Which, of course, the spreading fist of fascism does.\n\nEurope is about to disintegrate into war, but already this motley (yet stylish) cast has felt the chill. Jewish writers like Joseph Roth have had their books banned in Germany and other fascist strongholds; Jewish writers like Stefan Zweig who try to stay out of politics face ostracism for still being published in these same countries.\n\nZweig, however, is a millionaire, unlike his impoverished friend Roth. Zweig has just left his wife and daughters for his secretary Lotte Altmann; upon joining him the sickly Roth and the dashing, beautiful German novelist Irmgard Keun quickly hit it off. Fascism, exile, war, and love -- the ingredients for a master novel are all here, only this is real life, not art. Sometimes the distinction is hard to draw.\n\nVolker Weidermann, a journalist, editor, and literary historian, takes full advantage of this blurred boundary to offer an extended literary essay that reads with all the power and passion of a novel itself. He paints a stirring portrait of these characters and their gathering together at this particular moment in time. His stylized yet impressively researched work Ostend: Stefan Zweig, Joseph Roth, and the Summer Before the Dark is a beautiful example of literary journalism and storytelling.\n\nThe short yet powerful book (brilliantly translated by Carol Brown Janeway, who tragically died shortly after completing it) chronicles these larger-than-life figures, wrapping its action around that fateful and beautiful summer of 1936 in Ostend, but crafting a larger sense of time and place all round it. The dynamics of a complicated literary friendship between Stefan Zweig and Joseph Roth intersects with those of literary romance (Joseph Roth and Irmgard Keun).\n\nAround them are woven an equally dramatic and powerful cast of secondary characters: the journalist and writer Arthur Koestler; the Communist organizer Willi Muenzenberg; the wealthy and famous journalist Egon Erwin Kisch; playwright Ernst Toller; poet Emile Verhaeren; actress Christiane Grautoff; the struggling novelist Hermann Kesten who would outlive them all; and several more. They argue politics; they write beautiful literature; they love with all the pain and passion that feeling is capable of producing. Although the summer of 1936 is the focus of the novel, Weidermann backtracks and fast-forwards as necessary to help us understand the characters, the powerful forces and histories that have led them to this moment, and finally, the fate that pursues each of them after they part ways.\n\nThis is a history that reads like the best narrative fiction. The reader does not care that the action transpired eight decades ago; the passion and struggle depicted here feels like yesterday.\n\nWeidermann evokes a remarkable sense of spirit and place: re-animating dark evenings of furious writing in bistros fueled on schnapps and smoke; boisterous dinners of unrestrained laughter and anxious arguments on quayside patios as the lowering sun's shadows set the summer sea aglow; love and schnapps and writing and more schnapps and maybe more writing before sunset and schnapps over still and silent waters. Weidermann brings to life an era and the unique literary and artistic circle it produced.\n\nThere's a sense of pending loss, a sense of setting sun and summer's end that aptly reflects the grim reality of war, totalitarianism and devastation these frolicking yet hard-working artists were about to return to. It's a sort of adieu to the innocence some of them still cling to, an adieu to their hopes that the world could avoid another conflagration of arms. Indeed, it's an adieu not just to that world but to a certain unique spirit which animated its writers and artists.\n\nOne senses Weidermann's nostalgia for the intense literary friendships and companionships induced by the shared experience of looming exile, of persecution, but above all of mutual and collective inspiration. Zweig does his best to look after his unhealthy, alcoholic friend Roth, lending him money and companionship and literary advice; but in the end it is Roth who reciprocates this friendship with a thank you and a fully written passage for a part of Zweig's latest book he had been struggling over. Art imitates life imitates art; for these characters art and life truly were inseparable.\n\nOstend is a beautiful jewel of a book; an all-too-brief breath of the rarefied air of another era. If that summer at Ostend revitalized Zweig and Roth and all the others against the coming of the dark, so too Weidermann's stirring account of it revitalizes the contemporary reader 80 years later."]}}
