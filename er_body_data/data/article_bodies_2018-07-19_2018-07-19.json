The Korean won fell against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index shed 7.82 points, or 0.34 percent, to close at 2,282.29, extending its losing streak to a fourth straight session. Trade volume was moderate at 458 million shares worth 5.36 trillion won (US$4.73 billion), with losers outnumbering gainers 643 to 182.\n\nThe index opened higher on foreign buying amid positive assessments on the U.S. economy by its central bank and upbeat outlooks for the second corporate earnings.\n\nBut offshore investors scaled down their buying to pick up a net 53.2 billion won worth of local shares, while individuals and institutions sold off a net 34 billion won and 17.9 billion won, respectively.\n\n\"Investor sentiment seems to have remained weak, as worries over global trade disputes prevail in the market,\" said Seo Sang-young, an expert at Kiwoon Securities.\n\n\"But the U.S. has expressed confidence in its economic circumstances in the second half, and it could be a positive source for the local stock market as it boosts expectations for a growth in exports,\" he added.\n\nSteel shares drifted lower, as the European Union is to impose tariff quotas of 25 percent on a number of steel products. Top steelmaker POSCO shed 1.41 percent to 314,500 won, and Hyundai Steel fell 1.25 percent to 47,400 won.\n\nMaterials and utilities also lost ground, with state-run utility firm KEPCO falling 0.96 percent to 30,850 won and Hyundai Cement nosediving 6.22 percent to 45,200 won.\n\nThe bearish market hurt financials. KB Financial retreated 2.9 percent to 53,600 won, after reporting a 4.4 percent fall in its second-quarter net profit, and Shinhan Financial moved down 1 percent to 44,500 won.\n\nBut big-cap tech shares gathered ground, limiting any further downturn in the market.\n\nMarket bellwether Samsung Electronics advanced 0.75 percent to 46,900 won, and SK hynix surged 1.12 percent to 90,300 won.\n\nAuto makers also showed brisk movement on the back of the government's tax incentives for car buyers. Kia Motors soared 0.95 percent to 31,900 won, and Hyundai Mobis, an auto parts unit of Hyundai Motor Group, rose 0.45 percent to 222,000 won. Top carmaker Hyundai Motor remained unchanged at 124,000 won.\n\nBio shares finished mixed. Samsung Biologics soared 2.17 percent to end at 423,500 won, while pharmaceutical giant Celltrion decreased 0.52 percent to 288,500 won.\n\nThe South Korean currency closed at 1,133.20 won against the U.S. dollar, down 0.9 won from Wednesday's close.\n\nBond prices, which move inversely to yields, ended lower.

As the company requires to increase its market cap by nearly six per cent to become a trillion-dollar company, can India pitch in?\n\nAccording to industry experts, India is the fastest-growing among the top 20 smartphone markets globally, with a large untapped user base potential in Tier 5 and 6 cities and beyond.\n\nThe rapid growth of the smartphone market can be attributed to several factors like low smartphone penetration, inexpensive mobile data and growing aspirational middle class.\n\n\"As a result, the Indian smartphone market continues to look fertile in the coming years, helping brands grow and enhance their portfolios.\n\n\"Certainly, for Apple too, it's a big market to target and grow as the aspirational buyers continue to opt for this luxury brand,\" Upasana Joshi, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, told IANS.\n\nThe current smartphone user base in India is at 400 million which is set to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Apple's market share in India has grown in recent years. It is a premium range player and is performing well in that segment in the country,\" says Anshul Gupta, Research Director at Gartner.\n\nAccording to Gupta, like any other major player, the iPhone maker is bullish on the country and plans to expand its operations.\n\n\"Whether India will help it become the $1 trillion company is not known yet -- but yes, the smartphone market in India is growing across price segments, providing ample opportunities for Apple,\" Gupta told IANS.\n\nApart from Samsung, which recently unveiled the world's largest mobile factory in India, another big worry for Apple are a couple of Chinese players who have wooed a big chunk of aspirational users who would otherwise have shifted to new iPhones.\n\n\"Chinese players like OnePlus and Oppo have stopped the flow of users to Apple by selling premium devices in the Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 range with the latest features. The charm of owning older iPhones is also over as large displays with better aspect ratios are now being preferred,\" Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst at Forrester Research, told IANS.\n\nUnless Apple manufactures the latest iPhones here and sells them cheap, things won't change and may further deteriorate, he warned.\n\nCompared to the US, India is a \"mobile first\" market and, hence, most of the digital services are designed around smartphones which makes them central to the users' lives.\n\n\"However, compared to the US, the average selling price (ASP) in India is more skewed around $150, making it a tough market for Apple where even the older models such as iPhone 6S are being sold for $300 -- thus reducing the overall total addressable market (TAM) opportunity for it to capitalise strongly,\" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.\n\nToday, \"Apple has a two per cent share of smartphone sales in the Indian market and the remaining 98 per cent of the market has been warming up to, and becoming deeply entrenched in, the Android ecosystem,\" Pathak added.\n\nApple is currently assembling just one model in India -- the iPhone 6S (earlier it was iPhone SE which didn't make much headway) -- with its partner Wistron. Missing are the iPhone 7, 8 or X series which further distances Apple from the overall opportunity.\n\n\"Apple can still remain bullish on India with only 30 per cent of the population using smartphone and a potential opportunity for all the players in the mobile ecosystem, including Apple,\" Pathak noted.\n\nAccording to Joshi, Apple has been successful in India, evident from the fact that iPhone users are some of the most loyal users among all smartphone brands, waiting eagerly to get their hands on the new model of iPhone.\n\nStill, being merely bullish may not help Apple in the near future. The time is ripe to take some concrete steps, bring India on its global sales map, and cross the $1 trillion-dollar hurdle.", "This would put it in competition with the Apple Home Pod and the Google Home Max.\n\nSamsung is reportedly planning to release a Bixby powered smart speaker in the next month. According to The Wall Street Journal (Via The Verge), the device will cost around $300 and will be marketed as a high-end music player.\n\nThis fits in with comments from Samsung Mobile chief DJ Koh made in February where he said Samsung expected to release a premium Bixby-powered smart speaker alongside the Galaxy Note 9.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says the speaker will be bowl-shaped with legs on the bottom and lights on top (hope those lights are shaped like eyes for the proper Batteries Not Included experience). It will also apparently have a sound shifting feature that will be able to play audio in the direction of the person talking to it, so it may seem like it responds more directly rather than speaking \"to the room.\"\n\nThe speaker will presumably use the upcoming Bixby version 2.0. The new version of Samsung's AI assistant has long been rumored to feature on the Galaxy Note 9, so it would make a lot of sense that the speaker would also come with the latest version (if they launch simultaneously).\n\nWhile previous rumors suggested Samsung would release different versions of its smart speaker at different prices, this wasn't mentioned by The Wall Street Journal in the latest report. However, considering both Google and Amazon have released cheaper versions of their respective smart speakers, it wouldn't be surprising if Samsung eventually does the same.\n\nIf the $300 price-tag is correct, the speaker would be competing with -- although slightly cheaper than -- high-end devices such as the Apple HomePod ($349.99) and Google Home Max ($399). As well as a more attractive price, Samsung could give its speaker an edge by integrating its wealth of existing products.\n\nSamsung will have to convince people that its Bixby Assistant is the one that they want to have in their homes, however. Considering the popularity of Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant, this could be the toughest hurdle to overcome.", "Samsung is reportedly planning to release its next-generation smartwatch dubbed the Galaxy Watch on August 24, the same date that the Galaxy Note 9 will launch. According to a new report from ZDNet South Korea, the initial unveiling of the Galaxy Watch will take place on August 9, a date confirmed by Samsung to be the launch date for the Galaxy Note 9. Like all other previous announcements for the phablet device, the launch event this year will happen during the Galaxy Unpacked in New York, with pre-orders for both the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Note 9 expected to open on August 14.\n\nThe Galaxy Watch branding first cropped up in a trademark application filed by Samsung with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), as reported last May, leading to the speculation that this could be the name of the upcoming wearable from the company instead of the Samsung Gear S4. The Galaxy Watch marks a significant shift in the South Korean giant's smartwatch strategy since it will be the first wearable device under the Galaxy brand, a likely departure from the Gear branding. There are reportedly two versions of the smartwatch that will be shipped to consumers, each variant having a different size. And while previous rumors suggested that Samsung's next-generation smartwatch will be powered by the Wear OS, the Galaxy Watch will supposedly run the Tizen operating system instead, according to industry sources in South Korea. Additionally, the wearable device will include a host of health care and fitness apps.\n\nEarlier this month, it was also rumored that the Galaxy Watch will feature native support for Bixby, though the addition of Samsung's artificial intelligence companion won't be expected to lead to a third physical button being incorporated into the upcoming smartwatch, like what happened with existing smartphones that support Bixby. The digital assistant will instead serve as a direct replacement for the S Voice app. Other recent rumors surrounding the upcoming gadget indicated that the Galaxy Watch will have a 470mAh battery, which is notably larger than that of its predecessor. With that capacity, the smartwatch is expected to last for roughly three days or so.", "The 7-inch display when folded out will be roughly the size of a small tablet along with a small secondary display on one side. When opened, the phone will be almost all screen.\n\nSamsung's upcoming foldable smartphone has become the talk of the town for a while now and it seems that the company might finally release it next year. Reportedly, the foldable smartphone will arrive as early as 2019.\n\nAs per a report of The Wall Street Journal, the upcoming Samsung smartphone will be internally codenamed 'Winner' and feature a 7-inch display with a folding screen which can be folded in half \"like a wallet\". It is said to be officially announced in early 2019. It is to be noted that this is inline with the previous report suggesting that Samsung might launch the device during Mobile World Congress in February next year.\n\nThe report says that 7-inch display when folded out will be roughly the size of a small tablet along with a small secondary display on one side. When opened, the phone will be almost all screen, the report notes.\n\nIn the same report, the Wall Street Journal has also revealed that Samsung Bixby speaker will also be officially announced during the Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on August 9.\n\nAs per a recent report, the smartphone will be named as Galaxy X and will come with a price tag of $1,850, which roughly translate to a whopping Rs 1,25,180. If this is believed to be true, then this will Samsung's most expensive smartphone ever. Coming to the foldable smartphone, it is reported to feature a massive 7.3-inch display, which when folded, can shrink to a 4.5-inch screen. On the specifications front, the latest device could share a similar specs sheet of the Galaxy S10.", "Two minutes after the Queen arrived at Windsor Guildhall this man was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting just yards away by armed officers\n\nA man has been arrested just yards away from the Queen during Black Friday on suspicion of shoplifting.\n\nThe unnamed man was bundled into a police car by armed protection officers who were on duty protecting Her Majesty as she unveiled two stained glass windows.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh joined her in the Ascot Room where the windows, which commemorate her Jubilee, are housed.\n\nElsewhere a male shopper was arrested at an Asda store during the Black Friday scramble for cut-price goods which has seen bargain hunters behaving 'like savages'.\n\nThese extraordinary pictures show the man being tackled and then wrestled to the ground by security guards at the store in Cribbs Causeway, Bristol.\n\nHe was arrested following a row over two 60-inch televisions as thousands of people across the country bombarded stores selling discounted DVD players, phones and tablets.\n\nEyewitnesses said trouble flared up when staff told the man, 35, was only allowed to buy one of each product.\n\nHe was escorted from the store by security guards and was finally restrained by five members of staff - with one employee suffering a cut face.\n\nOne witness said: 'He was being told by staff at Asda that he wasn't allowed to buy two TVs.\n\n'Security then escorted him and he was arguing and filming them on his mobile phone when it was knocked out of his hand.\n\n'He ended up being carted off handcuffed in a police car but it was the security guards who got physical.'\n\nScroll down for videos\n\nArrest: A shopper has been arrested after a row broke out at the Asda store in Cribbs Causeway, Bristol\n\nHeld: The male shopper, who was trying to buy two 60-inch televisions, was restrained by security and staff members at the store this morning\n\nOfficers from Avon and Somerset Police arrived at the store and arrested a man.\n\nA police spokesman said: 'We were called to Asda to reports a security guard had been assaulted.\n\n'He suffered a cut to the face but declined an ambulance.

New research from consumer experts Which? reveals that discounts aren't always what they seem.\n\nThat means your bargain washing machine may be cheaper at other times of year, or that an advertised 50 per cent discount is not strictly accurate. Alice Smellie asks Richard Headland, editor of Which? magazine, for his comprehensive guide to Black Friday and how to avoid any possible pitfalls.\n\nPrinted maxi dress, was \u00a3125, now \u00a362, lauraashley.com\n\nIS IT REALLY A BARGAIN?\n\nBlack Friday is a marketing gimmick designed to get people to spend lots of money quickly. We often naively assume that anything with a seemingly large price drop on Black Friday must be a bargain.\n\nAt Which? we tracked 178 deals for three months before and two months after Black Friday 2015 -- and 49 per cent were cheapest on a day other than Black Friday. Only eight per cent of the deals we looked at were cheaper on Black Friday than any other day in those five months.\n\nA Samsung TV at Currys was priced at \u00a3749 from October 30, 2015, and marked down to \u00a3748 on Black Friday. The store claimed a saving of \u00a3101, which there was from a previous price, but the saving from the previous day was just \u00a31. And for 18 days in late summer it was priced at \u00a3699. AO.com advertised a Vax Air vacuum cleaner at \u00a399 on Black Friday last year.\n\nNot bad, but on average it cost just \u00a396.50 in the previous three months. And on the day before Black Friday -- November 23 -- it sold for \u00a369.\n\nAO said it had followed the regulations by always showing the initial 'was' price for promotions.\n\nCurrys also said it had followed regulations and the guidelines. It said by showing the 'was' price and the dates the product was sold at this price, consumers could decide for themselves.\n\nIt added that it showed these dates online, in store and in adverts.\n\nBlack Friday is a marketing gimmick designed to get people to spend lots of money quickly. We often naively assume that anything with a seemingly large price drop on Black Friday must be a bargain\n\nGET THE REAL DEAL\n\nCheck the price of the product you want at several shops -- price comparison websites are useful.\n\nEnsure it really is a discount by checking the price history. Pricerunner. co.uk, CamelCamelCamel. com and the Which? website (which.co.uk) all show old prices.\n\nAnd 38 per cent of the deals we checked cost less after Black Friday -- particularly in the January sales.\n\nNew research from consumer experts Which? reveals that discounts aren't always what they seem. That means your bargain washing machine may be cheaper at other times of year, or that an advertised 50 per cent discount is not strictly accurate - so do your research!\n\nSPOT THE SCAMS\n\nFor online fraudsters, Black Friday is a day of rich pickings. Don't give any website your pin number and only buy from retailers you know and trust.\n\nIf the firm just has a PO Box address, a mobile number or a premium rate '09' number, be very wary.\n\nFor online fraudsters, Black Friday is a day of rich pickings.

According to a report on the Wall Street Journal, the Galaxy X prototype \"Winner\" features a fully bendable 7-inch screen, which is roughly the size of a regular tablet. The design of the device is such that it lets users fold the phone in half \"like a wallet\", the report notes. Based on the current design, the exterior of the phone shows a screen on the front and cameras on the back.\n\nThe South Korean major might change the design of the phone, the journal claims. Evidently, the launch of the Galaxy X is the company's top priority at the moment. Although the Journal never uses the name Galaxy X anywhere, it is expected to the company's third flagship series after the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note. Samsung hopes to target the foldable smartphone at hardcore gamers initially. A broader commercial launch is expected to happen in the second half of 2019.\n\nAlso read: Samsung Galaxy X to launch in January, Galaxy S10 in February: Report\n\nIt's being said that Samsung doesn't expect the Galaxy X to be a global best-seller like the Galaxy S9+ or the Note 8. In the same report, the Wall Street Journal claims that the Galaxy X could be priced in the vicinity of $1500 (or approx Rs 1,03,342). People familiar with the matter told the publication that the components including a foldable screen and the external display bar would require a bigger screen, which could overheat. In addition, the device would require a powerful chip, which could further drive up costs.\n\nAlso read: Samsung to start trial production of foldable OLED displays this summer: Report\n\nThe Galaxy X, Samsung's first foldable smartphone, has been in development for years.

'So from a positive perspective, having certainty on that is probably a good thing looking into the holiday.'\n\nThe consumer expectations index of the survey rose by 8.4 points from October to 85.2 - the biggest gain within a month since December 2011, according to he University of Michigan's final reading of consumer sentiment for November\n\nMarvin Ellison, J.C.

The holidays start,' Mrs. Obama exclaimed after 'accepting' the tree from Dave and Mary Vander Velden, owners of the Oconto, Wisconsin, farm where it was grown.\n\n'We're ready. Our last one. We're excited about it.'\n\nLate Friday morning, a horse-drawn wagon pulled the tree up the White House driveway. After a visual inspection, Mrs. Obama sought the opinions of her 'replacement kids' -- nephews Austin and Aaron Robinson.\n\nOn Friday, Michelle Obama kicked off her family's final Christmas season at the White House by receiving a 19-foot Balsam-Veitch fir from Wisconsin as the official White House Christmas tree", "New Delhi: At nearly $940 billion, Apple is certainly well on the way to becoming the world's first trillion dollar company -- and the feat could be achieved as early as the end of this year with upcoming iPhone launches.\n\nThe tech giant crossed the $900 billion market capitalisation mark in November last year following the launch of its \"super premium\" iPhone X and, according to CEO Tim Cook, in India,\"we set a new first-half record\" as Apple reported record results for the first quarter of 2018.\n\nHowever, in India -- the world's third-largest smartphone market -- the Cupertino-based iPhone maker has not crossed sales of 2-3 per cent despite arriving in the country almost a decade back.\n\nTrying hard to make inroads, the company is currently going through an overhaul under Michel Coulomb, the new head of the India operations who took over from Sanjay Kaul in December last year.\n\nThe iPhone maker is also seeking tax relief and other incentives from the government to begin assembling more handsets in the country and its proposal to set up a manufacturing unit is reportedly being evaluated.\n\nIn 2017, Apple sold nearly 3.2 million iPhones in India. As the company requires to increase its market cap by nearly six per cent to become a trillion-dollar company, can India pitch in?\n\nAccording to industry experts, India is the fastest-growing among the top 20 smartphone markets globally, with a large untapped user base potential in Tier 5 and 6 cities and beyond.\n\nThe rapid growth of the smartphone market can be attributed to several factors like low smartphone penetration, inexpensive mobile data and growing aspirational middle class.\n\n\"As a result, the Indian smartphone market continues to look fertile in the coming years, helping brands grow and enhance their portfolios.\n\n\"Certainly, for Apple too, it's a big market to target and grow as the aspirational buyers continue to opt for this luxury brand,\" Upasana Joshi, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, told IANS.\n\nThe current smartphone user base in India is at 400 million which is set to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Apple's market share in India has grown in recent years. It is a premium range player and is performing well in that segment in the country,\" says Anshul Gupta, Research Director at Gartner.\n\nAccording to Gupta, like any other major player, the iPhone maker is bullish on the country and plans to expand its operations.\n\n\"Whether India will help it become the $1 trillion company is not known yet -- but yes, the smartphone market in India is growing across price segments, providing ample opportunities for Apple,\" Gupta told IANS.\n\nApart from Samsung, which recently unveiled the world's largest mobile factory in India, another big worry for Apple are a couple of Chinese players who have wooed a big chunk of aspirational users who would otherwise have shifted to new iPhones.\n\n\"Chinese players like OnePlus and Oppo have stopped the flow of users to Apple by selling premium devices in the Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 range with the latest features. The charm of owning older iPhones is also over as large displays with better aspect ratios are now being preferred,\" Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst at Forrester Research, told IANS.\n\nUnless Apple manufactures the latest iPhones here and sells them cheap, things won't change and may further deteriorate, he warned.\n\nCompared to the US, India is a \"mobile first\" market and, hence, most of the digital services are designed around smartphones which makes them central to the users' lives.\n\n\"However, compared to the US, the average selling price (ASP) in India is more skewed around $150, making it a tough market for Apple where even the older models such as iPhone 6S are being sold for $300 -- thus reducing the overall total addressable market (TAM) opportunity for it to capitalise strongly,\" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.\n\nToday, \"Apple has a two per cent share of smartphone sales in the Indian market and the remaining 98 per cent of the market has been warming up to, and becoming deeply entrenched in, the Android ecosystem,\" Pathak added.\n\nApple is currently assembling just one model in India -- the iPhone 6S (earlier it was iPhone SE which didn't make much headway) -- with its partner Wistron. Missing are the iPhone 7, 8 or X series which further distances Apple from the overall opportunity.\n\n\"Apple can still remain bullish on India with only 30 per cent of the population using smartphone and a potential opportunity for all the players in the mobile ecosystem, including Apple,\" Pathak noted.\n\nAccording to Joshi, Apple has been successful in India, evident from the fact that iPhone users are some of the most loyal users among all smartphone brands, waiting eagerly to get their hands on the new model of iPhone.\n\nStill, being merely bullish may not help Apple in the near future. The time is ripe to take some concrete steps, bring India on its global sales map, and cross the $1 trillion-dollar hurdle.", "Since it was gleefully adopted by the UK seven years ago, the name Black Friday has been synonymous with amazing, money-saving deals.\n\nIt is the day when, for a glorious 24 hours of plummeting prices and discounts, the consumer appears to come out on top -- and, this year, it's at the end of this week.\n\nOriginally an American concept, Black Friday falls the day after their Thanksgiving holiday and marks the start of the Christmas shopping season.\n\nThe Daily Mail has compared Black Friday prices to the better bargains you can bag at other points in the year\n\nThe Samsung 55-inch Smart 4k Ultra HD HDR curved TV KU6670 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3400, now \u00a3849' (was \u00a31,249 from May 11, 2016 to June 22) but it was \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times in December, January and April, the same price at least seven times in April and \u00a379 cheaper at least 18 times in May\n\nIn Britain, it's simply seen as a good excuse to go bargain hunting -- and deals are starting earlier than ever this year.\n\nWith many shops already advertising their Black Friday offers, we're expected to splash out \u00a310 billion before this week is out.\n\nBut in this frenzy of spending are you really getting a good deal? In many cases, it would appear not.\n\nThe Nutri Ninja BL450 blender with pulse technology (silver) was advertised at \u00a344.99 but was \u00a35 cheaper at least 22 times in April and May\n\nThe Fitbit Blaze was advertised as 'Save \u00a320, was \u00a3159.99, now \u00a3139.99' (\u00a3159.99 from March 1 to Nov 15). But it was \u00a310 cheaper at least nine times in January, \u00a37 cheaper for the rest of the Black Friday sale period (other than Black Friday itself), and the same price 124 times between October and May\n\nA year-long investigation by consumer experts Which? has found that an astonishing six out of ten of last year's 'deals' were for products that were, in fact, cheaper or the same price at other times of the year.\n\nThe research tracked the prices of 35 of the most popular technology, home and personal care products on sale on Black Friday 2016, but the results throw the entire validity of the Black Friday 'deal' into question.\n\nRichard Headland, editor-in-chief of Which? Magazine, says: 'From a consumer point of view, it's obviously very frustrating.\n\nBeats Solo 2 wireless black headphones (also in yellow) were advertised at \u00a3169. But they were cheaper by \u00a319 for at least two days in February and the same price for at least two days in December\n\nThe one day on which you assume you're getting the best deal ever is that last Friday in November.\n\n'We think it's misleading on the part of the retailers, who are happy to hype up the size of Black Friday discounts.\n\n'Retailers disagree, though. They argue that just because a product is included in a Black Friday sale, it doesn't stop them discounting it at other times of year, too. That's true, but it's also a tacit acceptance that there may be better times to shop for a bargain.'\n\nWho are the culprits?\n\nSome of the worst offenders were some of our top retailers and the deals make sorry reading.\n\nThere was the Neff Slide and Hide oven from Currys/PC World. It sounded like a good deal at \u00a3494.99, particularly as the retailer's adverts claimed it had been priced at \u00a3599.99 throughout September and most of October.\n\nBut the oven was actually cheaper than the Black Friday price for at least 113 other days of the year. It cost \u00a3449.99 -- \u00a345 cheaper -- just three weeks later.\n\nThe Neff Slide and Hide oven was cheaper than on Black Friday for at least 113 days of the year. It was advertised on Black Friday at '\u00a3494.99 -- 10 pc off the marked price of \u00a3549.99' (was \u00a3599.99 September 1 to October 18). The lowest price in the year was \u00a3419, at least 33 times in April and May. It was \u00a3449.99 at least 49 times from mid-Dec to February\n\nA Samsung 55-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD curved TV was advertised in Currys/PC World as 'Save \u00a3400, now \u00a3849', but was \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times in December, January and April, the same price at least seven times in April, and \u00a379 cheaper at least 18 times in May.\n\nThere were similar anomalies with the Fitbit Blaze, a Samsung Ecobubble 8kg washing machine, and an HP Envy 4524 all-in-one wireless inkjet printer.\n\nThe DeLonghi bean-to-cup coffee machine looked like a bargain last Black Friday at \u00a3349 in Currys/PC World -- a huge saving on the \u00a3729.99 that the retailer's advertising stated it had been for most of September and October.\n\nThe Samsung 49-inch Smart 4k Ultra HD HDR curved TV KU6670 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3250, now \u00a3699' (it was \u00a3949 from May 11 to June 22). But it was also \u00a3699 at least 18 times before Black Friday in August and September. It was also \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times afterwards in December, January and April\n\nHowever, Which? data showed that it was priced at \u00a3579.99 for nearly three weeks when the ad claimed it was selling at \u00a3729.99. Plus, it remained at the Black Friday price for almost all of December.\n\nThey also slipped up with a Braun 3040s Series 3 electric shaver and Sony MDR-ZX770AP on-ear headphones, among other items. An Oral B electric toothbrush from Amazon was advertised as 'save 26 per cent -- was \u00a340.49, now \u00a329.99'.\n\nIt sounded like a good offer, until you realise it was \u00a35 cheaper on at least two days in July.\n\nYou may feel that this casts a bit of a cloud over the whole Black Friday experience. The build-up has already been diluted by the fact that so many shops have been discounting goods all month.\n\nThe Braun 3040s Series 3 electric shaver was advertised at \u00a339.99 but was the same price at least nine times in June and July, and between \u00a34 and \u00a35 cheaper at least five times in December\n\nThere are also suggestions that UK discounts aren't as high as those in other countries.\n\nWhile online prices here were cut by an average of 12 per cent last year, according to UK retail strategy expert Jamie Merrick, of Salesforce Commerce Cloud, they were down a whopping 29 per cent in the U.S., and 20 and 23 per cent in Germany and France respectively.\n\nHowever, it seems that 31 per cent of households are planning on getting involved, and there are predictions that \u00a31.74 million will be spent online every minute of the day itself, \u00a33 billion will be spent over the four days from Friday to Monday and more than \u00a310 billion during the week.\n\nCommerce consultancy Salmon expects there will be \u00a320 billion-worth of online sales in November, overtaking December sales -- which, for retailers at least, is good news.\n\nFrom toothbrushes to children's bikes, here are some Black Friday deals really worth shelling out for\n\nRevealed, the bogus offers where those 'savings' just didn't add up\n\nCurrys/PC World -- Eight deals were cheaper or the same price after Black Friday:\n\nThe Samsung 55-inch Smart 4k Ultra HD HDR curved TV KU6670 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3400' now \u00a3849 (was \u00a31,249 from May 11, 2016 to June 22) but was \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times in December, January and April, the same price at least seven times in April and \u00a379 cheaper at least 18 times in May.The DeLonghi Magnifica bean-to-cup coffee machine was advertised at \u00a3349, 'Save \u00a3380' (was \u00a3729.99 from Sept 6 to Oct 10, 2016) but was the same price at least 28 times in December. Indeed, Which? price research shows it was actually \u00a3579.99 from Sept 6 to Sept 24.The Samsung wireless soundbar and subwoofer HW-K430 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3150, now \u00a3129.99' (was \u00a3279.99 from Sept 28-Oct 31). It was then the same price at least 18 times in Dec and Jan.The Fitbit Flex activity and sleep wristband (in black, slate or pink) was advertised at \u00a339.99 'Save \u00a340' (was \u00a379.99 from Oct 20 to Nov 12).

The lowest price over the year was \u00a3419, which it was at least 33 times in April and May. It was \u00a3449.99 at least 49 times from mid-Dec to Feb.The Samsung 49-inch Smart 4k Ultra HD HDR curved TV KU6670 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3250' now \u00a3699 (it was \u00a3949 from May 11 to June 22). But it was also \u00a3699 at least 18 times before Black Friday in August and September. It was also \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times afterwards in December, January and April.The Fitbit Blaze was advertised as 'Save \u00a320' was \u00a3159.99, now \u00a3139.99 (it was \u00a3159.99 from March 1 to Nov 15).

But if you waited just three weeks, until Dec 17, they were \u00a310 cheaper, as well as on at least 13 other days at the end of December.The Dyson V6 Fluffy cordless vacuum cleaner was advertised at \u00a3229.99 but was the same price at least four days at the end of December.The Philips Viva Air Fryer with rapid air technology was advertised at \u00a369.99 but was the same price at least 20 times afterwards in December and January.The Gtech AR02 AirRam filter bagless upright vacuum cleaner was advertised at \u00a3149.99 but was the same price on at least one occasion in early January.The Nutri Ninja BL450 blender with pulse technology (silver) was advertised at \u00a344.99 but was \u00a35 cheaper at least 22 times in April and May.\n\nThree deals were cheaper or the same price before and after Black Friday:\n\nThe LG UHD TV 4k LG49UH650V 49-inch UHD4k Web OS Smart LED TV was advertised as '\u00a3499 -- Our lowest price' but it was \u00a320 cheaper at least seven times at the end of Dec, \u00a34 cheaper at least 11 times in early Dec, and the same price at least 17 times between Nov and Jan.The Braun 3040s Series 3 electric shaver was advertised at \u00a339.99 but was the same price at least nine times in June and July, and between \u00a34 and \u00a35 cheaper at least five times in December.Sony MDR-ZX770AP on-ear headphones (black) were advertised as \u00a334.99 but were the same price for at least six days in early November 2016 and at least 16 times in December.\n\nHow to spot a true bargain\n\nHow do you avoid getting it wrong? Richard Headland, editor-in-chief of Which? Magazine, has some tips ...\n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH\n\nBe focused. Identify which products you want to look for and get a feel for prices. You can use Which? to look up product reviews and find out current and historical prices at a range of popular retailers, or websites such as CamelCamelCamel for Amazon price history. Compare what looks like a good Black Friday deal with other retailers. Don't be swayed by a claimed 'saving'.\n\nWATCH THE HYPE\n\nWe're easily taken in by bright signs proclaiming 'Was \u00a3100, now \u00a350', but these may not be true. By law, a product has to have been on offer at the higher price for 28 days before a discount is offered, but this isn't always the case. As long as there is a note explaining the offer, shops get away with it.\n\nKEEP YOUR COOL\n\nYou are the target of aggressive marketing -- so stay cool and calm. More than ever, it's clear that it's not just a day of discounts, so if you're not convinced, then hold back.\n\nBEWARE THE RRP\n\nBe suspicious of RRP prices (recommended retail price). Officially, the manufacturer isn't allowed to set the price of a product. In reality, there is collaboration, so that a manufacturer will sell at a discount at the same time as an independent retailer. Apple is a good example of this. Having said that, you can still have a look at the RRP on the manufacturer's website, to see whether a retailer is being honest.\n\nPRICE PROMISES\n\nTry to buy from retailers with a price promise -- those who'll refund the difference if you find a better deal on the same product elsewhere, or if the price drops later.\n\nCOUNT IN DELIVERY\n\nLook at delivery costs in advance. In a Which? survey, four in ten people said paying for postage and packing was an irritating part of online shopping. Some retailers offer a buy online and pick up later service, which means you don't have to go near the shops on the day itself.\n\nPRODUCT REVIEWS\n\nCheck out reviews. In some cases, a discount on a product will be there for a good reason and shops might struggle to give them away.", "Black Friday is right around the corner, and with millions of shoppers planning to go bargain hunting in the hours after Thanksgiving, it is time to draft a strategy to make the most of the 2017 shopping extravaganza.\n\nAn exceptional 164 million people -- a whopping 69 per cent of Americans -- are expected to go shopping on Black Friday weekend, which stretches from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nThis year's projected attendance tops both last year's predictions, which forecast 154 million shoppers, and that of 2015, when 151 million people were expected to flock to the stores.\n\nBargain hunting: A whopping 164 million people are expected to hit the stores between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday this year (crowds are pictured shopping last year)\n\nSome go to extreme lengths to snag a good deal, with 17 per cent of Americans having missed at least a portion of a Thanksgiving celebration in favor of a Black Friday deal, according to experts at RetailMeNot.\n\nAnd when they do get to the stores, they're not shy about digging deep into their wallets, by spending an expected average of $743 on holiday shopping between Black Briday and Cyber Monday. This prediction is up from the still robust $505 registered in 2016.\n\nA good amount of people, however, shun the crowds altogether, and prefer to shop from the comfort of their own homes, perhaps while enjoying a Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich.\n\nAbout 51 per cent of shoppers do most of their purchases online, and 29 per cent have planned on splitting their time between stores and websites over the weekend.\n\nMost major retailers will begin their Black Friday sales on the evening of Thanksgiving Day to close at midnight and reopen the following morning.\n\nThis year's projected attendance tops both last year's predictions, which forecast 154 million shoppers (people are pictured purchasing electronics in Paramus, New Jersey in 2016)\n\nDoorbuster deals will be in full swing during that period, with additional sales and rebates available.\n\nOnly 20 per cent of shoppers are planning to do so on Thanksgiving Day, and Black Friday will remain the busiest day with 70 per cent of shoppers -- 115.7 million people -- planning to hit the stores then.\n\nFor those planning to pop the question, Macy's will offer 40 per cent off its diamond jewelry, including engagement rings. The retailer will also have 50 per cent off FAO Schwartz toys, including train sets, costumes, and the iconic giant pianos.\n\nHenri Bendel will give shoppers 30 per cent off all day on Black Friday, and those who are not in New York City will also enjoy 20 per cent off any purchase on the store's website.\n\nTECH\n\nTarget (starts at 6 pm on Thursday)\n\nAmazon Fire 7 tablet 7\" 8GB\n\nOriginally $49.99\n\n$29.99 Shop Apple Watch Series 1\n\nOriginally $249.99\n\n$179.99 Shop Sony PlayStation 4 1TB console\n\nOriginally $299.99\n\n$199.99 Shop urBeats headphones\n\nOriginally $99.99\n\n$49.99 Shop Nikon D3400 DSLR bundle\n\nOriginally $899.99\n\n$499.99 Shop HP 11.6\" Convertible Chromebook\n\nOriginally $299.99\n\n$219 Shop GoPro HERO5 Session bundle\n\nOriginally $339.99\n\n$249.99 Shop Fitbit Charge 2\n\nOriginally $149.95\n\n$99.95 Shop Samsung 65\" 4K Motion Rate 120 Smart UHD TV\n\nOriginally $1,299.99\n\n$849.99 Shop iPad\u00ae 32GB\n\nOriginally $329.99\n\n$249.99 Shop LG 55\" 4K TruMotion 120 Smart UHD TV\n\nOriginally $699.99\n\n$499.99 Shop\n\nBest Buy (starts at 5 pm on Thursday)\n\nDell -

If returns are not accepted and you are shopping for a gift, you may want to turn to the more reliable items on your list, which are sure to make your recipient happy. If you're unsure of sizing (clothes, shoes, or otherwise), find out if exchanges can be done in lieu of a full product return.\n\nUse a credit card that offers price protection\n\nWith these cards, if you find a better deal on the same items within 60-90 days, you can get the difference refunded to you.\n\nGifts for family and friends can break the bank, so think in tiers\n\nTier one is family, tier two is close friends and tier three is neighbors and co-workers.\n\nWhile it's easy to go overboard, spend about as much as you would on a typical night out with them. If your plans usually include a trip to the movies, keep that cost as your spending maximum. Don't be afraid to get crafty and make some nice homemade goodies to cut back on extra spending.\n\nWHAT TO BUY FOR BLACK FRIDAY:\n\nDesigner Brands\n\nLuxury clothing brands don't usually go on sale, which makes them extra attractive on Black Friday. Shopping in-store will allow consumers to actually see and feel the clothing before purchasing -- always a good idea since some retailers return policies can be tricky around the holidays.\n\nCookware\n\nThanksgiving will be over, but there will still plenty of holiday cooking and celebrating to be done. Several retailers will be marking down cookware items to help hosts prepare their kitchens for friends and family. They can also make great, affordable gifts.\n\nBeauty and health\n\nCosmetic stores will be making room for new holiday sets and seasonal product launches, and they will be looking to clear out their shelves.\n\nWhether you are looking for high-end beauty products, or everyday wellness finds, Black Friday is known to offer great discounts.\n\nThese items can be personal purchases, and also make great stocking stuffers.\n\nIF YOU MISS OUT ON...\n\nJewelry:\n\nDid the store run out of that beautiful ring you were eyeing? Don't panic! While jewelry is a go-to gift for a loved one during the holidays, January also brings interesting discounts for Valentine's Day.\n\nToys:\n\nRetailers can create a sense of urgency for shoppers to purchase new toy arrivals early, because items may not be available later on. However, the best deals typically occur during the first two weeks of December\n\nFitness Equipment:\n\nThere might be a few deals during Black Friday week on fitness equipment, but shoppers should expect these retailers to dive into deeper discounts after the New Year. It's no secret that New Year's resolutions encourage customers to ramp up their workout routines, and stores know it.\n\nSource: Experts at RetailMeNot", "Staff at Amazon are preparing for their busiest Black Friday on record tomorrow. with Britons expected to spend an estimated \u00a38 billion over the weekend.\n\nWorkers at the Peterborough fulfilment centre in Cambridgeshire are getting ready for a frantic festive season of picking and packing, with millions of Britons set to snap up the limited time deals.\n\nAmazon is offering deals on thousands of gifts, with its Black Friday store open until Sunday.\n\nStaff at Amazon's fulfilment centre in Cambridgeshire, pictured, is preparing for the 'busiest black Friday' on record\n\nStaff will be working around the clock as shoppers take advantage of the sales to buy their presents for Christmas\n\nThe company has opened four new warehouses across the country which have created 3,500 new permanent jobs\n\nThere will also be thousands of 'Lightning Deals' on offer with products available at a discount, in limited quantities, for a short period of time.\n\nThis year hundreds of small businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace will also be offering thousands of Black Friday deals.\n\n'Customers tell us they love getting extra low prices so they can save on their Christmas shopping. This year we have hundreds of small businesses from our Marketplace offering great deals on their unique and creative products, making it even easier to find perfect gifts with our Black Friday sale,' said Doug Gurr, Country Manager, Amazon.co.uk.\n\nThis year Amazon has opened four new fulfilment centres in the run-up to Christmas and the sites have created more than 3,500 new permanent jobs.\n\nGayle Hunter, Founder of Luxelu, which sells its own brand of lifestyle products via the Fulfilment by Amazon service, said: 'Black Friday has grown for us year on year, and it's helped us to grow our business by increasing sales and reaching new customers.\n\n'We're expecting this year to be bigger and better than ever before, with more customers discovering our products which helps to build our brand in the UK and across Europe.'\n\nThe Cambridgeshire warehouse is one of four opened by the company employing a total of 3,500 permanent staff\n\nWhen the orders arrive, workers collect the products from the shelves before packing them in a box for delivery\n\nThe products are then loaded onto pallets and into trucks and vans for delivery drivers to complete the process\n\nHowever, despite the hype, seven out of ten Britons believe Black Friday is a marketing ploy.\n\nResearchers found a large percentage of the population are of the opinion the only winners are the big store chains.\n\nAnd according to the study while the average Briton takes advantage of 84 deals each year, for a total annual saving of almost \u00a3220, 65 per cent will resist splashing out on Friday.\n\nBritons prepare to spend a record \u00a37.78bn over Black Friday weekend -

which will see sales of around \u00a32.6 billion.\n\nDuring 2016 shoppers saved on average \u00a3121 by waiting until the last minute before committing their cash.\n\nIn previous years, some shoppers came to blows, such as these in Wembley, north west London as they attempted to by cheap televisons\n\nConsumers need to prepare a plan to secure the best deal and decide whether to try online or in store\n\nDespite the threat of chaotic scenes, most sales will be made in store according to experts at the Voucher Code website\n\nExperts believe high streets and shopping centres will see five per cent more sales than online as retailers slash costs of electronic goods, fashion items and beauty products.\n\nPaul Lewis, Senior Director of Marketing at Voucher Codes said: 'Last year, we saw a 78 per cent increase in the number of visitors to the VoucherCodes website compared to the week prior, showing there's a massive appetite for offers and discount codes over the Black Friday weekend.\n\n'Cyber Monday is often the last day to take advantage of these fantastic offers, so we're not surprised that savvy shoppers are holding out a little longer for the maximum possible discount. This year we'll be helping our customers save even more, by adding a record-breaking number of offers and discount codes to our site; helping people to save money on treating themselves, as well as on gifts for friends and family.'\n\nAccording to Anita Naik, Lifestyle Editor at VoucherCodes, consumers should develop a strategy to secure the best deals.\n\nShe said: 'Black Friday is now one of the biggest shopping days of the year in Britain, which means if you're planning to jump in and do some Christmas shopping you can expect crowds on the high street and busy retail websites. There are ways to get the most out of the day without having to fight it out with fellow shoppers and my number one rule is to be prepared. This means know what you want, know where to get it from and know how to grab it before everyone else.'\n\nMs Naik said looking on a website such as VoucherCodes can cut down on the work.\n\nShe said: 'Set a budget and write a list. The key thing is to know what you want to buy and, most importantly, how much it usually costs.\n\n'It's easy to get drawn in by the discounts on the day, so knowing how much the things you want cost pre-Black Friday is key. If you're the type of person who gets easily swayed into buying things on impulse, make sure you review your available Black Friday budget ahead of the day and stick to it like glue. It may sound boring, but bargains are only bargains if you need them!'\n\nMs Naik said some of the deals go live shortly after midnight, so it might be worth setting an alarm. Also there are online lightening deals.", "It's the biggest shopping day of the year, and there are some amazing deals around this Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the trick is to know where to find them.\n\nFortunately for those of us who don't feel like fighting the crowds, many of the best deals can be found online, and Amazon is among retailers offering huge discounts.

Don't give any website your credit card PIN for any reason and try to buy only from those you know and trust.\n\n2. Don't rush into a decision. If you feel pressurised by a website -- many retailers use tools such as a ticking clock or a 'just one left' banner to make you feel that you need to act swiftly -- then you should take a step back.\n\n3. Do their contact numbers look bona fide? If they have a PO box number rather than a proper address, or they only offer a mobile number or premium-rate '09' phone line, they may be fine -- but if alarm bells ring, don't proceed. If you don't know a brand, be especially cautious.\n\n4. Don't necessarily trust social media -- if it sounds too good to be true on Twitter or WhatsApp, then it probably is!\n\n5.

Internet jokers see the funny side as Britain gears up for the chaotic scramble to grab Black Friday bargains\n\nIt's expected to the biggest ever weekend of shopping in Britain with consumers predicted to spend almost \u00a38billion on deals over the next four days.\n\nAnd internet jokers have already been poking fun at shoppers with a series of tongue-in-cheek memes ahead of the scramble to get a bargain on Black Friday.\n\nSome referenced the fact that Thanksgiving Day takes place hours before in the US, saying: 'Didn't you say you were thankful for everything you had yesterday?'\n\nOthers shared a picture of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow running in Pirates of the Caribbean, saying: 'When somebody gets the last flatscreen TV on Black Friday.'\n\nBritons will spend just under \u00a32.6billion today alone - an 8 per cent increase overall on last year - and \u00a37.8billion over the four-day period including Cyber Monday.", "It is easy to get swept up in the Black Friday madness and end up buying a whole basket of stuff you may not actually need, and perhaps isn't quite as good value as you first thought.\n\nAs more and more companies get in on the Cyber Weekend action savvy consumers can now find deals that won't just pay today, but could save you money all year round.\n\nWe have scoured the web for the top deals to help your personal finances rather than those that drain your bank balance from discounted broadband or car insurance deals to cheap flights or an Avios points boost.\n\nBeat the Black Friday madness: We round up the best deals that could see you saving money all year round\n\nGET AN AVIOS BOOST ON YOUR BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING\n\nIf you collect Avios points it's worth knowing that you can shop through eStore this Black Friday and earn extra airline points.\n\nIf you have an account all you need to do is search for the retailer you want and click through as normal to buy.\n\nAvios is offering double points (typically 4 points per \u00a31) with a bunch of retailers while spends with some shops earn as much as 8 or even 12 Avios per \u00a31.\n\nBuying a new TV from John Lewis for \u00a3500, for example, could earn you 2,000 Avios. You could earn nearly as many Avios from a \u00a3160 coffee machine from Selfridges, as the eStore offers 1,920 points with its current 12 point per \u00a31 promotion with the department store.\n\nIt's list includes the likes of Apple, M&S, Currys and House of Fraser, Tesco Direct and John Lewis all of which have Black Friday and Cyber Weekend promotions on.

Electronics, watches and home goods are their most popular deals this year.\n\nPrice cuts of at least 50 per cent are being promoted on fashions, footwear and household electricals. Some are promising cuts of 75 per cent amid claims of products being sold at a loss just to get them off the shelves.\n\nOne woman appeared to be very happy with her deal on a new microwave at Currys PC World in Luton, Bedfordshire\n\nThese two people carried a new hi-fi system to their car after buying it on Black Friday today at Currys PC World in Luton\n\nFlatscreen televisions were proving to be popular at the Currys PC World in Luton today\n\nBut early online sales between midnight and 7am were down, with research finding that shoppers across the UK were not willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep to make the most of Black Friday discounts this year.\n\nPCA Predict analysts found online sales up to 7am today had fallen by a quarter (24 per cent) compared to 2016, with the highest number of online transactions before breakfast in South East London.\n\nPolice issue Black Friday fraud alert\n\nPolice have warned consumers to be on guard for cyber fraud on the biggest shopping day of the year.\n\nThe public have been urged to 'slow down' and 'think' about the gifts they are buying and who they are purchasing them from.\n\nVictims reported losing nearly \u00a316 million to Christmas shopping fraudsters last year, increasing from \u00a310 million lost the year before.\n\nTrending items they reported losing out on included Yeezy trainers, Kylie Jenner make-up, hair dryers, drones and Fitbit watches.\n\nMobile phones continue to be the most likely thing that people try to buy from fraudsters, with accessories and clothing second and footwear third.\n\nCity of London Police Commander Dave Clark said: 'Christmas is a busy time of year when we are required to make several quick decisions, especially when it comes to present buying.\n\n'Our fraud awareness campaign is highlighting that it is very much 'the thought that counts' especially when it comes to avoiding fraudsters.\n\n'Fraudsters see the Christmas rush as an ideal opportunity to take advantage of people's generosity without a single care about the consequences this may cause for the victim.'\n\nChris Boaz, \u200eHead of Marketing of PCA Predict, said: 'As of this morning, online sales are actually down, compared to last year.\n\n'However, last night there was a huge surge in sales as people tried to beat the morning rush to snap up the best deals. By contrast last year, many consumers shopped from midnight to 7am to bag a bargain.'\n\n'One of the primary reasons for this is due to the extended sales in the run up to Black Friday itself, which showed an increase of 11 per cent meaning consumers aren't as pressed as they once were to shop on the day.'\n\nHowever by lunchtime, PCA Predict found there was a growth of 7 per cent in online sales between 7am and 11am - giving a total fall in sales of only 2 per cent between midnight and 11am.\n\nThe peak time for purchasing in Britain so far today has been 10.58am.\n\nSpending is expected to be up 7 per cent on last year to reach \u00a37.8billion over the four day sales weekend, according to the Centre for Retail Research and VoucherCodes website.\n\nA record number of stores are running deals for fear of losing business to rivals, particularly the online goliath Amazon.\n\nSeveral retailers' websites have been experiencing so much traffic in the past 24 hours that they crashed - with companies including Game, Ted Baker, Next and Calvin Klein all affected, according to analysts.\n\nSimon Wharton, managing director at e-commerce agency PushON, said: 'Last night, before Black Friday even got underway, a number of e-commerce sites had already gone down as they couldn't cope with traffic surges.\n\n'Not long after 9pm, Ted Baker was struggling to meet demand with users temporarily unable to access the site. GAME was also down for about three hours yesterday as the retailer 'updated' its site for Black Friday.\n\n'And Calvin Klein had opted to pay for adverts on Google, yet when users clicked on the ads, they were led to a blank page. This morning, Next was also experiencing issues with its website.'\n\nShoppers were seen pouring into stores including a Tesco Extra in Manchester and a Game at Westfield Stratford in London overnight, but most other outlets were sparsely populated this morning.\n\nWestfield Stratford in East London was looking busy by lunchtime today as people took their time on Black Friday today\n\nBargain hunters gather at Westfield Stratford in East London today to seek out the best deals around lunchtime today\n\nThousands of shoppers tried for a Black Friday deal today, with a main road in Edinburgh pictured this afternoon\n\nGordon McKinnon, operations director at shopping centre owner Intu, said: 'Because it doesn't immediately follow a big public holiday like Thanksgiving, Black Friday has a completely different shape over here than it does in in the US.\n\n'It has evolved in the UK from a one day event to be a longer affair, as retailers stretch out the sales period to help spread activity over a longer time frame. So, Black Friday has a more relaxed feel in the UK, as shoppers visit stores at their leisure before numbers pick up later in the day and reach a peak this evening.\n\nHe added: 'If previous years' patterns are anything to go by, we're expecting the day to get busier and hit a peak this evening when those finishing work will join the hunt for deals. By the end of the today, we should have seen well above one million shoppers through our doors.\n\nMany retailers have been offering bargains ahead of Black Friday and the cuts were stepped up overnight. As a result, millions of people were shopping through the night from their beds on phones and laptops.\n\nBut some analysts and industry leaders warn that, in some cases, the price cuts amount to a disastrous exercise in self-harm.\n\nApart from potentially selling items at a loss, there is a huge cost around delivering items bought online and then handling returns. Evidence of the difficulties emerged yesterday with news that two chains, the furniture retailer Multiyork, and the shoe business Shoon, are in trouble.\n\nA handful of keen bargain hunters try their luck as Tesco at Kingston Park in Newcastle-upon-Tyne opens its doors at 5am\n\nBlack Friday on Oxford Street at 8am today, with very few shoppers on what is expected to be the year's biggest shopping day\n\nPeople exit Oxford Circus London Underground station today, with the area much quieter than retailers would have hoped\n\nMultiyork, which has 50 shops and a factory, has gone into administration and Shoon, which has six shops and concessions in department stores, has filed notice of its intention to appoint administrators although it may be sold.\n\nThe Christmas period is make or break for most retailers and the Black Friday sales, which have been imported from America, have turned traditional shopping patterns on their head.\n\nThe relatively warm autumn means fashion retailers are looking to offload masses of unsold coats, boots and woollens.\n\nIndustry data has shown a slump in sales of furniture and household electricals, everything from washing machines to TVs, where there will be particularly big reductions.\n\nJames Brown of pricing and promotions experts, Simon-Kucher, warned: 'Black Friday is now a real retail experience and shoppers love getting out to find a bargain.\n\n'But for some businesses they will slash prices so much that they accidentally turn the day into their most disastrous day of the year.\n\n'We've reviewed thousands of promotions by hundreds of businesses, and we're confident that many businesses will make dramatically less than they expect out of cutting prices on Black Friday.\n\n'Some will even make a loss, although many won't actually realise it as the sales numbers look good at first glance. One business we examined recently had the unwelcome realisation that roughly half of all their promotions were loss making.'\n\nShoppers rush into a Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester, moments after security guards open the doors at 5am today\n\nTwo shoppers carry a Toshiba TV together at the Tesco store in Gorton, Manchester, this morning as Black Friday begins\n\nA police officer monitors shoppers at the Tesco in Gorton (left) as one man carries a TV at a Tesco in Stockport (right)\n\nShoppers wait outside Game at Westfield Stratford in East London after the video game retailer opened its doors at midnight\n\nBargain hunters stayed up late to make it to the midnight opening of Game in Stratford. Shoppers will spend nearly \u00a38billion this weekend\n\nShoppers queue up outside an H&M store on Oxford Street in London's West End on Black Friday at 6am this morning\n\nRespected retail analyst, Richard Hyman, described Black Friday as 'crazy' in terms of damaging store profits. 'Much of the trade would love to opt out but in this weakest of all retail markets, few have succeeded,' he said.\n\n'With demand thin and consumer confidence brittle, Black Friday will essentially suck Christmas sales forward. For Amazon it's a stick with which to beat much of the industry.'\n\nThe boss of the Fat Face clothing chain, Anthony Thompson, who refuses to take part in Black Friday, described the sales as 'ludicrous'.\n\nHe said: 'If you're a clothing brand or gifting retailer, you don't want to discount at the wrong time. It's ludicrous to suggest it's a good idea in clothing.\n\n'UK clothing is on its knees and it's killing itself. We're weakening our proposition and encouraging people to buy on price.'\n\nSome estimates suggest the Black Friday weekend will hoover up 40 per cent of all spending on Christmas. Amazon was at the forefront of bringing the American sale event to the UK in 2010.\n\nIn the US, Black Friday comes on the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Asda, which is owned by Wal-mart of the USA, initially pushed the event.\n\nWorkers try to keep up with demand at the Amazon fulfilment centre near Doncaster in South Yorkshire today\n\nAmazon said in the first six hours of Black Friday it had sold more than 63,000 toys and 32,000 beauty products\n\nSome of Amazon's best-selling items included the Nintendo Switch, a Bosch cordless drill and a Lego Ninjago Movie toy\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\n'Get clean and sober' Sharon Osbourne on Meghan Markle's father\n\nWatch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nBritish diver involved in Thai soccer team rescue feared the worst\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nBeaming Prince Harry and Meghan open Nelson Mandela exhibition\n\nWatch video\n\n'My view has not changed' FBI Director Chris Wray on Russia\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave lion cub forced to jump into raging river to follow mother\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nLabradoodle is a scardy cat when it comes to escalators\n\nBritons prepare to spend a record \u00a37.78bn over Black Friday weekend - with in store sales still set to beat online giants Sale type Black Friday Sat/Sun Cyber Monday 2017 total 2016 total YoY % Difference UK online \u00a31.15bn \u00a30.71bn \u00a31.27bn \u00a33.13bn \u00a32.79bn 12% UK offline \u00a31.45bn \u00a31.87bn \u00a31.33bn \u00a34.65bn \u00a34.49bn 4% Total \u00a32.59bn \u00a32.58bn \u00a32.60bn \u00a37.78bn \u00a37.28bn 7% Source: VoucherCodes\n\nHowever it scaled back involvement after ugly scenes at stores as people pushed and fought over cheap TVs.\n\nMore recently, retailers like Argos, which launched deeper Black Friday cuts at 9pm last night, John Lewis and the other major department stores have championed the event. And now, virtually all the chains and independents are offering deals.\n\nResearch by accountants PwC suggest half of adults will buy something in the sales with the average spend up from \u00a3170 last year to \u00a3200.\n\nConsumer Markets leader at PwC, Lisa Hooker, said: 'Technology and electrical items are in demand this Black Friday weekend. Retailers who specialise in these areas can't afford not to have a Black Friday promotion in the UK - it's here to stay.\n\n'UK shoppers are increasingly willing to part with their money on Black Friday and we expect the fastest spending growth to come from younger shoppers, who are more likely to purchase on impulse.'\n\nExperts warned the sales were not good for stores. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said Black Friday doesn't increase sales, it simply means spending happens earlier, adding: 'It forces retailers to sell their goods at discounted prices earlier and for longer.\n\n'Shoppers have become accustomed to reduced price tags, with retailers all too happy to accommodate their demands for fear of being overlooked. Clearly this is not sustainable.'\n\nHe added that retailers faced huge costs in dealing with deliveries and returns.\n\nThe fact that Next is running deals of up to 70 per cent off for the first time is also seen by some as a sign of how shops feel they have no choice but to offer discounts.\n\nDouglas Ker, of the handbag firm Meli Melo, said: 'Brands feel forced to participate in this sales bonanza. Discounting across the industry has gone wild.'\n\nHOW TO SECURE YOUR PERFECT BLACK FRIDAY DEAL\n\nConsumers will spend seven per cent more this year over Black Friday compared with 2016 according to new research from VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) with more than \u00a37.8 billion worth of goods set to be sold.\n\nHowever, savvy shoppers looking for electronics might want to save their cash until Cyber Monday - which will see sales of around \u00a32.6 billion.\n\nDuring 2016 shoppers saved on average \u00a3121 by waiting until the last minute before committing their cash.\n\nExperts believe high streets and shopping centres will see five per cent more sales than online as retailers slash costs of electronic goods, fashion items and beauty products.\n\nPaul Lewis, Senior Director of Marketing at Voucher Codes said: 'Last year, we saw a 78 per cent increase in the number of visitors to the VoucherCodes website compared to the week prior, showing there's a massive appetite for offers and discount codes over the Black Friday weekend.\n\n'Cyber Monday is often the last day to take advantage of these fantastic offers, so we're not surprised that savvy shoppers are holding out a little longer for the maximum possible discount. This year we'll be helping our customers save even more, by adding a record-breaking number of offers and discount codes to our site; helping people to save money on treating themselves, as well as on gifts for friends and family.'\n\nIn previous years, some shoppers came to blows, such as these in Wembley, north west London as they attempted to by cheap televisons\n\nConsumers need to prepare a plan to secure the best deal and decide whether to try online or in store\n\nAccording to Anita Naik, Lifestyle Editor at VoucherCodes, consumers should develop a strategy to secure the best deals.\n\nShe said: 'Black Friday is now one of the biggest shopping days of the year in Britain, which means if you're planning to jump in and do some Christmas shopping you can expect crowds on the high street and busy retail websites. There are ways to get the most out of the day without having to fight it out with fellow shoppers and my number one rule is to be prepared. This means know what you want, know where to get it from and know how to grab it before everyone else.'\n\nMs Naik said looking on a website such as VoucherCodes can cut down on the work.\n\nShe said: 'Set a budget and write a list. The key thing is to know what you want to buy and, most importantly, how much it usually costs.\n\n'It's easy to get drawn in by the discounts on the day, so knowing how much the things you want cost pre-Black Friday is key. If you're the type of person who gets easily swayed into buying things on impulse, make sure you review your available Black Friday budget ahead of the day and stick to it like glue. It may sound boring, but bargains are only bargains if you need them!'\n\nMs Naik said some of the deals go live shortly after midnight, so it might be worth setting an alarm. Also there are online lightening deals.\n\nDespite the threat of chaotic scenes, most sales will be made in store according to experts at the Voucher Code website\n\nGet a REAL deal this Black Friday: About to splash out?

Smaller hardware firms lack the market share to significantly affect Google's business, the person said.\n\nGoogle also can continue to pay hardware makers to be the exclusive search provider, the business from which it derives most of its revenue, on a device-by-device basis. The EU did not specify any limits on Google's ability to outbid smaller players in search such as DuckDuckGo.\n\nGoogle is \"systematically set to continue to dominate the industry,\" said Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft's mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital.\n\nThe ruling should give smartphone makers the ability to develop phones based on Fire OS, a version of Android customised and distributed by Amazon, the EU press statements said.\n\nGoogle has allowed third parties to make such \"forks\" of Android, as they are termed in the industry, but it limited their adoption through licensing restrictions, the EU found.\n\nThe issue remains, though, that the EU did not specify that Google must provide its apps to smartphones with \"forks\", meaning that Fire OS phones could continue to lack services such as Google Maps, industry analysts said.\n\nThe omission leaves the industry with an \"observation\" rather than offering a \"prescription\" that puts the forks on equal footing, said Kumar Shah, managing director at investment firm Transit Capital and a former leader at Indian smartphone maker Micromax.\n\nInstead, the EU said Google could maintain \"fair and objective\" restrictions on devices to which it does supply apps.\n\nSmartphone vendors who try to adopt forks may also not be welcome by wireless carriers, who are focused on the rollout of high-speed 5G networks and do not want \"handset makers distracted by side issues,\" Fogg said.\n\nGoogle must stop the illegal practices within 90 days to avoid fines, or it can seek a delay of the order while it appeals. Google has not said how it would adjust practices if it loses the appeal nor whether it would make changes in the EU only or globally.", "If you're rocking an Android phone from the likes of Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and other major brands, its screen is likely protected by Corning's Gorilla Glass. The company's just unveiled the latest version of its protective composition, which is said to be twice as effective as Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nThe US-based firm says that Gorilla Glass 6 can survive 15 drops from a height of one meter onto rough surfaces - a lot more than the average of four phone drops a year among users that the company recorded in a study this year.\n\nCorning chalks up the enhanced durability to a higher level of compression than was possible with Gorilla Glass 5. Between bezel-less displays and the growing trend of glass backs on phones, any additional protection we can get is welcome.\n\nExpect to see Gorilla Glass 6 on new devices sometime next year; it's currently in testing and will continue to be for the next several months. I wouldn't count on going case-less with my next phone, though; I'm paranoid like that.", "NEW DELHI (BLOOMBERG) - Despite a sleek marketing campaign, the world isn't quite ready to 'Make in India'.\n\nLast week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in celebrated the inauguration of what Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. called the world's largest mobile phone factory.\n\nAt the splashy event just outside New Delhi, Modi said the facility was \"extremely important\" for his Make in India initiative to boost manufacturing to 25 per cent of India's economy by 2020 and create millions of jobs.\n\nSamsung said the plant was a \"shining example\" of the success of the programme.\n\nBut the investment is more the exception than the norm. Data from the World Bank and the Reserve Bank of India show manufacturing hasn't received a significant boost since Modi took office in 2014.\n\nWhile India's economy has overtaken France to become the world's sixth largest, manufacturing has shrunk to about 15 per cent of gross domestic product from a peak of 18.6 per cent in 1995, according to the World Bank.\n\nOther data show new investments in India have dropped and stalled projects are on the rise.\n\n\"The Samsung announcement is good news, but it must be seen as a one-off at present,\" says Vivek Dehejia, an associate professor of economics at Carleton University in Ottawa. \"Make in India is a noble aspiration of the Modi government. Yet, in the absence of a supporting infrastructure and ease of doing business environment, it's a tough challenge.\"\n\nThe initiative is a worthwhile attempt to lure global businesses, analysts say, but it hasn't been accompanied by enough meaningful changes to revive manufacturing or alter what is essentially a services-oriented economy.\n\nMade in China\n\nSpokesmen for the Prime Minister's Office and the commerce ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnlike Beijing's Made in China 2025 programme - which targets strategic industries from robotics to new-energy vehicles through state investment and subsidies - Modi's Make in India plan is more of an investment promotion strategy.\n\nOne of the key reforms under the initiative launched in 2014 was the loosening up of foreign investment restrictions in several sectors, including defence.\n\nHowever, private data shows investment is falling. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show new project investments have dropped to 6.62 trillion rupees (S$131.5 billion) in the financial year ended March from 18.7 trillion rupees in fiscal 2015.\n\nOver-Capacity\n\nThe value of stalled projects climbed to 7.63 trillion rupees from 5.29 trillion during that period. Even data from the Reserve Bank of India's bulletin show that corporate capital expenditure has fallen since Modi came to power.\n\nModi's Make in India project hasn't worked, in part because Indian companies invested heavily for years until 2012, well before Modi's election, and now have excess industrial capacity, said Mahesh Vyas, CMIE's chief executive officer.\n\n\"It now needs to wait for these capacities to be absorbed fully before new capacities are built aggressively again,\" Vyas said.\n\nHe added \"the world has become a lot more protectionist and is more keen to retain employment on its shores than exporting these to other countries.\"\n\nThose capacities have done little to temper growth in imports of foreign-made goods. Rising purchases of smartphones and TVs have made electronics India's second-biggest import item after oil, and is pushing the nation's trade deficit wider.\n\nUnder Modi, record foreign direct investment has flowed into India and the country's ease of doing business ranking has improved. Most investment, such as Amazon.com Inc.'s US$5 billion commitment to expand operations in India, has gone into the nation's dominant services and technology industries.\n\nFDI remains just 1.2 per cent of India's overall investment, according to Bloomberg Economics analyst Abhishek Gupta. High-profile investments from foreign firms \"should not be confused with an overall improvement in investment activity in India,\" he said.\n\nWith more jobs created in the services sector, Modi's programme should focus on investments there, said Gupta.\n\n\"Job creation in India could hugely benefit if Make in India's focus is expanded to include more services, relative to its overemphasis on manufacturing,\" Gupta said. \"India's tough labour laws and higher bureaucratic entry barriers into manufacturing, along with its widespread fluency in English - a boon in global services - suggests that its comparative advantage lies in services.\"\n\nEven the Make in India programme's mascot - a lion composed of gears - hasn't avoided the onerous regulations and occasional political interference that are still common in India and a key obstacle to investment.\n\nA large lion statue, built by one of India's state-owned companies to promote the manufacturing programme, reportedly ran afoul of rules when it was placed outside the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in New Delhi.\n\nAnd a separate branding exercise involving colorful lion structures in Mumbai led to accusations they violated local heritage regulations.\n\n\"Manufacturing's share of GDP continues to stagnate in India as in other major economies. One large deal will not change that overnight,\" Dehejia said.", "Corning has unveiled Gorilla Glass 6 as an all-new glass protection for mobile devices. As the successor to Gorilla Glass 5 that was launched back in July 2016, the new development is touted to be designed with an \"entirely new material\" that helps withstand multiple drops. The Corning, New York-based company emphasises that the new glass protection is its most durable cover glass to date. While the company hasn't revealed the devices featuring the new glass panel, it has confirmed that the latest creation is currently being evaluated by multiple customers - suggesting its debut sometime in the next coming months. The next-generation Galaxy Note that is scheduled to arrive on August 9 could emerge as the first handset featuring Gorilla Glass 6.\n\nIn lab tests, Corning claims that Gorilla Glass 6 survived as many as 15 drops from 1-metre height onto rough surfaces and was found to be up to two times better than Gorilla Glass 5. The company has used a new glass composition to make the fresh Gorilla Glass version capable of withstanding multiple drops. \"Gorilla Glass 6 is an entirely new glass composition that can be chemically strengthened to give it significantly higher levels of compression than is possible with Gorilla Glass 5,\" said Dr. Jaymin Amin, Vice President of Technology and Product Development, Corning Gorilla Glass and Corning Specialty Materials, in a press statement while announcing the new panel. \"This enables Gorilla Glass 6 to be more resistant to damage. Moreover, with breaks during drops being a probabilistic event, the added compression helps increase, on average, the likelihood of survival through multiple drop events.\"\n\nAlongside offering an enhanced durability, Gorilla Glass 6 is designed with optimised \"optical clarity, touch sensitivity, scratch resistance, efficient wireless charging and enhanced durability\" to match modern design trends where glass panels are featured not just at the front but also at the back. Corning believes that modern smartphone designs use glass for more than 85 percent of the enclosure. This is where the newest Gorilla Glass panel helps.\n\n\"With both its aesthetic and performance advantages, glass is on the right side of the technology curve and will continue to be the material of choice for mobile consumer electronics,\" said Scott Forester, Division Vice President, Marketing and Innovation Products, Corning Gorilla Glass, in the statement.\n\nCorning says that Gorilla Glass 6 is expected \"to reach the market in the next several months.\" While the list of devices featuring the panel is yet to be revealed, the Galaxy Note 9 is likely to be the first model with the latest Gorilla Glass panel. Back in 2016, Samsung brought the Galaxy Note 7 as the first device to feature Gorilla Glass 5.", "Samsung is working on an Android Go edition phone to launch in India (and other markets) very soon. Until now, rumours were that the Samsung Android Go device will be the Galaxy J2. But now, the Bluetooth certification site reveals that the phone will actually be called Galaxy J2 Core and not Galaxy J2. With the Galaxy J2 Core, Samsung will most likely aim to compete with other existing Android Go phones in the Indian market, like the Nokia 1.\n\nAs also rumoured earlier, Samsung's Android Go edition phone will come in as many as seven variants. The Bluetooth certification site also reveals the same. According to the Bluetooth certification listing, the Samsung Android Go phone or Galaxy J2 Core will come with SM-J260F, SM-J260M, SM-J260Y, SM-J260F_DS, SM-J260G_DS, SM-J260M_DS, and SM-J260Y_DS model numbers. The specs and prices of all the seven variants will vary from each other. The certification site didn't reveal any specification details about the Android Go phone from Samsung.\n\nThe launch timeline of the Samsung's Android Go edition phone aka Galaxy J2 Core is yet to be officially revealed by the company. Some reports suggest that Samsung may announce its Android Go edition phone later this year, while some say it may get postponed to next year.\n\nSamsung is expected to launch the Galaxy J2 Core in other markets apart from its home. The key markets for the Galaxy J2 Core are likely to be India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Alongside these markets, the Android Go smartphone is likely to debut in the UK, Uzbekistan, Germany, Italy, Russia, and France among others markets.\n\nThe Android Go phone was spotted on the Geekbench benchmarking site a couple of weeks ago. The benchmark listing revealed almost the complete specs of the phone. The listing reveals that the Galaxy J2 Core will come with a 5-inch Super AMOLED display. The phone will be powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos 7570 SoC paired with 1GB RAM and 16GB storage. On the camera front, the Galaxy J2 Core will come with a single camera setup on both back and front panel.\n\nALSO READ: This is Samsung Android Go phone, will not run stock Android\n\nOn the rear panel, the phone will consist of an 8-megapixel sensor, while on the front the Galaxy J2 Core will sport a 5-megapixel sensor for selfies. The phone will be backed by a 2600mAh battery. On the software front, the Galaxy J2 Core will run Android 8.1 Oreo (Go edition) with Samsung Experience UX on top, meaning, no stock Android for the Samsung Android Go phone. Running on Android Go software means the phone will come preloaded with slimmed down apps like Google Go, Maps Go, and YouTube Go.", "Global Bluetooth Earphone Market Research Report 2018 contains historic data that spans 2013 to 2016, and then continues to forecast to 2025.

It gives you access to the entire operating system and allows you to customize any aspect of it. This involves removal of built in apps, customizing with mods and roms, and overclocking or under clocking the processor.\n\nKnox is an in built feature in every Samsung phone that restricts the user to gain access to the operating system. The feature was first launched with Galaxy Note 3 and since then it has become a regular feature of Samsung devices. The Knox feature has components that do not allow the root applications to work. The Knox has a default value of 0 and when you try to root the device it changes to 0x1.

A Rosenblatt analyst has predicted that the lower-end 8S model could launch with color options, including blue, yellow and pink\n\nThe iPhone 5C was released in multiple colors, but did not have as many options for subsequent releases.\n\nZhang also speculates that Apple may shift to a three rear camera approach for the 2019 major iPhone release.\n\nA research note from Yuanta Securities says Apple could launch an iPhone with three rear 12-megapixel cameras and optical image stabilization, which helps to make photos less blurry and produces smoother video footage.\n\nYuanta Securities drew that conclusion after conversations with Apple supplier Largan Precision, which produces smartphone lenses for the tech giant.\n\nThey predict that if Apple decides to release a triple-camera iPhone, that other smartphone vendors like Samsung and Huawei will likely follow suit.\n\nCurrently, the iPhone X and the iPhone 8 Plus come with dual 12mp rear cameras.\n\nA triple-lens camera could be used for a variety of applications, such as enhancing low-light image quality.\n\nLast month, a report from the Taiwan's Economic Daily News said Apple is working on a phone with three rear cameras for 2019.\n\nIt noted that the firm wants to build a camera system with three 12mp rear lenses, citing industry sources as confirmation.\n\nWHAT ARE THE 2018 iPHONE RUMOURS SO FAR?\n\nApple has yet to unveil the iPhone 8, but the latest rumours of its 2018 smartphone have already hit the web.\n\nIn August rumours from the supply chain said the iPhone 9 will be available in two sizes, including one with a massive screen that would be Apple's biggest yet.\n\nThe 'Plus' size will reportedly have a 6.46-inch screen and will be sold alongside a smaller 5.85-inch model in a bid to compete with Samsung's Galaxy Note.\n\nThe leak came from a source within Samsung Display, the sole OLED supplier for the upcoming iPhones.\n\nThe source also said the smaller version was originally going to be a 5.28-inch model but that the firm upped it to 5.85 inches because of growing consumer demand for bigger-screen phones.\n\nIn August rumours from the supply chain said the iPhone 9 will be available in two sizes, including one with a massive screen that would be Apple's biggest yet (stock image, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus)\n\nA recent Apple leak suggested the firm could cancel the iPhone X.\n\nAn analyst says the new model's disappointing sales could lead to the phone being cancelled -

So it is impossible for Apple to be the same. But I think his value is there, and brilliant people are there, so things move forward.

Might be the same size as a small tablet when unfolded\n\nThe Galaxy X, as it has been nicknamed, will reportedly be 7 inches diagonally when unfolded.\n\nThat is about the same size as a small tablet, giving more screen space than a traditional smartphone, in a smaller package.\n\nWhen the screen is folded in half \"like a wallet\", there is a smaller display screen on the front and cameras on the back, according to the Journal.\n\nSamsung's patents and prototypes show a device that either opens and closes from side to side like a book, or horizontally like a notepad.\n\nChina's Huawei bets on AI phone in challenge to Apple, Samsung\n\nEither way, the fold will make it possible to incorporate bigger display options.\n\nIt might also give users the option to split the screen into two panels that show different things or show one big picture, similar to what Samsung accomplished with its 48-inch ultra-wide computer monitor - but that is still speculation.\n\nDepending on the material of the outside layer, a smartphone that folds on itself could serve as its own screen protector.\n\nHowever, the fold might create new durability issues, as Samsung executive DongJin Koh hinted earlier this year.\n\nSamsung 5G launch targets Chinese rival Hauwei\n\n\"We want to have a good reaction from customers once the phone is out in the market,\" he said in January. \"But there are still durability issues that we need to address.\"\n\nPushing two screens against each other might cause a harsher impact on collision.\n\nAn additional concern with the amount of screen space is that using multiple screens - meaning the ones on the outside and the inside - are more likely to make the battery overheat.\n\n3. The Galaxy X could be bulkier than most smartphones\n\nMost smartphone manufacturers have spent years making slimmer devices - and a foldable smartphone could be like adding a layer to a thin phone or stacking two thin phones on top of each other.\n\nThe ZTE Axon M, marketed as the first foldable smartphone, is made of two displays attached by a mechanical hinge - but it is almost 1.5x thicker than Samsung's Galaxy S9.\n\nIf the size of the display is comparable to that of a tablet, we can assume the device will be closer in weight to a tablet, too.\n\n4. It will be expensive, with an expected price of US$1,500 or more for two premium screens\n\nSamsung's most expensive phone, an unlocked Galaxy Note 8, costs about US$960.\n\nNew display technologies tend to make smartphones more expensive.\n\nConsumers have seen Samsung's curved-display smartphones steadily rising in price.\n\nThe starting price of the newest iPhone, too, has gone from US$640 to US$1,000, partly because Apple switched from an LCD (liquid crystal display) to an OLED display.\n\nEditor's picks: the best new phones at Mobile World Congress 2018\n\nThe multiple screens will also require a larger battery to prevent the aforementioned overheating and more powerful processing chips.\n\nIf memory and storage capacity increase, that will mean an even bigger price tag.\n\n5. As well as screen-on-screen and overheating concerns, the Galaxy X will have unknown issues\n\nNew technologies almost always have issues that do not come up until the product is on the market, at which point millions of consumers use it and voice their opinions about things that might have been overlooked in testing.\n\nThere could be issues with the phone's main feature, its foldable display, but the layout will probably also influence a lot of other aspects of the phone, such as battery life, memory and appearance.\n\n6. Samsung's edge panel could become obsolete with a foldable Galaxy X\n\nSamsung will probably lose its signature curved-edge display on the Galaxy X, so that it can properly close on itself.\n\nChina's Huawei bets on AI phone to rival Apple and Samsung\n\nSince the edge display is where shortcuts and quick functions are housed, it might not even be necessary on a screen with more real estate.\n\nPlus, as it is right now, the edge display cannot be used simultaneously with the main screen; multitasking would be better on a foldable phone.\n\n7. There will be limited availability to start, with a broader release later in the year\n\nLimited availability is a tactic that has worked for Samsung.\n\nIn 2013, Samsung released the Galaxy Round - its first attempt at a smartphone with a curved display - to a few select Asian markets so it could learn from its mistakes and impress a larger population.\n\nThe following year it released the Galaxy Note Edge, which had a single curved edge.\n\nIt wound up serving as the blueprint for every curved-display device on the market.\n\nIt is not a bad tactic, considering the scrutiny the foldable phone will face, but it does mean that the chances of seeing it sooner rather than later, at least in the United States, are slim.", "SEOUL, July 19 (Yonhap) -- The Bank of Korea (BOK) said Thursday that it has chosen 31 local and foreign financial institutions allowed to participate in the central bank's open market operations starting next month.\n\nSeoul-based Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank and Hana Bank, as well as the local offices of Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas Bank, were among the 18 selected banks, along with 13 non-bank organizations, including Samsung Securities Co. and Mirae Asset Daewoo.\n\nThe BOK said they will become eligible to buy and sell government securities like the market stabilization bond in the open market on Aug. 1 for a year.\n\nOpen market operations are part of the central bank's efforts to manage the market liquidity and short-term interest rates through controlling the supply of reserve balances held by financial firms.", "European regulators came down hard on another U.S. tech giant Wednesday, fining Google a record $5 billion for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine, the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted .\n\nGoogle has 90 days to put remedies in place regardless of its appeal -- which could involve unbundling key apps and allowing Android handset manufacturers to sell devices using altered versions of Android.\n\nMozilla Foundation, the non-profit group that creates the lightweight ad-blocking browser Firefox Focus, said the ruling gives it the opportunity to displace Chrome as the default browser in some phones. It has been in talks with manufacturers from Huawei to Samsung about that.\n\nThe ruling creates \"a huge opportunity,\" Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief operating officer, said Wednesday.\n\nIt's also possible not much will change. Google Search, Chrome and the Play Store are popular with consumers and developers. Handset manufacturers could choose them despite unbundling.\n\n\"It's possible phone manufacturers won't actually take advantage of the newfound freedom they have,\" said Thomas Vinje, lead lawyer for FairSearch, the Brussels-based lobbying group backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and others that was the main complainant in the case. \"It at least opens up the possibility.\"\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe ruling could stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand. Still, some U.S. politicians welcomed it.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and should lead U.S. enforcers to protect consumers. Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nRegardless of the pending appeal, failure to come up with remedies to rectify the behavior after 90 days risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nNeither fine will cripple the company. Google parent Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is technically an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS by a wide margin.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nBoth Amazon and Samsung, maker of the popular Galaxy line of phones, declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nGoogle argues that downloads are easy and while the inclusion of its suite of apps help phones run well out of the box, competitors' apps are a tap away.\n\nIt also argues that not supporting so-called \"forked\" versions of Android ensures a baseline of experience across some 24,000 different models of Android devices. Vestager called the compatibility argument a \"smokescreen.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the U.S. presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.", "Google isn't the only tech giant with anticompetitive practices.\n\nThe European Commission had solid antitrust reasons for fining Google 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) for violations including the bundling of certain apps with the Android operating system -- and for not going after Apple for similar behavior. Yet, from a consumer's point of view, Apple should get the same kind of attention.\n\nThe most important infraction by Google in the EU ruling is the \"illegal tying\" of its search and browser apps to the Android operating system. The search giant, the ruling said, made Android phone manufacturers preinstall its search and browser applications if they wanted to provide access to the Google Play Store, where almost all Android users get their apps. That, according to the European Commission, reduced the ability of other search providers and browser developers to compete because preinstallation creates a \"status-quo bias\": Users are too lazy to research alternatives to apps that are already on their new phones.\n\nThe commission ruled that the bundling practices were illegal because of Google's dominance in the markets of \"licensable smart mobile operating systems and app stores for the Android mobile operating system.\" The language matters because Apple (or Blackberry) doesn't license its operating systems to equipment manufacturers. It produces a full package and cannot be accused of putting illegal pressure on manufacturers. It makes intuitive sense for the EU to refrain from punishing Apple, too: If a product wholly belongs to a company, it can decide what to wrap into it.\n\nBut if Google is at fault for its de facto monopoly in Android app stores, Apple should be held to account for a similar violation. Although an Android user can easily shop in a few alternative stores (though none is a match for the Google Play Store), an iPhone user cannot go outside Apple's App Store without \"jailbreaking\" the phone, a process that disables operating system updates. That makes Apple a monopoly in the truest sense of the word, and the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a suit challenging this super-dominant position on behalf of consumers who have no choice but to pay Apple's 30 percent commission for developers as part of every app's price.\n\nLike Google, Apple makes its preinstalled browser impossible to delete from a phone. Google, however, allows users to choose their own default applications, including the browser and maps. Apple doesn't do that; you can, for example, install Google's Chrome browser and Google Maps on an iPhone, but they won't launch by default when you click on a link in an email or another app. That's even more anticompetitive than simply preinstalling one's own software and hoping users will keep it because it's good enough.\n\nIndeed, Chrome's market share on mobile devices is smaller than Android's. Apple is more effective at keeping competitors out: Its Safari browser holds almost the same market share as its iOS operating system.\n\nAs a consumer, I'd like all phone makers, whether their gadgets run Android, the iOS, Samsung's Tizen, Linux or something even more exotic, to offer me a choice of apps. When setting up a new phone, users should see a list of browser apps, with ratings from users and independent reviewers, along with a list of email applications and mapping and navigation apps. The lazier users could just hit a button for installing all the apps recommended by the operating-system producer.\n\nThe experience of Microsoft, which was forced by the EU to give users a choice of browsers on Windows computers (it was fined twice for not doing so) shows that letting people decide for themselves creates a level playing field for competition. Chrome, and not a Microsoft-developed program, is now the most popular browser on Windows.\n\nIndependent developers are capable of producing better apps than those created by the big platform companies. They deserve a boost from a universal preinstallation ban. And the platform companies, too, can only benefit from more competition: It'll keep them in shape as app developers.\n\nIt's understandable that Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, didn't go for a complete ban on preinstalling basic apps on mobile phones. Trying to regulate giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Intel, which have all received antitrust fines from the EU in the last 10 years, requires a lot of resources. The companies fight back with all their lobbying might, and appeal every ruling against them. Vestager has to concentrate on areas where she's on the most solid ground, and going for major behavior changes in an entire industry probably would be too ambitious. On Wednesday, she said repeatedly that it wasn't her business to tell Google what to do, just to punish it for illegal behavior.\n\nAnd yet there is a case to be made for regulatory interference in app preinstallation practices. European companies are unlikely to become operating system leaders in the foreseeable future. But Europe does have a sizable app economy: In 2017, it employed 1.89 million people, compared with 1.73 million in the U.S. Giving this industry easier access to consumers should be a goal for European policy makers and regulators. Vestager's latest Google ruling should be just a first step, not an isolated attack on one U.S. company for something others do, too."]}, "BASF": {"2018-07-19": ["By Nathan Allen\n\nBASF SE (BAS.XE) said Thursday that it will invest $25 million in Belgian 3D printing company Materialise, less than a month after buying two other companies in the sector.\n\nMaterialise will work with BASF as a research-and-development partner to help bring materials and software for 3D printing to market more quickly, BASF said.\n\nThe German chemical company recently acquired Setup Performance SAS and Advanc3D Materials GmbH, which manufacture materials used in 3D printing, for an undisclosed sum.\n\n\"3D printing is a transformational technology that holds the potential to revolutionize entire industries,\" BASF said.\n\nWrite to Nathan Allen at [email protected]", "BASF and Belgian company Materialise strengthen cooperation Chemical company invests US$25 million in supplier of 3D printing technologies\n\nLudwigshafen/Germany, Leuven/Belgium - July 19, 2018 - BASF is expanding its cooperation with Materialise, a leading supplier of 3D printing technologies.

Amazon is set to rake in $258.22 billion in US retail sales in 2018, while annual growth has jumped 29.2% year-over-year, reports Tech Crunch.\n\nFueling Amazon's rise is a robust network of third-party sellers and a rapidly expanding range of goods from groceries to fashion - made all the more attractive for subscribers of their Prime services.\n\nNow, it is fast approaching a tipping point where more people will be spending money online with Amazon, than with all other retailers -- combined. Amazon's next-closest competitor, eBay, a very, very distant second at 6.6 percent, and Apple in third at 3.9 percent.

And that technique -- known as \"spear phishing -- remains a threat not just to campaign officials but to employees and consumers.\n\nSpear phishing is a scam in which cyber criminals pose as trusted sources and send phony electronic messages to targeted individuals to trick them into revealing sensitive information.\n\nIn the case of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, it was a misleading email that looked like a security notification from Google, asking Podesta to change his password by clicking an embedded link, according to the indictment filed Friday. Podesta followed the email's instructions, changing his password and giving hackers access to 50,000 of his emails.\n\nBut spear fishing could come in the form of an email that appears to come from your boss, asking you to send your W2 form. Or a message with an expected invoice, requesting that you wire the money to an account controlled by bad actors.\n\n\"The indictment really illustrates the many uses this technology can be put,\" said Edward McAndrew, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor and co-leader of Ballard Spahr's privacy and data security group in Philadelphia. \"It's not just about stealing someone's personal information. It's about financial fraud, or in this instance, even election fraud.\"\n\nHow it's done\n\nIn typical phishing scams, cybercriminals send blanket emails to a large swath of users, hoping someone will take the bait and download an infected attachment or click a link to a phony website.\n\nSpear phishing scams, by contrast, are tailored to specific targets. Hackers will research an individual ahead of time, scanning social media accounts and public information to learn a person's job, friends or interests to craft a trustworthy email.\n\n\"They'll figure out where you work and who your colleagues are and try to send a fake email that looks like it's from one of your colleagues,\" said Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and founder of Paoli-based DuckDuckGo, an internet search engine that doesn't track or store user data.\n\nThat's what happened Tuesday at Weinberg's company. One of his employees received an email from a sender using Weinberg's name asking, \"I need you to help run a task. Let me know if you're unoccupied,\" according to a copy of the message. The sender posing as Weinberg wanted to \"gift out some Apple Gift Cards to some clients.\" Weinberg and his colleague didn't bite.\n\nThe person pretending to be Weinberg used an email address that wasn't even close to resembling the real thing. But Michael Levy, the chief of computer crimes for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia, said cyber criminals will typically create email addresses that are nearly identical to those of trusted sources, sneaking in an extra letter or using a zero instead of a capital \"O,\" for example.\n\nIn some cases, such as the Russian hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spear phishing emails will direct users to phony websites, where victims will enter their credentials and unwittingly give hackers their usernames and passwords. In the DCCC case, Russian agents then installed malware on at least 10 of the committee's computers, according to the indictment, allowing them to monitor individual employees' computer activity, steal passwords and maintain access to the DCCC network.\n\n\"There are two ways to get into computers,\" Levy said. \"There is the sophisticated hacking where you figure out how to break through a security system ... [or] you attack the weakest link in the security system, and that's the user.\"\n\nOnce hackers have access to a company's email system, \"they will sit and watch to learn as much as they can about people,\" Levy said, adding that cyber criminals can glean anything from employees' email habits to the name of the company president's wife.\n\nMcAndrew, of Ballard Spahr, said once hackers gain entry to an email account, they can peruse a user's messages, work calendars and contacts, as if someone is \"virtually looking over their shoulders.\"\n\n\"You're able to know about events before they happen by reading about them,\" McAndrew said. \"You know what's coming up.\"\n\nHackers aware of an upcoming payment can pounce by sending spear phishing emails to trick recipients into wiring money to accounts under the hackers' control, McAndrew said.\n\nVictims of internet crimes suffered more than $1.4 billion in losses in 2017, almost doubling since 2013, according to an FBI report on the issue released in May. Crimes listed as \"business email compromise/email account compromise\" accounted for more than $676 million of that 2017 total, representing the largest category of loss.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nOne way to reduce the risk from spear phishing is use multi-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just a username and password, but knowledge or possession of something that only that user has, such as a code sent to a cell phone.\n\n\"Even if you get tricked and you go to some bogus site and type in your password, it will be useless without\" the other piece of information, said Anthony Vance, director of Temple University's Center for Cybersecurity.\n\nVance suggested using twofactorauth.org, which tells users whether websites support multi-factor authentication. Major services such as Google or Yahoo allow users to activate the service.\n\nExperts said individuals should use some common sense too. Resist the urge to click links or attachments from an unknown source or unexpected message. Check with colleagues before responding to a suspicious email.\n\n\"The number one thing people can do is scrutinize every single email they receive,\" McAndrew said.", "Winfrey has an exclusive on-camera deal with OWN but can appear elsewhere on a limited basis\n\nApple Inc has signed a multiyear deal with Oprah Winfrey to create programming as part of the iPhone maker's push into original entertainment, the company said on Friday.\n\n'Together, Winfrey and Apple will create original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world,' Apple said in a statement.\n\nApple gave no details of the type of programming that Winfrey would create, the value of the deal or when it might be released.

Hotel. Transportation in Miami. Plus food. Twenty thousand dollars, Wardlaw estimated, would cover the trip.\n\nIn the National Premier Soccer League, 98 minor-league teams annually scrounge up the money to finance playoff runs that can last up to six rounds with multiple road trips in between.\n\nWith limited resources and dozens of teams traveling in the playoffs, the NPSL awards a $5,000 stipend to each traveling team for the first four rounds, and it fully reimburses teams that reach the national semifinals and championship game. The Rangers' game in Miami is considered the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Rangers' 12-hour bus ride from Little Rock to Laredo was $6,300, Wardlaw said, and the third-year nonprofit franchise didn't have enough money left to cover another road trip, plus the rental fee check for playing 11 home games at War Memorial Stadium this season.\n\nWardlaw needed another option.\n\n\"I always want us to appear as professional as possible, not beg for money and things like that,\" said Wardlaw, 43, the vice president of an audiometrics company. \"I was just to the point where I needed to ask for some help. Some people suggested [GoFundMe] to me, and I was like, might as well give it a shot.\"\n\nAfter the Rangers' first goal, Wardlaw pulled out his iPhone and started to create the GoFundMe page.\n\nThen his phone died, but the Rangers' season didn't when they beat Laredo 2-1 in extra time.\n\n\"I don't know how we're going to get to Miami,\" Wardlaw told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette through his Apple Watch after Tuesday night's victory.\n\nWednesday morning, while riding the bus back to Little Rock, Wardlaw finished up the GoFundMe account.\n\nThen he posted.\n\n\"We're headed to Miami!!!\" the account read. \"As you can imagine the budgets for minor league soccer are small ... Any help you can give to continue our postseason run is greatly appreciated.\"\n\nWardlaw received an email each time a donation arrived.\n\nWardlaw turned in his seat on the bus and looked at Montgomery, the Rangers' third-year head coach.\n\nAs of press time, 200 separate donations had garnered $17,208 of the $20,000 goal.\n\nThe amounts rolled in as low as $5 and as high as $500.\n\n\"Having two children that have participated in club soccer in neighboring states, I know how financially burdensome it can be,\" said Lori Holzwarth, 49, an attorney in Maumelle who donated $200 along with her husband, Ted. \"I can't imagine putting a group of young men on a bus, taking them to Laredo, and then to Miami to compete. What we do as parents is small in comparison to what Jonathan's having to do, and I wanted to support that.\"\n\nTed and Lori have been season-ticket holders since the inaugural 2016 season, and Ted recalled when Wardlaw hand-delivered their season tickets and was transparently uncertain about the franchise's future.\n\n\"Jonathan Wardlaw is a hell of a guy, and people have great admiration for what he does,\" said Ted, 50. \"There's no way that these people are going to let him fail. We're not going to let that happen.\"\n\nMatt Boullt -- the general manager of Tulsa Athletic, a Heartland Conference rival that the Rangers eliminated in the first round of the playoffs -- even chipped in $20.\n\n\"It's these lower-league teams,\" said Boullt, 28. \"We've got to stick together.\"\n\nFormer international and Major League Soccer player Ante Jazic, the Rangers' director of soccer operations, and his wife, Annemarie, donated $500. Her father, Alex Dillard, president of Dillards Inc., also donated $500.\n\n\"It's so inspiring to see some of the support,\" Annemarie said. \"People don't realize that all this work is for free. [Wardlaw] does all his work, he and his wife [Babs], and they spend their weekend's extra time on a project they don't get anything financially out of.\"\n\nIt's a plight NPSL franchises have dealt with since the league began in 2003.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's a semi-professional league,\" said Joe Barrone, president of the NPSL. \"It's the responsibility of the team and the rest of the owners to fund their individual teams.\"\n\nBarrone said Wednesday the league has increased Little Rock's travel stipend above $5,000.\n\n\"We've upped the amount to make them more comfortable,\" said Barrone, who would not disclose the final dollar amount.\n\nWardlaw guaranteed Wednesday afternoon that the Rangers would travel to Miami.\n\nAnd the donations continued to flow in.\n\n\"Soccer people are different than other sports fans,\" Ted Holzwarth said. \"They're more hard-core about just the sport itself. It's been a much maligned sport. It's been called a communist sport. American football fans put it down.\n\n\"When you have this animosity from the outside world, soccer fans get hard-core and really tend to support their own.\"", "Nevada's elected officials are quick to give away our tax dollars to lure wealthy corporations like Tesla, Apple and Switch to our state under the guise of jobs for the working class when it's obvious it's really about creating riches for developers and business barons.\n\nBut we rarely talk about who pays the biggest price in terms of overcrowded and underfunded schools, minuscule public health budgets, and wages that don't cover decent, stable housing or health insurance deductibles. That would be our kids.\n\nThe 2018 Nevada Kids Count book was released last month, and there was little to cheer about in our overall ranking of 47th in the nation in \"child well being,\" well below the three states with the best rankings -- New Hampshire at number one, Massachusetts at two, New Jersey at three. Thank God for Mississippi (48th), Louisiana (49th) and New Mexico (50th) for cushioning us from being dead last.\n\nIt's true that Nevada has continued to make significant improvements in children's health care coverage, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that everyone have health insurance, a mandate stripped from the law by the Republican Congress last year. Nevada experienced an 8.1 percent decline in the uninsured rate among children between 2013 and 2016, one of the largest decreases in the nation, although we still rank low, at 43rd.\n\nWe did a smidgen better in the \"family and community\" category of the data book (42nd), and we ranked 43rd in \"economic well-being.\" Thirty-four percent of our children live in households with a high housing cost burden, a number that will likely worsen in future years thanks to the new, out-of-state residents pouring in to work those jobs that were supposedly created for Nevadans.\n\nEducation is the category that always disappoints despite decades of bipartisan efforts to improve our schools. This year we ranked 49th, with 64 percent of our young children ages three and four not in school, far worse than the national average of 52 percent. According to Kids Count, 69 percent of our fourth-graders are not proficient in reading, and 73 percent of our eighth graders can't do their math. Twenty-six percent of our high school students did not graduate on time during the 2015-16 school year, compared to the national average of 16 percent. You can't blame the school districts for all of it, either -- hungry and sick kids can't learn, and children who don't go to preschool must catch up in underfunded, overcrowded classrooms.\n\nBefore we shrug our shoulders and mutter about how the data is skewed and doesn't take into account our uniqueness, let's face the truth. Children are not our top priority in Nevada. If they were, we'd take this shameful report card to heart and start investing every last cent we have in education and health care, starting at infancy. We'd demand an end to transferable tax credits like those we gave to Tesla, tax credits they've sold to casino corporations that are now using them to lower their gambling tax obligations, creating a double whammy for taxpayers.\n\nAnd now, another worry. Kids Count estimates about one million children younger than age five were not counted during the 2010 U.S. Census, often because their entire family wasn't counted due to homelessness, immigration status or transiency. In Nevada, about 68,000 children live in hard-to-count census areas.\n\nThese lost children matter since the 2020 Census helps determine how much federal funding Nevada will receive for programs that directly benefit young children such as Head Start, Women, Infants, and Children (food and nutrition service), and Title One (federal aid program for public schools). And guess who wants to add a citizenship question to the census to drive even more people underground?\n\nStates like Nevada with large and transient immigrant populations stand to lose critical dollars our children desperately need.", "Apple is once again being sent to the court for an alleged patent violation, and this time a Singapore-based company claims iPhone 8 and iPhone X use their lead-free solder without authorization.\n\nSingapore Asahi Chemical & Solder Industries PTE Ltd. has filed a lawsuit in Ohio, asking for a jury trial because of what they describe as patent violation with a series of iPhone models, starting with the iPhone 7 and newer.\n\nThe Singaporean firm says it patented its invention in 2001 and wants Apple to pay damages and legal fees as part of the lawsuit, though no specifics are provided on the payment request. It does hope that damages would be tripled, however, according to court documents published by AI.\n\nApple tight-lipped on the lawsuit\n\n\"The '947 Patent is generally directed to solder alloys with improved physical and chemical properties that comprise effective amounts of tin, copper, silver, and bismuth. At the time of the invention, the Co-Inventors recognized that traditional lead-tin solder alloys 'face[d] a limited future due to lead toxicity and the control or prohibition of the use of lead on a global landscape,'\" the plaintiff says about its technology in the lawsuit.\n\n\"As a result, high strength and high fatigue resistance solder alloys were developed to meet the increasing level of performance needed in solder joints as required by the continued advancements in integrated circuit (\"IC\") and IC package technologies. Among those alloys developed are those which are covered by the '947 Patent.\"\n\nApple hasn't commented on this new lawsuit, as per its own approach, though it remains to be seen if the company does decide to fight these claims in court or not.\n\nThe Singapore-based firm isn't known as a patent troll, so it's not exactly clear if a settlement is possible, but it'll be certainly interesting to see how Apple responds to these accusations.\n\nSingapore Asahi versus Apple by Mike Wuerthele on Scribd", "New Delhi: At nearly $940 billion, Apple is certainly well on the way to becoming the world's first trillion dollar company -- and the feat could be achieved as early as the end of this year with upcoming iPhone launches.\n\nThe tech giant crossed the $900 billion market capitalisation mark in November last year following the launch of its \"super premium\" iPhone X and, according to CEO Tim Cook, in India,\"we set a new first-half record\" as Apple reported record results for the first quarter of 2018.\n\nHowever, in India -- the world's third-largest smartphone market -- the Cupertino-based iPhone maker has not crossed sales of 2-3 per cent despite arriving in the country almost a decade back.\n\nTrying hard to make inroads, the company is currently going through an overhaul under Michel Coulomb, the new head of the India operations who took over from Sanjay Kaul in December last year.\n\nThe iPhone maker is also seeking tax relief and other incentives from the government to begin assembling more handsets in the country and its proposal to set up a manufacturing unit is reportedly being evaluated.\n\nIn 2017, Apple sold nearly 3.2 million iPhones in India. As the company requires to increase its market cap by nearly six per cent to become a trillion-dollar company, can India pitch in?\n\nAccording to industry experts, India is the fastest-growing among the top 20 smartphone markets globally, with a large untapped user base potential in Tier 5 and 6 cities and beyond.\n\nThe rapid growth of the smartphone market can be attributed to several factors like low smartphone penetration, inexpensive mobile data and growing aspirational middle class.\n\n\"As a result, the Indian smartphone market continues to look fertile in the coming years, helping brands grow and enhance their portfolios.\n\n\"Certainly, for Apple too, it's a big market to target and grow as the aspirational buyers continue to opt for this luxury brand,\" Upasana Joshi, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, told IANS.\n\nThe current smartphone user base in India is at 400 million which is set to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Apple's market share in India has grown in recent years. It is a premium range player and is performing well in that segment in the country,\" says Anshul Gupta, Research Director at Gartner.\n\nAccording to Gupta, like any other major player, the iPhone maker is bullish on the country and plans to expand its operations.\n\n\"Whether India will help it become the $1 trillion company is not known yet -- but yes, the smartphone market in India is growing across price segments, providing ample opportunities for Apple,\" Gupta told IANS.\n\nApart from Samsung, which recently unveiled the world's largest mobile factory in India, another big worry for Apple are a couple of Chinese players who have wooed a big chunk of aspirational users who would otherwise have shifted to new iPhones.\n\n\"Chinese players like OnePlus and Oppo have stopped the flow of users to Apple by selling premium devices in the Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 range with the latest features. The charm of owning older iPhones is also over as large displays with better aspect ratios are now being preferred,\" Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst at Forrester Research, told IANS.\n\nUnless Apple manufactures the latest iPhones here and sells them cheap, things won't change and may further deteriorate, he warned.\n\nCompared to the US, India is a \"mobile first\" market and, hence, most of the digital services are designed around smartphones which makes them central to the users' lives.\n\n\"However, compared to the US, the average selling price (ASP) in India is more skewed around $150, making it a tough market for Apple where even the older models such as iPhone 6S are being sold for $300 -- thus reducing the overall total addressable market (TAM) opportunity for it to capitalise strongly,\" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.\n\nToday, \"Apple has a two per cent share of smartphone sales in the Indian market and the remaining 98 per cent of the market has been warming up to, and becoming deeply entrenched in, the Android ecosystem,\" Pathak added.\n\nApple is currently assembling just one model in India -- the iPhone 6S (earlier it was iPhone SE which didn't make much headway) -- with its partner Wistron. Missing are the iPhone 7, 8 or X series which further distances Apple from the overall opportunity.\n\n\"Apple can still remain bullish on India with only 30 per cent of the population using smartphone and a potential opportunity for all the players in the mobile ecosystem, including Apple,\" Pathak noted.\n\nAccording to Joshi, Apple has been successful in India, evident from the fact that iPhone users are some of the most loyal users among all smartphone brands, waiting eagerly to get their hands on the new model of iPhone.\n\nStill, being merely bullish may not help Apple in the near future. The time is ripe to take some concrete steps, bring India on its global sales map, and cross the $1 trillion-dollar hurdle.", "Let's face it, when it comes to holidays, some days are more important than others.\n\nWe all know the big ones: Christmas.

Von mehreren Seiten war bereits zu h\u00f6ren, dass volle Leistung nur f\u00fcr kurze Zeit erreicht werden kann, bevor sich die Taktrate dann wesentlich absenkt. Allerdings sind Benchmark-Ergebnisse und Einsatz im Alltag oft unterschiedlich. Selbst bei performance-hungrigen Anwendungen muss die CPU nicht durchg\u00e4ngig immer voll am Anschlag laufen, weswegen die im Benchmarktest gemessene, vollst\u00e4ndige Auslastung kein ganz realistisches Szenario ist.\n\nDass sich unter diesen Umst\u00e4nden der maximale Takt nicht lange halten l\u00e4sst, ist weder ein exklusives Problem des neuen MacBook Pro, noch eines, das lediglich bei Apple zu beobachten ist. Auch fr\u00fchere Baureihen mussten die Leistung absenken, wenn die CPU hei\u00df wurde. Allerdings deuten die bisherigen Daten darauf hin, dass die sechs Kerne des Core i9 etwas zu viel des Guten sein k\u00f6nnten. Ein neuer Test ermittelt, wie sich das MacBook Pro mit Core i9 in Final Cut Pro verh\u00e4lt.\n\nZun\u00e4chst das etwas ern\u00fcchternde und paradox erscheinende Ergebnis: Deaktiviert man \u00fcber die Entwickler-Tools zwei Kerne und exportiert das Projekt aus Final Cut Pro mit nur vier der sechs Kerne, so ist die Arbeit in 5 Minuten und 12 Sekunden erledigt. Mit allen sechs Kernen muss die Leistung hingegen so abgesenkt werden, dass es trotz zweier zus\u00e4tzlicher Kerne 18 Sekunden l\u00e4nger dauert, bis der Export beendet ist. Vom Anfang der Woche durchgef\u00fchrten K\u00fchlschrank-Test inspiriert, wurde nun als Vergleichswert die Performance in sehr kalter Umgebung ermittelt. Jetzt arbeiteten die sechs Kerne durchg\u00e4ngig so schnell, dass der Export nur 4 Minuten und 51 Sekunden dauerte.\n\nEine Sache ist allerdings merkw\u00fcrdig: W\u00e4hrend des regul\u00e4ren Test bricht die Taktrate mehrfach auf 800 MHz ein. Hier ist v\u00f6llig unklar, warum dies geschieht, denn bei besagten 800 MHz handelt es sich eigentlich um die Idle-Frequenz und nicht um den \"Hot State\". Dies passiert aber nicht, wenn das MacBook Pro im K\u00fchlschrank liegt.\n\nZuletzt wurde noch ein iMac Pro als Vergleichsger\u00e4t untersucht. Dieser konnte die volle Taktrate durchg\u00e4ngig halten - der wesentlich leistungsf\u00e4higeren und gr\u00f6\u00dferen K\u00fchlung sei Dank. Allerdings nahm sich der iMac Pro mehr Zeit f\u00fcr den Export und stellte das Projekt erst nach sechs Minuten fertig. Der Grund: Die verbauten Xeon-CPUs verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber noch kein hardwareseitiges Video Encoding (\"Intel Quick Sync Video\"), was im MacBook Pro f\u00fcr die sehr guten Werte sorgt - trotz starker Drosselung.", "This would put it in competition with the Apple Home Pod and the Google Home Max.\n\nSamsung is reportedly planning to release a Bixby powered smart speaker in the next month. According to The Wall Street Journal (Via The Verge), the device will cost around $300 and will be marketed as a high-end music player.\n\nThis fits in with comments from Samsung Mobile chief DJ Koh made in February where he said Samsung expected to release a premium Bixby-powered smart speaker alongside the Galaxy Note 9.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says the speaker will be bowl-shaped with legs on the bottom and lights on top (hope those lights are shaped like eyes for the proper Batteries Not Included experience). It will also apparently have a sound shifting feature that will be able to play audio in the direction of the person talking to it, so it may seem like it responds more directly rather than speaking \"to the room.\"\n\nThe speaker will presumably use the upcoming Bixby version 2.0. The new version of Samsung's AI assistant has long been rumored to feature on the Galaxy Note 9, so it would make a lot of sense that the speaker would also come with the latest version (if they launch simultaneously).\n\nWhile previous rumors suggested Samsung would release different versions of its smart speaker at different prices, this wasn't mentioned by The Wall Street Journal in the latest report. However, considering both Google and Amazon have released cheaper versions of their respective smart speakers, it wouldn't be surprising if Samsung eventually does the same.\n\nIf the $300 price-tag is correct, the speaker would be competing with -- although slightly cheaper than -- high-end devices such as the Apple HomePod ($349.99) and Google Home Max ($399). As well as a more attractive price, Samsung could give its speaker an edge by integrating its wealth of existing products.\n\nSamsung will have to convince people that its Bixby Assistant is the one that they want to have in their homes, however. Considering the popularity of Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant, this could be the toughest hurdle to overcome.", "H-1B Work Visa: In April, the USCIS said it received 105,000 more H-1B applications than it can grant\n\nHighlightsUS Citizenship and Immigration Services recently updated its guidance Visas to be denied without intimation if applications are incomplete The new policy will go into effect from September 11\n\nFor highly-skilled foreign workers applying for a new work visa or an extension, the stakes involved just got a whole lot higher.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently updated its guidance, taking a much stricter approach to approving applications that are largely filed by those seeking work in the tech industry.\n\nUnder the new policy, which goes into effect Sept. 11, agents will be able to deny applications deemed incomplete or containing errors, without first asking applicants to address the flaw or warning them of an intent to refuse their submission. Recently the agency also widened the range of cases for which it could begin the process of removing foreign nationals to include those whose immigration benefits, such as work status, have been denied.\n\nThe measures are likely to disproportionately affect those whose applications require large amounts of supporting evidence, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Employees with H-1B visas -- mostly held by people in the technology, science and medicine industries -- are currently often asked to respond to a request for evidence from USCIS to prove whether they are qualified for their work, or whether their job is considered a specialty occupation, Pierce added.\n\nThe number of applications for H-1B visas has far exceeded the 85,000 annual cap on awards in recent fiscal years (Bloomberg)\n\nThe updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency,\" Pierce said. The USCIS in February updated its mission statement to remove reference to the U.S. as a \"nation of immigrants\" and instead included language on \"protecting Americans\" and \"securing the homeland.\"\n\nIn April, the USCIS said it received 105,000 more H-1B applications than it can grant, according to a National Foundation for American Policy report. Still, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and other U.S. tech giants saw an increase in the number of H-1B applications approved in 2017.\n\nH-1B Visa: The updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency\"\n\nThe recent move by USCIS \"creates traps\" for individuals already working legally in the country -- or seeking to work here -- by upping the consequences for clerical errors, said Todd Schulte, president of immigration reform lobbying group Fwd.us, which was founded by technology leaders including Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston.\n\nAnd it could affect more than just tech companies, Schulte said. \"Cracking down on legal immigration is simply this: It's encouraging innovation and job growth to happen someplace else.\" Microsoft Corp. expanded its Vancouver office several years ago, in part due to Canada's more lax visa regulations.\n\nThe updated USCIS policies add a layer of instability for employers. \"There's a chance that not only is the case going to be denied, but also that the beneficiary could be placed in removal proceedings,\" said Hassan Ahmad, managing attorney with the HMA law firm. \"How can you do business with this type of uncertainty?\"\n\nUSCIS spokesman Michael Bars said the policy changes are part of an effort to help \"cut down on frivolous applications, reduce waste, and help ensure legitimate, law abiding petitioners aren't undermined by those able to game our system.\"\n\nThe number of requests for evidence to H-1B visa petitions rose 45 percent for the period of Jan.1 to Aug. 31, 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to a report by Reuters. Given the volume of the requests, \"it may seem like it would be a natural option\" for USCIS officers to want to leverage the new policies to avoid issuing additional RFE's, said Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But without the requests for evidence, applicants don't have an opportunity to explain themselves if they make a mistake that could be as minor as writing their work address incorrectly on an application, she said.", "SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon.com's stock market value reached $900 billion on Wednesday for the first time, marking a major milestone in its 21-year trajectory as a publicly listed company and threatening to dislodge Apple as Wall Street's most valuable jewel.\n\nAfter Jeff Bezos founded the online book-selling company in his garage in 1994, Amazon survived the dot-com crisis and then expanded across the retail industry, altering how consumers buy products and setting off a Darwinian struggle among brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAfter announcing on Wednesday that it sold more than $100 million products during its annual Prime Day sale, the Seattle, Washington company's stock briefly touched $1,858.88, giving Amazon a stock market value of $902 billion.

Twenty thousand dollars, Wardlaw estimated, would cover the trip.\n\nIn the National Premier Soccer League, 98 minor-league teams annually scrounge up the money to finance playoff runs that can last up to six rounds with multiple road trips in between.\n\nWith limited resources and dozens of teams traveling in the playoffs, the NPSL awards a $5,000 stipend to each traveling team for the first four rounds, and it fully reimburses teams that reach the national semifinals and championship game. The Rangers' game in Miami is considered the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Rangers' 12-hour bus ride from Little Rock to Laredo was $6,300, Wardlaw said, and the third-year nonprofit franchise didn't have enough money left to cover another road trip, plus the rental fee check for playing 11 home games at War Memorial Stadium this season.\n\nWardlaw needed another option.\n\n\"I always want us to appear as professional as possible, not beg for money and things like that,\" said Wardlaw, 43, the vice president of an audiometrics company. \"I was just to the point where I needed to ask for some help. Some people suggested [GoFundMe] to me, and I was like, might as well give it a shot.\"\n\nAfter the Rangers' first goal, Wardlaw pulled out his iPhone and started to create the GoFundMe page.\n\nThen his phone died, but the Rangers' season didn't when they beat Laredo 2-1 in extra time.\n\n\"I don't know how we're going to get to Miami,\" Wardlaw told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette through his Apple Watch after Tuesday night's victory.\n\nWednesday morning, while riding the bus back to Little Rock, Wardlaw finished up the GoFundMe account.\n\nThen he posted.\n\n\"We're headed to Miami!!!\" the account read. \"As you can imagine the budgets for minor league soccer are small ...

As the company requires to increase its market cap by nearly six per cent to become a trillion-dollar company, can India pitch in?\n\nAccording to industry experts, India is the fastest-growing among the top 20 smartphone markets globally, with a large untapped user base potential in Tier 5 and 6 cities and beyond.\n\nThe rapid growth of the smartphone market can be attributed to several factors like low smartphone penetration, inexpensive mobile data and growing aspirational middle class.\n\n\"As a result, the Indian smartphone market continues to look fertile in the coming years, helping brands grow and enhance their portfolios.\n\n\"Certainly, for Apple too, it's a big market to target and grow as the aspirational buyers continue to opt for this luxury brand,\" Upasana Joshi, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, told IANS.\n\nThe current smartphone user base in India is at 400 million which is set to grow by leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Apple's market share in India has grown in recent years. It is a premium range player and is performing well in that segment in the country,\" says Anshul Gupta, Research Director at Gartner.\n\nAccording to Gupta, like any other major player, the iPhone maker is bullish on the country and plans to expand its operations.\n\n\"Whether India will help it become the $1 trillion company is not known yet -- but yes, the smartphone market in India is growing across price segments, providing ample opportunities for Apple,\" Gupta told IANS.\n\nApart from Samsung, which recently unveiled the world's largest mobile factory in India, another big worry for Apple are a couple of Chinese players who have wooed a big chunk of aspirational users who would otherwise have shifted to new iPhones.\n\n\"Chinese players like OnePlus and Oppo have stopped the flow of users to Apple by selling premium devices in the Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 range with the latest features. The charm of owning older iPhones is also over as large displays with better aspect ratios are now being preferred,\" Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst at Forrester Research, told IANS.\n\nUnless Apple manufactures the latest iPhones here and sells them cheap, things won't change and may further deteriorate, he warned.\n\nCompared to the US, India is a \"mobile first\" market and, hence, most of the digital services are designed around smartphones which makes them central to the users' lives.\n\n\"However, compared to the US, the average selling price (ASP) in India is more skewed around $150, making it a tough market for Apple where even the older models such as iPhone 6S are being sold for $300 -- thus reducing the overall total addressable market (TAM) opportunity for it to capitalise strongly,\" Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.\n\nToday, \"Apple has a two per cent share of smartphone sales in the Indian market and the remaining 98 per cent of the market has been warming up to, and becoming deeply entrenched in, the Android ecosystem,\" Pathak added.\n\nApple is currently assembling just one model in India -- the iPhone 6S (earlier it was iPhone SE which didn't make much headway) -- with its partner Wistron. Missing are the iPhone 7, 8 or X series which further distances Apple from the overall opportunity.\n\n\"Apple can still remain bullish on India with only 30 per cent of the population using smartphone and a potential opportunity for all the players in the mobile ecosystem, including Apple,\" Pathak noted.\n\nAccording to Joshi, Apple has been successful in India, evident from the fact that iPhone users are some of the most loyal users among all smartphone brands, waiting eagerly to get their hands on the new model of iPhone.\n\nStill, being merely bullish may not help Apple in the near future.

They argue that just because a product is included in a Black Friday sale, it doesn't stop them discounting it at other times of year, too. That's true, but it's also a tacit acceptance that there may be better times to shop for a bargain.'\n\nWho are the culprits?\n\nSome of the worst offenders were some of our top retailers and the deals make sorry reading.\n\nThere was the Neff Slide and Hide oven from Currys/PC World. It sounded like a good deal at \u00a3494.99, particularly as the retailer's adverts claimed it had been priced at \u00a3599.99 throughout September and most of October.\n\nBut the oven was actually cheaper than the Black Friday price for at least 113 other days of the year. It cost \u00a3449.99 -- \u00a345 cheaper -- just three weeks later.\n\nThe Neff Slide and Hide oven was cheaper than on Black Friday for at least 113 days of the year.

The build-up has already been diluted by the fact that so many shops have been discounting goods all month.\n\nThe Braun 3040s Series 3 electric shaver was advertised at \u00a339.99 but was the same price at least nine times in June and July, and between \u00a34 and \u00a35 cheaper at least five times in December\n\nThere are also suggestions that UK discounts aren't as high as those in other countries.\n\nWhile online prices here were cut by an average of 12 per cent last year, according to UK retail strategy expert Jamie Merrick, of Salesforce Commerce Cloud, they were down a whopping 29 per cent in the U.S., and 20 and 23 per cent in Germany and France respectively.\n\nHowever, it seems that 31 per cent of households are planning on getting involved, and there are predictions that \u00a31.74 million will be spent online every minute of the day itself, \u00a33 billion will be spent over the four days from Friday to Monday and more than \u00a310 billion during the week.\n\nCommerce consultancy Salmon expects there will be \u00a320 billion-worth of online sales in November, overtaking December sales -- which, for retailers at least, is good news.\n\nFrom toothbrushes to children's bikes, here are some Black Friday deals really worth shelling out for\n\nRevealed, the bogus offers where those 'savings' just didn't add up\n\nCurrys/PC World -- Eight deals were cheaper or the same price after Black Friday:\n\nThe Samsung 55-inch Smart 4k Ultra HD HDR curved TV KU6670 was advertised as 'Save \u00a3400' now \u00a3849 (was \u00a31,249 from May 11, 2016 to June 22) but was \u00a350 cheaper at least 29 times in December, January and April, the same price at least seven times in April and \u00a379 cheaper at least 18 times in May.The DeLonghi Magnifica bean-to-cup coffee machine was advertised at \u00a3349, 'Save \u00a3380' (was \u00a3729.99 from Sept 6 to Oct 10, 2016) but was the same price at least 28 times in December.

Richard Headland, editor-in-chief of Which? Magazine, has some tips ...\n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH\n\nBe focused. Identify which products you want to look for and get a feel for prices. You can use Which? to look up product reviews and find out current and historical prices at a range of popular retailers, or websites such as CamelCamelCamel for Amazon price history. Compare what looks like a good Black Friday deal with other retailers. Don't be swayed by a claimed 'saving'.\n\nWATCH THE HYPE\n\nWe're easily taken in by bright signs proclaiming 'Was \u00a3100, now \u00a350', but these may not be true. By law, a product has to have been on offer at the higher price for 28 days before a discount is offered, but this isn't always the case. As long as there is a note explaining the offer, shops get away with it.\n\nKEEP YOUR COOL\n\nYou are the target of aggressive marketing -- so stay cool and calm. More than ever, it's clear that it's not just a day of discounts, so if you're not convinced, then hold back.\n\nBEWARE THE RRP\n\nBe suspicious of RRP prices (recommended retail price). Officially, the manufacturer isn't allowed to set the price of a product. In reality, there is collaboration, so that a manufacturer will sell at a discount at the same time as an independent retailer. Apple is a good example of this. Having said that, you can still have a look at the RRP on the manufacturer's website, to see whether a retailer is being honest.\n\nPRICE PROMISES\n\nTry to buy from retailers with a price promise -- those who'll refund the difference if you find a better deal on the same product elsewhere, or if the price drops later.\n\nCOUNT IN DELIVERY\n\nLook at delivery costs in advance. In a Which? survey, four in ten people said paying for postage and packing was an irritating part of online shopping. Some retailers offer a buy online and pick up later service, which means you don't have to go near the shops on the day itself.\n\nPRODUCT REVIEWS\n\nCheck out reviews. In some cases, a discount on a product will be there for a good reason and shops might struggle to give them away.", "Staff at Amazon are preparing for their busiest Black Friday on record tomorrow. with Britons expected to spend an estimated \u00a38 billion over the weekend.\n\nWorkers at the Peterborough fulfilment centre in Cambridgeshire are getting ready for a frantic festive season of picking and packing, with millions of Britons set to snap up the limited time deals.\n\nAmazon is offering deals on thousands of gifts, with its Black Friday store open until Sunday.\n\nStaff at Amazon's fulfilment centre in Cambridgeshire, pictured, is preparing for the 'busiest black Friday' on record\n\nStaff will be working around the clock as shoppers take advantage of the sales to buy their presents for Christmas\n\nThe company has opened four new warehouses across the country which have created 3,500 new permanent jobs\n\nThere will also be thousands of 'Lightning Deals' on offer with products available at a discount, in limited quantities, for a short period of time.\n\nThis year hundreds of small businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace will also be offering thousands of Black Friday deals.\n\n'Customers tell us they love getting extra low prices so they can save on their Christmas shopping.

This year we'll be helping our customers save even more, by adding a record-breaking number of offers and discount codes to our site; helping people to save money on treating themselves, as well as on gifts for friends and family.'\n\nAccording to Anita Naik, Lifestyle Editor at VoucherCodes, consumers should develop a strategy to secure the best deals.\n\nShe said: 'Black Friday is now one of the biggest shopping days of the year in Britain, which means if you're planning to jump in and do some Christmas shopping you can expect crowds on the high street and busy retail websites. There are ways to get the most out of the day without having to fight it out with fellow shoppers and my number one rule is to be prepared. This means know what you want, know where to get it from and know how to grab it before everyone else.'\n\nMs Naik said looking on a website such as VoucherCodes can cut down on the work.\n\nShe said: 'Set a budget and write a list. The key thing is to know what you want to buy and, most importantly, how much it usually costs.\n\n'It's easy to get drawn in by the discounts on the day, so knowing how much the things you want cost pre-Black Friday is key. If you're the type of person who gets easily swayed into buying things on impulse, make sure you review your available Black Friday budget ahead of the day and stick to it like glue. It may sound boring, but bargains are only bargains if you need them!'\n\nMs Naik said some of the deals go live shortly after midnight, so it might be worth setting an alarm.

Witnesses said that the two men began arguing in the parking lot - though exactly why remains to be uncovered. Both were hospitalized\n\nThat same day in St Louis, Missouri, a protest (left and right) against police brutality, banking practices and other issues led to seven people being arrested. Protesters said they were leaving peacefully when police kicked off the violence\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\n'Get clean and sober' Sharon Osbourne on Meghan Markle's father\n\nWatch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nBritish diver involved in Thai soccer team rescue feared the worst\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nBeaming Prince Harry and Meghan open Nelson Mandela exhibition\n\nWatch video\n\n'My view has not changed' FBI Director Chris Wray on Russia\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave lion cub forced to jump into raging river to follow mother\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nLabradoodle is a scardy cat when it comes to escalators\n\nThe Houston incident occurred in the Sears parking lot outside Willowbrook Mall at 12.30pm on Friday when two Hispanic men got into an argument.\n\nOne was shot and the other stabbed, Fox 26 reported, though neither died. Both were then flown by helicopter to Life Flight medical helicopter to Memorial Hermann Hospital - Texas Medical Center for treatment.\n\nPolice said that although there were plenty of people in the parking lot at the time, none of the witnesses knew anything about what had occurred.\n\n'We don't know if they know each other, we don't know if they got into an argument inside the mall and they came out here, we don't know any of that,' said Houston Police Department Sergeant Richard Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez said the incident was confined to the two men and that no one else is at risk.\n\nHowever, he warned shoppers to be aware of their surroundings when picking up gifts.\n\n'It's all about situational awareness,' he said. 'Know where you're at and who's around you. People are out shopping and the criminals are out shopping for your stuff.'\n\nSituational awareness was certainly needed for those visiting the St Louis Galleria mall in Richmond Heights, Missouri, on Black Friday, as the usual holiday hubbub was accompanied by a mass protest.\n\nThe hundreds marched through the large suburban mall to protest a raft of grievances based around the treatment of black people in the city, from police brutality to bank loan practices.\n\nThe Missouri protesters had targeted the mall (left) as they felt economic disruption was the only thing authorities would care about. They said police targeted people who were not part of the protest and acted antagonistically and aggressively\n\nIt came after a November 2 announcement by a group compromised of local African-American clergy and activists who said the only way to have their issues taken seriously was to impact the local economy.\n\nProtesters said the march was peaceful until the end, when they were asked to leave the mall. As they complied, several protesters later said, police attacked a man who was not part of their group.\n\nDarryl Gray, a pastor, said: '[The police] asked us to disperse and we were leaving. We had a shopper not even in our crowd chanting in support of us. Police turned around and grabbed a black guy who was chanting.'\n\nAmong the arrested was state Rep. Bruce Franks Jr (pictured). He was reportedly hauled off for intervening in the arrest of a bystander who had chanted support for the protesters. Police have not confirmed who was arrested\n\nGray said that when state Rep. Bruce Franks Jr, who was present at the action, tried to intervene, he was forced to the ground and arrested.\n\n'He had not touched anyone,' said Gray, who characterized the police response as 'overly aggressive' and 'brutal'.\n\nAn Instagram user who recorded footage of a scuffle said she was shopping for Christmas presents when she 'witnessed a kid who wasn't even part of the protest get slammed against a glass wall, and thrown to the ground by multiple officers'.\n\n'I can say from first hand experience today the people were protesting peacefully, and it was the police who antagonized, and facilitated the violence,' she added.\n\nAnd a Twitter user, Dr JA Salaam, recorded footage of protester chanting 'No justice, no profits' and 'You're gonna stop killing us' as they marched through the mall. He characterized the police as 'attacking' two people as the group was leaving.\n\nPolice have not revealed the names of any of those who were arrested.\n\nBut despite all of the chaos, experts told the New York Post that 2017's Black Friday was - economically, at least - a success.\n\n'This is the best Black Friday in three or four years,' said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners retail research firm. 'It's not quite as robust as the ones of the mid-2000s, but the best of the last few years.'\n\nThat came despite reports that shoppers are now spending more online this holiday season than in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nAmericans spent a whopping $5billion online in just 24 hours, according to CNN Money, citing Adobe Digital Insights - a 19.9 per cent increase compared to Black Friday last year.\n\nWhile most shoppers were peaceful in their pursuit of cut-priced goods, brawls and tugs-of-war were reported elsewhere in the US. One, in a Buckle store in Hoover, Alabama, resulted in two women being arrested.\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\n'Get clean and sober' Sharon Osbourne on Meghan Markle's father\n\nWatch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nBritish diver involved in Thai soccer team rescue feared the worst\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nBeaming Prince Harry and Meghan open Nelson Mandela exhibition\n\nWatch video\n\n'My view has not changed' FBI Director Chris Wray on Russia\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave lion cub forced to jump into raging river to follow mother\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nLabradoodle is a scardy cat when it comes to escalators\n\nFights broke out elsewhere during the Black Friday sales. At the Buckle store in Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Alabama, a mass brawl which began with two women shut down the whole shopping center\n\nBoth of the women in the Buckle Store brawl were arrested. Police have since revealed that their fight was personal and not shopping-related\n\nThe violence was even more severe elsewhere in Missouri, where a 19-year-old man was shot outside a mall as shoppers rushed to snap up cut-price goods inside. He is in a critical condition.\n\nNeither incident of violence in Missouri and Alabama were sparked by fights over sale items, according to local police.\n\nFor the most part, the shopping was civilized and, in some cases, orderly.\n\nAt the Mall of America in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2,500 lined up neatly in rows for the doors opening at 5am.\n\nOthers camped outside a Walmart in Massachusetts which opened at 1am and will remain open until 11pm on Friday night, giving bargain hunters almost 24 hours of uninterrupted shopping.\n\nTraditionally, most on-the-ground shopping is done on Black Friday and online shoppers wait until Cyber Monday when prices are reduced even further.\n\nBut this year at-home shoppers flooded retail websites early, causing some, including Lowes home improvements, to crash.\n\nBetween Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday, sales are predicted to hit $19.7 billion.\n\nThe NRF expects holiday retail sales in November and December - excluding automobiles, gasoline and restaurants - to increase between 3.6 and 4 per cent for a total of $678.75 billion to $682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year.\n\nUS stores had to get creative this year with tricks to lure shoppers off the internet and back into the thick of it.\n\nAt BJ's in Northborough, Massachusetts, people filled their shopping carts with wine, TVs and toilet paper as the sales got underway\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\n'Get clean and sober' Sharon Osbourne on Meghan Markle's father\n\nWatch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nBritish diver involved in Thai soccer team rescue feared the worst\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nBeaming Prince Harry and Meghan open Nelson Mandela exhibition\n\nWatch video\n\n'My view has not changed' FBI Director Chris Wray on Russia\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave lion cub forced to jump into raging river to follow mother\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nLabradoodle is a scardy cat when it comes to escalators\n\nOne video taken at a Walmart in south Chicago shows shoppers swarming over a table to pick up discounted goods.

A number of shops now also ply visitors with food and drink.\n\n'All of these retailers are desperate to get people into their stores,' said analyst Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, who added a note of caution about all the promotions.\n\n'Whether they work or not is open to debate.'\n\nWEBSITES CRASH AS ONLINE SHOPPERS GET AHEAD OF THEMSELVES BEFORE CYBER MONDAY\n\nLowes website crashed on Friday as online shoppers rushed to place orders\n\nWhile millions raced out on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday to get their hands on good deals, many are waiting to spend their cash online.\n\nOn Monday, countless more deals will appear on retailers' websites.\n\nThis year, experts predict that $6billion will be spent online on Monday alone.\n\nThe figure last year was $3.45billion, a new online sales record.\n\nIt is too soon to say whether more money will be spent on Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\n\nBy 5pm Thursday, shoppers had already spent $1.52 billion, which is a 17 per cent increase from last year.\n\nSome websites began taking online orders on Friday after putting deals online early.\n\nLowes, the home improvement retailer, buckled under the surge in traffic and its website crashed.\n\n'The site is currently offline and will be available within the next hour. Until then, we invited you to check out these other Lowes affiliated sites. Thanks for your patience,' was the message which greeted shoppers.\n\nIt was back up and running after an hour or so.\n\nMore than 800 people lined up outside a Best Buy in Irving, Texas, on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe electronics store had some of the most impressive lines with line in Tennessee snaking into the parking lot.\n\nThis year's frenzy will see Americans spend an astonishing $20billion in stores and online, according to consumer experts.\n\nExperts predict 164 million Americans will spend nearly $1,000 each over the holiday weekend.\n\nThe mayhem began at 5pm on Thanksgiving Day as thousands of bargain hunters rushed inside stores across the US in search of amazing sales, door buster deals and limited-time offers.\n\nMacy's Herald Square in Manhattan saw hundreds of people lined up outside their doors waiting to get their hands on deals like cosmetic and perfume sets from $10 to $20 as well as 40 per cent off on boots and shoes.\n\nShoppers were also seen flocking to its Apple shop for deals on gadgets like the Apple Watch.", "Netflix will invest nearly $8 billion into original content over the next year as it tries to build the world's biggest video subscription service.\n\nThe company is sinking deeper into debt in its relentless pursuit of more viewers, leaving Netflix with little margin for error.\n\nBut the big burden that Netflix is shouldering hasn't been a major concern on Wall Street so far, as CEO Reed Hastings' strategy has been paying off.\n\nThe billions of dollars that Netflix has borrowed to pay for exclusive series such as House of Cards, Stranger Things, and The Crown has helped its service more than triple its global audience during the past four years - leaving it with 109 million subscribers worldwide through September.\n\nNetflix will invest nearly $8 billion into original content over the next year. Stranger Things (pictured) is one of the company's most popular series\n\nThe billions of dollars that Netflix has borrowed to pay for exclusive series such as Stranger Things and The Crown (pictured) has helped its service more than triple its global audience\n\nHouse of Cards, which stars Kevin Spacey (pictured), was also a huge money-maker for Netflix\n\nThat figure includes 5.3 million subscribers added during the July-September period, according to Netflix's quarterly earnings report released Monday. The growth exceeded management forecasts and analyst projections.\n\nNetflix's stock rose 1 per cent in extended trading, putting it on track to touch new highs on Tuesday. The shares have increased by about five-fold during the past four years.\n\nIf the subscribers keep coming at the current pace, Netflix may surpass its role model - HBO - within the next few years. HBO started this year with 134 million subscribers worldwide.\n\n'We are running around 100 miles an hour doing our thing around the world,' Hastings said during a review of the third-quarter results.\n\nThe big burden that Netflix is shouldering hasn't been a major concern on Wall Street so far, as CEO Reed Hastings' (pictured in March) strategy has been paying off\n\nBut Netflix's subscriber growth could slow if it can't continue to win programming rights to hit TV series and movies, now that there are more competitors, including Apple , Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.\n\nIf that happens, there will be more attention on Netflix's huge programming bills, and 'then we could see an investor backlash,' CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi says. 'But Netflix has been delivering great subscriber growth so far.'\n\nNetflix's long-term debt and other obligations totaled $21.9 billion as of September 30, up from $16.8 billion at the same time last year.\n\nThat includes $17 billion for video programming, up from $14.4 billion a year ago.\n\nMost of the programming payments are due within the next five years.\n\nNetflix expects to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on programming next year, up from $6 billion this year.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California, company has to borrow to pay for most of its programming expenses because it doesn't generate enough cash on its own. Netflix burned through another $465 million in the most recent quarter, which is known as 'negative cash flow' in accounting parlance.\n\nFor all of this year, Netflix has warned that its negative cash flow might be as high as $2.5 billion, a trend that management expects will continue for at least the next several years as it tries to diversify its video library to appeal to divergent tastes in about 190 countries.\n\nNonetheless, Netflix has remained profitable, under US accounting rules. The company earned $130 million on $3 billion in revenue in its latest quarter.\n\nAnd management appears to be trying to ease the financial drain with price increases of $1 and $2 a month for most of its 53 million subscribers in the US before the end of the year.\n\nThe higher prices are likely to increase Netflix's revenue by about $650 million next year, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney predicted.\n\nBut the price increases could backfire if it provokes an unusually high number of subscribers to cancel, something Netflix faced when it raised rates in the past.\n\nMost analysts believe that's unlikely to happen this time, and Netflix supported that thesis with its growth forecast.\n\nManagement expects to add 6.3 million subscribers during the October-December period, slightly more than what analysts are anticipating, according to FactSet.\n\nNetflix has long argued its borrowing makes sense to gain a huge advantage over rivals as people increasingly watch programming on internet-connected devices\n\nNetflix has long argued its borrowing makes sense to gain a huge advantage over rivals as people increasingly watch programming on internet-connected devices. Plus, management points out that its total debt is small compared with its market value of nearly $90 billion.\n\nWith such a valuable stock, Netflix theoretically could sell more shares to raise money.\n\nBut that would be more difficult to do if Netflix's stock price plummets amid concerns about its debt.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also questions the long-term value of Netflix's programming line-up.\n\n'What is something like Season One of 'House of Cards' worth to you if you already have watched it?

With a click, the app identifies tracks playing on the radio, at parties or as background music.\n\nBut Shazam has struggled to find a way to make money off its technology, even as it said that it had reached one billion downloads on smartphones last year.\n\nShazam only recently announced it had become profitable, thanks to advertising and steering traffic to other sites such as Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThe technology is also no longer quite as novel, with Shazam facing rivals such as SoundHound and with smartphones capable of ever more advanced recognition functions.", "A full system reboot may be required if you are unlucky enough to activate it\n\nWhatsApp users are being warned about a new 'text bomb' that can cause their iOS and Android handsets to freeze.\n\nIt is being spread by messages sent via the popular app and comes in two varieties.

In what follows, we will compare the two languages on the basis of a few important parameters.\n\nThe iOS app vs Android app development debate will rage on for many times to come. While potential profitability is an important factor, mobile app developers are also divided in their opinions as to whether Java (required for Android development) or Objective-C (required for iOS development) is an easier, more useful language. Contrary to what many beginners believe, Apple Swift is NOT a substitute for Objective C. Over here, we will compare the two programming languages based on some key parameters:\n\nThe presence of Grand Central dispatch at the operating system level is a significant advantage of Objective-C. On the flipside, it does not have any built-in tool support, unlike Java -- in which remote system class downloading is supported. Both the languages have their specific plus points -- the wider acceptance of Java is countered by Apple's dedicated support for Objective-C. It would be fair to say that the final say as to which one is a 'better' language depends on the proficiency of individual developers.\n\nWhich one do you feel is the easier and more user-friendly language? Let us know in the comment below!", "BRUSSELS -- European regulators came down hard on another U.S. tech giant Wednesday, fining Google a record $5 billion Wednesday for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine, the ruling could hurt the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple. The company must deposit the money in a holding account while the legal process unfolds. If it ultimately loses the appeal, the fine will be distributed among the EU's member states.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anti-competitive behavior.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some U.S. politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and \"should lead US enforcers to protect consumers.\" Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the largest market share: Google's Search and Chrome apps, and its Play Store app marketplace.\n\nThe EU gave Google 90 days to come up with remedies that could allow rival search apps and browsers onto more phones. Failure to comply risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone-makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion-euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"The important thing is not to be distracted by the size of the fine. What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nMozilla Corp., which makes the Firefox search engine, said it hoped the EU investigation \"will help level the playing field for mobile browser.\" DuckDuckGo Inc., a search engine that doesn't track users, said Google's actions have \"led directly to us having less market share on Android.\"\n\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone-makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating even Apple's iOS.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone-makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone-makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nGoogle argues that letting phone-makers choose their apps could hurt the company's main means of making money through Android -- advertising and the sale of content and apps. Apple, in contrast, makes most of its money from the sale of devices.\n\nGiving phone-makers more freedom to use altered versions of Android could also hurt Google. Samsung, a hugely popular maker of Android phones, could, for example, break off and take much of the Android system with it. Samsung had no immediate comment.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, said the ruling \"is a blow to innovative, open-source business models.\"\n\nThe main complainant against Google was FairSearch, a Brussels-based lobbying group that has been backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and Nokia. It called the ruling \"an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behavior.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes.

The fault is mine and mine alone,\" came Musk's apology.\n\nIt was caveated, however, with a preamble detailing the reasons behind his outburst: \"my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader,\" he explained, before adhering to investors' demands for a public apology.\n\nIf all this makes you hark back to the days your mum would make you issue a public apology to your siblings or you'd go without dessert/toys/TV, then you're not alone. Except in Musk's case it's the future of his EV empire that's at stake, not just his bedtime.\n\nIn case you're not up to speed, Musk, whose \"kid-sized\" submarine proved ultimately redundant in aiding the Thai cave rescue, recently lashed out a diver involved in rescue efforts, calling him a \"pedo\". The unfounded accusation elicited righteous anger from its recipient, diver Vernon Unsworth, who is rumoured to be considering legal action.\n\nTesla's investors are more than a tad concerned about Musk's comments, and what they mean for the future of the firm. Musk's unwieldy Twitter attacks \"could have a dramatic negative impact on the company,\" mused Gene Munster, head of research at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, to The Guardian.

Musk, angered by the criticism, claimed he would make a video proving the viability of the submarine, closing his Twitter tirade with \"Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it\".\n\nIt's hardly model behaviour from one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in the world - lobbing baseless accusations of \"pedo\" is behaviour more often confined to secondary school playgrounds (see: every Inbetweeners episode).

Sorry really does seem to be the hardest word.", "The German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA) retroactively reversed a \u20ac4,000 environmental bonus that many Tesla Model S buyers had already received, based on a technicality.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is a stipulation in the Guideline on the Promotion of Sales of Electric Vehicles that mandates that the base model of vehicles eligible for the environmental subsidy must be available for customers to purchase for under \u20ac60,000. They have to be able to take delivery of such a trim in order to be eligible for the bonus. Half of the bonus is provided by the government and half of the bonus is paid by the manufacturer.\n\nThe government alleges that Tesla was not allowing customers to order and take delivery of the lowest optioned Tesla Model S, which would make all of its Model S vehicles ineligible for the bonus. This was discovered in late 2017, and after an investigation, the Model S was removed from the list of vehicles eligible for the environmental bonus on November 30th, 2017.\n\nBAFA claims that it was not until March 6th, 2018 that the base model configuration of the Model S was made available to customers. Ironically, this nuance penalizes Tesla owners who purchased higher trimmed models and paid a premium to drive electric.\n\nTesla had been in negotiations with the regulatory body in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, but unfortunately for Tesla's customers, no agreement was reached by early July, as required. The result: Tesla's customers that purchased a Model S in the contested period will have to pay back the full \u20ac4,000 subsidy.\n\nBAFA clarified the terms of the reversal (via Google Translate):\n\n\"The reversal affects all Tesla customers who purchased the 'Tesla Model S' before March 6, 2018. This includes around 800 procedures in which the environmental bonus has already been approved. In addition, this includes around 250 procedures that were initially postponed due to the unclear facts in the processing and must now be rejected.\"\n\nBAFA's ruling ends with a note that as of March 6th, 2018, buyers of a Tesla Model S are eligible for the rebate, followed by a link to apply for it online.\n\nIn typical Tesla format, it is jumping in the way of the oncoming train to protect its customers, for the time being. A Tesla spokesperson shared with CleanTechnica the following statement:\n\n\"The arbitrary decision to temporarily remove Tesla from the list of vehicles eligible for the Environmental Bonus (Umweltbonus) was unjustified, contrary to the stated goals of the program, and unfair to our customers. The fact that Tesla was included on the list, removed from the list, and then again added to the list is proof that this was a mistake.

Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great.\"Water level was actually very low ... you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in.

But leading scientists and tech innovators have signaled that such autonomous killers could materialize in the real world in frighteningly real ways.\n\nDuring the annual International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Stockholm on Wednesday, some of the world's top scientific minds came together to sign a pledge that calls for \"laws against lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\n\"... we the undersigned agree that the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine,\" the pledge says. It goes on to say, \"... we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\nThe moniker \"autonomous weapons\" doesn't draw the same fear or wonder as a killer robot, but weapons that can function without human oversight are a real concern.\n\nIn the pledge introduced by the Future of Life Institute, signees agree that AI developments can contribute to future danger. Those backing the pledge include SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk and Google DeepMind co-founders Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. They are among more than 170 organizations and 2,400 individuals to take such a stance, according to the document.\n\n\"There is a moral component to this position, that we should not allow machines to make life-taking decisions for which others - or nobody - will be culpable,\" the pledge states. \"There is also a powerful pragmatic argument: lethal autonomous weapons, selecting and engaging targets without human intervention, would be dangerously destabilizing for every country and individual.\"\n\nThe position of the pledge is ultimately to encourage global governments to take legal action to ban any possibility of future destruction.\n\n\"Stigmatizing and preventing such an arms race should be a high priority for national and global security,\" the pledge states.\n\nThis isn't the first time AI leaders have expressed doubts.\n\nLast August, corporate tech leaders wrote an open letter to the United Nations warning of an arms race in these weapons.\n\nSuch weapons, the letter said, \"threaten to become the third revolution in warfare. Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend.\"\n\nMusk also signed that letter and he spoke on his strong beliefs concerning the inevitable dangers associated with AI. He urged U.S. governors to be proactive. \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid. As they should be,\" he said in July 2017.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with Musk dire view. In an interview with NPR, Rep. Pete Olsen, R-Texas, expressed his optimism for the future of AI.\n\n\"These are machines that are learning over time from activities they've done,\" Olsen said. \"They become sort of intelligent through that learning.

The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nThe businessman had got his team to build a mini-submarine to help with the rescue. But the contraption, which was brought to Thailand, was not used during the mission. Unsworth had later said that the mini-submarine was not practical and that the move was a \"publicity stunt\" by Musk. On Sunday, a miffed Musk launched a scathing attack on Unsworth. In a series of now-deleted tweets, he said he would release video footage of one of the mini-submarines easily navigating one of the caves.\n\nMusk then made the baseless claim that Unsworth was a paedophile, tweeting, \"Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nUnsworth later said he was considering legal action against the Tesla CEO for his comments.\n\nMusk's apology came after Tesla investors posted an open letter online on Tuesday. \"The exchange with Vern Unsworth crossed the line,\" wrote Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Minneapolis and New York. \"I suspect you would agree given you deleted the string from Twitter, but it will take more than that to regain investor confidence.\"\n\n\"Over the last six months, there have been too many examples of concerning behavior that is shaking investor confidence,\" the letter said, pointing out several instances of Musk's alleged outbursts since March. The investors further said Musk's behaviour was \"fueling an unhelpful perception\" of his leadership, calling it \"thin-skinned and short-tempered\".\n\nMusk's behaviour \"could have a dramatic negative impact on the company\", Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures, told The Guardian on Tuesday. \"It has to start with an apology.\"", "Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has apologized for his part in a spat with a British diver involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Musk had tweeted a personal attack on Vern Unsworth, calling him a pedophile after the diver dismissed Musk's offer of help with a vulgar comment.\n\nMusk wrote, \"My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader.\"\n\nMusk had offered to build and supply a minisub to get the boys and their coach out of the flooded cave, at a time when officials worried that it could be weeks or months before they could be rescued.\n\nThai navy SEAL divers rescued all 13 last week; days later, Unsworth dismissed Musk's minisub offer as a \"PR stunt\" that wouldn't have worked. He also said Musk could \"stick his submarine where it hurts.\"\n\nThe founder of Tesla and SpaceX responded by challenging Unsworth, saying a video would prove his idea was valid. Musk then added, \"You know what, don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nMusk's calling Unsworth a pedophile surprised many -- and the episode was seen as playing a role in a sudden 4 percent drop in Tesla's stock price.\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk said in a tweet that Unsworth's \"actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader.\"\n\n\"The fault is mine and mine alone,\" Musk said.\n\nMusk's Twitter feed has long been the source of news about his company's innovations and ambitions -- as well as a platform for him to try to correct the record when he feels a distorted view of himself or his projects has emerged. Over the weekend, for instance, Musk devoted several tweets to clarify his political stance and donations.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a Twitter user named Lane Roberts urged Musk to \"regulate your tweets\" -- in large part, Roberts said, because negativity could overshadow his efforts to help improve life on a broad scale.", "The Terminator's killer robots may seem like a thing of science fiction. But leading scientists and tech innovators have signaled that such autonomous killers could materialize in the real world in frighteningly real ways.\n\nDuring the annual International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Stockholm on Wednesday, some of the world's top scientific minds came together to sign a pledge that calls for \"laws against lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\n\"... we the undersigned agree that the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine,\" the pledge says. It goes on to say, \"... we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\nThe moniker \"autonomous weapons\" doesn't draw the same fear or wonder as a killer robot, but weapons that can function without human oversight are a real concern.\n\nIn the pledge introduced by the Future of Life Institute, signees agree that AI developments can contribute to future danger. Those backing the pledge include SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk and Google DeepMind co-founders Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. They are among more than 170 organizations and 2,400 individuals to take such a stance, according to the document.\n\n\"There is a moral component to this position, that we should not allow machines to make life-taking decisions for which others - or nobody - will be culpable,\" the pledge states. \"There is also a powerful pragmatic argument: lethal autonomous weapons, selecting and engaging targets without human intervention, would be dangerously destabilizing for every country and individual.\"\n\nThe position of the pledge is ultimately to encourage global governments to take legal action to ban any possibility of future destruction.\n\n\"Stigmatizing and preventing such an arms race should be a high priority for national and global security,\" the pledge states.\n\nThis isn't the first time AI leaders have expressed doubts.\n\nLast August, corporate tech leaders wrote an open letter to the United Nations warning of an arms race in these weapons.\n\nSuch weapons, the letter said, \"threaten to become the third revolution in warfare. Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend.\"\n\nMusk also signed that letter and he spoke on his strong beliefs concerning the inevitable dangers associated with AI. He urged U.S. governors to be proactive. \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid. As they should be,\" he said in July 2017.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with Musk dire view. In an interview with NPR, Rep. Pete Olsen, R-Texas, expressed his optimism for the future of AI.\n\n\"These are machines that are learning over time from activities they've done,\" Olsen said. \"They become sort of intelligent through that learning. This is the great value, great tremendous benefit for our country.\"", "Experts warn autonomous weapons \"could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression\" and \"easily spark an arms race\" worldwide.\n\nThousands of artificial intelligence (AI) experts and developers have signed a pledge vowing to \"neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons,\" and imploring governments worldwide to work together to \"create a future with strong international norms, regulations, and laws\" barring so-called killer robots.\n\nMore than 160 companies and groups from three dozen countries and 2,400 individuals from 90 countries are backing the pledge, which was developed by the Boston-based Future of Life Institute (FLI) and unveiled Wednesday during the annual International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n\"I'm excited to see AI leaders shifting from talk to action, implementing a policy that politicians have thus far failed to put into effect,\" declared FLI president and MIT professor Max Tegmark. \"AI has huge potential to help the world -- if we stigmatize and prevent its abuse. AI weapons that autonomously decide to kill people are as disgusting and destabilizing as bioweapons, and should be dealt with in the same way.\"\n\nAs Anthony Aguirre, a professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz and pledge signatory, told CNN, \"We would really like to ensure that the overall impact of the technology is positive and not leading to a terrible arms race, or a dystopian future with robots flying around killing everybody.\"\n\nSignatory Yoshua Bengio, an AI expert at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, explained that the pledge has the potential to sway public opinion by shaming developers of killer robots, also referred to called lethal autonomous weapons systems.\n\n\"This approach actually worked for land mines, thanks to international treaties and public shaming, even though major countries like the U.S. did not sign the treaty banning land mines,\" Bengio pointed out in an interview with the Guardian. \"American companies have stopped building land mines.\"\n\nLucy Suchman, a professor at England's Lancaster University, emphasized the importance of AI researchers staying involved with how their inventions are used, noting that as a developer she would, \"first, commit to tracking the subsequent uses of my technologies and speaking out against their application to automating target recognition and, second, refuse to participate in either advising or directly helping to incorporate the technology into an autonomous weapon system.\"\n\nOther high-profile supporters of the pledge include SpaceX and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk; Skype founder Jaan Tallinn; Jeffrey Dean, Google's lead of research and machine intelligence; and Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founders of DeepMind.\n\nAs AI technology has continued to advance, the United Nations has convened a group of governmental experts to address mounting concerns raised by human rights organizations, advocacy groups, military leaders, lawmakers, and tech experts -- many who, for years, have demanded a global ban on killer robots.\n\nIn recent years, tech experts have used IJCAI as an opportunity to pressure world leaders to outlaw autonomous weapons which, as the new pledge warns, \"could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression, especially when linked to surveillance and data systems.\" Without a ban on such weaponry, they \"could too easily spark an arms race that the international community lacks the technical tools and global governance systems to manage.\"\n\nTop Photo | Chinese students work on the Ares, a humanoid bipedal robot designed to help transform the country into a global leader in artificial intelligence. (AP/Ng Han Guan)", "Musk called Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, and asked that he make public more than US$6 million in contributions to the anonymous group.\n\nWASHINGTON: Elon Musk personally dialled up the head of the environmental group the Sierra Club and asked for help with deflecting criticism over donations that the chairman of Tesla Inc. made to Republicans, according to an email that the head of the nonprofit sent to his staff.\n\nMusk on Saturday called Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, and asked that he make public more than US$6 million in contributions to the group that had been anonymous, Brune wrote in the email. Musk also enlisted Brune to vouch for him on Twitter to quell a firestorm over the billionaire's US$38,900 contribution to a committee that benefits congressional Republicans including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nBrune is now dealing with blow-back within his own organization for complying with Musk's requests. Two posts from his personal account and one sent from the Sierra Club's Twitter handle that was laudatory of Tesla's chief executive officer and his commitment to fighting climate change rankled some Sierra Club staff. They objected to Brune's defence of an executive who funds Republicans and has bashed the United Auto Workers.\n\n\"I appreciate the concerns that I've seen online and in an email that the tweets may be at odds with our support for workers' rights and defeat the GOP agenda across the country,\" Brune wrote in the email to his staff on Tuesday. \"I don't agree, but I see the risk and understand the concerns. Musk has made unhelpful anti-union statements and Tesla's labour practices are also cause for concern, so I take your comments seriously.\"\n\nA representative for Sierra Club declined to comment. A spokesperson for Musk said in an emailed statement that he is \"committed to backing the Sierra Club in its fight for clean energy and recently asked them to make his support public to reaffirm the sincerity of his commitment.\"\n\n\"Elon has spent most of his career fighting to prevent climate change and protect the environment,\" the spokesperson said in the statement. \"Almost every major carmaker in the world is accelerating development of electric cars primarily because of what Elon and his team have achieved with Tesla. He has also made significant philanthropic contributions to organizations seeking to end the use of fossil fuels, including $6 million to the Sierra Club.\"\n\nMusk, 47, defended himself on Saturday in a series of tweets by denying that he's a top donor to the GOP or any political party. He also wrote that his contribution to a committee known as Protect the House was about 0.5% of what he donated to the Sierra Club and said this was \"a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue.\"\n\nIn another post, he said he donated to the PAC that benefits Republicans \"so that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity.\"\n\nLaudatory tweets\n\nBrune joined the fray, tweeting from his personal account over the weekend that Musk \"has spent his career focused on tackling the climate crisis & advancing clean energy\" and that the Sierra Club is \" proud of Elon's support of our work.\"\n\n\"There have got to be better topics of debate than whether @elonmusk is committed to climate action,\" Brune wrote in the tweet posted from the Sierra Club's official account. Musk quoted that post and wrote back in a post that he pinned to the top of his feed: \"Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.\"\n\nIn the email to Sierra Club staff, Brune said that it was Musk's right to request that his previously anonymous donations be made public, and said the group would have granted that request to any donor.\n\nMusk \"asked for some help via Twitter, not about the PAC donation but to buttress the criticism that his commitment to ending fossil fuels was fake,\" Brune wrote in the email. \"I agreed.\"", "Elon Musk probably hopes the matter of him baselessly smearing one of the divers who helped rescue a Thai soccer team from a flooded cave complex as a \"pedo guy\" is resolved with his issuance of a half-assed apology on Wednesday. However, the question of whether he will face a lawsuit lingers on -- as does the mess resulting from his other, somewhat less high-profile Twitter controversy of the last week.\n\nAs heat mounted on @elonmusk for a $38,900 donation he gave to a pro-Republican PAC last quarter this weekend, he apparently asked environmental advocacy group the Sierra Club for a favor: Can you make my anonymous $6 million-plus donations no longer anonymous? Per Bloomberg, which obtained an email from Sierra Club executive Michael Brune to staff, Musk made the appeal in the form of a phone call in which he asked if Brune could personally vouch for him on Twitter.\n\nBrune did, and it apparently did not go well. Bloomberg writes:\n\nBrune is now dealing with blow-back within his own organization for complying with Musk's requests. Two posts from his personal account and one sent from the Sierra Club's Twitter handle that were laudatory of Tesla's chief executive officer and his commitment to fighting climate change rankled some Sierra Club staff. They objected to Brune's defense of an executive who funds Republicans and has bashed the United Auto Workers.\n\nHere's the tweets Brune sent from his personal account:\n\nHere is the one from the Sierra Club, which was just as forthright in dismissing concerns that Musk's donations indicated a lack of commitment to climate issues:\n\nIn his email to staff, Bloomberg wrote, Brune said that he would have granted the request to make a previously anonymous donation public to any donor. He also said he took seriously concerns from staff who felt that praising Musk -- who has reportedly long resisted United Auto Workers unionization attempts at Tesla's Fremont, California production plant -- was a bad look given Brune is a co-chair of the BlueGreen alliance partnership between unions and environmental groups.\n\nBloomberg writes:\n\n\"I appreciate the concerns that I've seen online and in email that the tweets may be at odds with our support for workers' rights and defeating the GOP agenda across the country,\" Brune wrote in the email to his staff on Tuesday. \"I don't agree, but I see the risk and understand the concerns. Musk has made unhelpful anti-union statements and Tesla's labor practices are also cause for concern, so I take your comments seriously.\"\n\nGiven that the Environmental Protection Agency is currently run by former fossil-fuel lobbyists and Donald Trump's White House has gleefully taken the hacksaw to virtually all federal climate change mitigation and preparation efforts, the Sierra Club probably has better things to do than get bogged down in a Musk tweet controversy. Similarly, Musk probably had better things to do (like ensuring his Tesla plant stays out of \"manufacturing hell\") than create one.", "Musk's spat with Unsworth started last week after CEO's submarine was rejected\n\nA British caver who helped rescue 12 boys from a Thai cave said today that he has been approached by British and American lawyers and will seek legal advice after Tesla CEO Elon Musk directed abuse at him on Twitter.\n\n'I've been approached by British lawyers, American lawyers. I haven't decided what to do next yet,' Vern Unsworth told Reuters in Mae Sai town in Chiang Rai province, about 2 miles from the cave where the boys and their coach were trapped for 18 days.\n\nUnsworth said he hadn't flatly denied Musk's accusation because he was waiting for legal advice.\n\nAsked why he thought Musk would make such a comment about him, he said: 'I don't know.'\n\nVernon Unsworth has suggested he plans to take legal action after Elon Musk accused him of being a paedophile in an extraordinary Twitter attack\n\nMusk labelled the British diver 'pedo guy' in a tweet and when challenged on the remark added 'bet ya a signed dollar it's true' before deleting both messages\n\nUnsworth said he hadn't flatly denied Musk's accusation because he was waiting for legal advice. Pictured: Musk doubling down on his claims\n\nHowever, Unsworth has said he is considering legal action against the billionaire entrepreneur, who is chief executive of the electric car maker Tesla Inc.\n\n'I can't let it go. There's too much out there already,' Unsworth told Reuters in an interview. Asked which law firm he would hire, he said: 'I don't know yet. I have to take advice.'\n\nUnsworth declined to identify who had approached him.\n\nTesla spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk could not be reached for comment.\n\nMusk's spat with Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk's offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help extract the youth soccer team and the coach from the labyrinth of partly flooded passages.\n\nMusk also shared images of the camp which has been established around the cave mouth\n\nThe tech billionaire also tweeted images from inside the cave as rescuers attempted to save the final four boys and their 25-year-old coach who is still trapped\n\nMembers of the 'Wild Boars' football team being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai after their rescue\n\nRescue personnel work at the Tham Luang cave complex in the northern province of Chiang Rai\n\n'It just has absolutely no chance of working,' CNN quoted Unsworth as saying about the submarine.\n\nMusk responded on Twitter on Sunday saying: 'We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.'\n\nThe Tweet was later deleted.\n\nA police officer in the Chiang Rai, where Unsworth has lived for seven years, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth. The officer declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nUnsworth, 63, said he hadn't actually met Musk face to face when Musk visited the cave during the rescue.\n\nHe said he felt sorry that the squabble with Musk had detracted from the successful end to the rescue mission.\n\n'It's taken a bit of the pleasure out of what's happened, what we've achieved, for me anyway,' he said, adding that it had upset his ex-wife and daughter back in Britain. 'It's very much upset my daughter,' the caver said, his voice breaking.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc fell more than 3.5 per cent on Monday, knocking almost $2 billion off the company's market value.\n\nSeveral analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk's comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla's main business of producing electric cars.\n\nThe 'Wild Boar' team were rescued last week by a group of foreign and Thai divers through a network of narrow passages and chambers. The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach are expected to leave hospital on Wednesday.\n\nMusk took aim at Osottanakorn in a barbed tweet on Tuesday afternoon in which he downplayed his role in the rescue and suggested a man named Dick Stanton was the expert\n\nUnsworth was the first foreigner called to the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand after relatives noticed the boys had not come out after setting out to explore the cave complex on June 23 following soccer practice.\n\nHe said he has lost count of how many times he has been inside the 6-mile long Tham Luang cave.\n\n'It has been my third home for the past six years,' he said.\n\nTwo British divers who were asked by Unsworth to join the mission were the first to discover the boys.\n\nUnsworth said he brought his knowledge about the cave to the rescue mission but added that he 'no idea' what the diving conditions were like because he is not a cave diver.\n\nHe said he will fly from Thailand to London on Thursday, where he will stay for around three weeks.\n\nWHAT WAS ELON MUSK'S PLAN TO SAVE THE THAI CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FLOODED TUNNELS?\n\nTwelve young footballers and their 25-year-old coach became trapped in a flooded cave system in Thailand on June 23, 2018.\n\nDivers and other rescue worker worked frantically to come up with a plan to free the youngsters imprisoned in the Tham Luang Nang Non caves.\n\nOn July 6, almost two weeks later, billionaire Elon Musk shared suggestions for those working on the ground after receiving tweets requesting his input.\n\nElon Musk said his Boring Co, which digs tunnels for advanced transport systems, could feed a nylon tube into the submerged sections of the cave before inflating it 'like a bouncy castle' to create an underwater tunnel.\n\nMusk also committed to sending top engineers from his Boring Co. and SpaceX companies to help free the trapped schoolchildren.\n\nAccording to the Tesla CEO, rescuers could use electric pumps to remove water from flooded entrance of the cave network - eliminating one of the bodies of water those trapped would need to cross.\n\nNylon tubes measuring some 3ft (1m) in diameter could then be fed through the cave network to the flooded sections.\n\nBattery packs and air pumps would be used to inflate the nylon tubes, submerged underwater. These tubes would provide an escape tunnel the children could crawl through to safety, Musk suggests.\n\nHowever, Professor John Gunn from the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham and chair of the cave research association, had reservations about details of the scheme.\n\nHe said: 'If you imagine a tunnel under London flooded, this this would be straight with a few bends.\n\n'However, this is more like asking to thread a pipe through all the aisles of a supermarket, up the stairs, down the stairs and then back through the aisles and also in total darkness and underwater.\n\n'You can see it is more complicated. If he was proposing the pipe is moved by divers then I think that's a non-starter.'\n\nTRAPPED THAI SOCCER TEAM DUG A FIVE-YARD TUNNEL IN A BID TO ESCAPE FLOODED CAVE\n\nThe navy doctor who stayed with the 12 trapped kids and their football coach in a Thailand cave has revealed how the youngsters tried to dig their way to freedom.\n\nImpressed with 'their optimism and great morale', Lt Col Dr Pak Loharachun wrote that the children used bits of rock in a bid to escape.\n\n'Every day, the kids dug a hole into a wall with rock fragments to find a way out,' he said.\n\nMembers of the trapped Thai soccer team used rock fragments to dig holes in the walls of the Tham Luang mountain cave complex\n\n'They managed to dig five metres deep although they had nothing to eat,' Loharachun added in a Facebook post, according to Bangkok post.\n\nHe went on to say the Wild Boars team has better physical and mental health than expected, courtesy of their 'dedicated' coach who had taken care of them.\n\nThe coach reputedly allowed the boys to eat first before taking his own meal.\n\nLoharachun also noted that the kids were so well disciplined that they always put garbage in black plastic bags after every meal.", "The forthcoming Porsche Taycan (formerly known as the Mission E) isn't set to arrive until 2020, but the vehicle's impressive specs and sleek design have already resulted in an influx of orders for the highly-anticipated EV. What's more, interest in the Taycan is climbing despite the fact that a final production model has yet to be revealed. Indeed, all of the photos and videos we've seen thus far have featured prototypes.\n\nRegardless, prospective consumers are seemingly all too eager to snatch up Porsche's answer to Tesla's Model S. Speaking to Autocar, Alexander Pollich -- who currently serves as the Managing Director of Porsche Deutschland -- explained that Porsche has seen an immense interest in the Taycan.\n\n\"The reaction from customers has been fantastic,\" Pollich said. \"From the moment we announced the car to now, when we have asked customers to register their interest for the first cars.\"\n\n\"The next 18 months will be fascinating, as we develop and reveal the car, but what is already clear is that customers are keen,\" Pollich added. \"They are talking to our dealers asking how to get to the top of the priority lists and asking to access more information.\"\n\nAnd with good reason, the Porsche Taycan's specs are truly impressive. Specifically, the car will reportedly feature a 0-62 MPH time of 3.5 seconds and a top speed that maxes out above 155 MPH. With respect to day-to-day performance, Porsche has said that the Taycan will be able to travel 310 miles on a single charge. Further, the Taycan will be able to take advantage of high-voltage superchargers and juice up to 250 miles of range after just 20 minutes of charging. And last but not least, the Taycan will sport a price tag in the $85,000 range, making it comparable to a tricked out Model S.\n\nOn a related note, Pollich took some time to praise Tesla for kickstarting the EV revolution:\n\nThey have been the pioneers and they have set a big challenge. What's clear is that at Porsche we are planning to rise to that challenge, not just with our car, but in providing owners with the full 360 degree view to allow seamless ownership, including creating a supercharger network.\n\nIncidentally, Porsche seems to be intent on embracing the EV revolution with open arms. Earlier this year, Porsche CEO Oliver Blume intimated that the entirety of Porsche's product line may be fully electric by 2030.", "Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to be actively pursuing his plan of using technology for electoral gains. On Thursday morning, the prime minister will interact with people from villages that have been electrified across India since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) came to power in 2014.\n\nIt's not new for Modi to try and reach people in the rural areas using targeted communication; even those places which aren't synonymous with technological development. Through initiatives such as the 'Narendra Modi Mobil App', Digital India, his radio address Mann Ki Baat, Twitter, MyGov portal etc., the prime minister has been using unconventional channels of communication to deliver his message to the masses.\n\nIn October 2013, Modi had a mere 2.48 million followers on Twitter. That number has today swollen to 43.1 million on the micro-blogging site, making him the third most followed leader on Twitter after US president Donald Trump and Pope Francis.\n\nFile image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Courtesy: narendramodi.in\n\nBe it talking to women self-help groups, or launching a survey on the NaMo App to assess the four years of governance, Modi has been pushing to use technology as a means for \"development, not destruction\". Till date, the NaMo App has been downloaded over 50 lakh times.\n\nSpeaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai in February this year, Modi had warned against the misuse of technology and said, \"On the other side, we are investing large portions of money, time and resources in missiles and bombs. We must use technology as a means to development, not destruction.\"\n\nAccording to Modi's official website, he views \"technology as something that is easy, effective and economical, combining speed, simplicity and service\".\n\nDuring his tenure as prime minister, Modi has also visited tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Tesla in US' Silicon Valley and met with tech entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. During a visit to the US in 2015, Musk even gave Modi a tour of Tesla Motors and the two discussed how technology can aid development, particularly in rural areas and in agriculture.\n\nModi has used technology to talk directly with farmers, the beneficiaries of the central schemes and upcoming entrepreneurs of Digital India. \"It is altogether an innovative way of establishing connect between the ruler and the ruled,\" wrote Ajay Singh for Firstpost.\n\nTechnology during the 2014 Lok Sabha campaign\n\nIt's not like Modi's thrust on technology suddenly manifested after he became prime minister; it actually played a crucial role in his campaigning during the 2014 general elections as well.\n\nHe addressed more than 800 rallies at the time through the use of a hologram, allowing him to speak to the world's largest electorate at rallies across dozens of remote towns. It was believed to be the first use of hologram technology in a general election in India, according to The Telegraph.\n\nSocial media also became a vital political campaign tool, and Modi managed to reach out to first-time voters to help a 'Like' transform into a vote. According to a Quartz report, Modi had eight million followers on Facebook in 2013, a number which crossed 11 million by the time the general elections were announced on 6 March, 2014. By 12 May, 2014, he was the second most-liked politician on the social media platform, only after Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to Business Today, the launch of NaMo smartphones, Modi-related phone apps, Modi games and even Modi ringtones were commonplace during the Lok Sabha election campaign in 2014. Google Play Store even had a string of apps based on Modi, including games such as 'Super NaMo' which challenged players to survive through the ups and downs of politics and 'Modi Run', which was similar to 'Temple Run', where the he moved through states, collected votes and became the prime minister.\n\nAs reported earlier on a Firstpost article, as Modi is likely to continue using a scientific pattern for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well instead of the common \"something for everybody\" strategy.\n\nUpdated Date: Jul 19, 2018 08:56 AM", "AI experts have warned that a South Korean University is in the process of developing a secret robot army that could destroy humanity.\n\nTop academics claim the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Kaist) is working with weapons manufacturer Hanwha Systems to develop the technology.\n\nMore than 50 leading academics from 30 different countries have now signed a letter boycotting the institution and expressing concern about its AI plans.\n\nCalling it a 'Pandora's box', the experts believe AI and automated killing droids should not be used as weapons of war.\n\nExperts are distressed at the possibility of AI robots being developed for malicious purposes and claim it could lead to a third revolution in warfare.\n\nExperts are distressed at the possibility of AI robots being developed for malicious purposes and claim it could lead to a third revolution in warfare.

The believe it would allow war to be fought faster and at a scale greater than ever before\n\nWHY ARE PEOPLE SO WORRIED ABOUT AI?\n\nIt is an issue troubling some of the greatest minds in the world at the moment, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk described AI as our 'biggest existential threat' and likened its development as 'summoning the demon'.\n\nHe believes super intelligent machines could use humans as pets.\n\nProfessor Stephen Hawking said it is a 'near certainty' that a major technological disaster will threaten humanity in the next 1,000 to 10,000 years.\n\nThey could steal jobs\n\nMore than 60 percent of people fear that robots will lead to there being fewer jobs in the next ten years, according to a 2016 YouGov survey.\n\nAnd 27 percent predict that it will decrease the number of jobs 'a lot' with previous research suggesting admin and service sector workers will be the hardest hit.\n\nAs well as posing a threat to our jobs, other experts believe AI could 'go rogue' and become too complex for scientists to understand.\n\nA quarter of the respondents predicted robots will become part of everyday life in just 11 to 20 years, with 18 percent predicting this will happen within the next decade.\n\nThey could 'go rogue'\n\nComputer scientist Professor Michael Wooldridge said AI machines could become so intricate that engineers don't fully understand how they work.\n\nIf experts don't understand how AI algorithms function, they won't be able to predict when they fail.\n\nThis means driverless cars or intelligent robots could make unpredictable 'out of character' decisions during critical moments, which could put people in danger.\n\nFor instance, the AI behind a driverless car could choose to swerve into pedestrians or crash into barriers instead of deciding to drive sensibly.\n\nThey could wipe out humanity\n\nSome people believe AI will wipe out humans completely.\n\n'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent interview.\n\nHe singled out artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number one risk for this century'.\n\nMusk warned that AI poses more of a threat to humanity than North Korea.\n\n'If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,' the 46-year-old wrote on Twitter.\n\n'Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.'\n\nMusk has consistently advocated for governments and private institutions to apply regulations on AI technology.\n\nHe has argued that controls are necessary in order protect machines from advancing out of human control\n\nProfessor Toby Walsh told CNN he was mostly satisfied with Shin's remarks.\n\nThe organisers of the boycott have not yet said whether it will continue following the Kaist President's statement.\n\n'I still have a few question marks about what they intend to do but broadly speaking they have responded appropriately,' Professor Walsh said.\n\nSouth Korean forces have already installed a team of robots along the border with North Korea. The Samsung SGR-A1 carries a machine gun that can be switched to autonomous mode but is, at present, operated by humans via camera links\n\nUntil the boycott is lifted, academics will refuse to collaborate with any part of Kaist.\n\nThis includes visiting Kaist, hosting visitors from the academic institution or contributing to any research project it is involved in.\n\nNext week in Geneva, 123 member nations of the UN will discuss the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons, or killer robots, with 22 of these nations calling for an outright ban on such weapons.\n\nIn a similar way to chemical and nuclear warfare, some people think the arena of war should not be populated with autonomous killing machines.\n\nSouth Korean forces have already installed a team of robots along the border with North Korea.\n\nThe Samsung SGR-A1 carries a machine gun that can be switched to autonomous mode but is, at present, operated by humans via camera links.\n\nACADEMICS BOYCOTT KAIST OVER AI FEARS: HERE'S THEIR WARNING LETTER IN-FULL\n\nOpen Letter to Professor Sung-Chul Shin, President of KAIST\n\nAs researchers and engineers working on artificial intelligence and robotics, we are greatly concerned by the opening of a 'Research Center for the Convergence of National Defense and Artificial Intelligence' at KAIST in collaboration with Hanwha Systems, South Korea's leading arms company.\n\nIt has been reported that the goals of this Center are to 'develop artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to be applied to military weapons, joining the global competition to develop autonomous arms.'\n\nAt a time when the United Nations is discussing how to contain the threat posed to international security by autonomous weapons, it is regrettable that a prestigious institution like KAIST looks to accelerate the arms race to develop such weapons.\n\nWe therefore publicly declare that we will boycott all collaborations with any part of KAIST until such time as the President of KAIST provides assurances, which we have sought but not received, that the Center will not develop autonomous weapons lacking meaningful human control.\n\nWe will, for example, not visit KAIST, host visitors from KAIST, or contribute to any research project involving KAIST.\n\nIf developed, autonomous weapons will be the third revolution in warfare. They will permit war to be fought faster and at a scale greater than ever before. They have the potential to be weapons of terror.\n\nDespots and terrorists could use them against innocent populations, removing any ethical restraints.\n\nThis Pandora's box will be hard to close if it is opened.\n\nAs with other technologies banned in the past like blinding lasers, we can simply decide not to develop them. We urge KAIST to follow this path, and work instead on uses of AI to improve and not harm human lives.\n\nA full list of signatories can be found here.", "Goodwood Estate, United Kingdom -- Flashy Mustangs grinding up a hill. Race car drivers signing autographs. Food tents serving up bacon sandwiches.\n\nThis is the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a four-day celebration of British motoring that could serve as a possible inspiration for transforming the North American International Auto Show.\n\nAs traditional auto shows from Detroit to Paris struggle to stay relevant, auto show organizers are looking to this annual event in West Sussex for ideas on creating their own citywide celebration of the automobile.\n\nThe Detroit Auto Dealers Association, organizer of the annual show at Cobo Center, dispatched floor manager Andrea Trudeau to Goodwood last weekend to scout out the festival.\n\n\"It's a celebration of cars as opposed to a display of cars,\" said Steven Armstrong, head of European operations for Ford Motor Co., which had a major presence at Goodwood this year. \"A lot of people come here to see the latest GT go up the hill, but while they're here (we get to) engage the next generation of buyers.\n\nMarking its 25th anniversary this year, the Goodwood Festival was set up like a music festival for cars: For four days, automakers brought out their fastest, loudest and most expensive vehicles to race up a hill on a mile-long track that bisected the festival grounds. Others fought for position around a rally track.\n\nSpread throughout the estate were food stands, vendor tents where companies showcased new technology, and towering stands erected by global automakers where attendees kicked the tires of new cars and took them on test drives.\n\nEngines roared. Cars churned dust from the lawn as they clipped corners approaching the hill-climb. Professional drivers did burn-outs or ripped doughnuts in front of the estate before rocketing up the hill.\n\nWith experiences like that, Goodwood attendance has grown steadily to more than 200,000, with millions more watching online. The expansion has come even as Detroit and other mainline shows lose manufacturers who no longer consider them \"must-attend\" events -- and as car buyers look to the Internet to research vehicles.\n\nThe downward trend for traditional auto shows is so unmistakable that Detroit planners have decided to move their 2020 event from January to June. It's part of an effort to reinvent the Detroit auto show after several global automakers -- including Germany's \"Big Three\" of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- decided to join the exodus from the January 2019 show. Their defections follow other carmakers who have skipped the past couple of shows.\n\nHeld every summer since 1993, the Festival of Speed on the grounds of the sprawling Goodwood Estate two hours south of London combines racing with a car show that brings together historic vehicles, concept cars, motorcycles and supercars that most drivers could only dream of owning. Automakers erect outdoor two- and three-story displays around the grounds.\n\nIt's a loud, fast event that attracts enthusiasts from around the world to eat, drink and cheer as famous drivers pilot cars up the hill and around the track.\n\n\"Goodwood has become the U.K. auto show,\" Stuart Dyble, a long-time auto industry public relations executive and CEO of London-based Influence Associates, said in an interview here with The Detroit News. Dyble headed Ford Motor Co.'s European product launches and auto shows in the late 1990s before becoming vice president of public relations for the Blue Oval's now-defunct Premier Automotive Group.\n\n\"There is absolutely no doubt that all the major auto shows are struggling,\" said Dyble, whose firm assisted nine brands at Goodwood this year, including Jaguar Land Rover, which built its Goodwood stand around a three-story tree. \"They're all in the process of reinventing themselves. Automotive enthusiasts and consumers can get every bit of information they want about a new car online.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Festival of Speed, originally inspired by the Indianapolis 500, is becoming a force in the global auto scene. It's become more important in the U.K. since the British International Motor Show died in 2008.\n\nFord, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, McLaren, Jaguar Land Rover and others last weekend used the event to showcase top-of-the-line cars most people could only dream of driving.\n\nThis year, Ford raced the eye-catching GT supercar, performed stunts with an F-150 and Ranger Raptors, and launched the 2019 special-edition 475-horsepower Mustang Bullitt on the hill-climb alongside the original Mustang fastback that Steve McQueen famously drove in a car-chase through San Francisco in the groundbreaking 1968 movie. At the 2018 Detroit auto show, those vehicles were largely stationary.\n\nLooking for inspiration\n\nThe Festival of Speed would be impossible to copy, say North American International Auto Show organizers and those running events for major automakers. But they say there's a template for auto show success here that could be adapted for a reimagined Detroit show.\n\nDetroit Auto Dealers Association spokesman Max Muncey told The Detroit News that while this was the first year his crew sent a representative to Goodwood, he and his team have kept tabs on the event through livestreams, media coverage and by talking with carmakers who've attended.\n\n\"The festival-like atmosphere (at Goodwood) with dynamic vehicle debuts are something that would play well for us in warmer months,\" Muncey said. \"What we look to deliver in 2020 and beyond will be unique to Detroit and showcase not only our great city, but the global automotive leadership this region holds.\"\n\nDetails on changes could come Tuesday when the Detroit show officially announces the date change from winter to summer.\n\nEd Laukes, group vice president for Toyota Motor North America, believes changes are needed. \"It would behoove all shows, including NAIAS, to look at all the new elements they feel are successful in attracting attendees and coverage. Festivals like (Goodwood) are a great example of success... some experiential elements would add value and shimmer to auto shows.\"\n\nAt its core, the Goodwood Festival of Speed is a celebration of cars, motorcycles and racing that offers consumers an \"experience,\" Ed Foster, deputy head of Goodwood's motorsport content, told The News in an interview. The Formula One speedsters, drift cars, luxury sport cars, supercars and muscle cars -- some piloted by famous race drivers -- launch from the starting line of the hill-climb track nearly every 30 seconds. All day long.\n\nAdd to that a historic estate hosting the festival, food stands pushing British fare like bacon-and-butter sandwiches, and appearances by some of the most storied vehicles in European racing history.\n\nGoodwood embraces its British identity, and that's part of what's clicking with attendees.\n\n\"You don't get any show that has absolutely everything,\" said Jack Burgoine, a 22-year-old who traveled to the show from Bedfordshire with his brother and father. \"It's definitely better when the car comes to life. There's more to do than just look at cars.\"\n\nEvery vehicle that races at Goodwood is parked in a paddock between runs for fans to come take a look. Drivers hang around for autographs. When cars fire up for a run, crowds flock to the sound.\n\nJulio Checchi, 14, and his father traveled from Argentina with their family for this year's festival. On the second floor of Ford's stand, father and son grinned as they rounded the corner to encounter the Bullitt Mustang.\n\nThe boy had just seen his favorite Lotus supercar race up the track. That alone meant Goodwood overshadowed any South American auto show he's attended.\n\n\"You get to see the cars in action,\" he said. \"I've seen the car before, but it was just sitting there. Here, I saw that just 10 minutes ago fly by on the track. It's amazing.\"\n\nDisplays stands often included live music or performances.\n\nFord had a ledge for visitors to jump about one-and-a-half stories onto a cushioned pad. Every hour, Ford had an acrobatics team put on a brief show using that same feature.\n\nLand Rover allowed people to drive SUVs on an off-road course. There's was a half-hour waiting line the entire weekend.\n\nChanging business model\n\nThat kind of active consumer traffic is resonating with automakers.\n\nThe presence of several brands, including Jaguar, Land Rover, Ford, BMW and Porsche has grown significantly in recent years. Automakers declined to comment on how much they spend at Goodwood compared to other auto shows.\n\nBut some companies that are pulling out of Detroit for 2019 -- namely Mercedes and BMW -- footed the bill to build multiple stands at Goodwood. Even Tesla, the Silicon Valley automaker that says auto shows are not part of its marketing plan, operated a stand here featuring all three of its cars, including the new Model 3.\n\nFord, meantime, juggles both old and new. Armstrong, Ford's head of European operations, said the company looks at Goodwood as a chance to show off performance vehicles in a more dynamic way.\n\n\"All of us are having to look at our business models\" for auto shows, Armstrong said. Auto shows and automakers, he said, need to figure out how to \"move with the times.\"\n\nCars take center stage\n\nGoodwood's growth in recent years is a product of authenticity, said Dyble, the London-based public relations executive. Organizers play to the history of British motorsports and British brands by bringing out storied vehicles for the hill climb. But they also nod to the future.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles raced up the hill throughout the weekend. Vendors set up stands on the sprawling lawn to showcase drones, autonomous technology and mobility-related ventures that have become front-and-center at the Detroit show. A man in a jet pack flew up and down a stretch of track each day.\n\nBut those were ancillary features. The main focus of the Festival of Speed seldom wavers from the cars -- and the history. Detroit, the birthplace of the modern automobile and the moving assembly line, could do something similar by drawing on its own unique history, Dyble believes.\n\n\"Detroit gives you a tremendous backdrop on which to draw,\" he said. \"People will buy into that. There's a real chance here, isn't there? Detroit needs to get back to leading again. This is where the auto show leads again.\"", "Photo: Getty\n\nElon Musk's long-simmering internet meltdown reached a full boil when he called a man who was mean to his submarine a pedophile. This gave the Tesla founder's harshest critics and fiercest fanboys something they could finally agree on: the guy needed to give it a rest and log off. A Twitter sabbatical, basically everyone concluded, was in his best interests. It is not, however, in ours. If anything, Musk should pour himself a frothy mug of genius juice, fire up the take machine, and tweet more -- a lot more.\n\nLet me explain. While the immediate stupefying effects of Musk's worst tweets are now obvious, over time they serve to illuminate an important, larger truth: The captains of industry we venerate for their perceived brilliance are often huge dumbasses when it comes to anything other than accumulating a lot of money and turning it into more. Time and time again, ignorance of this key fact has proved disastrous for the American people. Public acts of self-dick-stepping might be the only way to dispel the myth of the benevolent rich genius for good.\n\nFor Musk, the candid display of his entire arse led to a minor \"correction\" of Tesla stock, which dropped nearly three per cent on Monday. Other Silicon Valley figures have faced similar consequences for saying what they really think online. The strongest reactions to Reddit's standing policy of not policing hate speech, for instance, have stemmed from CEO Steve Huffman's half-baked, off-the-cuff explanations to other users on the site. Similarly, influential tech investor Marc Andreessen (whom we once called \"The Internet Icon You've Probably Never Heard Of\") made his biggest splash outside the business press with hot Twitter takes on subjects like whether opposing colonialism is good or dumb. In the end, the Facebook board member took a \"Twitter break\" in 2016 that lasted for months, and he's significantly cut back on tweeting since. We are all the poorer for it.\n\nAdmittedly, there are aspects of bad Elon Musk tweets that don't serve the public good. When they're directed at a single person, they can inspire harassment by his legions of Ricks and Mortys, and by embarrassing Musk, they can hurt legitimate causes he has thrown his weight behind. If Musk were just a random jabroni, I'd agree that he (like most people) should not post on the bad website. He is not, however, a random jabroni. He's a billionaire 20 times over, one the most powerful unelected individuals on Earth.\n\nIf Musk stopped tweeting tomorrow, that influence might wane slightly, but most of it would still be there, operating in the kind of secrecy that the whims of the super-rich traditionally have. And without the clarifying effect of repeated social media fiascos, it would be easy to mistake Musk for what his peers are often regarded as: chill people who must have all the answers or else how would they be so loaded.\n\nIn an ideal world, not only would Elon Musk tweet more, but so would other titans of Silicon Valley. Imagine a world where Jeff Bezos offers real talk about Amazon and labour rights at 3 a.m. One where Mark Zuckerberg gets messy on the timeline with a Facebook user who was dumb enough to share their data with him.\n\nMaybe you'd endorse some of those outbursts. Maybe you think Musk used the term \"pedo guy\" to mean \"man child or pedestrian,\" too. That's your right, I guess. But if so, wouldn't we better off with more remarkable insights like these from the big, rich smartypantses that otherwise silently shape our world?", "When I first visited Canary Wharf in the early 1990s, I was struck by a set of black-and-white posters in the shopping concourse advertising the Co-op Bank's ethical banking stance: essentially, no lending to arms, tobacco, gambling or oil companies, or to regimes that disrespected human rights. A cynic might have argued that it was all about virtue signalling (before we learned that phrase) in the sense that no landmine manufacturer or brutal Third World dictator had ever been known to pop into a Co-op branch, ask for a loan and be met with a polite refusal and a copy of the policy. But it was a smart exercise in market positioning that won many new customers at the time -- and a bold statement to buy poster sites beneath Canary Wharf's burgeoning towers of finance.\n\nIt was the work of Co-op Bank's then managing director Terry Thomas (later Lord Thomas of Macclesfield), who died this month. His and another death -- that of Tessa Tennant, a passionate advocate for socially responsible investment who launched the City's first 'green' unit trust in 1988 -- provide food for thought on the intersection of money and moral codes. The environmentalist Tom Burke, who was Tennant's first boss at the Green Alliance think tank, told me she was 'the wild child of the movement' in her early campaigning days but 30 years later the ideas she espoused have gone completely mainstream. No investment institution or pension fund is without its own ethical policy, and no shareholder-owned company operates without awareness of its wider impact on the planet.\n\nArguably again, there's an awful lot of PR spin and self-righteous verbiage in this sphere. And you might think the money world has actually become more amoral, not less, over that period because so much wealth has accrued in bad hands, offshore, held through uncaring nominees, untaxed and very often stolen in the first place from citizens of undemocratic regimes. But that makes it more important, not less, that sincere campaigners should keep trying to raise moral awareness. As Tom Burke says: 'If you want to change the way the world goes round, first you have to change the way the money goes round.'\n\nStrange times at Hammerson, the blue-chip property company whose 1.2 million square metres of retail space includes such cathedrals of consumerism as the Bullring in Birmingham, Brent Cross in north London and Bicester Village, the prime destination for every Chinese visitor who sets foot in Britain these days. But the breed of established retailers who are traditional anchor tenants of glossy shopping centres and retail parks are fast becoming an endangered species as the drift online continues, and Hammerson has begun to look like a company that's waiting for fate to determine its future because its own board no longer knows what to do next.\n\nIn April, under pressure from some of its own shareholders, Hammerson abandoned a proposed \u00a33.4 billion takeover of Intu, owner of Manchester's Trafford Centre. At the same time, a \u00a35 billion takeover approach from Kl\u00e9pierre, a French shopping centre group, was bluntly rejected -- leaving Kl\u00e9pierre's spokesman to regret that 'the board of Hammerson did not provide any meaningful engagement'. Then we read in Retail Gazette this month that the board had instead 'flown in management consultancy firm McKinsey & Co to help it understand global retail trends and launch a new strategy', a move which smacks to many observers of utter desperation.\n\nMeanwhile, Hammerson's shares, which dropped out of the FTSE 100 in March, trade at a permanent hefty discount to the value of its properties; and US 'vulture fund' Elliott Advisors has built up a 5 per cent stake, presumably with the intention of causing trouble. Heads may roll: if I was Hammerson chief executive David Atkins -- in post since 2009, paid almost \u00a32 million last year -- I'd be feeling distinctly nervous.\n\nElon Musk, the California-based entrepreneur behind the Tesla electric car, the SpaceX commercial rocket venture and several other wacky start-ups, made a fool of himself with his attempt to intervene in the Thai cave rescue and subsequent Twitter spat, but there's no doubt he's an original thinker and a remarkable businessman.\n\nIf the futuristic Tesla is a fine feat of technology, what's more impressive is that the company is not only still in business after 15 years without turning a profit and having lost at least $3.5 billion since 2015, but that its market capitalisation, at $52 billion, is bigger than Ford's at $42 billion. Tesla built more than 100,000 cars last year compared with 6.6 million by Ford worldwide.\n\nMy man in California with a close eye on the tech scene says the deal that really showed Musk's mettle was his purchase for Tesla in 2010 of the huge former General Motors-Toyota factory at Fremont. GM thought it was worth half a billion but Musk snapped it up, with government support, for just $42 million. 'So yes, he's probably an asshole,' says my man, 'but a brilliant one.'\n\nA postscript on Lord Carrington. When not in government in the 1970s he was a non-executive director of Barclays Bank -- seated at the board table next to my father, a grammar school boy who had risen from junior clerk and generally took a dim view of toffs. Impressed though he was by Carrington's grasp of business issues and sharp contributions to what passed for debate in the deferential boardroom milieu, my father could never get used to the Old Etonian peer's way of making jokes about all the most serious problems facing the bank in those dire economic days. I once asked Carrington for his own recollection of the same meetings: neatly illustrating the point, he said, 'Oh yes, I remember Vander Weyer, he was great fun, we used to laugh a lot.'", "GreenPower Motor Company, Inc.

Gentlemen you have the floor.\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nThank you, Colby. A very hearty welcome to fellow shareholders of Greenpower Motor. Thank you for joining us today. My name is Brendan Riley and I'm the President of Greenpower Motor and here in [indiscernible] about 90 degrees and we are definitely enjoying some of the summer weather in California. Recently I issued a President's letter to all of you discussing some of the topics that are very upfront and personal to Greenpower right now and really some of the important items that discuss our progress, our sales pipelines, our new relationship that is of our production facility and really -- excellent.\n\nSo I'd really like to start with recapping my President's letter. So this will be a short recap and then I'll be heading the phone over to Fraser to talk about our financials, but right now I wanted to tell you that the future is very exciting for Greenpower Motor. We have recently started a relationship or exclusive representation by Creative Bus Sales otherwise known as CBS, the largest bus dealer in the U.S. and they will represent the entire line to bring our products from coast to coast. Now that means that Greenpower now has over 200 people working to take orders and service vehicles and a sales staff of just under a 100 people so Creative Bus Sales which has 19 locations, brick and mortar locations that can store parts, store vehicle, provide service for and active hubs to disseminate information are now at our disposal and will shortly here be making orders for Greenpower Bus. The relationships for dealers is very important and critical and we really feel that we found an excellent partner. There is not a manufacturer of cutaways, shuttle buses or school buses that is not utilizing the dealership model and again Greenpower is an alternative fuel technology company. We only make battery electric buses but still we make buses we need to deliver them in the customer's hands, they need to be serviced and maintained and they need the support that typically comes from dealerships. Our customers are used to interfacing with their providers and buses.\n\nSo we're very excited and pleased it's a three year agreement and along with that agreement comes with an order immediate order for 15 buses that's 10 of the school buses and five of our EV Stars, our newest product, our micro bus. Now to add to that good news California state which Fraser and I are located right now has a group called California Energy Commission, a public entity that has put forward $78.7 million into replacing old diesel school buses with zero emission school bus. Now there are only a few manufacturers of these buses Greenpower happens to be one of them. We really expect and hope to get a portion, decent sized portion of that and all of these orders are going to be placed not in a typical one to two year selling cycle but before the end of September for these vehicles. So its exciting and we'll be able to gauge our performance on this very quickly. $60,000 is available on top of the money that they're paying for the bus they are giving people free buses, $60,000 is available just for the vehicle infrastructure alone that's charger and charger installation. Now the biggest issue that most people have is when they go to buy a battery electric bus is not really buying the chargers, chargers are not the most expensive components, it's getting the power to the charger and this grant took that into consideration, it's the first of its type that I know of that really addresses that per unit cost and is very aggressive and [indiscernible] on a very realistic part of it. So it's a very, very important component of this compelling program.\n\nCEC also provide work force training and development resources at no charge in the schools and every school, public school and Office of Education is eligible for this program. On our transit side of things Greenpower has now delivered two buses to Porterville which have been accepted and paid for and has delivered an invoice to three additional buses that are getting upgraded and incorporated into the fleet as we speak. So by the end of this month we expect to see five buses parked over Porterville transit that Greenpower supplied and this is very important in that of the 10 buses we got orders for we've already managed to deliver and invoice for five of them so we're about through half of our commitment to Porterville transit and we are performing on our end. The buses are delivered on time and they've already been approved for use in California by the CHP, already been certified, another important hurdle in bus delivery.\n\nSpeaking of Porterville, our production facility is moving the facility that we're building from scratch has been all the plans and permits have been approved by the City of Porterville and that facility is coming together. The problem is it's not coming together fast enough for us Greenpower and we've decided to find a temporary facility to begin production hardcore full production of these vehicles in Porterville, so Fraser has been working with several property owners and very shortly we should be able to announce that we have a facility under contract where we can start building buses from ground up either complete knockdown or semi-knockdown assembly of these vehicles as soon as September or October of this year. So that's very exciting we are able then to deliver buses that will meet the Buy America requirements that transit properties require if they're using federal funds.\n\nNow in Canada, we've delivered two of our EV 5 50 double deckers to CVS Tours and we have commitments for seven more of those units be delivered by 2020 to that customer. These 100 passenger buses will continue to take passengers from the cruise ship terminal in Victoria through the Butchart Gardens, and other tourist attraction the beautiful city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. We do expect even more presence on Vancouver Island as we bring new products to Canada. The Port of Oakland will be receiving their first EV Star, actually our first delivery next month and that's a very small, well small for us 25 foot long micro bus all battery electric for their shuttle that's going to be used on the campus and terminal of the Port of Oakland. We're also expecting two more buses to be delivered in September we've already got the order and the contract for those to UCSF that's the University of California San Francisco and that's for two shuttle buses to be used in downtown San Francisco again to shuttle San Francisco, UCSF students to and from their classes and various campuses.\n\nNow in the article that was recently published by Forbes they were talking about very important data like price of batteries coming down the fact that automotive accessory manufacturers and automotive component manufacturers, tier one suppliers, tier two suppliers, tier three suppliers were expecting a great portion of their businesses to be at least 30% for electric vehicles again this is by 2030. Now that's important that they're expecting to have that level of sales but if we can add to that that battery prices are coming down between 15% to 20% year over year, battery performance and energy density is increasing by 15% to 20% year over year giving us a net effect of 25% to 35% battery improvement at the blended cost and energy density year-over-year. What that means for us in our industry and for Greenpower specifically is that battery electric buses will be the dominant technology. We expect the dominant technology sold in the U.S. by 2025, the buses will be able to go as far as their diesel counterparts and they will cost the same to buy as a diesel counterpart producing zero emissions and having a less cost of ownership right away and to the life of it.\n\nNow I am extremely excited to recap some of this great news and I'm looking very looking very forward to hearing your questions and comments. If there is anything that you folks would like to know more about what I've discussed or even other issues that pertain to Greenpower Motor's I'm very interested in hearing about it. This is Brendan Riley and I'm passing the call over to Fraser Atkinson, Chairman of the Board for Greenpower Motor's. Thank you.\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nThank, Brendan. Good afternoon everyone. I'm just down from Porterville where the last few days the temperature was well over 100 degrees so actually I'm enjoying lower temperatures in Los Angeles here today. I would like to thank our fellow shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders as literally no pun intended it's been a ride from Greenpower's inception eight years ago to where we posted our first quarterly results so we're profitable. My discussion today also includes those of our CFO, Mark Achtemichuk who is on the call and available for questions when we reach the Q&A.\n\nFirst let's discuss the fourth quarter results and I should note that all the amounts are in U.S. dollars. For the fourth quarter Greenpower revenues of 3.435990 million, cost of sales of 2.2 million generating a gross profit of 1.168225 million or 34% of revenues. The revenue was derived from the sale of four buses, two EV, 350 40 foot low floor transit buses and 2 EV 550 double decker buses. These are Greenpower's two largest vehicles and as such have higher margins on our corporate average. Expenses amounted to little over 1.1 million and including noncash items over $400,000 which after a tax recovery and other items resulted in net income of $655,059 or $0.01 a share. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter amounted to $466,707 or 13.6% of revenues.\n\nNext we would like to discuss the production during the year ended March 31, 2018. Greenpower completed the Synapse 72 school bus which started demonstration tours in the summer of 2017. The company completed and sold its second EV 550 all electric double decker bus for operations in Victoria Canada as Brendan referred to earlier. Greenpower started production on 10 of our EV 350 40 foot low floor transit buses for Porterville with an additional bus as a spare and for demonstration purposes. Two of these were completed and delivered in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year and production had started on the remaining EV 350s and were in various stages of production at March 31, 2018. Greenpower received orders and started production on six Synapse 72 school buses as of March 31, 2018 the rolling chassis had been substantially completed for the first three and we had started production on the remaining three. Greenpower also completed the design and started production on 10 of its EV Star mini buses.\n\nSo to recap at the year end of March 31, 2018 the company was at various stages of productions with eight of our EV 350 vehicles, six Synapse 72 school buses and 10 EV Star mini buses, a total of 24 buses in various stages of production. Other highlights of the year include as a result of the demonstrations of the Synapse 72 all electric school bus we obtained orders with a number of school districts including L.A. Unified, the largest school district in the State of California. We opened a sales office in Los Angeles in January 2018 and hired a seasoned industry veteran to head sales and marketing. We established a facility for a final assembly in Porterville, company as Brendan referenced submitted plans and obtained the grading permit for the civil work which needs to be completed prior to the construction of 144,000 square foot manufacturing facility. At the year end the company had over a $1 million of cash in the bank in positive working capital of 2.2 million. Subsequent to the year-end as noted by Brendan Greenpower entered into a three year exclusive factory representative agreement with creative process bus sales, the U.S's largest bus dealer for sales parts and service, companies secured orders for the EV Stars from the Port of Oakland and UC San Francisco the second largest employer in the City of San Francisco and finally the company arranged a line of credit for $2 million from Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's largest chartered banks. As noted earlier in the call the company had 24 buses in various stages of production at March 31, 2018. The source of capital are funds for the production of these buses that was either from private placements of the company's done up to last fall or non-dilutive loans from directors of the company or more recently from the recepts for the delivery of buses pursuant to sales orders. In many cases the company has had to prepay for components or parts which is required significant funding to cover working capital requirements.\n\nWhat the line of credit with Bank of Montreal provides Greenpower is the credibility of a senior lender allows our management team to engage a suppliers for more traditional payment terms which will help realign our working capital requirements. Obtaining the facility also allows BMO Bank of Montreal to learn about our business first hand such that as our order book grows we can seek to increases this facility in order to fund our growth and by way of example a traditional diesel bus manufacturer recently increased their facility with the senior lender that had started at under a $1 million about three years ago to where they've increased it to $20 million. So that gives you a scope in terms of what our view or vision is in terms of this facility.\n\nAnd at this time I'd like to turn it back to Brendan Riley to talk a little bit more about the product and future with our product groups.\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nThank you, Fraser. Thank you for that exciting news. Hello again this is Brendan Riley, President of Greenpower Motor's. I wanted to do a little bit of a deep dive into several products and the future of these several products for Greenpower. Now we can talk about our past performance but I'd really like to tell you folks now really about what we have on the very near and close horizon. One of the products that you've heard about is the Synapse school bus line of Greenpower. The Synapse is one of the most compelling new products in the EV space, it starts as all Greenpower products with a clean sheet design and it's the first entirely newly designed school bus that's hit the market for the past 30 years. We do not use -- Greenpower does not use existing truck technology in other words old fashioned truck chassis to build their buses and then stuff batteries in the whatever space they can claim. We start out with battery and the traction motor and build the bus around so we actually have a structure those around me higher perimeter of the bus provides an envelope for safe and proper layout of the batteries and drive trains. It also gives us a very compelling story for the passengers experience, it's quiet, comfortable and above all it's safe.\n\nSo Greenpower has three of the synapse products available. We've got a accessible version which is shorter 32 feet that can hold up to eight wheelchair position plus an additional 20 students on board or any variation of the above and that's for special needs students that may have some challenges when it comes to moving around walking and alike. The other bus we have that you know about is a Synapse 72 that's 36.5 foot long, 72 passenger vehicle and then we have the newest version and then that's the Synapse 90, that vehicle is 40 feet long and seats 90 passengers. This is very important that we have this 90 passenger vehicle because that's the highest seating density, the highest passenger count student count school bus on the market today and it will help in places where they have high population density of students, bring them to schools not only in a zero emission fashion but the greatest number of them in the zero emission fashion.\n\nNow in California alone it's just a California market I just told you that we had $78.7 million by the CEC available for funding of these buses, that's actually half of it. That money has to be, will be, is coupled with California Air Resources Board or CARBs money hold [indiscernible] which will add an additional $220,000 per school bus at a minimum and there we have over $120 million available for this program. So together we have a blend of over $200 million available for school buses and those orders aren't just happening again two years into the future when people get around to buying these buses, these orders are going to be placed -- have to be placed by the end of September. So it's very exciting, it's very near term business that we've got for one of the most compelling product on the market. And again these school buses will not only be sold in California they will be sold all over the country, in Canada and beyond but if we just focus on California alone and it's just amazing, amazing feet.\n\nThe other product I'd like to really do a deep dive into is our EV Star. I know we've talked about this product, it's a very compelling micro bus the first purpose built micro bus battery electric micro bus sold in the U.S. again this vehicle is on the HVIP, which means that CARB is paying down at minimum $90,000 per unit which is over half of the vehicle price itself but what this does is this allows this vehicle to go into places where regular internal combustion diesel cutaways, CNG cutaways have been sold and that product hasn't even been touched by any of us in the EV space. So now Greenpower has a product that can actually go into the transit property, shuttle bus properties, airports, student transportation you name it we get into it with this product, it really opens a lot of doors and makes a very compelling argument for replacing internal combustion vehicles when Greenpower, battery electric technology. Now two of these customers, one UCSF, the other Port of Oakland are going to be running these buses from very high profile service but what we haven't touched on yet is a new concept in public transit that this vehicle is ideally suited for and that's called micro trams and what micro transit is and say it's a concept that's in response to the shared mobility, uber-less of the world where they're actually able to do a better job responding to the first mile and last mile most transit operation and transit properties have been losing ridership over the years and it's gotten to the point where they're looking for a solution to get back some of these customers and they believe have gone over to these shared mobility platforms for their transportation needs.\n\nWe will get into more details later hopefully there will be a question on the EV Star I don't want to take too much of your time this valuable time in discussing these things and maybe if you got some pointed questions you can refer them but I'd like to tell you that we have some amazing products that are really ready to be deployed and are being deployed in the market place. These products will be the leaders in their sector and I believe that Greenpower by this time next year will have a combination of orders in deployment of over 200 buses.\n\nI'm going to pass this line back to Fraser. Sorry, I'm going back to Colby. Thank you again.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you very much gentlemen. This concludes the formal presentation and at this time we will begin the question and answer period. As stated before in order to best facilitate the Q&A I would request that any caller wishing to ask a question to please email me at info@greenpowerbus.com. I'll say again that info@greenpowerbus.com with the subject line question or shareholder call. In the body of the email you need only have your name and your company or an indication that you're a private investor if you prefer. Questions will be answered in the order that they are received. If a caller wishes to ask another question after their's has been answered and after we have moved to another caller's question I would request that they send second email so that callers are not competing over the line. Now before beginning to speak please press star, 69 to unmute your call.\n\nOur first questions come from Jacob Dawson and Alex [indiscernible] from Hybrid Financial. Gentlemen if you could please press star 69 before beginning your question and go ahead.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nQ - Unidentified Analyst\n\nI was just looking into the sector, I was wondering what are some of the advantages that Greenpower's product line has over some competitors, New Flyer, Grande West and why should you know various purchasers be looking at a GPV products over the competitors.\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nThis is Brendan Reilly and thank you so much for asking that question that's a very important question. The competitive advantages of Greenpower products are first and foremost that we are the only company out there that has a complete zero emission offering all of our vehicles are zero emission and all of our vehicles are built from ground up zero emissions. So we are a battery electric bus company that only makes battery electric buses and no other types of buses. Our vehicles are equipped with a very critical and important safety components and systems including the ability control, ABS and anti-skid restraint or ASR, these programs, software and hardware modifications to vehicles allow our vehicles to handle and perform more safely than your conventional or typical bus. Our buses are the only buses that incorporate completely integrated telematics, hello? Telematics, monocoque chassis for large buses all the way down to our school bus and air ride suspense front and back if you look at all of our competitors in the high floor space they all have [indiscernible] spring, coil springs in the front, possibly air ride as options in the back. We provide full air ride suspensions to all our vehicles down to the Synapse shuttle which gives safe, smooth handling, great performance and also help keep safe and sound all of the electronics that are on board these vehicle. So our vehicles are designed for comfort and they're designed for safety.\n\nOur last point that really gives us a leg up is our durability, Greenpower uses best of breed components that have a huge track record, enormous track record, our Siemens electric drive have over a billion miles on them, our TM4 traction movers those have millions of miles on and all of the other components that we use are best of breed components that have the warranty backed up by major OEMs are available for spares in a timely fashion and you have the security of knowing that they've been vetted and proven in the industry.\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nActually one thing to add Jacob is that very high level, we are the only EV bus manufacturer heavy duty EV bus manufacturer in North America that truly does have the full suite of products you know where it's from a 25 or 7.5 meter mini bus upto a 45 foot double decker bus and everything in between covering school buses, shuttle buses and little for transit buses.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nRight. I think diversity is important. Another quick question is I've on the line, you guys mentioned the micro transit market earlier and maybe EV Star fits in that, I was wondering if you could maybe expand on just some of applications like what does micro transit mean I think you said it mentioned ride sharing, does it fit in with like a model like Uber somehow or something like that?\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nYes so what micro transit is again, thanks again that's a great question. This Brendan Riley responding. Micro transit is the transit industry response to use the overwhelming popularity that's actually eroding transit ridership and transit space that Uber and Lyft and some of the shared mobility, shared use really disruptive technologies have brought to the world and what micro transit does is it provides a system that's integrated with all forms of high technology GPS location. We've got cloud access, we've got connectivity to customers, all these things that are required that the Lyft's and the Uber's already do in this world those are already incorporated in the Greenpower as a vehicle and these technologies and others allow us to seamlessly integrate into this concept a micro transit where they don't have to add this stuff on to the vehicle and figure out how to engineer the end of the vehicle, Greenpower is bringing the vehicle to market with this technology already engineered into it. So our vehicles can be used again in micro transit which is -- transit has always been another issue you hear is kind of again I say this in kind of a jokingly way transit was of a service that brought you from where you don't live to where you don't work it also is a way of referring to the first mile last mile of transits that especially older people and people that don't have the mobility they have trouble with and Ube really was an answer to that or Lyft was an answer to that.\n\nNow transit properties have regular transit and then they've got this paratransit, dial a ride type service, those services, the dial a ride service is just being surplanted completely by these Lyfts and these Ubers so the transit properties are trying to find something in between a paratransit and a Uber service that they themselves can operate, that requires a smaller vehicle that has maybe up to 19 passengers that can navigate small streets, load people fairly quickly and disload them - embark them and disembark them quickly and really have a vehicle that doesn't often require the airbrake endorsement, the other licenses that are required to operate these expensive large buses to operate more like vans and our EV Star although it's a mini bus it has a lot of these features and is ideal again not only doing this but doing this with a zero emission footprint. Quiet again in the city streets and creating no form of any pollution. So again the transit properties are trying micro transit, I personally believe it's a very important piece of the puzzle but public transit in the U.S. and Canada and it's all the buzz in the transit world and once we see some of these deployments and how successful they are I think that it's not only a great market for Greenpower's product but it's just a great solution for the transit riding public.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay, so if I can read between the lines, you're saying there is some natural synergies built into products like the EV Star and where this micro transit market is headed?\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nI couldn't have said more elegantly myself.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you, Jacob. Just for those joining us this is the Q&A portion of the Greenpower 2018 Q4 conference call. I will just repeat the instructions. I would request that any caller wishing to ask a question to please email me at info@greenpowerbus.com with a subject line question or shareholder. In the body of the email you need only have your name and your company or an indication that you are a private investor if you prefer.\n\nMoving forward we have received a question from a private investor who asks what has allowed Greenpower to expand its product lines to so many numerous vehicles?\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nWell this is Brendan Riley responding. The main thing is the talent that Greenpower has. We've got amazing resources internally and we've got engineers, designers and visionaries that are able to really not only design these vehicles but help execute them also. Using our clean sheet design and our approach to building these vehicles it's really allowed the expansion of our product line very quickly similar to what Tesla has been able to do with their clean sheet design and their expansion of their product line starting out with one model now having four or five model depending on how you look at it. Same kind of process the Greenpower has employed. Again clean sheet of paper, batteries, motor and then you build a vehicle around that.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you, Brendan. We have another question from in a private investor who would prefer to remain anonymous. This person asks with regards to VW funds when do we expect to see those begin to roll out and how has Greenpower prepared itself to best take advantage of those available funds?\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nWell this is Fraser Atkinson and we've recently issued press release that just captured the initial plans and rolls out of 10 of the 50 states just as a quick summary for the benefit of those that aren't fully familiar with this. There's 2.9 billion that has been allocated to various states as well as the Native American Indian tribes and within that allocation each state has to decide which mitigation actions are going to achieve choose and how they're going to allocate those funds within those mitigation actions. There's a few states that has decided that they're going to go 100% of an allocation to category two which is effectively the purchase of all electric transit school or shuttle buses, it also has a few other categories but that is the only one that has a 100% funding availability with the VW money and whereas others have a mix of mitigation actions but what we have found with the first 10 states that we summarized is that there is by and large a significant skewing to the benefit of all electric buses whether it's transit or school in particular with a heavy focus on school busses. In talking to some of these states what they have indicated is that it has one of the broadest reaches in terms of educating the public about electrification of fleets and in doing so within a shuttle or a private operator there isn't perhaps nearly the same outreach as having an electrification strategy around school buses. So we see and the $400 million that we summarized in our press release related to just what the announcements that have come out over the last 90 days and we certainly see the other states coming on board over this summer and into the early fall where they are starting the initial receipt of proposals and the deployment and utilization of those funds as early as this fall and winter. So huge impetus to the industry in terms of the availability of funds for the electrification of buses.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you, Fraser. We have another question coming from John Stokes, Haywood Securities [ph]. John if you could please plus star 69 before beginning your question then you have the floor.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nI was just wondering what is the current cost of per kilowatt hour in your battery packs and how that compares with last year and how you kind of see that trending down going forward?\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nThis is Brendan Riley calling. John right now we're not sharing our cost per kilowatt hour for the battery packs, its not totally proprietary but bordering on proprietary. We do talk about our final cost of the vehicles and then we also referred to as I refer to it as the decrease in overall cost year-over-year or large lot procurement of our large lot procurement and we have noticed a 15% to 20% drop in price so if I was paying $1 per kilowatt hour a year ago this year I'm paying between $0.85 and $0.80 per kilowatt hour for that same pack. I wish I could be more specific but again this is one of the things that a lot of us bus manufacturers keep to ourselves mostly because it is kind of a competitive not secret information but one of the things that allows us to competition, but yes thanks for asking the question and that is a very good question.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nAll right we have another question again from someone who would prefer -- a private investor who would prefer to remain anonymous. Fraser, this is someone you've spoken to with regard to the Bloomberg projections for EV bus sales, new bus sales. Could you please speak to that and speak to when you think that's EV bus sales will overtake alternative or diesel bus sales in North America?\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nThanks, Colby. Yes the Bloomberg which issued a report a little over a month ago a very detailed report had a number of interesting revelations at a very high level what they proposed was that they felt that by the year 2030 that the electrification of the bus industry would be the highest level of adoption in North America put it in context their prediction in 2030 is that for new sales that year they were predicting 84% of them would be new electric buses, electric powered buses and as a comparison they were predicting that the automotive industry would still be less than 30% so lot of discussion in the media and other forms of communications out there where people talk a lot about the various automotive manufacturers that are moving towards electrification and the presumption that we'll be moving very quickly to electrification within the automotive industry but it's interesting to see a company like Bloomberg that does very detailed research to make that prediction.\n\nNow from that prediction is that if you take where we are right now which is if -- in any sort of drive or curve is very much towards zero in terms of the electrification of the heavy duty buses in the United States, in Canada is that if you say okay where is it going to cross the line and that prediction has the number of new electric buses equating to the number of all other types of boxes some around 2025, 2026. Furthermore if you look at around 60,000 new heavy duty buses being sold in North America every year and that would be school buses, transit buses, over the road motor coaches, is double-deckers and everything else if the number today is 60,000 is that Bloomberg prediction looking at the curve has us at 10,000 electric buses per year between 2021, 2022 and that's not that far away and I know the discussion I've had with a few people on this report is that for many of the organizations that are now starting to get engaged or looking electrification they realize that there's this significant uptake or uptick that's going to occur and they're looking at moving you know moving forward with their plans as far as either testing or implementing electrification strategy within their property sooner than later.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you, Fraser.\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nThere is no other question?\n\nColby Richardson\n\nYes that's right. There are no further questions currently available. So I will pass it over to you and Brendan for closing remarks.\n\nFraser Atkinson\n\nWell given that we're coming up to the hour my quick comment is that we're very excited at Greenpower in terms of you know all the hard work that the team has done to bring our company to where we are, has positioned us in a number of different areas either with products that truly don't have any competition to where to other sectors where we have a great product to compete with just a handful of other competitors. So very excited about the next year to 18 months for our company and we appreciate all the support that we've received from shareholders, customers and our employees.\n\nBrendan Riley\n\nThis is Brendan. I'd like to thank you again for being investors in Greenpower and putting your faith and trust in us as shepherds of your very hard earned money. We are doing our very best. We'll continue to do our very best and make sure you're rewarded for your faith. Thank you again.\n\nColby Richardson\n\nThank you both and thank you everyone for attending this call. A transcript of the call will be available on our website later. Thank you everyone.", "An automotive consultant who has been critical of the fit and finish of Tesla's Model 3 is now praising the EV maker's sedan as a \"symphony of engineering\" and the most profitable electric vehicle on the market.\n\nSandy Munro, the president of Michigan-based automotive consultant Munro & Associates, finished the teardown and analysis of the Tesla Model 3, and came away impressed.\n\nAt first, \"I thought this was one of the worst fit and finishes I've seen in decades,\" Munro told the Autoline television show this week.\n\nAfter Munro and his team tore down the Model 3, the early critic now said that the electronics at Tesla are a \"symphony of engineering\" and that \"they did a really good systems integration job.\"\n\nIn April, Munro was praising the battery pack of Model 3, but lamented the poor fit and finish and believed that the vehicle was costly and heavy to build.\n\nNow, after the total teardown, Munro thinks that the electronics \"density is out of this world, the layouts are wonderful.\"\n\n\"This is like a symphony of engineering,\" Munro told the Autoline show.\n\nAsked about the big takeaway conclusion from the teardown of the Model 3, Munro said:\n\n\"The Model 3 is profitable, so I have to eat crow. I didn't think it was going to happen this way, but the Model 3 is profitable.\"\n\nRelated: Who Actually Benefits From Sanctions On Iran?\n\nTesla is banking on Model 3 production ramp-up and sales to turn in its first ever profit, while may analysts continue to doubt that the EV maker can become profitable as it burns a lot of cash in the process.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla said that it had actually reached the 5,000-a-week Model 3 production goal that many Wall Street analysts had doubted it would. Tesla said that it had reached its 5,000-per-week Model 3 production rate by the end of June. In the last seven days of the second quarter, Tesla produced 5,031 Model 3s and 1,913 Model S and X vehicles. The EV maker also expects to increase its Model 3 production rate to 6,000 Model 3s per week by late August.", "Bangkok (AP) -- Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has apologized for calling a British diver involved in the Thailand cave rescue a pedophile, saying he spoke in anger but was wrong to do so.\n\nThere was no immediate public reaction from diver Vern Unsworth to Musk's latest tweets.\n\nMusk's initial tweet calling Unsworth a \"pedo\" was a response to a TV interview Unsworth gave. In it, he said Musk and SpaceX engineers orchestrated a \"PR stunt\" by sending a small submarine to help divers rescue the 12 Thai soccer players and their coach from a flooded cave. Unsworth said the submarine, which wasn't used, wouldn't have worked anyway.\n\n\"My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths ...\" Musk tweeted.\n\n\"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nMusk's Sunday tweet, later deleted, had sent investors away from Tesla stock, which fell nearly 3 percent Monday but recovered 4.1 percent on Tuesday.

In a series of bouts, the two Teslas established themselves as the cars to beat on the strip, with the P85D even teaching a heavily-tuned Honda Civic a hard lesson in acceleration after the latter opted to assault the ears of surrounding people by intentionally backfiring.\n\nThe two Tesla Model S' day at the track was uploaded by YouTube racing channel Lars Mars Cars. As could be seen in the video, the two full-sized electric family sedans, including the older P85D, showed that when it comes to acceleration, it takes a monstrous amount of upgrades to give the Teslas some competition.\n\nMost notable in the video was a bout between the Tesla Model S P85D and a heavily-modified 550 hp turbo Honda Civic with a full drag racing setup. During the seconds leading up to the race, the driver of the Japanese-made tuner decided to rev his engine hard, causing extremely loud noises from its exhaust and assaulting the ears of one of the drag strip's staff.\n\nAs soon as the race began, the tuned Civic accelerated, popping even more as it shot forward. By this time, however, the Model S P85D was already ahead. Thanks to the P85D's twin electric motors that produce instant torque, the all-electric family sedan was able to establish an early lead against the tuner.\n\nApart from the heavily tuned Civic, the Model S P85D also battled a series of opponents, including a Supercharged Ford Mustang 4.6k, a Ford Mustang GT, and a 1000+ hp Nissan GT-R. Among its opponents, the P85D only fell to the insanely tuned GT-R with more than 1000 hp. As for the Tesla Model S P100D, the all-electric family sedan also performed well, beating a Nissan GT-R with more than 500+ hp. The P100D also had a notably late launch against an Audi RS6 C7 wagon, but it appeared to have caught up to the German high-performance car as the race went on. Just like its older sibling, the P100D was only beaten by the 1000+ hp Nissan GT-R.\n\nOverall, the Model S P85D, despite being older than the P100D, proved that it was still a formidable force on the drag strip. The P85D, after all, is Tesla's first all-wheel drive Model S that made headlines for being a full-sized family sedan with a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 seconds. Tesla eventually made the vehicle even faster through its \"Ludicrous\" upgrade, catapulting the vehicle to elite performance status and become the winner of Motor Trend's \"World's Greatest Drag Race.\"\n\nWatch the Tesla Model S duo race several high-performance ICE vehicles in the video below.\n\nTesla Model S teaches eardrum-assaulting turbo Honda Civic a hard lesson\n\nInterested in solar?

Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nThe tweet was later deleted.\n\nMusk said in his tweet on Wednesday that his words were \"spoken in anger after Mr Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader.\"\n\nThe boys, aged between 11 and 16, were discharged from a hospital in Chiang Rai yesterday and held a news conference in the evening.", "The Rimac Concept Two: boasting 1,914 horsepower to propel the 0-60 mph in 1.85 seconds, it has a maximum speed to 412 kilometres per hour.\n\nWhile Tesla is stealing much of the innovative limelight in the motoring world, one company that is busy trying to win over petrolheads to the electric car revolution is Rimac Automobili, a little-known Croatian electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer in which Porsche has just taken a minority stake.\n\nEstablished by Mate Rimac, the company has developed the one of world's fastest electric supercars with its latest vehicle, the Rimac Concept Two, boasting 1,914 horsepower to propel the 0-100 km/h in 1.85 seconds, and a maximum speed to 412 km/h.\n\nAlmost every component used in the company's supercars are designed and built from scratch in-house, which partly explains the $2 million starter price for the car.\n\nThe vehicle, which can be unlocked and started using facial recognition technology, comes with Level 4 autonomous capabilities and claims an impressive 400-mile range on a single charge via a 120 kWh battery. It is expected to go into production in 2020 with Rimac looking to manufacture at least 150 of them a year.\n\nWhile the supercars themselves have become objects of desire and helped to change the way people think about EVs, Rimac's other role as a high-end component and technology provider for other companies, including large OEMs, means its parts are turning up elsewhere.\n\nRemember the Jaguar E-Type Zero that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle drove off in after their recent wedding reception? The \u00a3350,000 car, which was originally manufactured in 1968, was converted from a combustion engine into an environmentally friendly electric one by Rimac.\n\nIf you haven't heard of the company from that then maybe they popped up on your radar when footage emerged of presenter Richard Hammond walking away from the burning wreckage of a Rimac Concept One car while shooting the television show The Grand Tour last year. While the jury is still out on whether it was the car or Hammond's driving that led to the crash, the accident certainly didn't hurt Rimac. It recorded an increase in orders as the public heard about the company for the first time.\n\nRimac, which has signed deals to provide components and technology to car manufacturers that include Aston Martin, Jaguar and Koenigsegg, has raised over $30 million to date with Porche the latest investor to come onboard when it took a 10 per cent stake in the company last month. Other major backers include Asia's largest battery manufacturer, Camel Group.\n\nMate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 and remains its majority shareholder, says that while the group has made great progress to date, there is still much for it to achieve.\n\n\"The odds of getting to where we are now were next to nothing and the stars still have to align correctly for us to get where we want to be,\" he told The Irish Times recently.\n\nOne thing the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year award finalist has on his side is time. The Croat, who recently appeared on Forbes prestigious 30 Under 30 list of the top disruptors to watch, turned 30 this month. He said his interest in cars began young.\n\n\"I was always crazy about them. Even before I could walk or talk I was obsessed and that has never left me.\"\n\nAided to a love of cars was an early interest in electronics with the young man winning national awards in the subject while still at school. By the age of 17, Rimac also had a number of patents to his name. But it was two years later when the engine on his 1984 BMW 3 Series blew up that his obsession with cars and electrics merged.\n\nHe fitted the banjaxed BMW with an experimental electric vehicle drivetrain, turning it from a traditional combustion engine to electrical power. He then started racing the car against gas-powered ones.\n\n\"I wanted to prove that electric cars could be exciting rather than just boring and efficient. Of course, people laughed at me initially at the racetrack. There were plenty of wisecracks about having a washing machine on wheels and so on. At the beginning the car wasn't fast or reliable and I'd sometimes get electrocuted while driving it, but over time as we worked on it the car got better,\" said Rimac.\n\nSo much better that the re-engineered vehicle broke five F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) records and earned a Guinness World Record for fastest accelerating vehicle.\n\nIn 2009, Rimac decided to build his own electric car from scratch. What began as a garage project has rapidly grown into a 400-people company based in Sveta Nedelja, near Zagreb. There is also a subsidiary called Greyp Bikes which is developing high-performance electric bicycles that offer 65 km/h top speed and a range of up to 120 km without pedalling.\n\nRimac gained investors early on with the royal family of Abu Dhabi among those who wanted to back the company. However, they pulled out when he wouldn't relocate the company to the Middle East. Ultimately this was a good thing, according to the businessman.\n\n\"It would have been impossible to design cars in the way we have done if we hadn't have had constraints. These constraints helped turn us into a technology company, rather than just a manufacturer,\" he says.\n\n\"If we would have had a lot of finance then we would have just done what everyone else was doing, which is relying on suppliers for parts. But we had to be creative and develop a car from scratch instead. The great thing though about doing this with electric vehicles rather than gas-powered ones is that you can do things you'd never usually be able to do, even it in terms of things like fitting the battery and powertrain differently.\"\n\nHe continues. \" I really don't know of many examples in history where absolutely everything has been developed for one single purpose, which in our case is to design the perfect EV. If you look at other top-of-the-range cars like the LaFerarri for instance. Ferrari has taken the suspension from a 458, while the engine is carried over from an 812, and the gearbox comes from somewhere else again.\n\n\"There was no carryover for us when we designed the Concept car. Absolutely everything, from cooling pumps for batteries, to the chassis, the electrics and suspension were developed specially for it and so is optimised.\"\n\nThe company might not be as well known for its its role as a components manufacturer and technology provider but this part of the business, which grew out of its work designing parts for its own vehicles, helped it become commercially sustainable.\n\n\"Out of necessity we started to work with industry to engineer prototypes for them and this turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to us,\" said Rimac.\n\nAs Tesla has found out, it is one thing to build a prototype and another altogether to ramp up to full production. Rimac says that doing this is the biggest challenge currently facing the company.\n\nAnother big one is trying to build a sustainable business in Croatia. The country may have become known of late for his football team, which got to the World Cup final, but it is hardly the first place you'd think of when it comes to leading car manufacturers,\n\nRimac though is determined that the heart of the business will remain in his home country no matter how big the company grows.\n\n\"We are now employing 400 people and are planning new production facilities in Croatia with the goal of ultimately employing 2,000 people. I have been driven by patriotism for my country and maybe it would be better for the company if this were not so but I want a substantial part of the business to be there,\" he says.\n\n\"The company has a long way to go but I believe we will be known as the ones who make the best electric sports cars in the world and also as the leader provider of technology and parts for premium high performance vehicles made by others,\" Rimac added.", "Musk said his 'words were spoken in anger' and said sorry to Mr Unsworth and 'the companies I represent as leader'\n\nElon Musk has apologised to a British expat who helped with the rescue of 12 schoolboys trapped in a cave in Thailand after calling him 'pedo guy'.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur, who is chief executive of the electric car maker Tesla Inc, issued the apology to Vernon Unsworth on Twitter this morning - but qualified it by saying the diver had insulted him.\n\nIt comes after investors called on him to 'take a Twitter sabbatical' after he 'crossed a line' with the baseless remark.

The fault is mine and mine alone.'\n\nMusk's spat with Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk's offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help extract the youth soccer team and the coach from the labyrinth of partly flooded passages.\n\n'It just has absolutely no chance of working,' CNN quoted Unsworth as saying about the submarine. He also said Musk could 'stick his submarine where it hurts'.\n\nMusk responded on Twitter on Sunday saying: 'We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.'\n\nThe Tweet was later deleted, but the diver said yesterday he had been approached by British and American lawyers and would seek legal advice over Musk's extraordinary tirade.\n\nMr Unsworth said he hadn't flatly denied Musk's accusation because he was waiting for legal advice.\n\nAsked why he thought Musk would make such a comment about him, he said: 'I don't know.'\n\nA police officer in the Chiang Rai, where Unsworth has lived for seven years, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth. The officer declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nVernon Unsworth had earlier suggested he planned to take legal action after Elon Musk accused him of being a paedophile in an extraordinary Twitter attack\n\nMusk labelled the British diver 'pedo guy' in a tweet before later deleting the message\n\nUnsworth, 63, said he hadn't actually met Musk face to face when Musk visited the cave during the rescue.\n\nHe said he felt sorry that the squabble with Musk had detracted from the successful end to the rescue mission.\n\n'It's taken a bit of the pleasure out of what's happened, what we've achieved, for me anyway,' he said, adding that it had upset his ex-wife and daughter back in Britain. 'It's very much upset my daughter,' the caver said, his voice breaking.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc fell more than 3.5 percent on Monday, knocking almost $2 billion off the company's market value.\n\nSeveral analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk's comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla's main business of producing electric cars.\n\nVenture capital firm Loup Ventures issued a statement on behalf of investors this week saying the 'pedo' comment 'crossed the line' and called for an apology.\n\nThe letter said: 'Over the last 6 months, there have been too many examples of concerning behavior that is shaking investor confidence.'\n\nFarting unicorns, Twitter tirades and conference call outbursts: Musk's previous controversies\n\nThe extraordinary tirade aimed at Vern Unsworth is not the first time Elon Musk has sparked controversy.\n\nJust days ago, the US Federal Election Commission released annual filings showing Musk as one of the top 50 donors to a political action committee dedicated to helping Republicans maintain control of the House.\n\nWhile Musk has described himself as 'half Democrat, half Republican' in the past, it struck many as hypocritical that a green energy CEO would donate nearly $40,000 to help keep in power a political party that has largely ignored or denied climate change.\n\nDespite the fact that publicly-available FEC documents prove his donations to the PAC, Musk tweeted on Saturday that 'reports that I am a top donor of the GOP are categorically false'. 'I am not a top donor to any political party,' he said.\n\nIn June, the Tesla CEO became embroiled in a bizarre row over a farting unicorn mug.\n\nTom Edwards, a Colorado potter, said he was delighted when Musk tweeted a photo of one of his colourful unicorn mugs in February 2017 with the tech exec calling the design 'maybe my favorite mug ever'.\n\nBut he was stunned when, just a month later, Musk unveiled a similar cartoon to promote Tesla's new 'sketch pad' feature, which allows drivers to draw via an in-car touchscreen.\n\nMr Edwards' daughter then became involved in a Twitter spat with Musk, who insisted Tesla had received no financial gain from the art work and that they would use another design going forward.\n\nA month earlier, in May this year, it emerged that Musk had launched an extraordinary outburst during a quarterly earnings conference call.\n\nThe billionaire branded one industry analyst a 'boring bonehead' during the bizarre session, saying another's 'questions are so dry they are killing me'.\n\nMusk has also become embroiled in a series of spats with the news media - chastising reporters for focusing on accidents of autonomous cars instead of their safety potential, and accusing one news organisation of being 'relentlessly negative' about Tesla.\n\nLast month, he alleged 'sabotage' at Tesla's operations by an employee, who responded by claiming to be a 'whistleblower'.\n\nIt added: 'The exchange with Vern Unsworth crossed the line. I suspect you would agree given you deleted the string from Twitter, but it will take more than that to regain investor confidence.\n\n'Your behavior is fueling an unhelpful perception of your leadership - thin-skinned and short-tempered.\n\n'Thankfully, the road to regaining investor confidence is well traveled. It starts with an apology. Then, focus your message on your progress toward achieving Tesla's mission. You might consider taking a Twitter sabbatical.'\n\nThis is the most brand-damaging thing Elon Musk has ever done,' said Roger Kay, analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates who follows the technology sector.\n\nKay said Musk appeared to be following in the footsteps of President Donald Trump in using Twitter to vent frustration and insult anyone with whom he disagrees.\n\n'It's totally gratuitous. It wasn't necessary,' Kay said of the Musk insult to the Briton, who has threatened a lawsuit. 'It makes him very Trump-like.'\n\nThe 'Wild Boar' team were rescued last week by a group of foreign and Thai divers through a network of narrow passages and chambers. The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach are expected to leave hospital on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the 'Wild Boars' football team being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai after their rescue\n\nMusk shared images of the camp which was established around the cave mouth\n\nWHAT WAS ELON MUSK'S PLAN TO SAVE THE THAI CHILDREN TRAPPED IN FLOODED TUNNELS?\n\nTwelve young footballers and their 25-year-old coach became trapped in a flooded cave system in Thailand on June 23, 2018.\n\nDivers and other rescue worker worked frantically to come up with a plan to free the youngsters imprisoned in the Tham Luang Nang Non caves.\n\nOn July 6, almost two weeks later, billionaire Elon Musk shared suggestions for those working on the ground after receiving tweets requesting his input.\n\nElon Musk said his Boring Co, which digs tunnels for advanced transport systems, could feed a nylon tube into the submerged sections of the cave before inflating it 'like a bouncy castle' to create an underwater tunnel.\n\nMusk also committed to sending top engineers from his Boring Co. and SpaceX companies to help free the trapped schoolchildren.\n\nAccording to the Tesla CEO, rescuers could use electric pumps to remove water from flooded entrance of the cave network - eliminating one of the bodies of water those trapped would need to cross.\n\nNylon tubes measuring some 3ft (1m) in diameter could then be fed through the cave network to the flooded sections.\n\nBattery packs and air pumps would be used to inflate the nylon tubes, submerged underwater. These tubes would provide an escape tunnel the children could crawl through to safety, Musk suggests.\n\nHowever, Professor John Gunn from the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham and chair of the cave research association, had reservations about details of the scheme.\n\nHe said: 'If you imagine a tunnel under London flooded, this this would be straight with a few bends.\n\n'However, this is more like asking to thread a pipe through all the aisles of a supermarket, up the stairs, down the stairs and then back through the aisles and also in total darkness and underwater.\n\n'You can see it is more complicated. If he was proposing the pipe is moved by divers then I think that's a non-starter.'\n\nUnsworth was the first foreigner called to the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand after relatives noticed the boys had not come out after setting out to explore the cave complex on June 23 following soccer practice.\n\nHe said he has lost count of how many times he has been inside the six-mile long Tham Luang cave.\n\n'It has been my third home for the past six years,' he said.\n\nTwo British divers who were asked by Unsworth to join the mission were the first to discover the boys.\n\nUnsworth said he brought his knowledge about the cave to the rescue mission but added that he 'no idea' what the diving conditions were like because he is not a cave diver.\n\nHe said he will fly from Thailand to London on Thursday, where he will stay for around three weeks.\n\nTrapped Thai cave boys will be released from hospital TODAY: Officials say the children are ready to 'go back to their normal lives'\n\nThai soccer players and their coach who were trapped in a flooded Thai cave for more than two weeks will be allowed to go home today.\n\nThe 'Wild Boars' football team are being discharged from hospital a day earlier than expected and eight days after the last of them were rescued from the cave.\n\nDoctors said the boys will give their first press conference before leaving the hospital when they will be quizzed for 45 minutes by journalists.\n\nHowever, the questioning will be tightly monitored with all queries screened by psychologists beforehand to avoid causing the boys additional trauma.\n\nEleven Thai soccer players and their coach will be released from hospital on Wednesday, eight days after the last of them were rescued from a flooded cave\n\nThe Wild Boars team will give their first ever press conference before leaving hospital, with all questions screened by psychologists first to avoid further trauma\n\n'The reason to hold this evening press conference is so media can ask them questions and after that they can go back to live their normal lives without media bothering them,' chief government spokesman Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said.\n\nCalled 'Sending the Wild Boars Home' and broadcast on major television channels, the session will last for about 45 minutes, Sunsern said, adding that it would be conducted in an informal style with a moderator.\n\n'They are likely to return home immediately after the press conference,' he said.\n\nThailand's junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha urged media Wednesday to be 'cautious in asking unimportant questions' that could cause unspecified damage.\n\n'Today everything is already good, including the perception in foreign countries,' he told reporters in Bangkok.\n\n'Nothing is better than this so we should not make it get worse.'\n\nDoctors have advised families of the boys, aged 11 to 16, that they should avoid letting them contact journalists for at least one month after they are discharged.\n\nThe team spent more than two weeks trapped in the flooded Tham Luang cave before being rescued by an international team of divers\n\nThough they and their coach are all said to be in good mental and physical health, health officials say that additional psychological monitoring will be provided to detect lingering trauma.\n\nThe daring Thai-led international effort to rescue the 'Wild Boars' captivated the world after they walked into the cave on June 23 and were trapped by rising floodwaters.\n\nAfter nine days without a steady supply of food or water they were found emaciated and huddled in a group on a muddy ledge by British divers several kilometres inside Tham Luang.\n\nRescuers debated on the best plan to bring them out but ultimately decided on a risky operation that involved diving them through waterlogged passages while they were sedated to keep them calm and carrying them out in military-grade stretchers.\n\nNot even the foreign cave diving specialists who took part were sure the mission would work and many expressed relief when it was all over after the final five were rescued on July 10.\n\nBy Afp", "Means buyers need to be behind the wheel by end of year to get full tax break\n\nIn March of 2016, Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m., and get a three-hour head start on his West Coast competitors.\n\nTesla was taking $1,000 deposits for its new electric car, the Model 3, priced starting at $35,000.\n\nAnd Reynolds had to have one. He managed to land near the top of the waiting list.\n\nFlash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting.\n\nA Tesla Model 3 sedan, its first car aimed at the mass market, is shown during its launch in Hawthorne, California, March 31, 2016\n\nAnd now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach.\n\n'The tax credit was going to be huge,' says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car.\n\nLast week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 - the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year.\n\nThen it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nThat means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break - essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price.\n\nKeith Reynolds, on the waiting list for a Model 3, is photographed by his 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car. For many on list to buy Tesla's electric car, the wait for firm to produce enough to satisfy demand isn't a major problem. The prospect of losing U.S. federal tax credit is\n\nMany Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm.\n\n'By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,' he said.\n\nTesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list.\n\nBut if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history.\n\nTesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses.\n\nLast week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since start of 2010 - at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable EVs to be phased out\n\nCEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory.\n\nThe company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March.\n\nIn March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year.\n\nTesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits.\n\nMusk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week.\n\nThe company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June.\n\nLike many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more.\n\nAt present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford.\n\nChristian Kingery poses for a photo at his home in Preston, Wash., near Seattle, next to the leased Audi he is driving until he can take delivery of a long-awaited Tesla Model 3, which is shown on his tablet computer\n\nWHAT DID ELON MUSK SAY TO STAFF AFTER TESLA REACHED LANDMARK 5,000 MODEL 3S PRODUCTION A WEEK?\n\nFrom: Elon Musk\n\nTo: Everybody\n\nSubj. 7000\n\nJul. 1, 12:37 PM\n\nWe did it!! What an incredible job by an amazing team. Couldn't be more proud to work with you. It is an honour.\n\nThe level of dedication and creativity was mind-blowing. We either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible.\n\nIntense in tents. Transporting entire production lines across the world in massive cargo planes. Whatever. It worked.\n\nNot only did we factory gate over 5000 Model 3's, but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7000 vehicle week!\n\nWhat's more, with the widespread productivity gains throughout Tesla and the new production lines spooling up, we are on track to reach 6k/week for Model 3 next month.\n\nI think we just became a real car company ...\n\nThank you for your hard work and dedication,\n\nElon\n\nHe wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year.\n\nBeyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and 'if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself.'\n\nOthers on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns.\n\nMost Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit - about 120,000 - are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid.\n\nHe said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. 'If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,' he said.\n\nThe only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site.\n\n(Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.)\n\nKelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero.\n\nThree months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback.\n\nKingery, who is on an official waiting list for his car, says Tesla has told him it could take until between September and November of 2018 for his car to be delivered, but he fears it might be even longer\n\nLindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. 'I've already been on the list for two years,' she said. 'I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year.'\n\nShe doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles.\n\nChristian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits.\n\nHe compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May.\n\nWhen all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September.\n\nAlthough Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car. 'Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,' he said.\n\nLike Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen.\n\nHe will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.", "Maye Musk has become an inspirational figure for many -- beginning with her three children, who have all learned from the tireless work ethic she displayed while raising them as a single mother.\n\nThe model and dietitian, 69, penned an essay for Moneyish to mark International Women's Day explaining how she taught Elon, now 46, Kimbal, 45, and Tosca, 43, how to pursue the projects they took to heart.\n\nShe looked back on the years that followed her divorce in 1979, when she struggled to make ends meet and was solely responsible for making sure her family had a home and enough to eat.\n\nWork ethic: Maye Musk has penned an essay explaining how she taught her children Elon, now 46, Kimbal, 45, and Tosca, 43, how to pursue the projects they took to heart\n\nPast: The model and dietitian (pictured with Elon and Tosca), 69, looked back on the years that followed her divorce in 1979, when she struggled to make ends meet\n\n'When I got divorced, I knew I needed to step it up, so I taught nutrition at a college, modeled and built my dietitian practice all over Canada.

His comments on Twitter became a public cat fight before Musk deleted the posts. Damage to Tesla's reputation may have had already been done, however, and many investors responded immediately and with deep concern.\n\nJames Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, Tesla's fourth-largest shareholder, told The Guardian in an email on Tuesday that the company saw \"the end of carbon as essential\" but was \"frustrated that the real steps towards this are being overshadowed and undermined by this saga.\" Anderson said he agreed with some of Musk's past remarks calling out critical analysts, \"but this is different. We are in contact with the company, and we are hopeful that it is being taken with due seriousness.\" He said he would like to see \"peace, quiet, and execution\" at the all-electric car company.\n\nIf Musk's behavior did not change, \"it could have a dramatic negative impact on the company,\" said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm. \"It has to start with an apology.\" In addition to losing the confidence of investors, Munster said, \"the irony here is that their brand is word of mouth.\" The scandals \"could negatively impact demand and access to capital.\"\n\nLoup Ventures published an open letter to Musk on behalf of investors, saying the comments to Unsworth \"crossed the line\" and calling for an apology. \"Over the last 6 months, there have been too many examples of concerning behavior that is shaking investor confidence,\" the letter said.\n\nJing Zhao, who recently filed a shareholder proposal to remove Musk as chairman of the Tesla board and install an independent director, said the CEO was being unprofessional and that it was \"not his business\" to travel to Thailand and try to directly solve the rescue challenges. Zhao said he believed Musk originally had \"good intentions,\" but that \"humanitarian rescues ... are professional tasks so we should trust others with local community connections. He should focus on his profession,\" Zhao said, adding that if Musk wanted to help these kinds of causes, he should have a separate charity organization. Zhao also said that this scandal offered further evidence that the company needed an independent chair: \"He is not mature enough.\"\n\nOn June 23, 2018, 12 boys went exploring in Thailand's Chiang Rai province with their football coach and ended up trapped deep inside a cave underneath a mountain following flooding.\n\nThe team and their young coach were ready to celebrate a team member's birthday, having often ventured deep into Tham Luang, sometimes as far as 8km, for initiation rites where they would write the names of new team members on a cave wall. The BBC describes them as being in high spirits; they explored into the cave with just their torches. They didn't need much else -- after all, they were only planning to be there for an hour.\n\nThe football team did not emerge until 2 weeks later.\n\nRescue attempts were initially stymied by desperate cave conditions as well as the lack of diving training necessary for the youth to swim to safety in underground shafts. Compelled by the situation, Musk flew to Thailand and offered to assist by providing a \"mini-submarine.\" He and a team of engineers from SpaceX and The Boring Company brought over the vessel -- a cylinder made out of the liquid oxygen transfer tube of a Falcon rocket. In Thailand, Musk also met with government officials there about the possibility of using it to help.\n\nBut Narongsak Osottanakorn, head of the command center during the rescue, did not welcome the idea, saying the sub was \"technologically sophisticated\" but \"not practical\" with the rescue mission. Musk then hit out at reports referring to Osottanakorn as \"rescue chief,\" noting that he was the former provincial governor of Chiang Rai and not the \"subject matter expert.\" Osottanakorn stepped down from his role to join the initiative. Musk shared email communications he had with a top member of the rescue team, in which he was told to keep working on the mini-sub because they might need it.\n\nUltimately, frustrated by many criticisms of his effort to help, and perhaps from being rejected and hurt that his offer was dismissed as not a good match for the situation at hand, Musk reacted to a subsequent comment by Unsworth, a 63-year-old British diver who called the project a \"PR stunt.\" He added that the billionaire could \"stick his submarine where it hurts.\"\n\nMusk responded by promising to create a video proving his \"mini-sub\" would have worked, adding: \"Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nThe diver, who was still at the cave site assisting with clean-up, told The Guardian he was \"astonished and very angry\" and was considering legal action.\n\nThe media firestorm that resulted from the accusation prompted the Musk apology. Musk felt validated in his original defense. \"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,\" Musk said. \"The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nThe Musk apology also referred to a \"well-written article\" by Jeremy Arnold, whose essential argument is as follows:\n\nMusk is \"a wealthy problem-solver with a long history of responding to charity requests on Twitter is asked to see what he can do to help. He agrees, opens dialogue for ideas, takes them to the on-the-ground experts for feedback, then sends some of his best engineers to work pro bono on practical mechanics.\"\n\nShares of Tesla barely moved in after-hours trade on Tuesday, down about a 10th of a percent.

Doctors said all are healthy.", "When the Golden State Warriors, who won three of the last four NBA championships, signed All-Star Demarcus Cousins, sports pundits across the country offered the same opinion: The rich just got richer.\n\nIn many respects, the same holds true for energy subsidies.\n\nFederal energy programs promise ambiguous policy goals such as abating climate change, spurring innovation, or reducing dependence on foreign sources of energy. But they often lead to situations that help the rich at the expense of middle- and lower-income Americans. That's because when the federal government gets involved in the energy business, it transfers billions of dollars to the production and consumption of politically preferred sources and technologies -- and many of those involve the poor transferring money to the rich.\n\nFor instance, a recent study by the Pacific Research Institute found that more than 99 percent of subsidies for electrical vehicles go to households with incomes of $50,000 or higher, and nearly three-quarters go to households with an annual income of $100,000 or more.\n\nPoorer Americans can't access the $7,500 tax credits because of the high prices of electric vehicles, even after accounting for the generous subsidies, which means they help pay for the subsidies through their taxes but can't themselves get eligible for the subsidies or other benefits, such as carpool lanes.\n\nTo make matters worse, some major car companies are forced to sell electric vehicles at a loss to comply with state mandates and regulations. As Wayne Winegarden of the Pacific Research Institute explains:\n\nCalifornia, along with the nine states that have adopted California's policy, mandates that zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) comprise a set percentage of the automobile market. The mandated minimum market share for ZEVs is currently scheduled to grow from 4.5 percent of sales in 2018, to 22 percent of the market by 2025; and Gov. Jerry Brown is even contemplating a complete ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines after 2040.\n\nComplying with these mandates requires companies to maintain ZEV credits that equal their share of the mandate, based on the company's specific sales. Acquiring sufficient credits requires manufacturers that do not sell enough ZEVs to either sell ZEVs in California at a loss, purchase credits from companies whose ZEV sales exceed their credit requirements, or pay a $5,000 fine per credit that the company is short.\n\nConsequently, the sales mandate has become a subsidy to companies, such as Tesla, that sell more ZEV-qualified vehicles than required by the mandate; and, a penalty on companies whose ZEV sales fall short of the required mandate. The $700 million earned by Tesla via these credit sales, which does not even account for all the credits Tesla has amassed, exemplifies that these subsidies and penalties can be substantial.\n\nEnergy subsidies benefit not only wealthy individuals, but also wealthy companies in the form of blatant corporate welfare. The federal government's loan guarantee program is another subsidy program where government-backed loans have, time and again, gone to companies that simply don't need any support from the taxpayer.\n\nYou don't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to see that some of these projects have financial backing from giant tech firms, massive energy utilities, large investment banks, and other successful corporations.\n\nThe Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program granted more than $1 billion in loans for Nissan and Ford to retool their factories. This program is simply a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to these massive companies. These companies should have no trouble financing a project without government-backed loans if they find it is worth the investment.\n\nEliminating favoritism in markets will benefit all Americans -- individuals and businesses alike -- not just the privileged few.", "Elon Musk personally dialed up the head of the environmental group the Sierra Club and asked him to help deflect criticism over donations to Republicans by Tesla Inc.'s chairman, according to an email that the head of the nonprofit sent to his staff.

It is the latest major order for Boeing with a list price of more than $12 billion.\n\nBoeing also received a commitment from Volga DPNER to buy 34 freighter planes, DHL for 14 Boeing 777 freighters and a nearly $10 billion deal with Air Lease Corp for 78 new Boeing aircraft.\n\nUnited Airlines also announced purchase of four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.\n\nOn the other hand, Boeing's rival Airbus has gathered list price deals worth around $52 billion, according to a report by CNBC.\n\nAn undisclosed customer has agreed to purchase 80 A320neo jets worth around $8.8 billion. Airbus' other deals included a $5.5 billion A220 order from the new airline being set up by Jet Blue founder David Neeleman.\n\nTaiwanese startup carrier Starlux has ordered deals for 17 while China's Sichuan Airlines ordered 10 Airbus A350-900 aircraft.\n\nFuture of the A380\n\nTalking about the future of the troubled A380 super-jumbo project, Tom Williams, head of Airbus' aircraft operations has said claimed its \"best years are ahead of us\".\n\nWhile it was the first time that Airbus' flagship aircraft was absent from the Farnborough Airshow since the project took off, Williams said the absence had nothing to do with plunging sales, according to a report by BBC.\n\nThe A380 is one of the costliest aircraft projects and has been not found enough customers since inception.\n\nThe three-seat hybrid-electric vehicle will be able to take off and land vertically. While the concept aircraft has unveiled at the airshow, Aston Martin is hoping to have a flying version ready in two years.\n\nTempest: United Kingdom has unveiled a model of its planned fighter jet called Tempest. According to a report by BBC, UK's Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson has said the jet could be used with either pilots or as a drone and will take flight by 2035.\n\nThe aircraft, developed by BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and missile expert MBDA, is planned to replace the Typhoon fighter jet.\n\nWilliamson also said UK would be investing 2 billion Pounds in the Tempest project.Airbus also showcased the newly renamed A220, which was formerly the Bombardier CSeries.", "FARNBOROUGH, U.K. (July 19, 2018) -\n\nRockwell Collins was honored with a Customer Services Award for its avionics service by Airbus and its customer airlines at a special ceremony at the Farnborough Air Show held yesterday.\n\nThe award, which put Rockwell Collins in the top five of 43 companies, is based on in-service feedback on product, service, support and cost from more than 165 Airbus customers worldwide.\n\n'Our long-standing relationship with Airbus and its airline customers is one that we are very proud of,' said Scott Gunnufson, vice president of Sales, Marketing and Customer Support, Commercial Systems for Rockwell Collins.

We definitely need more planes,\" Fernandes told a news conference late on Tuesday, when asked if any decision had been taken on AirAsia's plane orders.\n\nAsked whether he would travel to Farnborough, the Malaysian entrepreneur said: \"No. I'm not planning to go anywhere right now.\"\n\nIndustry sources have said AirAsia is discussing the possible purchase of another 100 Airbus A321neo jets as the airline and Airbus go down to the wire in parallel negotiations for an expanded order for larger A330neo jets.\n\nAirAsia has been a steadfast Airbus narrow-body and wide-body customer, but recently the company has talked to Boeing about buying its 787 jet as an alternative to the A330neo, a person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nDelegates say Airbus needs a marketing lift for its A330neo and would relish bringing Fernandes to the widely publicised Farnborough Airshow to reconfirm and expand his order.\n\nAsked about the Boeing option at an industry event in London on Tuesday, AirAsia Chairman Kamarudin Meranun said: \"We talk to everybody. Everything is a possibility until the day we announce it.\"\n\nAirAsia X is Airbus' biggest customer for the slow-selling A330neo with 66 on order. The loss of the order would be a major blow for the European planemaker.\n\nFernandes said this month that AirAsia's long-haul affiliate AirAsia X needed to ensure the price, performance and engines of the A330neo were right before confirming its 66-jet order.\n\nWhen asked about the direction of oil prices, Fernandes said he expected oil prices to drift lower.\n\nBrent futures rose 9 cents to $71.93 a barrel, after earlier trading as low as $71.35 a barrel, its lowest since April 17.

BAE System's CEO said international partners would be brought in to help to develop Britain's proposed new fighter jet in 2019, also signalling that teaming up with a rival Franco-German project in future was possible.\n\nBAE showed off a model of the new warplane, Tempest, on Monday, linking up with a group of industrial partners to fulfil a government plan for a new combat jet by 2040. Britain said the project would need international partners to help to take it forward.\n\nCharles Woodburn, CEO of BAE Systems, Britain\u00b4s biggest defence company, said the plan was to bring those partners onboard during 2019.\n\n\"In terms of the timeframes for international partnerships, we\u00b4ve talked about...2019,\" he told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow on Tuesday.\n\nThe launch of Tempest has raised questions about the future of European defence cooperation, given that Germany and France launched their own fighter jet programme a year ago.\n\nThis programme is led by France's Airbus, part of the Eurofighter consortium and Dassault Aviation SA, the maker of the Rafale.\n\nIndustry executives have said that the Tempest project could at some stage be merged with the rival Franco-German plan, although Britain is trying to negotiate its departure from the European Union in March 2019, making any tie-up tricky for the time being.\n\nWoodburn said no partners had been ruled out.\n\n\"I think the UK government has an open mind on this and will keep an open mind,\" he said. \"Our view is that it\u00b4s a team sport building next generation systems and to use a footballing analogy you really do want the strongest players around the table and that\u00b4s in all of our interests to do that.\"\n\nAsked about Brexit, Woodburn said the impact on BAE Systems was limited, but noted that one area where the company could be affected was on the Tempest project.\n\n\"Team tempest, that is, from a Brexit perspective, is where it can or could affect us in future,\" he said.

The A330-800neo combines low operating costs, long range flying capability and high levels of comfort. We are looking forward to launch operations and offer our customers best-in-class service\", said Ephraim Bagenda, CEO of Uganda Airlines.\n\nUganda Airlines plans to use the A330-800neos to build its international long-haul network with the aircraft offering cutting-edge technologies along with most efficient operations. The aircraft will feature a three-class cabin layout comprising 20 Business, 28 Premium Economy and 213 Economy seats.\n\n\"We are delighted to welcome Uganda Airlines among our A330neo customers, the A330neo will bring a range of benefits offering unrivalled efficiencies combined with the most modern cabin. We look forward to see the A330-800neo flying in the colours of Uganda\", said Eric Schulz, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.\n\nLaunched in July 2014, the A330neo Family is the new generation A330, comprising two versions: the A330-800 and A330-900 sharing 99 percent commonality.\n\nIt builds on the proven economics, versatility and reliability of the A330 Family, while reducing fuel consumption by about 25 percent per seat versus previous generation competitors and increasing range by up to 1,500 nm compared to the majority of A330s in operation.\n\nThe A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce's latest-generation Trent 7000 engines and features a new wing with increased span and new A350 XWB-inspired Sharklets.

The production lines at Boeing and its European rival Airbus are already booked up for years ahead.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian airline Volga Dnepr committed to buying Boeing freight aircraft worth $11.8bn at list prices, while Airbus announced a provisional deal with an unnamed customer for 100 of its A320 jets.\n\nAnd US aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corp announced a commitment to order as many as 78 Boeing single-aisle and wide-body airplanes in a deal valued at $9.6bn at catalogue prices.\n\nChina climbs\n\nBoeing's upbeat sales forecast underlined the importance of China to the aircraft industry. One in four of Boeing's passenger aircraft went to Chinese customers last year.\n\nThe company's commercial marketing chief, Randy Tinseth, told a press conference at Farnborough that he expected China to overtake the US as the world's largest domestic air travel market within 10-15 years.\n\nAlso, he said, demand for cargo aircraft would also increase on the back of e-commerce, with Chinese traders and consumers accounting for the biggest single rise.\n\nHowever, Mr Tinseth declined to comment on whether Boeing's growth in China could be hindered by a trade war. \"We are going to focus on what we can control,\" he said.\n\nThe company's sales forecast for the next two decades predicts a 5% rise to 31,360 in demand for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, which are popular with low-cost airlines.\n\nSales in the larger, wide-bodied bracket were expected to fall by just 140 to 8,070 aircraft over the next 20 years, but only because longer-range single-aisle jets were eating into the market, Mr Tinseth said.\n\nBoeing trimmed its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Competition in this sector is expected to intensify, as Airbus has taken over Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme and Boeing is buying Embraer.", "A British tourist and mother-of-two has described the terrifying moment she thought her life was about to end when the plane she was on had its tail sliced off in a collision with another aircraft.\n\nKaarina Barron, 55, from Woodley, Berkshire, and her friend Clare Chambers were seated near the back of the plane when they heard an almighty bang.\n\nThe shocking crash 'sounded like a bomb had gone off' and took place yesterday at Attaturk Airport in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nIt saw a Turkish Airline plane have its tail sliced off by an Asiana Airline plane, sending passengers on-board flying.\n\nMs Barron, who is a business development manager for Qwerty LTD, a printing company in Theale, Berks said: 'We'd just pulled into the parking bay.

One in four of Boeing's passenger aircraft went to Chinese customers last year.\n\nThe company's commercial marketing chief, Randy Tinseth, told a press conference at Farnborough that he expected China to overtake the US as the world's largest domestic air travel market within 10-15 years.\n\nAlso, he said, demand for cargo aircraft would also increase on the back of e-commerce, with Chinese traders and consumers accounting for the biggest single rise.\n\nHowever, Mr Tinseth declined to comment on whether Boeing's growth in China could be hindered by a trade war. \"We are going to focus on what we can control,\" he said.\n\nThe company's sales forecast for the next two decades predicts a 5% rise to 31,360 in demand for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, which are popular with low-cost airlines.\n\nSales in the larger, wide-bodied bracket were expected to fall by just 140 to 8,070 aircraft over the next 20 years, but only because longer-range single-aisle jets were eating into the market, Mr Tinseth said.\n\nBoeing trimmed its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Competition in this sector is expected to intensify, as Airbus has taken over Bombardier's C-Series aircraft programme and Boeing is buying Embraer.", "On August 1 a 10-year-old, Airbus SE A380 formerly flown by Singapore Airlines will enter service with a new carrier, said Paulo Mirpuri, chief executive officer of aircraft lessor Hi Fly.\n\nThe world's largest passenger jet is finally getting a second life.\n\nOn August 1 a 10-year-old, Airbus SE A380 formerly flown by Singapore Airlines will enter service with a new carrier, said Paulo Mirpuri, chief executive officer of aircraft lessor Hi Fly. He said he has two candidates interested in flying the refurbished, 471-seat, jumbo jet: a large European airline seeking its first A380 for flights across the North Atlantic, and an East Asian carrier that already has a fleet of the double-decker.\n\n\"We believe there is quite strong potential for the A380,\" Mirpuri said in an interview. \"It is a good aircraft for high-density airports where slots are restricted and cannot easily be added. Our clients want an aircraft that's able to fly more passengers.\" A decision is due next week on which of the customers, whom he declined to name, will receive the plane.\n\nHi Fly's leasing deal would extend the usefulness of a plane that has been popular with travelers but has become an embarrassment for Airbus since it was introduced 10 years ago. As the planemaker and rival Boeing Co. introduced twin-engine wide-bodies, interest in the the fuel-thirsty, four-engine A380 has stalled and airlines are eager to upgrade. While jetliners usually fly for more than 25 years, often in the second-hand market, A380 buyers risk holding aging jets that no one wants. That makes it hard to get the most from a plane that lists today for almost $450 million.\n\nPyrenees Scrapyard\n\nThe A380 suffered an indignity last month when German investment fund Dr. Peters said it will would send two planes to the scrapyard after just a decade in service, failing after a year to find new operators. The jets are parked in the foothills of the French Pyrenees, where they will be filleted and sold for parts. Like the Hi Fly plane, they are from a batch of five leased to Singapore Air that the carrier is replacing.\n\nHi Fly will lease its A380, the only one it has, and provide it with crews and insurance to airlines that have short-term needs. That can be from a month, to be used when other planes are out for maintenance, to two years, while a carrier waits for the delivery of factory-fresh aircraft. The Portugal-based lessor will need to find several clients over the next six years to get the most out of its plane.\n\nHi Fly wants to add more A380s to its lineup of 20 twin-aisle jets, Mirpuri said. It plans to also offer a high-density layout with about 800 economy seats plus a small business class, providing almost double the capacity of some older Boeing 747-400s in a newer plane with an equivalent operating cost.\n\n\"We do believe in the second life of the A380. If you expect 25 years of operation, this aircraft has passed just over one-third of its commercial life,\" he said. Costs for airlines leasing older A380s will be reasonable, \"while still allowing for a decent margin for Hi Fly.\"", "The 2016 coup attempt saw parliament bombed by military aircraft and more than 250 people killed.\n\nTurkey announces end to state of emergency after two years\n\n10:17 * 19/07\n\nFacebook defends Holocaust deniers' right to be wrong\n\n10:09 * 19/07\n\nIsrael approves controversial 'Jewish state' law\n\n09:55 * 19/07\n\nNATO chief says Georgia, not Russia, must decide on NATO membership\n\n09:49 * 19/07\n\nTrump holds Putin 'responsible' for election meddling\n\nKhachatur Kokobelyan: United States is interested in boosting investments in Armenia\n\n18:15 * 18/07\n\nArmenian society 'enthusiastic' about new government's social reforms -

the first of its kind to be harpooned in more than 50 years", "Over the past few years, Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus have experienced a slump in wide-body orders, even as airlines have continued to buy narrow-bodies like the 737 and A320 at a frenetic pace. This downshift in order activity caused Boeing's backlog for models like the 747 and 777 to erode, forcing the aerospace giant to slash production of those models.\n\nDemand for passenger variants of the 747 and the current-generation 777 has slowed to a crawl. With fuel prices on the rise again, airlines are understandably tilting toward more fuel-efficient models, like Boeing's own 787 Dreamliner family.\n\nHowever, cargo airlines are starting to pick up the slack. At this week's Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced several orders for 747 and 777 freighters, helping it rebuild those aircraft families' order backlogs.\n\nThe cargo market is bouncing back\n\nPrior to 2017, the air cargo market was under pressure due to a combination of slow demand growth (driven by economic slowdowns in some key emerging markets) and excess capacity (driven by belly cargo space on passenger aircraft flying new long-haul routes).\n\nHowever, falling airfares and rising oil prices have caused global airlines to pull back on growth. Meanwhile, demand rebounded last year due to a strengthening global economy. Air cargo volume surged 9% in 2017, up from just 3.6% growth in 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nDemand for freight aircraft is finally bouncing back from a deep slump. Image source: Boeing.\n\nThis improved supply-demand balance is finally driving a long-awaited recovery in the market for dedicated freighters. Boeing has been capitalizing on this rebound. For example, in the first half of 2018, it captured an order for 14 747-8Fs and four 767-300Fs from United Parcel Service and a deal for 12 767-300Fs and 12 777Fs from FedEx.\n\nBoeing continues its freighter momentum at Farnborough\n\nDuring the first two days of the Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced three more freighter deals covering the 747-8F and 777F models. First, Qatar Airways firmed up an order for five 777Fs that had first been announced as a commitment a few months ago.\n\nSecond, Boeing announced a firm order and commitment from DHL for 14 777Fs, with purchase rights for another seven. The first four deliveries are scheduled for 2019. Boeing stated that it previously added some of these orders to its backlog without identifying the customer. (This likely refers to an order for 10 777Fs booked by Boeing last month and attributed to an unidentified customer.) The remaining firm orders will be added to the backlog at a later date.\n\nThird, Russian cargo specialist Volga-Dnepr Group confirmed an order for five 747-8Fs and signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 29 777Fs. If the latter deal is firmed up, it would be the largest order for current-generation 777s since 2011. That said, Volga-Dnepr announced a \"commitment\" for 20 747-8Fs in 2015 and an \"agreement\" for the same 20 aircraft in 2016, but most of those orders were never firmed up. Thus, it's wise to take the new LOI with a grain of salt.\n\nFilling in the order gaps\n\nAs of the end of June, Boeing had 23 unfilled orders for 747s and 101 unfilled orders for current-generation 777s. The deals announced at Farnborough will add to those totals, ensuring that the 747 line will keep running well into the 2020s and protecting the 777 line from further cuts.\n\nBoeing still doesn't have enough 747 or 777 firm orders to contemplate returning to the higher production rates in place just a few years ago. But at least it's finally seeing some order momentum, which could pave the way for an eventual return to higher production of the 777 family -- if not the 747 -- a few years down the road.\n\nMore From The Motley Fool\n\n10 Best Stocks to Buy Today 3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now 5 Warren Buffett Principles to Remember in a Volatile Stock Market The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss The Must-Read Trump Quote on Social Security 10 Reasons Why I'm Selling All of My Apple Stock\n\nAdam Levine-Weinberg has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This comes in recognition of the UAE's efforts to encourage youth in the field of space science and technology. The announcement was made during this year's YPS conference currently held in Barcelona from 17 till 21 July.\n\nYPS is an initiative launched by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to bring scientists, practitioners, engineers and leaders of space industry and agencies together in a single venue to discuss recent research breakthroughs, technical advances, existing opportunities and emerging space technologies.\n\nHis Excellency Yousuf Hamad Al Shaibani, Director General of the MBRSC, said \"Hosting the 4 YPS Conference 2019 supports our belief in the youth's capabilities to promote the space sector and make major achievements in this vital area. This is supported by the fact that the average age of Emirati employees at the space centre is no more than 28 years old. Our success in hosting YPS conference also reflects the confidence of the organising committee with UAE's space exploration's ambitions, represented by MBRSC's programmes and initiatives. It also reinforces the UAE's position as a leading global conference destination and an organiser for major international events and conferences. This confirms our commitment to support the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to position the UAE as one of the leading countries in the field of space science, making this sector a key supporter of the development processes the country is undertaking in all sectors.\"\n\n\"The YPS conference discusses recent research breakthroughs, technical advances, existing opportunities and emerging space technologies. It is a valuable opportunity for Arab youth who are interested in the space sector to connect with and learn from space experts and scientists from all over the world through workshops that enable them to understand the requirements of the space sector. It also allows them to learn about the latest technologies and opportunities in this sector, and how advanced space technologies can contribute to finding solutions for the future of humanity,\" added Al Shaibani.\n\nA delegation from MBRSC is participating in the current session of the Young Professionals in Space conference, which is hosted in Barcelona, Spain from July 17-21. The 5-day conference is witnessing over 30 meetings led by prominent speakers from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), Boeing, Airbus, Virgin Orbit, the University of Colorado and leading global space agencies. The participants are discussing various fields, mainly, the current programmes and the future challenges in the space sector, the importance of developing early techniques to reduce the risks of space missions, generating photovoltaic (PV) energy in space, and the space environment and heat control. At the end of the conference, the participants will witness several experiences in the design and launch of CanSat in Spanish cities.\n\nSince its establishment in 2006, MBRSC has been adopting a methodology to transfer knowledge and build youth's capabilities; at the early stages this was achieved through gaining expertise in space science and technology from global partners. The experience has culminated into launching DubaiSat-1 and DubaiSat-2. Through building the center's capabilities and transferring knowledge from MBRSC engineers and scientists to their new colleagues, KhalifaSat- a 100% Emirati developed satellite, will be launched in the last quarter of 2018, as well as the Mars Hope Probe, which will be launched in 2020 to reach Mars orbit by 2021. This coincides with the 50 anniversary of the formation of the UAE.", "Over the past few years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus have experienced a slump in wide-body orders, even as airlines have continued to buy narrow-bodies like the 737 and A320 at a frenetic pace. This downshift in order activity caused Boeing's backlog for models like the 747 and 777 to erode, forcing the aerospace giant to slash production of those models.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Motley Fool.\n\nDemand for passenger variants of the 747 and the current-generation 777 has slowed to a crawl. With fuel prices on the rise again, airlines are understandably tilting toward more fuel-efficient models, like Boeing's own 787 Dreamliner family.\n\nHowever, cargo airlines are starting to pick up the slack. At this week's Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced several orders for 747 and 777 freighters, helping it rebuild those aircraft families' order backlogs.\n\nThe cargo market is bouncing back\n\nPrior to 2017, the air cargo market was under pressure due to a combination of slow demand growth (driven by economic slowdowns in some key emerging markets) and excess capacity (driven by belly cargo space on passenger aircraft flying new long-haul routes).\n\nHowever, falling airfares and rising oil prices have caused global airlines to pull back on growth. Meanwhile, demand rebounded last year due to a strengthening global economy. Air cargo volume surged 9% in 2017, up from just 3.6% growth in 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nThis improved supply-demand balance is finally driving a long-awaited recovery in the market for dedicated freighters. Boeing has been capitalizing on this rebound. For example, in the first half of 2018, it captured an order for 14 747-8Fs and four 767-300Fs from United Parcel Service and a deal for 12 767-300Fs and 12 777Fs from FedEx.\n\nA Boeing 787-8 puts on a display at the Farnborough Airshow, in Farnborough, Britain, July 16, 2018. Photo: REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nBoeing continues its freighter momentum at Farnborough\n\nDuring the first two days of the Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced three more freighter deals covering the 747-8F and 777F models. First, Qatar Airways firmed up an order for five 777Fs that had first been announced as a commitment a few months ago.\n\nSecond, Boeing announced a firm order and commitment from DHL for 14 777Fs, with purchase rights for another seven. The first four deliveries are scheduled for 2019. Boeing stated that it previously added some of these orders to its backlog without identifying the customer. (This likely refers to an order for 10 777Fs booked by Boeing last month and attributed to an unidentified customer.) The remaining firm orders will be added to the backlog at a later date.\n\nThird, Russian cargo specialist Volga-Dnepr Group confirmed an order for five 747-8Fs and signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 29 777Fs. If the latter deal is firmed up, it would be the largest order for current-generation 777s since 2011. That said, Volga-Dnepr announced a \"commitment\" for 20 747-8Fs in 2015 and an \"agreement\" for the same 20 aircraft in 2016, but most of those orders were never firmed up. Thus, it's wise to take the new LOI with a grain of salt.\n\nFilling in the order gaps\n\nAs of the end of June, Boeing had 23 unfilled orders for 747s and 101 unfilled orders for current-generation 777s. The deals announced at Farnborough will add to those totals, ensuring that the 747 line will keep running well into the 2020s and protecting the 777 line from further cuts.\n\nBoeing still doesn't have enough 747 or 777 firm orders to contemplate returning to the higher production rates in place just a few years ago. But at least it's finally seeing some order momentum, which could pave the way for an eventual return to higher production of the 777 family -- if not the 747 -- a few years down the road.\n\nAdam Levine-Weinberg has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Part of these materials will be made in and supplied from \u00d6stringen, Germany, where Solvay opened a state-of-the-art resin facility in 2016 largely dedicated to the LEAP program.Solvay is leveraging next-generation assets and will continue investing to support the LEAP program.\n\n'Solvay's composite material technology, expertise and secure supply chain will continue to support Safran in the production of this highly innovative engine in the years to come. The LEAP engine's design fully leverages the benefits of composite materials to reduce fuel consumption, CO\u2082 emissions, noise levels and maintenance costs,'said Carmelo Lo Faro, President of Solvay's Composite Materials Global Business Unit.\n\nSafran Vice President, Materials Purchasing, Thierry Viguier, stated that: 'Solvay has been a long term trusted supplier of Safran, supplying advanced composite materials on several engine and nacelle programs. This agreement highlights not only the continuation of the cooperation on the LEAP program but also the reinforcement of the relationship between the two groups on a larger portfolio.'\n\nFollow us on twitter @SolvayGroup\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nSolvay SA published this content on 19 July 2018 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.

It also firmed up an order for another 25 A321neos. The changes take the airline's order book to 80 A320-family aircraft.\n\nViva Aerobus chief executive Gian Carlo Nucci said the decision to introduce the A321neo \"reflects our long-term commitment to cost reduction, to innovation, operational and environmental efficiency, and enhancing our passenger experience.\n\n\"These additional aircraft will allow us to capture opportunities in Mexico, and we can think of no aircraft better suited than the A321neo with 240 seats with which to endeavour our growth objectives.\"\n\nAirbus also announced a Memorandum of Understanding signed at the Airshow for six A330neos. The company's website quotes the price of the smaller A330-800 for the agreement, but didn't stipulate which model was in the agreement. Six A330-800s would come in at USD$1.68 billion at current list prices.\n\nUganda Airlines also signed a Memorandum of Understanding at Farnborough for two A330-800s. If the order is firmed up it will be worth USD$561 million at list prices.\n\nThe airline said it would use the A330neos to build its international long-haul network, and would take the aircraft in a three-class layout, with 20 business, 28 premium economy and 213 economy class seats.\n\nThe A330neo announcements represent better news for Airbus who, prior to today's interest, had sold only 224 A330-900s. The only firm order for the smaller -800 from Hawaiian Airlines was cancelled earlier this year as the carrier opted for Boeing 787-9s instead.", "\"We believe there is quite strong potential for the A380,\" Mirpuri said in an interview. \"It is a good aircraft for high-density airports where slots are restricted and cannot easily be added. Our clients want an aircraft that's able to fly more passengers.\" A decision is due next week on which of the customers, whom he declined to name, will receive the plane.\n\nHi Fly's leasing deal would extend the usefulness of a plane that has been popular with travelers but has become an embarrassment for Airbus since it was introduced 10 years ago. As the planemaker and rival Boeing Co. introduced twin-engine wide-bodies, interest in the the fuel-thirsty, four-engine A380 has stalled and airlines are eager to upgrade. While jetliners usually fly for more than 25 years, often in the second-hand market, A380 buyers risk holding aging jets that no one wants. That makes it hard to get the most from a plane that lists today for almost $450 million.", "Britain is about to become a nation of stockpilers. As Westminster goes round in bitter, prevaricating circles, companies from aerospace giant Airbus to pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca are publicly signalling the pragmatic steps they will begin taking in order to mitigate against the prospect of a \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nThe British government is also said to be drawing up plans for the stockpiling of processed foods, in just one of hundreds of contingency measures that envisage what might happen if the UK's customs arrangements were to change overnight and throwing its ports into chaos. These plans are billed in some quarters as a way of showing Brussels that Theresa May was not bluffing when she said no deal was better than a bad deal. But such is the abject nature of the political crisis in London, that the scenario they envisage looks less unlikely by the day.\n\nLikewise, an EU draft document is advising member states to deepen their contingency planning for the possibility that the UK will crash out of the EU without agreeing a formal \"divorce\", and the topic was also the focus of Wednesday's Cabinet meeting at Derrynane House in Kerry.\n\nMeanwhile, comments from Arla Foods that dairy goods will become \"luxury\" goods in Britain whichever way it leaves the EU, with certain speciality cheeses becoming \"very scarce\", is another reminder of the bizarreness of this self-inflicted wound.\n\nBrexiteers like to label all such claims, from job losses to empty supermarket cheese displays, as Project Fear, just as they did throughout the referendum campaign. But people are right to be afraid of the economic consequences of a hard Brexit and right to be afraid, too, of the cavalier cabal in Westminster that has brought them to this pathetic point.", "Emirates' iconic A380 aircraft will operate a one-off flight to Kotoka International Airport (ACC), Accra, on Tuesday 2nd October, as the global airline joins local authorities in celebrating the opening of the airport's new Terminal three (3).\n\nThe airline's flagship double-decker will become the first-ever scheduled A380 service to Ghana, with Emirates partnering with the airport to test its operations and infrastructure to accommodate an A380 service.\n\nThe one-off A380 flight EK787 from Dubai, will arrive at 11:35 hours and be on ground for more than six hours before it returns to Dubai as flight EK788 departing at 17:50 hours.\n\nMr Orhan Abbas, Emirates' Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations - Africa, said \"We have enjoyed a close relationship with Ghana as a strategic hub to West Africa for over a decade, and are honoured to bring our flagship A380 to this vibrant city.\n\n\"The launch of Terminal Three (3) is a milestone in Ghana's aviation history and we support every effort to facilitate greater trade links, grow tourism and boost cargo to the region.\n\n\"Our customers are at the heart of everything we do, and our trademark A380 experience is very popular with our customers including Ghanaians who have flown on it to popular destinations like London, Beijing and Guangzhou,\" he said.\n\nMr Abbas said they took great pride in showcasing their unique products and services on the aircraft such as the Onboard Lounge and Shower Spa, to travellers between Dubai and Ghana for the first time.\n\nHe expressed his gratitude for the support they had received from the Ghanaian government, particularly; the Ministry of Aviation and the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, and he thank them for their continuous support.\n\nEmirates commenced operations to Ghana in January 2004 and flies to Accra daily from Dubai.\n\nClose to 1.6 million passengers have flown the Dubai - Accra route since it started, with popular destinations being China, India and the United Kingdom via its Dubai hub.\n\nIn 2017-18, Emirates transported over 6,300 tons of cargo to and from the country, supporting businesses and exporters.\n\nThe main commodities exported from Ghana bound for the UAE and beyond to the Emirates network include fresh and cut fruits.\n\nThe Emirates A380 flying to Accra will be set in a three-class configuration, with 426 seats in Economy Class on the main deck, 76 flat-bed seats in Business Class and 14 First Class Private Suites on the upper deck. Once the A380 reaches cruising altitude, passengers in the First Class can enjoy private suites, and shower spas, an onboard lounge for First Class and Business Class passengers that offer a wide range of drinks and canap\u00e9s, as well as space to socialise or simply relax at 40,000 feet.\n\nPassengers travelling on the main deck in Economy Class can enjoy stretching out in seats with a pitch of up to 33 inches. Passengers in all classes will enjoy Emirates' multi-award-winning in-flight entertainment system, ice, offering over 3,500 channels of on-demand entertainment.\n\nThe largest selection of programming in the sky includes a broad selection of movies, shows, music and another programming from Africa, and up to 20MB complimentary on-board Wi-Fi.\n\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the Emirates A380. As the largest operator of the double-decker aircraft, Emirates' currently has 104 A380s in service and 58 pending delivery, more than any airline globally.\n\nThe airline also recently announced a US$ 16billion (AED 58.7 billion) deal for 36 additional Airbus A380 aircraft.", "Singapore Airlines is set to re-launch a non-stop journey that's a gruelling 19 hours long, from New York to Singapore.\n\nIt's thought that the route will be offered later this year.\n\nThe carrier previously operated the long haul route until 2013.\n\nSingapore Airlines is set to re-launch a non-stop journey that's a gruelling 19 hours long, from New York to Singapore\n\nSingapore Airlines says that due to demand the service will resume with the help of a brand new aircraft.\n\nThe plane in question will be Airbus' new 'ultra-long range' version of its A350-900, of which Singapore Airlines is the launch customer.\n\nThe high-tech newly converted planes will have the capability of flying up to 19 hours using an increased fuel capacity system that pump through 165,000 litres, up from 141,000.\n\n'Our customers have been asking us to re-start non-stop Singapore-US flights and we are pleased that Airbus was able to offer the right aircraft to do so in a commercially viable manner,' said Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong.\n\nThe airline has placed an order for 67 of the Airbus A350s, and as more of the efficient planes are added to the fleet, the plan is to resume the 19-hour Singapore-LA route in the near future as well.\n\nAt the moment, fliers wishing to make the 8,700-nautical-mile journey to the Big Apple from Singapore have to face the delights of a 22-hour journey, with at least one connection.\n\nLA-bound passengers have a slightly shorter ordeal, with the trip currently taking around 17 hours or more, also with a stop.\n\nAt the moment, fliers wishing to make the 8,700-nautical-mile journey to the Big Apple from Singapore have to face the delights of a 22-hour journey, with at least one connection\n\nTHE WORLD'S SHORTEST FLIGHTS\n\nWestray to Papa Westray, Scotland (Loganair)\n\nDistance: 1.7 miles (2.7km)\n\nTime: 2 minutes\n\nCaye Chapel to Caye Caulker, Belize (Maya Island Air)\n\nDistance: 2.4 miles (3.9km)\n\nTime: 2 minutes\n\nMinami-Daito to Kita-Daito, Philippines (Ryukyu Air Commuter)\n\nDistance: 7 miles (11.3km)\n\nTime: 15 minutes\n\nHoolehua (Molokai Airport) to Kalaupapa, Hawaii (Pacific Wings)\n\nDistance: 8.8 miles (14.2km)\n\nTime: 10 minutes\n\nConnemara to Inishmann, Ireland (Aer Arann)\n\nDistance: 10.4 miles (16.7km)\n\nTime: 6 minutes\n\nIn March the record for the longest non-stop scheduled passenger flight from a UK airport was broken.\n\nQantas launched a direct service between London Heathrow and the Australian city of Perth, taking around 17 hours to cover 9,009 miles.\n\nThis is 24 per cent further than the UK's existing longest route, operated by Garuda Indonesia between the west London hub and Jakarta (7,275 miles).", "Singapore Airlines said it will relaunch the world's longest commercial flight in October, a journey of almost 19 hours from the city-state to New York, but it will not be available to economy travellers.\n\nThe daily non-stop journey from Changi to Newark Airport will cover about 16,700 kilometres (10,300 miles) and take about 18 hours 45 minutes, the airline said in a statement.\n\nThe current record holder is Qatar Airways Flight 921 from Auckland to Doha, which takes 17 hours 40 minutes.\n\nThe flight will use the long-range Airbus A350-900ULR, which will be configured to carry 67 in business class and 94 in premium economy\n\nThe Singapore Airlines flight will use the long-range Airbus A350-900ULR, which will be configured to carry 161 passengers - 67 in business class and 94 in premium economy.\n\nThe airline had flown a similar route from 2004 until 2013 but cancelled it as it fell short of revenue expectations.\n\nHowever, its latest decision comes as carriers look for new sources of revenue in a competitive environment, while long-haul flights often make more cash than those that require stops.\n\nChangi Airport, in Singapore (pictured), is one of the busiest - and best - airports in Southeast Asia\n\nThere are also plans for a non-stop route from Singapore to Los Angeles using the same plane, the airline said.\n\nThe new route comes as the city-state's flag carrier faces tough challenges.\n\nLast year, it consolidated its low-cost units TigerAir and Scoot into a single entity in a streamlining exercise.\n\nAnd this month it said it will absorb its struggling premium regional wing, SilkAir, into the broader group following a multi-million-dollar upgrade as part of reforms to stay competitive.", "Two weeks ago when David Davis exited the UK cabinet in protest at the so-called Chequers deal, the markets and sterling took a vaguely positive view of proceedings, strengthening on the notion that Theresa May was finally facing down the hardline Brexiteer faction in her government.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson, the most prominent Brexiteer, left 24 hours later, the markets didn't strengthen further but sank - the rationale being to lose one Brexiteer was good for a soft Brexit but to lose two was potentially fatal for the government trying to achieve a soft Brexit. Such was the nuanced reaction to the increasingly uncertain, complex and hard-to-fathom Brexit process.\n\nWhile Wednesday's slide - sterling fell 0.3 per cent against the euro to 89p in early trading - was linked to the Brexit logjam in the British parliament, the real momentum was created by weaker-than-expected UK inflation figures, which cast doubt over the expected Bank of England interest rate rise next month.\n\nIf anything, the markets have accommodated themselves to a certain degree of Brexit turmoil - not surprising given the current state of UK politics - and perhaps they're banking that somehow an orderly exit will be agreed even if the ride to that point will be torturous.\n\n\"The relatively confined degree of sterling volatility in recent weeks suggests that political uncertainty has chased many potential market players to the sidelines,\" Rabobank said.\n\nWhat's most surprising in the Brexit jigsaw, however, is the resilience of the UK economy, potentially the biggest fall guy, amidst a welter of warnings and threats from big industry players.\n\nUK employment rose to a record high in the three months to May, while wage growth is running ahead of inflation, meaning households are now enjoying a return to real spending power after a year-long pay squeeze. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research is also forecasting a pick-up in headline growth in the third quarter thanks to the perennially strong services sector. All of which is hard to square with the dark clouds that circle the economy and the threats to pull out from firms such as Airbus and Jaguar.", "Engine maker Rolls-Royce is the latest to announce its plans to develop a flying taxi - the aeronautical giant said that it has designed a propulsion system for a flying taxi which could take to the skies within the next few years.\n\nRolls joins a variety of other firms in seeking to develop flying vehicles.\n\nAirbus, US ride-sharing firm Uber and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk, have all announced projects.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce EVTOL (electric vertical take off and landing) plane will seat four or five people, with a flying range of 805km and a top speed of 320kmph.\n\nThe company said the initial concept for EVTOL uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity to power six electric propulsors and is specially designed to have a low noise profile.\n\nIts wings would be able to rotate 90 degrees, enabling the vehicle to take off or land vertically.

Johnson\n\nFARNBOROUGH, England, July 18 (Reuters) - Boeing Co struck a new deal for 100 passenger jets with Vietnamese budget airline VietJet Aviation JSC on Wednesday, deepening a battle for market share against rival Airbus in one of southeast Asia's hottest markets.\n\nBoeing and VietJet signed the provisional order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes worth almost $13 billion at list prices at the Farnborough Airshow in southern England.\n\nOf these, 80 are the recently launched 737 MAX 10 - the largest version of Boeing's best-selling 737 range - and 20 are the benchmark 737 MAX 8 model.\n\n\"The growth is incredibly strong in Southeast Asia,\" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister. \"VietJet is a major player there.\"\n\nThe draft deal comes two years after Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching an order for 100 737 MAX jets during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama.\n\nUntil then, VietJet had only ordered planes from Airbus, including a bumper order for 92 jets in December 2013.\n\nHowever, aircraft finance industry sources have expressed doubts over whether all the planes on order would be delivered on schedule amid a glut of airplane orders in the region.\n\nVietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao insisted on Wednesday the airline would use both the A320 and 737 aircraft in its fleet and would have \"no problem\" taking delivery.\n\nThe companies said VietJet, one of the fastest-growing carriers in southeast Asia, needed the planes to satisfy surging demand on high-dense domestic routes as well as popular routes throughout Asia.\n\nVietnam's first privately owned airline will become the largest MAX 10 customer in Asia once the deal is completed, with deliveries due in 2022-2025, the companies said. (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter)", "Single aisle dominated Day 3 on the Farnborough International Airshow.\n\nThe aerospace industry tends to be a relatively closed one, making it relatively difficult to analyze and understand. That comes on top of the complexity of the industry. For investors without in-depth knowledge, this makes the industry somewhat difficult to invest in, but there certainly are moments where the jet makers such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) become somewhat more transparent. This happens during the airshows when jet makers launch new products, give product presentations and make order announcements. The order announcements usually are a mix of customer reveals, new orders and orders pending finalization. So, via these airshows, you are given quite a nice insight into the sales pipeline.\n\nThe big airshows that often bring some big order news are the Paris Airshow, Farnborough International Airshow and the Dubai Airshow. The Paris Airshow and Farnborough Airshow are alternating events, and this year it is Farnborough Airport that will be the center of the commercial aircraft industry.\n\nAeroAnalysis will exclusively cover interesting news from the show and order announcements along with commentary on Seeking Alpha.\n\nIn this report we will cover events and order announcements for Day 3. For coverage on the previous days check out the links below:\n\nFarnborough Airshow Day 1: Boeing Bamboozling Everyone Farnborough Airshow Day 2: Small Jet Maker Shows Teeth Why tracking announcements is useful\n\nLooking at the order announcements, it is important to note the difference in the announcements. Orders can be divided into firm orders and LoI/MoUs (Letter of Intent/Memorandum of Understanding). A firm order subsequently can consist of a new order, firming up an earlier LoI/MoU, an order conversion or options. What we are mostly interested in are the new orders and firm-ups. LoI/MoUs are expression of intent to acquire a certain number of aircraft, possibly with options. Customers might also tentatively agree on converting part of its commitment to another aircraft type. The last category of announcements we have is the customer reveals. These do to add materially to the order book, but only classify unattributed orders to the customer.\n\nAbove, we briefly laid out the differences between the various types of announcements. Understanding the differences already helps readers a lot to determine whether the announcements are meaningful or not. Mainstream media has always lumped numbers regardless of announcement type creating a distorted picture. By splitting out these announcements, you get a much better feel of what might end up in the order book during a jet maker's next order book update, what is in the pipeline to materialize on the short to mid-term and what is really a 'might materialize one day' announcement. To those that already know where and how to make the splits properly, daily coverage might seem to be a bit too much but given that I write for a broad audience the majority does not make the split or does not have the time to make the split and that is why we launched the airshow coverages. We also have to add that even contributors on Seeking Alpha often don't know the differences and associate order inflow with a justified immediate positive impact on share prices or earnings. So there are many reasons to keep covering this subject and raise awareness instead of going with the euphoria. Some readers don't see the point in daily coverage. I can be brief about that: Daily coverage gives you the most complete coverage and since airshows can end with 1,000+ orders and commitments the last thing you'd want is to read a 30 page report on all 1,000+ commitments. After each day of the airshow comes to an end, we spend multiple hours filling in the tables, calculating and cross-checking before we publish a report on the daily order announcements. If we had to do it after the airshow, this would require us to spend over a week checking the numbers and verifying them plus several days writing and cutting the reports into readable pieces. By doing daily reports, we get the report to you hours after closing of the day instead of weeks after the airshow ended.\n\nSo, these are the reasons why we split announcement by types on each day. I hope you do understand the reasons for me to do it in this way. Any feedback you have on improving this coverage is appreciated.\n\nBoeing\n\nSeemingly, Boeing announced 193 orders and commitments worth almost $23.8 billion. For a balanced view we have to split between firm, LoIs/MoUs, customer reveals and account for options.\n\nOn the third day of the Farnborough International Airshow, Boeing announced no firm orders and all order announcement it did make for aircraft were order intentions:\n\nVietJet tentatively agreed on purchasing 80 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft and 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8s. An undisclosed customer tentatively agreed on purchasing 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10s. Boeing announced that three undisclosed airlines and lessors committed to purchasing 53 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nBoeing's also announced service agreements signed via its wholly owned subsidiary Aviall:\n\nUkraine's ANTONOV signed an agreement with Aviall, including an intent to support the production of their newest aircraft program, the AN-1X8. Aviall will manage supply chain procurement for ANTONOV production, including logistics and forward stocking concepts, helping to fulfill orders of this aircraft program and further aftermarket support. International WaterGuard signed a ten-year exclusive distribution agreement with Aviall for lavatory water heaters which fit Boeing 737, 747, 767 and 777 fleets. Canada-based IWG has been supplying potable water system components to the aircraft industry for over 30 years. Cargolux has signed an agreement for Aviall parts support. The arrangement allows Cargolux to continue operating its 747-400F fleet by meeting engine induction needs for up to 33 engine refurbishment shop visits through cost effective operations.\n\nOn the Day 3, Boeing's next generation single aisle product took the main stage with order intentions for 193 aircraft valued $23.75B at list prices. There was no order news on wide body jets or freighters that dominated the first 2 days.\n\nAirbus\n\nFor Airbus it was quite an interesting day, despite there being no big order avalanche. The Airbus A350 has been certified in China clearing the path for deliveries of Airbus's composite jet to China. Sticking to wide bodies, Airbus CCO, Eric Schulz expects to sell some Airbus A380s this year, which would be a positive for the struggling program. EasyJet took delivery of its first A321neo, but also said it is not interested in an upgraded variant of the aircraft or the Airbus A220.\n\nDuring the 3rd day, Airbus signed an agreement with Singapore's Defense Science and Technology Agency to develop 3D printing of spare parts for the Airbus A330 Multi-role Tanker Transport aircraft.\n\nAnother very interesting agreement was between Airbus and International SOS, the world's leading medical and security risk services company. The parties have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly study the viability of using aircraft or unmanned systems to deliver medical cargo and supplies.\n\nThere also was order inflow for Airbus:\n\nViva Aerobus firmed up an order for 25 Airbus A321neo aircraft and converted 16 existing orders for the Airbus A320neo to orders for the Airbus A321neo.\n\nCommitment:\n\nAn undisclosed customer signed a Memorandum of Understanding for 6 Airbus A330neo aircraft, the variant has not been specified. Uganda Airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding for 2 Airbus A330-800neo aircraft.\n\nFor Airbus, Day 3 of the airshow was not a spectacular one with a combined value of $5.8B. The repeat order and conversion from Viva Aerobus once again signaled the strength of the Airbus A321neo while the commitments for the Airbus A330neo are a positive. A side note for the Airbus A330neo is that the commitments come from an undisclosed customer and Uganda Airlines. Although we think the Airbus A330neo will have a bright future, at this point we would have liked to see some legacy or big lessors commit to the aircraft instead of some relatively unknown and undisclosed companies.\n\nSmaller jet makers\n\nSource: ATR\n\nOn day 3 the smaller jet makers had some announcements as well:\n\nUgandan National Airlines ordered 4 CRJ900s from Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRAF). Hokkaido Air System tentatively agreed on order 2 ATR42-600s with an option for 1 ATR42-600. Colombian EasyFly tentatively agreed on acquiring 2 ATR42-600s with options for 3 ATR72-600s. Conclusion Day 3 Farnborough International Airshow\n\nFigure 1: Infographic Farnborough International Airshow 2018 Day 3\n\nDay 3 was quite a tranquil one compared to the previous 2 days. Still, it has to be noted that the 3rd day usually is quite a slow one and compared to the 3rd day of the Paris Airshow and Farnborough International Airshow it was an above average day as far as I can recall. Boeing announced commitments for its single aisle product while Airbus had some important announcements for the Airbus A330neo.\n\nDuring the Paris Airshow of 2017, jet makers announced almost 1,500 orders, options, commitments and conversions and with one day left for the Farnborough Airshow jet makers already announced 1,335 orders, options, commitments and conversions.\n\nWith one day remaining, Boeing, Airbus and the smaller jet makers could actually make the 2018 airshow the best one in years. Boeing has been announcing a lot of business for its freighters as we anticipated and discussed with readers on the 20th of June, but the Boeing 787 and Boeing 777X have not yet seen big announcements during the show while Airbus has been able to announce some orders and commitments for the Airbus A350 but has yet to meet expectations with the Airbus A330neo. Before the airshow we highlighted some possible announcements, but so far very little has materialized. On Day 4, we hope to see Boeing and Airbus ending on a high note.\n\nWhile we do prepare these daily reports with the greatest care, it is possible that there might be some minor errors. When we detect an error, we will rectify as fast as possible and mention the changes made in the subsequent report.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, don't forget to hit the \"Follow\" button at the top of this page (below the article title) to receive updates for my upcoming articles.

Instead, he turned off the air-conditioning unit, causing a drop in the cabin's oxygen levels.\n\nEmergency measures were triggered, and oxygen masks dropped.\n\nThe plane was forced to descend rapidly.\n\nIf a plane loses cabin pressure, the pilot has to bring the aircraft to a lower altitude to keep crew and passengers safe.\n\nOnce the crew saw that the air conditioning had been turned off, they reactivated it and brought the flight back to its normal altitude.\n\nThe plane went on to complete its flight as scheduled, and none of the 153 passengers or crew were injured.\n\nA third pilot on board, who was not involved in the incident, had his licence revoked for six months and was banned by Air China for two years, the South China Morning post reported.\n\nChinese flight regulations prohibit all flight crew from smoking, and banned passengers from using e-cigarettes on board in 2006.\n\nAir China shares fell as much as 1.4 percent in Hong Kong in response to the safety crackdown, before recovering slightly, against a flat Hang Seng index.\n\nThe stock is down nearly 40 percent in Shanghai so far this year, amid a falling yuan and higher oil prices.\n\nBOCOM International analyst Geoffrey Cheng said the crackdown would likely have an impact on Air China's flight schedules, especially as it enters peak travel season, but could also prompt the airline to cut poorly performing routes.\n\n\"It could have pros and cons,\" he said.\n\nA Chinese aviation professor, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not permitted to speak to media, said the cuts appeared to only apply to Boeing 737 planes stationed at Air China's Beijing headquarters.\n\n\"For a big company like Air China they can move some 737s to their companies in southwest China or Zhejiang ... which could lessen Air China's losses,\" he said.\n\nAir China has several branch offices in places such as Inner Mongolia and Shanghai as well as number of subsidiary airlines.\n\nIt operated 269 Boeing 737s out of its 655-strong fleet at the end of December, according to its full-year report issued in March.

Numerous factors are at play when deciding when to reveal order plans, such as waiting for board or government approvals, they said.\n\nWinning the air show competition also has something to do with the sequence of announcements, two industry sources said. Airbus is behind Boeing in the race for orders this year.\n\nAIRASIA SUSPENSE\n\nAirbus listed orders for 80 A320neo narrowbody jets from an unidentified leasing company, another for 100 similar narrowbody aircraft, plus 14 large jets -- eight A350-900 and six A330neo.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that the first order for 80 aircraft came from China's ICBC Leasing.\n\nSeveral industry sources said the largest order for 100 jets had been placed by Dublin-based global leasing giant Avolon, owned by China's HNA Group.\n\nAn Avolon spokesman said: \"We are in constant dialogue with (manufacturers) and when we have an order to announce we will do that.\"\n\nAirbus is currently tackling payment delays from HNA Group which led to a backlog of undelivered wide-body A330 jets, first reported by Reuters last week.\n\nOne has been delivered and others are expected to follow.\n\nAvolon is owned by HNA vehicle Bohai Leasing and made changes in its bond structure earlier this year to insulate itself from the parent group's financial difficulties.\n\nAvolon CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this week those measures were working smoothly, but did not discuss order plans.\n\nPlanemakers often strike deals during the rest of the year with customers shy about disclosing their identity, especially in countries like China with complex approval processes.\n\nBut when opting to announce at an air show, buyers are usually keen to promote their plans and firms like Airbus and Boeing invest in lavish facilities with space for briefings.\n\nSome high-profile orders did get announced on Wednesday with Boeing bagging a provisional 100-plane order from budget carrier VietJet and Airbus confirming an order from Mexico's VivaAerobus after Reuters reported the two sides were negotiating a deal.\n\nMarket sources did not rule out a headline-grabbing finale.\n\nAirAsia boss Tony Fernandes has left Farnborough in suspense over whether he would fly in from Malaysia to confirm an order for Airbus A330neo planes or defect to the Boeing 787, though he said earlier this week he had \"no plans\" to make the trip.", "Get Business updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nThe giant Beluga XL is set to take-off today.\n\nThe 'whale in the sky' rolled out of the paint shop last month and is gearing up for its maiden flight this morning.\n\nAirbus said coverage of the take-off will start at 8.30am (UK time).\n\nIt is weather dependent but the forecast for Toulouse looks good.\n\nThe flight will kick off a 10-month flight test certification campaign leading to planned service entry in 2019.\n\nToday will just involve a short flight so there will be no flyover at Broughton.\n\nIt is hoped its test schedule will see it visiting Broughton in the coming months - once upgrade work is completed at the Flintshire runway to accommodate the plane.\n\nThe decision to build the BelugaXL was taken in November 2014 to address the transport and ramp-up capacity requirements for Airbus beyond 2019.\n\nThey are based on the A330-200 Freighter, with a large re-use of existing components and equipments.\n\nThere will be five put into service in the coming years, initially working alongside the current Beluga ST planes.\n\nThe Beluga XL has its enlarged fuselage \"bubble\" section that is six metres longer and one metre wider than on the Beluga ST.", "Aston Martin believes it could corner the market for luxury flying vehicles in the future.\n\nJames Bond would love it.

The tariffs mainly target production facilities, nuclear reactors and aircraft, instead of final consumer goods such as clothing and shoes. It seems that Ivanka's businesses were luckily unscathed in her father's willful trade friction with China.\n\nThe US to a large extent relies on China to make footwear and garments. According to the South China Morning Post, about one-third of the clothing and 72 percent of the shoes sold in the US are from China.\n\nIf Trump escalates trade frictions with China by raising tariffs on clothing and shoes, the most likely outcome is that most apparel brands will have to increase their selling prices in the US. The tariffs will ultimately be transferred to US consumers, making them the biggest victims of Trump's tariffs.\n\n\u00a9 Wikimedia Commons via Peter SchmidUS-China Trade War Causes Airbus to Conceal Clients' Identity - ReportsWe don't think Trump excluded clothing from the $34 billion tariff list because he wants to benefit his daughter's businesses amid the trade disputes. In a bid to prevent a large increase in the cost of living, it's understandable that Trump may try to avoid adding daily necessities to the list. Amid escalating trade tensions, a change in consumer prices will soon translate into political pressure on Washington.\n\nIvanka has a range of business interests in China, reportedly holding dozens of trademarks in the country.\n\nWhile China and the US are locked in a trade dispute, Ivanka's businesses in China will not become a target of revenge toward Trump's tariffs. On the other hand, China won't offer special favors to Ivanka's businesses in a bid to persuade her father to tone down the trade dispute.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS / Jason LeeChina Forces Yuan Lower Amid Trade Dispute With USThe Chinese government is likely to treat Ivanka's businesses and other US enterprises on an equal footing. The first daughter won't receive any special treatment from China.\n\nHopefully all garment producers can remain immune to the trade friction.\n\nBut if Trump wants to further escalate trade friction with China and drag his daughter's businesses into a trade war, we believe Ivanka will teach her father why a trade war would be a lose-lose situation for both sides.\n\nThis article was originally published in Global Times.", "Boeing announced three deals for wide-body freighters in the first two days of the 2018 Farnborough Airshow.\n\nOver the past few years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus have experienced a slump in wide-body orders, even as airlines have continued to buy narrow-bodies like the 737 and A320 at a frenetic pace. This downshift in order activity caused Boeing's backlog for models like the 747 and 777 to erode, forcing the aerospace giant to slash production of those models.\n\nDemand for passenger variants of the 747 and the current-generation 777 has slowed to a crawl. With fuel prices on the rise again, airlines are understandably tilting toward more fuel-efficient models, like Boeing's own 787 Dreamliner family.\n\nHowever, cargo airlines are starting to pick up the slack. At this week's Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced several orders for 747 and 777 freighters, helping it rebuild those aircraft families' order backlogs.\n\nPrior to 2017, the air cargo market was under pressure due to a combination of slow demand growth (driven by economic slowdowns in some key emerging markets) and excess capacity (driven by belly cargo space on passenger aircraft flying new long-haul routes).\n\nHowever, falling airfares and rising oil prices have caused global airlines to pull back on growth. Meanwhile, demand rebounded last year due to a strengthening global economy. Air cargo volume surged 9% in 2017, up from just 3.6% growth in 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\nThis improved supply-demand balance is finally driving a long-awaited recovery in the market for dedicated freighters. Boeing has been capitalizing on this rebound. For example, in the first half of 2018, it captured an order for 14 747-8Fs and four 767-300Fs from United Parcel Service and a deal for 12 767-300Fs and 12 777Fs from FedEx.\n\nDuring the first two days of the Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced three more freighter deals covering the 747-8F and 777F models. First, Qatar Airways firmed up an order for five 777Fs that had first been announced as a commitment a few months ago.\n\nSecond, Boeing announced a firm order and commitment from DHL for 14 777Fs, with purchase rights for another seven. The first four deliveries are scheduled for 2019. Boeing stated that it previously added some of these orders to its backlog without identifying the customer. (This likely refers to an order for 10 777Fs booked by Boeing last month and attributed to an unidentified customer.) The remaining firm orders will be added to the backlog at a later date.\n\nThird, Russian cargo specialist Volga-Dnepr Group confirmed an order for five 747-8Fs and signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 29 777Fs. If the latter deal is firmed up, it would be the largest order for current-generation 777s since 2011. That said, Volga-Dnepr announced a \"commitment\" for 20 747-8Fs in 2015 and an \"agreement\" for the same 20 aircraft in 2016, but most of those orders were never firmed up. Thus, it's wise to take the new LOI with a grain of salt.\n\nAs of the end of June, Boeing had 23 unfilled orders for 747s and 101 unfilled orders for current-generation 777s. The deals announced at Farnborough will add to those totals, ensuring that the 747 line will keep running well into the 2020s and protecting the 777 line from further cuts.\n\nBoeing still doesn't have enough 747 or 777 firm orders to contemplate returning to the higher production rates in place just a few years ago. But at least it's finally seeing some order momentum, which could pave the way for an eventual return to higher production of the 777 family -- if not the 747 -- a few years down the road.", "Taking the world of adventure yachting to new heights, one expedition vessel comes complete with two Airbus helicopters.\n\nThe 252-foot SeaXplorer 77, from Dutch ship builders Damen, has been commissioned by an unnamed client who has a passion for the outdoors and wants to use the choppers for heliskiing and touching down in remote places.\n\nExplaining the inspiration behind his luxury cruiser, the anonymous owner said: 'Some people think that fans of outdoor activities should stay in fleabag motels and dry their wet socks on radiators.\n\nTaking the world of adventure yachting to new heights, one expedition vessel comes complete with two Airbus helicopters\n\nThe 252-foot SeaXplorer 77, from Dutch builder Damen, has been commissioned by an unnamed client who has a passion for the outdoors and wants to use the choppers for heliskiing\n\n'I believe that you can combine the most active outdoor adventures and sports with ultimate comfort.'\n\nIn total, the SeaXplorer 77 will be able to hold 25 crew members and 12 passengers with six opulent suites.\n\nSo that guests can soak up the views, there are various panoramic lounges including a unique observation room at the bow.\n\nOther on board amenities will include jacuzzis, a spa and state-of-the-art gym.\n\nThere will also be a large room to store ski equipment, snowmobiles and other sporting gear.\n\nAfter working up an appetite on the slopes, guests can return to five-star cuisine rustled up in the spacious galley.\n\nMoving to the outside area, there will be a fully-certified landing deck for the helicopters and an enclosed hangar to protect them from the elements.\n\nIn total, the SeaXplorer 77 will be able to hold 25 crew members and 12 passengers with six opulent suites.

It could make its first flight in 2021, if production goes according to plan\n\nThe space agency is hoping to achieve a sonic boom 60 dBA lower than other supersonic aircraft, such as the Concorde, a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet that was operated until 2003.\n\nThe QueSST low-boom flight demonstrator (LBFD), or X-plane, aims to produce a much lower 'boom' than other supersonic aircraft at speeds beyond Mach 1.\n\nIt is designed to fly at Mach 1.4 (1,100mph / 1,700 kph), 55,000 feet (10 miles) above the ground.\n\nThe aircraft is shaped to separate the shocks and expansions associated with supersonic flight to reduce the volume of the shaped signature, and was developed by Lockheed's Skunk Works over 20 years.\n\nLockheed Martin has been working on the preliminary design, with hopes to move on to build the demonstrator, but NASA also opened the door for other companies to submit their own designs as well\n\nWHAT WAS CONCORDE?\n\nConcorde was a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet that was operated until 2003.\n\nIt had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2.04 (1,354mph or 2,180k per hour at cruise altitude) and could seat 92 to 128 passengers.\n\nIt was first flown in 1969, but needed further tests to establish it as viable as a commercial aircraft.\n\nConcorde was a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet that was operated until 2003.

Johnson", "Airbus SE and Thales SA expect the number of cockpit crew on long-haul flights, typically three or four, could be reduced to two from the year 2023.\n\nFARNBOROUGH/SINGAPORE: Airplane manufacturers are working to adapt jets to reduce the number of pilots needed for long-haul flights and to build new cockpits designed for a single aviator in order to ease a global pilot shortage and cut airline costs.\n\nAirbus SE and Thales SA expect the number of cockpit crew on long-haul flights, typically three or four, could be reduced to two from 2023 thanks to new technology to reduce pilot workload.\n\n\"That's not an absurd date. Reducing crew on long-range looks to be the most accessible step because there is another pilot onboard,\" Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus head of engineering, told Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow.\n\nBoeing Co is examining the possibility of having reduced manning in the cockpit of a proposed mid-sized jet that it aims to have in service by 2025 if it proceeds with a launch decision next year, according to UBS analysts. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"You can see the drivers from both angles,\" said Graham Braithwaite, Director of Transport Systems at Britain's Cranfield University. \"The technology to fly an aircraft on automatic is brilliant. The other driver in all this is that we're really short of pilots. They're a very expensive resource.\"\n\nThe proponents of reduced numbers in the cockpit saying the move, which could begin with cargo flights, is inevitable, just as pilot numbers were cut from three to two in the 1980s when the flight engineer position was axed due to improved design on new jets like the Boeing 757.\n\nAirlines globally could save around US$15 billion a year by going down to a single pilot, UBS said, and at a time of a pilot shortage, this would help ensure there are enough aviators to serve a fast-growing industry.\n\nReplacing the vast array of knobs and switches with more digital interfaces familiar to today's teenagers could also help to shorten the amount of time it takes to train pilots, thus easing the shortage.\n\nUltimately, the goal would be for a fully autonomous commercial jet along the lines of a driverless car, although that technology, which requires clean-sheet jet designs from the major manufacturers, could take until 2040, according to an estimate from Thales.\n\n\"I would compare autonomy to an open-heart surgery of our systems. All of our systems are specified to have permanently two persons in the cockpit,\" Airbus' Dumont said.\n\nCritics, however, say there are good safety reasons for having more than two pilots in the cockpit on long-haul flights and at least two on shorter journeys, with the costs outweighed by the benefits.\n\nIncreased vulnerability\n\nFor example, reducing cockpit numbers to one in the cruise phase of a long-haul flight could increase fatigue and vulnerability in the event of an unexpected in-flight incident while the other pilot is resting, said three pilots who spoke to Reuters, pointing to the Air France 447 crash in 2009.\n\nEven with three pilots on board, the A330 was not recovered from a high altitude stall. In that case, the two more junior aviators were at the controls and the captain, once retrieved from resting, was unable to intervene in time to save the plane.\n\n\"I have experienced the simulation of what they went through and, even being aware that it is about to happen, it is very disconcerting,\" said Murray Butt, the president of the Qantas pilots union. \"I can't imagine what it would be like for two low-time pilots in the middle of the night.\"\n\nOther concerning scenarios include the deliberate crash of a Germanwings jet by one of its pilots in 2015 and the risk of a single pilot suffering from an in-flight health problem.\n\nMoving to a single pilot would also create training difficulties, said Stuart Beveridge, an Australian commercial pilot and aviation researcher, because the first officer role is considered an apprentice step before taking on the responsibilities of a captain.\n\nThe financial benefits of reducing crew numbers could also be marginal, said aviation consultant James Halstead, because airline cost savings would likely be passed through to passengers in the form of lower ticket prices.\n\n\"On long-haul, crewing is a tiny proportion of the cost, compared to the fuel and the capital cost of the equipment,\" he added. \"It outweighs paying the salary of one pilot.\"\n\nThe flying public also has concerns; a UBS poll found only 13% of respondents would take a jet with a single pilot.\n\nForging ahead\n\nRegardless of the concerns, manufacturers are pushing ahead with projects like embedding artificial intelligence into cockpits and connectivity that allows for decision-making on the ground.\n\nIn an industry where safety is paramount, reducing cockpit crew numbers won't occur without significant testing and certification from regulators, though.\n\nIn addition, getting airlines to spend money to retrofit their current fleet as well as a cultural change to manage the new kind of pilot role will be crucial, said Christine Ourmieres-Widener, CEO of British regional car Flybe.\n\n\"Most of the time people who are selling solutions don't realise how complex it can be to manage change and that's a massive change,\" she said. \"The technology will definitely be ready at some point but it will be a long process.\"\n\nWhether future jets will be designed for a single pilot has yet to be decided, the manufacturers said, with Airbus highlighting that new propulsion technologies also need to be considered.\n\n\"I would add that the single pilot operation is not an absolute must,\" Dumont said.\n\n\"But it may be made a necessity by the fact there is a disconnect between the number of aircraft and the number of pilots.\""]}, "Bayer": {"2018-07-19": ["Thursday's Man Utd transfer rumours: Robert Lewandowski, Thiago Alcantara, Toby Alderweireld and Leonardo Bonucci\n\nLast Updated: 19/07/18 9:02am\n\nJose Mourinho targets two Bayern Munich stars as we round up the latest transfer rumours on Thursday, July 19.\n\nThe Manchester United manager is plotting a swoop for Bayern pair Robert Lewandowski and Thiago Alcantara, according to reports in the Sun.\n\nIt is believed that the Bundesliga champions would be prepared to offload the duo if a club met their valuation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Portuguese is also thought to still be interested in bringing unsettled Tottenham Hotspur centre-back Toby Alderweireld to Old Trafford next season, reports the Independent.\n\nNegotiations for the Belgium international recently came to an end with United being priced out of a move for the player by the north London club.\n\nHowever, the Red Devils are now confident an agreement can be reached for Alderweireld.\n\nElsewhere, United are just one of a number of big-name European clubs who are pondering a move for AC Milan defender Leonardo Bonucci, says the Daily Express.\n\nThe Italian, 31, only moved to San Siro from Juventus last July.\n\nFantasy Football is back!\n\nFantasy just got real.

Even ones, it seems, that didn't go to Russia and conquer the world. Kingsley Coman, a man with a name that belongs on Game of Thrones, is in Arsenal's crosshairs, with Unai Emery intent on bringing some pace to the flanks to make up for the fact that he signed Stephan Lichtsteiner. The Bayern Munich winger won't come cheap though, with reports of a \u00a344m price asking price being bandied around.\n\nMonaco are trying to snaffle Aleksandr Golovin from under Chelsea's nose by sending their chief Russian suit, Vadim Vasilyev - the man responsible for finding former Rumour Mill favourite Thomas Lemar - to vodka and dine his CSKA Moscow counterpart. \"When we receive an offer, we always try to negotiate openly,\" said CSKA's president, Yevgeny Giner. \"Indeed, we were visited by the vice-president of Monaco and made a proposal for Golovin. Chelsea? We have no secret agreement with them. The question of his transition to another club will be decided, I think, in the next couple of days.\"\n\nThe biggest loser from Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival in Turin - it still feels weird typing that - seems to be Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, who suddenly finds himself second, maybe even third, choice at Juventus. Chelsea's new manager, Maurizio Sarri, who apparently feels underwhelmed by \u00c1lvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud's pivotal role for France at the World Cup, wants to be reunited with the Argentinian, who scored 36 goals for Napoli under Sarri in 2015-16 - nobody has ever scored more goals in a single Serie A season.\n\nSpeaking of the Naples club, the new big cheese there, Carlo Ancelotti, is keen on taking Michy Batshuayi, another striker set to be cast away from Stamford Bridge.\n\nSpurs have been awfully quiet on the transfer front this summer, but with Aston Villa strapped for cash, they are reportedly in talks with the Championship club for Jack Grealish, with figures wildly varying between \u00a330m-\u00a340m. \"We're up against it, let's be open and honest, we might have to make decisions that might not be easy, we have to generate some money,\" Villa manager Steve Bruce admitted earlier this month. \"Inevitably that is going to be player sales. There are going to be people that I do not want to sell - and the obvious one is Jack.\"\n\nManchester City's 'Media Watch', their own daily gossip column published on their official website, in which they seemingly cherry pick the rumours they like the most, is leading with a move for Juventus' Miralem Pjanic, and also mentions Real Madrid's Mateo Kovacic and Roma's Cengiz \u00dcnder.\n\nKasey Keller, Brad Friedel, J\u00fcrgen Sommer, Tim Howard, Brad Guzan, Marcus Hahnemann: English football has a rich history of American goalkeepers but for the first time in two decades last season there were no US stoppers in the top two divisions. Bristol City are trying to change that by wafting \u00a33m in front of Columbus Crew's Zack Steffen.", "The International Champions Cup has been on a mission to change summer warm-ups tournaments into something worth playing for\n\nCharlie Stillitano knows exactly when everything fell into place. \"I sat down with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2003 and he said. 'I want to play really hard games,'\" the New Yorker, who appears to be friends with every football A-lister, tells the Guardian. \"Jos\u00e9 was the first person to not just embrace it, but demand it. Sir Alex Ferguson later wrote he learned something from Jos\u00e9 about getting ready to start the season. It was like total stamp-endorsing.\"\n\nMemories of this summer's World Cup remain fresh in the minds of fans, yet the modern football juggernaut waits for no one. This week sees the good and the great from Europe -- Manchester United, Manchester City, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Real Madrid, Liverpool and both Milan clubs among others -- begin their pre-season preparations in earnest as the International Champions Cup (ICC) rolls around once again. A sauntering summer kick-about this is not - the tournament involves 18 teams, 27 matches, three continents, and 22 cities in eight countries.\n\nStillitano, executive chairman of Relevent Sports, the company behind the ICC, says this year's incarnation is more inclusive than ever before. For the first time, a four-team women's tournament is on the schedule, alongside a new under-14 futures competition, which is being trumpeted as football's version of the Little League World Series.\n\nStillitano believes the quality of teams in the ICC means the days of the bigs guns from the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, and Serie A reluctantly hopping on a plane, kicking a ball around, and smiling through gritted teeth at the opening of a new gas station, are gone.\n\n\"I went with Manchester United to Singapore in 2001, just to get a feel for things as we were bringing them over in future years,\" he says. \"They played a Singapore XI. Fabien Barthez played striker, and it was all the Manchester United fans laughing and joking, even the board members.\n\n\"It was more like the celebration of Man Unitedness. And, then I remember in 2002 was the first game we ever did. Real Madrid versus Roma. Fabio Capello was the manager of Roma and everyone thought we were going to do terribly. They said a club match wouldn't sell, but Giants Stadium sold out.\n\n\"An English-American journalist stood up and said, 'I don't understand what the big deal is here. It's just a friendly.' Capello was having none of it. 'Do you see who is here? Zidane, Figo, Totti, Roberto Carlos, Cafu, Panucci. You think they want to lose to each other tomorrow?'\n\n\"That stuck with me. If you can get them out in the field together, they'll fight. Of course, it's still pre-season. Players won't be going all-out for 90 minutes.\"\n\nPurely from a North American viewpoint, the ICC helps football's profile in the summer - particularly when the likes of the NFL and NBA are in their off-season and fans look to other forms of entertainment. Last summer saw three of the most attended football matches in US history - 93,098 for Real versus Manchester City in Los Angeles, 82,104 for Barcelona's clash with Juventus in New Jersey, and 80,162 for Barca and Manchester United. The crowds will flock once again this year - Manchester United's meeting with Liverpool at Michigan's 107,000-capacity Big House could break records - and the ripple effect is clear.\n\nRelevent have recently purchased football marketer BRC Group, allowing them to take control of FC Alianza, the largest and most prestigious amateur Hispanic football program in the US. The Futures tournament, meanwhile, includes eight state and eight MLS development teams, as well as Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, Celtic and Bayern Munich.\n\n\"The future of the sport depends on finding, training, and encouraging emerging players,\" says Stillitano.\n\nHowever, the ICC's two-week spell cuts right across MLS and eats into fans' attention - as well as the revenue streams. The market isn't that big, after all. So, is there any friction? \"We have an open dialogue and a good partnership with MLS,\" says the Relevent Sports CEO, Daniel Sillman.\n\nEvents in Russia mean many top players will be taking a breather, while their teammates return to work, but matches like Real Madrid v Manchester United in Miami on 31 July have been placed near the end of the schedule to ensure some stardust will be sprinkled at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\n\"We know it's not the Premier League, La Liga, or the Champions League,\" says Stillitano. \"We're not trying to pretend differently, but it's a serious tournament all the big teams want to be in to prepare the proper way.\"\n\nOn a more personal level, Stillitano says the tournament has helped shift his own perceptions.\n\n\"I'm an AC Milan fan, so when I was dealing with someone like Marco Materazzi at Inter, I would always think what a knucklehead this guy is,\" he says with a smile. \"But you meet him and he's the sweetest guy in the world.\n\n\"He would take a tray from the Four Seasons hotel in Philadelphia every day filled with food and take it out to the homeless people on his own. No one told him to do it. You see that and I can't hate these guys anymore. It's all about making everyone happy - and I think we're doing just that.\"", "Stay with Sportsmail for all the transfer latest news and updates, as it happens\n\nWith the Premier League season now wrapped up and finalised, all eyes begin turning to summer recruitment and the opening of the transfer window.\n\nThe merry-go-round of deals is soon set to spring into life, with clubs eager to conclude business before the World Cup comes into play.\n\nJoin Sportsmail's DAN RIPLEY for all the latest news from the top flight and beyond as the likes of Manchester City, United and Chelsea look to get out the chequebooks early and get a march on their rivals.\n\nIf you are using the app, please click here to view today's live blog\n\nDan Ripley\n\nHost commentator\n\nAuto-update 17:07 That wraps up the transfer news for one day...\n\nBut be sure to check back tomorrow for the latest updates throughout the day...\n\n17:06 Thomas Tuchel confirmed as new manager of Paris Saint Germain on a two-year deal as former Borussia Dortmund boss promises 'success at the highest international level'\n\nThomas Tuchel has been named as the new manager of Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain, replacing Unai Emery.\n\nTuchel, who has been out of work since leaving Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2017, has been one of Europe's most in-demand coaches.\n\nRead more here\n\n16:43 Erm....

Even his staunchest defenders may have been put off by his lengthy run-up, though.\n\nBut Luiz smashed the ball into Manuel Neuer's top corner to leave the world's best goalkeeper with no chance before goading the Bayern fans behind the goal. It gave Chelsea the platform for their greatest-ever triumph at the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe Brazilian defender helped Chelsea secure a memorable Champions League triumph\n\nLuiz smashed the ball into Bayern Munich star Manuel Neuer's top corner in the shootout\n\nHaving a laugh at Sir Alex's expense\n\nSir Alex Ferguson was left deeply unimpressed when Luiz went down 'like a dying swan' to earn Rafael a red card as Chelsea saw out a win away at Manchester United.\n\nTo make things worse, Luiz, grounded at a corner flag by the Stretford End was caught on camera laughing at the outrage of the United fans in front of him.\n\n'That is bad,' Ferguson said. 'What kind of professional is that?'\n\nThe legendary manager might have questioned the whacky defender's motives but that was all part of Luiz's flamboyant character -- although it was not taken too well on this occasion.\n\nThe former PSG star laughs at the Manchester United fans during a match at Old Trafford\n\nPremier League's introduction to Luiz's wild world\n\nArriving in the same transfer window as \u00a350million Fernando Torres, Luiz's switch from Benfica went somewhat under the radar but he quickly made himself known with some early performances.\n\nAway at Fulham, he made a full debut and looked a powerful and proactive defender before conceding a late penalty.\n\nAgainst Manchester United at Stamford Bridge a fortnight later, he netted his first goal with a superb half-volley to inspire a turnaround that looked well in doubt with Torres toothless upfront.\n\nAgainst United at Stamford Bridge, he netted his first goal with a superb half-volley\n\nThirty-five yard screamer at Craven Cottage\n\nBack at the ground where he made his Jekyll-and-Hyde full debut, Luiz perfectly exhibited his eye for the spectacular with a fantastic long-range strike against Fulham.\n\nPicking the ball up 35 yards out, and with nobody making an effort to close him down, the former Benfica star took a touch before unleashing a screamer into the top left-hand corner with his right foot.\n\nIt was the furthest out a goal had been scored from in the 2012-13 season although the celebration was -- for once -- surprisingly understated.\n\nThe Brazil international is mobbed by his Blues team-mates after scoring against Fulham\n\nEuropa League brilliance in Basle\n\nSome of Luiz's best moments in a Chelsea shirt came on their run to the Europa League final in 2013 and none more so than in the semi-final away at Basle.\n\nThen aged 26, he was becoming an increasingly key player under Rafa Benitez in a regular midfield role while also being trusted to take set-pieces.\n\nIn the first leg at St Jakob-Park, Chelsea had surrendered a lead before Luiz stepped up to fire in from distance at a free-kick to put them on their way to the Amsterdam final.\n\nFunnily enough, Basle could have argued that Luiz shouldn't have even been on the pitch after he clattered Philipp Degen on the shin with a challenge that was deemed worthy of only a yellow card.\n\nLuiz scores a long-distance free-kick for Chelsea in the Europa League semi-final first leg\n\nThe '10-year-old on a PlayStation'\n\nWhen Chelsea were beaten at home by Liverpool in Luiz's first full season in England, his performance was picked up by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville as an example of exactly what not to do at centre back.\n\n'Whenever I watch him play, to me David Luiz looks like he's being controlled by a 10-year-old in the crowd on a PlayStation,' Neville said.\n\nHis comments would prove a sticking point with then-Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas while Luiz took the more playful approach of posting: 'Gary Neville I love u', on Twitter.\n\nLiverpool players celebrate at Stamford Bridge as Luiz endured a nightmare match for Chelsea\n\nA grovelling apology\n\nThe dangerous side of Luiz's rough-and-tumble style came out as a cynical shoulder charge on Brentford's Jake Reeves left his opponent concussed in an FA Cup replay.\n\nHe escaped with just a yellow card but made up for his actions to an extent with a post-match visit to the visitors' dressing room at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThen-Brentford manager Uwe Rosler said: 'The player came into our dressing room and spoke to Jake.

Not from his car, or his flights home -- although he does worry about that -- but pollution as a metaphor for the negativity that surrounds modern life.\n\nLuiz, obviously, isn't the average footballer. For a start, he uses metaphors.\n\nHe also isn't average because of the way he looks, the way he plays, and the glow he exudes as he does. Luiz enjoys himself. Luiz enjoys football. He is not afraid to show it, either.\n\nChelsea defender David Luiz has been a revelation in his second spell with the top-flight club\n\nLuiz returned to Stamford Bridge last summer after a two-year period with Paris Saint-Germain\n\nDAVID LUIZ'S CAREER\n\n2006-2007: Vitoria\n\n2007: Benfica (loan)\n\n2007-2011: Benfica\n\n2011-2014: Chelsea\n\n2014-2016: Paris Saint-Germain\n\n2016- Chelsea\n\nIn a world of scowls and poses, there is true delight in Luiz's game, giant, toothy smiles that are its by- product. Luiz is one of those people who, if someone pokes a camera at him, can't resist sticking his tongue out, or pulling a face.\n\nAnd for this reason, and perhaps some severe assessments of his first time in England, he is not taken as seriously as he should be, as a player.\n\nAt 30, with more than 500 appearances in club and international football, and on the brink of adding the Premier League title to the five he has won across Brazil, Portugal and France -- plus the Champions League with Chelsea -- that might be about to change.\n\nN'Golo Kante has cleaned up the individual awards, Eden Hazard is the aesthetes' choice, but it is Luiz at the back who has transformed Chelsea's season. The club took its first step towards a title that will be confirmed with victory at West Bromwich Albion on Friday night, when Antonio Conte switched to his favoured back three after a run of two defeats and a draw. Luiz's presence made that work.\n\nJohn Terry is his understudy, but Terry could not have sustained this position through the season. Luiz has made it his own. He has refined his game, played with discipline and awareness, shown all of the control it was previously claimed he did not possess. And he has done this with joy. More than any Premier League player, Luiz adds to the gaiety of nations.\n\nHe is someone who, if someone pokes a camera at him, can't resist sticking his tongue out\n\nThe Brazilian is on the brink of winning the Premier League title for the first time in his career\n\nI make a mistake. It does not mean I am a bad person\n\n'I think many people enjoy playing football, but they don't want to show that,' he says. 'I'm like this because I remember when I was trying to be like this. I'm like this because I remember when this was my dream.\n\n'I used to joke with my sister, pretending to sign my autograph. \"Oh this one is nice, this one is nice.\" Now I stop the car and people hand me pieces of paper, or they want a photograph. There will be a kid at the training ground, he has one leg. He is talking about playing football, with a big smile, telling me about a goal he scored and I think, \"Why am I tired? What is my problem?\"\n\n'I think everybody is born pure. You never go to the maternity ward and hold a baby that has bad energy. It's impossible. But after comes the pollution of the world, and that makes people change. The situations, the moments in their life, people do bad things not because they are bad but because they don't have the right support at the right moment.\n\n'If you let the pollution take you, then you start to complain for nothing, for anything. You have to push away the pollution, the negative minds, the negative lies. If you gathered 100 people and asked if they had a problem, you would get told about 100 problems. But if you took one person and showed him all the other people's problems, he would think, \"I haven't got a problem\". This is the world.\n\n'They teach us to be negative, to complain about nothing. I'm not like this every day. But when I am I think, \"Hey, wake up\". I start to clean myself, get rid of the pollution. Try to do the right thing. Do I make mistakes? Yes. I go to hospitals, I see people in the beds, I think, \"They are better than me\". I am feeling pain for nothing. Why?\n\nLuiz points to the sky as he makes way out on to the pitch for recent clash with Middlesbrough\n\nJohn Terry is his understudy, but Terry could not have sustained this position through the year\n\nLUIZ HONOURS\n\nVITORIA\n\nCampeonato Baiano: 2005, 2007\n\nBENFICA\n\nPrimeira Liga: 2009-10\n\nPortuguese League Cup: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11\n\nCHELSEA\n\nFA Cup: 2011-12\n\nUEFA Champions League: 2011-12\n\nUEFA Europa League: 2012-13\n\nPARIS SAINT-GERMAIN\n\nLigue 1: 2014-15, 2015-16\n\nFrench Cup: 2014-15, 2015-16\n\nFrench League Cup: 2014-15, 2015-16\n\nFrench Super Cup: 2014, 2015, 2016\n\nBRAZIL (INTERNATIONAL)\n\nFIFA Confederations Cup: 2013\n\nSuperclasico de las Americas: 2014\n\n'But joy is important in life, not just football. Joy is being serious and professional, too. Joy can be reaching your potential by training hard and being disciplined. Joy can be following the rules you need to follow.\n\n'People have the job to judge the footballer. They must have an opinion. That's normal. What is not nice is when they think they know. To say \"He played bad\" is different from \"He is a bad player\". You understand? I make a mistake. It does not mean I am a bad person.\n\n'Some people have the pollution and they attack in a negative way. The judges can become crazy, too. In the past people have said I am not focused. It is not nice when you don't have that respect.'\n\nThis is what Luiz has been striving for, throughout his career. Respect. The 'PlayStation footballer' criticism that Gary Neville made early in his career wounded him more than is realised. Even now, he doesn't like to be reminded of it, doesn't understand why it is brought up so frequently, when even Neville has said his view has changed.\n\nYet Neville was not alone. It was said one of the reasons Jose Mourinho allowed Luiz to be sold to Paris Saint-Germain in 2014 was his optimism. As a defender, not a person; Mourinho likes his defenders pessimistic. He wants them worried about what will go wrong, not confident the plan will succeed.\n\nLuiz scored one of the goals of the season when his free-kick caught Liverpool off guard\n\nThe centre back slides on his knees in celebration following his stunning goal at Anfield\n\n'Hey, that is not just Mourinho,' Luiz interjects. 'In Brazil they say it, too. Defenders must be pessimists. I cannot be that. I am an optimist in my life. I'm positive. I always think and dream of the best things. But I know where I am. I don't want to take my small boat and go against a wave of 20 metres. Maybe I can go around the sides, and we'll arrive. I'll try to find a way.'\n\nAn instance of extreme optimism, though, produced one of the goals of the season. January 31, Chelsea at Liverpool. Adam Lallana fouls Hazard some 25 yards from goal. Luiz is told he can take the free-kick. But he is carrying an injury. He goes to the touchline for water instead. As he runs back on, Mark Clattenburg blows his whistle.\n\nBy now Luiz is striding full pelt towards the scene. Willian is supposed to take it, but senses what Luiz has in mind, and says, 'Go on, go on.' And while Simon Mignolet is back on his heels, and Liverpool are still organising their puny three-man wall, Luiz sends the ball into the top corner off the inside of the right post.\n\nJurgen Klopp called it world class. 'Two seconds before he was standing next to me, drinking water and talking to Antonio Conte,' he marvelled.\n\nThe 30-year-old spoke to Sportsmail's chief sports writer Martin Samuel at Cobham\n\nHe says: 'In Brazil they say defenders must be pessimists but I am an optimist. I'm positive'\n\nEveryone thought Conte was crazy when I came back\n\nI tell Luiz it is probably my favourite goal of the season. He wonders why.\n\n'Because it's one guy thinking differently from everybody else on the field.'\n\n'Like Hazard does every game,' he says.\n\n'No, because he is thinking instinctively. This was intellectual.'\n\nFinally, he accepts the compliment. 'No, I understand,' he concedes. 'I like this kind of stuff, too. Also, I take the risk. If it goes 20 metres over, everybody will be, \"What's he doing? He didn't put his body in the best way. He was greedy. He's crazy.\"\n\n'I'm not saying I'm cleverer than everybody but when the referee blows the whistle all the players take a big breath to prepare, and in that moment they are not ready. I know this, because I will do it too. The Liverpool goalkeeper is one of the best in the world. If you give him time he will do much better. So I waited for that breath.'\n\nThe Brazilian enjoyed a successful spell in France with PSG - pictured playing against Chelsea\n\nThe defender looks to tackle Luis Suarez during a Champions League quarter-final tie in 2015\n\nHe is a bright guy, Luiz, but not through formal education. He speaks English and French, as well as Spanish and Portuguese, and can get by in Italian and, often, language skills are learned at home. Yet Luiz didn't speak any language except his own when he came to England in 2011.\n\nHe worked hard at his classes here because he wanted to communicate with people. He still does. Kante, Chelsea's player of the season, is very quiet and speaks French.\n\nStaff say it is Luiz who has brought him out of his shell, brought him into the group, used his French to communicate and create team spirit where previously -- well, we all know what happened last season.\n\nPeople and relationships are important to Luiz. 'Trophies are nice, titles are nice, shining your armour is nice,' he says, 'but moments with people are special.\n\n'Maybe we will meet again in a couple of months; maybe never more. So this is our moment, because we do not know what happens from here. I try to keep the people who touch my heart in my life -- friends, parents. I have two friends who live with me, my girlfriend lives near, my parents come over a lot, on my birthday it was my sister and her kids.\n\nLuiz and Fernando Torres celebrate Chelsea's historic Champions League triumph in 2012\n\nLuiz climbs onto the crossbar to pose for this famous picture following win over Bayern Munich\n\nLUIZ'S 2016-17 STATS\n\nAppearances: 31\n\nMinutes played: 2776\n\nGoals: 1\n\nSuccessful passes: 1228\n\nPassing accuracy: 83.14 per cent\n\nRecoveries: 181\n\nClearances: 159\n\nHeaded clearances: 94\n\n'I remember the first time I said a bad word in front of my sister. My dad sat me down at the table. I had a different attitude then, not the right attitude. \"What do you want for your life?\" he asked. I said I wanted to play football. \"No,\" he said. \"First you must become a good human. I want you to become a footballer, too. But first you must be a good human, with honesty, character, dignity.\" It was a difficult conversation, but it changed my life.\n\n'My examples were my parents. They were not my friends like this new generation. If your mum and dad are your friends, the bad things you do with your friends you will do with your mum and dad.\n\n'They were the people I listened to, who had their feet on the ground, were humble, who had a simple life. My life has changed a lot, but sometimes I stop and I look to my mum and dad and they're still the same people.\n\n'It was my dad's dream to become a top professional. He got to the brink of the first team at Atletico Mineiro but the money was not there, so he had to take another job. He used to say to me, 'This is for you, it was not for me. I will live this with you.'\n\nLuiz opened up on growing up in Brazil and how he has grown as a person while in England\n\nThe defender was speaking at his side's training base ahead of their clash with West Brom\n\n'I was training with Sao Paulo which was a long way from where we lived and I didn't get home until 4pm. When my dad thought I could succeed he went to the court and got authorisation that I study at night school. That was my first shock because it was for older people who didn't have the chance to study -- but I was 12. So all my school friends were 25, 35 -- one was a woman of 65.\n\n'It was great to see how she still wanted to learn. I used to help her. But I started to learn and know things, that were not for my age. There were drugs around, guns around -- I think football saved me many times. People might say, \"No, he's not part of that life. He's our footballer.\" And they would leave me alone.'\n\nRejected by Sao Paulo, Luiz tried out for America Mineiro -- 'the only time in my life I knew hunger, I ate beans in a liquefier twice a day for 10 days, they wanted me to sign but I didn't go back' -- and was then invited for a trial at Vitoria in Salvador, 1,260 miles away. He was 14.\n\n'I asked my mum to pay for the flight,' he recalls. 'It was too far by bus. We had to pay in instalments because only rich people flew. I was playing No 10, and on the bench. We used three defenders, nice, like Chelsea.\n\n'We were going to this competition in Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul -- it was 75 hours by bus from Salvador. Two of our defenders got injured on the journey but our coach did not want to change the system because our wing-backs were the best players in the team.\n\nDuring his first Chelsea spell, Luiz was part of the team which lifted the 2013 Europa League\n\nThe Chelsea team celebrate from an open top bus following CL and FA Cup triumphs in 2012\n\nMourinho says defenders must be pessimists but I can't be\n\n'We had one spare defender. \"Who else can I play?\" he asked. I told him, \"Me.\" He said, \"But you've never been a defender.\" I told him, \"Now I am.\" He trained two days with me in the middle, I played and was voted best defender in the competition.\n\n'I returned to Salvador a defender. That was a year before I became professional. You cannot make your opportunity happen, you have to see it when it comes. I took a risk and it changed my life, it changed my family's life. Sometimes people lose opportunity because they don't want to try, they don't see the possibility.'\n\nIt could be another of those metaphors, perhaps for Chelsea's season, or for Luiz's decision to return to London. How often does second time around work in football?\n\nYet Luiz has been a revelation. Conte is getting the credit, and no doubt his attention to detail is a big factor, but Luiz has grown, too. He has learned to temper his game, that he can have greater impact playing with more patience, even restraint. And, being Luiz, he refuses to separate personal and professional growth.\n\nLuiz scored this spectacular and decisive free-kick in Brazil's 2014 World Cup quarter-final win\n\nThe centre back and Brazil team-mates were embarrassed when Germany won semi-final 7-1\n\n'Maybe the team is more tactically disciplined,' he adds. 'What I know is I am a better player, a better person, a better brother, a better boyfriend, for sure. I know more things, I have more experience. If my friend came to me crying I know what to say to him, or whether to say nothing at all and just hug him.\n\n'It's like football, I know things a bit more now. I think in a different way. I love our system. It has helped so many players. But, don't forget, we had also lost games.\n\n'If the manager had started the season playing Victor Moses at right wing-back, everyone would have said, \"He's crazy -- go back to Italy.\" But with the right circumstances, he's had an amazing season.\n\n'Everyone thought he was crazy when I came back, too. But I know my role. Cover everybody, cover the space. It is not the best position for me with the ball. Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta touch the ball more than me, because all the strikers stay with me.\n\nHe got his first taste of football in Europe when he joined Benfica, initially on loan, in 2007\n\nAfter three seasons in Portugal with Benfica, the Brazilian star first signed for Chelsea in 2011\n\nThe strikers are making it boring for me in England!\n\n'They want to make it boring for me in England, because everybody knows I love to play. But I know more about football now. I know why people play good, why people play bad and I have to play for my team.\n\n'Before maybe I got frustrated if my team was not controlling the offensive side, and I would lose my position. I would try to do it myself, which was part of the plan in Benfica. My job was to drive the ball to the halfway line. Chelsea didn't have that plan, but sometimes I would do it anyway.\n\n'I like defenders who are always looking to transform a defensive ball into an offensive ball, I like this style. Good football. I don't like the ones who never touch the ball, say, with their left foot.\n\n'But now, I know you cannot always play this way. If they don't want me to play football, I will find space to touch the ball and try to make the difference another way. Now I manage my game.'\n\nBut with joy. Even this patient, watchful, grown-up Luiz. Always with joy.\n\nThe Diadema-born footballer poses for a picture taken by Sportsmail's Graham Chadwick\n\nLuiz isn't average because of the way he looks, the way he plays, and the glow he exudes", "Thursday's Arsenal transfer rumours: Kingsley Coman, Danny Welbeck and Nacho Monreal\n\nLast Updated: 19/07/18 8:38am\n\nArsenal are reportedly preparing a big-money move for a France international as we round up the latest transfer rumours on Thursday, July 19.\n\nHead coach Unai Emery is preparing a \u00a344m bid for Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman, according to reports in the Star.\n\nThe France international, 22, is contracted to the Bundesliga champions until the summer of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Everton are interested in signing Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck, says the Mirror.\n\nThe England forward is thought to now be surplus to requirements at the Emirates following the arrival of new boss Emery earlier this summer.\n\nElsewhere, Real Sociedad have decided against making a move for versatile Arsenal defender Nacho Monreal, reports Mundo Deportivo.\n\nThe Spaniard, who can play at either left back or as a central defender, had been expected to leave the north London club before the start of the new campaign.\n\nAnd finally, the Gunners are on the verge of capturing Barcelona left-back Joel Lopez, 16, claims the London Evening Standard.\n\nArsenal are believed to have already agreed scholarship terms with the young Spaniard.\n\nFantasy Football is back!\n\nFantasy just got real.

The balls?\n\n'Well, Lee (McCulloch) and myself had a wee tic. We would always take an adaptor with us on European trips and come back with a Champions League or UEFA Cup ball. It was simple.\n\nDavid Weir remembers his side's journey in the UEFA Cup with disappointment\n\nIn pre-match training or after matches, we would take a ball and deflate it with the adaptor and it would travel back in the hamper for us to pick up at Murray Park.'\n\nHis two oldest sons, Lucas and Jensen, would gratefully grab the balls - one from the final in Manchester - and play outside their house in Cheshire. Lucas, 17, will travel to the USA on a scholarship to play football this summer. Jensen, at 16, has signed a full-time deal with Wigan Athletic.\n\nWeir's 14-year-old daughter, Kenzie, plays for Everton. Reuben, 12, does not follow the sport, but his father, at 47, is still immersed in football.\n\n'I am a trustee of the PFA, completing a Masters in sporting directorship and helping a club with recruitment,' he says.\n\nHe is not one who looks back obsessively. He has had his sober say on the departure from Rangers, but his reflections on the European run of 2007-2008 bristle, almost unwittingly, with what was the imperative at Ibrox only ten years ago.\n\nThis is a story about how achievements can only be measured in the light of winning.\n\nBut, first, Weir makes the admission of the acquisition of match balls, adding: 'Believe it or not, there is an orange one that UEFA sent to us in case it snowed. Got that.'\n\nHe is also mildly amused to have an impressive collection of jerseys from the campaign. 'Aye, I have a Messi shirt... think it's up in the loft.' He also has the UEFA match facts from the run that started in Champions League qualifiers, continued through the group stage of Europe's biggest club competition and led to the UEFA Cup and the final in Manchester.\n\nIt included victories over Lyon and Stuttgart in the Champions League and the dismissal of Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina en route to ultimate defeat by Zenit St Petersburg in the showpiece.\n\n'They are in a room that I use as a study,' he says. 'I sometimes take them out to have a glance. There were great players in those games: Diego at Werder, (Christian) Vieri and (Adrian) Mutu at Fiorentina, (Joao) Moutinho at Sporting, (Andrey) Arshavin and (Anatoliy) Tymoshchuk at Zenit.\n\nWeir and Co lost the final against Zenit St Petersburg after a remarkable cup run\n\nAnd that was just the UEFA Cup.' However, Weir's overriding emotion is not warm nostalgia; it is cold reality. This, after all, was the Rangers of Walter Smith and the greatest of expectations.\n\n'Everything was about winning the league,' he says. 'You approached Europe professionally, you tried to do it right. But it wasn't the priority. Not really. With Walter, it was about winning the league. That was his starting point. I bet he believes that campaign cost us the league.'\n\nThis sharp reflection brings into focus the big picture of Ibrox 2007-2008.. 'I had been brought in mid-season in 2006-2007 when we were battling with Aberdeen to finish second in the league,' he adds.\n\n'We had to get results to get the second qualifying Champions League place. That was massive. We achieved that.' Weir was surprised when he was kept on.\n\n'There needed to be an upgrade and I didn't think I'd be part of it. I was an Everton sub. Then, quite quickly, I was playing for Rangers in the Champions League.'\n\nThe extraordinary European campaign started with Weir scoring in the dismissal of FC Zeta before the decisive qualifying Champions League tie against Red Star Belgrade.\n\nRangers took a 1-0 advantage to the Serbian capital for a tie that opened the way to riches.\n\n'I'd been there before with Hearts and it was really intimidating. They had signed a lot of good players to qualify for the Champions League, hoping for that windfall,' says Weir.\n\n'You knew it was a massive game because of how Walter was. You could tell by his demeanour in the days leading up to it. He wasn't one for working away on the pitch. He didn't over-coach or give you too much information.\n\nBut, in the bigger games, he stepped forward a little bit. He was more visible, more vocal. You sensed that he knew it was big, so you knew it was big.' A goalless draw put Rangers into a Champions League section with Stuttgart, Lyon and Barcelona. Seven points were taken from the first three matches: a 2-1 victory over Stuttgart at home, a 3-0 win against Lyon in France and a 0-0 draw against Barcelona at Ibrox.\n\nDefeats in Catalonia and Germany left Rangers only having to avoid defeat against Lyon at Ibrox to qualify for the knockout stage. They lost 3-0, the same score that Rangers had achieved in the Stade Gerland.\n\n'The 3-0 result in Lyon was result of the century,' he says. 'They were a really good team and, in the reverse leg, you saw the real Lyon. Sidney Govou, (Kim) Kallstrom, Juninho were all superb. (Karim) Benzema was fantastic.\n\nReality kicked in.' It seems extraordinary now, but the departure from the Champions League into the UEFA Cup was greeted with loud criticism instead of sympathetic murmurs.\n\n'We did well but, Rangers being Rangers, you are expected to beat whoever is in front of you, regardless of their quality, regardless of the situation.'\n\nWalter Smith believes the run in Europe cost Rangers in their Scottish league exploits\n\nWeir adds: 'It was crushing to go into the UEFA Cup. It was an afterthought.. The profile of competition in that time was nowhere near what it is now. The perception among the punters, too, was that we had failed.\n\n'It would be looked on as an inconvenience because it was Walter's first full season back and his rhetoric would be all about winning the league. That is what you are judged on at Rangers. You don't target getting to the final of a UEFA Cup. It was looked upon as a hindrance to winning the league by some.'\n\nSo when did winning the UEFA Cup, or at least reaching the final, come to the forefront of his mind?\n\n'I don't know if it ever did,' he says. Even after knocking out Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen and Sporting Lisbon, Weir was downbeat about the chance of ultimate glory.\n\n'Going into the Fiorentina tie, I was looking at their team and then at the squads in the other semi-final between Bayern Munich and Zenit and thinking: \"We shouldn't really be here\".\n\n'I never felt we were in it. That sounds terrible, but it was true. It wasn't about negative thinking or not trying or anything like that. It was the reality of the situation.\n\n'I never felt that it was destiny. It crept up on us. Even when the semi-final went to penalties in Florence, I thought: \"We will eff this up\".' They did not. Nacho Novo converted the penalty that sent Rangers to the final after two goalless matches. Weir, too, has little of romance to discuss about the 2-0 defeat to the Russian side in the final in Manchester.\n\nHe says: 'We lost. So, even now, I don't really think: \"I have played in a European final\". We got beaten, so I don't look back on it as a happy time.. The overriding memory is of failure. You can look at the succession of teams knocked out by us - but me, I look at it as we never ultimately won.'\n\nHowever, his study of an anniversary prompts him to make observations that have a contemporary resonance.\n\nThe 2007-2008 season saw Rangers win the Scottish Cup, League Cup, reach a UEFA Cup final and lose the league to Celtic on the last day of the season.\n\nThe title would be regained the following season, but Weir dismisses any cliche that the disappointment of losing the championship in 2008 added to the hunger that would bring it in 2009.\n\n'Not really,' he says of any thoughts he may have had about an extra incentive. 'With Walter, it was about winning the league every season. That was his starting point. He understands Rangers perfectly.\n\n'If I owned Rangers, I would have him in tomorrow to help out. He gets it. He maybe doesn't need it, but he gets it.'", "The Bayern Munich striker maintains that he has given no thought to a summer transfer and that speculation did not impact on his World Cup performance\n\nRobert Lewandowski continues to shrug off mounting transfer talk, with the Bayern Munich striker having turned a deaf ear to Manchester United and Real Madrid rumours during the World Cup.\n\nThe 29-year-old has seen his future called into question on a regular basis during recent windows, with a big-money move away from the Allianz Arena often being touted.\n\nMadrid has been mooted as a possible landing spot for some time, while Premier League sides such as United and Chelsea are also said to be keen.\n\nRelated Kovac hopes Lewandowski stays at Bayern after positive talks 'I always stand behind my team-mates and coach' - Lewandowski claims he was 'misunderstood' Lewandowski bemoans Poland's lack of risk-taking in costly Senegal defeat Has 'big-game bottler' Lewandowski blown his shot at joining Real Madrid?\n\nLewandowski has, however, never publicly stated a desire to leave Bayern and maintains that the speculation which surrounds him did not impact on a disappointing showing for Poland at Russia 2018.\n\nHe told Przeglad Sportowy: \"I didn't think about it because I've been playing football for many years and this sort of situation has happened with all my transfers - whether it's from Znicz to Lech [Poznan] or from Lech [Pruszkow] to Borussia Dortmund or from BVB to Bayern.\n\n\"I've learned how to handle these situations.\"\n\nLewandowski's decision to make Pini Zahavi his new agent in February was considered by many to be a sign indication that he is ready to take on a new challenge.\n\nThe Israeli 'super agent' has claimed that the Pole is actively seeking a move elsewhere, telling Sport Bild in May: \"Robert feels he needs a change and a new challenge in his career. The managers of Bayern know about it.\"\n\nLewandowski has, however, revealed that he told Zahavi not to inform him of any interest during the World Cup.\n\nHe added: \"Yes, it was exactly like that.

I look at it like that. The next five games are about fitness.\n\n'I want to prove to the manager that I can be in his team.

Indeed, Anthony Martial, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Antonio Valencia, Chris Smalling, Eric Bailly, Luke Shaw, Matteo Darmian, Scott McTominay and Sergio Romero are the only recognisable first-team players in a squad bolstered by the inclusion of no fewer than seven teenagers and new signing Diogo Dalot.\n\nSanchez, a South American star with Chile who would appeal to the Hispanic football fans in California, Arizona and Miami, where United end their tour against Madrid, is not a man whose absence can be easily overlooked. Nor are the American public so easily satisfied these days.\n\nICC organisers have already been forced to downgrade United's game against Milan from the 90,000-capacity Pasadena Rose Bowl to the 27,000 StubHub Center in Carson City.\n\nSanchez has struggled to hit top form since arriving at United in the January transfer window\n\nMAN UTD PRE-SEASON\n\nJuly 20: Club America (Phoenix Stadium, Arizona) 3am\n\nJuly 23: San Jose Earthquakes, Levi's Stadium, California) Midnight\n\nJuly 26: AC Milan (International Champions Cup - StubHub Center, California) 4am\n\nJuly 28: Liverpool (International Champions Cup - Michigan Stadium, Michigan) 10pm\n\nAugust 1: Real Madrid (International Champions Cup - Hard Rock Stadium, Florida) 1am\n\nAugust 5: Bayern Munich (Allianz Arena) 7.15pm\n\n*All dates and times BST\n\nAlthough United's clash with Liverpool in the Big House in Michigan is a 102,000 sell-out, the club emailed fans on Monday advertising ticket availability for other games.\n\nHigh ticket prices are not helping matters. More than 80,000 fans saw United play LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl when Louis van Gaal's side toured America in 2014, and the interest is undoubtedly there. But this will be the second year in a row that the Premier League club have had to make do with the more modest surroundings in Carson.\n\nUnited remain a big draw in the US but a few more star names always help. Some here still recall the 2004 tour when Sir Alex Ferguson was forced to parachute Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy into his squad after he was fiercely criticised for fielding an understrength team against Bayern Munich in Chicago.\n\nNow United sorely need Sanchez to add a little stardust to their trip. Time is still on his side, but that paperwork can't come through soon enough.\n\nManchester United's match with AC Milan has been relegated to the StubHub Center", "Manchester City face the ignominy of being relegated to a third-placed Champions League seeding for next season's competition if they don't beat Bayern Munich at home on Tuesday night.\n\nManuel Pellegrini's side need victory over the German champions at the Etihad to have any hope at all of qualifying for the next stage of the tournament after losing two games and drawing two so far.\n\nHowever, City also need to make sure that if they don't qualify then they at least finish third in the group and go in to the Europa League. If they were to finish bottom, they will be in grave danger of seeing their coefficient dropping so low that they would go back to being a third seed in next summer's draw.\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to see Bayern destroy Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga last weekend\n\nSergio Aguero and David Silva pictured during training ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League game\n\nManuel Pellegrini's Manchester City side have not won a Champions League match this season\n\nThe Premier League champions have endured a stuttering start to the 2014-15 season\n\nIt was as third seeds that City were drawn in such impossible groups in their first two years in the Champions League. This time they were a second seed and that saw them handed a group that should - in theory at least - have been a little easier.\n\nFailure to beat Roma at home and just one point from six against CSKA Moscow, however, has left Pellegrini's team in dire straits ahead of their game against Pep Guardiola's outfit.\n\nIt is expected that UEFA will change the seeding system a little for next year's competition, with the winners of the Champions League and also the winners of each of Europe's top seven leagues automatically receiving top seed status.\n\nCity, though, would need to overhaul Chelsea and win the Barclays Premier League for that to be relevant.\n\nYaya Toure and former Bayern Munich man Martin Demichelis (left) share a joke during training\n\nCity were beaten 1-0 when they last played Bayern Munich - former player Jerome Boateng scored the winner\n\nThe Bundesliga champions train in Manchester ahead of their clash at the Etihad Stadium", "The World Athletics Championships ended, predictably, in an orgy of self-congratulation.\n\nLord Coe, of the IAAF, was thanked by the BBC for laying on the greatest games ever, Coe returned the praise to the broadcaster for their wonderful coverage. Back in the studio all the talk was of how soon the event could return to London. We're so fine, do-lang, do-lang, do-lang, as The Chiffons didn't sing.\n\n'That's why athletics is the greatest sport in the world,' cooed a commentator, surveying a podium containing one Russian athlete, running as a neutral because his country is so bent it is banned, and a gold medallist from Qatar, who has the unique distinction of being the first medal-winner from that country to be born there.\n\nLord Coe was thanked by the BBC for laying on the greatest games ever on Sunday evening\n\nLike Qatar's Bulgarian weightlifters, his predecessors were always imported, at a price.\n\nThat little peccadillo -- the ruthless corruption of nationality in sport -- did not stop Qatar getting the 2019 edition of the Championships, though.\n\nAnd the issue of fixing and other questionable practices now being investigated in the United States, did not stop the 2021 event going to Nike central in Eugene, Oregon, either. Capacity at Eugene's Hayward Field venue is only slightly smaller than the ground at MK Dons.\n\nSo, there's the reality. Not that athletics is coming home any time soon, but that it is a tainted pursuit that sells off its main event to the highest bidder, and the warmth felt for it at the London Stadium was a brief moment in time, no more.\n\n'There is growing confidence within the sport,' insisted IAAF president Coe. 'People are proud to be involved.'\n\n'There is growing confidence within the sport,' insisted IAAF president Coe (right)\n\nLook, this is Britain. It does not take much to make us proud. The economy is starting to tank and we're still banging on patriotically about hard Brexit. We win a few medals in the relay and we're kings of the world. Give us a big event and we'll get behind it.\n\nLast year, 81,781 turned up at Wembley to watch a football team that had just been beaten by Iceland play Malta.\n\nWe go to Test matches in big numbers, whether we're any good at cricket or not. We fill huge stadiums for para athletics events. We were the worst performing host team in Rugby World Cup history, and you still can't get a ticket at Twickenham for love nor money.\n\nYou'd want us in the front row at every gig you played but, let's be honest, we're not the most discerning crowd. We laugh at any joke, applaud any entrance. We're up for it all, the best house a rotten turn could hope for.\n\nSo, Coe might not want to take London to the bank just yet. Normal service will be resumed in Doha in 2019, where attendances are typically low. Just 15,000 tickets were sold for the Para Athletics Championships there in 2015, compared to 230,000 in London this summer. The Asian Cup and Qatar Open tennis were also sparsely attended.\n\nYet Doha and athletics are a lovely fit. That's where the event should be held, really, so we can see it for what it is. Full of apologists and cheerleaders and in thrall to commerce. This is also why Nike -- the company that endorses and embraces the drug cheat Justin Gatlin, booed in London don't forget -- gets its payback in 2021.\n\nJustin Gatlin won gold in the 100m at the World Athletics Championships, but was booed\n\nEugene was the host award that bypassed a formal bidding process, a decision so suspect it is being investigated by the FBI. Before London, the IAAF took their marquee event to Russia and China. You can't claim 2017 as a typical year for the sport.\n\nIt was Gatlin who talked of the narrative being about white hats and black hats -- good guys and bad guys -- but in athletics even the white hats are often grey around the edges.\n\nAt the time the 2021 host city was being debated, Lord Coe was on the IAAF Council and the payroll at Nike. He made plain his support for Eugene to a senior Nike executive, Craig Masback, a fact revealed by the BBC. Maybe those in front of camera don't watch their own channel.\n\nSo, anyway, to answer the queries of the BBC panel: 2023. That's the earliest the IAAF World Championships can return, by which time Laura Muir will be 30. But it won't return then because the sport the BBC think they are covering, the one they called greatest in the world, does not exist.\n\nIt should, because there is nothing in essence purer than a foot race or a throwing contest, but athletics is undermined by drugs and corrupt executives and state-sponsored doping and participants who sell their passports to the highest bidder, and there will be plenty of vested interests jostling to host in six years' time and all are ready to pay. Azerbaijan, come on down.\n\nSo, for all the phoney euphoria, Qatar is welcome to it. Eugene, too. Anywhere but London. The love of the common people shouldn't be turned into handy camouflage for the IAAF. Let Doha show athletics for what it is.\n\nGet ready for PSG v UEFA in court\n\nIf reports are correct and Paris Saint-Germain are about to buy Kylian Mbappe, it can mean only one thing: they are now prepared to go to court over financial fair play. At the end of this campaign, PSG are going to be assessed by UEFA over a period of three seasons from 2015-16 to 2017-18, and there is no way they can rustle up revenue streams to cover such enormous transfer outlay.\n\nThis means an appearance before UEFA's Club Financial Control Body where, since they have already been fined for a previous offence, any punishment is likely to be elevated to suspension from European competition. Certainly that is what PSG's rivals, the traditional elite whose position at the pinnacle is threatened, will push for. Leaving aside the reaction from UEFA's commercial partners -- who certainly didn't sponsor the competition so the best players could be left in limbo to keep Bayern Munich happy -- the likely upshot of any playing sanction is a court case.\n\nThe old version of FFP went down the tubes at the first hint of a legal challenge, and UEFA will fear a repeat for their revamped rulebook. Certainly they will run out of money long before Qatar do, the first fear of any respondent.\n\nThey can argue PSG knew the rules before entering, which they did. PSG can argue restraint of trade, which it is. If a club owner can afford the transfers, why shouldn't the club be able to facilitate them? And why do UEFA alone get to define financial fair play? Equally, if PSG challenge, don't think others won't enlist.\n\nManchester City, certainly, will be watching any developments with interest, even if joining forces with a Qatari investment fund means holding their noses a little.\n\nNeymar moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a3198million in the summer window\n\nLet's not pretend watching in bed takes commitment\n\nNothing against Sir Patrick Stewart, who is undoubtedly a genuine Huddersfield fan. But the photograph of him enjoying the club's first Premier League victory summed up why Richard Scudamore was wrong to equate the investment of supporters abroad and those who actually go to the games.\n\nStewart, of necessity, must spend a lot of time out of this country. According to the image he posted on Saturday, he was in Canada when his team put three past Crystal Palace. The picture shows Stewart, in his Huddersfield shirt, arms aloft in celebration, watching the game on his laptop. He also appears to be in bed.\n\nMeaning, when the final whistle blows he can, if he wishes, roll over and go back to sleep. At this point, those that actually went to the game are embarking on a good five hours back to Huddersfield. From where Crystal Palace is located it can take two hours just to get to the M1. And no doubt it was a grand journey home.\n\nIt always is when your team wins 3-0. But this is Huddersfield. They won't always win 3-0 away, and it won't always be a pleasant August afternoon, either. Most weekends it will be cold and wet, because football in the northern hemisphere is played in winter.\n\nHuddersfield striker Steve Mounie scored twice on his Premier League debut on Saturday\n\nAnd while this does not apply to the loyal Sir Patrick -- president of the Huddersfield Town academy since 2010 -- a website called Dugout reveals another little difference with foreign fans. Dugout is aimed at supporters around the world and allows them to sign for updates on their favourite clubs and players. It is based on research that suggests fans around the world follow, on average, 4.6 clubs in Europe, often multiples within the same league.\n\nThey have similar attachment to players, too. So if Neymar leaves Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain, his Asian fans follow.\n\nSo a little more respect from Scudamore is due. Fans abroad can still be passionate and committed. But if you can watch the match propped up by pillows, or Liverpool are one of the six clubs you support, don't ever think it is the same.\n\nTime for Jonjo to shelve his England hope\n\nBack in July, Jonjo Shelvey suggested England were crying out for a central midfielder, and he could fit the bill. Sunday's match against Tottenham showed why that is so much hooey.\n\nAs Fabio Capello pointed out, international football, like the Champions League, is a cut above. Once the early stages are over, success means beating the best in the world.\n\nThat is close to impossible with 10 men -- and, on Sunday, Shelvey reacted to the mildest provocation from Dele Alli by treading on his ankle in front of the referee.\n\nA red card was inevitable. At the time the score was 0-0 and Newcastle were holding on, under pressure. Tottenham walked away with it after that.\n\nAlli can be hot-headed, too, but he possesses talent that makes him worth the trouble. Shelvey does not.\n\nHe is a journeyman midfielder with an inflated sense of his ability and a penchant for trouble. England need him no more than they ever needed Joey Barton.\n\nHow hard can it be to draw the League Cup?\n\nIs it really that hard to draw a knock-out tournament? It seems close to impossible if you're the Football League. Fresh from the triumph of having Charlton playing twice in the first round of the Carabao Cup -- the League Cup to anyone over 35 -- they made such a hash of the second round that even the clubs involved were signalling bemusement.\n\n'We will be at home to QPR,' announced Brentford. 'Or maybe away, we're not sure.'\n\nIn a nutshell, some genius at the Football League left the mechanics of the draw to John Salako, meaning that for the first four matches every team they said was away was at home, and every team they said was at home was away. Apart from West Ham who genuinely were away having been drawn at home, but that's another story. Either way, it was a mess.\n\n'Our life is frittered away by detail...simplify, simplify,' wrote Thoreau. That, or don't put John Salako in charge. Either works, really.\n\nJohn Salako had a rather difficult time when helping to draw the League Cup second round ties\n\nAlastair Campbell was pontificating on cheating in sport on the pages of The Guardian last week. It's a very bad thing, apparently. Very naughty and the fans don't like it. In this context, though, it is worth pointing out that Campbell's interviews with Lance Armstrong are still available online and well worth reading, although be careful lest your sides split.\n\n'To some, many of them French, who would rather one of their own had dominated the Tour de France, he is a cheat...' Campbell writes.\n\nThat was before Armstrong admitted, yes, he cheated.\n\nWise words, mate. Wise words.\n\nThere were finer goals at the weekend, of course, but surely none better than Wayne Rooney's winner for Everton. It just meant more.\n\nHow unfortunate that since returning as a clean athlete, Maria Sharapova has been almost permanently injured. It is as if she needs some form of invisible force field to protect her; something nobody else can see.\n\nSince the death of Paul Daniels the world of magic has been in mourning. We should salute, therefore, the wonderful conjuring skills of the PGA Tour who, over four days between Thursday and Sunday, made their tournament disappear.\n\nLiverpool play at Hoffenheim on Tuesday night, but Philippe Coutinho does not. If the Champions League qualifiers go badly, he may wish to consider moving a lot farther from Merseyside than Barcelona.", "There is only one day left until MailOnline's European Super League Fantasy Football game kicks-off, but fear not, there is still time remaining to pick your very own ultimate team.\n\nWe know crafting a team with the right balance and point scoring ability can be a headache, especially with players to select from across the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and the Eredivisie.\n\nBut don't worry because Sportsmail have you covered. We have put together a scouting guide to some of the best bargain buys and ingenious transfers to help you utilise and profit from your \u00a375million budget.\n\nDries Mertens - \u00a37.6m\n\nThe pacey Belgian forward is a shoo-in to bag your side countless amount of points this season. While everyone else splashes a large proportion of their budget on the Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's of this world - which typically results in a cheap fringe player being chucked into their side somewhere along the way - you'll be getting a skillful and creative striker who scored 28 goals in 35 games and bagged 254 points last season - the third-highest scorer - to lead your line.\n\nDries Mertens was the cream of the crop for Napoli scoring 28 Serie A goals in 35 games\n\nDani Alves - \u00a36.3m\n\nSurprisingly, the Brazilian wing back is available at just a snip of the price he should be at just \u00a36.3m. The former Barcelona and Juventus defender oozes class and even at the age of 34 continues to present a danger going forward as well as offering Paris Saint-Germain some stability at the back. His goalscoring form last season is testament to that. Alvez returned an impressive five goals from right back for Juventus last season and has already scored for his new team, a delightful free-kick against Monaco in the French Super Cup.\n\nMarco Asensio - \u00a36.6m\n\nReal Madrid's new star will prove to be a shrewd investment this season. The 21-year-old scored a screamer on Wednesday to complete Barcelona's humiliation as Madrid celebrated winning the Spanish Super Cup. Asensio only played 23 league games last season but the gifted attacking midfielder has developed and is ready to break through to Zinedine Zidane's starting line-up this season. As a player who likes to get forward, he's a great fit into Madrid's set-up and is sure to reap the benefits from their productive play.\n\nMarco Asensio is Real Madrid's latest whizzkid and is set to break into the first team this season\n\nOusmane Dembele - \u00a37.2m\n\nThe French winger's impending transfer to Barcelona makes him a savvy buy. Dembele is not the cheapest acquisition but with his move to the Nou Camp about to be completed, he's good value for money. The 20-year-old is about to become a key player for a massive team and his pace, trickery and youthfulness is sure to make him a star in Spain.\n\nOusmane Dembele is waiting on a move to Spain and he will be a huge point scorer this season\n\nJose Gimenez - \u00a35.9m\n\nGimenez is potentially the most cost-effective buy out the lot. Given how Diego Simeone likes to set up his Atletico Madrid side, finding a way to insert an Atletico defender into your trusted XI is a smart way to bag some undetected points. Simeone's side conceded the least amount of goals in La Liga last season and the 22-year-old is starting to become an integral part of their defence alongside fellow Uruguayan Diego Godin.\n\nDavinson Sanchez - \u00a36.1m\n\nAjax's young defender could be on his way to Tottenham and signing him up could be that risky purchase which pays off. It depends on two things, one, if he moves to Tottenham will he play a sufficient amount of games to tally up points? And two, will he stay? If he does Sanchez is an assured acquisition, the Colombian defender played a vital role for Ajax's defence last season and proved he is certainly destined for higher heights than the Eredivisie.\n\nIf Davinson Sanchez stays at Ajax he will be an ideal acqusition to rack up some fantasy points\n\nMarcel Sabitzer - \u00a36.5m\n\nRed Bull Leipzig were last season's surprise package. In their first season in Germany's top flight after securing promotion only the year earlier, Leipzig's fearless and youthful squad stormed to a second-placed finish. Midfielder Sabitzer was a pivotal figure in their successful season, scoring eight Bundesliga goals in 32 games. At just \u00a36.5m the Austria international is an absolute steal.\n\nDavid Alaba - \u00a36.6m\n\nBayern Munich's Alaba has developed into one of the world's best over the past few years. The Austria international was deployed in Midfield for most of last season but is available to be selected as a defender which spells good news. Munich only conceded 22 goals in 34 league games last season and Alaba is sure to bag you some defensive points, especially with Manuel Neuer in the sticks behind him.\n\nDavid Alaba has consistently performed for Bayern Munich and is a reliable fantasy player\n\nKasper Dolberg - \u00a37.0m\n\nDolberg is fast becoming a wanted man after showing a certain level of maturity to net 16 goals in his first full Eredivisie campaign last season. The 19-year-old has quickly developed into one of the hottest prospects in Europe and despite interest from AC Milan looks set for another year at the Johan Cruijff Arena. The prolific striker is a certainty to score even more this time around and his inclusion in your side may well fire you to glory.\n\nFabinho \u00a36.4m\n\nMonaco's tenacious defender made a name for himself last season as his performances helped the French side break Paris Saint-Germain's hold on the league title. The 23-year-old scored nine league goals and contributed to Monaco registering the second-best defensive record in France to fire them to their first Ligue 1 title in 17 years. Available to purchase as a defender, his versatility could be your secret weapon.\n\nFabinho's versatility makes him a shrewd purchase and he is very affordable at just \u00a36.4million", "Scoring starts this Friday (August 18) in the MailOnline's European Super League Fantasy Football game, so what are you waiting for?\n\nJoin now and spend your \u00a375million budget on players from the Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A and even the Eredivisie.\n\nUse your knowledge of football on the continent, or just take a punt on a bunch of strikers to get loads of goals in Holland...

Robert Lewandowski and Thiago are both for sale at the right price from Bayern Munich. United have the cash to reinforce both positions before the start of the season. They are also interested in both Alex Sandro of Juventus and Toby Alderweireld, with a chance both transfers could go through with more negotiation over price.\n\nPaper Round's view: It is puzzling as to why Jose Mourinho wants Lewandowski. As excellent as he can be, United have Romelu Lukaku and only use two strikers in attack intermittently. Thiago would be a huge upgrade on some of their existing midfielders, though. Most pressing are the Sandro and Alderweireld transfers, given the state of their defence.\n\nRead the full story\n\nRoma goalkeeper Alisson is on the verge of completing his \u00a366m move to Liverpool. The Premier League club have had their bid accepted and are now preparing for the 25-year-old Brazilian to complete a medical before finalising the deal. The club have stolen a march on Chelsea, who are expected to be in the market for a replacement for Thibaut Courtois.\n\nPaper Round's view: Chelsea look set to miss out on what would be an excellent replacement for Courtois, and rumoured replacements Petr Cech and Kasper Schmeichel would be a step down. For Liverpool, it could be a transformative move as they have now strengthened every part of their squad, addressing all the key weaknesses. They might well be Manchester City's closest rival.\n\nRead the full story\n\nAfter the transfers of Jean-Michael Seri and Maxime Le Marchand from Nice in a \u00a330m, Fulham are set to make another transfer as they prepare for life in the Premier League. They are set to complete the permanent signing of Aleksandar Mitrovic from Newcastle United, who spent part of last season on loan with Fulham. The 23-year-old Serbian international is on a post-World Cup break, and should complete a \u00a320m move upon his return.\n\nPaper Round's view: Seri was a player wanted by some of the top sides in the Premier League, given his affordable transfer release clause and his relatively young age, and should give them steel in the midfield. Mitrovic is another combative player, who is exceptionally effective in causing aggro around the box, and isn't a bad finisher either. Fulham may be playing catch-up on the rest of the league, but they will not be bullied.\n\nRead the full story\n\nSean Dyche looks set to continue his purchases of young British talent for Burnley. The two players he has in his sights at the moment are Swansea City players, Sam Clucas and defender Alfie Mawson. The move comes after Dyche was frustrated in his pursuit of West Bromwich Albion due Craig Dawson and Jay Rodriguez, for whom he had a \u00a325m joint bid rejected.\n\nPaper Round's view: Dyche continues to stick to the template that has served him well over the past few seasons. Given his ability to develop young players, both Mawson and Clucas would probably do well under his management, and fill out the Burnley squad. It would be no surprise to see both Rodriguez and Dawson also arrive, given Dyche has to prepare for additional Europa League games.", "We may be in the middle of a break from Premier League action, but there has still been plenty happening in the lower leagues and on the international stage.\n\nSam Allardyce began his reign as England manager with a win, while Scotland and Northern Ireland were also in World Cup qualifying action.\n\nSportsmail looks at the 10 things we learned from this weekend's football.\n\nSam Allardyce began his time in charge of the England national team in Slovakia on Sunday\n\n1. Sam Allardyce has always prided himself on his team's set pieces - so has got a lot of work to do to solve the riddle of who takes England's corners and how.\n\nWayne Rooney was the designated man in Slovakia, but only one of nine ended with an England head getting to the ball first - and on that occasion Gary Cahill had already been penalised for pushing.\n\nAt least the peculiar Roy Hodgson experiment of having Harry Kane take them seems to be over - but is it really so good that the next man for the job is the country's all-time leading scorer?\n\nWayne Rooney took England's corners but only one of nine found a Three Lions head\n\n2. Matt Ritchie's decision to turn his back on the Premier League and join relegated Newcastle in a \u00a312m move from Bournemouth was one of the more surprising transfers of the summer window.\n\nHe was one of the key players for Eddie Howe last season, but still agreed to drop into the Championship.\n\nRafa Benitez will be hoping his new signing will maintain the form he showed in a Scotland shirt in Malta - Ritchie made two of the goals in his country's 5-1 win, and created six other chances.\n\nMatt Ritchie made two goals for Scotland and will be vital in Newcastle's push for promotion\n\n3. One of the mysteries of Euro 2016 was what happened to Thomas Muller, who not only failed to score in six matches but also missed his penalty in the semi-final shoot-out defeat to France.\n\nIt was a rare tournament failure from the striker who followed the Golden Boot in the 2010 World Cup with the Silver Boot in 2014. What's the saying about form being temporary and class permanent?\n\nThe 26-year-old Bayern Munich star was back on target as the Germans opened their World Cup campaign with a 3-0 win in Norway. Muller struck twice to take his total international tally to 34 goals from 79 caps.\n\nThomas Muller scored twice; maybe the saying 'form is temporary, class is permanent' is true\n\n4. Steven Davis will be 32 in January but it isn't hard to see why Southampton were happy to hand him a new three-year contract in the summer.\n\nThe Northern Ireland captain was full of energy and industry to help his side earn a point against the Czech Republic, which they probably didn't deserve.\n\nDavis won the ball back 14 times in Prague, and the way he shields the defence is one of the reasons why Michael O'Neill's side have conceded only 11 goals in their last 18 internationals.\n\nSteven Davis (centre) is 32, but it is easy to see why Southampton gave him a new contract\n\n5. Cristian Gamboa has left West Bromwich Albion as a classic case of why it's rarely wise to buy players on the back of a successful major tournament.\n\nWest Brom's recruitment department spent \u00a32m on the Costa Rican defender after watching him in the 2014 World Cup, only for head coach at that time Alan Irvine not to rate or play him. At 5ft 8ins tall he was never going to fit the Tony Pulis blueprint of what a defender should look like, either.\n\nGamboa has now gone to Celtic where he may or may not prosper - but in the meantime has just won his 50th cap helping his country earn a 1-0 win in Haiti at the start of a new World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nCristian Gamboa has joined Celtic after his disastrous time at West Bromwich Albion\n\n6. Fresh from humiliating England, Iceland are on the verge of claiming another notable scalp.\n\nTheir Under 21 side have jumped to the top of a qualifying group for next summer's European Championships that includes France, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Ukraine.\n\nA French team that included Atletico Madrid defender Lucas Hernandez, a \u00a320m summer target for Manchester City, lost 1-0 in the Ukraine and anything other than victory over Iceland in Caen on Tuesday would all but end their hopes of reaching the finals.\n\nIceland beat England at Euro 2016 (pictured) and now their U21 side are close to another scalp\n\n7. Aston Villa fans have been cheering the brilliant overhead goal scored by their new \u00a312m signing Jonathan Kodjia for Ivory Coast against Sierra Leone as evidence that Roberto di Matteo has another asset in his bid to take the club back to the Premier League.\n\nThey may not be so happy about it after Christmas, however, especially if the 26-year-old is reproducing by then the sort of form that brought him 19 Championship goals for Bristol City last season.\n\nKodjia's spectacular effort clinched the Ivory Coast's place in the Africa Cup of Nations - meaning he could be missing for two months at a vital part of the season.\n\nJonathan Kodjia could miss two months of Aston Villa's season at the Africa Cup of Nations\n\n8. Even smaller clubs tend to rotate their squad for League Cup ties these days, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for playing a strong team and trying to find some momentum.\n\nThat's certainly what AFC Wimbledon boss Neal Ardley would tell you after following up a 3-0 EFL Cup success over Swansea's Under 23 side by securing the club's first win of the season in League One.\n\nEight of the side who beat the Premier League club a few days earlier were involved in securing a 2-1 win against Chesterfield that lifted the Dons out of the relegation zone.\n\nNeal Ardley's AFC Wimbledon beat Swansea U23s (pictured) and then Chesterfield\n\n9. Chelsea's policy of renting out players - they have 38 in total on loan deals to other clubs - doesn't make it easy for any of their younger stars to force their way through.\n\nGoalkeeper Jamal Blackman, aged 22, let in 19 goals in 12 games on loan to Swedish club Ostersunds in the summer which can't have helped his confidence.\n\nHe's still very much at the hairy end of the coconut shy following his latest move to injury hit Wycombe. A 4-1 defeat at Luton means he's picked the ball out of the net 10 times in five matches so far.\n\nJamal Blackman has had a tough time on loan for Chelsea, and is currently at Wycombe\n\n10. Several League One clubs looked at midfielder Liam Noble when he was released by Notts County at the end of last season, but he chose instead to follow manager Mark Cooper by dropping into the National League at Forest Green Rovers.\n\nSo far it's looking a good call for player and club. His first goal of the season set up a 2-1 win at Chester which took the Gloucestershire side, owned by green energy millionaire Dale Vince, to the top of the table.", "De Ligt is considered one of the hottest prospects in Europe at the moment\n\nManchester City are set to launch a sensational \u00a350million bid for Ajax wonderkid Matthijs de Ligt this summer.\n\nPep Guardiola's side are not short of central defenders with Vincent Kompany, Nicolas Otamendi, John Stones and Aymeric Laporte already at the club.\n\nHowever, with captain Kompany now 32 years of age, Guardiola has identified De Ligt as the long-term replacement for the Belgian.\n\nManchester City are set to launch a stunning \u00a350million bid for Matthijs de Ligt this summer\n\nDespite being just 18, De Ligt is rated highly at the Johan Cruyff Arena and is considered one of the hottest prospects in Europe after breaking into Ajax's first team last year.\n\nHe is contracted to Ajax until 2021 and they are likely to demand a hefty fee for his services, but City are confident they can prise him away.\n\nArsenal, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are also said to be interested in the youngster, who starred alongside now Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez last season for Ajax.\n\nPep Guardiola's side are not short of central defenders with four options already at the club\n\nHowever, Guardiola has identified De Ligt as the long-term replacement for Vincent Kompany\n\nHe is contracted to Ajax until 2021 and they are likely to demand a hefty fee for his services\n\nWhen recently asked about Kompany's future, Guardiola said: 'We will see.

Hopefully, next season, that won't happen. But it is the same case with Yaya Toure as it is with Vinny. They have already won three Premier Leagues. When you win three Premier Leagues, you have to start to talk about something serious because it is not easy to win one.\n\n'I think with Vincent it depends on him and his physical condition.

Chelsea and Arsenal are also among his admirers.\n\nRiyad Mahrez was devastated after his move to City fell through and hopes it can still happen\n\nJustin Kluivert (Ajax)\n\nThe 18-year-old son of former Holland and Newcastle striker Patrick, young Kluivert is making a name for himself as a winger of note. Already valued in the \u00a340m bracket, Justin has impressed the likes of Jose Mourinho and Ernest Valverde at Barcelona.

Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool have watched the Portugal international extensively and he is a classic-style winger who beats his man and gets the cross over. City may demand he learns a bit more but certainly has the raw talent and has scored 10 goals.\n\nTottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool have watched Gelson Martins extensively\n\nEden Hazard (Chelsea)\n\nReal Madrid have been expected to start the bidding for Hazard but City have a genuine interest too, the flaw is whether Chelsea would sell to a Premier League rival.

We're not a club with a huge past like United or Liverpool, Barcelona or Real Madrid or Bayern Munich - so it will (allow) around the world to know who we are as a club, not just in the locker room but outside the locker room.' Incredibly, victory at Southampton on Sunday would their 32nd win out of 38 and take them to the magical 100-point mark.\n\nBut Guardiola doesn't know how the season will be portrayed. 'The club spoke with the captains, the captains spoke with the team and staff, and they decided it was OK and good for the club.\n\n'So it was cameras inside of the locker room, what's going on and what they're going to show, I don't know.\n\n'We'll leave what people are going to see to the producers, the editors, the directors - they're going to create the chapters (episodes). Hopefully, it's going to be nice. I don't know.'\n\nThe multi-episode series will be shown on Amazon Prime Video in more than 200 countries\n\nAmazon have struck lucky with their filming coinciding with City winning the title\n\nGuardiola has a reputation of being a perfectionist and is already looking at ways his players can improve including right-back Kyle Walker, one of five City players in the PFA Premier League team of the season.\n\n'We are all so satisfied with his level. We spoke many times, similar to when we speak with Raz [Raheem Sterling] and Leroy [Sane]. He still has a big gap to improve - his style, his way to play, his focus in the game.\n\n'Hopefully we can help him have a target for the next season and try to help him to be a better player next season. His accuracy with the ball, with the simple things, the simple passes. I see sometimes he'll lose the ball.\n\n'He can be focused on what he needs to do for 90 minutes, sometimes he high moments and then after that can be a little bit low. Like a defender, he has to maintain a 7 or 8 all the time.'\n\nGuardiola is already looking at ways his players can improve including right-back Kyle Walker\n\nWalker is one of several City players who will be named in Gareth Southgate's England squad on Wednesday. He is a certainty along with John Stones and Raheem Sterling, and Fabian Delph also has a chance of making it.\n\nGoalkeeper Joe Hart, on loan at West Ham this season, could also be included though Guradiola doesn't know where his future lies after this summer.\n\n'He is going to come back here and I think his manager (agent) is going to speak with the club and they are going to decide,' he said.\n\nOne of Guardiola's first decisions after taking over at City in 2016 was to tell Hart he wasn't part of his plans and the England 'keeper went first to Torino and then West Ham on loan.", "Guardiola said he was 'so happy and excited' after penning the new contract\n\nPep Guardiola has signed a two-year contract extension at Manchester City after leading the club to the Premier League title.\n\nThe Spaniard, who still had 12 months left on his current deal, has committed his future to City until the end of the 2020-21 season - meaning he will have been in charge at the Etihad longer than his two previous clubs Barcelona or Bayern Munich.\n\nThe news is a massive boost to City at the end of a memorable season in which they have won the Premier League and shattered a number of records including those for most points, most wins and most goals. Guardiola's side also lifted the Carabao Cup.\n\nPep Guardiola pens the new contract alongside Ferran Soriano (L) and Txiki Begiristain (R)\n\n'I am so happy and excited. It's a pleasure to be able to work here,' Guardiola told City's official website. 'I enjoy working with our players every day and we will try to do our best together in the coming years. As a manager, you have to feel good to be with the players - and I feel good.\n\n'I will focus on the desire of my players to become a better team and every day that's what I will try to do - to improve on the pitch and improve our players.\n\n'We have a young squad with an average age of 23 and we want to keep taking steps forward and maintain the levels we've achieved this season.'\n\nIt's understood that the club's Abu Dhabi owners have rewarded the 47-year-old coach by increasing his salary from \u00a315million-a-year to closer to \u00a320m.\n\nThe Spaniard has agreed terms on a new two-year extension keeping him at City until 2021\n\nGuardiola's City side clinched the Premier League title by a record margin this campaign\n\nThey are delighted that Guardiola has agreed to stay longer amid concerns that a man who had never worked at a club longer than four years, and needed a sabbatical after leaving Barcelona in 2012, might quit at the end of his initial three-year deal at the Etihad.\n\nThe issue would certainly have become a distraction next season as Guardiola entered the final 12 months of his contract, but it has been resolved before he leaves on holiday with his wife and three children.\n\nCity's Chief Executive Ferran Soriano, who was present at the contract signing alongside director of football Txiki Begiristain, added: 'Pep's new contract extension is fantastic news for Manchester City.\n\n'We have all been privileged to witness how we have played beautiful football, won titles, broken records and reached the incredible mark of 100 Premier League points.\n\nGuardiola won the Premier League and Carabao Cup in 2017-18 - his second season at the club\n\n'Pep has shown this style can succeed in the Premier League in a way it has never been done before.'\n\nExtending Guardiola's contract will also help City to attract their transfer targets, with Napoli's Jorginho and Riyad Mahrez, of Leicester, expected to be the latest players through the door this summer.\n\nGuardiola has secured a win ratio of 68 per cent over his two seasons at the Etihad, amassing 77 victories in 113 matches since joining in the summer of 2016.\n\nCity became the first side in Premier League history to break the 100-point barrier with their 1-0 win over Southampton on the final day of the campaign.\n\nGuardiola and his coaching staff pose with the Carabao Cup after they beat Arsenal in the final\n\nThe new contract means the 47-year-old could spend longer at City than he did at Barcelona", "The City chairman has pledged to back him in the transfer market again\n\nManchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak believes Pep Guardiola will be 'relentless' in pursuit of more success and has pledged to back him in the transfer market again this summer.\n\nGuardiola won the Premier League in record-breaking fashion before signing a new three-year deal at the Etihad last week.\n\nNo team has clinched back-to-back titles since Manchester United in 2009, and Al-believes the club's Spanish coach will be driven to win it again next season.\n\nManchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak insists Pep Guardiola will remain 'relentless'\n\n'We have a manager in Pep who is relentless,' he said. 'There is not going to be any content or relaxation here, that I can assure you.\n\n'I have no doubt that this summer we are going to come back and be hungry, and more aggressive. My expectation, and the manager's expectation, is that this team will continue to improve.\n\n'We have real experiences, real learnings from how we managed our seasons following the last two times we won the league (in 2012 and 2014).\n\n'We've worked very hard over the last couple of years to build the squad, not just only for this season but for many seasons to come.'\n\nAl Mubarak is ready to spend again this summer but insists he will only bring in new players who can improve the squad.\n\nGuardiola won the Premier League with City in record-breaking fashion this season\n\nCity have been strongly linked with Napoli playmaker Jorginho and Riyad Mahrez, having failed with a \u00a360million move for the Leicester winger in January.\n\n'This is my biggest learning from the years of chairing this club,' he added.\n\n'Bringing new players in is a very important decision because you have a winning formula. Whatever you're going to add has to be a decision you don't take very lightly at all. Any additions have to improve the squad.'\n\nOn Guardiola's new contract, which ties the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach to the Etihad until 2021, Al Mubarak said: 'This was not a hard discussion.\n\n'I think we see eye to eye. We shook hands on it and are happy to continue this journey.'\n\nGuardiola's side claimed a remarkable 100 points from 38 matches in the Premier League", "'I have the impression that he was jealous, he took me for a rival,' he said\n\nFormer Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has sensationally claimed Pep Guardiola does not like picking African footballers.\n\nToure left City at the end of the season after eight glorious years. But in his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one Premier League start -- in the champions' meaningless final home fixture against Brighton.\n\nNow, in an interview with a French football magazine, the 35-year-old has made the extraordinary suggestion that he was being discriminated against by Guardiola on racial grounds.\n\nYaya Toure claims Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has a problem with players from Africa\n\nToure accused the Spaniard of doing everything to 'spoil' his last season at Manchester City\n\n'Pep did everything to spoil my last season. He was cruel with me,' said Toure. 'Do you really think he could've been like that with Andres Iniesta? It got to the point I asked myself if it was because of my colour. I am not the first. Other Barcelona players asked the question.\n\n'Maybe us Africans aren't always treated the same by certain people. When you see the problems (Pep) has often had with African players, everywhere he has been, I ask myself questions. He is too intelligent to be caught. He will never admit it. But the day he picks a team with five Africans in it, I promise I will send him a cake.'\n\nToure played under Guardiola at Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009 as well as two league titles and a Spanish Cup.\n\nHowever, the two men never looked at ease with each other when Guardiola succeeded Manuel Pellegrini at City two summers ago.\n\nToure was in and out of the City team in the 2016-17 season and was expected by many to leave last summer, especially after persistent criticism of Guardiola by his controversial agent Dimitri Seluk. Instead, Toure stayed, only to be frozen out last season.\n\n'I have the impression that he was jealous, he took me for a rival,' Toure said of Guardiola\n\nSpeaking to France Football magazine, Toure said: 'Pep wants to have obedient players who lick his hands. I do not like this relationship. I respect my coach but I am not his thing. Other players will never admit it publicly but some have already told me they ended up hating him. Because he manipulates and plays a lot with your head.'\n\nAFRICAN PLAYERS THAT HAVE PLAYED UNDER PEP GUARDIOLA\n\nBarcelona:\n\nSamuel Eto'o - Cameroon\n\nSeydou Keita - Mali\n\nYaya Toure - Ivory Coast\n\nBayern Munich:\n\nMedhi Benatia - Morocco\n\nManchester City:\n\nYaya Toure - Ivory Coast\n\nKelechi Iheanacho - Nigeria\n\nToure insisted he had no idea why he was not selected last season, claiming he asked the coaches for his stats and they were as good as or better than those of younger players who were picked ahead of him. 'I have the impression he (Guardiola) was jealous, he took me for a rival,' Toure said.\n\nToure played a starring role as City won Premier League titles in 2012 and 2014, featured in the FA Cup-winning team of 2011 and also played in two League Cup final wins.\n\nToure said: 'I want to be the one who breaks the Guardiola myth. Barcelona, he did not invent it. He just had the intelligence to adapt what Cruyff set up. Pep wants to be considered a genius. When I see him scratching his head to show that he thinks, it makes me laugh. It's comedy.'\n\nAnnouncing that Toure would leave in May, Guardiola said: 'This club became what it did because of players like Yaya. We are in thanks for what he has become.'\n\nToure captained the team for the final game against Brighton. He received a lifetime season ticket and a framed shirt with the number 316, his total appearances for the club.\n\nThe 34-year-old also received the mosaic of his FA Cup final winner against Stoke in the 2011 final. The original is on display next to a training pitch that has been named in his honour at the club's training ground.\n\nToure worked under Guardiola during playing spells at both Barcelona and Manchester City\n\nDespite all this, Toure seems bitter and accused Guardiola of being a hypocrite for praising him. Toure insisted it hurt him to leave City -- and their 'beautiful' fans. 'Pep did everything to spoil my last season. He stole my farewells with City,' said Toure.\n\nHe went on to say that he and the manager even 'looked at each other weirdly.' Toure added: 'He was spinning around me without saying anything, watching me, gauging me, but not talking. Yet he knows I speak Catalan, Spanish and English. It should be enough to communicate. Every time we passed each other, he seemed embarrassed. As if I made him self-conscious. As if, also, he understood I knew him perfectly.'\n\nGuardiola has worked with African players at each of the three clubs he has managed. He sold Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o in 2009 despite the fact the player had scored the opening goal in the Champions League final win over Manchester United.\n\nGuardiola said at the time: 'There is not a single major reason for this decision. It is a matter of feelings and sensations.'\n\nEto'o said last year that as a coach Guardiola had 'nothing to show me' but a year earlier had hailed the Catalan as 'still the best in the world'.\n\nManchester City declined to comment on Monday night.", "Seluk claims Toure will dedicate his performances next season to Guardiola\n\nYaya Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has warned Pep Guardiola of an 'African curse' following his client's sensational accusation that the Manchester City manager does not like picking African footballers.\n\nToure left City at the end of the season after eight trophy-laden years. But in his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one Premier League start.\n\nIn an interview with a French football magazine, the 35-year-old made the extraordinary suggestion that he was being discriminated against by Guardiola on racial grounds.\n\nUkrainian agent Dimitri Seluk is at the centre of a feud between Yaya Toure and Pep Guardiola\n\nToure claimed the Manchester City manager does not like picking African footballers\n\n'Pep did everything to spoil my last season.

But the day he picks a team with five Africans in it, I promise I will send him a cake.'\n\nNow, in an lengthy interview with Russian outlet Sport24, Seluk has warned the City boss of an 'African curse' and insisted Toure would be happy to play for another club in the Premier League's top six for a lowly wage of \u00a31 per-week.\n\n'Yaya knows Guardiola like no other,' he said. 'He worked with him both in Barcelona and in Manchester City. With all the desire, nothing good about the human qualities of Guardiola can be said.\n\n'God sees everything. As a man who acted with Yaya, the legend of the club, which under different pretexts did not give the opportunity to go on the field. He turned all Africa against himself, many African fans turned away from Manchester City.\n\n'And I'm sure that many African shamans in the future will not allow Guardiola to win the Champions League. This will be for Guardiola an African curse. Life will show whether I am right or not.'\n\nIn his final campaign his relationship with Guardiola deteriorated and he made only one start\n\nSeluk claimed Guardiola announced his arrival early to disrupt Manuel Pellegrini's final season\n\nToure played under Guardiola at Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009 as well as two league titles and a Spanish Cup. However, the two men never looked at ease with each other when Guardiola succeeded Manuel Pellegrini at City two summers ago.\n\nSeluk bemoaned how the Spaniard first came to the Etihad Stadium and claimed he announced his arrival early purely to disrupt Pellegrini's final season at the helm.\n\n'You can start with the fact that he came to Manchester City in a nasty manner. The transfer was announced at a time when Pellegrini, his co-worker in the coaching department, was still at the helm of the team,' he added.\n\n'Guardiola was afraid that Pellegrini would win the championship and other tournaments that season, as he did before he came to Bayern Munich, when Jupp Heynckes won all that is possible. Guardiola could not repeat the achievements of Heynckes, being the next three years at the helm of the best German club, which without Guardiola again leads and wins.\n\n'What did Guardiola achieve? In two years he won the same as Mancini or Pellegrini. And Pellegrini reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, and Guardiola - not yet. Manchester City has now extended the contract with him for three years.\n\n'I bet that Guardiola will not win the Champions League during this time, no matter how much money he has spent, but he likes to do it. When only \u00a3200million is spent on the line of defence, when money is not counted...\n\n'Perhaps, many will say that this is the style of Guardiola, that he plays enchanting football. Only when you buy all the best players in the world, it's much easier than, for example, in the case of (Claudio) Ranieri, who won the Premier League with Leicester.'\n\nSeluk insisted the Toure could still be of use to other members of the Premier League's top six\n\nToure's agent has promised his client will prove Guardiola wrong in England next season\n\nAs a free agent, Seluk insisted the veteran could still be of use to the other members of the Premier League's top six and claimed next season will be focused on proving Guardiola wrong.\n\n'Now Yaya has many offers from different countries, where they are ready to pay a lot of money, but we decided to dedicate the next season to Guardiola. And to prove and show the fans of Manchester City that Yaya is not finished with football. He is full of energy and wants to play this season in England,' he said.\n\n'At a time when huge sums are being spent in England for the purchase of football players, I officially declare that Yaya is ready to move as a free agent to any English club in the top six with a salary of \u00a31 a week - but for certain successes to make a bonus system.\n\n'I believe that a player like Yaya would not harm Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Liverpool. Yaya - the winner. And never before has a top footballer with leadership qualities harmed any club, especially when it is not necessary to pay for it.'\n\nManchester City declined to comment on Monday night.", "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has emphatically refuted Yaya Toure's allegations that he favours white players, branding the midfielder's comments 'lies'.\n\nToure left City at the end of the season following eight hugely successful years but he brewed up a storm earlier this week by claiming in an interview with France Football that Guardiola does not like picking African players.\n\nKevin De Bruyne quickly leapt to Guardiola's defence and now the City manager has himself moved to quash Toure's serious allegations.\n\nPep Guardiola has emphatically denied Yaya Toure's allegations, labelling them 'lies'\n\nIn an interview with France Football, Toure claimed Guardiola does not like picking Africans\n\n'They were lies and he knows it,' he told TV3 in Spain.

They named Harry Kane their big winner on Thursday night and the Tottenham striker is our big winner here too.\n\nHow else to measure who is the best leading actor but by goals? The England striker is the Premier League's top scorer with 24, one ahead of Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.\n\nOnce labelled a one-season wonder, he has now scored at least 20 goals for the fourth year in succession. Oscars winners get a golden gong but Kane is heading for another Golden Boot.\n\nHarry Kane is the Premier League's top goalscorer this season so far with 24 strikes to his name\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Kevin De Bruyne, Man City PREMIER LEAGUE ASSISTS 2017-18\n\n14 - Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\n\n11 - Leroy Sane (Man City)\n\n9 - Paul Pogba (Man Utd)\n\n8 - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool); Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Arsenal); David Silva (Man City)\n\nKevin De Bruyne is fighting to be crowned the Premier League's Player of the Year and has Kane and Salah as competition. For now, he can at least put this individual award on his mantelpiece.\n\nThe Manchester City midfielder has been one of the stand-out stars this season in a team that is being debated as one of the greatest to ever grace the English top flight. De Bruyne has managed 14 assists, three ahead of team-mate Leroy Sane.\n\nThe Belgian faces his former club Chelsea on Sunday and can show them what they let go for only \u00a318million.\n\nKevin De Bruyne has been one of the stand-out stars in an incredible Manchester City side\n\nBEST DRAMATIC ACTOR: Dele Alli, Tottenham\n\nTottenham host Huddersfield at Wembley Stadium on Saturday and it brings to mind the last time these two met - in a 4-0 away win at the John Smith's Stadium.\n\nDuring that tie, Dele Alli received a booking for diving as he threw himself to the ground under a challenge by goalkeeper Jonas Lossl. That was one of two yellow cards he has been shown for diving in the Premier League this season - more than any other player.\n\nEven last week at Selhurst Park, Alli was criticised for going down after a coming together with Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.

After their easy 3-0 win at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday, Manchester City are 30 points ahead of Arsenal.\n\nEven second-placed Manchester United are 16 points adrift. Guardiola has spent significantly and City are now a class above. Chelsea's Antonio Conte, who won the title last season, labelled them 'unstoppable' ahead of their clash on Sunday.\n\nCity are the league's top scorers, top shooters, top chance creators and top passers.

Sam Allardyce's Everton, Paul Lambert's Stoke and Javi Gracia's Watford have each used 29 players in the Premier League this season.\n\nThose clubs like to chop, change and edit their starting line-ups, and all three have even changed their head coaches lately.\n\nAllardyce only took charge of Everton in November while Lambert and Gracia were appointed by Stoke and Watford in January.\n\nThe ultimate editors! It is the exact opposite at the other end of the table. Bournemouth's Eddie Howe has been in charge for six years and counting now and has used only 21 players in total.\n\nBEST SCORE: Wayne Rooney, Everton (v West Ham, November 2017)\n\nThe award for a goal that was scored in a beautiful way. Take a bow, Wayne Rooney. 'It was one of the best goals I've ever scored,' Rooney said.\n\n'I hit it as well as I've ever hit a football. To make it my first Everton hat-trick was special. It was a perfect moment.'\n\nJoe Hart came racing out of his goal to try to clear. He booted the ball into the opponent's half but only to Rooney, who shaped his body and shot first time left-footed from 58 yards.\n\nIt went directly into the gaping goal despite Angelo Ogbonna's attempts to handball it out of the way. An exquisite strike by the Evertonian. This turned out to be the last straw for David Moyes.\n\nThe next week, Hart was dropped for Adrian and the ex-England No 1 has not appeared in the Premier League since. Oops.\n\nWayne Rooney's strike from fully 58 yards was a thing of beauty for Everton at Goodison Park\n\nBEST FOREIGN FILM: Watford MOST FOREIGN PLAYERS USED\n\n21 - Watford\n\n20 - Chelsea\n\n19 - Man City\n\n18 - Arsenal\n\n17 - Man Utd, Tottenham\n\nOne of the first questions asked of Gracia at his Watford unveiling in January was how would he handle overseeing such a diverse squad?\n\nThe Spaniard explained how English would be their primary language - Gracia had previously managed Rubin Kazan in Russia and used it there to communicate with his players.\n\nHe has had an impact, even if an inconsistent one. In February, Watford beat Chelsea 4-1, then lost 2-0 to West Ham, then got the better of Everton 1-0.\n\nThe Hornets have used 21 players who are not British or Irish this season - more than any other Premier League side. Chelsea are close on 20 but the award of best foreign film goes to Watford.\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY: Fabian Delph, Man City (v Crystal Palace, September 2017)\n\nFabian Delph scored a goal to make Guardiola proud in September. Not because he banged it into the top corner, but because he finished off a move typical of the former Barcelona man's mantra.\n\nIt was Manchester City's fifth goal of the day against Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium and one that was certainly easy on the eye. City won possession and 31 passes later, Delph scored his screamer.\n\nEvery outfield player was involved in the build-up. It was Guardiola-esque. That was the most passes before a Premier League strike this season. City even occupy three of the top five positions. They have perfected the art of putting together a goal.\n\nTOP FIVE MOST PASSES BEFORE A PREMIER LEAGUE GOAL\n\n31 - Fabian Delph, Man City (v Crystal Palace, September 2017)\n\n28 - Sergio Aguero, Man City (v Bournemouth, December 2017)\n\n24 - Jeff Hendrick, Burnley (v Everton, October 2017)\n\n21 - Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool (v Bournemouth, December 2017)\n\n20 - Raheem Sterling, Man City (v West Brom, October 2017)\n\nBEST NEWCOMER: Ederson, Man City PREMIER LEAGUE CLEAN SHEETS\n\n15 - David De Gea (Man Utd)\n\n13 - Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea)\n\n12 - Ederson (Man City); Hugo Lloris (Tottenham)\n\n9 - Nick Pope (Burnley); Petr Cech (Arsenal)\n\nRicharlison might have had a chance of this award had he continued the form he showed earlier in the season.\n\nSalah was not included in our list of nominees, given he is not new to England. And let's be honest, Chelsea's \u00a340m Tiemoue Bakayoko never had a chance in this category. Neither did Swansea's Renato Sanches, the 20-year-old on loan from Bayern Munich.\n\nThe goalkeeper position was one Guardiola wanted to fix and he did that.\n\nEderson was signed for \u00a335m and has had an impact - he was one of the chief culprits in the Old Trafford bust-up after all!\n\nThe 24-year-old has not kept the most clean sheets with 12 - Thibaut Courtois has kept 13 and David De Gea 15 - but he does get the nod as our best newcomer.\n\nEderson has had a massive impact at the back for City in one of the positions they needed to fix\n\nBEST PICTURE: Liverpool 4-3 Man City\n\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool brought Manchester City's dream of an invincible season to an end at Anfield in emphatic fashion.\n\nThe Reds had the runaway leaders rattled in Merseyside.It went from 1-1 to 4-1 in a nine-minute three-goal blitz with Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Salah all on target. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain put in a man of the match performance too.\n\nThis was something of a statement from Liverpool in their first game following the sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.\n\nCity set up a tense finish with late strikes from Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan, prompting a few cries of: 'They couldn't, could they?' They didn't but what a watch this was. Best picture.\n\nLiverpool brought Manchester City's dream of an invincible season to an end at Anfield", "Manchester United are lining up bids for Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski and Tottenham Hotspur defender Toby Alderweireld according to one report today. But while a move for the Belgium international centre-back could be on the cards closer to the transfer deadline the chances are slim of United making a successful bid for the Polish striker.\n\nLewandowski has been linked with an exit from Bayern ever since he appointed super-agent and United negotiator Pini Zahavi as his representative earlier this year. The Independent claims Bayern are open to selling the 29-year-old although that assertion goes against the public statements made by the Bundesliga champions.\n\nBayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has said that he fully expects Lewandowski to still be at the German club next season and that they won't entertain any sale.\n\nIn any case, United would face competition from Real Madrid and Chelsea for the Pole. Lewandowski turns 30 next month so this represents his final chance to make the move to Manchester United.\n\nUnited are also interested in Bayern midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The Red Devils were linked with the Spain international in 2013 when he looked set to leave Barcelona. But they missed out to Bayern for a player who has won five Bundesliga titles in his five years at the German club.\n\nBut Alcantara prefers a move back to Barcelona despite the La Liga side signing Brazilian midfielder Arthur.\n\nBayern are refusing to put a price on the 27-year-old while Barca are eyeing up other possibilities.\n\nUnited have already been in talks over Alderweireld but the two clubs remain at least around \u00a320million apart in their valuations. Spurs are looking for around \u00a370million for a player who has one year left on his contract but for whom they have an option to extend his current deal by a year. However, a release clause of \u20ac30million (\u00a326million) kicks in once that option has been triggered.\n\nSpurs chairman Daniel Levy likes to engage in brinksmanship, so unless United throw in the towel this one could go right up to the 9 August transfer deadline.", "Get Manchester United FC updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nJose Mourinho has suggested Anthony Martial will stay at Manchester United beyond the Premier League transfer deadline.\n\nMartal's agent Philippe Lamboley said last month the Frenchman wants to leave United but Mourinho has a paucity of attacking options available for the pre-season tour after Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Romelu Lukaku reached the semi-finals of the World Cup. The trio are due to enjoy a minimum three-week break.\n\nMourinho's selection quandary up front was compounded by Alexis Sanchez's inability to travel to the United States due to visa issues. If Sanchez is refused entry during the five-match tour then the only friendly he could figure in is at Bayern Munich on August 5, which is five days before United's league opener against Leicester.\n\nUnited manager Mourinho is planning to start Juan Mata, Sanchez and Martial in that Friday night fixture, which could ward off lingering interest from Tottenham before the August 9 deadline for Premier League clubs.\n\n\"Hopefully he [Sanchez] join us later,\" Mourinho said. \"Because it would be important at least to work with Mata, Alexis, Martial, which we think are the players we have in attack for the start of the season.\n\n\"No Lukaku, no Lingard, no Marcus Rashford, so if Alexis is not working with us for 15 or 20 days it will be very bad.\"\n\nUnited gave Tottenham short shrift following an enquiry for Martial last month and the clubs briefly discussed a possible swap deal involving Toby Alderweireld. While United could prevent Martial from joining a domestic rival, the Fifa transfer deadline is on August 31.\n\nThe MEN revealed in May United had no intention of selling Martial, 22, and would only relent if he agitated. Despite his agent's comments, Martial has focused on preparing for United's new campaign after he was omitted from Didier Deschamps' World Cup-winning France squad.\n\nMartial has a year left on his United contract but the club has the option to extend it by a year until 2020.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now", "Melbourne Victory are all but assured of securing the services of Japanese legend Keisuke Honda for at least next season, while the defending A-League champions have signed experienced German centre-back Georg Niedermeier.\n\nHonda's agent and brother Hiroyuki Honda has been in talks with Victory and Football Federation Australia for some months, and The Age understands the only way the deal will break down is if there are complications with the terms of the multi-million dollar marquee contract.\n\nThe money will likely come from Victory and from the FFA's marquee fund.\n\nNiedermeier, 32, played his youth soccer at Bayern Munich.

They met on the set of Wanderlust, which came out in 2012\n\n'He found he was just happier living on his own in New York without her,' said the source.\n\n'Even when Justin was in L.A. staying with Jen he would spend most of the time in the guest house' at their Bel Air mansion.\n\n'He would play music and hang out. He just felt more comfortable there than in the main house with Jen.'\n\nShe did what she could: The TV vet tried to look edgy in black for him, but it must have exhausted her; in April 2017\n\nMaybe he should date her: Justin has a lot more in common with Brad Pitt's ex Angelina Jolie\n\nPeople added, 'For many months they tried to make it work. They even had therapy.'\n\nThey also had to get past that they could not start a family together.\n\nThe source claimed that early on in their relationship the two tried to have babies.\n\n'When Jen met Justin, she had almost given up on the idea that she would have kids,' an insider said.\n\n'They wanted to have a baby, but it didn't work out.'\n\nThe real Jen: Beachy, blonde and tan in LA in 2016\n\nA better fit?

Neither one has yet to file for divorce.\n\nIt was also said: 'They couldn't find common ground that made them both happy. It became exhausting and frustrating,' said a source.\n\nBut don't look for Jennifer to start looking for a new romance.\n\nAs far as seeing other men, 'she isn't a fan of dating, and she never was. She always found dating awkward and unpleasant.'\n\nAnd she is not looking forward to how people will be looking into her love life.\n\n'She hates all the media attention that she knows she will get now. But she is a big believer in falling in love and spending her life with a partner that loves sharing hers.'\n\nBut the Friends vet 'seems okay' now that she is single again.\n\nCan't miss that: The 49-year-old flashed the huge rock at the Oscars in Hollywood in 2013\n\n'She has an amazing life that she loves and is very grateful for.

While the installation of the charging stations is still ongoing, BMW has confirmed that they will soon avail its fully-electric vehicle, the i3, and that the hybrid and sporty i8 has been ordered by a client in the country.\n\nAn electric vehicle, also called an EV, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.\n\nEVs first came into existence in the mid-19th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Modern internal combustion engines have been the dominant propulsion method for motor vehicles for almost 100 years, but electric power has remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as trains and smaller vehicles of all types. In the 21st century, EVs saw a resurgence due to technological developments, and an increased focus on renewable energy. Government incentives to increase adoptions were introduced, including in the United States and the European Union. However, locally, a lack of charging infrastructure has delayed the introduction of EVs.\n\nWhile global automotive powerhouses, such Volvo and Volkwagen, have already indicate that they will soon manufacture only EVs, local dealerships have bemoaned the lack of charging infrastructure which they say is delaying the introduction of these revolutionary vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, half of young people in the United Kingdom would like to own an electric car, compared with just a quarter of their parents, a survey suggests. The research comes from motoring group the Automobile Association (AA), which says myths about electric vehicles are putting off many drivers. The AA says this matters because cleaning up air pollution and tackling climate change both depend on mass acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs). However, young people seem to be more accepting of the technology than older people.\n\nBut too many still hold needless fears, the AA says.\n\nIt comes as the British government has announced a target for 50 percent of all new vehicle sales to be in the ultra-low emissions category by 2030. The opinions were revealed in an AA/Populus poll of 10,293 drivers.\n\nIn the UK there are already more than 16 000 charging points at 5 800 locations and 340 points added monthly. Most drivers will charge their car at home. Also, EV range is improving all the time. Several models have a 250-mile-plus range. Some 95 percent of car journeys are under 25 miles.\n\nRapid chargers which could charge an EV to around 80 percent range in around 30 minutes are on the way - ideal for \"filling stations\".\n\nThe AA's president Edmund King said: \"The range, charging speed and charging point infrastructure are all on the increase. There needs to be a more concerted effort by us all to sell the benefits of electric vehicles.\n\n\"Drivers will also need to change their fuelling habits with the majority charging their EVs at night (at home) and then at their destinations.\n\n\"Ultimately outstanding, affordable, stylish EVs with a decent range will sell themselves. Massive savings can already be made on running and service costs, as well as the tax benefits.\"\n\n\"The younger generation in particular are ready to embrace the electric revolution.\" - Additional reporting by BBC News", "Rolls-Royce said that it plans to create a flying taxi prototype within the next 18 months (AFP)\n\nAutonomous vehicles have only just begun to navigate our streets and already the world's innovators are setting their sights on the next big transportation trend.\n\nFlying taxis.\n\nUber plans to create a network of flying taxis in Dubai and the Dallas area by the year 2020.

Once the craft reaches its cruising height, its vehicle's propellers would fold away and the craft would rely on several rear propellers for thrust.\n\nAn attendee watches a digital display of a Rolls-Royce concept hybrid-electric air vehicle at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain on Monday, July 16, 2018 (Bloomberg)\n\nRolls-Royce said the vehicle would fill a niche created by overtaxed transportation systems in increasingly crowded cities. Watson told Agence France-Presse that he envisions an electric version of the vehicle moving passengers around a city but a hybrid propulsion system carrying passengers longer distances, such as between London and Paris. The company noted that the vehicle could be adapted for military purposes as well, though no detail was provided.\n\n\"Electrification is an exciting and inescapable trend across industrial technology markets and while the move to more electric propulsion will be gradual for us, it will ultimately be a revolution,\" Watson said.\n\nDavid Stewart - an aviation and aerospace adviser and partner at Oliver Wyman - told AFP that the aerospace environmental industry is reacting to a push to become less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\n\"I think that electrical propulsion is a potential disruptor to the way things are powered,\" Stewart said. \"We are quite a long way for electrical power to be a replacement for kerosene, but never say never.\"", "I buy what ever brand is on offer at the motor factors I use, providing it is the exact grade and ACEA spec needed.\n\nExactly this.

She dated Jason Derulo for three years until 2014, with their split turning bitter after she claimed he had actually leased a BMW car that he said he had bought for her. Jordin then started dating Sage the Gemini in 2015, but the pair called time on their romance in February 2016, after nine months together.\n\nHowever, it seems Jordin has found 'the one' in Dana.

Now, a new report from Road & Track suggests that Toyota's new sports car additionally will offer a cheaper four-cylinder variant with a 2.0-liter turbo four that also comes from Bavaria.\n\nThe intel comes from an internal document from the transmission supplier ZF, which enumerates various powertrain details for the new Supra, code-named A90. It shows that BMW's ubiquitous B48 turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four will be found in the Toyota, producing 262 horsepower. It'll be paired with ZF's 8HP eight-speed automatic transmission, the one found in myriad automotive applications; the same transmission will be offered on the six-cylinder Supra, which uses a 335-hp version of BMW's B58 3.0-liter turbo six. Supra chief engineer Tetsuya Tada also confirmed the four-cylinder option to R&T, saying it will be less expensive than the six, naturally.\n\nWe're still not sure whether or not the new Supra will offer a manual transmission in addition to the ZF auto. Various rumors have swirled about this crucial piece of equipment, but since the manual likely wouldn't be made by ZF, these documents don't shed any more light. We'll hold out hope, although the fact that the Z4 roadster will exclusively use the ZF automatic with essentially the same engines doesn't bode well.\n\nToyota Supra: Our Best Look at the Production ModelHow the NASCAR Toyota Supra Compares with the Production CarA Visual History of the Toyota Supra\n\nExpect to learn more about the production Supra over the coming months.

That was followed by a relationship with drug kingpin Tony Mokbel, during which the pair had a daughter who was born in Greece in 2006, at which time Mokbel was on the run.\n\nMs McGuire also reportedly had a fling with notorious former bikie Toby Mitchell.\n\nShe once tearfully admitted: 'You can't help who you fall in love with'.\n\nWhile some of her lovers spent time behind bars, Ms McGuire was herself jailed for trafficking $800,000 worth of ecstasy in 1998.\n\nHer daughter Brittany, now 22, is the owner of a hair salon in Port Melbourne and regularly posts photos online of a glamorous life, much like that her mother often enjoyed.\n\nFour years ago Brittany found herself before the courts, pleading guilty to speeding at 157km/h in a 100km/h zone.\n\nFrom Mark Moran to Tony Mokbel, Danielle McGuire (pictured) was often on the arm of some of Melbourne's most violent figures throughout the underworld war\n\nMs McGuire's daughter Brittany (pictured) is just as glamorous as her mother, who went to Greece with Mokbel in 2006 and gave birth to their child\n\nThe 22-year-old, who owns a hair salon in Port Melbourne, has had a number of brushes with the law in recent years including a speeding offence in 2014\n\nAmelia and Ellie Gangitano - daughters of Alphonse Gangitano and his wife Virginia\n\nFeared gangster Alphonse Gangitano (pictured) was just the second person to die in Melbourne's gangland war\n\nAlphonse Gangitano, better known as the 'Black Prince of Lygon Street', ruled the streets with an iron fist as a member of the Carlton Crew in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nAside from being a fight promoter, nightclub owner and gambler, his love of extreme violence also saw him take a shine to the role of debt collector.\n\nHis fellow Carlton Crew member and friend Mick Gatto said he was simply stunned by Gangitano's behaviour on several occasions.\n\nClose associate Jason Moran - who is believed to have orchestrated Gangitano's death - was also recorded talking about the mobster's love of violence.\n\n'He's a f***ing lulu... if you smash five pool cues and an iron bar over someone's head... you're a f***ing lulu,' Moran said.\n\nBefore he was shot dead inside his home in January 1998, Gangitano was raking in an estimated $200,000-a-month.\n\nBut while some children of the Melbourne underworld's most notorious figures have followed their parents into trouble, Gangitano's daughters Amelia and Ellie have not.\n\nAmelia and her partner Tristan are understood to be engaged, and recently welcomed a daughter.\n\nHis other daughter Ellie has forged a career as an actress.

Consequently, the year-over-year growth of revenue and profit in 2018 will be impacted by the new policies.\n\nAs already announced in SAP's Q4 2017 Quarterly Statement, the Company expects the full year 2018 impact of the policy change on revenue, operating expenses and profit to be as follows:\n\nThe new revenue recognition policies are described in our Half Year Report. Details regarding the IFRS 15 impact in the second quarter and first six months can be found in the section 'Impact of Changes in Accounting Policies' in this Quarterly Statement.\n\nAmbition 2020\n\nLooking beyond 2018, SAP is updating its 2020 ambition. This update reflects the strong momentum in SAP's cloud business, the acquisition of Callidus Software as well as a more challenging currency environment compared to 2017.\n\nSAP now expects 2020 non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue in a range of \u20ac8.2 - \u20ac8.7 billion (previously: \u20ac8.0 - \u20ac8.5 billion).\n\nSAP continues to expect:\n\nThe updated ambition is based on estimated average 2018 currencies, assuming the current foreign exchange environment prevails until year-end. The previous ambition was based on average 2017 currencies. The change in currency assumptions negatively impacts the cloud subscriptions and support revenue ambition by approximately -\u20ac0.35 billion, the total revenue ambition by approximately -\u20ac1.0 billion and the operating profit ambition by approximately -\u20ac0.4 billion. These negative impacts are now included in the updated 2020 ambition.\n\nThe full Q2 2018 Quarterly Statement can be downloaded from http://www.sap.com/investors/sap-2018-q2-statement\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOn April 5, 2018, SAP acquired Callidus Software Inc. and changed the structure of the Applications, Technology & Services segment. The Callidus business was combined with our existing customer experience activities into a new business unit called 'SAP Customer Experience'. This new unit, which qualifies as an operating segment (called 'Customer Experience'), comprises on premise and cloud-based products that run front office functions across the customer experience.

That's why we raised our 2018 outlook and 2020 ambition.\" - Luka Mucic, CFO\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nSecond Quarter 2018\n\nNew cloud bookings1 grew 24% (29% at constant currencies) in the second quarter and reached \u20ac421 million. Cloud subscriptions and support revenue grew 30% year over year to \u20ac1.21 billion (IFRS), up 40% (non-IFRS at constant currencies).2 Software revenue was down 9% year over year to \u20ac996 million (IFRS), down 5% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). New cloud and software license order entry3 grew 12% at constant currencies year over year in the second quarter. Cloud and software revenue grew 4% year over year to \u20ac4.94 billion (IFRS), up 10% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Total revenue grew 4% year over year to \u20ac6.00 billion (IFRS), up 10% (non-IFRS at constant currencies).\n\nSAP's rapidly expanding cloud business together with solid growth in support revenue continued to drive the share of more predictable revenue. The total of cloud subscriptions & support revenue and software support revenue as a percentage of total revenue grew 2 percentage points year-over-year to 66% in the second quarter.\n\nSecond quarter operating profit was up 13% year over year to \u20ac1.04 billion (IFRS), up 12% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). As announced in January 2018, the Company expects a positive revenue and profit impact from the adoption of IFRS 15 in 2018. In the second quarter, this positive impact on SAP's operating profit was around \u20ac54 million. Earnings per share increased 8% to \u20ac0.60 (IFRS) and increased 5% to \u20ac0.98 (non-IFRS).\n\nOperating cash flow for the first six months was \u20ac2.99 billion, down 15% year over year. The decrease in operating cash flow was mainly due to timing of stock based compensation payments, currency headwinds as well as higher tax and insurance payments. Free cash flow decreased 25% year over year to \u20ac2.17 billion. Free cash flow was also lower due to the previously announced additional CapEx for 2018. At the end of the second quarter, net liquidity was -\u20ac2.97 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSAP S/4HANA\n\nWith SAP's next generation ERP S/4HANA, customers can massively simplify their IT landscape, turn real-time data into actions and reinvent their business models for the digital economy across every industry.\n\nS/4HANA adoption grew to more than 8,900 customers, up 41% year over year. In the second quarter, approximately 600 additional customers signed up of which approximately 40% were net new.\n\nS/4HANA continues to be selected by world-class global companies, including McDonalds (China) in the quarter. A growing number of companies are now adopting S/4HANA in the Cloud. TechnipFMC, China Sports Lemon, and Spirit Airlines chose S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nSAP C/4HANA (Customer Experience)\n\nSAP's C/4HANA solutions serve a wide range of industries across both B2C and B2B and enable businesses to manage their entire front office: marketing, sales, commerce, service, customer data cloud - seamlessly and in real-time.\n\nIn the second quarter, SAP's C/4HANA customer experience solutions achieved high double-digit year-over-year growth in new cloud bookings and total revenue in the SAP Customer Experience segment was up 65% to \u20ac242 million at constant currencies.\n\nWhirlpool, Deutsche Telekom, and Novartis were among those that chose SAP's C/4HANA solutions this quarter.\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\nWith SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Fieldglass, SAP delivers total workforce management across both permanent and contingent labor. The SAP SuccessFactors suite is localized for 92 countries and 42 languages.\n\nSAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, which is the flagship of SAP's HCM offering, ended the quarter with more than 2,600 customers and scored numerous competitive wins including BMW, Telecom Argentina, Shiseido, and MG Motors India.\n\nSAP Leonardo\n\nWith SAP Leonardo SAP delivers powerful innovation by bringing together deep process and industry expertise, advanced design thinking methodology and cutting edge software capabilities such as IoT, Big Data, Machine Learning, Analytics, and Blockchain.

SAP Business Network is the largest commerce platform in the world with approximately $2.4 trillion4 in global commerce annually transacted in more than 180 countries.\n\nIn the second quarter, total revenue in the SAP Business Network segment was up 21% to \u20ac688 million at constant currencies year over year. Bosch-Siemens Hausger\u00e4te, and Avianca chose SAP's Business Network Solutions in the second quarter.\n\nRegional Revenue Performance in the Second Quarter 2018\n\nSAP had a very strong performance in the EMEA region with cloud and software revenue increasing 10% (IFRS) and 12% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Cloud subscriptions and support revenue was strong and grew by 40% (IFRS) and 46% (non-IFRS at constant currencies) with Germany and the UK being highlights. In addition, SAP had strong double-digit software revenue growth in the UK, and the Middle East and Germany had another strong software revenue quarter with solid single digit growth.\n\nThe Company had a solid performance in the Americas region with a significant currency headwind.

The previous range was \u20ac4.95 billion - \u20ac5.15 billion at constant currencies. Non-IFRS cloud and software revenue is now expected to be in a range of \u20ac21.025 - \u20ac21.250 billion at constant currencies (2017: \u20ac19.55 billion), up 7.5% - 8.5% at constant currencies. The previous range was \u20ac20.85 - \u20ac21.25 billion at constant currencies. Non-IFRS total revenue is now expected to be in a range of \u20ac24.975 billion - \u20ac25.300 billion at constant currencies (2017: \u20ac23.46 billion), up 6.0% - 7.5% at constant currencies. The previous range was \u20ac24.80 billion - \u20ac25.30 billion at constant currencies. Non-IFRS operating profit is now expected to be in a range of \u20ac7.400 billion - \u20ac7.500 billion at constant currencies (2017: \u20ac6.77 billion), up 9.0% - 11.0% at constant currencies. The previous range was \u20ac7.35 billion - \u20ac7.50 billion at constant currencies.\n\nWhile SAP's full-year 2018 business outlook is at constant currencies, actual currency reported figures are expected to be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations as the Company progresses through the year. See the table below for the Q3 and FY 2018 expected currency impacts.\n\nExpected Currency Impact Based on June 2018 Level for the Rest of the Year\n\nIn percentage points\n\nQ3\n\nFY\n\nCloud subscriptions and support\n\n1 to -1pp\n\n-4 to -6pp\n\nCloud and software\n\n1 to -1pp\n\n-2 to -4pp\n\nOperating profit\n\n1 to -1pp\n\n-2 to -4pp\n\nIFRS 15 Impact\n\nAs of January 1, 2018, SAP changed several of its accounting policies to adopt IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'. Under the IFRS 15 adoption method chosen by SAP prior years are not restated to conform to the new policies. Consequently, the year-over-year growth of revenue and profit in 2018 will be impacted by the new policies.\n\nAs already announced in SAP's Q4 2017 Quarterly Statement, the Company expects the full year 2018 impact of the policy change5 on revenue, operating expenses and profit to be as follows:\n\nRevenues are expected to experience a benefit of substantially less than \u20ac0.1 billion with most of the difference resulting from exercises of customer software purchase options granted in prior years which result in software revenue. Operating expenses are expected to benefit, in cost of sales and marketing, in the amount of approximately \u20ac0.2 billion from higher capitalization of sales commissions. Other policy changes will weigh on operating expenses with an additional cost of revenue of substantially less than \u20ac0.1 billion. The above-mentioned effects will result in a net positive impact on operating profit of approximately \u20ac0.2 billion.\n\nThe new revenue recognition policies are described in our Half Year Report. Details regarding the IFRS 15 impact in the second quarter and first six months can be found in the section 'Impact of Changes in Accounting Policies' in this Quarterly Statement.\n\nAmbition 2020\n\nLooking beyond 2018, SAP is updating its 2020 ambition. This update reflects the strong momentum in SAP's cloud business, the acquisition of Callidus Software as well as a more challenging currency environment compared to 2017.\n\nSAP now expects 2020 non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue in a range of \u20ac8.2 - \u20ac8.7 billion (previously: \u20ac8.0 - \u20ac8.5 billion).\n\nSAP continues to expect:\n\n\u20ac28 - \u20ac29 billion non-IFRS total revenue \u20ac8.5 - \u20ac9.0 billion non-IFRS operating profit The share of more predictable revenue (defined as the total of cloud subscriptions & support revenue and software support revenue) in a range of 70% - 75%.\n\nThe updated ambition is based on estimated average 2018 currencies, assuming the current foreign exchange environment prevails until year-end. The previous ambition was based on average 2017 currencies. The change in currency assumptions negatively impacts the cloud subscriptions and support revenue ambition by approximately -\u20ac0.35 billion, the total revenue ambition by approximately -\u20ac1.0 billion and the operating profit ambition by approximately -\u20ac0.4 billion. These negative impacts are now included in the updated 2020 ambition.\n\nThe full Q2 2018 Quarterly Statement can be downloaded from http://www.sap.com/investors/sap-2018-q2-statement\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOn April 5, 2018, SAP acquired Callidus Software Inc. and changed the structure of the Applications, Technology & Services segment. The Callidus business was combined with our existing customer experience activities into a new business unit called 'SAP Customer Experience'. This new unit, which qualifies as an operating segment (called 'Customer Experience'), comprises on premise and cloud-based products that run front office functions across the customer experience. The company has retrospectively adjusted its revenue and results for the Applications, Technology & Services segment to reflect these changes. For further information regarding changes in SAP's segment structure, see Note 14 in our consolidated Half-Year Report.\n\nAll numbers for the SAP group and the Customer Experience segment include Callidus revenues and profits from April 5, 2018 onwards. Numbers for periods before the acquisition do not include Callidus' revenues or profits.\n\nFor a more detailed description of all of SAP's non-IFRS measures and their limitations as well as our constant currency and free cash flow figures see Explanation of Non-IFRS Measures online.\n\nWebcast\n\nSAP senior management will host a financial analyst conference call at 2:00 PM (CET) / 1:00 PM (GMT) / 8:00 AM (Eastern) / 5:00 AM (Pacific).

Consequently, orders to renew existing contracts are not included in this metric. The order amount must be committed. Consequently, due to their pay-per-use nature, business network transaction fees which do not include a committed minimum consumption are not reflected in the bookings metric (e.g. SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass transaction-based fees). Amounts included in the measures are generally annualized (annualized contract value ACV).\n\n2 For the second quarter 2018, Callidus contributed \u20ac50 million to SAP's Non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue at constant currencies. The Callidus acquisition was closed on April 5th 2018.\n\n3 New cloud and software license order entry is the total of new cloud order entry and software license order entry. The new cloud order entry metric is identical to the new cloud bookings metric defined above except that it considers the total contract value (TCV) of the orders where the new cloud bookings metric considers the orders' annualized contract value (ACV). Software license order entry is the total of all orders received in a given period the revenue from which is expected to be classified as software license revenue. The support services commonly sold with the software licenses are not included in the software license order entry metric.\n\n4 SAP Business Network commerce is the total commerce transacted on the Ariba, Concur and Fieldglass Networks in the trailing 12 months.

This was around two hours before Anissia jumped to her death.\n\nMinutes before committing suicide, Anissia messaged her friend once again, saying that while Mayank had let her out of the room, she had decided to end her life. \"Mayank has driven me to it,\" Anissia said in the last text the air hostess sent to her friend.\n\nMayank has been arrested by the Delhi Police, which is investigating Anissia Batra's suicide. Anissia's family has accused the software engineer of repeated domestic assault and of dowry harassment. The family has also demanded that Mayank's parents be arrested.\n\nAnissia Batra killed herself on the evening of July 13. Her father is a retired army officer who previously wrote to the Delhi Police accusing Mayank of repeatedly assaulting her daughter.\n\nI am going to kill myself today because Mayank has driven me to it... I can't repair what he has done to me\n\n- Anissia Batra's last message to friend\n\nIn his June 27 complaint, Major General RS Batra (retired) told the police that if anything were to happen to Anissia, Mayank and her in-laws would be responsible.\n\nAnissia's mother has made similar accusations, telling the police in her statement that Mayank had assaulted her daughter on the second day of the couple's honeymoon. Anissia and Mayank got married in February 2016.\n\nWHAT ANISSIA MESSAGED\n\nAround a month before she committed suicide, Anissia found out that Mayank was a divorcee. This, a police officer previously said, had upset her and had led to arguments between the couple.\n\nOn July 13, at 2:56 pm, Anissia sent a WhatsApp message to her friend: \"He [Mayank] has locked me inside room. Please call police. Please come if you can. I am locked up...\"\n\nA minute later, she sent another text: \"finally I got my phone, I am at N 116... I need help.. he [Mayank] is sitting outside guarding my room...\" Her friend responded, saying that she could not come right away but suggested the name of another friend who was present closer to Anissia and so, would reach the air hostess's home sooner.\n\nREAD | Next thing you'll see is my death: Anissia Batra texted husband minutes before suicide\n\nHowever, at 4:12 pm, minutes before committing suicide, Anissia seemed to have made up her mind: \"I am going to kill myself today because Mayank has driven me to it. He finally let me out but I can't repair what he has done to me.\"\n\nShe never got in touch with her friend again but is believed to have messaged her husband that she was about to end her life.\n\nMayank Singhvi is currently under judicial custody and police have said they plan to question his parents and perhaps his ex-wife. \"We will question his ex-wife to understand [his] behaviour, if required during the investigation.

Sales of aircraft like this helps Airbus generate \u00a31.7bn in UK tax revenues\n\nBut the threat was dismissed by Brexiteers who derided the claims as a renewed 'Project Fear' aimed at undermining the mission to leave the EU.\n\nTthe impact could go wider with an estimated 110,000 jobs at risk in companies supplying the European aircraft maker.\n\nAirbus, which generates \u00a31.7billion in tax revenues, said it would 'reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country' if Britain left the single market and customs union without a transition agreement.\n\nJohn Longworth, Co-Chair of Leave Means Leave said: 'The latest scare story from Airbus screams of more Project Fear.\n\n'The French-run Airbus is a classic multi-national business that clearly doesn't care about the UK as we embark on a new post-Brexit future, because it is intrinsically wrapped up in the EU and trying to undermine the UK Government's negotiating position.\n\nHow big is Airbus in the UK? Giant employs 14,000 people across 25 sites\n\nAirbus employs around 14,000 people in the UK across 25 sites.\n\nIt is the largest commercial aerospace company in the UK, and every single wing of an Airbus aircraft is manufactured here.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by Oxford Economics, Airbus' global operations supported a \u00a37.8bn contribution to the UK economy in 2015.\n\nAt sites in Broughton, Flintshire, and Filton, Gloucestershire, they manufacture wings and landing gear for its commerical aircraft.\n\nAccording to its website, it is the 'biggest civil aerospace exporter' in the UK.\n\nIt also it the biggest supplier of helicopters in the country, is the UK's largest space company, and according to its website is the 'leading commercial provider of military satellite communications.\n\nIt it also the biggest supplier of large aircraft to the Royal Air Force, and says on its website that it is a 'world leader in cyber security.'\n\nEach year Airbus spends in excess of \u00a35billion with UK suppliers.\n\n'Airbus are claiming that they might relocate out of the UK because of uncertainty, but if we leave the customs union nothing will change as tariffs on aeronautical products are zero. They are also claiming that they may move production to countries outside the EU, which clearly can have nothing to do with Brexit.'\n\nThe PM's spokesman played down the prospect of Airbus carrying out its plans today, saying she had already 'listened to concerns' from business and plans were making 'good progress'.\n\n'We are confident we are going to get a good deal, one that ensures trade is as free and frictionless as possible,' the spokesman said.\n\n'We have made good progress - part of that work is listening to business.\n\n'What commercial companies choose to do in the public domain is down to them.'\n\nThe blunt statement from Airbus is one of the most significant interventions by a major company since the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nIt would make the firm the first big manufacturer to pull investment from the UK over fears about the stalled Brexit negotiations.\n\nPublishing a Brexit 'risk assessment' on its website, the firm also called on the Government to extend the planned transition period due to run until December 2020 if a deal is agreed, saying it was too short for the business to reorganise its supply chain.\n\nIf there was no extension it would 'carefully monitor any new investments in the UK and refrain from extending the UK suppliers/partners base', it said.\n\nTory MP Stephen Crabb said the warning from Airbus should be a 'wake-up call'.\n\nThe former Secretary of State for Wales, who represents Preseli Pembrokeshire, tweeted: 'The enormous Airbus factory in North Wales is one of the jewels in the crown of UK manufacturing.

Put simply, a no-deal scenario directly threatens Airbus' future in the UK.'\n\nIn its risk assessment, Airbus says it is 'getting increasingly concerned by the lack of progress on the Brexit process'.\n\nIt says it supports more than 110,000 jobs among 4,000 suppliers in the UK, with parts crossing the Channel 'multiple times'.\n\nThis business relies on 'frictionless trade' under customs union and single market rules, it added, saying 'any change in customs procedures, logistics and environmental standards would have major industrial and cost impact'.\n\nIt went on: 'A no-deal Brexit must be avoided, as it would force Airbus to reconsider its footprint in the country, its investments in the UK and at large its dependency on the UK.\n\nAn Airbus employee at the firm's Filton plant in Bristol works on the tailfin of an A440M in this file photo\n\n'Given the 'No-deal/hard Brexit' uncertainties, the company's dependence on and investment in the flagship Wing Of Tomorrow programme would also have to be revisited, and corresponding key competencies grown outside the UK.\n\n'This extremely negative outcome for Airbus would be catastrophic.\n\n'It would impair our ability to benefit from highly qualified British resources, it would also severely undermine UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, while developing high value jobs and competencies.'\n\nThe news was greeted by anger from Labour MPs.\n\nDarren Jones, whose Bristol North West constituency contains Airbus's Filton wing plant, attacked the Government for only listening to 'hardline pro-Brexit MPs and not to the businesses that employ thousands of British workers, including Airbus'.\n\nThe People's Vote supporter added: 'Thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs are now on the line because of the shambolic mess the Government have created over the Brexit negotiations.'\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hit out on Twitter, saying: 'If proof was needed that the PM's Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it.'\n\nAnd former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie wrote: 'And we're all supposed to go along with this Government's disastrous #Brexit strategy?! Constituents in manufacturing & service sectors who jobs are at risk will be unforgiving of any more MP fence-sitting 'constructive ambiguity'.'\n\nBen Bradshaw described it as 'devastating news', adding: 'When are we going to wake up to the disaster of this Tory #BrexitShambles??', while Chuka Umunna questioned: 'What will it take for the establishments running Westminster to wake up!'", "PARIS/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, whose Chinese parent Geely is considering an IPO of the Swedish carmaker, said it was on track for another sales record despite rising trade tensions, after second-quarter profit rose on strong demand for its SUVs.\n\nOperating profit increased 29 percent to 4.2 billion Swedish crowns ($474 million) in the three months to June 30, on 66 billion crowns in revenue, up by more than a quarter. The carmaker previously reported a 14.4 percent increase in deliveries to 317,639 vehicles for the first half.\n\nAcquired by Geely in 2010, the maker of sleek-but-sober premium cars such as the XC90 SUV and S60 sedan has notched up four straight record sales years, raising its game against larger rivals Mercedes and BMW.\n\nGeely has hired Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to prepare Volvo for a stock-market flotation this year, Reuters reported in May.\n\nPledging on Thursday to hit a fifth record in 2018, Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said the first-half performance left Volvo \"well positioned for a new period of sustainable global growth\". The company recently opened its first U.S. plant in Charleston, South Carolina, now ramping up S60 production.\n\nWhile the $1.1 billion investment offers some protection against mounting trade tariffs, however, the company remains dependent on imports of the flagship XC90 in its fastest-growing market. Volvo's U.S. sales rose 40 percent in the first half.\n\nSedans such as the S60 fell to below one-third of U.S. registrations in the second quarter from 38 percent a year earlier - while pickups and SUVs like the Chinese-built XC90 jumped from 62 to 67.3 percent, according to Autodata figures.\n\nWashington this month slapped 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports including cars, and Beijing quickly retaliated with an increase in tariffs on U.S. goods. President Donald Trump is also threatening tariffs against car imports from Europe, where Volvo has two car plants.\n\nVolvo has so far made no changes to its announced plans to focus on sedan production in Charleston, while importing its flagship SUV to the United States.\n\nBut Geely - which hopes any IPO will command a high valuation for Volvo's big plans in autonomous, electrified and subscription-based motoring - has acknowledged the problem.\n\nSpeaking in Hong Kong last month, Geely Chairman Li Shufu said higher tariffs would bring price increases and force Volvo to diversify its U.S., Chinese and European production to assemble more models in each region.\n\n\"We will have to invest in producing a higher number of car models locally,\" the South China Morning Post quoted him as saying.\n\nVolvo's first-half profit rose 15.7 percent to 7.8 billion crowns on revenue of 122.9 billion crowns, up 23.6 percent.\n\n($1 = 8.8648 Swedish crowns)\n\n(Reporting by Laurence Frost in Paris and Esha Vaish in Stockholm; Additional reporting by Nick Carey in Detroit; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nBy Laurence Frost and Esha Vaish", "New Delhi: The lawyer of the thirty-nine-year-old female flight attendant, who allegedly committed suicide in south Delhi's Panchsheel Park, said the victim was locked inside a room and wanted to call police.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, Anissia Batra's lawyer said \"minutes before she allegedly committed suicide, the victim had messaged her friends to call the police.

It is suspected that\n\nthey must have had arguments over it,\" said the officer.\n\nHer family alleged that Singhvi used to physically abuse her and they also accused his parents of harassing her for dowry.\n\nSinghvi was arrested on Monday and was produced in a city court on Tuesday that sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.\n\n\"We will apply for his custody after recording the statements of witnesses,\" the official added.\n\nA family friend of the victim said the police informed them about Singhvi's court hearing half an hour before her cremation.\n\n\"The cremation was planned for 12 pm today. The police were aware about it. We were told that the hearing would take place at 2 pm but at 11:30 am we were informed that the hearing was re-scheduled for 12 pm. This is unacceptable and inhuman on the part of police,\" said the friend who did not wish to be named.\n\nShe claimed that Batra's brother did not even get a chance to say goodbye to her.\n\nThe police said that it was the duty of the investigating officer to inform the complainant's family about the hearing.\n\nHer family also accused the police of not arresting Singhvi's parents, despite them also being \"responsible\" for her death.\n\n\"Singhvi's family have used influence. We need media support. His parents should also be arrested because they have constantly instigated fights between them,\" she alleged.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (South) Romil Baaniya said Singhvi's parents had been granted exemption from joining the probe by the court till July 20 on personal grounds.\n\nThey would be questioned after that, he said.\n\nThe officer said the victim's parents told the magistrate that Batra was harassed for dowry and they would be speaking to her parents.\n\nBaaniya also said they would try to ascertain the reason for the argument between the couple, following which Batra had allegedly jumped from the terrace.\n\nThe victim had sent a message to her husband that \"he would see her dead face\" before taking the extreme step, police said.\n\nBatra's family alleged that her husband used to \"physically assault\" her and also ask for money. Another issue the couple had a fight about was Batra selling off her flat in Vasant Vihar, he said.\n\nThe officer said Singhvi, a software engineer in Gurgaon, used to earn Rs four crore per year and gifted luxurious items to Batra. He had even gifted her a BWW on her birthday. The BMW was seized by the police.\n\nBatra's family claimed that Singhvi had started \"physically abusing\" her right from their honeymoon and in June this year, he had even assaulted her mother.\n\n(with PTI inputs)", "The son of former Real Housewives of Orange County star Lauri Peterson, currently in jail awaiting his second trial on an attempted murder charge, is set to go on hunger strike, DailyMail.com can reveal.\n\nJosh Waring is planning the extreme protest on Wednesday over what he sees as a series of 'breaches' of his constitutional rights by the authorities in Orange County, California.\n\nWaring, who has spent the past two years in Orange County Jail, is due to go back on trial this September, but maintains he's being framed for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nThe 29-year-old former drug addict was arrested in June 2016 for allegedly shooting Daniel Lopez in Costa Mesa, California and then fleeing in a stolen vehicle.\n\nWaring's first trial was ruled a mistrial because his right to a speedy trial was violated.\n\nHe is protesting in conjunction with an American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California protest planned for 10am on Thursday outside the jail.\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com in an exclusive jailhouse interview he said: 'We're doing a hunger strike, me and a friend in here called Jonathan Martinez.\n\nLauri Peterson's son Josh Waring (right) says he is going on a hunger strike to protest his series of 'breaches' of his constitutional rights by the authorities in Orange County, California\n\n'We're just gonna peacefully protest a lot of these constitutional violations here.\n\n'We're sick of it. By no means do we think that the Sheriff's Department (will change), they probably want us to go ahead and starve ourselves, but we're not doing it for them, we're trying to get the public to see that we're willing to sacrifice for change.\n\n'We're hoping to bolster our arguments and show what they're doing.'\n\nOne of Waring's main gripes is that law enforcement inappropriately monitored and recorded his phone calls in jail while he was representing himself in the case.\n\nDuring the hundreds of calls made in the months after his arrest Waring discussed his defense strategy with family and friends.\n\nThe information gleaned from the confidential calls was provided to prosecutors - violating Waring's right to a fair trial.\n\nWaring, 29, a former drug addict has spent the past two years in jail, is due to go back on trial this September, for attempted murder\n\nWaring said: 'I had a court order stating I should have unmonitored phone calls, but they listened in any way.\n\n'Not only did they listen, they gave the recordings to Costa Mesa Police Department.\n\n'While I'm representing myself talking with my family about defense strategy, talking about what witnesses I want to use, my entire game plan, they have everything I'm doing at trial, they're already completely fully aware of my entire strategy.'\n\nWaring was arrested after witnesses told police that he had left the house where the shooting happened after a confrontation with a resident but returned around 2.30am in a white BMW X3 that belonged to his girlfriend.\n\nShots were fired at three people outside, authorities said.\n\nBut Waring claims the victim has told police the shots '100%' came from a blue car owned by a drug dealer who was also there that night, and not from the white BMW he was driving.\n\nWaring says he has never owned nor used a gun and points to a police cover-up.\n\nHe claims the drug dealer and convicted felon, who is a long time police informant and gun owner, is being protected.\n\nIn an article on ocweekly.com titled 'Cop-Protected Orange County Snitch Avoids Murder Beefs With Laughable Tales', author R Scott Moxley alleges that the dealer was at the crime scene with Waring but 'managed to quickly win police exoneration'.\n\nWaring (pictured with his girlfriend) was arrested in June 2016 for allegedly shooting Daniel Lopez in Costa Mesa, California and then fleeing in a stolen vehicle\n\nLauri, pictured with her son and daughter has maintained that her son is innocent and has been framed\n\n'He understands this case and although there were a couple of minor mistakes, he is the closest to the truth that I've seen so far,' Waring's mom Peterson tweeted about Moxley's story. 'Much more to come'.\n\nWaring himself said: '[The drug dealer] has had a long long history of being an informant, so right off the top they're trying to protect him.'\n\nWaring's lawyer previously alleged that the dealer was given 'special treatment' by officers and that he was a police informant in a 2004 case.\n\nThe attorney, who has filed a motion to dismiss based on outrageous government misconduct, also said in court that police never tested the dealer's hands or clothing for gunshot residue and didn't search the vehicle until two days later.\n\nDailyMail.com is unable to verify the claims of corruption and misconduct by authorities in Orange County.\n\nSix months after the shooting, Waring inquired about the results of the dealer's gunshot residue report only to be told he was never tested.\n\nWaring said: 'They tested me, they tested my hands, my face, my hair, my arms. They took my shirt. They swabbed my entire body for gunshot residue and found nothing.\n\n'Why wouldn't they test [him] as well, it doesn't make any sense, it's a cover-up.'\n\nWaring said his mother Lauri and girlfriend Shelby have been a huge support during his time behind bars.\n\n'They've been awesome, great. They're probably the thing that keeps me going. My family, Shelby's great. My daughter, they're kind of acting inadvertently as my defense team.'\n\nWaring appeared on RHOC with his mom until she quit in 2009 for privacy reasons over her son's legal woes. Above she is pictured with co-star Vicki Gunvalson\n\nLauri divorced Josh's father and is now married to George Peterson (pictured in 2016)\n\nWaring says his mom has been to every single court appearance and he speaks to her and Shelby on the phone almost daily.\n\nSurprisingly, Waring insists being thrown into jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit does have a silver-lining.\n\n'Hindsight's 20/20, but I don't regret anything,' he explains.\n\n'I know it sounds crazy, but I'm thankful for the system. 'I'm thankful for the corruption locally because if it wasn't for a lot of this stuff, I'd probably be doing the same thing right now.\n\n'I'm not out there getting loaded, throwing my life away.\n\n'It took this to change my life, that's the silver lining.'\n\nWaring, who was hooked on heroin, said that when he first arrived in jail he took drugs and drank illegal prison hooch to get by.\n\nBut he has now been sober for ten months and is focused on his release and making a fresh start.\n\nMom Lauri agrees that there has been some positives to the family nightmare.\n\n'I've always said that that is the silver lining, I really feel that he was on a path... I was waiting to get the call that he had overdosed,' she explained.\n\nWaring is awaiting trial at intake release center at Orange County Jail (pictured)\n\n'But on this last occasion when I get the call about his arrest, it just didn't make sense for me because it just isn't Josh, that's not who he is, he's never been a violent person, never has hurt anybody else.'\n\nThe legal process and alleged corruption has been hugely eye-opening for Lauri.\n\n'There's a lot of hearings and the more hearings we go through, the more we find out how Josh's rights have been violated and it's very disturbing for me to see what is actually happening in Orange County. It's shocking,' she explains.\n\n'I mean, you hear these things, you see it in movies and you think, okay, this doesn't really happen, but it is happening and it's systematic and it's a lot deeper, I think, than what anybody knows.'\n\nPeterson, a cast member on RHOC from 2006 to 2008, said she is 'worried' about her son's hunger strike plan, but fears that the system will continue to let her son down despite his protest.\n\n'I think there's a lot of fear in Orange County to do the right thing for a lot of different people, whether it's judges, sheriffs, attorneys, whatever,' she said.\n\n'I would be surprised if the judge does the right thing.'\n\nShe added: 'But bottom line, you're never going to find a jury to find Josh guilty of this attempted murder because he didn't do it. And it's there. If you look at all of the evidence, there is no evidence against him.'\n\nWaring appeared on RHOC with his mom until she quit in 2009 for privacy reasons over her son's legal woes.\n\nLauri, who is divorced from Waring's father, was one of the original RHOC stars, but has only done guest shots in recent years.\n\nWaring is facing three counts of attempted murder and other felony and misdemeanor charges and could face multiple life prison sentences if convicted.\n\nWaring is due back in court on July 26 when a judge will decide whether his case will be dismissed or go to trial in September.\n\nHe added: 'If I do get out, assuming I do get out, then I will in some capacity try to involve myself in criminal litigation or justice reform. I really feel that way. It's just something that I'm just gonna never forget.'", "Goodwood Estate, United Kingdom -- Flashy Mustangs grinding up a hill. Race car drivers signing autographs. Food tents serving up bacon sandwiches.\n\nThis is the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a four-day celebration of British motoring that could serve as a possible inspiration for transforming the North American International Auto Show.\n\nAs traditional auto shows from Detroit to Paris struggle to stay relevant, auto show organizers are looking to this annual event in West Sussex for ideas on creating their own citywide celebration of the automobile.\n\nThe Detroit Auto Dealers Association, organizer of the annual show at Cobo Center, dispatched floor manager Andrea Trudeau to Goodwood last weekend to scout out the festival.\n\n\"It's a celebration of cars as opposed to a display of cars,\" said Steven Armstrong, head of European operations for Ford Motor Co., which had a major presence at Goodwood this year. \"A lot of people come here to see the latest GT go up the hill, but while they're here (we get to) engage the next generation of buyers.\n\nMarking its 25th anniversary this year, the Goodwood Festival was set up like a music festival for cars: For four days, automakers brought out their fastest, loudest and most expensive vehicles to race up a hill on a mile-long track that bisected the festival grounds. Others fought for position around a rally track.\n\nSpread throughout the estate were food stands, vendor tents where companies showcased new technology, and towering stands erected by global automakers where attendees kicked the tires of new cars and took them on test drives.\n\nEngines roared. Cars churned dust from the lawn as they clipped corners approaching the hill-climb. Professional drivers did burn-outs or ripped doughnuts in front of the estate before rocketing up the hill.\n\nWith experiences like that, Goodwood attendance has grown steadily to more than 200,000, with millions more watching online. The expansion has come even as Detroit and other mainline shows lose manufacturers who no longer consider them \"must-attend\" events -- and as car buyers look to the Internet to research vehicles.\n\nThe downward trend for traditional auto shows is so unmistakable that Detroit planners have decided to move their 2020 event from January to June. It's part of an effort to reinvent the Detroit auto show after several global automakers -- including Germany's \"Big Three\" of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- decided to join the exodus from the January 2019 show. Their defections follow other carmakers who have skipped the past couple of shows.\n\nHeld every summer since 1993, the Festival of Speed on the grounds of the sprawling Goodwood Estate two hours south of London combines racing with a car show that brings together historic vehicles, concept cars, motorcycles and supercars that most drivers could only dream of owning. Automakers erect outdoor two- and three-story displays around the grounds.\n\nIt's a loud, fast event that attracts enthusiasts from around the world to eat, drink and cheer as famous drivers pilot cars up the hill and around the track.\n\n\"Goodwood has become the U.K. auto show,\" Stuart Dyble, a long-time auto industry public relations executive and CEO of London-based Influence Associates, said in an interview here with The Detroit News. Dyble headed Ford Motor Co.'s European product launches and auto shows in the late 1990s before becoming vice president of public relations for the Blue Oval's now-defunct Premier Automotive Group.\n\n\"There is absolutely no doubt that all the major auto shows are struggling,\" said Dyble, whose firm assisted nine brands at Goodwood this year, including Jaguar Land Rover, which built its Goodwood stand around a three-story tree. \"They're all in the process of reinventing themselves. Automotive enthusiasts and consumers can get every bit of information they want about a new car online.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Festival of Speed, originally inspired by the Indianapolis 500, is becoming a force in the global auto scene. It's become more important in the U.K. since the British International Motor Show died in 2008.\n\nFord, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, McLaren, Jaguar Land Rover and others last weekend used the event to showcase top-of-the-line cars most people could only dream of driving.\n\nThis year, Ford raced the eye-catching GT supercar, performed stunts with an F-150 and Ranger Raptors, and launched the 2019 special-edition 475-horsepower Mustang Bullitt on the hill-climb alongside the original Mustang fastback that Steve McQueen famously drove in a car-chase through San Francisco in the groundbreaking 1968 movie. At the 2018 Detroit auto show, those vehicles were largely stationary.\n\nLooking for inspiration\n\nThe Festival of Speed would be impossible to copy, say North American International Auto Show organizers and those running events for major automakers. But they say there's a template for auto show success here that could be adapted for a reimagined Detroit show.\n\nDetroit Auto Dealers Association spokesman Max Muncey told The Detroit News that while this was the first year his crew sent a representative to Goodwood, he and his team have kept tabs on the event through livestreams, media coverage and by talking with carmakers who've attended.\n\n\"The festival-like atmosphere (at Goodwood) with dynamic vehicle debuts are something that would play well for us in warmer months,\" Muncey said. \"What we look to deliver in 2020 and beyond will be unique to Detroit and showcase not only our great city, but the global automotive leadership this region holds.\"\n\nDetails on changes could come Tuesday when the Detroit show officially announces the date change from winter to summer.\n\nEd Laukes, group vice president for Toyota Motor North America, believes changes are needed. \"It would behoove all shows, including NAIAS, to look at all the new elements they feel are successful in attracting attendees and coverage. Festivals like (Goodwood) are a great example of success... some experiential elements would add value and shimmer to auto shows.\"\n\nAt its core, the Goodwood Festival of Speed is a celebration of cars, motorcycles and racing that offers consumers an \"experience,\" Ed Foster, deputy head of Goodwood's motorsport content, told The News in an interview. The Formula One speedsters, drift cars, luxury sport cars, supercars and muscle cars -- some piloted by famous race drivers -- launch from the starting line of the hill-climb track nearly every 30 seconds. All day long.\n\nAdd to that a historic estate hosting the festival, food stands pushing British fare like bacon-and-butter sandwiches, and appearances by some of the most storied vehicles in European racing history.\n\nGoodwood embraces its British identity, and that's part of what's clicking with attendees.\n\n\"You don't get any show that has absolutely everything,\" said Jack Burgoine, a 22-year-old who traveled to the show from Bedfordshire with his brother and father. \"It's definitely better when the car comes to life. There's more to do than just look at cars.\"\n\nEvery vehicle that races at Goodwood is parked in a paddock between runs for fans to come take a look. Drivers hang around for autographs. When cars fire up for a run, crowds flock to the sound.\n\nJulio Checchi, 14, and his father traveled from Argentina with their family for this year's festival. On the second floor of Ford's stand, father and son grinned as they rounded the corner to encounter the Bullitt Mustang.\n\nThe boy had just seen his favorite Lotus supercar race up the track. That alone meant Goodwood overshadowed any South American auto show he's attended.\n\n\"You get to see the cars in action,\" he said. \"I've seen the car before, but it was just sitting there. Here, I saw that just 10 minutes ago fly by on the track. It's amazing.\"\n\nDisplays stands often included live music or performances.\n\nFord had a ledge for visitors to jump about one-and-a-half stories onto a cushioned pad. Every hour, Ford had an acrobatics team put on a brief show using that same feature.\n\nLand Rover allowed people to drive SUVs on an off-road course. There's was a half-hour waiting line the entire weekend.\n\nChanging business model\n\nThat kind of active consumer traffic is resonating with automakers.\n\nThe presence of several brands, including Jaguar, Land Rover, Ford, BMW and Porsche has grown significantly in recent years. Automakers declined to comment on how much they spend at Goodwood compared to other auto shows.\n\nBut some companies that are pulling out of Detroit for 2019 -- namely Mercedes and BMW -- footed the bill to build multiple stands at Goodwood. Even Tesla, the Silicon Valley automaker that says auto shows are not part of its marketing plan, operated a stand here featuring all three of its cars, including the new Model 3.\n\nFord, meantime, juggles both old and new. Armstrong, Ford's head of European operations, said the company looks at Goodwood as a chance to show off performance vehicles in a more dynamic way.\n\n\"All of us are having to look at our business models\" for auto shows, Armstrong said. Auto shows and automakers, he said, need to figure out how to \"move with the times.\"\n\nCars take center stage\n\nGoodwood's growth in recent years is a product of authenticity, said Dyble, the London-based public relations executive. Organizers play to the history of British motorsports and British brands by bringing out storied vehicles for the hill climb. But they also nod to the future.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles raced up the hill throughout the weekend. Vendors set up stands on the sprawling lawn to showcase drones, autonomous technology and mobility-related ventures that have become front-and-center at the Detroit show. A man in a jet pack flew up and down a stretch of track each day.\n\nBut those were ancillary features. The main focus of the Festival of Speed seldom wavers from the cars -- and the history. Detroit, the birthplace of the modern automobile and the moving assembly line, could do something similar by drawing on its own unique history, Dyble believes.\n\n\"Detroit gives you a tremendous backdrop on which to draw,\" he said. \"People will buy into that. There's a real chance here, isn't there? Detroit needs to get back to leading again. This is where the auto show leads again.\"", "The automotive industry is undergoing seismic change, fuelled by multi-billion-pound investments in electric, autonomous, and robotic technology from manufacturers and governments alike.\n\nBut while the commercial attractiveness of being first to cross the finish line in the race for driverless remains, it is important to recognise the challenges that come with some of the technologies that sit at the heart of making driverless a reality.\n\nMechanical glitches that may once have been restricted to brake pads or suspension levels have transitioned to self-parking sensors, connectivity, rear-view cameras, and electronic handbrakes, to name a few.\n\nRead more: Consumer fears about driverless cars are steadily dropping\n\nThe introduction of these features has been designed to make driving an easier, safer, and more enjoyable experience, but recent testing has revealed a vulnerability to hacking, with the potential to put the lives of drivers at risk.\n\nTake software coding risks, for example. These were recently highlighted when a Chinese cyber security lab identified 14 separate flaws in BMW's car computer systems.\n\nMoreover, research from Tencent's Keen Security Lab exposed a range of ways that hackers could compromise the safety of cars, including using infected USB sticks to connect to Bluetooth, thus exploiting the vehicles' 3G/4G data links.\n\nWhile 14 faults may sound problematic, it could be the tip of the iceberg of an issue that is much greater. A further unrelated study found that it takes around 200 days for data breaches to be detected, which means that there may be additional undetected vulnerabilities present in BMWs and in other connected cars, and that BMW could find itself the face of a far wider problem.\n\nDespite these safety concerns, innovation in automotive technology sees no sign of abating. The question is therefore how the insurance sector will need to evolve to respond accordingly.\n\nAt what point should risk be transferred from the driver to the manufacturer? In the event of an incident, does blame lie with the technology company behind a particular software? The chain of establishing liability becomes much longer and more complex.\n\nUntil we have more clarity on driverless vehicles, we shouldn't assume that dangers won't exist. This was most recently demonstrated by the fatality involving the self-driving Uber in Arizona earlier this year.\n\nIt was therefore surprising to see Carlos Ghosn, chairman of the Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi alliance, last month claim that \"all the reasons you have today for a car accident you are going to make disappear\" with the introduction of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis statement focuses on the potential upsides of reducing the risk of human error, which of course exist. However, it ignores the fact that the risk profiles of such vehicles are markedly different, thus opening the possibility of new accident triggers.\n\nDriverless cars will undoubtedly reduce the likelihood of human error, but at such an early stage of development we can't yet rule out risks associated with the technology itself.\n\nFurthermore, driverless vehicles will drive on the same road infrastructure as current vehicles - and that infrastructure is full of potholes, inconsistent or degraded signage, and of course other vehicles. A fleet of driverless vehicles will not absolve the government of the need to provide safe and well maintained roads.\n\nInvestment in automotive innovation should continue to be encouraged, but not at the detriment of safety. Ensuring we balance what is technologically possible with what is socially acceptable means understanding the full extent of the risks associated with driverless technology before customers are handed the keys.\n\nThere remains a vast range of differing views on how quickly fully autonomous cars will become mainstream on public roads in the UK; particularly prevalent given the emphasis of autonomous cars within the government's industrial strategy.\n\nBut a disproportionate focus on the future should not take precedence over the importance of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of customers.\n\nRegulating a complex new technology, and technologies that go hand-in-hand with that, is difficult, particularly when it is evolving rapidly.\n\nDeep and detailed guidance on the considerations and legalities of autonomous vehicles for the vast number of organisations involved in the driverless revolution is vital, as well as ensuring that autonomous vehicles are safe, without inhibiting innovation.\n\nRead more: Majority would use autonomous cars but worry about etiquette in car shares", "NEW DELHI: BMW on Wednesday rolled out locally-made motorcycles in India -- with an entry price of Rs 3 lakh -- as the German brand looks to tap into the growing love of Indians for luxury and leisure biking. After making a 310cc bike, BMW is also exploring the sub-300cc space as it wants to develop new models for India, that can be also be sold across the world markets.\n\nBMW Motorrad, the motorcycling arm of the company, has partnered Venu Srinivasan's TVS Motors for manufacturing of two models -- G310R and G310 GS -- at its Hosur plant.\n\nTVS sells its own version of motorcycles under the Apache range, which are priced much lower. BMW has started sale of 310cc bikes through a handful of Motorrad dealerships. \"We begin with seven retailers, and this should go up to 10 by next year,\" Dimitris Raptis, Motorrad's head of region (Asia, China, Pacific and South Africa), said. The company has been selling over a dozen more-powerful models in India, which are expensive (upwards of Rs 12 lakh) and come via imports. The imported line-up consists of 15 models and prices here can go up to Rs 85 lakh for the 999cc HP4 Race model.\n\nBMW has already started exports of the 310cc model. \"We have had a good run with 310cc model over the past one year, and have clocked sales of around 20,000 units across markets in Europe, North America, Russia, China, Japan and South Africa,\" Raptis said. \"There has been an extremely positive acceptance and we are very pleased with the commitment and manufacturing quality of our partner TVS.\" A number of luxury makers, including Harley-Davidson in bikes and Jeep in SUVs, have been looking at local manufacturing of lower-cc models to drive in affordability and appeal among Indian buyers.", "By James Tapsfield, Political Editor and Iain Burns For Mailonline\n\nPutin said Russia has 'destroyed all chemical weapons' as he gave a victory speech in Red Square during which he also pledged to work with British police over Salisbury\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin has said claims his country was behind the Salisbury poisoning are 'drivel, rubbish, nonsense' as he won a landslide victory in yesterday's election.\n\nHe also contradicted Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's claims earlier today that Russia has been stockpiling Novichok - the nerve agent used in the attack.\n\nPutin said Russia has 'destroyed all chemical weapons' as he gave a victory speech in Red Square, during which he also pledged to work with British police over Salisbury.\n\nJohnson yesterday claimed Russia has kept producing Novichok as the row over the Salisbury attack escalated.\n\nHe added: 'With regards to this tragedy, the first thing that came to my mind: If this was a military substance, they would have died straight away.

'We have friends across the world and he does not,' he said.\n\nMr Johnson also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn over his unwillingness to condemn Russia over the outrage, saying: 'He let down his party and country by seemingly aiding the efforts of the Russian propaganda machine by casting doubt over what is obvious to any objective onlooker.'\n\nWhat is the Novichok nerve agent used against the Skripals?\n\nThe Novichok nerve agent used against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia is among the most deadly poisons ever created.\n\nThey were secretly developed by the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold war in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nCommunist scientists developed the poison so it would not be able to be detected by Nato's chemical detection equipment.\n\nThey come in the form of a ultra-fine powder, Novichok is up to eight times more potent than the deadly VX gas.\n\nVictims who are poisoned by the powder suffer muscle spasms, breathing problems and then cardiac arrest.\n\nThere is a known antidote to the nerve agent - atropine can block the poison.\n\nBut doctors find it very tricky to administer the antidote because the dose would have to be so high it could prove fatal for the person.\n\nNovichok poisons are highly dangerous to handle, requiring the expertise of skilled scientists in a sophisticated lab.\n\nDr Vil Mirzayanov, former Chief of the Foreign Technical Counterintelligence Department at Russia's premiere, was among the team of scientists who helped develop the agent.\n\nIn an article about the lethal weapon, he wrote: 'They are extremely dangerous - most likely lethal - for people who would try to synthesise or manipulate them without the help of highly experienced scientists and engineers in special laboratory installations observing extreme safety measures.\n\n'Without exception, Novichok weapons cannot be used for any reason without specially trained military personnel under medical supervision.'\n\nTheresa May has said Britain and its allies are considering their next move and the national security council will meet again this week.\n\nFormer double agent Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter remain in a critical condition in hospital, while Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was exposed to the Novichok nerve agent while responding to the incident, is no longer considered critical.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday that it had ordered the British diplomats to leave within a week and indicated it could take further action should there be what it called more 'unfriendly' moves.\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday, Mr Johnson said: 'These futile measures will only punish ordinary Russians by depriving them of harmless opportunities to learn English and apply for UK visas.\n\n'Today Russia stands alone and isolated.\n\n'That fact demonstrates the most telling difference between Britain and Putin: we have friends across the world and he does not.'\n\nMr Johnson added: 'We knew there would be risks in opposing the Kremlin - resisting a bully is always risky.\n\n'But we did it anyway because we knew it to be right.'\n\nSpeaking at the Conservative Spring Forum yesterday, Mrs May said the Government had 'anticipated' a response to her decision to expel 23 Russian 'spies' from London.\n\nShe said: 'Russia's response doesn't change the facts of the matter - the attempted assassination of two people on British soil for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable.\n\n'It is Russia that is in flagrant breach of international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention.'\n\nMrs May also received support from Labour former PM Tony Blair and her old foe George Osborne.\n\nAsked at the Global Education and Skills Forum (GESF) in Dubai about the British response to the Salisbury nerve agent attack, former prime minister Tony Blair said: 'I think the Government has done the right thing in relation to it.\n\n'It can't allow such a thing to happen and not take action.\n\n'But I think there's a bigger question underlying that, because over the years there's been periodic action taken.\n\n'What this shows is the importance of the alliance and the importance of having the allies in conversation with each other where they are able to work out the strategy for keeping the West strong, because you are defending certain values.'\n\nBodies of exiles who died suddenly could be exhumed\n\nOne is Alexander Perepilichny, 43, who collapsed while out jogging at his home in the St George's Hill area of Weybridge, Surrey, in 2012\n\nThe bodies of two Russian exiles who died suddenly in Britain could be exhumed and tested for nerve agent poisoning, it emerged last night.\n\nOne is Alexander Perepilichny, 43, who collapsed while out jogging at his home in the St George's Hill area of Weybridge, Surrey, in 2012. He had provided evidence of fraud perpetrated by Kremlin-linked officials.\n\nThe other is Badri Patarkatsishvili, who died suddenly at his mansion in Leatherhead, Surrey in 2008 - seven years after fleeing his homeland.\n\nThe 52-year-old was a business partner of Boris Berezovsky, an enemy of Vladimir Putin who was also found dead in his Surrey home in 2013.\n\nAnother business partner, 68-year-old Nikolai Glushkov, was murdered a week ago at his home in south London.\n\nPolice said he was strangled. Friends of both Perepilichny and Patarkatsishvili have called for their remains to be exhumed for further testing, according to the Daily Telegraph. One source, who wished to remain anonymous over fears of retaliation, said: 'The Home Office must consider exhuming Badri's body.\n\n'They never did the toxicological report. Surrey Police just said he had a bad heart and had a heart attack. But I had seen him before his death and he was absolutely fine.'\n\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd has called for a fresh probe to be conducted by MI5 and police into 14 unexplained deaths, including Perepilichny, Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky.\n\nYvette Cooper, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said: 'It is clear that further criminal investigations are needed into the activities of the Russian state on our soil.'\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said it could not comment while the Salisbury investigation was still underway. The Home Office declined to give more details 'at this stage'.\n\nAppearing on stage at the Global Education and Skills Forum with Mr Blair, Mr Osborne said Russian interference on British soil was 'staggering'.\n\n'No state can tolerate that. No alliance of western states can accept that,' he said.\n\n'People in Britain will know I'm not a completely enthusiastic support of Mrs May, but I think she has done a pretty good job.\n\n'She has ratcheted up the response, she has expelled Russian diplomats and she has got to think... how do I react to the Russian reaction?\n\n'So she has got to keep further options in her locker to make sure that you can increase the pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, counter-terrorism police renewed their appeal for sightings of Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car, registration HD09 WAO, in Salisbury on the morning of Sunday, March 4.\n\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: 'We are learning more about Sergei and Yulia's movements but we need to be clearer around their exact movements on the morning of the incident.'\n\nDetectives have still not said how Sergei and his daughter were poisoned - and may not even know - as they follow the poison trail (pictured)\n\nJohnson warns against blaming all Russians for Putin's actions as he defends donations to Tories\n\nBoris Johnson today warned against blaming all Russians in the UK for the actions of Vladimir Putin's regime.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary insisted the government is determined to crack down on any dirty money that Oligrachs have pumped into London.\n\nBut he defended the Tories decision to take donations from Russians who have moved to Britain and been given citizenship.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Johnson confirmed he played a tennis game with a Russian donor to the Conservative Party whose husband reportedly has close links to the Kremlin.\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured arriving for his interview in London today) has lashed out at the Kremlin over its 'futile' tit-for-tat in the poison attack row\n\nAsked whether the tennis match with with Vladimir Chernukhin's wife, who had paid \u00a3160,000 to the Tories for the pleasure, actually took place, he replied: 'It did.'\n\nBut Mr Johnson insisted that the Russian people should not be demonised.\n\n'If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentleman you mentioned obtained his wealth, then it is well within, it is possible, for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth,' he said.\n\n'That is a matter for the authorities, it is not a matter for me.'\n\nMr Johnson added: 'Unless and until evidence is produced against individual Russians, I do not think that the entire nation should be, there are many Russian who have come to this country and made their lives here and contributed magnificently to our culture and our society.'", "The Rimac Concept Two: boasting 1,914 horsepower to propel the 0-60 mph in 1.85 seconds, it has a maximum speed to 412 kilometres per hour.\n\nWhile Tesla is stealing much of the innovative limelight in the motoring world, one company that is busy trying to win over petrolheads to the electric car revolution is Rimac Automobili, a little-known Croatian electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer in which Porsche has just taken a minority stake.\n\nEstablished by Mate Rimac, the company has developed the one of world's fastest electric supercars with its latest vehicle, the Rimac Concept Two, boasting 1,914 horsepower to propel the 0-100 km/h in 1.85 seconds, and a maximum speed to 412 km/h.\n\nAlmost every component used in the company's supercars are designed and built from scratch in-house, which partly explains the $2 million starter price for the car.\n\nThe vehicle, which can be unlocked and started using facial recognition technology, comes with Level 4 autonomous capabilities and claims an impressive 400-mile range on a single charge via a 120 kWh battery. It is expected to go into production in 2020 with Rimac looking to manufacture at least 150 of them a year.\n\nWhile the supercars themselves have become objects of desire and helped to change the way people think about EVs, Rimac's other role as a high-end component and technology provider for other companies, including large OEMs, means its parts are turning up elsewhere.\n\nRemember the Jaguar E-Type Zero that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle drove off in after their recent wedding reception? The \u00a3350,000 car, which was originally manufactured in 1968, was converted from a combustion engine into an environmentally friendly electric one by Rimac.\n\nIf you haven't heard of the company from that then maybe they popped up on your radar when footage emerged of presenter Richard Hammond walking away from the burning wreckage of a Rimac Concept One car while shooting the television show The Grand Tour last year. While the jury is still out on whether it was the car or Hammond's driving that led to the crash, the accident certainly didn't hurt Rimac. It recorded an increase in orders as the public heard about the company for the first time.\n\nRimac, which has signed deals to provide components and technology to car manufacturers that include Aston Martin, Jaguar and Koenigsegg, has raised over $30 million to date with Porche the latest investor to come onboard when it took a 10 per cent stake in the company last month. Other major backers include Asia's largest battery manufacturer, Camel Group.\n\nMate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 and remains its majority shareholder, says that while the group has made great progress to date, there is still much for it to achieve.\n\n\"The odds of getting to where we are now were next to nothing and the stars still have to align correctly for us to get where we want to be,\" he told The Irish Times recently.\n\nOne thing the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year award finalist has on his side is time. The Croat, who recently appeared on Forbes prestigious 30 Under 30 list of the top disruptors to watch, turned 30 this month. He said his interest in cars began young.\n\n\"I was always crazy about them. Even before I could walk or talk I was obsessed and that has never left me.\"\n\nAided to a love of cars was an early interest in electronics with the young man winning national awards in the subject while still at school. By the age of 17, Rimac also had a number of patents to his name. But it was two years later when the engine on his 1984 BMW 3 Series blew up that his obsession with cars and electrics merged.\n\nHe fitted the banjaxed BMW with an experimental electric vehicle drivetrain, turning it from a traditional combustion engine to electrical power. He then started racing the car against gas-powered ones.\n\n\"I wanted to prove that electric cars could be exciting rather than just boring and efficient. Of course, people laughed at me initially at the racetrack. There were plenty of wisecracks about having a washing machine on wheels and so on. At the beginning the car wasn't fast or reliable and I'd sometimes get electrocuted while driving it, but over time as we worked on it the car got better,\" said Rimac.\n\nSo much better that the re-engineered vehicle broke five F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) records and earned a Guinness World Record for fastest accelerating vehicle.\n\nIn 2009, Rimac decided to build his own electric car from scratch. What began as a garage project has rapidly grown into a 400-people company based in Sveta Nedelja, near Zagreb. There is also a subsidiary called Greyp Bikes which is developing high-performance electric bicycles that offer 65 km/h top speed and a range of up to 120 km without pedalling.\n\nRimac gained investors early on with the royal family of Abu Dhabi among those who wanted to back the company. However, they pulled out when he wouldn't relocate the company to the Middle East. Ultimately this was a good thing, according to the businessman.\n\n\"It would have been impossible to design cars in the way we have done if we hadn't have had constraints. These constraints helped turn us into a technology company, rather than just a manufacturer,\" he says.\n\n\"If we would have had a lot of finance then we would have just done what everyone else was doing, which is relying on suppliers for parts. But we had to be creative and develop a car from scratch instead. The great thing though about doing this with electric vehicles rather than gas-powered ones is that you can do things you'd never usually be able to do, even it in terms of things like fitting the battery and powertrain differently.\"\n\nHe continues. \" I really don't know of many examples in history where absolutely everything has been developed for one single purpose, which in our case is to design the perfect EV. If you look at other top-of-the-range cars like the LaFerarri for instance. Ferrari has taken the suspension from a 458, while the engine is carried over from an 812, and the gearbox comes from somewhere else again.\n\n\"There was no carryover for us when we designed the Concept car. Absolutely everything, from cooling pumps for batteries, to the chassis, the electrics and suspension were developed specially for it and so is optimised.\"\n\nThe company might not be as well known for its its role as a components manufacturer and technology provider but this part of the business, which grew out of its work designing parts for its own vehicles, helped it become commercially sustainable.\n\n\"Out of necessity we started to work with industry to engineer prototypes for them and this turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to us,\" said Rimac.\n\nAs Tesla has found out, it is one thing to build a prototype and another altogether to ramp up to full production. Rimac says that doing this is the biggest challenge currently facing the company.\n\nAnother big one is trying to build a sustainable business in Croatia. The country may have become known of late for his football team, which got to the World Cup final, but it is hardly the first place you'd think of when it comes to leading car manufacturers,\n\nRimac though is determined that the heart of the business will remain in his home country no matter how big the company grows.\n\n\"We are now employing 400 people and are planning new production facilities in Croatia with the goal of ultimately employing 2,000 people. I have been driven by patriotism for my country and maybe it would be better for the company if this were not so but I want a substantial part of the business to be there,\" he says.\n\n\"The company has a long way to go but I believe we will be known as the ones who make the best electric sports cars in the world and also as the leader provider of technology and parts for premium high performance vehicles made by others,\" Rimac added.", "Slicing an avocado as she prepares dinner with a friend, Jane O'Malley, the protagonist of Alice LaPlante's \"Half Moon Bay,\" observes that \"[n]othing that has been picked ever ripens for [her]. Yet it is perhaps a sign of her madness that she keeps hoping. She buys hard avocados, firm pears, hard peaches. She place them in a bowl on her kitchen table, where they inevitably go from hard to rotten, brown-spotted, smelling of fermented alcohol, festering with fruit flies.\"\n\nMuch of the suspense in this eerie, tense and finely written novel emanates from Jane's too often challenged hope that, at age 39, her own life will ripen -- in particular, that she will survive the death over a year ago of her 16-year-old daughter, Angela, in a traffic accident. Jane's husband has abandoned their faltering marriage. The third in a line of 10 children, she suffered the abuse of an alcoholic father that numbs her still. The steady cadence and muted tone of her observant, but trancelike first-person narrative bespeaks a wounded life.\n\nJane maintains an outward calm as she moves about Princeton-by-the Sea, a village a half-mile north of the titular bay that developers once tried, and failed, to turn into the Atlantic City of the West. The railway station is now a Chinese restaurant that does a \"decent\" Mongolian beef and a sweet and sour pork to avoid.\n\nWork at a nursery steadies Jane, though unresolved anger percolates, often erupting in violent, destructive ways. In a rage, Jane tracks the woman who insists she wasn't texting when her car struck and killed Angela. Now Jane smashes her car into the woman's BMW. A judge sympathetic to the plight of Jane's grief fines her and orders her to pay for damages to the other woman's car.\n\nMore ominous problems arise. Young children in the village -- eventually five of them, all girls -- begin to disappear. In a week or so after they're kidnapped, they're found dead, their faces and hair impeccably, even lovingly, you might say, made up and groomed. Is Jane acting out her grief on these victims? Some in the village suspect so, as does the FBI, called onto the case. They question, then shadow her. Townsfolk, meanwhile lock the windows and doors of their children's bedrooms.\n\nHelp and hope seem to arrive with a handsome stranger named Edward and his partner, Alma. Edward and Jane soon begin a passionate affair. Before long, Alma joins them in a m\u00e9nage a trois. The trysts with the couple bring Jane a comfort she has not felt since losing her daughter. But there are due bills for Jane.\n\nEdward is an environmental activist determined to stop, by violence, if necessary, the building of a resort on the bay. He and Alma manipulate Jane to set fire to equipment on the resort work site. The reader begins to agree with Jane's sense of herself: \"It will take very little to go from unsettled to unhinged.\"\n\nLaPlante fuses two themes in \"Half Moon Bay,\" the mystery of the missing children and the misery of Jane's attempt to survive her losses. The latter strand works far more effectively than the former. Whoever is kidnapping the young girls is pretty much apparent from the start, particularly since the case involves few suspects. And though LaPlante knows how to ramp up suspense (particularly at the end, where it counts), some scenes (Jane's encounters with a hunky surfer co-worker, for example) are pretty obviously red herrings.\n\nJane's story is by far the more meaningful, resonant and humane aspect of \"Half Moon Bay.\" Readers will grip their chairs to see if this wounded soul crashes or pulls up.", "The company says its concept vehicle will sport six electric props and feature wings that rotate 90 degrees to enable vertical takeoff and landing.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have only just begun to navigate our streets and already the world's innovators are setting their sights on the next big transportation trend.\n\nFlying taxis.\n\nUber plans to create a network of flying taxis in Dubai and the Dallas area by the year 2020. Kitty Hawk - a flying car startup created by Google cofounder Larry Page - is already offering test flights to potential customers.\n\nThis week Rolls-Royce entered the fray, unveiling a concept electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain. The vehicle could carry as many as five passengers at speeds up to 250 miles per hour for approximately 500 miles, according to Rolls-Royce.\n\nRolls-Royce said the vehicle could be airborne as soon as the early 2020s, but the company said it plans to create a vehicle prototype within the next 18 months.\n\n\"Building on our existing expertise in electric technologies and aviation, Rolls-Royce is actively exploring a range of possible markets and applications for electric and hybrid electric flight,\" said Rob Watson, who heads Rolls-Royce's Electrical team, in a news release. \"We are well placed to play a leading role in the emerging world of personal air mobility and will also look to work in collaboration with a range of partners.\"\n\nThe British-based company makes commerical jet engines. Referring to Rolls-Royce as \"pioneers,\" Watson added that the company was among the first to develop turbo-prop and jet engines.\n\nRolls-Royce Motor Cars - a company owned by German car manufacturer BMW - is not associated with the effort to create flying taxis.\n\nThe company said its concept vehicle would be powered by six electric propulsors \"specially designed to have a low noise profile.\" To take off or land vertically, the company said, the vehicle's wings would rotate 90 degrees. Once the craft reaches its cruising height, its vehicle's propellers would fold away and the craft would rely on several rear propellers for thrust.\n\nRolls-Royce said the vehicle would fill a niche created by overtaxed transportation systems in increasingly crowded cities. Watson told Agence France-Presse that he envisions an electric version of the vehicle moving passengers around a city but a hybrid propulsion system carrying passengers longer distances, such as between London and Paris. The company noted that the vehicle could be adapted for military purposes as well, though no detail was provided.\n\n\"Electrification is an exciting and inescapable trend across industrial technology markets and while the move to more electric propulsion will be gradual for us, it will ultimately be a revolution,\" Watson said.\n\nDavid Stewart - an aviation and aerospace adviser and partner at Oliver Wyman - told AFP that the aerospace environmental industry is reacting to a push to become less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\n\"I think that electrical propulsion is a potential disruptor to the way things are powered,\" Stewart said. \"We are quite a long way for electrical power to be a replacement for kerosene, but never say never.\"", "Veteran John Daly is back in the winner's circle, 13 years after his last victory\n\nThis is a story about 007: how 007 rescued the reputation of Wentworth and saved it from losing the BMW PGA Championship. How 007 will be lauded by every pro when the European Tour's flagship event takes place in a fortnight's time, turning the locker room from a seething hotbed of disgruntlement into an oasis of tranquility.\n\nNot that 007, obviously. This 007 is a strain of grass also known as 'creeping bent'. It's reasonable to ask: how is grass of the garden variety going to transform the atmosphere at England's most beloved tournament?\n\nLet's rewind to recent editions, where at least half the field were walking round with their faces tripping them. Ian Poulter and Henrik Stenson were so disillusioned by changes to the course and the poor state of the greens they never even made it to the first tee for the last couple. Even Rory McIlroy, who always does more than his share to help European golf, stayed away last year.\n\nThe new and improved West Course at Wentworth is preparing to host the BMW PGA\n\nTo put the tin lid on matters, the Wentworth members were also up in arms at the revised membership proposals put forward by the new Chinese owners. In short, the iconic venue was a mess, and the European Tour was ready to pull the plug.\n\n'We knew we were in grave danger of losing the PGA and we couldn't allow that to happen,' says Wentworth's chief executive Stephen Gibson. 'We knew we had to do something drastic.'\n\nOver the past 12 months an extraordinary \u00a35million has been spent to change the mood. The course reopened last week and it's fair to say the money has been well spent.\n\nTwenty-nine of the bunkers that turned Wentworth from a scenic course in London's stockbrocker belt into something looking like a humdrum venue in Florida have gone.\n\nI had the chance to play it last week and marvelled at the return of a beautiful Surrey walk restored. But that wouldn't be enough to appease the pros. Enter 007.\n\nWentworth admit that they were close to losing the BMW PGA 'and we couldn't allow that'\n\nWentworth course director Kenny Mackay trialled 10 different grasses to fix the controversial greens, where the bent and poa annua strains grew at different times and meant greens that putted well in the morning were a farce by the afternoon.\n\nHe settled on the 007 creeping bent strain, aided by the installation of the first sub-air system in England, more commonly associated with Augusta National.\n\nLet defending PGA champion Chris Wood, who also played the new layout last week, explain the difference. 'It really is night and day,' he said.\n\n'You step on to the first green and your first thought is to wonder if you're on the same golf course. Good putters didn't like it before because the greens turned putting into a lottery. Now they're really going to fancy their chances.'\n\nRory, Henrik and Justin will all be back, and Wood is emboldened enough to make a big prediction. 'After they've played the course and marvelled at the greens, you're going to see a real outpouring of love,' he said. There you have it. 007 saves the day.

Yes, that John Daly, back in the winner's circle 13 years after his last victory on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe 51-year-old revelled in the champagne celebrations in a scene that will make every golf-lover smile.\n\nJohn Daly was back in the winner's circle at the weekend when he won on the Champions Tour", "The 2018 Mazda CX-9 seats seven for family trips to the soccer field. And with up to 250 horsepower and optional AWD, it can hustle through the winter months also.\n\nI'm as weak as the next guy. Set me up with a shapely Audi A7 sedan. Or a cheetah-quick Porsche Boxster GTS. Or an explosively powerful, 707-horse Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. Ooooooh, I would rob a bank to get them in my garage.\n\nBut try to sell me a three-row family luxury SUV and I'm more rational. Five-door utility and fundamental physics have made some mainstream vehicles as desirable as their premium peers.\n\nTake the upwardly mobile $43,445 Mazda CX-9 and $43,145 GMC Acadia sport utilities I've been hanging out in.\n\nThese two mainstream brands have translated their (respectively) sports car and truck DNA into family haulers that are easy on the eyes, tech savvy and fun to drive. In so doing they have largely closed the gap with luxury brands costing $15,000 more (the price of a nice, used Mazda 3 for your 16-year-old).\n\nI revisited the GMC and Mazda two years after they first wowed me in 2016. This time around, I found the all-wheel drive family haulers were a blast over the country roads of Michigan and Virginia. Not only did these 4,000-pounders carry my family in style, but they were fun to drive with taut chassis and peppy turbo-4s. You know, the stuff for which luxury vehicles are known.\n\nI rented the Acadia out of Dulles Airport which returned me to the roads where I tested the GMC in May 2016. If you think GMC is just about trucks, this ute will surprise you.\n\nBased on the same bones that support the Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave, the Acadia went on a 700-pound diet from the previous generation. It shows. In 2016, I chased an Audi A7 cheetah through Virginia's twisted hills, the Acadia showing remarkable poise for a big rhino.\n\nThis time, country roads took me across the West Virginia line near the famed Summit Point racetrack. The Acadia possesses an excellent all-wheel drive system that includes a mode selector with 4x2, 4x4, Snow and Sport. Yes, Sport. Dial in, hold on to the door handles, dearies, and let's go Audi hunting.\n\nMated to GM's excellent 9-speed transmission, the 193-horse 4-cylinder is up to the task. The Mazda, even more so.\n\nTrue to its ZOOM ZOOM lineage, inside every Mazda ute beats the heart of a Miata. The CX-9 takes ute athleticism to the next level.\n\nNot that GMC should hang its head. Car and Driver measured identical G-load numbers for both SUVs in its skid-pad test. That's a remarkable stat for a ute with pickups as parents.\n\nThe Mazda simply manages its heft with more aplomb than the GMC. It also wins on style points. Indeed, CX-9 shames most premium vehicles with its fastback styling and runway-model fascia.\n\nThough less butch than previous generations, the GMC could still use another appointment with the plastic surgeon. Look at younger brother GMC Terrain, one of the lookers of the compact class. A Terrain-like wardrobe for Acadia would match the SUV's upscale, ballroom dance moves.\n\nInside, the GMC steps up its game.\n\nWhile the Mazda struts its handsome European wardrobe of rotary dial, tablet screen and expansive dash, design alone won't get you very far if you get lost in the West Virginia Outback.\n\nMazda continues to be tardy to the smartphone connectivity dance though it promises the popular feature ... um, soon. Just how useful this feature can be was demonstrated by my Acadia.\n\nLike its GM brethren, Acadia was one of the first in segment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. They both work superbly in the GMC's head unit. My experience is that only some luxury models -- BMWs, Mercedes S-class, Acura RDX -- have navigation systems that can compete with smartphones. And who wants to pay big bucks for the privilege?\n\nMy Acadia came with no nav. No problem.\n\nPlug in your iPhone, and bingo! -- the GMC's infotainment system's Google Maps routed us across the wildest of Wild, Wonderful West Virginia. This is every smartphone-user's dream -- no need to upgrade to an (inferior) auto nav feature. No need to learn a new system. Just enter the destination on your phone before leaving the hotel/home/work. Plug. And play.\n\nThe GMC and the Mazda won't win any awards for interior space, but these are big three-row utes. Space comes standard.\n\nMy six-foot-plus sons fit comfortably in the rear of the Acadia where they read books, played computer games, even rested thanks to the GMC's thoughtful recliner (Mazda has a similar feature). The third row is accessible in both the Acadia and Mazda with easy, one step pull-and-slide second row seats (though the Acadia, for budget reasons, only accesses the third row on the curb side). I was cramped, but I'm a 6-foot-5 circus freak, for goodness sake.\n\nWhere the CX-9 shows off details like auto high beams and a head-up display, the Acadia responds with thoughtful items like a rear passenger safety check: Exit the car and the GMC reminds you if you have left something like your computer in the back seat. Or, heaven forbid, a child. Clever.\n\nBut then GMC takes clever too far. Determined to gain EPA's favor, the GMC refuses owners the option of turning off its Stop/Start engine feature. Stop/Start is this decade's equivalent of the 1970s' automatic seat belt. Annoying.\n\nThis is the second Acadia rental I've had with the feature and it grates like fingernails on a chalkboard. It drives my wife crazy. The constant stall at stoplights. BRRRUMP. The constant shudder back to life. BRRUPUP. Sure, GM's Stop-Start is smoother than most, but it's not smooth enough.\n\nMercifully, CX-9 does not come equipped with Stop/Start. The minor fuel savings are not worth the expense. Like GMC's decision to only equip the curbside second row with third-row access.\n\nOn such small details can buyers' purchase decisions hang. Maybe the GMC's smartphone capability seals the deal for Acadia. Maybe the Mazda's sexy styling flips your switch.\n\nEither way, the details pale in comparison to that $15,000 it'll cost you to buy a comparable luxury ute. Maybe that premium badge buys status -- but as Acadia and CX-9 prove, it doesn't buy you a better chariot.\n\nHenry Payne is auto critic for The Detroit News.

He has also said he's a fan of Honey Nut Cheerios.\n\nThe most common breakfasts among this year's American Olympians included oatmeal, eggs and smoothies that give them the nutrients, protein, sugar and overall energy to perform at their best.\n\nHere's a more in-depth look at what this year's team members are digging into to start their day:\n\n1.

All I care about now is the truth.'\n\nYet at the time Keefe D still refused to name the killer, saying that he was 'going to keep it for the code of the streets'.\n\n'It just came from the backseat bro,' he added.\n\nBut now Keefe D has finally revealed it was Anderson, sitting in the backseat just as he said, who ultimately pulled the trigger.\n\nAnderson, who always denied he murdered Tupac, was killed in a shootout in Los Angeles two years later.\n\nKyle Long, the executive producer of Unsolved, is now calling for the Las Vegas police department to pursue Keefe D, according to the Daily Star.\n\n'He went live on television and confessed to being an accessory to murder and the Las Vegas PD, as far as I know, is doing nothing about it,' said Long.\n\n'I just think it's outrageous.'\n\nKeefe D's confession seems to put an end to the numerous theories that have swirled around Tupac's death for more than two decades.\n\nMany had blamed fellow rapper the Notorious B.I.G, also known as Biggie Smalls, and the infamous East Coast/West Coast rivalry between their record labels.\n\nOthers believed it was really Knight, then the CEO of Death Row Records, who was supposed to die that night.\n\nSome even claimed it was Knight himself who had put a hit on Tupac.\n\nBut, in the end, it all came down to gang rivalry.\n\n'It was simple retaliation,' an LAPD insider told People. 'You mess with one of ours, we will mess with one of yours.\n\n'If Orlando had never been jumped in the hotel, they never would have killed Tupac that night.'\n\nWhile Tupac's death has long remained a mystery, some have always believed that both he and Knight knew who was responsible.\n\nWhen a police officer asked Tupac who pulled the trigger, the rapper simply replied 'F**k you' as he lay bleeding on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nSome have theorized that Tupac, who had survived a shooting just two years before, thought he would live to see the day he could get revenge his own way.\n\n'My belief is they both knew,' Dan Long, a Las Vegas Police Department detective, told People.\n\n'The cars were two or three feet apart when the shooting occurred. Tupac was the passenger and he would have been right up against him in an extremely well-lit part of town.'\n\nNo one has ever been charged in Tupac's death."]}, "Telefonica": {"2018-07-19": ["Exclusive: Petrobras sets next bid round for TAG pipeline to late March - sources\n\nBy Carolina Mandl, Tatiana Bautzer and Gram Slattery\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Three distressed asset funds have sued for the right to participate in a 4 billion reais ($1 billion) capital increase for Brazilian telecom Oi SA as part of its in-court restructuring, four sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week.\n\nThe fight for the chance to invest in Oi, Brazil's largest fixed line carrier, reveals a sharp turnaround in investors' perception of a company that flirted with liquidation a year ago.

Image: EQRoy/Shutterstock\n\nIf renting a two-bedroom apartment is a barometer, soaring rent levels will have an impact on Dublin's ability to attract and retain young tech talent.\n\nLast week Statista published a graph indicating which cities in the world were the most expensive when it came to renting a two-bedroom apartment.\n\nThe figures, based on Deutsche Bank's recent annual survey of global prices and living standards found that Hong Kong was the most expensive with someone working in the city being expected to fork out $3,700 every month.\n\nThis was closely followed by San Francisco ($3,664), New York ($2,854), Paris ($2,483) and London ($2,410).\n\nMissing from the chart was Dublin but latest figures from property website Daft show that average rental prices in Dublin have hit a record high of \u20ac1,875 per month which is by today's exchange rate (19 July) equal to $2,176, not far behind London.\n\nImage: Statista\n\nLast week the CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) Conor O'Kelly told the D\u00e1il Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that there was a clear \"market failure\" in Ireland.\n\nO'Kelly said he agreed with the assertion that the current cost of housing and apartments available for rent is unsustainable and that it is impossible for people on the industrial wage and others earning up to \u20ac50,000 to find homes.\n\nAt the current trajectory, it is likely that the average cost of renting a home in Dublin could hit \u20ac2,000 by the end of the year. That's $2,322 US dollars. At that rate you're almost in New York and hurtling towards San Francisco.\n\nGilt or guilt?\n\nDublin is a boom town for technology and for the best part of the last decade one of the reasons it became a go-to location for Europe's young tech talent was proximity to Europe, a fun lifestyle and affordability.\n\nIt was a virtuous circle: as well as highly-educated locals, young Europeans with tech and language skills could earn well and live well, still be within an hour or two's flight from home, and this would attract more companies to locate and invest in Ireland.\n\nAs I have pointed out before, Dublin is now at risk at becoming less fun and less fair and is in danger of becoming a mini-San Francisco in terms of living costs and a tech ecosystem blind to what's happening on the streets outside their gilt-edged ivory towers with free gyms and free food and other lavish perks.\n\nBut foreign workers are taking notice of Dublin's rising costs of living. According to a salary survey last year by Prosperity Recruitment, in 2016 and preceding years, the recruiter had a rejection rate of approximately 15pc on job offers to candidates living abroad, but, by the third quarter of 2017, that had doubled to nearly 30pc.\n\nIn a recent report, Growing Great Teams in Ireland: The Role of the Residential Rental Sector, co-written with Ronan Lyons of Trinity College Dublin, the American Chamber of Commerce warned that the availability of quality and affordable accommodation is having a direct impact on the hiring of talent.\n\nFortunately for many tech workers, they are highly paid, and some employers like the Web Summit in May announced new measures including a subsidy equating to around a month's rent or a mortgage payment for employees who choose to live within 2km of its headquarters in Dublin 6.\n\nIf this becomes a standard mechanism for employers it will accelerate Dublin's race to the bottom in the eyes of the city's legions of non-tech workers, most of whom endure on the industrial wage.\n\nThe implication is Dublin could soon become a city only for lavishly paid tech workers. The Docklands Residential Report 2018 published by the Owen Reilly agency, which assists Dublin tech companies with lettings for employees, revealed that almost half of the renters in the desirable Silicon Docks area of Dublin are tech workers. In fact, 92pc of people who live in that area are from overseas\n\nAlready in San Francisco, workers would need to be earning at least $216,129 a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment.\n\nIf Dublin becomes a city where people on the industrial wage or on up to \u20ac50,000 cannot afford to live, the plot has indeed become lost.\n\nThere is evidence that regional cities like Limerick and large towns are taking up the slack, combining affordability with a higher quality of life and this is proving attractive to incoming tech companies.\n\nLast week Skout, a cybersecurity company, revealed plans to create 30 new jobs at an EMEA HQ in Laois while just a week before that Nueda Technologies revealed plans to hire 200 people in Athlone at a new software engineering hub in Athlone and Phibro revealed plans to hire 150 at a new biotech facility in Sligo.\n\nDublin may be a boomtown for tech, but it is nowhere near the scale of cities like New York, London or Paris, and has nothing like the infrastructure to match. It is 2018 and it doesn't even have an underground metro.\n\nSomething is broken and it needs to be fixed fast. Because if young workers, not just those working in tech, cannot afford to live there, then the city will lose its soul and the vibrancy that has made it so special.\n\nPink houses on South Dock Street (Sraid an Duga Theas) in Dublin.This neighborhood is home to the Google European headquarters. Image: EQRoy/Shutterstock", "The German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA) retroactively reversed a \u20ac4,000 environmental bonus that many Tesla Model S buyers had already received, based on a technicality.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is a stipulation in the Guideline on the Promotion of Sales of Electric Vehicles that mandates that the base model of vehicles eligible for the environmental subsidy must be available for customers to purchase for under \u20ac60,000. They have to be able to take delivery of such a trim in order to be eligible for the bonus. Half of the bonus is provided by the government and half of the bonus is paid by the manufacturer.\n\nThe government alleges that Tesla was not allowing customers to order and take delivery of the lowest optioned Tesla Model S, which would make all of its Model S vehicles ineligible for the bonus. This was discovered in late 2017, and after an investigation, the Model S was removed from the list of vehicles eligible for the environmental bonus on November 30th, 2017.\n\nBAFA claims that it was not until March 6th, 2018 that the base model configuration of the Model S was made available to customers. Ironically, this nuance penalizes Tesla owners who purchased higher trimmed models and paid a premium to drive electric.\n\nTesla had been in negotiations with the regulatory body in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, but unfortunately for Tesla's customers, no agreement was reached by early July, as required. The result: Tesla's customers that purchased a Model S in the contested period will have to pay back the full \u20ac4,000 subsidy.\n\nBAFA clarified the terms of the reversal (via Google Translate):\n\n\"The reversal affects all Tesla customers who purchased the 'Tesla Model S' before March 6, 2018. This includes around 800 procedures in which the environmental bonus has already been approved. In addition, this includes around 250 procedures that were initially postponed due to the unclear facts in the processing and must now be rejected.\"\n\nBAFA's ruling ends with a note that as of March 6th, 2018, buyers of a Tesla Model S are eligible for the rebate, followed by a link to apply for it online.\n\nIn typical Tesla format, it is jumping in the way of the oncoming train to protect its customers, for the time being. A Tesla spokesperson shared with CleanTechnica the following statement:\n\n\"The arbitrary decision to temporarily remove Tesla from the list of vehicles eligible for the Environmental Bonus (Umweltbonus) was unjustified, contrary to the stated goals of the program, and unfair to our customers. The fact that Tesla was included on the list, removed from the list, and then again added to the list is proof that this was a mistake. As our website demonstrates, anyone in Germany has always been able to order a base version Model S that was below the required price level, and we have delivered such cars to customers.\"\n\nThis is the best interim solution one could hope for, given the unfortunate series of events that led to more than 1,000 Tesla customers potentially losing out on a \u20ac4,000 rebate. Let's hope that Tesla and BAFA are able to come to a mutually agreeable resolution. Otherwise, Tesla may be eating BAFA's \u20ac2.1 million share of the bonuses on a technicality.", "By: Trends Desk | New Delhi | Updated: July 19, 2018 1:25:39 pm Aakash Chopra posted a photo of the receipt as a proof of the money he had to shell on basic Indian dishes like paneer tikka, paneer butter, veg kebab, among others.

And that technique -- known as \"spear phishing -- remains a threat not just to campaign officials but to employees and consumers.\n\nSpear phishing is a scam in which cyber criminals pose as trusted sources and send phony electronic messages to targeted individuals to trick them into revealing sensitive information.\n\nIn the case of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, it was a misleading email that looked like a security notification from Google, asking Podesta to change his password by clicking an embedded link, according to the indictment filed Friday. Podesta followed the email's instructions, changing his password and giving hackers access to 50,000 of his emails.\n\nBut spear fishing could come in the form of an email that appears to come from your boss, asking you to send your W2 form. Or a message with an expected invoice, requesting that you wire the money to an account controlled by bad actors.\n\n\"The indictment really illustrates the many uses this technology can be put,\" said Edward McAndrew, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor and co-leader of Ballard Spahr's privacy and data security group in Philadelphia. \"It's not just about stealing someone's personal information. It's about financial fraud, or in this instance, even election fraud.\"\n\nHow it's done\n\nIn typical phishing scams, cybercriminals send blanket emails to a large swath of users, hoping someone will take the bait and download an infected attachment or click a link to a phony website.\n\nSpear phishing scams, by contrast, are tailored to specific targets. Hackers will research an individual ahead of time, scanning social media accounts and public information to learn a person's job, friends or interests to craft a trustworthy email.\n\n\"They'll figure out where you work and who your colleagues are and try to send a fake email that looks like it's from one of your colleagues,\" said Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and founder of Paoli-based DuckDuckGo, an internet search engine that doesn't track or store user data.\n\nThat's what happened Tuesday at Weinberg's company. One of his employees received an email from a sender using Weinberg's name asking, \"I need you to help run a task. Let me know if you're unoccupied,\" according to a copy of the message. The sender posing as Weinberg wanted to \"gift out some Apple Gift Cards to some clients.\" Weinberg and his colleague didn't bite.\n\nThe person pretending to be Weinberg used an email address that wasn't even close to resembling the real thing. But Michael Levy, the chief of computer crimes for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia, said cyber criminals will typically create email addresses that are nearly identical to those of trusted sources, sneaking in an extra letter or using a zero instead of a capital \"O,\" for example.\n\nIn some cases, such as the Russian hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, spear phishing emails will direct users to phony websites, where victims will enter their credentials and unwittingly give hackers their usernames and passwords. In the DCCC case, Russian agents then installed malware on at least 10 of the committee's computers, according to the indictment, allowing them to monitor individual employees' computer activity, steal passwords and maintain access to the DCCC network.\n\n\"There are two ways to get into computers,\" Levy said. \"There is the sophisticated hacking where you figure out how to break through a security system ... [or] you attack the weakest link in the security system, and that's the user.\"\n\nOnce hackers have access to a company's email system, \"they will sit and watch to learn as much as they can about people,\" Levy said, adding that cyber criminals can glean anything from employees' email habits to the name of the company president's wife.\n\nMcAndrew, of Ballard Spahr, said once hackers gain entry to an email account, they can peruse a user's messages, work calendars and contacts, as if someone is \"virtually looking over their shoulders.\"\n\n\"You're able to know about events before they happen by reading about them,\" McAndrew said. \"You know what's coming up.\"\n\nHackers aware of an upcoming payment can pounce by sending spear phishing emails to trick recipients into wiring money to accounts under the hackers' control, McAndrew said.\n\nVictims of internet crimes suffered more than $1.4 billion in losses in 2017, almost doubling since 2013, according to an FBI report on the issue released in May. Crimes listed as \"business email compromise/email account compromise\" accounted for more than $676 million of that 2017 total, representing the largest category of loss.\n\nHow to protect yourself\n\nOne way to reduce the risk from spear phishing is use multi-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just a username and password, but knowledge or possession of something that only that user has, such as a code sent to a cell phone.\n\n\"Even if you get tricked and you go to some bogus site and type in your password, it will be useless without\" the other piece of information, said Anthony Vance, director of Temple University's Center for Cybersecurity.\n\nVance suggested using twofactorauth.org, which tells users whether websites support multi-factor authentication. Major services such as Google or Yahoo allow users to activate the service.\n\nExperts said individuals should use some common sense too. Resist the urge to click links or attachments from an unknown source or unexpected message. Check with colleagues before responding to a suspicious email.\n\n\"The number one thing people can do is scrutinize every single email they receive,\" McAndrew said.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Facebook announced several new hires of top academics in the field of artificial intelligence Tuesday, among them a roboticist known for her work at Disney making animated figures move in more human-like ways.\n\nThe hires raise a big question - why is Facebook interested in robots, anyway?\n\nIt's not as though the social media giant is suddenly interested in developing mechanical friends, although it does use robotic arms in some of its data centers. The answer is even more central to the problem of how AI systems work today.\n\nThis photo provided by Facebook shows Yann LeCun. Facebook is announcing several academic hires in artificial intelligence, including Carnegie Mellon researcher Jessica Hodgins, who's known for her work making animated figures move in more human-like ways. Yann LeCun, Facebook's chief AI scientist, says some of the best ideas for getting AI systems to learn faster and with less data are coming from the field of robotics. (Facebook via AP)\n\nToday, most successful AI systems have to be exposed to millions of data points labeled by humans - like, say, photos of cats - before they can learn to recognize patterns that people take for granted. Similarly, game-playing bots like Google's computerized Go master AlphaGo Zero require tens of thousands of trials to learn the best moves from their failures.\n\nCreating systems that require less data and have more common sense is a key goal for making AI smarter in the future.\n\n\"Clearly we're missing something in terms of how humans can learn so fast,\" Yann LeCun, Facebook's chief AI scientist, said in a call with reporters last week. \"So far the best ideas have come out of robotics.\"\n\nAmong the people Facebook is hiring are Jessica Hodgins , the former Disney researcher; and Abhinav Gupta, her colleague at Carnegie Mellon University who is known for using robot arms to learn how to grasp things.\n\nPieter Abbeel, a roboticist at University of California, Berkeley and co-founder of the robot-training company Covariant.ai, says the robotics field has benefits and constraints that push progress in AI. For one, the real world is naturally complex, so robotic AI systems have to deal with unexpected, rare events. And real-world constraints like a lack of time and the cost of keeping machinery moving push researchers to solve difficult problems.\n\n\"Robotics forces you into many reality checks,\" Abbeel said. \"How good are these algorithms, really?\"\n\nThere are other more abstract applications of learnings from robotics, says Berkeley AI professor Ken Goldberg. Just like teaching a robot to escape from a computerized maze, other robots change their behavior depending on whether actions they took got them closer to a goal. Such systems could even be adapted to serve ads, he said - which just happens to be the mainstay of Facebook's business.\n\n\"It's not a static decision, it's a dynamic one,\" Goldberg said.\n\nIn an interview, Hodgins expressed an interest in a wide range of robotics research, everything from building a \"compelling humanoid robot\" to creating a mechanical servant to \"load and unload my dishwasher.\"\n\nWhile she acknowledged the need to imbue robots with more common sense and have them learn with fewer examples, she also said her work in animation could lead to a new form of sharing - one in which AI-powered tools could help one show off a work of pottery in 3-D, for example.\n\n\"One thing I hope we'll be able to do is explore AI support for creativity,\" she said.\n\nFor Facebook, planting a flag in the hot field also allows it to be competitive for AI talent emerging from universities, Facebook's LeCun said.\n\nBart Selman, a Cornell computer science professor AI expert, said it's a good idea for Facebook to broaden its reach in AI and take on projects that might not be directly related to the company's business - something that's a little more \"exciting\" - the way Google did with self-driving cars, for example.\n\nThis attracts not just attention, but students, too. The broader the research agenda, the better the labs become, he said.\n\n___\n\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in New York contributed to this report.\n\nThis photo provided by Facebook shows Jessica Hodgins.

Seventy per cent of her heart tissue was dead.\n\nBed-ridden and unable to move, she had no idea that Stefan Henze, a 35-year-old former silver medallist slalom canoeist turned coach for the German team had died, casting a shadow over the whole Summer Games.\n\nBut now, five weeks after her transplant operation, the grandmother-of-five tells MailOnline of her eternal gratitude to his family, who 'readily' agreed for his healthy organs to be donated.\n\nIvonette Nascimento Balthazar (left, with her daughter) had been waiting 18 months for a transplant and by the time of the operation, 70 per cent of her heart tissue was dead\n\n'I knew I was living my final days,' she tells MailOnline. 'I couldn't breathe anymore lying down.' Pictured: With Dr Jaqueline Miranda, the National Cardiology Institute's transplant coordinator, post operation\n\nStefan Henze, 35, died three days after suffering serious head injuries in a collision in a taxi while returning to the Olympic Park in the first week of the competition\n\n'It is incredible to think that the same heart that is inside me once beat fast with the emotion of winning an Olympic silver medal,' she says.\n\n'But my happiness will always be tinged with sadness because of their loss. I worry so much for his family, how they are doing, what they are going through.'\n\nHenze, 35, died three days after suffering serious head injuries in a collision in a taxi while returning with a colleague to the Olympic Park in the first week of the competition.\n\nHis death prompted an outpouring of sorrow, but his tragic death came to mean quite the opposite for Ivonette - her last and only chance at life.\n\nWith 80 per cent of patients not surviving past the first year on the waiting list, Ivonette's time was quickly running out.\n\nIn her exclusive chat to MailOnline, an emotional Ivonette frequently breaks down in tears as she remembers the 'extraordinary generosity' of Stefan's family towards her, a total stranger.\n\nDoctors say that Ivonette's new heart is doing really well and is in perfect condition because Henze was so fit and heathly. Pictured: The tragic star (right) celebrating his 2004 silver medal\n\nIvonette pays tribute to the 'extraordinary generosity' of Henze's family towards her, a total stranger. Pictured: The athlete (right) competing in Athens in 2004 where he won silver\n\nHer daughter Renata only realised whose heart her mother was getting after she had gone into surgery. She has written to the Henze family to say thank you\n\n'I still can't get my head around it,' she says. 'Thinking about it, they should have been angry, that he died so cheaply, in a traffic accident in a foreign, developing country.\n\n'But despite losing the man they loved, they still agreed on this act of love, to give the gift of life to someone they didn't even know. I weep every time I think about it, it's hard to take in.'\n\n'I so want to meet with Stefan's family and hug them, and tell them how thankful I am. I know nothing I could ever say or do would ever repay them for what they did. They gave me my life back.'\n\nOne time a group of students examined me, and they couldn't find my heartbeat. It was so faint and so slow. Ivonette\n\nIronically, Ivonette was against her home city Rio de Janeiro hosting the Olympic Games - because she thought the money should have been better spent on health services.\n\nShe said: 'I felt like a lot of Brazilians, that it was wrong to spend so much money when so many public services were suffering.\n\n'It ended up being an Olympics I will never forget, one which changed my life perhaps more than anyone else involved.\n\n'But I still have conflicting feelings, because I also know that for me to be given this gift, someone's life was cut short far too early.'\n\nHer daughter Renata, 31, said the family had been waiting for a miracle: 'The whole family were seeing my mum getting worse by the day, and we were desperate for a heart to become available in time.\n\n'Our lives were standing still. Every day we woke up hoping it would be the day. We didn't even leave the city bounds for fear o not being around when the phone call came. But with each day that passed we got more worried it would never come.'\n\nFifteen days after her transplant, Ivonette managed to walk around the hospital ward on her own for the first time. Pictured: Ivonette shortly after her life-saving surgery\n\nBefore she fell ill, Ivonette had set up her own successful HR company in Rio but the company collapsed after an unpaid bill triggered its downfall. She had a heart attack soon afterwards\n\nDescribed as a warrior by Renata and son Fabio, 43, Ivonette was forced to find work to support her family after her husband left home while they were still teenagers.\n\nAfter several years working for others, she eventually set up her own human resources company in Rio which went on to become a market leader and employ over 500 people.\n\nBut aged 54 the failure of a client to pay their bill set in motion a sequence of events which ended with the dramatic collapse of the company.\n\nI knew I was living my final days. I couldn't move around, I had to sleep upright because I couldn't breathe anymore lying down. I cut my hair short because I couldn't lift my arms to brush my hair. Ivonette\n\nIvonette, who has five grandchildren, believes the stress of losing everything she had worked for contributed to the onset of her heart problems, which culminated in a heart attack in September 2012.\n\nShe says: 'It was a terrible time. I'd been healthy and active for all of my life, but then I started to get peaks of high blood pressure.\n\n'One evening I was getting ready to go out with friends and I started to feel sick, pains in my stomach. I Googled my symptoms and I realised I was having a heart attack. I called my son and he rushed me to hospital.'\n\nBut despite several courses of treatment at Rio's specialist National Cardiology Institute, Ivonette's condition gradually worsened, until doctors broke the news that her heart had suffered irreversible damage.\n\nShe remembers: 'One time a group of students examined me, and they couldn't find my heartbeat. It was so faint and so slow.\n\n'Three years after my heart attack a doctor sat me down and told me that the treatment had failed. They told me my only hope was a new heart.\n\n'I sobbed and sobbed, out of desperation. I thought that this was it, that I'd never get through it. I'd never heard of anyone having a heart transplant, it seemed impossible. I wanted to jump off the roof.'\n\nThree years after her heart attack, Ivonette was told the damage to her heart was irreversible and that she would need a donor. Several fell through before she was helped by Henze\n\nDr Miranda says the Henze family 'had no hesitation' when they were approached about the possibility of donating Stefan's organs. Pictured: Stefan Henze (second left) celebrating silver\n\nIvonette was put on the heart donor waiting list in February last year - and when she arrived at first in the queue earlier this year she and her family were put on constant alert for the phone call which could transform her life.\n\nBut the call never came, apart from a false alarm in March, when she was rushed to the hospital ready for the transplant, only for doctors to discover that the heart wasn't healthy enough, damaging their expectations further.\n\nBy the time the Olympic Games kicked off at the beginning of last month, Ivonette's body was rapidly shutting down - and her family knew only a miracle would save her.\n\n'I knew I was living my final days,' she says. 'I couldn't move around, I couldn't talk more than a few words without losing my breath. I had to sleep upright because I couldn't breathe anymore lying down. I cut my hair short because I couldn't lift my arms to brush my hair.\n\n'I had no energy for anything. When the Olympics started I didn't watch any of the sports because even watching TV made me feel sick. My heart had almost stopped. My life was draining out of me.'\n\nHer family, meanwhile, desperately clung on to the hope that a heart would be found.\n\nWhen a National Force soldier providing security for the Games was shot in the head by gangsters after the army truck he was in mistakenly drove into a favela slum, they believed their prayers for a healthy heart had finally been answered.\n\nReanat tells MailOnline: 'The first thing that came to my head was, 'what generosity, from a family who live a long way away, to give away the man's heart to someone who needs it'\n\nAs well as his heart, the athlete's liver and both kidneys were also successfully transplanted, saving the lives of three other people. Pictured: Henze (right) competing in slalom canoe\n\nBut although they were asked to consider donating the young soldier's heart, his family refused.\n\nIt was three days later when, after so many dashed hopes, Ivonette received the news that a heart had become available.\n\nShe recalls: 'My son drove me there in 15 minutes. I was crying all the way. I knew it was my only hope of life, but I also knew it could be my last day, because I might not survive the operation. At the same time I couldn't quite believe it, I had been let down so many times before.'\n\nThe doctors who do my check ups say that my heart is doing really well, and is in perfect condition, because clearly Stefan was fit and heathly. Ivonette\n\nToo preoccupied with their mother's state of health, none of the family had heard about the accident involving Stefan Henze, which had made headlines around the world.\n\nDaughter Renata remembers: 'I was waiting while my mother was in surgery and listening to the news, and they were reporting how the heart of this German coach was leaving the hospital where he had died to save the life of someone who needed a transplant.\n\n'And I was there with my mother who was undergoing a heart transplant. I knew it must be his heart.\n\n'The first thing that came to my head was, 'what generosity, from a family who live a long way away, to give away the man's heart to someone who needs it'. I was overwhelmed.\n\n'As soon as mum woke up after the operation I told her. She burst into tears and started shouting, 'find someone from this family, so I can give them a hug!'.\n\n'That afternoon I wrote a letter to Stefan's family, which I gave to the German embassy to give to them. I asked for God to comfort their family, and told them that I didn't know how to thank them for what they had done. I poured out my heart to them so they would know how grateful we are.'\n\nDr Jaqueline Miranda says: 'We approached the family, knowing there were people in Rio who needed his organs, and they readily agreed to donate them'\n\nIvonette is now able to do things that she has not been able to do for years, like enjoy time with her grandchildren. Pictured: With Dr Miranda\n\nDr Jaqueline Miranda, the National Cardiology Institute's transplant coordinator, said the Henze family - who had flown to Rio after the accident - 'had no hesitation' when they were approached about the possibility of donating Stefan's organs.\n\nAs well as his heart, the athlete's liver and both kidneys were also successfully transplanted, saving the lives of three other people.\n\nShe says: 'We approached the family, knowing there were people in Rio who needed his organs, and they readily agreed to donate them.\n\n'I think I could manage to do a run one day. It would be a good way of honouring the memory of the man who I owe me life to. Ivonette\n\n'There was no hesitation. They were devastated by his death, but desired that his death helped save the lives of others.'\n\nRemembering the moment she discovered the story behind her new heart, Ivonette breaks down in tears again.\n\nShe says: 'It doesn't matter to me that he was an Olympic medal winner. Even if it had been a simple, normal person they would have saved me life in the same way.\n\n'I would like to meet them and thank them in person, for giving me back my life. The least I can do is embrace them. But only when I'm stronger, because if it happened now I'm not sure I'd cope with the emotion.'\n\n'My happiness will always be tinged with sadness because of [the Henze family's] loss.' she says. 'I worry so much for his family, how they are doing, what they are going through.'\n\nIvonette has been supported throughout by her daughter Renata, 31, and Fabio, 43, who she supported after their father left when they were teenagers\n\nShe says that, slowly but surely, she is recovering her strength and health. Fifteen days after her transplant, she wept with family members after managing to walk around the hospital ward on her own for the first time.\n\nAnd with the heart of an Olympian beating inside her, she is even planning on running a marathon next year.\n\nShe says: 'The recovery has been slow and difficult, but every day I'm feeling the strength come back to me. I'm taking one day at a time, enjoying being able to spend time with my grandchildren and do things I hadn't been able to do for a long time.\n\n'The doctors who do my check ups say that my heart is doing really well, and is in perfect condition, because clearly Stefan was fit and heathly.\n\n'I think I could manage to do a run one day.

According to The Wall Street Journal (Via The Verge), the device will cost around $300 and will be marketed as a high-end music player.\n\nThis fits in with comments from Samsung Mobile chief DJ Koh made in February where he said Samsung expected to release a premium Bixby-powered smart speaker alongside the Galaxy Note 9.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says the speaker will be bowl-shaped with legs on the bottom and lights on top (hope those lights are shaped like eyes for the proper Batteries Not Included experience). It will also apparently have a sound shifting feature that will be able to play audio in the direction of the person talking to it, so it may seem like it responds more directly rather than speaking \"to the room.\"\n\nThe speaker will presumably use the upcoming Bixby version 2.0. The new version of Samsung's AI assistant has long been rumored to feature on the Galaxy Note 9, so it would make a lot of sense that the speaker would also come with the latest version (if they launch simultaneously).\n\nWhile previous rumors suggested Samsung would release different versions of its smart speaker at different prices, this wasn't mentioned by The Wall Street Journal in the latest report. However, considering both Google and Amazon have released cheaper versions of their respective smart speakers, it wouldn't be surprising if Samsung eventually does the same.\n\nIf the $300 price-tag is correct, the speaker would be competing with -- although slightly cheaper than -- high-end devices such as the Apple HomePod ($349.99) and Google Home Max ($399). As well as a more attractive price, Samsung could give its speaker an edge by integrating its wealth of existing products.\n\nSamsung will have to convince people that its Bixby Assistant is the one that they want to have in their homes, however. Considering the popularity of Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant, this could be the toughest hurdle to overcome.", "Liulishuo, an app that teaches English to Chinese students, is planning an initial public offering in the US.\n\nBEIJING: Liulishuo, an app that teaches English to Chinese students, is planning an initial public offering in the US as it seeks to expand in the competitive business of online education, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe company is planning to list as soon as the fourth quarter, the people said, requesting not to be identified discussing private matters. It's looking to raise as much as US$300 million, one of the people said. Known also as LingoChamp, the company is targeting a valuation of about US$2 billion, another person said. The targeted valuation and IPO size could both change, the people said.\n\nOnline education is big business in China, thanks to an increasingly affluent middle class and a job market that prizes both education and English-language proficiency. Shanghai-based Liulishuo uses artificial intelligence systems, rather than humans, to teach English. It records a pupil's speech patterns before offering lessons and tips on how to sound more like a native English speaker.\n\nLiulishuo, whose name is Mandarin for \"speaking fluently,\" was co-founded in 2012 by Wang Yi, a Princeton graduate and former product manager at Google. Liulishuo had more than 45 million registered users as of July, according to its website, and counts GGV, IDG Capital and Cherubic Ventures as its backers.\n\nWang didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company runs on a so-called freemium model that gives away basic lessons and charges for more advanced services.

Recently the agency also widened the range of cases for which it could begin the process of removing foreign nationals to include those whose immigration benefits, such as work status, have been denied.\n\nThe measures are likely to disproportionately affect those whose applications require large amounts of supporting evidence, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Employees with H-1B visas -- mostly held by people in the technology, science and medicine industries -- are currently often asked to respond to a request for evidence from USCIS to prove whether they are qualified for their work, or whether their job is considered a specialty occupation, Pierce added.\n\nThe number of applications for H-1B visas has far exceeded the 85,000 annual cap on awards in recent fiscal years (Bloomberg)\n\nThe updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency,\" Pierce said. The USCIS in February updated its mission statement to remove reference to the U.S. as a \"nation of immigrants\" and instead included language on \"protecting Americans\" and \"securing the homeland.\"\n\nIn April, the USCIS said it received 105,000 more H-1B applications than it can grant, according to a National Foundation for American Policy report. Still, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and other U.S. tech giants saw an increase in the number of H-1B applications approved in 2017.\n\nH-1B Visa: The updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency\"\n\nThe recent move by USCIS \"creates traps\" for individuals already working legally in the country -- or seeking to work here -- by upping the consequences for clerical errors, said Todd Schulte, president of immigration reform lobbying group Fwd.us, which was founded by technology leaders including Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston.\n\nAnd it could affect more than just tech companies, Schulte said. \"Cracking down on legal immigration is simply this: It's encouraging innovation and job growth to happen someplace else.\" Microsoft Corp. expanded its Vancouver office several years ago, in part due to Canada's more lax visa regulations.\n\nThe updated USCIS policies add a layer of instability for employers. \"There's a chance that not only is the case going to be denied, but also that the beneficiary could be placed in removal proceedings,\" said Hassan Ahmad, managing attorney with the HMA law firm. \"How can you do business with this type of uncertainty?\"\n\nUSCIS spokesman Michael Bars said the policy changes are part of an effort to help \"cut down on frivolous applications, reduce waste, and help ensure legitimate, law abiding petitioners aren't undermined by those able to game our system.\"\n\nThe number of requests for evidence to H-1B visa petitions rose 45 percent for the period of Jan.1 to Aug. 31, 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to a report by Reuters. Given the volume of the requests, \"it may seem like it would be a natural option\" for USCIS officers to want to leverage the new policies to avoid issuing additional RFE's, said Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But without the requests for evidence, applicants don't have an opportunity to explain themselves if they make a mistake that could be as minor as writing their work address incorrectly on an application, she said.", "Rolls-Royce said that it plans to create a flying taxi prototype within the next 18 months (AFP)\n\nAutonomous vehicles have only just begun to navigate our streets and already the world's innovators are setting their sights on the next big transportation trend.\n\nFlying taxis.\n\nUber plans to create a network of flying taxis in Dubai and the Dallas area by the year 2020.

The vehicle could carry as many as five passengers at speeds up to 250 miles per hour for approximately 500 miles, according to Rolls-Royce.\n\nRolls-Royce said the vehicle could be airborne as soon as the early 2020s, but the company said it plans to create a vehicle prototype within the next 18 months.\n\nOur hybrid electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) program will revolutionize the way we travel and the way we build cities in this fast-changing world.

Referring to Rolls-Royce as \"pioneers,\" Watson added that the company was among the first to develop turbo-prop and jet engines.\n\nRolls-Royce Motor Cars - a company owned by German car manufacturer BMW - is not associated with the effort to create flying taxis.\n\nThe company said its concept vehicle would be powered by six electric propulsors \"specially designed to have a low noise profile.\" To take off or land vertically, the company said, the vehicle's wings would rotate 90 degrees. Once the craft reaches its cruising height, its vehicle's propellers would fold away and the craft would rely on several rear propellers for thrust.\n\nAn attendee watches a digital display of a Rolls-Royce concept hybrid-electric air vehicle at the Farnborough International Airshow in Britain on Monday, July 16, 2018 (Bloomberg)\n\nRolls-Royce said the vehicle would fill a niche created by overtaxed transportation systems in increasingly crowded cities. Watson told Agence France-Presse that he envisions an electric version of the vehicle moving passengers around a city but a hybrid propulsion system carrying passengers longer distances, such as between London and Paris. The company noted that the vehicle could be adapted for military purposes as well, though no detail was provided.\n\n\"Electrification is an exciting and inescapable trend across industrial technology markets and while the move to more electric propulsion will be gradual for us, it will ultimately be a revolution,\" Watson said.\n\nDavid Stewart - an aviation and aerospace adviser and partner at Oliver Wyman - told AFP that the aerospace environmental industry is reacting to a push to become less reliant on fossil fuels.\n\n\"I think that electrical propulsion is a potential disruptor to the way things are powered,\" Stewart said. \"We are quite a long way for electrical power to be a replacement for kerosene, but never say never.\"", "Zuckerberg said Facebook has a responsibility to curb the viral spread of hoaxes.\n\nFacebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently defended the company's decision to keep on its platform the site Infowars, a prominent right-wing outlet known for spreading conspiracy theories and baseless information.\n\nZuckerberg said in an interview published by Recode on Wednesday that Facebook has a responsibility to curb the viral spread of hoaxes and blatant misinformation. But he maintained Facebook should not ban publishers for spreading false claims, a position he described as \"too extreme.\"\n\n\"The approach that we've taken to false news is not to say, you can't say something wrong on the Internet,\" he said. \"Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that.\"\n\nFacebook's relationship with Infowars has come under heightened scrutiny in recent days. The social network touted its increased efforts to combat misinformation at an event with journalists. But a CNN reporter asked Facebook how it could reconcile this beefed-up approach with allowing a known purveyor of false conspiracies to maintain a popular page on the platform. According to CNN, the head of Facebook's News Feed, John Hegeman, replied by saying Facebook doesn't take down false news.\n\nZuckerberg said if people flag posts as potential hoaxes, Facebook will send the content to fact-checkers who can verify the claims. If the posts are false, Facebook will \"significantly reduce the distribution of that content\" in the News Feed, he said.\n\n\"Reducing the distribution of misinformation - rather than removing it outright - strikes the right balance between free expression and a safe and authentic community,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday. The company said that in coming months it will change its policies to allow the social network to remove certain types of misinformation that contribute to physical harm.\n\nZuckerberg, who is Jewish, also said people who deny the Holocaust happened should be allowed to stay on the social network, too. \"I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong,\" he said. Zuckerberg added it's difficult to understand a person's intent. He said Facebook shouldn't ban people from the network even if they spread false information on multiple occasions.\n\nZuckerberg later clarified to Recode on Wednesday afternoon, \"I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that.\"\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, challenged Facebook's policy on holocaust denialism. \"Holocaust denial is a willful, deliberate and long-standing deception tactic by anti-Semites that is incontrovertibly hateful, hurtful, and threatening to Jews,\" he said in statement Wednesday. \"ADL will continue to challenge Facebook on this position and call on them to regard Holocaust denial as a violation of their community guidelines.\"\n\nLawmakers in Washington have also expressed frustration with how Facebook's decides what content can exist on its network. At a congressional hearing Tuesday, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter were pressed to clarify the way they police their massive platforms and to articulate how they define false news.\n\nWhen asked about Infowars, Facebook's head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, said Facebook removes all content \"that violates our policies,\" but added that Facebook can remove an entire page or profile at a certain point. She did not explain what that threshold looks like.", "Black Friday spending hit record highs this year but now experts are concerned that the import from America will have a negative impact on Christmas sales, leaving retailers struggling with excess stock.\n\nOnline spending grew by 12.5 per cent annually in November - the highest annual growth rate since Visa's UK Consumer Spending Index started in 2009.\n\nHowever, economists fear that the trend will quickly drop off as shoppers satisfy their Christmas wish-lists earlier than they traditionally would.\n\nStarting the season early: Black Friday spending hit record highs this year but now experts are concerned that the American export will have a negative impact Christmas sales\n\nCommenting on the shift in sales, Annabel Fiddes from IHS Markit, said: 'Whether this strong performance can be sustained into December and beyond is increasingly unclear.\n\n'Notably, consumer confidence has declined in each of the past two months, while forecasts of rising inflationary pressures and unemployment in the next year are all likely to weigh on expenditure growth going forward.'\n\nThe UK Consumer Spending Index, compiled by IHS Markit, uses spending on Visa cards, which accounts for \u00a31 in every \u00a33 of all UK spending, as a base.\n\nThe card figures are then adjusted so that the index reflects all consumer spending, not just that on cards.\n\nLooking at different types of spending, recreation and culture saw the strongest annual growth, with a 9.3 per cent year-on-year increase in spending on this sector.\n\nGoogle gifting: Online spending grew by 12.5 per cent annually in November - the highest annual growth rate since Visa's UK Consumer Spending Index started in 2009\n\nThere was also a sharp increase in spending on health and education, which saw a 5.7 per cent annual uplift.\n\nSpending on miscellaneous goods and services, which includes jewellery and hairdressing, increased by 4.9 per cent annually, while spending on clothing and footwear increased by 2 per cent year-on-year.\n\nSpending on food, beverages and tobacco increased by 0.7 per cent annually, while spending on household goods saw a 3.7 per cent upswing compared with a year earlier.\n\nHotels, restaurants and bars recorded a 2.2 per cent annual spending increase, while spending on transport and communication was up by 2.1 per cent over the same period.\n\nSilence at the shops: Britons continued to favour internet shopping in this year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday, although growth slowed down compared to last year\n\nConcerns have been raised in recent months about the extent to which households are going into debt to fund their spending.\n\nBank of England figures have shown that consumer credit was increasing at the fastest annual rate seen in 11 years in October.\n\nStepChange Debt Charity previously warned that in the run-up to Christmas, there was 'real risk' of more people struggling with high levels of persistent debt.\n\nAnother recent survey by the British Retail Consortium and KPMG signals bad news for high street retailers.\n\nBritons continued to favour internet shopping in this year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday, although growth slowed down compared to last year.\n\nOnline sales of non-food items rose by 10.9 per cent, down from 11.8 per cent in November last year. This is the third consecutive month of growth above 10 per cent.\n\nPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said November retail sales figures remained positive, but performance had slowed down and was not as strong as the previous month.\n\nEssentials: Barclaycard said that shoppers spent 1.6 per cent more at the supermarket\n\n'Black Friday deals will have lured would-be shoppers away from the high street in search of bargains online,' he said.\n\nThe number of purchases made online on the day of the US-imported event rose by 6.7 per cent, and spending on the day was expected to have topped \u00a32billion, according to separate recent figures.\n\nBut analysts had been expecting a 20 per cent rise in sales. The growth was also far below last year's rise of 31 per cent.\n\nBR's Dickinson added: 'Overall, consumer spending remains stable, although very much value-driven with a focus towards products on promotion as shoppers take advantage of the deals of the moment and retailers strive to offer the best choice and value to their customers.'\n\nSeparate figures from Barclaycard showed buoyancy when it came to consumer confidence. Just over half of Brits said they were confident in their household finances.\n\nBarclaycard said that spending on Black Friday day was up 2.3 per cent compared to last year.\n\nSpending on electricals, traditionally the must-purchase item, more than quadrupled the growth seen on an average Friday - though compared to Black Friday 2015, the figure contracted 1.1 per cent.\n\nShoppers spent 1.6 per cent more at the supermarket and 11.7 per cent more on petrol, boosting essential spending by the highest amount Barclaycard has recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, the 'experience economy' continued to grow strongly as consumers enjoyed leisure time, with entertainment spend up 11.9 per cent and travel increasing 6 per cent.\n\nPaul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard said : 'November was another strong month for consumer spending growth, the second-highest level we've seen this year.\n\n'Whilst some pockets of discretionary spending, such as that on entertainment, was up again by double-digits, most noticeable was the amount households are spending on day-to-day necessities, with supermarket shopping and petrol hitting an all-time high.'\n\nConcerns over the wider economic picture continue to dampen sentiment, with only a third (33 per cent) expressing confidence in the UK economy and 55 per cent in their household finances.\n\nThis continues the subdued levels seen in 2016, which are down on the average figures in 2015, when the proportion of those confident was 45 per cent and 71 per cent respectively.\n\nEDITOR'S DEALS OF THE WEEK Broadband Broadband 35Mbs speeds, \u00a350 Amazon voucher \u00a322 per month Current Account Current Account \u00a3185 M&S vouchers to switch and stay \u00a3100 fee-free overdraft Credit card Credit Card No fees to use abroad 0.5% cashback on spending Savings Account Savings Account Easy access savings account* 1.3% AER variable Make a will Make a will 50% off - \u00a345 legally binding will Use code: thisismoney45 * No FSCS protection, instead covered by French deposit guarantee scheme.

Electronics, watches and home goods are their most popular deals this year.\n\nPrice cuts of at least 50 per cent are being promoted on fashions, footwear and household electricals. Some are promising cuts of 75 per cent amid claims of products being sold at a loss just to get them off the shelves.\n\nOne woman appeared to be very happy with her deal on a new microwave at Currys PC World in Luton, Bedfordshire\n\nThese two people carried a new hi-fi system to their car after buying it on Black Friday today at Currys PC World in Luton\n\nFlatscreen televisions were proving to be popular at the Currys PC World in Luton today\n\nBut early online sales between midnight and 7am were down, with research finding that shoppers across the UK were not willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep to make the most of Black Friday discounts this year.\n\nPCA Predict analysts found online sales up to 7am today had fallen by a quarter (24 per cent) compared to 2016, with the highest number of online transactions before breakfast in South East London.\n\nPolice issue Black Friday fraud alert\n\nPolice have warned consumers to be on guard for cyber fraud on the biggest shopping day of the year.\n\nThe public have been urged to 'slow down' and 'think' about the gifts they are buying and who they are purchasing them from.\n\nVictims reported losing nearly \u00a316 million to Christmas shopping fraudsters last year, increasing from \u00a310 million lost the year before.\n\nTrending items they reported losing out on included Yeezy trainers, Kylie Jenner make-up, hair dryers, drones and Fitbit watches.\n\nMobile phones continue to be the most likely thing that people try to buy from fraudsters, with accessories and clothing second and footwear third.\n\nCity of London Police Commander Dave Clark said: 'Christmas is a busy time of year when we are required to make several quick decisions, especially when it comes to present buying.\n\n'Our fraud awareness campaign is highlighting that it is very much 'the thought that counts' especially when it comes to avoiding fraudsters.\n\n'Fraudsters see the Christmas rush as an ideal opportunity to take advantage of people's generosity without a single care about the consequences this may cause for the victim.'\n\nChris Boaz, \u200eHead of Marketing of PCA Predict, said: 'As of this morning, online sales are actually down, compared to last year.\n\n'However, last night there was a huge surge in sales as people tried to beat the morning rush to snap up the best deals. By contrast last year, many consumers shopped from midnight to 7am to bag a bargain.'\n\n'One of the primary reasons for this is due to the extended sales in the run up to Black Friday itself, which showed an increase of 11 per cent meaning consumers aren't as pressed as they once were to shop on the day.'\n\nHowever by lunchtime, PCA Predict found there was a growth of 7 per cent in online sales between 7am and 11am - giving a total fall in sales of only 2 per cent between midnight and 11am.\n\nThe peak time for purchasing in Britain so far today has been 10.58am.\n\nSpending is expected to be up 7 per cent on last year to reach \u00a37.8billion over the four day sales weekend, according to the Centre for Retail Research and VoucherCodes website.\n\nA record number of stores are running deals for fear of losing business to rivals, particularly the online goliath Amazon.\n\nSeveral retailers' websites have been experiencing so much traffic in the past 24 hours that they crashed - with companies including Game, Ted Baker, Next and Calvin Klein all affected, according to analysts.\n\nSimon Wharton, managing director at e-commerce agency PushON, said: 'Last night, before Black Friday even got underway, a number of e-commerce sites had already gone down as they couldn't cope with traffic surges.\n\n'Not long after 9pm, Ted Baker was struggling to meet demand with users temporarily unable to access the site. GAME was also down for about three hours yesterday as the retailer 'updated' its site for Black Friday.\n\n'And Calvin Klein had opted to pay for adverts on Google, yet when users clicked on the ads, they were led to a blank page. This morning, Next was also experiencing issues with its website.'\n\nShoppers were seen pouring into stores including a Tesco Extra in Manchester and a Game at Westfield Stratford in London overnight, but most other outlets were sparsely populated this morning.\n\nWestfield Stratford in East London was looking busy by lunchtime today as people took their time on Black Friday today\n\nBargain hunters gather at Westfield Stratford in East London today to seek out the best deals around lunchtime today\n\nThousands of shoppers tried for a Black Friday deal today, with a main road in Edinburgh pictured this afternoon\n\nGordon McKinnon, operations director at shopping centre owner Intu, said: 'Because it doesn't immediately follow a big public holiday like Thanksgiving, Black Friday has a completely different shape over here than it does in in the US.\n\n'It has evolved in the UK from a one day event to be a longer affair, as retailers stretch out the sales period to help spread activity over a longer time frame. So, Black Friday has a more relaxed feel in the UK, as shoppers visit stores at their leisure before numbers pick up later in the day and reach a peak this evening.\n\nHe added: 'If previous years' patterns are anything to go by, we're expecting the day to get busier and hit a peak this evening when those finishing work will join the hunt for deals. By the end of the today, we should have seen well above one million shoppers through our doors.\n\nMany retailers have been offering bargains ahead of Black Friday and the cuts were stepped up overnight. As a result, millions of people were shopping through the night from their beds on phones and laptops.\n\nBut some analysts and industry leaders warn that, in some cases, the price cuts amount to a disastrous exercise in self-harm.\n\nApart from potentially selling items at a loss, there is a huge cost around delivering items bought online and then handling returns. Evidence of the difficulties emerged yesterday with news that two chains, the furniture retailer Multiyork, and the shoe business Shoon, are in trouble.\n\nA handful of keen bargain hunters try their luck as Tesco at Kingston Park in Newcastle-upon-Tyne opens its doors at 5am\n\nBlack Friday on Oxford Street at 8am today, with very few shoppers on what is expected to be the year's biggest shopping day\n\nPeople exit Oxford Circus London Underground station today, with the area much quieter than retailers would have hoped\n\nMultiyork, which has 50 shops and a factory, has gone into administration and Shoon, which has six shops and concessions in department stores, has filed notice of its intention to appoint administrators although it may be sold.\n\nThe Christmas period is make or break for most retailers and the Black Friday sales, which have been imported from America, have turned traditional shopping patterns on their head.\n\nThe relatively warm autumn means fashion retailers are looking to offload masses of unsold coats, boots and woollens.\n\nIndustry data has shown a slump in sales of furniture and household electricals, everything from washing machines to TVs, where there will be particularly big reductions.\n\nJames Brown of pricing and promotions experts, Simon-Kucher, warned: 'Black Friday is now a real retail experience and shoppers love getting out to find a bargain.\n\n'But for some businesses they will slash prices so much that they accidentally turn the day into their most disastrous day of the year.\n\n'We've reviewed thousands of promotions by hundreds of businesses, and we're confident that many businesses will make dramatically less than they expect out of cutting prices on Black Friday.\n\n'Some will even make a loss, although many won't actually realise it as the sales numbers look good at first glance. One business we examined recently had the unwelcome realisation that roughly half of all their promotions were loss making.'\n\nShoppers rush into a Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester, moments after security guards open the doors at 5am today\n\nTwo shoppers carry a Toshiba TV together at the Tesco store in Gorton, Manchester, this morning as Black Friday begins\n\nA police officer monitors shoppers at the Tesco in Gorton (left) as one man carries a TV at a Tesco in Stockport (right)\n\nShoppers wait outside Game at Westfield Stratford in East London after the video game retailer opened its doors at midnight\n\nBargain hunters stayed up late to make it to the midnight opening of Game in Stratford. Shoppers will spend nearly \u00a38billion this weekend\n\nShoppers queue up outside an H&M store on Oxford Street in London's West End on Black Friday at 6am this morning\n\nRespected retail analyst, Richard Hyman, described Black Friday as 'crazy' in terms of damaging store profits. 'Much of the trade would love to opt out but in this weakest of all retail markets, few have succeeded,' he said.\n\n'With demand thin and consumer confidence brittle, Black Friday will essentially suck Christmas sales forward. For Amazon it's a stick with which to beat much of the industry.'\n\nThe boss of the Fat Face clothing chain, Anthony Thompson, who refuses to take part in Black Friday, described the sales as 'ludicrous'.\n\nHe said: 'If you're a clothing brand or gifting retailer, you don't want to discount at the wrong time. It's ludicrous to suggest it's a good idea in clothing.\n\n'UK clothing is on its knees and it's killing itself. We're weakening our proposition and encouraging people to buy on price.'\n\nSome estimates suggest the Black Friday weekend will hoover up 40 per cent of all spending on Christmas. Amazon was at the forefront of bringing the American sale event to the UK in 2010.\n\nIn the US, Black Friday comes on the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Asda, which is owned by Wal-mart of the USA, initially pushed the event.\n\nWorkers try to keep up with demand at the Amazon fulfilment centre near Doncaster in South Yorkshire today\n\nAmazon said in the first six hours of Black Friday it had sold more than 63,000 toys and 32,000 beauty products\n\nSome of Amazon's best-selling items included the Nintendo Switch, a Bosch cordless drill and a Lego Ninjago Movie toy\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\n'Get clean and sober' Sharon Osbourne on Meghan Markle's father\n\nWatch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nBritish diver involved in Thai soccer team rescue feared the worst\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nBeaming Prince Harry and Meghan open Nelson Mandela exhibition\n\nWatch video\n\n'My view has not changed' FBI Director Chris Wray on Russia\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave lion cub forced to jump into raging river to follow mother\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nLabradoodle is a scardy cat when it comes to escalators\n\nBritons prepare to spend a record \u00a37.78bn over Black Friday weekend - with in store sales still set to beat online giants Sale type Black Friday Sat/Sun Cyber Monday 2017 total 2016 total YoY % Difference UK online \u00a31.15bn \u00a30.71bn \u00a31.27bn \u00a33.13bn \u00a32.79bn 12% UK offline \u00a31.45bn \u00a31.87bn \u00a31.33bn \u00a34.65bn \u00a34.49bn 4% Total \u00a32.59bn \u00a32.58bn \u00a32.60bn \u00a37.78bn \u00a37.28bn 7% Source: VoucherCodes\n\nHowever it scaled back involvement after ugly scenes at stores as people pushed and fought over cheap TVs.\n\nMore recently, retailers like Argos, which launched deeper Black Friday cuts at 9pm last night, John Lewis and the other major department stores have championed the event. And now, virtually all the chains and independents are offering deals.\n\nResearch by accountants PwC suggest half of adults will buy something in the sales with the average spend up from \u00a3170 last year to \u00a3200.\n\nConsumer Markets leader at PwC, Lisa Hooker, said: 'Technology and electrical items are in demand this Black Friday weekend. Retailers who specialise in these areas can't afford not to have a Black Friday promotion in the UK - it's here to stay.\n\n'UK shoppers are increasingly willing to part with their money on Black Friday and we expect the fastest spending growth to come from younger shoppers, who are more likely to purchase on impulse.'\n\nExperts warned the sales were not good for stores. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said Black Friday doesn't increase sales, it simply means spending happens earlier, adding: 'It forces retailers to sell their goods at discounted prices earlier and for longer.\n\n'Shoppers have become accustomed to reduced price tags, with retailers all too happy to accommodate their demands for fear of being overlooked. Clearly this is not sustainable.'\n\nHe added that retailers faced huge costs in dealing with deliveries and returns.\n\nThe fact that Next is running deals of up to 70 per cent off for the first time is also seen by some as a sign of how shops feel they have no choice but to offer discounts.\n\nDouglas Ker, of the handbag firm Meli Melo, said: 'Brands feel forced to participate in this sales bonanza. Discounting across the industry has gone wild.'\n\nHOW TO SECURE YOUR PERFECT BLACK FRIDAY DEAL\n\nConsumers will spend seven per cent more this year over Black Friday compared with 2016 according to new research from VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) with more than \u00a37.8 billion worth of goods set to be sold.\n\nHowever, savvy shoppers looking for electronics might want to save their cash until Cyber Monday - which will see sales of around \u00a32.6 billion.\n\nDuring 2016 shoppers saved on average \u00a3121 by waiting until the last minute before committing their cash.\n\nExperts believe high streets and shopping centres will see five per cent more sales than online as retailers slash costs of electronic goods, fashion items and beauty products.\n\nPaul Lewis, Senior Director of Marketing at Voucher Codes said: 'Last year, we saw a 78 per cent increase in the number of visitors to the VoucherCodes website compared to the week prior, showing there's a massive appetite for offers and discount codes over the Black Friday weekend.\n\n'Cyber Monday is often the last day to take advantage of these fantastic offers, so we're not surprised that savvy shoppers are holding out a little longer for the maximum possible discount. This year we'll be helping our customers save even more, by adding a record-breaking number of offers and discount codes to our site; helping people to save money on treating themselves, as well as on gifts for friends and family.'\n\nIn previous years, some shoppers came to blows, such as these in Wembley, north west London as they attempted to by cheap televisons\n\nConsumers need to prepare a plan to secure the best deal and decide whether to try online or in store\n\nAccording to Anita Naik, Lifestyle Editor at VoucherCodes, consumers should develop a strategy to secure the best deals.\n\nShe said: 'Black Friday is now one of the biggest shopping days of the year in Britain, which means if you're planning to jump in and do some Christmas shopping you can expect crowds on the high street and busy retail websites. There are ways to get the most out of the day without having to fight it out with fellow shoppers and my number one rule is to be prepared. This means know what you want, know where to get it from and know how to grab it before everyone else.'\n\nMs Naik said looking on a website such as VoucherCodes can cut down on the work.\n\nShe said: 'Set a budget and write a list. The key thing is to know what you want to buy and, most importantly, how much it usually costs.\n\n'It's easy to get drawn in by the discounts on the day, so knowing how much the things you want cost pre-Black Friday is key. If you're the type of person who gets easily swayed into buying things on impulse, make sure you review your available Black Friday budget ahead of the day and stick to it like glue. It may sound boring, but bargains are only bargains if you need them!'\n\nMs Naik said some of the deals go live shortly after midnight, so it might be worth setting an alarm. Also there are online lightening deals.\n\nDespite the threat of chaotic scenes, most sales will be made in store according to experts at the Voucher Code website\n\nGet a REAL deal this Black Friday: About to splash out? Don't buy a thing until you've read our guide to the jewellery gems, tech treasures and fabulous fashion on sale\n\nThe biggest shopping day of the year -- Black Friday -- is finally upon us. Usually lasting over the weekend, it sees the High Street slash prices on thousands of goods, often by hundreds of pounds.\n\nAn American import (Black Friday falls the day after their Thanksgiving holiday and marks the start of the Christmas shopping season), it was adopted by the UK seven years ago -- and gets bigger every year.\n\nThis year, there are 24 million of us gearing up for the bargains and data suggests that the average Black Friday shopper in the UK will splash out \u00a3246, meaning that figures look set to rise by almost 10 per cent from last year.\n\nBut the experts at consumer watchdog Which? warn that it's worth checking just how good the deals really are.\n\nA year-long investigation, which the Mail highlighted at the beginning of the week, showed an astonishing six out of ten of last year's 'deals' were for products that were, in fact, cheaper or the same price at other times of the year.\n\nBut there are bargains out there.

Money, says: 'We did a recent investigation which showed how easy it is for fraudsters to send texts that pretend to be from shops offering bargains. Consumers must be extra vigilant this Black Friday and think twice before clicking on the link in any unsolicited messages.'\n\n1. Don't give any website your credit card PIN for any reason and try to buy only from those you know and trust.\n\n2. Don't rush into a decision. If you feel pressurised by a website -- many retailers use tools such as a ticking clock or a 'just one left' banner to make you feel that you need to act swiftly -- then you should take a step back.\n\n3. Do their contact numbers look bona fide? If they have a PO box number rather than a proper address, or they only offer a mobile number or premium-rate '09' phone line, they may be fine -- but if alarm bells ring, don't proceed. If you don't know a brand, be especially cautious.\n\n4. Don't necessarily trust social media -- if it sounds too good to be true on Twitter or WhatsApp, then it probably is!\n\n5. If you do fall foul and are affected by a data breach, change any passwords linked to the account or website in question.

Smaller hardware firms lack the market share to significantly affect Google's business, the person said.\n\nGoogle also can continue to pay hardware makers to be the exclusive search provider, the business from which it derives most of its revenue, on a device-by-device basis. The EU did not specify any limits on Google's ability to outbid smaller players in search such as DuckDuckGo.\n\nGoogle is \"systematically set to continue to dominate the industry,\" said Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft's mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital.\n\nThe ruling should give smartphone makers the ability to develop phones based on Fire OS, a version of Android customised and distributed by Amazon, the EU press statements said.\n\nGoogle has allowed third parties to make such \"forks\" of Android, as they are termed in the industry, but it limited their adoption through licensing restrictions, the EU found.\n\nThe issue remains, though, that the EU did not specify that Google must provide its apps to smartphones with \"forks\", meaning that Fire OS phones could continue to lack services such as Google Maps, industry analysts said.\n\nThe omission leaves the industry with an \"observation\" rather than offering a \"prescription\" that puts the forks on equal footing, said Kumar Shah, managing director at investment firm Transit Capital and a former leader at Indian smartphone maker Micromax.\n\nInstead, the EU said Google could maintain \"fair and objective\" restrictions on devices to which it does supply apps.\n\nSmartphone vendors who try to adopt forks may also not be welcome by wireless carriers, who are focused on the rollout of high-speed 5G networks and do not want \"handset makers distracted by side issues,\" Fogg said.\n\nGoogle must stop the illegal practices within 90 days to avoid fines, or it can seek a delay of the order while it appeals. Google has not said how it would adjust practices if it loses the appeal nor whether it would make changes in the EU only or globally.", "Loon, the internet-delivering-balloon unit of Google-parent Alphabet, is announcing its first commercial deal.\n\nThe company says it will work with partner Telkom Kenya to deliver 4G/LTE cellular access to Kenya in 2019.\n\nThe announcement comes just a week after Loon graduated from Alphabet's secretive \"moonshot factory\" known as X.

With a click, the app identifies tracks playing on the radio, at parties or as background music.\n\nBut Shazam has struggled to find a way to make money off its technology, even as it said that it had reached one billion downloads on smartphones last year.\n\nShazam only recently announced it had become profitable, thanks to advertising and steering traffic to other sites such as Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThe technology is also no longer quite as novel, with Shazam facing rivals such as SoundHound and with smartphones capable of ever more advanced recognition functions.", "Samsung is working on an Android Go edition phone to launch in India (and other markets) very soon. Until now, rumours were that the Samsung Android Go device will be the Galaxy J2. But now, the Bluetooth certification site reveals that the phone will actually be called Galaxy J2 Core and not Galaxy J2. With the Galaxy J2 Core, Samsung will most likely aim to compete with other existing Android Go phones in the Indian market, like the Nokia 1.\n\nAs also rumoured earlier, Samsung's Android Go edition phone will come in as many as seven variants. The Bluetooth certification site also reveals the same. According to the Bluetooth certification listing, the Samsung Android Go phone or Galaxy J2 Core will come with SM-J260F, SM-J260M, SM-J260Y, SM-J260F_DS, SM-J260G_DS, SM-J260M_DS, and SM-J260Y_DS model numbers. The specs and prices of all the seven variants will vary from each other. The certification site didn't reveal any specification details about the Android Go phone from Samsung.\n\nThe launch timeline of the Samsung's Android Go edition phone aka Galaxy J2 Core is yet to be officially revealed by the company. Some reports suggest that Samsung may announce its Android Go edition phone later this year, while some say it may get postponed to next year.\n\nSamsung is expected to launch the Galaxy J2 Core in other markets apart from its home. The key markets for the Galaxy J2 Core are likely to be India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Alongside these markets, the Android Go smartphone is likely to debut in the UK, Uzbekistan, Germany, Italy, Russia, and France among others markets.\n\nThe Android Go phone was spotted on the Geekbench benchmarking site a couple of weeks ago. The benchmark listing revealed almost the complete specs of the phone. The listing reveals that the Galaxy J2 Core will come with a 5-inch Super AMOLED display. The phone will be powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos 7570 SoC paired with 1GB RAM and 16GB storage. On the camera front, the Galaxy J2 Core will come with a single camera setup on both back and front panel.\n\nALSO READ: This is Samsung Android Go phone, will not run stock Android\n\nOn the rear panel, the phone will consist of an 8-megapixel sensor, while on the front the Galaxy J2 Core will sport a 5-megapixel sensor for selfies. The phone will be backed by a 2600mAh battery. On the software front, the Galaxy J2 Core will run Android 8.1 Oreo (Go edition) with Samsung Experience UX on top, meaning, no stock Android for the Samsung Android Go phone. Running on Android Go software means the phone will come preloaded with slimmed down apps like Google Go, Maps Go, and YouTube Go.", "The Play Store created some controversy last month after announcing plans to remove apps that used Accessibility Services for any purpose that didn't directly relate to disabled users. While Google is reconsidering the best implementation for the Accessibility Services policy, a separate announcement introduces additional policies intended to help make apps distributed through the Play Store more secure and possibly improve performance. Over the next two years, developers will be required to target a recent SDK version in their app updates and provide 64-bit versions of native apps if they aren't already. The Play Store will also begin adding some new metadata to APKs for verification purposes, but most developers shouldn't need to worry about this.\n\nStarting in late-2018, all new and updated apps will be required to target an SDK that is no more than 1 year older than the current codename release.\n\nFor example, following the release of Android P, developers will only be able to publish apps targeting Android 8.0 Oreo (API 26) or above. With the release of Android Q in the following year, the new minimum target API level will become P (likely API 28), and so on. The phrasing of the policy appears to center on the major codename releases, which means mid-term updates like 8.1 (API 27) will probably not factor in.\n\nAs a reminder, target API level is different from minimum API level. As the name implies, minimum API level is used to declare the lowest version of Android an app supports. The target API level is technically defined as the version of the operating system an app was tested to work with; but in more practical terms, it's used to define a set of behaviors an app expects from the operating system. For example, an app can target API 26 (Android 8.1) while having a minimum API of 14 (Android 4.0). The reason this exists is to tell future versions of Android that certain assumptions were made in the development of an app so the OS can make the proper allowances. See Ian Lake's post for a more in-depth explanation.\n\nThis policy is meant to push apps into using recent versions of the SDK that include higher-performance code and rely on fewer exceptions to maintain backwards compatibility - e.g. Apps targeting Android 5.0 so they don't have to implement runtime permissions. It will also encourage developers to support many of the power-saving and security features added along the way.\n\nThe target API level requirement will go into effect for new apps in August 2018. Enforcement for updates to existing apps will not go into effect until November 2018.\n\nBuried in the text of Google's blog post was a throw-away statement that future versions of Android will also enforce API level restrictions. It's technically not specific as to whether older apps will only lose certain functions or if they will be blocked entirely. There are also no details about how flexible the limits will be.\n\nFuture Android versions will also restrict apps that don't target a recent API level and adversely impact performance or security.\n\nThis makes some sense given that most apps built in the Android 1.x days are mostly inoperable on recent versions. Unfortunately, it may also mean some perfectly operational apps will be locked out. This will especially impact games since they are often left alone once the initial release and bug fixes are rolled out.\n\nThe other new requirement will be leveled at apps distributing native code. In preparation for hardware architectures that do not support 32-bit code, Google Play will begin requiring 64-bit support. Developers are free to either bundle 64-bit code alongside their 32-bit code in the same APK, or they can (and should) distribute a variant for each architecture using the Play Store's multiple APK system.\n\nEnforcement of the 64-bit requirement won't go into effect until August 2019. Google is scheduling a long lead-up to give developers plenty of time to plan for a transition.\n\nApps that aren't receiving updates will be left alone, at least for now. The new requirements only apply when updates are sent to the Play Store, so nothing will happen to existing APKs if a developer takes a very long time to release an update or abandons an app entirely.\n\nUnfortunately, the target SDK requirement may also discourage some developers from updating older apps if it becomes too much work to support API changes with each passing year.\n\nGoogle's announcement included one last detail about a new practice going into effect in early 2018. The Play Store will begin inserting \"a small amount of security metadata\" into APKs.

She ended up making it to a hotel in Istanbul, Turkey before drawing herself a bath, safely delivering her own child in the tub, and falling asleep.\n\nSurprise! Tia Freeman, 22, gave birth by herself in a hotel room in Turkey\n\nFam photo: She thanked the crew at Turkish Airlines who helped her out the next day\n\nTia's story first made national news in Turkey, and has now gone viral in the US thanks to an animated Twitter thread -- but the young mom insists she still doesn't get why her tale is such a big deal.\n\n'I still really don't understand what's so shocking about my delivery story. Lol maybe it'll set in one day,' she began the thread, which makes it immediately clear to everyone else just what is so shocking.\n\nTia was already into her third trimester when she found out she was pregnant. She was taking birth control, but says the one she was on didn't require her to menstruate every month.\n\n(Later, she identified it as Microgestin Fe, which actually shouldn't have stopped her from menstruating unless she chose to skip the placebo week at the end of the pack.)\n\n'Not having a period wasn't an indicator for me,' she explained. 'On top of that I didn't really gain any weight.'\n\nThe tale... The first-time mom has made international headlines with her incredible birth story, which she shared on Twitter this week\n\nNo way... Tia didn't know she was pregnant until her third trimester, and was in denial for a while after\n\nWhen she did find out she was pregnant, she spent the next month 'in denial,' insisting to herself that there was 'no way' she was carrying a baby. She was working away from home, and decided not to tell anyone about it, either.\n\n'My dumba** was like, maybe it'll just go away...' she wrote.\n\nToward the end of her pregnancy, she had plans for a trip to Germany, and 'ya girl was not about to waste international flight money' -- so she hopped on a plane before her due date and headed away for her vacation.\n\n'So everything is going well, no biggie, but dawg this is a 14hr flight & there was a complimentary meal, but everything had meat in it & you know I'm a vegetarian, so I was like, \"I can't eat this,' she recalled.\n\n'But 14 hrs was too long to wait so I decided to eat the salmon hoping I wouldn't get sick. Now I don't know if it was the salmon, the flight, or it was just my time, but out of nowhere I start cramping up.'\n\nShe assumed she had food poisoning from the salmon and decided to go to sleep for the last hour of the flight.\n\nCaution to the wind: She had plans to go on vacation to Germany, and decided to go ahead with them\n\nSomething's fishy... She started to feel sick on the plane but was convinced it was because of the salmon she ate\n\nBuilding up: When she landed in Istanbul, where she had a 17-hour layover, she was feeling much worse\n\nWhen she landed in Turkey for her 17-hour layover, though, her cramps had worsened. She just wanted to make it to the hotel she'd booked for the night, but customs was taking a long time and she was feeling terrible.\n\n'I'm literally gripping the railing trying to make it through the lines. At this point I feel like I'm about to pass out. I'm sweating. I feel like I have to vomit. I'm going through it. Then I'm like, \"Wait a minute, b****, are you in labor?!\"\n\nAfter the thought hit her, she decided to Google it. But still unsure if it was real labor or she was having Braxton Hicks contractions, she painfully made her way to the hotel.\n\n'Either way it goes I'm not giving birth in this airport, so I start gassing myself up because I am NOT having a baby in this airport,' she said. 'I make it to my hotel & now I'm sure I'm in labor. There is no way in the world I'm not in labor because I can barely stand up at this point.\n\n'So I'm in a foreign country, where no one speaks English, I don't know this country's emergency number, & I have no clue what to do.\n\nScary... She realized she was in labor but didn't want to give birth in the airport, so gave herself pep talks until she made it to her pre-arranged hotel\n\nDIY: Because of the language barrier and her fear of asking for help, she decided to deliver her own baby -- turning to YouTube for instructions\n\nWow: She described the intense pain as she delivered her son in the bath tub of the hotel room\n\n'So in true millennial form, I decided to Youtube it. If no one else had my back, the internet would! So here my a** is in my hotel room, all by my lonesome learning, how to deliver my own baby.'\n\nTia filled up the bath tub for a water birth, grabbed a towel to bite down on while fighting the pain, and found another towel to wrap the baby in.\n\n'It's weird how focused a person becomes when they're adrenaline starts going. Because at no point ever did I freak out. Like, I just did what I had to do,' she said.\n\nShe followed the instructions she found online, which said to start to push when the contractions were two minutes apart. By the time she was in the tub, they were just a minute apart, meaning her baby was moments away from making his entrance into the world.\n\n'I have NEVVVVEEERRRR felt any pain like this in my life. I felt like I was being split open. WHERE WAS MY EPIDURAL?!' she wrote.\n\n'Luckily it happened pretty quickly. I only had to push about 5-6 times before a baby popped out,' she went on. 'Now let me tell you, babies are buoyant. That little joker said bloop and floated right on up to the top of the water.'\n\nNext step: Luckily, the birth went quickly, and she knew from the internet to wait for the afterbirth\n\nSmart: She was nervous about cutting the cord, but sliced it with a knife and tied it off with her shoelaces, which she had sterilized in the room's kettle\n\nAfter noting that she'd had a boy, she knew she needed to wait until the placenta, attached to the umbilical cord, followed him out. She again followed along with what she read online, rubbing her lower abdomen to 'persuade my placenta to come on out' while holding her baby with the other hand.\n\nThe placenta came out, and she used knives to cut it.\n\n'You're supposed to measure off like 2 inches from the stomach and tie one lace and then tie the other inch another inch from there. Now you cut the cord in between,' she said.\n\n'Now, I haven't been nervous this whole time but cutting this cord is freaking me out ... like what if I hurt this man?! So I'm poking the cord with the knife to see if it affects him. Fortunately it doesn't (which the internet said it wouldn't) so I cut right into that thang! And it's tougher than it look.'\n\nUsing shoelaces, which she had sterilized in boiling water in the hotel room's electric kettle, she clamped the end of the cord.\n\nThough she was now exhausted, she needed to clean the bathroom 'because it looked like the set of a horror movie,' so she scrubbed everything down, breastfed her new baby, and went to sleep.\n\nExperts: The next day, she went back to the airport -- not for the next leg of her flight, but to ask officials there what to do next\n\nSafety: After police, customs, and a doctor determined she was not trafficking the baby and it was indeed hers, they sent her to the US Consulate\n\nOfficial: There, she got a birth certificate and passport for her baby\n\nStill, her story wasn't over. The next morning, she was meant to go to the airport to catch her connecting flight. Though she knew she wouldn't actually be flying on to Germany, she also had questions about leaving the country with her new baby -- and figured there was no better place to ask than the airport.\n\n'When I get there the airport workers are freaking out because you can tell this baby is fresh. I legit didn't have any baby clothes & made him something out of my favorite blue oversized button down,' she wrote. 'Anyway, they thought I was a human trafficker trying to smuggle out a baby.'\n\nAfter having a doctor and nurse check her out to determine that she had in fact just given birth, she also spoke with customs, the police, and higher-ups at the airline.\n\nDuring this time, someone tipped off the press, who turned up in full force to take her picture.\n\nAll good! Xavier Ata Freeman was later checked out at the hospital and found to be healthy\n\nCongrats! Tia spent two weeks in Turkey recovering before going home, with a free flight upgrade\n\nShock: Her family, who didn't know she was pregnant, learned she gave birth a few days after it happened\n\nTia then headed over to the US Consulate, who asked her a lot of questions and issued her a birth certificate and passport for her new little one. They also insisted on taking her and the baby to the hospital for a check-up, where they found out for sure that the baby was healthy.\n\nTia ended up staying in Turkey for two weeks to recover, during which time Turkish Airlines paid for her hotel. They also comped her meals and upgraded her and her friend -- whom she was supposed to meet in Germany -- to first class for their flight home.\n\n'Oh and no one knew I had a baby until days after I gave birth to him (not even my mom) so I sprang this story on everyone,' she concluded.\n\n'Here he is Xavier Ata Freeman born March 7, 2018 in Istanbul, Turkey!

But what is Recep Tayyip Erdogan's net worth?\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan\n\nBorn on February 26, 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan started out in humble beginnings as the son of a coastguard on Turkey's Black Sea coast.\n\nAt the age of 13, Erdogan moved to Istanbul with his four other siblings where he attended an Islamic school before getting a degree from Marmara University in Management.\n\nHe went on to play professional football and became renowned for his fame after playing for the Turkish football club Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, while also being a member of Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party and active in Islamic circles.\n\nErdogan ended his footballing career when he was elected as the Mayor of Istanbul, but after military officers made a power grab, the Welfare Party was banned.\n\nA year later in 1999, he was jailed for four months for publicly reading a nationalist poem that included the lines: 'The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.'\n\nIn 2001 with Abdullah Gul, Erdogan founded the Islamic-rooted AKP, the party that went on to win a solid majority in the parliamentary election and led to Recep being appointed as prime minister.\n\nMore than a decade later, a corruption scandal battered his government and although Erdogan blamed the Gulenists, three cabinet ministers' sons were arrested.\n\nEmployees of Zaman gather after it was seized in a crackdown against Gulen supporters\n\nAfter Erdogan became the President in 2014, he survived an attempted coup by factions within the military and went on to win the referendum on increased presidential powers.\n\nAt the time, Erdogan said that the plot was engineered by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who headed up a network of schools educating people about the Hizmet movement, which promotes altruism and modesty.\n\nSince then, Turkish courts have jailed dozens of officers for alleged coup plots after the failed attempt, which claimed at least 240 lives.\n\nAccording to officials, Erdogan's life was also put in danger while staying in Marmaris, but he was back in less than 12 hours with a TV appearance during which he declared himself a 'chief commander'.\n\nAlthough the Turkish President has resolved economic problems, he has also been considered to be an autocratic leader who is against anyone who opposes him.\n\nDespite denying that he wants to impose Islamic values and revealing that he is committed to secularism, his supporters still refer to him as 'Sultan', a reference to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nTurkey lifted the ban on women wearing headscarves in the country's state institutions in 2013 but bids to criminalise adultery and introduce alcohol-free zones failed.\n\nSupporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wave national flags as they wait for his arrival\n\nErdogan has also stated that 'no Muslim family' should consider birth control or family planning because of his aim to 'multiply our descendants'.\n\nThe AKP has also managed to keep inflation under control after the 1990s when it soared above 100 percent, but in 2014, the economy started to change and unemployment rose above 10 percent.\n\nErdogan wife\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran in July 4, 1978 and the couple have two sons, Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye.\n\n2018 Turkish elections\n\nErdogan declared victory in the Turkish presidential election in June 2018 amid speculation of 'manipulated' results and the President received the executive powers he has sought in order to tighten his grip on the nation.\n\nThe AKP will now rule over Turkey until 2023 after its victory in parliamentary and presidential polls, taking 42.5 percent while Erdogan garnered 52.5 percent of the vote. The opposition's candidate Muharrem Ince, took nearly 31 percent.\n\nPresident Erdogan will now form a government as well as appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats. He will also be able to issue decrees, prepare budgets and impose states of emergency.\n\nThe role of prime minister has now been scrapped and is thought to further dilute democracy in Turkey under Erdogan's one-man rule.\n\nErdogan net worth\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan's net worth has accumulated to approximately $58 million (\u00a344m) and is the richest Turkish politician according to Top Richest.\n\nErdogan was also listed as the 48th most powerful person on the 2018 Forbes list.\n\nHowever, this figure seems a little high for someone who just earns $58,000 (\u00a344,000) a year, as reported by German newspaper Bild.\n\nThe article then went on to cite data published by Turkish opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet which stated that all members of the Erdogan family appear to be in business.\n\nBild also revealed that Erdgogan's son Ahmet's net worth amounted to around $80 million (\u00a360m) and made claims that he may be supported by the Turkish government.\n\nErdogan's other son Bilal, who frequently garners media attention for alleged criminal activity, now lives in Italy after being embroiled in a political corruption scandal.\n\nThe Turkish President also has one of the most lavish official residences in the world, the Ak Saray, otherwise known as the White Palace, which has a whopping 1,100 rooms, 250 of which are for the sole use of the Erdogan family.\n\nThought to be 30 times the size of the White House and believed to be the largest palace built anywhere in the world for more than 100 years, a reported \u00a37 million was spent on carpets and another \u00a35 million on 400 10ft high double doors.\n\nThe silk wallpaper is thought to have cost \u00a32,000 a roll and one drinking glass in the household is worth \u00a3250.\n\nDue to the numerous spas, swimming pools, bathrooms and steam rooms, the heating bill is thought to run up to \u00a3500,000 every winter. The entire home is thought to have cost \u00a3500 million to construct.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS...

Samsung, a hugely popular maker of Android phones, could, for example, break off and take much of the Android system with it. Samsung had no immediate comment.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, said the ruling \"is a blow to innovative, open-source business models.\"\n\nThe main complainant against Google was FairSearch, a Brussels-based lobbying group that has been backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and Nokia. It called the ruling \"an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behavior.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.", "Google has announced a new update for referral traffic from Google Images, which will help website managers better track their visitor sources.\n\nAs explained by Google:\n\n\"For webmasters, it hasn't always been easy to understand the role Google Images plays in driving site traffic. To address this, we will roll out a new referrer URL specific to Google Images over the next few months. The referrer URL is part of the HTTP header, and indicates the last page the user was on and clicked to visit the destination webpage.\"\n\nGoogle says that hundreds of millions of people use Google Images every day to discover and explore web content, and this new measure will make it easier to more accurately track such referrals, helping to better optimize website content. Understanding which of your images are driving traffic - and why - could give you another way to boost your SEO process, and maximize traffic opportunities.\n\nImage SEO is often overlooked, or misunderstood, so it's good to see Google making an effort to provide more transparency, and clarity, on the process.\n\nThe new referrer URL will have the same country level domain as the URL used for searching on Google Images. Most visitors, regardless of region, will come from images.google.com, but some will still come via a country-specific service, such as google.co.uk for the UK. In those cases, the referrer will uses that country's TLD - so you'd see 'images.google.co.uk' as the referrer, as opposed to the generic site.\n\nIt may not be a game-changer, but you might also be surprised to find out just how much traffic Google Images is providing your site.\n\nThe new changes will go into effect this week.", "DMV says tech giant recently expanded its autonomous car fleet to 55 vehicles\n\nApple is still extremely secretive about its self driving car plans - but new figures from the DMV have revealed just how advanced they are.\n\nThe new figures, obtained by MacReports, show Apple has 55 vehicles and 83 drivers under its permit to test autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis makes is the second highest permit holder, with more cars on the road that Waymo and Tesla, with only GM having more with 104.\n\nThe new figures, obtained by MacReports, show Apple has 55 vehicles and 83 drivers under its permit to test autonomous vehicles.

People can better utilise the commute time and turn their autonomous car into a virtual conference room\n\nApple says: 'Two or more people may hold a meeting as avatars around a table in a virtual environment, for example in a virtual room or on the bed of a flatbed truck'. This is one of the benefits of combining VR with autonomous vehicles\n\n'Two or more people may hold a meeting as avatars around a table in a virtual environment, for example in a virtual room or on the bed of a flatbed truck,' according to the patent.\n\nSubstituting windows for screens will also save money and improve safety as the glass segments compromise structural integrity in current vehicles.\n\nVirtual images could be synchronised with the movement of the car.\n\nThe patent suggests an 'active seat' that uses motion sensors to detect and then incorporate the physical effects of driving into virtual environments.\n\nFiled in September 2017 and published last week, the patent also states that there could be some AR (augmented reality) involvement", "Apple may have released the HomePod just a few months ago, but rumors are already circulating about what's in store next for the smart speaker.\n\nThe latest is that the iPhone maker could be preparing to release a cheaper version of the $350 HomePod, according to Chinese site Sina.\n\nThe device would be priced at a significant discount of up to $200, and would be available through Apple's Beats audio brand.\n\nApple might be releasing a cheaper, smaller version of its HomePod speaker. The device could be up to $200 cheaper than the $349 HomePod\n\nThe report from Sina doesn't mention when a cheaper HomePod would go on sale, but noted that Apple is discussing the plans with one of its suppliers, a Taiwanese chip manufacturer called MediaTek.\n\nRecently, it's been unclear what Apple plans to do with its ownership of Beats, especially now that it has released it's own smart speaker.\n\nBut releasing a cheaper HomePod under the Beats name would give Apple more choices when it comes to design, such as new colors and textures, CNET noted.\n\nIt's also not the first report to suggest that a cheaper HomePod may be in the works.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported that Apple may be prepping a more affordable smart speaker as a way to compete with Google and Amazon, which both released 'discount' versions of their own smart speakers, making the technology more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe cheaper HomePod would cost somewhere between $150 and $200, would be smaller and could be available as soon as this fall.\n\nThe wireless seven-inch HomePod currently availalble uses spatial awareness technology to sense its place in a room and adjust audio output accordingly. It has an Apple-designed upward-facing woofer paired with the custom A8 chip and is made of seamless mesh fabric\n\nApple is reportedly also releasing cheaper versions of the iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air.\n\nThe as of yet unverified release would not mark the first time Apple chose to produce a cheaper product that is more within reach.\n\nThe company answered the problem of high-dollar products by releasing the iPhone 5c and 5S at the same time, the 5c being less equipped but $100 cheaper than the 5S, in 2013.\n\nAdditionally, the company produces the iPhone SE and sells it for $350, the most affordable iPhone price today.\n\nThe cheaper HomePod might make consumers who are not willing to pay $349 more interested in Apple's reply to Google Home and Amazon's Echo.\n\nBoth Amazon and Google have released cheaper, smaller versions of their own smart speakers.\n\nThe smaller version of Google Home, the Home Mini, is $50, and that of Amazon's Echo, called the Echo Dot, is the same price.\n\nThe speaker is designed to primarily work with Apple Music and users can ask HomePod directly to play music from their Apple Music library\n\nHOW CAN YOU REMOVE THE WHITE RING LEFT BY APPLE'S HOMEPOD?\n\nApple has confirmed that its recently released smart speaker can damage wood furniture, by leaving behind a nasty white ring on the surface.\n\nThe iPhone maker has since updated its HomePod support page to reflect the issue.\n\nApple says that the mark may be caused by oils diffusing between the device's silicone base and the table surface.\n\nApple has said the HomePod should only leave behind a mark if the surface is treated with oil. To remove the white ring, users can wipe down the surface with a soft damp or dry rag\n\nThe company set out a few different steps to remove the white ring:\n\nThe mark should go away on its own after the HomePod is movedWiping the surface with a soft damp or dry cloth should remove the marksIf not, Apple says the user should re-oil the wooden surface Users should also move their HomePod to a non-wooden surface or table to prevent damage\n\nApple's $349 HomePod went on sale in February in the US, UK and Australia - two months later than initially planned.\n\nFirmly marketed at music lovers, the wireless seven-inch smart speaker uses spatial awareness technology to sense its place in a room and adjust audio output accordingly.\n\nFirst unveiled last year, the device houses Apple's virtual assistant Siri, meaning it can be controlled using voice commands and provide news and weather information when asked.\n\nIt is fitted with six microphones to record owners' voice commands.\n\nThe device joins the battle between Google and Amazon for the lucrative smart speaker market after its November release date was pushed back twice while Apple claimed it needed 'a little more time before it's ready'.\n\nThe speaker is designed to work with Apple Music and users can ask HomePod directly to play music from the Apple Music library. Users can use AirPlay to play songs on their Pod through other music providers via their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch\n\nThe HomePod is more than twice the price of the $180 Google Home and costs more than three times the $125 Amazon Echo.\n\nDuring the HomePod's launch last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook took to the stage at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose to unveil the speaker, which he claimed would 'reinvent home audio'.\n\n'We want to reinvent music in the home in the way we invented mobile music,' Cook said.\n\n'We really think it's going to take your home music experience to the next level.'\n\n'It brings advanced audio technologies like beam-forming tweeters, a high-excursion woofer and automatic spatial awareness, together with the entire Apple Music catalogue and the latest Siri intelligence, in a simple, beautiful design that is so much fun to use,' he said.\n\nHomePod is compatible with iPhone 5S or later, iPad Pro, iPad Air or later, iPad mini 2 or later, or iPod touch (6th generation) with iOS 11.2.5 or later.", "Speculated Siri's functions on recently released HomePod will greatly improve\n\nThough not one to give much away, Apple's voice assistant Siri has hinted she may be undergoing a major upgrade ahead of the technology company's annual developer conference.\n\nAustralian site the Apple Post noted that if a user asks Siri about WWDC, she won't provide any useful information but will instead drop cryptic hints.\n\nWhen users ask 'Hey Siri.

On June 4, Apple will also unveil newer versions of watchOS, tvOS and macOS 10.14.\n\nAs Siri will most likely gains new abilities, it's possible that Siri's capabilities on HomePod will evolve from the limited usage available now.\n\nIn April, Apple hired John Giannanadrea from Google. He is well-known for his expertise in AI and search and it's likely he'll be helping to improve Siri.\n\nIt is also rumored that Apple may be releasing a cheaper version of its $350 HomePod, even though the speaker came out just a few months ago.\n\nSiri also said when asked about WWDC: 'I'm gonna have a shiny new home! Well, not really shiny, more meshy and matte...'\n\nThe personal assistant was first introduced in October 2011 as a feature of the iPhone 4S.\n\nWhen users ask 'Hey Siri.

Seems I hit a nerve comparing you to Terry Wogan for broadcasting talent - but people would have paid to listen to him, whereas I guess most read this for amusement, and largely as it's free. Bitofcommon, United Kingdom.\n\nMate, you couldn't hit a nerve if NASA designed you a bespoke nerve-hitting system and sent you on a five-year training course explaining the nerve identification process. The reason you got a mention in last week's five points column - a mention, not a headline, don't flatter yourself - is because you called him Terry Wigan. He was one of the most famous celebrities in British public life over more than three decades, so a bit of fun was always going to be had there. If you need a safety net on such basic stuff, no squadron of interns, or even spell check, is going help you - particularly as Wogan gets underlined in red on my Word programme, and Wigan doesn't. Anyway, as regulars on here know, I don't work with a 'legion' of interns, or people preparing this column, or any of my material. I don't even work with one. I don't have fact checkers - beyond the usual sub-editors common to every newspaper - I don't have researchers. If I make a mistake, it's me; if there is a detailed statistical analysis, it's me. And if it's freaky Zambian psych-rock you're after - and I know it isn't, but as I explained last week I really don't care - well, that's going to be me, too. Five points, and we hope some brighter sparks, up next.\n\nPoint one: great managers... and Steven Gerrard.\n\nSteven Gerrard is just another attention seeker. How many top footballers make the best managers? I cannot think of any. Babylon 6, London.\n\nWell, you need to think a little harder then. This season's title winner is Pep Guardiola of Barcelona, who won six league titles and the European Cup and European Cup-Winners Cup' at Nou Camp, made 47 appearances for Spain and was named in the team of the tournament at the 2000 European Championship. He succeeds Antonio Conte, five Serie A titles, the Champions League and UEFA Cup with Juventus, and capped 20 times by Italy. Going for an unprecedented third consecutive Champions League win with Real Madrid is Zinedine Zidane - I mean, do you really want me to carry on doing this? Even a guy like Mauricio Pochettino, while not a success on the level of the names previously mentioned, played 20 times for Argentina, won two titles there, and the Copa del Rey twice with Espanyol. It is a myth that the best managers come from nowhere. Sir Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Bill Shankly, for instance, were all fine players and international footballers, too.\n\nGerrard would get first choice on any Liverpool youth players who are to be loaned out, and a number of them could easily play in the Rangers team next season. Curtis Jones, Rafael Camacho and Adam Lewis would certainly add to Rangers ranks, and would cost next to nothing for Rangers. Timmy Wa, Bedfordshire.\n\nI'm not sure about that, Timmy. Even an Under-18 player at Liverpool might not come cheap in terms of wages. But I take your point, even if the players you mention are all very young to be thrown into the high-pressure atmosphere of Ibrox. Whatever may be thought of the general standard in Scotland, there are still 50,000 paying customers expecting to win. The kids you mention, while extraordinarily gifted in their age group teams, will never have experienced anything like that. It isn't quite as easy as you make it sound. Liverpool Under 18s, even Liverpool Under 23s would not win the Scottish league. Not so long ago, I saw an inexperienced Liverpool starting XI struggle to win an FA Cup tie against Exeter.\n\nSteven Gerrard will still have 50,000 paying fans turning up expecting his side to win\n\nIf Zeljko Buvac isn't coming back then Gerrard's best move would have been to become Jurgen Klopp's assistant, learn from the master and eventually take over from him. A55451N, United Kingdom.\n\nThis presumes that Klopp wants an inexperienced assistant, who is more pupil than contributor. Only the Football Association treat the manager's job as one that can be combined with the role of teacher. Klopp could have appointed any number of young ex-Liverpool players his No 2, if that is what he desired. He wanted Buvac, because he knew and trusted him across a working relationship of close to 20 years. He valued his input, even credited him with being the brain in their relationship. That is the role of an assistant. Not note taking and nodding along. Jose Mourinho wants Michael Carrick on his staff, but his assistant is Rui Faria and has been for 16 years.\n\nI agree, money does the talking in football - and the problem for Rangers is we haven't got any. We attract 50,000 home crowds, but compared with teams like Bournemouth and Watford we are paupers because of all the television money in England. Bournemouth on 12,000 crowds could buy and sell both Rangers and Celtic with home gates between 50,000 and 60,000. As a Rangers supporter for 50 years plus, I would love to see Gerrard's appointment work, but think Gerrard will become frustrated with the lack of cash and it will end in tears and acrimony. Harvestmoon, Glasgow.\n\nIt's worse than you think, HM. Bournemouth's average Premier League gate this season is actually 10,640. There are four clubs getting more in League One. And while I don't think it is strictly true that they could buy and sell the Old Firm - just the names, Celtic and Rangers, adds value Bournemouth can never possess - I do think Gerrard may find the expectations considerably outstrip his capacity to actively influence Rangers' fortunes, due to financial limitations. Were he to succeed, though, in the circumstances it would be arguably the biggest achievement in Scotland since Sir Alex Ferguson dominated with Aberdeen.\n\nPoint two: crime and punishment.\n\nIf we stopped publishing the names of people only accused and not convicted of sex crimes then maybe people found innocent in a court of law would stand half a chance of living as if they were indeed innocent. Paulusmac, Chester.\n\nI agree, Paul, but why stop at sex crimes? Why isn't all court reporting reserved until after sentence? I know most journalists would be horrified by this, and court reporting has long been an accepted part of the job, but I feel with social media society has changed and innocent lives can be greatly affected by the public nature of the process, in a way they were not before. It happened to one of my sons' friends. He went to court, and the case for the prosecution was widely reported because it is invariably the most newsworthy narrative. His defence did not get picked up the same way, and I didn't see the not guilty verdict anywhere. So Google his name and all that can be found are allegations that turned out to be without foundation. This is very unfair, but it has always been that way so we unthinkingly accept the logic and do not consider the change in our lives as a result of electronic media. I don't want to muzzle the press and much of what was discussed in parliament on Wednesday would do just that - but I do think it is worth revisiting the guidelines around court reporting. There are more important things than merely feeding the news agenda. We've got enough to write about.\n\nLook at some of the words you use in this article to describe Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding and their behaviour: 'Impossible to defend... sordid... misogynistic... degrading language... revulsion... destructive... shocking despicability'. Can't we just leave it there? These guys can volunteer at a hospice if they're at a loose end. Otis Redding, Belfast.\n\nYes, but that ignores any change that may have been made as a result of being publicly shamed. Leading a sordid life, or holding misogynistic views are character traits that can be modified if we allow people to learn.\n\nThe players haven't done anything that many, if not most, men have done at some point - sowing their wild oats. But with social media everything is recorded, whereas in in days gone by it was just talk. And 50 per cent of the planet subjugated? If anyone is subjugated these days it is men as this case illustrates. SeanL, London.\n\nI cannot see how anyone familiar with the case can see the men as the victims, but then I appear to have led a sheltered upbringing having missed out on the bit where we all went around spit-roasting sluts. Against that, I did amass a very good record collection, as you are about to discover.\n\nMartin, you're getting the facts wrong. They were on trial for rape, not for being rude, disgusting creatures, and as they were acquitted no-one is calling them rapists. We are, however, calling them out for being despicable pigs who had their chance at fame and can now join a factory floor like most other people. They weren't on trial for being disgusting and immoral idiots, so it's only fair that we, the public, punish them for it as we deem fit. Plenty of decent players can now take their place and not tarnish half of society in the process. Bronwen, Brighton.\n\nI have a problem with this. So factory floors are full of disgusting, immoral idiots, and Jackson and Olding can take their rightful place beside them, rather than indulging the higher pursuit of rugby? I don't really share that view of the working class. The factory floor is no less noble than the playing field. People used to talk the same way about Ched Evans before he was found not guilty of rape on appeal, saying he can go off and be a dustman, as if one of the most important jobs in society was fit for nothing more than sex offenders. As for we, the public, meting out our own punishments, I'm not wholly comfortable there, either. I think you're advocating a mob mentality that goes far beyond acceptable censure. We know the public would bring back hanging and would reveal the identities of the Bulger killers even though it would almost certainly lead to vigilante retribution. I think we need to be very careful around the public's sense of proportion. Olding and Jackson behaved in a disgusting and immoral way, but that can be corrected without hounding them out of the sport.\n\nDid Jackson and Olding commit a crime? No. That's why they are not in jail. Does the behaviour of Jackson and Olding deserve to be punished even though it wasn't a crime? Yes it does. Holly from Miami, United States.\n\nBut by who? The self-appointed judge and jury who presume to speak for us all, when reaction to this case very much suggests we are not all in agreement. So why should your view, alone, prevail?\n\nThey damaged the reputation of the sport through their bad behaviour. Where I come from, rugby players are like rock stars to the kids. I don't want them believing that this behaviour is acceptable. Eddie, London.\n\nSo educate them, inform them, take that responsibility. There is no way Jackson and Olding end up as role models to any parent who is engaged. And, Eddie, I'm not saying you are not.\n\nIt is grossly unethical that in a society such as ours the possibility of transformation and redemption is denied. This attitude seems widespread both on the left and the right and has little to do with a person's political persuasion. It brings the entire criminal justice system into disrepute since that was always founded on the possibility of the transformation of the individual. If that basic principle is disregarded what is the point beyond protecting society? Human beings are capable of transformation and redemption, however unlikely that may appear. If you give up on this basic idea then humans become no more than absurd, one dimensional caricatures invented by social media. It is entirely appropriate to point that out. Karllxx2, Edinburgh.\n\nMy thoughts exactly, Karl. The players might not have received a custodial sentence, but they would have to be utterly despicable and stupid not to have learned a powerful lesson from this, and modified their behaviour. They may even, in time, become a positive influence on younger, more foolish or wayward, players as a result.\n\nBarbara Keeley is MP for Eccles South and Worsley not Sale. For God's sake, Martin, keep up. You lived in Manchester years ago. Brutallbruce2, London.\n\nI said Barbara Keeley was the Sale MP. She is. In the context of that sentence, Sale is the rugby club, not the town, and it is based in Barton-upon-Irwell at AJ Bell Stadium which is in the constituency of Eccles South and Worsley. In the same way, Vicky Foxcroft is the Millwall MP. She is not the MP for Millwall the area, though, because that is in the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse.\n\nPoint three: telling it like it isn't on Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nNice piece, but it leaves a sour taste to refer to his battle and condition as a 'fixture', metaphor or not. This wasn't scheduled, or ordinary, or part of the script and wouldn't be wished on anybody. Glennjo95, Londonderry.\n\nIt was a metaphor, as you acknowledge. It was a metaphor attempting to tie Sir Alex Ferguson's renown for comebacks in his football matches, to our hope for his revival in life. Everyone else seemed to accept that. Maybe they also understood how difficult it is to write about a man who is very unwell, without it reading prematurely like his obituary. That is where the odd metaphor comes in. Ferguson's achievements are in the past tense; but to write of him in the past tense now sounds horrible. I'm not claiming mine was a good piece; but the commission in such circumstances made it a difficult one. A metaphor was used because, at the time, the reality felt too bleak. My father saw a doctor on breakfast television giving survival statistics, speculating about the future dependent on whether the bleed was on the left or right side of the brain. It fulfils the purpose of information but, frankly, I find that more insensitive than any metaphor. There could be people watching who know Alex, but not well enough to be in the loop. They could be very disturbed by these facts - many of which would not apply, given the individuality of each situation. It's easy to tweet 'Get well soon', or post two lines of fault-finding as you did, but striking the right tone across 1,500 words is complex. I admire every journalist who attempted it and I didn't read a single piece that was not considered, respectful and professional in its handling of the sad news.\n\nWhile I wish him a speedy recovery, how the hell can you say Ferguson is still at the 'pinnacle of the game'? He's a 76-year-old retired ex-manager. Ibut72, Manchester.\n\nWho remains the most successful of all time. Hence at the pinnacle, in the way Don Bradman remains the pinnacle of Test batting, and Michael Schumacher the pinnacle of Formula 1.\n\nPoint four: Xherdan Shaqiri and a matter of timing.\n\nI do not think you should question Shaqiri for wanting to move after his club, Stoke, has been relegated. He is the same footballer who won the award for the best goal in the last major European football tournament. Even if he got relegated with Stoke, he has lit up the Premier League with individual skills that other ambitious clubs would be happy to pay for. He is a professional footballer and there is nothing wrong with advertising his availability to improve his career prospects. I do not see a problem with him making a statement after the club got relegated. Please help me see the ill in this. Samal Sumandeep, Bangalore.\n\nWell, for a start, it was before Stoke were relegated, not after. My column appeared after the relegation but Shaqiri's quotes were from an article published prior to the match with Crystal Palace. So there's that. Also, as far as ambitious clubs go, weren't Stoke one? Mark Hughes signed Shaqiri and other major names hoping to play more expansive football and advance up the league. Instead, Hughes was sacked, and they were the first to go down. Shaqiri has been one of their better players but that isn't saying much. Think of his eight goals if compared to, say, Matt Le Tissier who close to single-handedly kept Southampton afloat in his playing days. He reached double figures in 11 of his first 12 seasons. That sort of return, for a player so gifted, might have made a difference. Far from lighting up the league - which he has done only occasionally - Shaqiri has been a massive disappointment but continues to think he is a great asset. Also, I know nothing of this award at the 2016 European Championship. It certainly doesn't appear to be official, although the bicycle kick versus Poland was very good.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri couldn't keep Stoke in the Premier League\n\nPoint five: Darren Moore, experience and racism.\n\nHere the English media go again. Darren Moore beat Manchester United, Tottenham and drew with Liverpool so he can even thrash Real Madrid and Barcelona at this point with the determined football West Brom are playing. The Championship is a different ball game entirely and 46 games is no joke. This West Brom team is not good enough to challenge for an instant return to the Premier League. Jim Caddy, Lagos.\n\nWho mentioned Real Madrid and Barcelona? I simply said he was good enough to manage West Brom; which he is.\n\nIt would take only one black manager to do a half decent job and every other club would have a black manager the following season. People can't seriously believe racism would stop the money men from hiring the best person for the job. If that was the case, English football would be full of teams playing 11 white Englishmen. Financial success trumps racism every time. Tone, Leicester.\n\nI agree. The idea owners would reject a candidate who brought success on the grounds he is black rather overlooks the priorities in most boardrooms. However, I think there are a number of black managers who have done a very decent jobs. Chris Hughton at Brighton this season, for instance, has been excellent.\n\nNobody knows until someone is given a chance, and Moore has passed his test to be given the job. What experience does the current England manager have? Wyavia, London.\n\nExactly. I was going to include Gareth Southgate in the list of caretaker appointments that have worked out, but thought that might be presumptive without playing a finals tournament. Certainly, though, he was identified as suitable without great experience in the role. At the very least Moore should be part of West Brom's interview process and allowed to set out his vision for the club.\n\nUnbeaten, manager of the month and relegated - it's been a busy few weeks for Darren Moore\n\nWe all know why Moore's not getting the job, Martin, and you know, too - but you are trying to be professional and diplomatic in your write up, so you aren't saying it. Tayop, London.\n\nYes, I'm known for my diplomacy. Look, if I thought this was about race I would say so. I might have to be careful for legal reasons, but I would find a way of getting that point across. The fact is, I don't. I think this is about a misguided desire for experience and the inability to accept a game-changing run of results and the emergence of a serious candidate who had not previously been considered.\n\nLet West Brom's owners decide who to appoint. They're paying. Dean Smith of Brentford is a far better coach than Moore. Haymanfan, London.\n\nFine, but why? Don't just drop that in as if it is a statement of irrefutable fact. Make your case. Give us evidence. Before I compared Moore and Smith, I spent significant time going back through Smith's record, particularly against bigger clubs. I didn't want to write that he had nothing on his CV like Moore's victories against Manchester United and Tottenham, only to then find he'd knocked out Chelsea and Arsenal in the cup. So I know it hasn't happened. I know his record isn't really one of exceeding expectations, although he's just had a decent season at Brentford. If you know better, make the argument. Otherwise it's just gossip, folks (and the uncensored one, so don't click if, like me, you've never heard swearing before).\n\nLaughable if you think a guy with zero experience should get the job over Michael Appleton. He totally transformed Oxford from a struggling League Two club to challenging for a place in the Championship in less than three years, with two Wembley appearances, and numerous giant killings. But yeah, give it to the guy who has been in charge a couple of weeks because the team managed not to lose all the time like normal - or maybe there are other non-football reasons you want him to have it so you can virtue signal? OwenJonesIsAWhopper, United Kingdom.\n\nWell, I'm making a signal right now, but I'm not sure it's virtuous. You mean I want a black man to get the job because he's black, yes? Not because he might have impressed in a brief interim period; not because he knows the club and the players and they respond positively to him; not because his start has been so impressive he merits a longer term opportunity. Appleton did well at Oxford, I know that. But that doesn't automatically make him a better candidate than Moore. Isn't Appleton assistant to Claude Puel at Leicester right now? How's that working out?\n\nIt's one thing getting a run of results at the back end of a dismal season, when you are basically relegated and the pressure is off. While not denigrating the job Moore has done it boils down to him doing what he previously did, coaching the players, with the added part of picking the team and deciding tactics. While he has done that last part admirably that doesn't mean he is qualified to take the job full time. Does he know the Championship transfer market? Can he tear apart a squad and rebuild it? Can he successfully recruit the players he would need? Can he man manage the current squad to get rid of the players he needs to discard? Can he adapt his tactics to the games in the Championship against the likes of Millwall? I'm not saying he can't but it would be a jump into the unknown that West Brom can't afford. As my club, Wolves, and Sunderland found out the hard way, the first relegated season is a dangerous time and not one for risks. Dave2543, United Kingdom.\n\nThe 'added part' of picking the team and deciding tactics as you have it, Dave, isn't just some extra filing. Certainly not when the tactics have to stand up against the likes of Jose Mourinho, Mauricio Pochettino, Rafael Benitez and Jurgen Klopp. If Moore pulled that off, might he not also have some idea about transfer markets, reshaping a squad and taking on Millwall? We'll never know unless he is given a chance. If he doesn't get the job, whoever takes his place will one day have been a novice manager, too - a young manager who needed an employer to see his promise and give him an opportunity. That is what we all needed at one time - an opportunity. Not everyone takes it, not everyone makes it - but Moore deserves his.\n\nThe trouble is, if the West Brom board don't fancy Moore but appoint him because of fan pressure, how much support will they give him? Like Roman Abramovich and Roberto Di Matteo, there's only ever one winner when a manager has the audacity to be more a more popular choice than the owners man. Hope it works out for Moore but maybe he's better off using his enhanced reputation to find another position if it's obvious the West Brom board don't appreciate his efforts. Nick, Aylesbury.\n\nFair point, Nick - although as West Brom is Moore's club he might prefer to take his chances and try to prove a few above him wrong. They couldn't sack a winning manager.\n\nWhen ex-Aston Villa and England defender Ugo Ehigo died tragically young last year, everyone lauded his distinguished playing career and also what a gifted, motivational and innovative coach he was, having completed his UEFA badges. At the time he was coaching Tottenham's under-23 team as he had struggled to find a job as a senior coach at a Premier League club. Meanwhile, his fellow centre-half at Aston Villa, the same age and having completed his UEFA badges at exactly the same time, is the England manager. That is a nice little case study in everything you need to know about race and football management in this country. I saw an article last weekend about Moore and the fantastic job he has done since Alan Pardew left. It hinted the position was now his. I chuckled and thought 'let's wait and see', so am not surprised. TheFinalWord, Manchester.\n\nIt might be a matter of opportunity, or it might be that Southgate was a better coach than Ehiogu. He was certainly a better centre-half. Look, if Ehiogu was as good a coach as was claimed when he died - and, remember, few athletes get a bad review in death - it does not reflect well on the opportunities presented for young, black coaches in English football. I think it is harsh, though, to suggest Southgate got his opportunity because he was white. There are a lot of white managers who feel their face doesn't fit at the Football Association, that they aren't right for the famous blazer, just the same. People will tell you that was why Roy Hodgson got the nod over Harry Redknapp, why Terry Venables got one tournament and lesser managers got three. I understand but, like the career paths of Southgate and Ehiogu, it may be too simplistic to put it all down to prejudice and injustice.\n\nIt is telling that Samuel said everything else about why Moore deserves the job, yet it is patently clear he was steering away from the most obvious reason for not getting it, being scared to tackle racism in English football. Sweeping it under the carpet won't make racism go away. Instead it will keep rearing its ugly head with glaring stories such as that of Gerrard and Moore. Racism is institutionalised in English football and until changes are brought by the body running it nothing will make these clubs change the status quo. Ultimately, this will be the undoing of English football, which purports to be at the forefront of tackling racism. The facts speak for themselves. It is ironic that even the Royal family is about to splash its blood with a tinge of black, yet a decidedly peasant club like West Brom thinks black isn't good enough. Tinyiko, Johannesburg.\n\nThis is just nonsense. I'll call racism if I see it, but if West Brom's board were racists why give Moore the chance in the first place? If anything, this could end up entirely counter productive if directors fear that appointing a black man will give them less freedom to manoeuvre if they wish to then make a change. It's insulting to Moore, too, if we reduce this purely to a row about race. His appointment would be deserved, not token. He doesn't deserve it because that strikes a blow against racism; he deserves it because he's done a damn good job.\n\nMoore's West Brom side won their final home game of the season - 1-0 against Tottenham\n\nInexperience is not the reason that Moore may not get the West Brom job and I do not have to spell it out. Gerrard coached Liverpool's Under 18s for one year and has walked in as Rangers coach. Remember when Chris Hughton was sacked by Newcastle although the team was sitting comfortably in 11th place? The reason was that they needed a more high profile manager and Pardew got the job. Please don't say it is not race because it surely is. Pardew, Sam Allardyce. Tony Pulis, Mark Hughes, David Moyes keep flopping and being recycled. Kengooner, United States.\n\nAll of the managers you mention are largely given mid-table teams that are at risk to one bad season - so, yes, occasionally they fail. Most, however, have done very competent jobs throughout their careers which is why they keep getting re-employed. And to that list of journeyman managers we can add the man you mentioned, Hughton. He's a solid citizen, just like Allardyce and Pulis and the rest - that's why he stays in work. As for Gerrard, if you cannot see why employing such an iconic figure in football would appeal to Rangers ahead of worthier candidates, you do not know the way modern football works. They want a marquee name, they want profile, they want to be a media draw, a television draw, a draw for supporters and consumers alike. Gerrard is box office, the way it was thought John Barnes might be at Celtic. Nothing to do with skin colour.\n\nMoore is missing the ingredient you are born with and cannot change to get a managers job. He is not the only one affected and it continues to be a disgrace. If his fellow players with similar characteristics boycotted there would be no Premier League and 80 per cent of the England team would go. Blakmusleftsnowiegy, United Kingdom.\n\nThere would be considerably fewer black millionaires, too - the racist world of football being one of the few industries that produces them, by the conveyer belt.\n\nNo black referees, linesmen and one black coach in the Premier League. Speaks volumes. Briggie, Brooklyn.\n\nThere was a black referee in the Premier League, his name was Uriah Rennie and he was very poor. Indeed, many managers felt had he not been black, he would have been demoted sooner but the authorities did not want to ditch such an obvious standard bearer.\n\nWhy single out West Brom? Every team and fan against the Rooney Rule is against Moore and anyone of his ilk being given a fair chance. That's all it is, a fair chance. Not an unfair advantage as is constantly stated. The same people never supported England's most gifted player, John Barnes, yet propped up a lesser player in Paul Gascoigne. It is easy to point fingers at the Russians and Italians when there are issues here relating to football. If Moore gets a chance it will be with a side that has very little chance of stability in order to ensure failure so they can say 'told you, we gave one a chance and it didn't work'. Abs, Manchester.\n\nSorry, but this is just nonsense. I'm against the Rooney Rule, certainly during the season, but for purely practical reasons. I also thought Paul Gascoigne was a better footballer than John Barnes. But, hey, I also thought Barnes was better than a load of other white contemporaries, so now I'm confused. Am I racist, or is your argument specious - I'm going with the latter. Not least because if Moore doesn't get the West Brom job it's because of racism, but if he does, it's only because whitey wants him to fail so we can bar all the other black men from managerial positions. Can't really win this one, can we?\n\nIt's because Moore is black. No other reason. The same way Sol Campbell can't get a job but Steven Gerrard can. Race is a major issue in British football, even down to the Sunday Supplement show that you are on sometimes. Very rarely do they have a journalist on of African or Asian descent. What's the reason? Race! It's disgusting, really. NaSei Bonsu, London.\n\nYou want to shout 'Race!' or do you want the reason? Well, for many years, the most qualified and articulate black sports journalist in the country, Darren Lewis of the Daily Mirror, was appearing on another television programme that started at the same time as the Supplement, so couldn't guest. His working arrangements have since changed, so now he is a regular and the show is much the better for it. Equally, the Supplement relies on journalists in senior positions at their newspaper - chief sports writer, chief football writer, Manchester correspondent - and not every writer of ethnic origin has a role that provides such a platform. So Adrian Kajumba of the Daily Mirror will not be on, for the same reason I wouldn't have been on when I came to London from Manchester - I didn't occupy a senior post. Over time, as more journalists of African or Asian descent forge career paths that take them up the ladder, the make-up of the panel will change. One programme this year featured Jonathan Liew of The Independent, my colleague Sami Mokbel and Vaishali Bjardwaj of the Evening Standard, none of whom have ever been unknowingly confused with Arthur Mullard. That is what the future could look like. It will get there. As for Campbell, he has barely uttered a word since retirement - from saying he could be London Mayor to announcing he should have been England captain, when they were plainly more suitable candidates - that would appeal to potential employers. It is not race that is keeping Sol Campbell out of management; it's Sol Campbell.\n\nStop this now. Let's focus on the individual and his ability, not his colour. Moore has shown he can handle the job even under immense pressure. Ace, Nigeria.\n\nToo right, Ace. Too many people projecting their own hot topics onto a straightforward football matter. Does Moore deserve his chance? Yes. Has he earned it? Yes. Ace, let's leave via Nigeria. Not all the best psych-rock came from the west.

Today, Trump has launched a tariff race with China, an economic superpower, perhaps with similarly far-reaching potential consequences. Like under Reagan, the US is better placed to win the current competition with China -- but the risks are sizeable.\n\nIn the latest escalation of the trade dispute, the US imposed levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports. China immediately implemented retaliatory tariffs, spurring the US to threaten even more protectionist measures. These actions exacerbate tensions over the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on imports from other countries, including some of America's closest allies, and its threats to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation, which undergirds the rules-based system regulating cross-border flows of goods, services, and capital.\n\nMany existing trade agreements would benefit from modernisation. And most economists agree that the US has genuine trade grievances against China, including intellectual property theft, asymmetrical technology transfers, and non-tariff barriers, such as the requirement that foreign companies enter joint-venture agreements with domestic firms to access the Chinese market.\n\nBut most economists also agree that competitive tariffs are a risky way to address these grievances. Because tariffs transmit stagflationary pressures (that is, they encourage simultaneous economic contraction and inflation), they risk undermining a global recovery that is already facing challenges. And they complicate long-overdue monetary-policy normalisation, while increasing the likelihood of global financial instability.\n\nThe resulting systemic cracks could jeopardise the entire rules-based multilateral trading system at a time when there is no good alternative.\n\nMany economists hesitate on precisely what lies ahead. For example, one group, while recognising that the current tensions increase the risk of a policy accident or mistake, views them as part of a process of posturing and negotiation. When push comes to shove, they argue, the world's major trade powers will avoid a mutually destructive approach, opting instead for negotiations that yield a still-free but fairer regime.\n\nReinforcing this view are preliminary indications that the European Union may now be willing to consider a zero-tariff automobile initiative.\n\nAnother group, citing historical precedent, warns that beggar-thy-neighbour trade measures can quickly spiral out of control, taking a heavy toll on living standards. At a time of pronounced political polarisation, anti-establishment anger, and mistrust of expert opinion -- owing to economic disappointments and widespread fear of cultural and technological change -- heightened protectionism would likely fuel even greater nationalism, populism, and inward-looking policymaking.\n\nBut the comparison to Reagan suggests that there may be other broader, implications. By forcing the Soviet Union into a military spending race that only the US could win (at the cost of rising debt and a higher risk of conflict), Reagan accelerated the demise of what he called the \"evil empire\".\n\nIt was a bold and risky strategy that ultimately changed the political map of Europe. Even before the Soviet Union's demise, resulting in 15 new countries, its European \"empire\" had collapsed. The Berlin Wall had fallen, bringing German reunification, and Yugoslavia was disintegrating.\n\nSoon after, Czechoslovakia's \"Velvet Divorce\" gave rise to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which -- together with other Central and Eastern European countries (including Hungary and Poland) -- then anchored themselves firmly in the West by joining Nato and the EU.\n\nToday, a trade war would damage all economies. But the US -- which is relatively less dependent on foreign markets, possesses deeper domestic markets, and is generally more economically resilient than other countries -- would do better than most others in a contracting world economy. Already, Chinese financial markets have suffered, while those in the US have held their own.\n\nGame theory suggests that rational actors, recognising how damaging a trade war would be for them, would see the merit of abandoning a retaliatory strategy, and instead accede to many US demands. All of this could leave the US more able and willing to halt the multi-year erosion of its global economic influence and standing.\n\nBut the success of this approach is far from guaranteed. Its execution will require more mutual trust than is currently on offer. A divided US public will need to be kept on board throughout the retaliatory phase, which will lead to higher prices and, in some cases, greater job insecurity.\n\nFurthermore, the Trump administration will need to avoid actually pushing other countries too hard too soon, thereby threatening the entire global economy with a possible recession and markets with disorderly declines. Already, the US Federal Reserve, relying on its contacts in the domestic business community, has warned that corporate investment plans could be \"scaled back or postponed\" because of uncertainty over global trade relations.\n\nAnd let us not forget that China holds a massive volume of US Treasury bonds which, if pushed too hard, it could use to try to destabilise the US government bond market, which is essential to the health of the global financial system.\n\nIt is too early to say whether a \"Reagan moment\" on trade will play out and deliver more than a fairer system. After all, such an approach would require careful strategic design and skilful implementation -- not to mention plenty of good luck -- guided by a nuanced understanding of economic, political, and geopolitical factors.\n\nThat is why we must move beyond the question of whether this is a trade skirmish or a trade war to develop real strategies for the \"Trump trade moment,\" should it arrive.\n\n-- Project Syndicate, 2018\n\nMohamed A.

But North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's walk across the border into South Korea on Friday was revealed to his own oppressed people only yesterday.\n\nThe totalitarian state's main broadcaster finally broke the news in the afternoon, more than 12 hours after Kim returned home to recover from a drink-fuelled state banquet in South Korea following his peace summit with President Moon Jai In.\n\nThe adulatory news bulletin praised Kim's mastery in initiating the denuclearisation talks and hailed them as a milestone towards unification.\n\nDetails of the talks emerged yesterday as observers reported that notorious bon viveur Kim, who dispensed with his trademark horn-rimmed glassed, was bleary-eyed as he gulped champagne at the lavish banquet and his officials invited 'McDonald's-style' US investment.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in toasts North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his wife Ri Sol Ju at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un holds a glass with South Korean President Moon Jae-in\n\nIn an unguarded moment, Kim reportedly said he was 'embarrassed' by North Korea's 'poor infrastructure' when President Moon told him he wanted to visit his communist neighbour and climb Mount Paektu.\n\nKim was unexpectedly joined at the banquet by his wife - former cheerleader Ri Sol Ju. She crossed the border hours after her husband, despite not being on the official guest list. Her appearance came days after Ri, who is said to have three children with Kim, was declared first lady - a title never before granted by the misogynistic North Korean dynasty.\n\nIt is believed to have been Ri's first visit to South Korea since she was a 16-year-old member of the North Korean cheerleading team that attended the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships.\n\nKim's sister Kim Yo Jong, who is seen as the dictator's unofficial chief-of-staff, was constantly at his side, taking copious notes and blushing as her brother joked to President Moon that she was a 'star'.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in pose for photos in front of Bukhansan Peace House\n\nA senior South Korean official said Kim's officials indicated at the banquet that their leader wanted his country to become 'normal'.

'They want American investment,' he told US broadcaster CNN.\n\nThe South Korean summit is expected to be followed by talks between Kim and Donald Trump, possibly in Singapore or Mongolia next month or in June.\n\nPresident Trump, who claimed credit for Friday's summit, said: 'We'll be setting up a meeting very shortly. We have it broken down to probably two sites. And hopefully we're going to have great success.'", "But there have been few actual tangible measures agreed to heal relations\n\nAfter the extraordinary meeting between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, the two leaders issued a statement outlining measures to improve relations between the two countries.\n\nThe Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula, commits the two countries to denuclearization and talks to formally end the Korea War, 65 years after hostilities ended.\n\nBut the declaration, named after the village in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two countries, contains many aspirations and appears to be short on detail about what has actually been agreed.\n\nKim Jong-un shakes hands with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the border between the two Koreas in the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)\n\nThe two sides have been negotiating on and off since 1972 and much of what has been agreed between Kim and Moon Jae-in has been said before. So what tangible measures have agreed at the meeting?\n\nInter-Korean Exchanges\n\nChung Gum Hwang and Yunjong Won lead out North Korean and South Korean athletes during the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games (Mike Egerton/PA Images)\n\nFollowing the Winter Olympics, when the two Koreas marched together at the opening ceremony and had a joint ice-hockey team, the two countries have agreed to send joint teams to future events such as the 2018 Asian Games.\n\nThe leaders also agreed to address the highly emotive issue of reunions between families divided by the war and the border, and to resurrect family visits, which were ended in 2015 as relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated.\n\nThe two sides agreed to hold 'reunion programmes' on August 15, the day both Koreas celebrate their independence from Japanese colonisation.\n\nAfter Moon took office last May, his administration quickly asked that the visits resume, but North Korea never officially responded.\n\nSouth Korean Min Ho-Sik, centre, 84, hugs his North Korean relative Min Eun-Sik, right, 81, during a family reunion meeting\n\nNorth Korean state media implied that the programme could be resumed if South Korea sent back a dozen North Korean waitresses who defected to the South after working at a restaurant in China, but that demand appears to have been dropped.\n\nIn order to build on the breakthrough in relations achieved at Panmunjon, the two sides have agree to establish joint liaison office with resident representatives of both sides in the Kaesong industrial zone on their border.\n\nCurrently, the two Koreas have respective liaison offices on each side of the border and use phones and fax machines for communication.\n\nOfficials will from both sides will be based at the office, located in an area where North Korean workers are employed by South Korean companies, with the aim of smoothing communications between the two countries.\n\nDe-escalating tension in the Demilitarized Zone\n\nAs well as agreeing to begin moves to formally end the Korean War, the two leaders also agreed measures to east tension the Demilitarised Zone.\n\nThe DMZ, which is 2.5 miles wide and snakes for 150 miles along the 38th parallel, was drawn in the 1953 armistice that ended three years of bitter fighting.\n\nOver the years, it has not just been a physical frontier but a potent symbol of the tensions between the two Koreas, who blare out propaganda messages across their borders using enormous loudspeakers.\n\nA South Korean guard straddles the demarcation line: the right half of the table is in North Korea\n\nThere has also been a bizarre rivalry over flagpole sizes which started during the 1980s, when the South Korean government built one 321.5-foot tall, prompting the North Korea to responded by building a 525-foot one.\n\nBut North and South Korea have agreed to turn it into a peace zone as of May 1 with both sides agreeing to end 'hostile acts' including the broadcasts and the distribution of propaganda leaflets.\n\nThey have also agreed to hold frequent defence ministerial and working-level meetings in a bid to immediately discuss and solve military issues, with the first military talks to be held in May at the rank of general.\n\nStill to be negotiated - a nuclear free Korean peninsula and then unification\n\nIn a joint statement Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in pledged to work towards a 'a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization'\n\nDetails of that would be achieved was not made clear and many analysts remain sceptical about the North's apparent conversion to a nuclear free peninsula.\n\nMajor uncertainty still surrounds North Korea's commitment to 'denuclearize' and what it would demand in return.\n\nStarting in the early 1990s, the North has built up a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent against a U.S. invasion and as a safeguard for the continuance of its totalitarian regime.\n\nNorth Korean has been working towards acquiring nuclear weapons since the early 1990s and many analysts are sceptical about its conversion to denucleasization\n\nChristopher Hill, who was the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea under the George W. Bush administration, said the onus would be on the Trump administration to work out the details of a deal.\n\nKey hurdles would be to establish a timetable for denuclearization and to overcome North Korean reluctance to allow a verification process.\n\n'I'm guided by my experience which was they said all the right things but they gave us a declaration that was not complete and not entirely accurate, and they also failed to give us any kind of verification protocol,' Hill said.\n\nAs for unification, the idea remains a distant dream, though one brought a small step nearer by the agreement to end the war, a precondition for talks both sides have long held.\n\nThe first priority, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry, is to develop a sustainable relationship and resolve the issue of North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.\n\nSouth Korea wants to then develop trust and cooperation to the point where a sort of national consensus has been achieved.\n\nAfter a transitional commonwealth period, the next step would be the formation of a single market on the Korean Peninsula 'to create new growth engines and create an inter-Korean economic community of coexistence and co-prosperity.'", "Beholder 2, set to release in 3D this time, and takes place in the same grim and hopeless dystopian Beholder universe where privacy is dead and a totalitarian State controls every aspect of life ruled by the same \"Wise Leader.\"\n\nBeholder 2 will feature an expansive world filled with new scenes, rooms, floors inside the actual Ministry.\n\nThe brand new storyline which is still in development takes place sometime after the events of the original Beholder Game; you will experience the inner workings and career-path of the Ministry.

Feeling at home matters, too.\n\nThis is the first time the tournament has been held in eastern Europe, and the first time in six editions that two teams from that part of the world have reached the quarter-finals. Russia and Croatia will meet in Sochi on Saturday, emulating the achievement of Romania and Bulgaria, who progressed to the semi-finals in 1994. That is surely not coincidence.\n\nOf course, it helps to have Luka Modric as your main man. Certainly it is not merely location, location, location. It does not follow that every South American nation thrives at a South American World Cup, just as Serbia and Poland - the other eastern European nations here - did not make it out of the group stage.\n\nIt is surely no coincidence that Croatia have thrived in the familiar surroundings of Russia\n\nYet there has been some unlikely success in World Cups past for nations that just seemed to fit their surroundings. Think of Costa Rica and Uruguay's progress from Italy and England's group in Brazil in 2014; or that Chile utterly outplayed Spain, and qualified at their expense.\n\nIn 2010, at the first African World Cup, Ghana would have been the only nation from that continent ever to reach the tournament's semi-finals, had it not been for Luis Suarez's handball on the line in the last minute of extra time against Uruguay. Since then, no African nation has returned to the quarter-finals, and none emerged from the group stages here.\n\nAt the first Asian World Cup, in 2002, Japan and South Korea - against all expectations - won their respective groups and the Koreans made it as far as the semi-finals, eliminating Spain and Italy in the process. Russia's progress here has amazed, but South Korea's was stunning, as was some of the refereeing.\n\nSouth Korea's 2002 run to the semi-finals shows home advantage plays a role at the World Cup\n\nComfort is important on tour. On the night before they played Spain, Chile took over the Dom Rosso Grill Bar at the Radisson hotel in Barra da Tijuca. Kids ran amok. Wives and girlfriends sashayed between tables with caipirinhas.\n\nTheir coach, Jorge Sampaoli, held court with his feet on a table, among pals in the lobby. This was a completely South American scene. By contrast, Spain played as if rigid with fear.\n\nAnd, yes, 760 miles separate Croatia and Russia, roughly as much as lies between London and Oslo. Yet the Vikings and the Angles were not so very different, just as Croatia would identify as an east European nation, despite being closer to Italy.\n\nVedran Corluka now plays for Lokomotiv Moscow and assistant coach Ivica Olic, a hero at CSKA Moscow, was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship.\n\nRussia in the quarter-finals certainly isn't an away fixture, as it would be for many others\n\nThree other Croatian players have spent time with Ukrainian clubs and the Croatian league is peppered with names recognisable from Russian football: Lokomotiva, Dinamo.\n\nSo Croatia isn't Russia, just as Costa Rica isn't Brazil - but nor is this an away fixture, as it is for others. East is east, and Russia could not come up against more troublesome opponents in the next round than a team that also appear to have their feet under the table.\n\nMascherano's legs had gone\n\nJavier Mascherano made 147 appearances for Argentina, but the 144th onwards sadly overstretched a great player.\n\nAt this World Cup, Mascherano moved past Javier Zanetti as the most-capped Argentina international, but his legs had gone and he was playing on memory and force of will.\n\nJavier Mascherano won 147 caps but the 144th onwards sadly overstretched a great player\n\nAfter Argentina leaked four goals to France - in part because Mascherano offered a weak defence little cover - he announced his decision to retire from international football. Sadly, like many of the greats, it was more that it retired from him.\n\nYou will be hearing a lot in the coming days from Richard Freeman, the doctor who gave Bradley Wiggins the corticosteroid triamcinolone under therapeutic use exemption before his 2012 Tour de France win.\n\nRichard Freeman ducked an internal probe\n\nHe was also responsible for the infamous Jiffy bag, that made its way across Europe, the contents unknown due to 'a lack of accurate medical records'.\n\nFreeman ducked the internal probe at British Cycling and also a parliamentary hearing, giving only written evidence, but, glory be, he has a book out so is doing the rounds. Well, some of them.\n\nFor the only interview with Freeman worth reading would be with my colleague Matt Lawton, who has a forensic knowledge of this case, and many others affecting British Cycling.\n\nYet despite 'countless' - Matt's words - requests for formal interviews, or just comment, Freeman will not respond.\n\nSo allow me. Dr Freeman, Matt says he is ready for a good old chinwag any time you fancy. He'll even leave his number for you again, just in case you've lost that, too.\n\nKeep fans in the loop on VAR\n\nAt the next World Cup, or even sooner, fans at the stadium may be able to hear the conversation between the referee and his VAR team. Quite rightly, too. It is ridiculous that those who have incurred the expense and inconvenience of going should be in the dark about the game they have paid to see.\n\nFans at stadiums should be able to hear the conversation between a referee and his VAR team\n\nThe process works in rugby and cricket where the review is clearly outlined in real time. Equally, it is highly unlikely that football's television paymasters will allow their viewers to be out of the loop much longer. Football must then ensure its paying customers are similarly well informed or there will be no point in going at all.\n\nKasper unlucky - but also annoying\n\nKasper Schmeichel was very unlucky to exit the World Cup on Sunday, having saved three penalties - one in the final minutes of extra time, two in the shootout. But, good grief, is he annoying?\n\nWhether screaming in the referee's face in protest at the most obvious penalty ever given, or chasing after him to complain about a stuttered run - when we now know goalkeepers strayed off their line for 15 of the 19 penalties taken that day, and Schmeichel did in four of Croatia's five - the Leicester man was a perpetual nuisance.\n\nAlso, how smart did the change to the double jeopardy rule look when Luka Modric missed the penalty given as the match entered its final minutes? Ante Rebic did not even have a last man to beat when he was felled from behind by Mathias Jorgensen, having already rounded Schmeichel.\n\nKasper Schmeichel was unlucky to exit the World Cup but was a constant nuisance on Sunday\n\nHe was a matter of yards from running the ball into an empty net. Yet, because a penalty had been awarded, the new ruling is that a player cannot be punished twice for the same offence, so Jorgensen escaped with a yellow card.\n\nIt did not matter greatly because the match was close to over, but if that had happened in the first minute, Denmark would have sailed on with 11 players, and no disadvantage once the penalty was missed.\n\nIt is a joke, particularly as players are still sent off for handling on the goal-line, as Carlos Sanchez of Colombia was against Japan after three minutes. There was no difference between his action and that of Jorgensen, and both prevented certain goals being scored. The rules must be tightened up.\n\nTour right to be hard on Froome\n\nArticle 29 of the Amaury Sport Organisation's rules made it very clear. 'ASO expressly reserves the right to refuse the participation in - or disqualify from - the event, a team or one of its members whose presence is liable to damage the image or reputation of ASO or those of the event.' As one of the competitions run by Amaury is the Tour de France, they would have had Chris Froome bang to rights.\n\nFor article 29 transcends process, or right and wrong, or even fairness. It merely asks whether, by your very presence, you could harm the standing of the Tour. And while Froome had an unresolved doping allegation over his head, he most certainly could.\n\nChris Froome was cleared by the UCI and will be free to compete in the Tour de France\n\nASO were ready to cite, as precedent, Froome's hugely controversial victory in the Giro d'Italia, despite the lack of resolution on his appeal against an adverse analytical finding at last year's Vuelta a Espana.\n\nEvery achievement at the Giro had been viewed through the lens of the double dose of salbutamol found in his system after stage 18 at the Vuelta. Until that case concluded, of course Froome's presence damaged the image of cycling events. In a sport that still struggles for credibility post-Lance Armstrong, the best rider in the world needed to be clean beyond suspicion and, until Monday, Froome was not.\n\n'We are confident that Chris will be riding the Tour as we know he has done nothing wrong,' said Team Sky. But it was never as simple as that. Until Froome was officially cleared by WADA and the UCI, what Team Sky claimed to know, or their protestations of innocence, was irrelevant.\n\nHis presence alone was 'liable to damage the image or reputation . . . of the event' and article 29 made the next course of action clear. If Froome had not been cleared, it should have been impossible for him to compete.\n\nRussia 2018 is a PR job... like every sporting event\n\n'I hope the Russians love their children, too,' sang Sting. Sting's an idiot. Of course the Russians love their children. All nations, all races, love their children. We're human, we're genetically programmed. All species are, otherwise they won't survive.\n\nSo the widening surprise that the Russian people are not all knuckle-duster wearing hooligans is rather mystifying. Russian people are no different to us. Russian governments, that's another matter.\n\nThere is a lot of revisionism around our view of Russia in the light of this World Cup, but we are in a country engaging in a month-long propaganda exercise, to alter its perception in the West, as part of its foreign policy.\n\nRussian people are no different to us but Russian governments, that's another matter\n\nThis means that when instances such as the Crimea annexation, the atrocities in Syria or the attempted murders in Salisbury occur, it makes it easier for Russia to manipulate public perceptions. Visitors cannot be made to feel they are in a totalitarian state if that policy is to work and, right now, it is operating to perfection.\n\nAt the moment, Russia could be anywhere, just better run. The metro in the major cities is - as it has always been, by the way, this is no World Cup special - quite magnificent. The idea that Transport for London is tendering to run the metro in Buenos Aires is absolutely laughable.\n\nPublic transport in Russia is a different class and much cheaper to use than in England\n\nPublic transport here is a different class, and cheap. On the way home from Russia's win over Spain, I watched some of the first half of Croatia versus Denmark on one of the televisions installed in the train carriage. Can you imagine? Similarly, the stadiums are immaculate, the security efficient and friendly, and the people charming.\n\nBut people are charming, most of them. The world over they will try to help if they can, they will try to understand, to empathise, to find a common bond. And they will smile. Why should Russia be any different? Yet never forget that this is also a foreign policy strategy on behalf of the state. All major sporting events of this kind are. Yes, even London 2012. We were nicer back then, too, if you remember.\n\nWimbledon has started so there will no doubt be much talk about John McEnroe's salary and the fact it was revealed to be 10 times more than Martina Navratilova's for the same job.\n\nBut it isn't the same job. Listen to McEnroe, and then listen to everyone else. He will be earning 10 times more than some of his male counterparts, too: because he's 10 times the analyst.\n\nMarouane Fellaini is a better player than given credit for and has proved as much for Belgium\n\nAfter several months of brinkmanship, Marouane Fellaini signed on for another two years at Manchester United. No surprise there. Where, exactly, was going to be better?\n\nFellaini might not start regularly, but he is crucial to Jose Mourinho's second-half strategies when he is looking to close a game down or go direct in search of a goal. As he demonstrated against England last week, Fellaini is a better player than he is given credit for, and Mourinho's United are perfect for him. Whether this is what United's fans wanted from the summer is another matter.\n\nGet on with it, Serena\n\nAll tennis players say they are quite happy with stringent doping controls and are fully behind a drug-free sport. At the same time, they never stop moaning about being tested. Serena Williams says she was visited five times in June. She says she's fine with that, 'as long as everyone is being treated equally'.\n\nIn other words, everyone is being tested five times in June. But that won't happen. Testers always target athletes recently returned from injury or absence - Roger Federer says he has been tested seven times in a month - and Williams is at the pinnacle of her sport.\n\nSerena Williams has to be seen to be clean due to her position as the face of women's tennis\n\nIt matters that all athletes are clean, but an obscure player on the challenger circuit does not represent tennis like Williams does. Athletes fail drug tests and nobody remembers their names - but it resonates when the sport catches Ben Johnson or Marion Jones, those at the top of the tree.\n\nSo even if Williams wasn't returning from pregnancy, it would be right that she was afforded special attention. As the face of women's tennis, she has to be seen to be clean.\n\nGreat competitions are hard to win, harder to retain. That is what makes Real Madrid's three Champions League titles on the spin so special.\n\nThe last three winners of the World Cup - Germany, Spain and Italy - have now gone out at the group stage defending their crown. This is the sign of a successful, healthy competition; so, naturally, FIFA want to change it.\n\nGermany's group stage exit shows that great competitions are hard to win, harder to retain\n\nHow delightful that after all the paranoia around dirty tricks in Russia, the one injury that has been attributed to the hosts is Marcelo's back spasm, which Brazil doctor Rodrigo Lasmar blamed on a bed being too soft. It reminds of the methods of torture favoured by Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition. 'Cardinal, bring the comfy chair . . .

The lecture came not long after Donald Trump's press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. The talk was Obama's most extensive reflection so far on the current political climate, though it did not once mention Trump by name. The lecture is edited, but not much. -- David Remnick\n\nWhen my staff told me that I was to deliver a lecture, I thought back to the stuffy old professors in bow ties and tweed, and I wondered if this was one more sign of the stage of life that I'm entering, along with gray hair and slightly failing eyesight. I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture. I thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didn't conform to two-minute sound bites. But given the strange and uncertain times that we are in -- and they are strange, and they are uncertain -- with each day's news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. So I hope you'll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where we've been and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a roadmap for where we need to go next.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of Mvezo. In his autobiography he describes a happy childhood: he's looking after cattle; he's playing with the other boys. [He] eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And, as many of you know, he's quoted saying, \"Why she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.\"\n\nThere was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid. Most of Africa, including my father's homeland, was under colonial rule. The dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madiba's birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labor. The inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given.\n\nSuch a view of the world -- that certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquest -- that view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks. Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And, by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks. Around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and color and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country.\n\nThat was the world just a hundred years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second world war, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the twentieth century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual.\n\nIn those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed, and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted, and access to public education was expanded, and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. In my own country, the moral force of the civil-rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalized groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship.\n\nIt was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homeland -- a fight to end apartheid, a fight to insure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised nonwhite citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs.\n\nMadiba's light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late seventies he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to re\u00ebxamine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when, later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, you'll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world.\n\nDo you remember that feeling? It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted people's lives and confined the human spirit -- that all that was crumbling before our eyes. Then, as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections, as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood that -- we understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world.\n\nDuring the last decades of the twentieth century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesn't mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward. Yes, there were still tragedies -- bloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo. Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear d\u00e9tente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the world's system of trade -- all that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the world's great powers. From Europe to Africa, Latin America to Southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies. The march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive.\n\nWith these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies, along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadn't counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power. They had the possibilities of doing business. And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts. Suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted. And, meanwhile, the spread of the Internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially all the world's knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village.\n\nThat's what happened just over the course of a few decades. And all that progress is real. It has been broad, and it has been deep, and it all happened in what -- by the standards of human history -- was nothing more than a blink of an eye. And now an entire generation has grown up in a world that by most measures has gotten steadily freer and healthier and wealthier and less violent and more tolerant during the course of their lifetimes.\n\nIt should make us hopeful. But if we cannot deny the very real strides that our world has made since that moment when Madiba took those steps out of confinement, we also have to recognize all the ways that the international order has fallen short of its promise. In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful \u00e9lites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business.\n\nSo we have to start by admitting that whatever laws may have existed on the books, whatever wonderful pronouncements existed in constitutions, whatever nice words were spoken during these last several decades at international conferences or in the halls of the United Nations, the previous structures of privilege and power and injustice and exploitation never completely went away. They were never fully dislodged. Caste differences still impact the life chances of people on the Indian subcontinent. Ethnic and religious differences still determine who gets opportunity, from Central Europe to the Gulf. It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa. And it is also a fact that the accumulated disadvantages of years of institutionalized oppression have created yawning disparities in income, and in wealth, and in education, and in health, in personal safety, in access to credit. Women and girls around the world continue to be blocked from positions of power and authority. They continue to be prevented from getting a basic education. They are disproportionately victimized by violence and abuse. They're still paid less than men for doing the same work. That's still happening. Economic opportunity, for all the magnificence of the global economy, all the shining skyscrapers that have transformed the landscape around the world, entire neighborhoods, entire cities, entire regions, entire nations have been bypassed.\n\nIn other words, for far too many people, the more things have changed, the more things stayed the same.\n\nAnd while globalization and technology have opened up new opportunities and driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalization has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It's also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor's bargaining power. It's made it easier for capital to avoid tax laws and the regulations of nation-states -- can just move billions, trillions of dollars with a tap of a computer key.\n\nThe result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It's meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That's not an exaggeration; that's a statistic. Think about that. In many middle-income and developing countries, new wealth has just tracked the old bad deal that people got, because it reinforced or even compounded existing patterns of inequality; the only difference is it created even greater opportunities for corruption on an epic scale. And for once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don't have specialized skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms. In every country, just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries' political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored. Now, it should be noted that this new international \u00e9lite, the professional class that supports them, differs in important respects from the ruling aristocracies of old. It includes many who are self-made. It includes champions of meritocracy. And, although still mostly white and male, as a group they reflect a diversity of nationalities and ethnicities that would have not existed a hundred years ago. A decent percentage consider themselves liberal in their politics, modern and cosmopolitan in their outlook. Unburdened by parochialism, or nationalism, or overt racial prejudice or strong religious sentiment, they are equally comfortable in New York or London or Shanghai or Nairobi or Buenos Aires, or Johannesburg. Many are sincere and effective in their philanthropy. Some of them count Nelson Mandela among their heroes. Some even supported Barack Obama for the Presidency of the United States, and by virtue of my status as a former head of state, some of them consider me as an honorary member of the club. And I get invited to these fancy things, you know? They'll fly me out.\n\nBut what's nevertheless true is that, in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. Their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe, are often done without malice; it's just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.\n\nBut too often, these decisions are also made without reference to notions of human solidarity or a ground-level understanding of the consequences that will be felt by particular people in particular communities by the decisions that are made. And from their boardrooms or retreats, global decision-makers don't get a chance to see sometimes the pain in the faces of laid-off workers. Their kids don't suffer when cuts in public education and health care result as a consequence of a reduced tax base because of tax avoidance. They can't hear the resentment of an older tradesman when he complains that a newcomer doesn't speak his language on a job site where he once worked. They're less subject to the discomfort and the displacement that some of their countrymen may feel as globalization scrambles not only existing economic arrangements but traditional social and religious mores.\n\nWhich is why, at the end of the twentieth century, while some Western commentators were declaring the end of history and the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy and the virtues of the global supply chain, so many missed signs of a brewing backlash -- a backlash that arrived in so many forms. It announced itself most violently with 9/11 and the emergence of transnational terrorist networks, fuelled by an ideology that perverted one of the world's great religions and asserted a struggle not just between Islam and the West but between Islam and modernity. An ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq didn't help, accelerating a sectarian conflict.\n\nRussia, already humiliated by its reduced influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, feeling threatened by democratic movements along its borders, suddenly started reasserting authoritarian control and, in some cases, meddling with its neighbors. China, emboldened by its economic success, started bristling against criticism of its human-rights record; it framed the promotion of universal values as nothing more than foreign meddling, imperialism under a new name.\n\nWithin the United States, within the European Union, challenges to globalization first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right, as you started seeing populist movements -- which, by the way, are often cynically funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing government constraints on their business interests. These movements tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores, fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn't look like them or sound like them or pray as they did.\n\nAnd, perhaps more than anything else, the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in which the reckless behavior of financial \u00e9lites resulted in years of hardship for ordinary people all around the world, made all the previous assurances of experts ring hollow -- all those assurances that somehow financial regulators knew what they were doing, that somebody was minding the store, that global economic integration was an unadulterated good. Because of the actions taken by governments during and after that crisis -- including, I should add, by aggressive steps by my Administration -- the global economy has now returned to healthy growth. But the credibility of the international system, the faith in experts in places like Washington or Brussels, all that had taken a blow.\n\nA politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear, and that kind of politics is now on the move. It's on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist. I am simply stating the facts. Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained -- the form of it -- but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning.\n\nIn the West, you've got far-right parties that oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. Many developing countries now are looking at China's model of authoritarian control, combined with mercantilist capitalism, as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech, as long as the economy is going good? The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media -- once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity -- has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nSo on Madiba's one-hundredth birthday, we now stand at a crossroads, a moment in time when two very different visions of humanity's future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories. Two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond?\n\nShould we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba's release from prison, from the Berlin Wall coming down -- should we see that hope that we had as na\u00efve and misguided? Should we understand the last twenty-five years of global integration as nothing more than a detour from the previous inevitable cycle of history? Where might makes right, and politics is a hostile competition between tribes and races and religions, and nations compete in a zero-sum game, constantly teetering on the edge of conflict until full-blown war breaks out? Is that what we think?\n\nLet me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision. I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King and Abraham Lincoln. I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multiracial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they're endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible, and that it can achieve more peace and more co\u00f6peration in pursuit of a common good. That's what I believe.\n\nAnd I believe we have no choice but to move forward, that those of us who believe in democracy and civil rights and a common humanity have a better story to tell. And I believe this not just based on sentiment. I believe it based on hard evidence: The fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies, the ones with the highest living standards and the highest levels of satisfaction among their people, happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal, progressive ideal that we talk about and have nurtured the talents and contributions of all their citizens.\n\nThe fact that authoritarian governments have been shown, time and time again, to breed corruption, because they're not accountable; to repress their people; to lose touch eventually with reality; to engage in bigger and bigger lies that ultimately result in economic and political and cultural and scientific stagnation. Look at history. Look at the facts.\n\nThe fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial, or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together -- eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books. The fact that technology cannot be put back in a bottle, so we're stuck with the fact that we now live close together and populations are going to be moving, and environmental challenges are not going to go away on their own, so that the only way to effectively address problems like climate change or mass migration or pandemic disease will be to develop systems for more international co\u00f6peration, not less.\n\nWe have a better story to tell. But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men. History shows how easily people can be convinced to turn on those who look different, or worship God in a different way. So if we're truly to continue Madiba's long walk towards freedom, we're going to have to work harder, and we're going to have to be smarter. We're going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past. And so, in the brief time remaining, let me just suggest a few guideposts for the road ahead, guideposts that draw from Madiba's work, his words, the lessons of his life.\n\nFirst, Madiba shows those of us who believe in freedom and democracy we are going to have to fight harder to reduce inequality and promote lasting economic opportunity for all people.\n\nNow, I don't believe in economic determinism. Human beings don't live on bread alone. But they need bread. And history shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly, and that once people achieve more than mere subsistence, then they're measuring their well-being by how they compare to their neighbors, and whether their children can expect to live a better life. When economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow. That dynamic eats away at democracy. Sometimes it may be straight-out corruption, but sometimes it may not involve the exchange of money; it's just folks who are that wealthy get what they want, and it undermines human freedom.\n\nMadiba understood this. This is not new. He warned us about this. He said, \"Where globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and the powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and the weaker, [then] we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.\" That's what he said. So if we are serious about universal freedom today, if we care about social justice today, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. And I would respectfully amend what Madiba said. I don't do it often, but I'd say it's not enough for us to protest; we're going to have to build, we're going to have to innovate, we're going to have to figure out how do we close this widening chasm of wealth and opportunity, both within countries and between them.\n\nHow we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new President is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so. But we can learn from the last seventy years that it will not involve unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism. It also won't involve old-style command-and-control socialism form the top. That was tried. It didn't work very well.\n\nFor almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive, market-based system, one that offers education for every child, that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker, that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses, and has laws that root out corruption and insures fair dealing in business, that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich, but they're giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.\n\nI should add, by the way, right now I'm actually surprised by how much money I got, and let me tell you something: I don't have half as much as most of these folks, or a tenth or a hundredth. There's only so much you can eat. There's only so big a house you can have. There's only so many nice trips you can take. I mean ... it's enough! You don't have to take a vow of poverty just to say, \"Well, let me help out. Let me look at that child out there who doesn't have enough to eat or needs some school fees. Let me help him out. I'll pay a little more in taxes. It's O.K. I can afford it.\" I mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more.\n\nIt involves promoting an inclusive capitalism, both within nations and between nations. As we pursue, for example, the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to get past the charity mindset. We've got to bring more resources to the forgotten pockets of the world through investment and entrepreneurship, because there is talent everywhere in the world if given an opportunity.\n\nWhen it comes to the international system of commerce and trade, it's legitimate for poorer countries to continue to seek access to wealthier markets. . . . It's also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries, to make sure that they're providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers.\n\nBut even as there are discussions to be had around trade and commerce, it's important to recognize this reality: while the outsourcing of jobs from north to south, from east to west, while a lot of that was a dominant trend in the late twentieth century, the biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology. The biggest challenge for your new President, when we think about how we're going to employ more people here, is going to be also technology, because artificial intelligence is here, and it is accelerating, and you're going to have driverless cars, and you're going to have more and more automated services, and that's going to make the job of giving everybody work that is meaningful tougher, and we're going to have to be more imaginative. The pace of change is going to require us to do more fundamental reimagining of our social and political arrangements, to protect the economic security and the dignity that comes with a job. It's not just money that a job provides; it provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose. So we're going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review our work week and how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. We're going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track.\n\nSecond, Madiba teaches us that some principles really are universal, and the most important one is the principle that we are bound together by a common humanity, and that each individual has inherent dignity and worth.\n\nIt's surprising that we have to affirm this truth today. More than a quarter century after Madiba walked out of prison, I still have to stand here at a lecture and devote some time to saying that black people and white people and Asian people and Latin American people and women and men and gays and straights, that we are all human, that our differences are superficial, and that we should treat each other with care and respect. I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well established. But it turns out, as we're seeing in this recent drift into reactionary politics, that the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished. So we've got to constantly be on the lookout, and fight for people who seek to elevate themselves by putting somebody else down. We have to resist the notion that basic human rights like freedom to dissent, or the right of women to fully participate in the society, or the right of minorities to equal treatment, or the rights of people not to be beat up and jailed because of their sexual orientation -- we have to be careful not to say that somehow, well, that doesn't apply to us, that those are Western ideas rather than universal imperatives.\n\nAgain, Madiba anticipated things. He knew what he was talking about. In 1964, before he received the sentence that condemned him to die in prison, he explained from the dock that \"the Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.\" In other words, he didn't say, Well, those books weren't written by South Africans, so I can't claim them. No, he said, That's part of my inheritance. That's part of the human inheritance. That applies here, in this country, to me, and to you. That's part of what gave him the moral authority that the apartheid regime could never claim. He was more familiar with their best values than they were. He had read their documents more carefully than they had. And he went on to say, \"Political division based on color is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one color group by another.\" That's Nelson Mandela speaking in 1964, when I was three years old.\n\nWhat was true then remains true today. Basic truths do not change. It is a truth that can be embraced by the English, and by the Indian, and by the Mexican and by the Bantu and by the Luo and by the American. It is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion -- that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. That we see ourselves in other people. That we can recognize common hopes and common dreams. And it is a truth that is incompatible with any form of discrimination based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation. And it is a truth that, by the way, when embraced, actually delivers practical benefits, since it insures that a society can draw upon the talents and energy and skill of all its people. And, if you doubt that, just ask the French football team that just won the World Cup. Because not all of those folks look like Gauls to me. But they're French. They're French.\n\nEmbracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities. Madiba never stopped being proud of his tribal heritage. He didn't stop being proud of being a black man and being a South African. But he believed, as I believe, that you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that you're a little insecure about your heritage if you've got to put somebody else's heritage down. Don't you get a sense sometimes that these people who are so intent on putting people down and puffing themselves up, that they're small-hearted, that there's something they're just afraid of? Madiba knew that we cannot claim justice for ourselves when it's only reserved for some. Madiba understood that we can't say we've got a just society simply because we replaced the color of the person on top of an unjust system, so the person looks like us even though they're doing the same stuff, and somehow now we've got justice. That doesn't work. It's not justice if now you're on top, so I'm going to do the same thing that those folks were doing to me, and now I'm going to do it to you. That's not justice. \"I detest racialism,\" he said, \"whether it comes from a black man or a white man.\"\n\nNow, we have to acknowledge that there is disorientation that comes from rapid change and modernization, and the fact that the world has shrunk, and we're going to have to find ways to lessen the fears of those who feel threatened. In the West's current debate around immigration, for example, it's not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you're a citizen or not is going to matter to a government; that laws need to be followed; that, in the public realm, newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home. Those are legitimate things, and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly. But that can't be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion. There's got to be some consistency. We can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognize that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child.\n\nThird, Madiba reminds us that democracy is about more than just elections. When he was freed from prison, Madiba's popularity -- well, you couldn't even measure it. He could have been President for life. Am I wrong? Who was going to run against him? Had he chosen to do so, Madiba could have governed by executive fiat, unconstrained by check and balances. But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom. No individual -- not Mandela, not Obama -- are entirely immune to the corrupting influences of absolute power, if you can do whatever you want and everyone's too afraid to tell you when you're making a mistake. No one is immune from the dangers of that.\n\nMandela understood this. He said, \"Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours, where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.\" He understood it's not just about who has the most votes. It's also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work.\n\nWe have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets ninety per cent of the vote, because all the opposition is locked up or can't get on TV, is a democracy. Democracy depends on strong institutions, and it's about minority rights and checks and balances, and freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press, and the right to protest and petition the government, and an independent judiciary, and everybody having to follow the law.\n\nAnd, yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. But the efficiency that's offered by an autocrat, that's a false promise. . . . It leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual, and not the other way around. And it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real.\n\nSo for those of us who are interested in strengthening democracy, it's time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world's capitals and the centers of power, and to start focussing more on the grassroots, because that's where democratic legitimacy comes from. Not from the top down, not from abstract theories, not just from experts, but from the bottom up. Knowing the lives of those who are struggling.\n\nAs a community organizer, I learned as much from a laid-off steelworker in Chicago or a single mom in a poor neighborhood that I visited as I learned from the finest economists in the Oval Office. Democracy means being in touch and in tune with life as it's lived in our communities, and that's what we should expect from our leaders, and it depends upon cultivating leaders at the grassroots who can help bring about change and implement it on the ground and can tell leaders in fancy buildings this isn't working down here.\n\nTo make democracy work, Madiba shows us that we also have to keep teaching our children, and ourselves, to engage with people not only who look different but who hold different views. This is hard.\n\nMost of us prefer to surround ourselves with opinions that validate what we already believe. You notice the people who you think are smart are the people who agree with you. Funny how that works. But democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you -- because they're white, or because they're male -- that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters.\n\nMadiba lived this complexity. In prison, he studied Afrikaans so that he could better understand the people who were jailing him. And when he got out of prison he extended a hand to those who had jailed him, because he knew that they had to be a part of the democratic South Africa that he wanted to build. \"To make peace with an enemy,\" he wrote, \"one must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one's partner.\"\n\nSo those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether it's on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable. You can't expect to get a hundred per cent of what you want all the time; sometimes you have to compromise. That doesn't mean abandoning your principles, but instead it means holding on to those principles and then having the confidence that they're going to stand up to a serious democratic debate. That's how America's founders intended our system to work: that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and proof it would be possible to arrive at a basis for common ground.\n\nI should add: for this to work, we have to actually believe in an objective reality. This is another one of these things that I didn't have to lecture about. You have to believe in facts. Without facts, there is no basis for co\u00f6peration. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it's going to be hard for us to co\u00f6perate. I can find common ground for those who oppose the Paris Accords because, for example, they might say, Well, it's not going to work; you can't get everybody to co\u00f6perate. Or they might say it's more important for us to provide cheap energy for the poor, even if it means in the short term that there's more pollution. At least I can have a debate with them about that, and I can show them why I think clean energy is the better path, especially for poor countries, that you can leapfrog old technologies. I can't find common ground if somebody says climate change is just not happening, when almost all of the world's scientists tell us it is. I don't know where to start talking to you about this. If you start saying it's an elaborate hoax, where do we start?\n\nUnfortunately, too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. We see it in state-sponsored propaganda. We see it in Internet-driven fabrications. We see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment. We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders, where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be, if you caught them lying, they'd be, like, \"Oh, man.\" Now they just keep on lying. . . .\n\nI don't think of myself as a great leader just because I don't completely make stuff up. You'd think that was a baseline. Anyway, we see it in the promotion of anti-intellectualism and the rejection of science from leaders who find critical thinking and data somehow politically inconvenient. And, as with the denial of rights, the denial of facts runs counter to democracy. It could be its undoing, which is why we must zealously protect independent media. We have to guard against the tendency for social media to become purely a platform for spectacle, outrage, or disinformation. We have to insist that our schools teach critical thinking to our young people, not just blind obedience.\n\nWhich, I'm sure you are thankful for, leads to my final point: we have to follow Madiba's example of persistence and of hope. It is tempting to give in to cynicism: to believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back, that the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the nineties, now you are hearing people talk about the end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strongman. We have to resist that cynicism. Because we've been through darker times; we've been in lower valleys and deeper valleys.\n\nYes, by the end of his life, Madiba embodied the successful struggle for human rights, but the journey was not easy. It wasn't pre-ordained. The man went to prison for almost three decades. He split limestone in the heat, he slept in a small cell, and was repeatedly put in solitary confinement. I remember talking to some of his former colleagues saying how they hadn't realized, when they were released, just the sight of a child, the idea of holding a child, they had missed -- it wasn't something available to them, for decades.\n\nAnd yet his power actually grew during those years -- and the power of his jailers diminished, because he knew that, if you stick to what's true, if you know what's in your heart, and you're willing to sacrifice for it, even in the face of overwhelming odds, that it might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen in the next week, it might not even happen in your lifetime. Things may go backwards for a while, but, ultimately, right makes might, not the other way around. Ultimately, the better story can win out, and, as strong as Madiba's spirit may have been, he would not have sustained that hope had he been alone in the struggle. Part of what buoyed him up was that he knew that, each year, the ranks of freedom fighters were replenishing, young men and women, here in South African, in the A.N.C. and beyond, black and Indian and white, from across the countryside, across the continent, around the world, who in those most difficult days would keep working on behalf of his vision. And that's what we need right now. We don't just need one leader; we don't just need one inspiration. What we badly need right now is that collective spirit. And I know that those young people, those hope carriers, are gathering around the world. Because history shows that, whenever progress is threatened, and the things we care about most are in question, we should heed the words of Robert Kennedy -- spoken here in South Africa -- he said, \"Our answer is the world's hope: it is to rely on youth. It's to rely on the spirit of the young.\"\n\nSo, young people who are in the audience, who are listening, my message to you is simple: keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world. Mandela said, \"Young people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom.\" Now is a good time to be aroused. Now is a good time to be fired up. And, for those of us who care about the legacy that we honor here today -- about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body -- we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my foundation is convening over the last few days two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities, who reflect Madiba's values, who are poised to lead the way.\n\nPeople like Abaas Mpindi, a journalist from Uganda, who founded the Media Challenge Initiative to help other young people get the training they need to tell the stories that the world needs to know.\n\nPeople like Caren Wakoli, an entrepreneur from Kenya who founded the Emerging Leaders Foundation to get young people involved in the work of fighting poverty and promoting human dignity.\n\nPeople like Enock Nkulanga, who directs the African Children's Mission, which helps children in Uganda and Kenya get the education that they need and then, in his spare time, Enock advocates for the rights of children around the globe, and founded an organization called LeadMinds Africa, which does exactly what it says.\n\nYou meet these people, you talk to them, they will give you hope. They are taking the baton; they know they can't just rest on the accomplishments of the past, even the accomplishments of those as momentous as Nelson Mandela's. They stand on the shoulders of those who came before, including that young black boy born a hundred years ago, but they know that it is now their turn to do the work.\n\nMadiba reminds us, \"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and, if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.\" Love comes more naturally to the human heart; let's remember that truth. Let's see it as our North Star, let's be joyful in our struggle to make that truth manifest here on Earth, so that, in a hundred years from now, future generations will look back and say, \"They kept the march going. That's why we live under new banners of freedom.\" Thank you very much, South Africa. Thank you.", "It was more bad news for NBC on Monday, as Olympian Mikaela Shiffrin announced that she was pulling of out the downhill race on Wednesday in an effort to focus on alpine combined event the following day.\n\nThat decision came after organizers moved the combined from Friday to Thursday in order to avoid high winds, and following Shiffrin's disappointing fourth-place finish in the slalom last week.\n\nThe golden girl of skiing, who was chasing five Gold medals at these Games, has now pulled out of two events, causing problems for NBC and its prime time coverage which has been lacking in both household names and medal winners.\n\nNBC is also without its two most veteran anchors, Matt Lauer and Bob Costas, and an attempt to bring on beloved figure skater Adam Rippon as a correspondent for the second week of coverage feel apart when the Olympian rejected the network's offer.\n\nHold on tight: The 2018 Winter Olympics have produced few medal winners from Team USA and provided little must-see TV for broadcaster NBC (Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie and Adam Rippon on Monday above)\n\nPuke: On Monday, NBC learned that Mikaela Shiffrin (above after throwing up last Thursday) was withdrawing from downhill and figure skater Adam Rippon turned down a correspondent offer. Shiffrin's lone gold was won outside of primetime due to weather delays\n\nIce, ice baby: This comes after Shiffrin placed fourth in the slalom last week just minutes before figure skater Nathan Chen fell during his disastrous short program (above)\n\n'I am flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent for them here in PyeongChang. Doing this would require me to leave Team USA and move out of the Olympic Village. I don't want to do that so I had to declined the opportunity,' wrote Rippon on Twitter.\n\n'I love being on Team USA and representing our country. My teammates were there for me during my events, and now I NEED to be there for them. I look forward to being with them, and I'm very excited for the rest of the competition. Go Team USA!!!'\n\nRippon did however spend most of Monday morning with the Today crew, providing some much needed entertainment as there were just two medal winners over the weekend.\n\nJohn-Henry Krueger picked up Silver in the 1000 meter short-track speed-skating race on Saturday while on Sunday Nick Goepper grabbed Silver in the men's ski slopestyle.\n\nAt the 2014 Games, the United States claimed all three spots on the podium in the slopestyle event, but on Sunday defending silver-medalist Gus Kenworthy finished in fifth while McRae Williams was down in tenth.\n\nNo night was more disastrous however than Thursday, when two Americans who were expected to medal spectacularly collapsed within minutes of one another.\n\nFirst up was Shiffrin, who finished off the podium in the slalom, her strongest event.\n\nNBC did manage to get some play out of the 23-year-old skier's slope-side spewing moments before the race, and her stunned reaction once the results were in for the event.\n\nShortly after that came Nathan Chen's disappointing performance in the men's figure skating short program.\n\nChen, who was the face of NBC's Olympics coverage alongside Lindsay Vonn and Shaun White in the lead-up to the Games, fell during his skate and landed in 17th place going into the second night of competition.\n\nHe did manage to deliver an incredible long program and land a record-breaking six quad humps in his free program to rebound to fifth place - but that still left all three Americans off the podium.\n\nThat performance happened early in the competition however due to his ranking, leaving Rippon as the featured skater of the night from Team USA.\n\nRippon was by far the most artistic skater of the evening, but his program had no quads meaning he stood no shot of getting a medal unless the field fell apart.\n\nHe took the top spot when it came to interviews though, particularly his exchanges with Andrea Joyce, who he has taken to calling 'Angie.'\n\nLuger: NBC is also without its two veteran anchors this year, Matt Lauer on Today and Bob Costas of NBC Sports (Roker and Lauer above in 2014)\n\nSteam queens: This means Al Roker has been paired with Craig Melvin (above) for segments in South Korea that lack the chemistry and comfort Roker shared with Lauer\n\nThree's company: Megyn Kelly is in New York, but has largely spent the first half of her show covering the Olympics while being joined in by the hosts of American Ninja Warrior, Matt Iseman (left) and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila (right). American Olympians did so poorly Sunday night that much of Monday's Olympic segment was spent chatting about their own career paths\n\nA week into the Winter Olympics, the United States has won only 10 medals, leaving little of interest to watch some nights and causing ratings to sink from the previous Olympics.\n\nOf those 10 half have been gold, with Shiffrin picking up one in giant slalom and three snowboarders scoring first place finished for Team USA: Jamie Anderson and 17-year-old superstars Red Gerard and Chloe Kim.\n\nGerard and Kim were the focus of much attention after their wins last week, with the two relative unknowns prior to their victories.\n\nNBC quickly capitalized on Kim's with interviews and increased prominence in their marketing and advertising material, whereas Chen seemed to disappear from those spots after his finish off the podium.\n\nShiffrin meanwhile won her Gold well after midnight due to a scheduling issue, a time when most Americans were already in bed on the East Coast.\n\nShe is also a remarkably focused competitor, and thus less inclined to give the lengthy interviews with medal winners that NBC depends on during the Games.\n\nWhite won the fifth medal, but that victory quickly proved to be a headache when he downplayed allegations of sexual harassment made by a woman back in 2016 at his post-event press conference.\n\nHe went so far as to call her complaint, which was settled outside court, 'gossip' at the presser, where no females were called on to ask questions.\n\nThe following morning her appeared on Today to apologize for his remarks but then disappeared from NBC's coverage.\n\nAt the start of week two, Vonn, Shiffrin, and the US men's and women's hockey teams are among the hopefuls expected to medal in their events.\n\nVonn failed to medal in her first event- much like nearly every speed skater has failed to medal.\n\nThe problems are not just on the slopes or in the rink either, with Today notably trying to find a groove without Lauer while NBC Sports broadcasts its first Costas-free Winter Games.\n\nLauer and Al Roker had great on-air chemistry at the Games, and provided viewers with some must-see TV moments, like when they luged together down the Olympic track in Spandex.\n\nTheir gimmicks also provided the network with great viral moments, which have been sorely lacking this games.\n\nMother may I?: Lester Holt with Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen in South Korea\n\nTeens: Gold-medal winners Red Gerad (left) and Chloe Kim (right) in snowboarding\n\nGossip girl: Shaun White's (above last week) victory was tarnished by comments he made about sexual harassment allegations he faced last year\n\nRoker has now been paired with Craig Melvin, with whom he checked out a South Korean spa or jimjilbang last week in a underwhelming segment for the morning show.\n\nOn Monday the two were back at it again, visiting American troops in South Korea.\n\nThat segment, while deeply heartwarming, will likely not be the viral sensation of the Roker-Lauer luge run.\n\nIt was at the last Winter Olympics that Lauer allegedly carried on a relationship with a young staffer that led to his termination.\n\nMike Tirico has taken over for Costas, and while a seasoned pro has yet to establish himself the way Costas did, with many tuning in just to see the veteran sportscaster.\n\nHe even managed to turn coming down with pink eye into a viral moment in 2014 at Sochi.\n\nMEMORIES: This Olympics has had almost no viral or talked about moments. But four years ago Bob Costas managed to get buzz even for his pink eye\n\nThe delegation sent by President Trump did NBC no favors either, with Vice President Mike Pence saying little and his wife Karen saying nothing in their brief interviews with NBC after attending the Opening Ceremony.\n\nThis was not the case in 2014, with President Obama helping to fuel ratings when he declared that openly-gay and media-friendly athletes Brian Boitano, Billie Jean King and Caitlin Cahow would represent the US, among others, in light of Russia's human rights violations .\n\nThat drama, along with concern that the Olympic Village and venues might not even be complete in time for completion, also helped to heighten interest and drive tune-in among viewers.\n\nAnd lastly, the news cycle is wreaking havoc on NBC.\n\nA majority of their Nightly News and Today staff are in South Korea, which has left less people back in New York to cover breaking news.\n\nIn the past week that has included the Florida school shooting and Mueller indictment as well as Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's split.\n\nThe news cycle is also wreaking Havoc. Lester Holt was anchoring nights about the worst school shooting since Sandy Hook with the backdrop of ski slopes - and vast amounts of NBC staff are in Korea along with almost every anchor\n\nMegyn Kelly is in New York, but has largely spent the first half of her show covering the Olympics while being joined in by the hosts of American Ninja Warrior, Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila, in an awkward cross-promotional coupling.\n\nShe did skip covering the Games last Thursday, in the wake of the shooting, and on Monday, with Americans performing so poorly in PyeongChang over the weekend, the threesome instead spent the Olympic segment revisiting the career paths of Iseman and Gbaja-Biamila.\n\nGuthrie also managed to score a major interview for Today last week when she went to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea to discuss the path to freedom taken by solider Oh Chong Song, who barely escaped the totalitarian regime with his life last year.\n\nToday has managed to stay ahead of Good Morning America and CBS This Morning, but by no great margins.\n\nNBC is still managing to clobber the competition with its primetime coverage, as most networks air repeats, but television ratings are down double digits from the Sochi Games most nights.\n\nThe Olympics have been a guaranteed ratings winner for NBC ever since 1988, the year the network acquired the rights to broadcast the Summer Games.\n\nIn 2002, the network picked up the rights to the Winter Games, and in 2011 paid a record $4.38 billion to the International Olympic Committee to broadcast through 2020, the most expensive television contract in history.\n\nOn Saturday, NBC only managed to pull in 13.62 million viewers for a 3.2/13 ratings and share, the lowest primetime numbers yet for these Games.\n\nThat is just over a tenth of the 126.5 million viewers who tuned in on a Wednesday night back in 1994 to watch the ladies short program featuring Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan."]}}
