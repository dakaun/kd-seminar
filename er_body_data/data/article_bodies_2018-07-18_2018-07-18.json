{"Samsung": {"2018-07-18": ["BRUSSELS -- European regulators came down hard on another U.S. tech giant Wednesday, fining Google a record $5 billion for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine, the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted .\n\nGoogle has 90 days to put remedies in place regardless of its appeal -- which could involve unbundling key apps and allowing Android handset manufacturers to sell devices using altered versions of Android.\n\nMozilla Foundation, the non-profit group that creates the lightweight ad-blocking browser Firefox Focus, said the ruling gives it the opportunity to displace Chrome as the default browser in some phones. It has been in talks with manufacturers from Huawei to Samsung about that.\n\nThe ruling creates \"a huge opportunity,\" Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief operating officer, said Wednesday.\n\nIt's also possible not much will change. Google Search, Chrome and the Play Store are popular with consumers and developers. Handset manufacturers could choose them despite unbundling.\n\n\"It's possible phone manufacturers won't actually take advantage of the newfound freedom they have,\" said Thomas Vinje, lead lawyer for FairSearch, the Brussels-based lobbying group backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and others that was the main complainant in the case. \"It at least opens up the possibility.\"\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe ruling could stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand. Still, some U.S. politicians welcomed it.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and should lead U.S. enforcers to protect consumers. Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nRegardless of the pending appeal, failure to come up with remedies to rectify the behavior after 90 days risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nNeither fine will cripple the company. Google parent Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is technically an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS by a wide margin.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nBoth Amazon and Samsung, maker of the popular Galaxy line of phones, declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nGoogle argues that downloads are easy and while the inclusion of its suite of apps help phones run well out of the box, competitors' apps are a tap away.\n\nIt also argues that not supporting so-called \"forked\" versions of Android ensures a baseline of experience across some 24,000 different models of Android device. Vestager called the compatibility argument a \"smokescreen.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the U.S. presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.\n\n___\n\nNakashima reported from Menlo Park, California.

That's no surprise. After all, Chrome OS is a Linux variant. But, doing it by using either Crouton in a chroot container or Gallium OS, a Xubuntu Chromebook-specific Linux variant, wasn't easy. Then, Google announced it was bringing a completely integrated Linux desktop to the Chromebook.\n\nToday, with a properly-equipped Chromebook and the bravery to run canary code, you can run Debian Linux on your Chromebook. Here's how to do it.\n\nThis new Chromebook Linux feature is Crostini, the umbrella technology for getting Linux running with Chrome OS. Crostini gets enough Linux running to run KVM, Linux's built-in virtual machine (VM). On top of this, Crostini starts and runs LXC containers. You won't see it, unless you look closely, but it's in those containers that your Debian Linux instances are running.\n\nEventually, anyone with a newer Chromebook will be able to run Linux. Specifically, if your Chromebook's operating system is based on the Linux 4.4 kernel, you'll be supported. But we're not there yet. It's also possible that older Chromebooks, running Linux 4.14, will be retrofitted with Crostini support.\n\nOfficially, you need a Pixelbook, Google's top-of-the-line Chromebook, to run Linux. But, users have found a dozen other models can run Crostini with half-a-dozen others expected to be supported soon. Chromebooks that can already use Crostini include newer Intel-powered Chromebooks from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung. Dell models will start getting supported later this year.\n\nI used my best-of-breed Pixelbook with its 1.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor, 512GB SSD, with 16GBs of RAM for my tests. This is the fastest Chromebook on the market. It's not cheap, at a list price of $1,399, but it's worth it if you want to push Linux on the Chromebook's limits.\n\nOnce you have the hardware you need, you must switch your Chromebook from the stable update channel to the dev channel. This is alpha software and it updates about once a week. Let me make this absolutely clear: This is not stable software. It will blow up at times. But, faint heart never won fair technology discoveries.\n\nThis is a bigger decision than it looks at first. You'll lose all your local data if you try to go back to the stable, or even beta, channels. With a Chromebook that's not much of a problem since most of your data and settings are kept on the Google Cloud, it's still worth keeping in mind.\n\nIf you want to wait and be safe, Crostini support is expected to enter the stable channel with Chrome OS 69 in mid-September.\n\nTo make the switch to dev, take the following steps:\n\nOnce that's done, if you're not using a Pixelbook you may need to set a Chrome flag to access Linux. You do this by entering: chrome://flags on the Chrome browser's address line. This command displays all of Chrome's experimental features. Scroll down the list until you find:\n\n#enable-experimental-crostini-ui\n\nActivate this, and your system may be ready to go. I say \"may\" because to run Crostini your Chromebook must not only be on the dev channel, but Google must also have enabled the Linux VM for your hardware.\n\nThe easiest way to confirm that a particular Chromebook works with Linux is to follow the above steps and then open Chrome OS's built-in shell, crosh, and run the shell command:\n\nvmc start termina\n\nIf you get a message such as \"ERROR: command 'vmc' is not available\", you're out of luck. But, if you see a terminal, congrats, you've just found a new Chromebook that's Linux-ready.\n\nNext, head to Chrome OS settings (chrome://settings), scroll down to to \"Linux (Beta)\" and activate it.\n\nNow, open the app switcher by pressing the Search/Launcher key and type \"Terminal\". This launches the Termina VM, which will start running a Debian 9.0 Stretch Linux container.\n\nCongratulations! You're now running Debian Linux on your Chromebook.\n\nFrom here you can install and run programs using Debian's normal software commands. For example, to update my new Linux system and install the lynx web browser, I'd run:\n\nWhile you could install pretty much any program on your new Linux instance, I gave a shell-based program example because accelerated graphics and audio aren't working yet. So, while you could install Cinnamon, my favorite Linux interface, or Steam for games, it's not fast enough even on a maxed out Pixelbook to be that enjoyable. Not yet anyway.\n\nIn addition, many graphics-based programs, such as the photo-editor Gimp, won't run yet on Crostini. Give it time to mature before trying to get too fancy with heavy graphics software.\n\nSoon, though, Linux and Chrome will be a matched pair. Come that day, I see high-end Chromebooks becoming the laptops of choice for developers.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to do more with Linux and Chromebook, check out the excellent Reddit Crostini Wiki. For up-to-the-minute hands-on information about Crostini, its parent Reddit forum is the best resource on the web.", "Groupon GRPN made headlines Tuesday after IBM announced a $167 million lawsuit for violation of four of its e-commerce IPs. The tech giant claims that while Amazon AMZN, Facebook FB, and Google GOOGL each pay between $20 million and $50 million for use of these technologies, Groupon has been using them without permission.\n\nShares of Groupon did not see significant movement on Tuesday and Wednesday as investors were unshaken by the latest in a series of back-and-forth exchanges between the two firms. IBM sued Groupon for the first time in 2016, alleging that it infringed on two server load-reducing systems as well as \"single sign-on\" technology, which allows consumers to use accounts from platforms such as Facebook FB or Google to sign in to their Groupon account.\n\nIs IBM Just a Patent Bully?\n\nIBM has won the most US patents in each of the last 25 years, receiving an astounding 9,043 last year alone, according to Bloomberg. The next closest company was Samsung, which received over 3,000 fewer patents in the same period. Groupon lawyer David Hadden told Bloomberg that these patents have fueled \"a business that it [IBM] doesn't talk about in its TV commercials.\" And he might be onto something.\n\nIn its most recent annual report, IBM highlighted intellectual property as a key value driver, alongside R&D and global markets. In 2017, Big Blue earned nearly $1.47 billion in income related to intellectual property. It also explained that a decline in IP income contributed to an overall decrease in annual revenue.\n\nIBM not only holds a large number of patents but is also not afraid to litigate over them. In recent years, it has sued or collected patent-related fees from Expedia EXPE, Twitter TWTR, Priceline -- which is now part of Booking Holdings BKNG -- and many others.\n\nIBM's argument is basically the reason there is patent law. However, it also has a track record of filing a patent for everything it possibly can.\n\nThe company came under fire last January when it was granted a patent for an \"out-of-office email system,\" as crazy as it sounds. IBM ultimately caved to the outrage and dedicated the patent to the public, agreeing not to enforce it.\n\nIt is difficult to comment on the nuts and bolts of the specific patents in question in the Groupon suit. However, past behavior reflects the very likely possibility that IBM is simply looking for new avenues for the monetization of its monstrously large patent portfolio.\n\nGroupon's Health\n\nNews broke earlier this month that Groupon is currently on the block and looking for a buyout offer. Management may see this as the best way out given that its shares are down nearly 82% since its November 2011 IPO.\n\nProfitability is a big issue for Groupon, which has seen sideways income movement in the last few years, as we can see below:\n\nWhile management has been working toward improving figures and cutting losses, the company is not earning much money. Still, it is leveraging new partnerships, including one with Universal Orlando.\n\nGroupon's key initiative is its transition from a deals company to a marketplace firm. It has also cut down its international exposure from 47 to 15 countries, and now focuses on three main areas: marketing, international, and shopping.\n\nThe company beat earnings and revenues estimates last quarter, but saw year-over-year setbacks. Yet, the firm raised its full-year 2018 guidance, and now expects adjusted EBITDA of $280-$290 million compared to the previous projection of $260-$270 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCould This Hinder a Potential Groupon Acquisition?\n\nTheoretically, a firm caught in extended litigation may not seem like an inherently attractive buyout target. But given the prolonged battle with IBM, and past trends, the market doesn't seem to mind. In fact, Groupon ticked up 1.7% to $4.72 per share by the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\nWhen IBM decided to sue Expedia earlier this year, it was targeting both it and Orbitz, which Expedia acquired in 2014. Big Blue claimed that it had first reached out to Orbitz regarding patent issues in 2011, but was unable to negotiate. Worth noting is that Expedia knew about the situation before deciding to complete the acquisition, meaning that it too did not see it as a big enough threat .\n\nGroupon appears to be poised in a similar position. Some of the patents that IBM is claiming are being violated date back to the early days of the internet, and are the same patents that it has used in previous arguments. Both firms will likely continue to duke it out in court for a few more years before ultimately settling on a much more reasonable figure than the initial $167 million.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIBM, like other former tech giants, is in a fight to catch up with the times. In the face of declining revenues, the firm needs as many sources of income as possible.\n\nGroupon, on the other hand, must also tackle its own challenges. Solid recent performance has led to positive earnings estimate revisions for the following quarter, current fiscal year, and following fiscal year. This leaves Groupon sitting at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). But while the firm's new strategic shift and growth initiatives are steps in the right direction, it will take some time before we can determine if they will pay off.\n\nInvestors should continue to monitor Groupon's efforts to boost profitability and any IBM updates because there is still plenty of space for optimism, and some potentially interesting plays to be made over the next few months.\n\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\n\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

A new leak has revealed that Samsung is also preparing to launch the 2018 version of the Galaxy Tab A 8.0.\n\nA press render for the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018) was published by the Dutch website Nieuwe Mobiel. The upcoming Samsung Android tablet is the successor to last year's model. The 2018 model appears to be smaller than its predecessor, but the size of the display itself, 8 inches, has remained unchanged. Samsung gave the 2018 model a slight redesign by simply slimming down the top and bottom bezels. This makes the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018) 7.5 millimeters shorter than the 2017 model.\n\nAnother design change on the 2018 model is the removal of the physical home button and the capacitive keys up front. The Samsung logo is now branded on the device's back instead of being emblazoned on the top bezel. This is also a design that's similar to the flagship Galaxy Tab S4. This seems to be part of Samsung's product strategy to make sure all of its tablets adhere to the same design language. It's also consistent with Samsung's desire to use on-screen navigation keys for its Android devices.\n\nThe render for the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018) also appears to show that it's covered in a 2.5D glass to give it a more premium look, as pointed out by SamMobile. The image also appears to show that the tablet may have slightly curved edges. However, it's possible that this may simply be an optical illusion and the front glass panel is really just flat.\n\nAs for the specs of the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018), there's currently no new information leaked by the Dutch website. However, a previous benchmark listing from earlier this month hinted that the tablet may arrive with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor with 2GB of RAM, according to Phone Arena. It's likely that the tablet will arrive with 32GB of storage and will run Android 8.1 Oreo straight out of the box.\n\nSamsung hasn't revealed any of its plans for its Android tablets, but the leaked render displays the \"Aug. 9\" date on the tablet's screen. That is the same date when Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy Note 9 and the Galaxy Watch. It's possible that this tablet will be announced at the same event, alongside the Galaxy Tab S4 and the Galaxy Tab A2.\n\nSamsung might announce the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018) soon. Photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji", "I am easily a foot taller than Andy Grove. But whenever I was with him, I felt that he was the giant.\n\nThat's what the bestselling Harvard business professor, Clayton Christensen, wrote about the former Intel chief executive when he passed away in 2017. Christensen, who coined the term \"disruptive technology\", said he would most miss Grove's ability to understand how a complex organisation works, and to wield it to Intel's advantage.\n\nIt allowed Grove, who started at the company the day it was incorporated on July 18, 1968, to famously re-orient the business in the 1980s. Intel shifted away from memory chips for mainframe computers towards the microprocessor - the engine that spurs into motion when you turn on your computer.\n\nPropelled by a deal with IBM to put Intel processors into all its personal computers, the company came to provide Silicon Valley with one of its most essential technologies. Intel Inside and the accompanying jingle became one of the most memorable advertising slogans of the modern era.\n\nEven after five decades of dominance, no other company in the world can produce a better and faster microprocessor. Intel is at the pinnacle of an industry that manages to engineer miracles like no other. We tend to perceive innovation as something uncertain, particularly where it's so reliant on scientists to drive it forward. Yet Intel is anything but ambiguous. It has released successive advances in processor engineering like clockwork.\n\nIn 1965, future co-founder Gordon Moore made a bold prediction about the exponential growth of computing power. He predicted that the number of microchip transistors etched into a fixed area of a computer microprocessor would double every two years - and so, therefore, would computing power. Intel has since delivered on this improbable promise, immortalising \"Moore's law\".\n\nIt's difficult for anyone to fathom the effects of exponential growth. But it is why a single iPhone today possesses many times more computing power than the entire spacecraft for the NASA Apollo moon mission of 1969. Without Moore's law, there would be no Google, no Facebook, no Uber, no Airbnb. Silicon Valley would be like any other valley.\n\nThe Big Miss\n\nAnd yet, the iPhone is also what Intel missed. Immediately after the company won Apple's Mac business in 2005, Steve Jobs came asking for another chip for his smartphone. Intel certainly wanted to dominate this emerging sector but the price Jobs was offering was below its forecasted cost and it misjudged the size of the iPhone market. The company passed.\n\nApple had no choice but to build its own chipsets by licensing technologies from ARM, a British-based company controlled by Japanese interests. If Apple and its iPhone had been the only competitors, Intel might have been able to gradually adapt. But Google came in soon after with Android, a free operating system that Samsung, Huawei and HTC all adopted. Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments, all licensed by ARM, became the phone makers' go-to suppliers for energy-efficient, low-cost computing devices.\n\nThese American rivals are not trying to beat Intel. Qualcomm specialises in mobile phones and Nvidia specialises in graphics in video games. They all outsource production to third parties in Asia. But an Intel microprocessor sells for around US$100 while ARM-based chips sell for around US$10, and often less than a dollar. That's how ARM-based designs are now found in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.\n\nIn other words, Intel failed to compete in smartphones against those who have far less resources. It's a great irony when you reflect that Grove once invited Christensen to the Intel HQ in Santa Clara, California, to explain his theory on disruption. Grove later credited the meeting as the main driver for Intel's decision to launch the Celeron chip in 1998, a cheap product aimed at low-end PCs, which within a year captured 35% of the market.\n\nThe New Goldrush\n\nNow the big question is whether Intel is repeating its previous mistake with iPhones - this time in driverless cars. Last March it purchasedMobileye, an Israeli company that makes digital vision technology, for US$15.3 billion. It was a big bet in a sector that has huge potential: as autonomous driving takes off, vehicles are becoming computers on wheels. They will require more and more microchips and Intel hopes to dominate.\n\nExcept for one glitch. Everything Intel has done in the last 50 years is geared towards general purpose, high-end chipsets. Its integrated model - where the company designs and manufactures its processors - means it absorbs an enormous amount of fixed cost, in research and design as well as manufacturing.\n\nThe only way to offset these burdens is to sell a high volume of devices at high margins. The result is that the company is obsessed with technological progress, but has a rigid business model which limits what it can and cannot do. There's a monster inside Intel with a ferocious appetite.\n\nBut what if autonomous driving doesn't actually require the computing power Intel is counting on? This is the competing vision of Huawei. When I recently visited Shenzhen, executives from the Chinese telecom giant explained to me that much of the city's infrastructure will be digitalised and that Huawei will saturate it with a 5G network. This will drastically reduce any speed and latency problems for computers.\n\nThis means the computing inside cars can be mostly offloaded to the city's infrastructure. It is a radical vision, but clearly a viable alternative. The implication is that a BMW or Toyota doesn't need that many high-end chipsets after all. It's smartphones all over again.\n\nChristensen's insight was that successful companies die not because of complacency to change. Kodak, Polaroid, Blockbuster and DEC all understood the shifting landscape.\n\nBut in each case, their business model and the demands of existing shareholders formed an intractable nexus that even the most courageous executives found impossible to navigate. Grove once said, \"only the paranoid survive\". Maybe he was right.\n\nHoward Yu is a Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School\n\nThis article appeared in The Conversation.

Google immediately said it would appeal the fine\n\n\"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google spokesman Al Verney said in a statement. \"A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition. We will appeal the Commission's decision.\"\n\nDanish former minister Vestager spoke by telephone with Google chief Sundar Pichai on Tuesday night to tell him about the decision in advance.\n\nVestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser, thereby freezing out rivals.\n\nThey were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. Google Search and Chrome are as a result pre-installed on the \"significant majority\" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says. Google also prevented manufacturers from selling smartphones that run on rival operating systems based on the Android open source code, it said.\n\nGoogle finally gave \"financial incentives\" to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they pre-installed Google Search on their devices, the commission said.\n\nGoogle provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.\n\nUnder EU rules Google could have been fined up to 10 percent of parent company Alphabet's annual revenue, which hit $110.9 billion in 2017.\n\nVestager's campaign against Silicon Valley giants in her four years as the 28-nation European Union's competition commissioner has won praise in Europe but angered Washington.\n\nBrussels has repeatedly targeted Google over the past decade amid concerns about the Silicon Valley giant's dominance of internet search across Europe, where it commands about 90 percent of the market.\n\nAs well as the Android and Google Shopping files, it also has a third investigation under way, into Google's AdSense advert-placing business.\n\nVestager's other major scalps include Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe EU ordered Apple in 2016 to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes that the maker of iPhones and iPads had avoided by a tax deal with Dublin.\n\nIt has also taken on Facebook over privacy issues after it admitted that millions of users may have had their data hijacked by British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nBut Brussels has had US tech giants in its sights for a decade in a half, since it imposed a huge 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive behaviour and ruled it must make changes to its Windows system.\n\nThe Google decision comes just one week before European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to travel to the United States for crucial talks with Trump on the tariffs dispute and other issues. Transatlantic tensions are also high over Trump's berating NATO allies on defence spending at a summit last week, over his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and over the US president's pull-out from the Iran nuclear agreement and Paris climate deal.", "EUROPEAN regulators came down hard on US tech giant Google, fining it a record 4.34 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for forcing mobile phone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine - it represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google - the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it would appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behaviour.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the US, which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some US politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and \"should lead US enforcers to protect consumers.\" Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring mobile phone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU gave Google 90 days to come up with remedies that could allow rival search apps and browsers onto more phones. Failure to comply risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine was not disproportionate. The penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favouring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, made $12.7 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has US$102.9b (A$139b) in cash reserves.\n\n\"The important thing is not to be distracted by the size of the fine. What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behaviour,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that Google lets mobile phone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS. The EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing.

While Israel, a tiny strip of land in the Middle East, is only in 45th place on the global exporting league table.\n\nAnd importantly - Israel has always been a steadfast ally of the US.\n\nSo given the current trading spat between the US and China, you would expect Israel to be firmly on the American side.\n\nYet what many people don't know is that Chinese investment in Israel is continuing to boom, at the same time as a growing number of Israeli firms are entering the Chinese marketplace.\n\nSo while President Trump is slapping tariffs on Chinese exports and talking tough, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is happily encouraging his country's firms to accept Chinese investments, as the figures show.\n\nIn 2016 China's direct investment in Israel almost tripled to $16bn (\u00a312bn), according to a report in the South China Morning Post newspaper.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem Post predicts that China will overtake the US as the number one source of overseas investment in Israel.\n\nSo what has brought the two countries together, and should Israeli firms be cautious?\n\nOver the past two decades the Israeli economy has established itself as a leading hub of technological development.\n\nCommentators say that Chinese firms want to get their hands on that technology, at the same time as Israeli companies want better access to the giant Chinese marketplace.\n\n\"The Chinese are leveraging Israeli tech to fuel their economy, Israel is held in high esteem as a hub of innovation,\" says Hagai Tal, chief executive of Taptica, an Israeli mobile advertising company.\n\n\"China is set on learning as much as it can in order to position itself as an innovation economy.\n\n\"[Meanwhile], Israeli companies also see important opportunities in the East, and the meeting point of these two approaches is what produces such successful business partnerships.\"\n\nTo help bring Israeli and Chinese companies together, a number of business events are now held every year, such as Silicon Dragon Israel, which took place in Tel Aviv at the start of the year, and the China-Israel Innovation Summit, which was held earlier this month in Guangdong.\n\nRebecca Fannin, a founder of Silicon Dragon Israel, says Israeli tech start-ups that have secured Chinese investment tell her they \"are progressing faster with Chinese capital, and through introductions, collaborations, and easier access to the large China mainland markets\".\n\nIn recent years Israeli firms that have either been bought outright by Chinese companies, or sold them share of their business, include medical lasers operation Alma Lasers, and medical devices group Lumenis. Others are Israeli dairy business Tnuva, image recognition firm Cortica, and gesture control group Extreme Reality.\n\nRoyi Benyossef, an Israel-based manager at investment fund Samsung Next, says that the Chinese are \"mesmerized by Israel and its technology exporting capabilities\".\n\nOther commentators say that the different national characteristics of the two countries complement each other.\n\nPeggy Mizrahi, a Chinese citizen who lives in Israel, says: \"The Chinese are known for long-term planning, and being conservative and hierarchical, unlike the commonly recognised Israeli mindset of [being] fast, innovative, flexible, and having a lack of respect for authority.\"\n\nDaniel Galily, an Israeli expat who has lectured in business at Beijing Geely University, adds that: \"The educational system in China places great emphasis on discipline and obedience to superiors, while the Israeli educational system and the Israeli army encourage students and soldiers to think about new ideas, and to solve problems in situations of uncertainty.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that, and so they strive to integrate the Israeli creativity into their economy.\"\n\nHowever, it is not just Chinese firms that are benefiting from closer trade ties between the two countries.\n\nSpotad, an Israeli digital advertising firm, entered the Chinese market last year after securing funding from a Hong Kong-based private equity firm.\n\nThe company now works with all the major Chinese online advertising exchanges.\n\nOther Israeli firms that are continuing to make inroads into the Chinese market include mobile marketing firm AppsFlyer, and diamond trading platform Carats.\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nYet while both Chinese and Israeli firms seem pleased with their continuing cooperation, some commentators are anxious.\n\n\"One of the biggest drawbacks that I see here for Israel is that China is notorious for not respecting the intellectual property laws of other nations, so Israel has to be very careful about what kind of manufacturing they outsource to China,\" says Jason McNew, founder and boss of Pennsylvania-based Stronghold Cyber Security.\n\nLee Branstetter, professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, says that the concern in the US is that Israeli technology could ultimately find its way into the hands of the Chinese military.\n\n\"The Pentagon is increasingly worried that artificial intelligence capabilities acquired by Chinese firms through civilian investments or licensing deals could find their way into a new generation of Chinese weapons that would threaten American troops and American allies.\n\n\"The Pentagon is also worried that Israel could become a back door through which China could acquire capabilities that it could not get in the US due to regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\"I suspect that this will place some limits on the extent and magnitude of the emerging Israel-China relationship.

The alarming question is being posed by no less an authority than Spencer Dale, chief economist with BP, one of the world's \"supermajor\" oil and gas companies.\n\nAt first glance, the latest figures make for uncomfortable reading. Overall energy demand is up. Coal consumption is also up, for the first time in four years. And, perhaps most shockingly of all, greenhouse gas carbon emissions are rising again, after three years of little or no growth following a promised new era of international consensus on fighting climate change with the Paris Agreement in 2015.\n\nTo answer Dale's question, we need firstly to drill down into the figures.\n\nGlobal demand for energy rose 2.2 per cent last year, up from 1.2 per cent the previous year and above its 10-year average of 1.7 per cent.\n\nUnusually strong growth in the 35 countries affiliated to the international economic body the OECD was mainly responsible for the rise - growing prosperity in EU member states in particular.\n\nBut last month, the European Parliament and European Council struck a new binding renewable energy target for the EU for 2030 of 32 per cent. It is expected to lead to an accelerated adoption of electric vehicles as well as expanded solar and wind energy use.\n\nThe deal includes a tightening of rules on biofuels used in transport, notably crop-based fuels such as palm oil. Also stitched in are a range of \"citizen energy\" measures such as the exemption of rooftop solar panels of under 25 kilowatts from grid charges.\n\nA new target of 14 per cent renewable energy in transport, including incentives for electric vehicles, has been set.\n\nIn China, after a few years in the doldrums, the second-largest economy in the world bounced back with impressive growth last year - and with it an increasing demand for energy. Consumption was up by more than 3 per cent, almost three times the rate seen over the past couple of years.\n\nChina alone is behind a third of the rise in overall global energy use. This is partly down to its huge industry. In Westernised economies, industry accounts for slightly more than a fifth of a country's energy needs. In China, industry uses more than half.\n\nAdded to this problem is the predominant use of coal to fire power stations as well as direct burning in the likes of the ceramics and steel sectors. In its long-awaited 2018-2020 pollution action plan, published earlier this month, China's State Council has vowed to cut coal consumption, boost electric vehicle sales and shut more outdated steel and coke capacity in the coming three years.\n\nAlthough China is a major culprit in coal consumption, the mini-revival in the dirtiest of big fossil fuels has been fired up mostly by India\n\nIn its ongoing \"war on pollution\", the aspiring superpower is expanding its battleground to cover 82 cities, and the major coal-producing provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi have been added to the list of \"key\" pollution control regions.\n\nThe new plan will also cover the heavily industrialised province of Henan in central China, as well as the Yangtze river delta, which includes the provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and the region around Shanghai.\n\nBeijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan will be required to cut coal consumption by 10 per cent over the 2016 to 2020 period, while the Yangtze delta region will have to cut coal use by 5 per cent over the period.\n\nAlthough China is a major culprit in coal consumption, the mini-revival in the dirtiest of big fossil fuels has been fired up mostly by India. State-run Coal India, the world's second-largest coal mining company, can't keep up with demand at home, despite more than 200 million Indians having no regular access to electricity, and the country is increasingly turning to imports.\n\nBut as the impact of fossil fuel use becomes ever clearer on the environment, Delhi is renouncing a decade-old plan to power its economic resurgence almost entirely on coal, with a promise in June this year to reinvent itself as a green energy leader.\n\nA target for the amount of renewable energy capacity it plans to install by 2022 has been raised to more than 227 gigawatts from a previously ambitious 175 gigawatts.Plans include a tender \"in the near future\", according to Indian power minister RK Singh, for 100 gigawatts of solar power - 10 times the size of the current largest solar tender in the world.\n\nAs the price of renewable energy continues to plummet (one report estimates the cost of solar and wind in India is now half the price of coal), the country is predicted to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel.\n\nSome further hope can be taken from the latest BP statistical view of world energy, the definitive snapshot of global energy consumption, which shows that around 60 per cent of increased global energy use came from both renewable energy and gas. Natural gas was the single largest contributor, notably driven by a surge in its use in China. In the US, also, utilities are increasingly turning to natural gas, with predictions there that it will fuel half of all power plants in the coming years.\n\nAnd, despite US president Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement, dozens of the country's largest companies, including the likes of Apple and Google, are pumping billions of dollars into new wind and solar projects. Renewables currently make up a fifth of power generation in the US.\n\nIn South Korea this month, Samsung followed the lead of its US tech counterparts by announcing its plans to transition to entirely renewable energy in its offices and factories in the US, China and Europe over the next two years.\n\nElsewhere, Sweden is on course to reach its 2030 renewable energy target later this year after the installation of more than 3,500 wind turbines.\n\nCoal emerges as the biggest loser in the long run. The future electricity system will reorganise around cheap renewables\n\nGlobally, there has been a steep rise in the use of renewables last year, predominantly wind and solar power, which are up by 17 per cent. It is the largest yearly increase on record. Wind provided more than half of the growth, while solar contributed more than a third. Renewable power now makes up 3.6 per cent of the world's energy consumption, compared to the 23.4 per cent from natural gas, according to the BP report.\n\nDebate rages on the respective roles of both in powering future energy needs. The recently published Bloomberg New Energy Finance report puts the wind at green energy's back. The research firm forecasts coal use will drop from 38 per cent to 11 per cent by 2050, while wind and solar electricity will make up half of world's energy mix by the same time. It further predicts a 38 per cent drop in greenhouse gas emissions over the same period.\n\n\"Coal emerges as the biggest loser in the long run,\" said Elena Giannakopoulou, head of energy economics at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \"The future electricity system will reorganise around cheap renewables - coal gets squeezed out.\"\n\nFurthermore, the study foresees natural gas being used mostly as a back-up to renewable energy, dropping to just 15 per cent of the global energy mix by 2050.\n\nWhich brings us back to Spencer Dale's question on whether the global transition from fossil fuels to clean energy has gone into reverse.\n\n\"I would caution against being too alarmed by the recent data,\" he says of his own company's headline figures. \"We always knew that some of the exceptional outcomes seen in recent years reflected the impact of short-run cyclical factors, as well as longer-term structural forces shaping the energy transition. And, sure enough, some of those short-run adjustments came to an end last year.\n\n\"But many of the structural forces shaping the energy transition continued, particularly robust growth in renewables and natural gas. Last year's energy data is perhaps best seen as a case of two steps forward, one step back\".", "The smart speaker market isn't exactly welcoming to newcomers. Google and Amazon have dominated the competition with their Home and Echo device lines, respectively.\n\nThough part of their success likely comes from the two companies simply being the first to hit the market with solid products, both companies' devices sport feature-rich voice assistants, as well.\n\nApple tried to chip away at their lead with the HomePod, but despite the device's excellent sound quality, it hasn't quite reached the level of success Echo and Home devices have. Indeed, for now, it seems like most smart speaker owners have picked their team and stuck to it, seeing little reason to switch.\n\nDespite this reality, Samsung confirmed that they were working on a smart speaker of their own.\n\nDetails about the device were scarce, but Samsung's mobile division president DJ Koh told The Wall Street Journal that the focus would be on \"more premium,\" though it's not clear what he meant at the time.\n\nNow, however, we finally have some additional details about the device, courtesy of another WSJ report. The report claims the device, codenamed \"Lux,\" will be bowl-shaped with a stand at the bottom and lights at the top. It will also use Samsung's proprietary Bixby voice assistant.\n\nLux is expected to hit the market with a $300 price tag, lending credence to Koh's \"premium\" claim. Samsung is hoping to justify the speaker's high cost with an intriguing \"sound shifting\" feature, which lets the device send audio directly in a user's direction - similar to what Apple offers with the HomePod.\n\nIt's still not clear precisely when Lux will officially be unveiled, but there's a good chance it will debut at Samsung's upcoming event on August 9.", "Google has warned that it could start charging handset makers for using its Android software, potentially driving up the price consumers pay for smartphones and tablets.\n\nSundar Pichai, its chief executive, said that he could force the likes of Samsung and Huawei to pay for the software after the technology company was fined a record \u20ac4.3 billion by the European Commission yesterday.\n\n\"So far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology,\" Mr Pichai wrote in a blog post. \"We are concerned that today's decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal.\"\n\nHis warning raises the prospect that the cost of smartphones could rise as...", "3 colors are now available: black, silver blue and gold. Lavender will be available in the UK.\n\nVisually, Samsung fans will quickly find their marks because this device takes on the well-known lines of the A series of 2018 . Its standard-bearer is undoubtedly the Galaxy A8 and we have to admit that the devices are very similar, despite their big price difference, at least at first sight because the A6 is far from being as well equipped as its big brother.\n\nAt the front, we find more or less the same situation. With its 149.9 x 70.8 mm, the A6 has almost the same dimensions (the sizes of the bezels seem to be the same) but it's thinner at 7.7 mm. It is also lighter (159 grams). This is mainly due to the use of aluminium on the back of the device instead of glass. Above the screen, we can also see a difference in the arrangement of the sensors, as well as a deeper speaker grille.\n\nAt the rear, we can see antenna lines above and below. It doesn't look awful, but it's not my taste. As for the layout of the fingerprint reader and camera, it's exactly the same as on the A8 (2018). The single rear camera has a fingerprint scanner underneath, all housed in a rectangular module with slightly rounded edges. In fact, the fingerprint reader is much faster than facial recognition.\n\nThe headphone jack is of course present, and headphones are provided in the box (we will come back to this later). Unfortunately some elements are missing: Samsung doesn't give it USB Type-C or water resistance, which makes the A6 the ugly duckling of this year's A range. Can the rest turn it into a swan? It is obvious that Samsung cannot offer as high a level as it did with the A8, but release this as the pariah of the whole A range when even last year's models present better advantages seems rather strange.", "BRUSSELS -- European regulators came down hard on another U.S. tech giant Wednesday, fining Google a record $5 billion for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine, the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted .\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behaviour.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some U.S. politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and \"should lead US enforcers to protect consumers.\" Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU gave Google 90 days to come up with remedies that could allow rival search apps and browsers onto more phones. Failure to comply risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favouring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"The important thing is not to be distracted by the size of the fine. What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behaviour,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nGoogle argues that letting phone makers choose their apps could hurt the company's main means of making money through Android -- advertising and the sale of content and apps. Apple, in contrast, makes most of its money from the sale of devices.\n\nGiving phone makers more freedom to use altered versions of Android could also hurt Google. Samsung, a hugely popular maker of Android phones, could, for example, break off and take much of the Android system with it. Samsung had no immediate comment.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice-president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank in Washington, said the ruling \"is a blow to innovative, open-source business models.\"\n\nThe main complainant against Google was FairSearch, a Brussels-based lobbying group that has been backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and Nokia. It called the ruling \"an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the U.S. presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"", "The European Commission's enormous fine handed down to Google represents more than just a headline number. However, the overall demands won't change Android as we know it, even if Google can't successfully appeal the ruling.\n\nThe European Commission, on behalf of the EU, today fined Google $5 billion and demanded the company change its business model. Specifically, this relates to three core areas around preloading its apps on non-Google Android devices to support its internet search dominance.\n\n\"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\" European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. \"These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits.\"\n\nThe EU has effectively placed a 90-day ticking clock on Google to change their practices, or face accumulating penalties:\n\n\"Google must now bring the conduct effectively to an end within 90 days or face penalty payments of up to 5 [percent] of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company.\"\n\nThe EC continued:\n\n\"The decision does not prevent Google from putting in place a reasonable, fair, and objective system to ensure the correct functioning of Android devices using Google proprietary apps and services, without however affecting device manufacturers' freedom to produce devices based on Android forks.\"\n\nNow many are asking if the EU is right, wrong, or playing with Trump-fuelled fire.\n\nYou may be wondering how this will change Android.\n\nThe biggest relief for Google is that crucially, the EU is making Google responsible for making the demanded changes. Google will be monitored for compliance, but the firm has escaped ongoing monitoring or stringent oversight of Android's ongoing development. The EU also didn't demand Google modify Android to forcibly suggest alternative search engines or browsers, another potentially major problem.\n\nThis is massive. It makes this case very different to the infamous Microsoft antitrust case 20 years ago. The fines made the headlines then as well, but the EU's specific orders forced the firm to allow PC owners to choose a rival browser to Internet Explorer. This affected the entire business strategy for Microsoft moving forward.\n\nThe EU decision seeks to loosen Google's grip on bundling services with Android, but doesn't force Google to change Android to do it -- only what comes with it.\n\nPhone manufacturers will now be able to decide what services they want to include -- such as alternatives to Google Search and Chrome -- rather than being forced to include Google's apps. A manufacturer would also be able to offer a device with a forked version of Android, on a different development path to the \"core\" Android, if they elected to do so.\n\nThe EU's ruling on forking Android is probably too late though. It is highly unlikely a phone manufacturer would choose to fork Android. An OEM like Samsung would be extraordinarily ambitious to try to sell a phone without access to the Play Store, and without apps like Google Search, Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Assistant. There are alternatives, but they're not readily accessible for average users.\n\nGoogle apps, above and beyond third-party apps, have been the major driver in creating an Android experience that just works out of the box, regardless of the device.\n\nGoogle arguably does the best job with its services, making many of its apps the natural default choice. If a new phone offered Bing search over Google search out of the box, it would be rubbished for defaulting to a clear second-best option. By forcing manufacturers to do this, as the EU claims, Google ensures its dominance -- Bing can't get any better if no one uses it.\n\nGoogle becoming the only viable option for so many apps was always the intent behind product teams working to make each app best in class:\n\nThe (simplified) cycle above isn't true of every app the company makes. It's had plenty of failures, like when it forcibly bundled the Google Duo app.\n\nDespite the open-source nature of Android and the Android Open Source Project (ASOP), the company is in the same territory that saw Microsoft fined. The Google version of the app may be preferred in many cases, but that doesn't mean having it pre-installed is fair.\n\nIn addition, Android remains rather unfriendly for installing apps outside of its curated store. The apk file system and tight root security provides protection for inexperienced users, but installing files outside of the Play Store environment is far harder than installing outside software on Windows and macOS.\n\nSundar Pichai responded to the EU decision via the Google blog, noting the company's intent to appeal the decision.\n\n\"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation, and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition. We will appeal the Commission's decision.\"\n\nPichai claims the power of Android is that any alternative app can be freely downloaded, defending pre-installed apps and noting how easy they are to remove. However, Google surely understands having preinstalled apps on a device provides an advantage. Downloading an alternative is less likely if the utility is already provided.\n\nAnother political element swirling around this is the potential to ignite further EU-U.S. trade tension. The Trump administration has already been busy in this area.\n\nGoogle's intent to appeal the ruling will draw out this already long process even further. An appeal also almost certainly means Google won't have to pay the fine or change Android until a final decision is reached.\n\nThe cold reality for the EU is that most Android users prefer Google search, Google apps, and the Google ecosystem. Alternatives just aren't as good. Allowing competition out of the box may help new app developers find an audience, but it may just be too late.", "EUROPEAN regulators came down hard on US tech giant Google, fining it a record 4.34 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for forcing mobile phone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine - it represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google - the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it would appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behaviour.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the US, which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some US politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen.

The problem is that all of these manufacturers like LG, Samsung, all these people Have agreements with Google to include Google software whenever they're installing Android on a device. There are more than 24,000 devices that are running Android, and the EU says that that allows unfair competition, particularly in search. Google has said they plan to appeal. It's likely that this is gonna turn into quite a tussle, because, at the end of the day, this is about Google's business model. The idea that Android is free is fundamental to the way that all of these phones out there are being powered. And if Google is forced to change the way that it does things remove the software then how they pay for Android changes and it may turn into quite a problem. Right now this whole thing isn't going to affect anybody, it's a philosophical debate right? There's obviously money involved, the EU is starting to bare down on Google But the effects are unclear at the moment. But the possibility is that the way that Android works may very well change. If this rule actually gets cemented and the appeal doesn't win, then questions arise around how Google's gonna pay for Android going forward. The United States government has pretty much taken a pass with the tech industry until recently. For decades it was really this honeymoon period where, for the most part, it was hands-off and then the election meddling started. There was concerns about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, all these other things that popped up. And so now the government is starting to show some interest in regulating or possibly even doing more with the tech industry, but it's still very far away from them actually doing anything. Right now they're just kind of saber rattling. It's very clear that governments around the world are starting to take a serious look at how the tech industry works. And this hands off approach, that, particularly in the United States, but around the world really, is just coming to an end. And now these companies are going to have to deal with the implications of being treated like the large companies that they are.

Before, that's required scrolling down through several rows of categories.\n\n\"While this may feel like an obvious update to some, validating that this TV experience was better for our members took extensive research, testing and technology improvements,\" Garcia wrote.\n\nThe look of the new Netflix TV interface uses some of the same visual elements, like icons, that the company uses in its mobile apps.\n\nHere's a demo of the new Netflix TV UI in action:\n\nThe streaming giant's last major overhaul of its TV interface was in 2013, when it introduced a more visually oriented design designed to present a \"cinematic\" experience on big-screen TVs. In late 2016, Netflix added video previews to its connected-TV interface, another feature meant to spur viewers into streaming more content.\n\nNetflix's service is available on hundreds of devices, including Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Chromecast streaming-media players; smart TVs including those from Hisense, LG, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba and Vizio; and game consoles including Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Wii.\n\nAs of the end of June, Netflix reported 130.1 million streaming members worldwide, up 25% year over year.

Google Search and Chrome are as a result pre-installed on the \"significant majority\" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says.\n\nGoogle also prevented manufacturers from selling smartphones that run on rival operating systems based on the Android open source code, it said.\n\nGoogle finally gave \"financial incentives\" to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they pre-installed Google Search on their devices, the commission said.\n\nGoogle provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.\n\nUnder EU rules Google could have been fined up to 10 percent of parent company Alphabet's annual revenue, which hit $110.9 billion in 2017.\n\nVestager's campaign against Silicon Valley giants in her four years as the 28-nation European Union's competition commissioner has won praise in Europe but angered Washington.\n\nBrussels has repeatedly targeted Google over the past decade amid concerns about the Silicon Valley giant's dominance of internet search across Europe, where it commands about 90 percent of the market.\n\nAs well as the Android and Google Shopping files, it also has a third investigation under way, into Google's AdSense advert-placing business.\n\nVestager's other major scalps include Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe EU ordered Apple in 2016 to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes that the maker of iPhones and iPads had avoided by a tax deal with Dublin.\n\nIt has also taken on Facebook over privacy issues after it admitted that millions of users may have had their data hijacked by British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nBut Brussels has had US tech giants in its sights for a decade in a half, since it imposed a huge 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive behaviour and ruled it must make changes to its Windows system.\n\nThe Google decision comes just one week before European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to travel to the United States for crucial talks with Trump on the tariffs dispute and other issues.\n\nTransatlantic tensions are also high over Trump's berating NATO allies on defence spending at a summit last week, over his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and over the US president's pull-out from the Iran nuclear agreement and Paris climate deal. - AFP", "Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nConsidering Android's massive mobile market share, this was pretty much an inevitability. But yesterday it finally happened for real: The EU slapped Google's parent company Alphabet with a record fine of \u20ac4.34 billion ($6.83 billion) for violating European antitrust regulations.\n\nAccording to EU officials, Google's terms for licensing its full-featured version of the Android OS -- which requires device makers to pre-install Google apps such as Chrome, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and the Play Store -- violate antitrust laws and put competing products at an unfair disadvantage.\n\nFine of \u20ac4,34 bn to @Google for 3 types of illegal restrictions on the use of Android. In this way it has cemented the dominance of its search engine. Denying rivals a chance to innovate and compete on the merits. It's illegal under EU antitrust rules. @Google now has to stop it\n\n-- Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) July 18, 2018\n\nThe ruling cites deals with Samsung, Huawei, HTC and others as evidence of Google abusing its market dominance.\n\nAccording to EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, \"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits.\"\n\nAdditionally, the EU says Google's history of paying large manufacturers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app is unlawful, and that these practices have made the marketplace less competitive.\n\nNaturally, Google denies any wrongdoing. Yesterday it posted a blog from CEO Sundar Pichai titled, \"Android has created more choice, not less.\" In the blog, Pichai argued that the ruling \"ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones,\" and \"also misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices\".\n\nPichai also says removing a pre-installed app is easy, and in the post, there's even a gif showing how long it takes to delete one and replace it with something else, before Pichai concludes by saying that Google intends to appeal the decision.\n\nSee, it's so simple... (Gif: Google)\n\nThis most recent fine follows a \u20ac2.42 billion fine ($3.8 billion) from 2017, in which Google was accused of manipulating shopping results, and comes in the wake of rising fears of tech giants as a whole, especially after Facebook's mishandling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nAnd for those who remember back when Microsoft got sued for antitrust in 2001, it was a very similar situation in which the Microsoft was accused of having a monopoly over x86-based PCs and web browsers due to the company's practice of bundling Internet Explorer with Windows.\n\nHowever, even if Alphabet is forced to hand over \u20ac4.34 billion ($6.83 billion), it isn't as though Google doesn't have the money to pay up -- though with a net profit of $US12.6 billion ($17 billion) in 2017, the EU's fine would eliminate around 40 per cent of Alphabet's gains last year.\n\nAnd if Google refuses to comply with the EU's demands within 90 days, the company could get hit with additional penalties worth up to five per cent of Alphabet's \"average daily worldwide turnover\".\n\nThis is merely the start of a much bigger trend as tech giants face intensifying scrutiny from regulators and consumers alike.", "HP's Latest Is an Impressive Color-Critical IPS Display Aiming for the Sweet Spot Between Performance and Affordability\n\nOver the past few years, HP DreamColor monitors have become the default choice for many post-production facilities that do color-critical work. According to HP, 80 percent of the Academy Award nominees for visual effects since 2011 have used them. You'll find them in many of the top animation studios. And the DreamColor technology even won an Academy Award for itself (back in 2015) from the Scientific and Technical branch of the Academy.\n\nBut, as they say in Hollywood, \"You're only as good as your last picture.\" With the center of gravity having shifted to 4K, HP has been under pressure to offer a DCI 4K version of its DreamColor monitor. That monitor would need to have the same kind of color accuracy and post-production features that made the previous models so well-regarded throughout the industry.\n\nEnter the HP DreamColor Z31x Studio Display. It's a 31.1-inch 4K monitor with a native 4096 x 2160 resolution at 60Hz. It features a true 10-bit IPS panel that covers 99 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut (or 80 percent of BT.2020). The display has a typical 1500:1 contrast ratio, which is unusual for a high-quality IPS panel with such wide viewing angles. And there's a built-in colorimeter that can automatically calibrate the monitor, even when it's unattended.\n\nThis latest DreamColor has additional workflow features that are targeted specifically for post-production. There's an assortment of masks and markers to help you deal with various aspect ratios and safe action areas. (If you need something more specific, you can create your own markers with simple XML coding.) There's a True 2K upscaling option to help you deal with pixel artifacts when viewing HD content on a 4K display. And an integrated KVM switch can help you meet MPAA security guidelines for a fully isolated production network.\n\nWhy doesn't the Z31x cover 100 percent of DCI-P3, rather than the specified 99 percent? As you might expect, that last one percent is incredibly difficult to cover, unless you're willing to pay a much higher price for your color-critical monitor. In this case, the errors are in the green and red primaries, though the error rate is under a single delta-E point. With that small an error rate, the human eye wouldn't be able to see the difference. The monitor technically covers 99 percent, but in perceptual terms, it might as well be 100 percent.\n\nWhile the color gamut is only marginally improved over the first-generation Z27x, the contrast ratio for the Z31x is significantly improved. The Z31x is rated for a typical contrast ratio of 1500:1, and HP guarantees that the panel will have a minimum contrast ratio of 1200:1. That's a big deal. Most manufacturers won't set a minimum, so you're stuck with whatever variance occurs within the manufacturing process. HP has instructed the panel manufacturer to test and reject any panel that doesn't meet the minimum requirement. That should be a standard guarantee for any monitor, but it's actually highly unusual. When the monitor specifications show a \"typical\" contrast ratio with no minimum listed, you're betting that the panel manufacturer doesn't have off days.\n\nSo who makes the panel for the Z31x? There's an interesting background story on this, because the current crop of IPS panels may have been compromised to make them more widely available. According to Greg Staten, who is HP's DreamColor product manager, HP couldn't find a panel with the performance it needed because the panel manufacturers had altered the original IPS design to lower the cost of the panels. \"The dynamic color was sacrificed,\" Staten explained. \"The viewing cone -- the true viewable width of the display -- was reduced.\" And the newer panels have an issue that Staten refers to as black lift. \"That's where as you move your head either up or down, as if you were standing up or, most critically, for someone who is standing off shoulder, you see a different level of gray in the black.\"\n\nThat last issue wasn't a problem with the first-generation Z27x, when the IPS panels were manufactured to an earlier, less-compromised standard. So HP approached Panasonic and asked that company to use the original IPS patent as a basis for creating a new, customized panel for the Z31x. HP refers to the panel technology as High Performance IPS, though it may be more accurate to think of it as Classic IPS Plus.\n\nThe biggest difference in the Z31x panel over the previous Z27x panel is its ability to render deep and pure blacks. If you're hoping to find OLED-type blacks in a reasonably priced IPS display, this is as close as you'll be able to get with the current technologies. When you place a Z31x monitor beside an older Z27x monitor, you'll see that the blacks are noticeably improved, to the point where you may not want to go back.\n\nBecause Panasonic adapted the panel from its earlier IPS technology, the displayed image remains remarkably consistent across its 178-degree viewing range, both horizontally and vertically. If you tend to use your monitor to show content to more than one person at a time, this could be a critical advantage. The fall-off in contrast, color, and brightness is barely noticeable across the angles that would typically involve group viewing. And the anti-glare matte surface on the display will be easier on the eyes when multiple people are viewing the monitor. You'll see some slight reflection, but it's diffuse enough that you can ignore it without much effort.\n\nRegular color calibration is essential for color critical work. For larger facilities, it's often complicated by having to have multiple displays calibrated to a single source. And for smaller facilities, color calibration is often delayed or never done, because the process is too time consuming or disruptive.\n\nThe built-in colorimeter in the Z31x allows the calibration process to occur without human intervention, or even without having a computer attached. The colorimeter is motorized, with a sensor that automatically drops down from the upper bezel. You can set up the calibration on a schedule that you determine, such as midnight every Saturday night. You could have the monitor wake up at 8:00 a.m. each morning and perform a daily calibration at 8:30 a.m., after the panel's colors have had a chance to stabilize. Or you could run the calibration on demand, if you need to quickly align the monitor.\n\nThe Z31x ships with seven factory-calibrated color presets: DCI-P3 D65, BT.709, BT.2020, sRGB D65, sRGB D50, Adobe RGB D65, and Adobe RGB D50. And you can recalibrate any of the factory presets to accommodate your preferences. For example, the sRGB D65 is set to the full luminance level of 250 cd/m, which is quite bright. You might recalibrate the sRGB D65 preset to a more moderate 100 cd/m.\n\nThe most powerful way to operate the internal calibration system is to control it with your own XML-based instructions. The StudioCal XML code that the Z31x supports is simple and straightforward, and HP provides examples in the user guide and website that you can run as-is or modify.\n\nIt's worth exploring the StudioCal XML feature, because you can use the code to alter more than just the calibration settings. You can name your color presets, specify the color primaries and white point, perform a customized validation pass, and archive your monitor's calibrated LUTs to a USB flash drive. You can even use an XML script to dump the monitor's entire configuration to a flash drive, so that the configuration can be duplicated on another Z31x.\n\nSome facilities own expensive colorimeters, spectrophotometers, and spectroradiometers that they use to calibrate their projectors and high-end monitors. The Z31x supports a direct connection to many of these devices, including various models from Klein Instruments, Photo Research, Konica Minolta, X-Rite, and Colorimetry Research. You'll be able to align the Z31x's internal colorimeter to your house reference instrument. The Z31x runs a correlation calculation to compare its own calibration with the calibration in the external instrument. It then adjusts its own measurements to take into account any difference in the measurements. That way, all your displays can be calibrated to a single source.\n\nThe native resolution in the Z31x matches the full frame DCI 4K standard (4096 \u00d7 2160). That's very close to a 17:9 aspect ratio, which is wider than the 16:9 aspect ratio associated with the SMPTE UHDTV1 4K standard (3840 \u00d7 2160). The Z31x provides various fill-to-screen options (proportional and non-proportional) for 3840 \u00d7 2160 source input. It also supports DCI masking for 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. When DCI masking is enabled, the source signal is masked to show only the pixels within the chosen aspect ratio.\n\nYou'll find a wide range of industry-standard markers in the Z31x. And you can create your own markers using the supported XML scripting capability. The customized markers can have as many as 16 on-screen lines, with each line having its own color and line width. The lines can be as wide as 10 pixels. The Z31x user guide has marker examples in XML code that you can use as is or modify.\n\nThe ability to customize your own markers could be especially useful if you create content for the TV networks, which often have holdout areas for pop-outs, bugs, or promos. If you're adding subtitles to your video, for example, you wouldn't want the network to run a graphic on top of your subtitles. Once you have the specifications from the network, you can rope off those areas within the display so that you can see when editing which spaces are reserved for the network.\n\nWhile 4K is coming in fast, most in post-production still deal with HD content on a regular basis. And we'll likely be viewing 1080p video on our 4K monitors for many years to come. That could be a problem if the 4K monitor doesn't properly scale up the content. Any monitor or consumer TV can blindly convert HD to 4K, but if it doesn't scale correctly, the image will be soft. And the scaler may artificially sharpen the video to counteract the softening. This might be fine for causal TV viewing. However, it could be a serious drawback if your job involves evaluating pixel defects or other quality issues as part of your workflow.\n\nInstead of just blowing up the HD video to fit into a 4K frame, the Z31x's True 2K mode doubles the pixels of the video both vertically and horizontally, so that each pixel becomes exactly four pixels when you view either 2048 x 1080 or 1920 x 1080 video. No video interpolation is applied. With 720p video, each pixel becomes nine pixels. You may not want to view your computer desktop this way, especially with the one-to-nine scaling for 720p. In that case, you may decide to switch on this particular feature only when using the Z31x as an external monitor.\n\nOther options for displaying sub-4K video include a pixel-for-pixel mode. With this mode, lower-resolution video is shown in its native size along with a border to fill out the 4K frame. The Z31x offers a picture-in-picture mode, where one video source is overlaid over another, as well as a 2 x 1 dual split, where one video source is positioned horizontally adjacent to the other. To show full-height side-by-side sources, you'll want to set the display resolution in your operating system to 2048\u00d72160.\n\nThe built-in KVM switch could end up being one of the most important additions to your daily routine. If you've had to implement a production network that's completely isolated from the internet, based on recent security recommendations from the MPAA, you may be using two keyboards, two mice, and two computers just to answer your email while working on your video. The Z31x has a keyboard USB port that includes the same chipset that you would find in a dedicated KVM. If the port sees a specific keystroke combination (Ctrl, Ctrl, Up Arrow), it can switch to another computer network and hand off all USB data to that other computer. The KVM feature can work with any two of the five inputs. And you can use the picture-in-picture or split-screen modes to view both networks at the same time. If you're rendering a project and want to keep an eye on the rendering process while you check your email, you could strategically position the picture-in-picture so that both tasks are visible at the same time.\n\nA professional-quality KVM switch can cost hundreds of dollars, so having a KVM switch built into the monitor could be a real plus if you need to work on a secure network. Everyone else can just leave the KVM feature in its default off position. That way, you won't have to worry about accidentally pressing Ctrl, Ctrl, Up Arrow.\n\nIn case you're wondering, there's no built-in SDI converter, like the one that you'll find inside the Sony BVM-X300. In order to keep the price at a more manageable level, HP chose to include an SDI accessory mount rather than an SDI converter, which many potential buyers would rather not have to pay for. The accessory mount is compatible with SDI mini-converters from AJA and Blackmagic Design.\n\nI've been using a first-generation Z27x as my main monitor for the past few years, and I was surprised how much better video and photos look on the Z31x. There's only a small increase in the color gamut between the two models (from 98.8 percent to 99 percent of DCI-P3), but there's a big jump in the typical contrast range (from 1000:1 to 1500:1). The blacker blacks enrich all the colors -- not just black and white content -- providing a more satisfying and realistic rendition.\n\nThe image quality on the Z31x holds up extremely well when viewed from almost any angle. It's easy for a manufacturer to quote an impressively wide viewing angle, but all too often, the color and contrast fade quickly as you move off center. That's not the case with this monitor.\n\nThere does seem to be a slight reduction in the response time for the Z31x. Where the original Z27x had a 7ms response time, the Z31x has an 8.5ms response time. Personally I didn't see any increased lag when viewing fast-moving video on the Z31x versus the Z27x, but it could be an issue if motion discrepancies are critical to your work.\n\nThose response times were measured with the overdrive mode enabled. With overdrive switched on, you can improve the response time and reduce image smearing, but you'll run into some limitations with this monitor. For example, the picture-in-picture feature may be disabled for certain input resolutions when the overdrive mode is engaged. According to HP's datasheet for this monitor, the Z31x has a 20ms response time when overdrive is switched off. The onscreen menus let you enable or disable the overdrive mode.\n\nThe calibration process went smoothly, both when I scheduled it for off hours and when I ran it on demand for a quick adjustment. Unfortunately, there's no provision for interrupting the process once it begins. Keep that in mind if you decide to calibrate the display in the middle of a busy work day. The monitor (and possibly your computer) will be inaccessible for approximately 16 minutes.\n\nI did find that the on-screen menus can be considerably slower on the Z31x than on the first-generation Z27x. It's not just that there are more menus and settings than before, which you would expect given the extra features and support for additional standards. The menus themselves seem to update more slowly. I saw the biggest difference when I manually changed the luminance level. For example, when I lowered the luminance level from 100 cd/m to 48 cd/m using the bezel-mounted function buttons, it took 15 seconds to traverse that range on the Z31x compared with just 3 seconds on the Z27x. Given that the internal processor is likely faster in the Z31x than the first-generation Z27x, the slower menus may be an issue that could be corrected later via a firmware update.\n\nEven though the Z31x isn't designed for home-theater use, it does support HDCP on all its video inputs. I was able to view a Dunkirk 4K UHD disc that was playing through an Oppo UHD-203 disc player. And I was able to view a 4K version of Blade Runner 2049 that was streaming from an Apple TV 4K. Unfortunately, the Z31x doesn't support HDR in any of its current forms. Though restricted to SDR, the 4K video quality was impressive when combined with the UHD-203 and Apple TV.\n\nIt's an exciting time to be shopping for a 4K display. On the high end, we have some extremely capable 4K monitors, such as the Sony BVM-X300 30-inch 4K OLED monitor and Canon DP-V3010 30-inch 4K IPS monitor. Both can handle 4096 x 2160, but they're considerably more expensive than the Z31x. Rising up from below, we have a new crop of HDR-compatible 4K monitors that are targeted to gamers. These include the Acer Predator X27 and ASUS ROG Swift PG27UQ. They have fast refresh rates, but these are UHD-resolution monitors with a more limited color gamut. And there are quite a few less-expensive 4K monitors from companies such as Dell, LG, Samsung, and BenQ. They tend to be UHD rather than DCI 4K, and they don't offer as many relevant features as the Z31x.\n\nHP is hoping to fill that sweet spot for professionals who are willing to pay a premium for a color-critical DCI 4K monitor but would balk at paying too much of a premium to get there. With its high-quality IPS display, automated calibration, XML scripting, and industry-standard masks and markers, the HP DreamColor Z31x Studio Display is likely to become the workhorse DCI 4K monitor for post-production, visual effects, and animation.", "So far today, we've heard rumors about Samsung's foldable smartphone and its Galaxy Watch, and now info on another upcoming Samsung device has leaked.\n\nSamsung's oft-rumored Bixby speaker will launch soon, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Specifically, the device will be announced soon and its launch will \"track closely\" with the debut of the Galaxy Note 9, which will be announced on August 9th.\n\nThe Bixby speaker, which is said to be codenamed \"Lux\", will cost around $300. The device is said to have a bowl-shaped design with a legged bottom and lights at the top. Its feature set will reportedly include sound shifting, which will beam the audio in the direction of the person talking to the speaker, and Samsung is expected to market the deice as a high-end music player.\n\nWe've been hearing about Samsung's Bixby speaker for awhile now, so it's nice to hear that the device is finally close to launch. It sounds like it'll be more like the Apple HomePod than the Google Home or Amazon Echo, focusing more on being a high-quality music player than a home assistant. That's kind of surprising since you might think that Samsung would want a lower-priced device to try and get people hooked on Bixby, but we'll have to wait until Samsung actually launches the speaker before we get all of the details on its features and pricing.

Distributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 18 July 2018 21:56:04 UTC", "IT MAY shock you to learn that those little characters that the kids like using so much these days are actually governed by a bunch of suits.\n\nA Californian organisation called Unicode Consortium is the emoji gatekeeper and it's not as simple as it might seem.\n\nThe 24-year-old organisation has become tasked, somewhat unexpectedly, with governing what some see as the first digital universal language. It was originally set up to develop standards for translating alphabets into code that can be read across all computers and operating systems and its membership is full of typographers and computer scientists.\n\nBut among other things it has come to be in charge of selecting and overseeing emojis -- and it's a responsibility that comes with some genuine ideological battles.\n\nLate last year the group was embroiled in a fierce debate about animated poo and if you weren't aware of it, it's well worth revisiting to show just how tricky the business of emoji sanctioning can get.\n\nTHE GREAT DEBATE ... ABOUT POO\n\nIt all started with a series of proposed emoji characters for the June 2018 class that included a \"Frowning Pile Of Poo\" emoji which rankled many members and caused a huge pushback by those who thought it cheapened the work of the group.\n\n\"This should embarrass absolutely everyone who votes yes on such an excrescence,\" wrote typographer Michael Everson in a response to the proposal.\n\n\"Will we have a CRYING PILE OF POO next? PILE OF POO WITH TONGUE STICKING OUT? PILE OF POO WITH QUESTION MARKS FOR EYES?\"\n\nIn December, the months-long dispute came to an end when the consortium nixed the idea of a frowning poo emoji.\n\nHowever it did say changes to the \"pile of poo\" emoji had not been totally dumped. There is hope yet.\n\nTHE EMOJIS THAT ARE BANNED\n\nWorld Emoji Day fell this week, with Apple taking the opportunity to tease some new characters coming to its operating system later this year.\n\nThere are 2666 emojis in the wild so you've got plenty of options to relay your picture-based message. But what about all the controversial icons that have been banned over the years?\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a bunch of tiny cartoons that you won't be able to use today because the powers that be shut them out of your smartphone.\n\nThey include everything from a gun emoji to an erecting condom, all of which were either axed or rejected by the Unicode Consortium.\n\nOther notable entries include a dodo bird, a marijuana leaf, a woman rowing a boat, and a polar bear on a melting ice cap.\n\nMost of which are harmless enough -- so why the disdain?\n\nAnyone can submit an emoji to Unicode, according to the organisation's president and co-founder Mark Davis. Getting selected is a bit trickier though.\n\n\"We get submissions from all over the world,\" Mr Davis previously said in an interview.\n\n\"People need to make a case as to why they think their emoji is going to be frequently used, how it breaks new ground, how it is different from other emojis that have already been encoded.\"\n\nLogos, brands and emojis related to specific companies are not accepted.\n\n\"We also don't accept specific people. We did encode a cowboy but we wouldn't encode John Wayne,\" Mr Davis said.\n\nAnd some concepts simply do not translate as emojis.\n\n\"Anything that needs a lot of detail to explain or understand is trouble. It's also hard to make an emoji for something abstract -- like good governance, or a responsible president,\" Mr Davis said.\n\nLuckily for you, the rejected candidates have now been collected in a handy iPhone app which lets you send them to your friends.\n\nDeclined Emoji: Part 1 is now available for free on the iOS App Store and contains around 30 of the emojis that were officially sent back.\n\nThey also include an orange mammoth with blue tusks, a naked bum, and Donald Trump getting chased by bees.\n\nThe most high-profile emojis to ever be banned were the rifle and gun icons, which have been pulled from platforms by the likes of Apple, Samsung, WhatsApp and Twitter.\n\nThe move highlighted the influence the tech giants have over the texting language we use, as they can essentially nix or tweak any Unicode-approved emojis for their respective apps.\n\nIt also helps that members of Apple, Facebook and Google sit on Unicode's board, giving them a say on the characters that make the final cut.", "A lot of people might have given up on Bixby but it seems Samsung is still willing to make it mainstream with a rumored launch of a smart speaker running Bixby 2.0 at its \"Unpacked\" event taking place on August 9.\n\nThe new smart speaker will directly compete with the likes of Google Home, Amazon Echo and Apple's very own HomePod that's powered by Siri. The rumored smart speaker by the Korean tech giant was initially confirmed to be launching midway in 2018 according to DJ Koh, the president of Samsung's mobile division.\n\nA new report from The Wall Street Journal claims that the new speaker might make an appearance alongside the Galaxy Note9 - the upcoming Note flagship from the company. The report from WSJ also mentions the rumored price to be $300, which is a price point that tackles Google's $400 Home Max and Apple's HomePod which retails at $350.\n\nThe new smart speaker will supposedly be running Bixby 2.0; Samsung launched the SDK for Bixby 2.0 last year, and at this year's MWC Samsung Co-CEO Koh Dong-jin claimed that the company will be able to showcase the new version of their virtual assistant with the Galaxy Note9.\n\nAs per the report, Samsung's version of their Bixby smart speaker \"has a bowled shape, with a legged bottom and lights at the top.\" With a $300 price tag, Samsung will definitely try to market the new smart speaker as a premium one and it might even act as a hub for the company's SmartThings suite of smart home accessories.\n\nBixby has remained less than appealing on the smartphones that the company has to offer but it does have the ability to do things that other virtual assistants aren't yet able to, such as being able to post content on social media platforms.\n\nIt will definitely be interesting to see what plans Samsung has with its smart speaker.\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal via The Verge", "At $250, the Essential Phone was arguably the best deal of Amazon Prime Day. Which is saying a lot. But no matter how you slice it, 50 percent off an Android flagship is a pretty tough deal to beat. I know of at least one TechCruncher who couldn't resist the lure of that kind of discount.\n\nNow that Prime Day is over, the phone's price is back up at $499 -- but the deals, it seems, keep on coming. Over on Essential's site, you'll find the company's modular 360 Camera for $19. That's a mind-boggling 90 percent off its MSRP -- the kind of deal that has \"fire sale\" written all over it.\n\nIn other circumstances, you could chalk up a killer deal or two to an inventory refresh. Hell, it's almost a year since the PH-1 handset hit the market, so the company could have a replacement in the works. The context of other recent news around the company, however, paints a very different picture.\n\nIn February, the company was reported to have only shipped 88,000 phones the prior year. In May, word got out that founder Andy Rubin was looking to put the company up for sale and had cancelled work on the followup phone. The company didn't issue a flat-out denial, but instead insisted that it still had products in the works.\n\n\"We always have multiple products in development at the same time and we embrace canceling some in favor of the ones we think will be bigger hits,\" it said at the time. \"We are putting all of our efforts towards our future, game-changing products, which include mobile and home products.\"\n\nIndeed, the gears are still turning and the lights are on over at Essential HQ. The company announced that it was expanding to additional markets, including Canada, France, Japan and the U.K. And last month the company finally announced its second modular accessory, the Audio Adapter HD. That plug-in brings HD audio playback to the device. The company is also continuing to offer quick software support and has already promised to be one of the first to offer an update to Android P when it arrives.\n\nWe reached out to the company for an update and received the following statement from a spokesperson, \"We're offering a great deal on the Essential 360 Camera accessory so new customers who bought our phone during Amazon Prime Day can enjoy the full Essential experience.\"\n\nSo, perhaps there's something to be said for roping people into the ecosystem and then offering a doubly deep discount on an accessory that only works with that device.\n\nFor its part, Essential has always acknowledged that it's had a tough road ahead. At an event in New York prior to the release of the PH-1, an executive outlined a 10-year plan to become a truly successful contender in a category dominated by tech titans like Samsung and Apple. And that $300 million from Access Technology Ventures, Tencent, Foxconn and Amazon certainly didn't hurt.\n\nIf the rumors are true, this would be a sad end for a hardware startup with good devices and a grand ambition. Given what the company laid out early on, it was clear that it's only just getting started with its innovative approach to mobile and the smart home. But hardware is hard, as the well-trod saying goes -- that's the case even if you have boatloads of funding and happen to be the guy who created Android.", "It folds like a wallet... and your real wallet won't like the rumored price\n\nNext year, Samsung hopes you'll spend thousands of dollars on its new, cutting-edge foldable phone.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy X smartphone, codenamed \"Winner\", is a fully bendable and foldable device that, when flat, will be the size of a small tablet, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe device will launch in early 2019, its sources say. This aligns with previous reports suggesting that Samsung hoped to launch the device during Mobile World Congress in February.\n\nThe Galaxy X will reportedly measure seven inches diagonally when flat; for comparison, the iPad Mini 4 tablet measures 7.9 inches diagonally. To fit in your pocket, Samsung's phone will fold in half \"like a wallet\".\n\nOne side of the smartphone will have the primary display , while the back of the device would also feature a secondary \"display bar\" on one folded side and cameras on the other side.\n\nSamsung patents and renderings have long pointed to a foldable phone in the works:\n\nImage 1 of 7Image 2 of 7Image 3 of 7Image 4 of 7Image 5 of 7Image 6 of 7Image 7 of 7\n\nIn one 2017 patent, Samsung detailed a foldable display that would hinge like a flip phone. In another patent, Samsung showed how the home interface would automatically spread across two screens when the phone is folded.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's sources appear to confirm that both of these designs could easily feature in the final product.\n\nSamsung hopes to target the smartphone to a more hardcore demographic of gamers, the report says, before trying to reach a wider audience later in 2019. However, the rumored price of the smartphone could drive away casual buyers.\n\nSamsung reportedly wants you to pay more than $1,500 (about \u00a31,150 / AU$2,000) for the device. Neither the Galaxy Note 8 nor the Galaxy S9 Plus come close to this price tag.\n\nIn the same report, the Wall Street Journal also claimed that Samsung's Bixby speaker would be officially announced this August, during the Samsung Unpacked event in New York City.\n\nA foldable smartphone revolution?\n\nConsidering the Galaxy X's similarities to the foldable (but not bendable) Nintendo 3DS, the split display could certainly appeal as a gaming platform. But the 3DS costs a couple hundred bucks/pounds, and Nintendo specializes in gaming.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see if enough developers buy into Samsung's foldable platform and make games specialized for two phone screens instead of one.\n\nRight now, only one foldable smartphone is on the market: the ZTE Axon M, which has a hinge, but not a bendable display. However, other major tech companies are racing to catch up with Samsung and release their own bendable smartphones.\n\nHuawei may actually outpace Samsung to launch its own foldable flagship device. The latest rumors suggest Huawei will showcase its still-unnamed flexible phone in November, and will aim for an early 2019 launch. Its device may employ LG's flexible screen tech.\n\nOther major firms, on the other hand, look more likely to sell foldable devices by 2020 or later.\n\nApple has patented its own foldable displays, but a top analyst believes Apple is targeting a 2020 launch for such a device. Sony and Lenovo, meanwhile, have dropped hints about foldable screens, but we have no patents or insider reports to suggest those will launch anytime soon.\n\n5 reasons you need a foldable smartphone", "With the announcement by President Trump that the U.S. would start the process of imposing 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports in the next few months, it is safe to say that the U.S.-China trade war has definitively moved past the phony war phase. This action goes well beyond placating some important rust belt/swing-state constituencies and reflects the president's deeply held belief that trade is a zero-sum game in which the U.S. has been persistently played for patsies over the last several decades, especially by Beijing (although, as last month's G7 summit demonstrated, neither the EU, nor Canada, is exempt from this animus either). The cumulative actions undertaken by the president now account for almost 7 percent of total global trade, according to the economist George Magnus, reflecting the magnitude of Trump's efforts.\n\nIf Trump is actually hoping that tariffs will enhance the possibility of boosting America's export markets, he's in for disappointment and a good deal of anger from the very economic sectors he might have expected to champion him. Modern global supply networks have been established on the assumption that globalized free trade and capital mobility were permanent realities. The so-called \"Washington Consensus\" has assumed globalization as an irreversible process to such a degree that U.S. companies are utterly reliant on global supply chains.\n\nSo what is the solution? Perhaps that might come via the imposition of local content requirements as opposed to a haphazard reliance on tariffs, which is to say that when a foreign company manufactures a product in a country, a certain proportion of those materials and parts should be made in that country domestically rather than imported. This is not unusual. In fact, China makes use of this practice very liberally, and insists that a minimum level of local content is required, when giving foreign companies the right to manufacture in a particular place. And if this requirement is mandated going forward, it may well arrest the ongoing \"de-skilling\" of the American labor force (because it slows the outsourcing of manufacturing), as well as curbing labor arbitrage (to be fair, labor arbitrage is less of a problem when free trade pacts are done between countries/regional blocs of comparable living standards, such as the recently concluded EU-Japan trade pact). So it's potentially a win-win for American workers and businesses.\n\nIn a previous article, I explored the possibility of U.S. consumers being impacted in the event of a supply disruption engineered by Beijing using its dominant production in either rare earths or ascorbic acid, which is widely used in food production to improve quality and stability. Given the relatively self-sufficient nature of the American economy, the U.S. can probably withstand this kind of potential trade shock better than most countries, and ultimately can crank up production domestically to mitigate any short-term threat to supplies from China. More problematic has been the longstanding proclivity to outsource manufacturing rather than raw or refined materials, the long-term effects of which are more difficult to alleviate.\n\nThe U.S. will have to consider adopting policies to re-establish an \"industrial ecosystem\" (to coin a phrase used by political economist Seymour Melman) if it is to mitigate the threat posed by overseas supply disruptions, and counter the longstanding lament of U.S. manufacturers that they cannot find American workers with the right mix of domestic skills. The latter point is addressed in a Harvard Business Review study by Professors Gary Pisano and Willy Shih:\n\n\"Tool and die makers, maintenance technicians, operators capable of working with highly sophisticated computer-controlled equipment, skilled welders, and even production engineers are in short supply.\n\n\"The reasons for such shortages are easy to understand. As manufacturing plants closed or scaled back, many people in those occupations moved on to other things or retired. Seeing fewer job prospects down the road, young people opted for other careers. And many community and vocational schools, starved of students, scaled back their technical programs.\"\n\nThe authors rightly note that the complaint of U.S. manufacturers that they do not have enough skilled workers confuses cause and effect. But the problem is even more serious than suggested by Pisano and Shih: Through massive outsourcing of the supply chain, the U.S. has empowered countries such as China with far greater leverage on trade matters. Instead of responding with a tit-for-tat tariff, the Chinese premier now can simply threaten to cut off Apple, or IBM, or any number of U.S. multinationals from critical parts.\n\nWe cannot entangle our supply chain so thoroughly with another country that their companies can ignore U.S. law and get away with it, because of a credible threat to the supply chain. No one country should have that power -- however, the reality is that we live in a world where an automobile is made of parts 80 percent supplied by outside producers, from sometimes dozens of countries. This process can be highly efficient from a cost perspective in a global market, but in a world filled with tariffs, it can be mitigated by enforcing indigenization everywhere in the high value added supply chains to which all economies aspire.\n\nThe imposition of local content rules would end the possibility of any country cornering the market, thus reducing incentives for currency manipulation or subsidies. Done right, local content requirements would destroy the business models of chronic surplus countries like Germany, Japan and China. Their firms could invest in transplanted companies abroad, but the transplants would be de facto local factories, rather than designed for re-export back into the American market (in contrast to the current trade regime where -- per a New York Times report -- \"Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world's largest consumer market\").\n\nHow to do this the right way? Let's say there are four major markets that are also major producers: North America, Europe, East Asia and South Asia. Most trade is done within the same industrial sectors generally, as opposed to distinct and separate industries. They agree that each region can reserve 25 percent of its market for locally produced goods (or more realistically, components of final assembly goods). The other three blocs can compete for the other three-quarters of the local bloc market. If the locally produced share falls below one-fourth of the local bloc market, it can impose quotas while helping the local producers regain their share, preferably by improved productivity or business models.\n\nLocal content requirements are much more trade-friendly than tariffs since policy-makers are protecting a fraction of the market, not the full 100 percent. Once you eliminate the incentive to run merchandise trade surpluses, you don't need all the elaborate schemes for deterring or sterilizing them. And it mitigates the need to resort to tariffs which, in any case, create both winners and losers, without necessarily resolving the problems that the tariffs were designed to solve in the first place.\n\nPart of the reason why there has been such a proclivity toward offshoring manufacturing is that manufacturing itself is viewed as a cost variability through the narrow prism of short-term profitability (beating the quarterly number has been an ongoing game on Wall Street, used to perfection by figures such as GE's former CEO, Jack Welch). As a result, note Pisano and Shih, \"executives... give short shrift to the impact that outsourcing or offshoring it may have on a company's capacity to innovate. Indeed, most don't consider manufacturing to be part of a company's innovation system at all.\"\n\nThe problem goes beyond that, as Seymour Melman noted in his book, Dynamic Factors in Industrial Productivity, where he makes the case that the unremitting focus on low-cost labor inhibits technological innovation and invariably pushes companies to global labor arbitrage. The basic idea was elaborated by one of Melman's former researchers, the political economist Jon Rynn:\n\n\"[F]aced with high labor costs, firm managers will be more willing to mechanize, that is, use more machinery, and more sophisticated machinery, instead of using labor. By using more, better machinery, they increase labor productivity, which leads to higher wages, and they also stay at the cutting edge of technology.\"\n\nRetaining a degree of homegrown manufacturing also mitigates the production risks posed by divorcing product design and manufacturing (such as originally occurred with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program, which was characterized by massive cost overruns and ongoing engineering problems).\n\nNeedless to say, these sorts of ideas are despised by the apostles of free trade, who have conveniently dismissed globalization's losers as \"negative externalities,\" the \"deplorables\" who (as I have noted before) have been \"displaced from their jobs by globalization, automation, and the shifting balance in manufacturing from the importance of the raw materials that go into products to that of the engineering expertise that designs them.\" There is also the issue of WTO rules, which limit the degree to which local content rules can be deployed (generally okay for government procurement on infrastructure, but problematic beyond that). That might explain part of the public musing by Trump in regard to America's future relationship with the WTO or observance of its rules. But the truth is that America's workers have suffered major displacement in a long-running trade war, \"one in which,\" as David Dayen argues, \"for decades, the United States never fired a shot on their behalf.\"\n\nTariffs might not be the answer, but they reflect an increasingly desperate attempt to break the stranglehold on a system which increasingly focuses less on \"free trade\" per se and more on simply privileging oligarchs and entrenching the powerful multinational corporations at the expense of everybody else. An increasing focus on local content rules might represent a more effective response than tariffs of helping to re-establish more domestically oriented supply chains, and reversing the adverse impact of offshoring. It would also deter governments from seeking to monopolize particular industries, and deter firms from offshoring based on labor arbitrage. This eliminates bubbles driven by overinvestment (Asia) with profits recycled as consumption elsewhere, because governments, unable to deindustrialize their trading partners, have little incentive to overinvest in industry and dump the products to drive others out of business. And for its part, the private sector will invest only in response to actual or projected demand.\n\nIn any event, new proposals have to be found to arrest the ongoing erosion of the living standards of the middle and working classes, lest this trade war, like a real war, goes global.", "If you or I got slapped with a $5.1 billion dollar fine, it would likely be a bit of a problem. That's the number handed down to Google from the European Commission (EC) for what it calls illegal practices used to strengthen its internet search dominance through the Android mobile operating system. For Google, it'll smart a bit having to hand it over, but with its cash reserves, it could pay up and forget all about it.\n\nHowever, while the fine -- the largest the European Commission has ever given -- captures headlines, it's the changes to Google's practices the Commission is forcing that will have a far longer lasting impact, and may seriously change Android and the way it's used around the globe. While Google will be anxious, rivals are pleased with the decision because it presents them with an opportunity that hasn't been forthcoming. Which is actually the Commission's point.\n\nWhat does it all mean for you? Your next Android phone may not be the quite the same as it was before, and that's a good thing.\n\nThe end of an era\n\nWhat happened? The EC found three areas where Google broke antitrust rules in Europe. The first is forcing companies that want to use Android and pre-install the Google Play Store to include its Chrome browser and Google Search apps, and not install alternatives. The second is illegally paying device makers to exclusively pre-install Google Search. Finally, preventing companies from using other, competing forked versions of Android if they are also selling Google's Android on other devices. It's Google's way, and that's it.\n\nAll this \"cemented the dominance of its search engine,\" said EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, and \"denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits.\" Google makes its money through ads, and a lot of crucial data comes from search. Google has 90 days to stop these practices deemed illegal by the EC, or face a daily fine of five percent of Alphabet's annual turnover. Alphabet is Google's parent company.\n\nGoogle's dilemma\n\nIf you're Google, then it's a serious blow. CEO Sundar Pichai has written a lengthy defense of Android and its business model, saying it actually promotes choice, and that the decision will upset the \"balance of the Android ecosystem.\" Pichai warns that it's this business model that has stopped Google charging fees to use Android, or tightening controls over the distribution model.\n\nWhile Android is technically open source and anyone can use it, it's only the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that's truly free. To install Android with Google Play and other Google apps, there are rules to be followed, and acceptance by Google.\n\nThe EC's plan is to put an end to this, but it's leaving it in Google's hands to work out how. \"It's Google's sole responsibility to ensure compliance,\" it writes, and adds the decision is not made to, \"prevent Google from putting in place a reasonable, fair, and objective system,\" that stops Android from functioning, or Google services from operating. Like Braveheart, the EC has painted itself blue and is shouting, \"freedom!\" At Google, the doors to Android have got to open a little wider.\n\nRivals rejoice\n\nPoor Google, right? Told what to do by the evil commissioner. Turn to the reaction from competitors, and you'll begin to understand why it's Google and Google alone that will be most upset by the decision.\n\n\"We welcome the EU cracking down on Google's anti-competitive search behavior. \"\n\nPublic policy head for Yelp, Kostas Rossoglou, tweeted, \"Competitors, phone manufacturers, consumer groups, SMEs all applaud EU Android decision.\" Oracle Vice President Ken Glueck's quoted as saying it will, \"undoubtedly unleash more choice for mobile customers ... more opportunities ... and more robust competition.\"\n\nHowever, both Oracle and Yelp are known Google detractors, so such a response is to be expected.\n\nSimilarly, the privacy-focused search engine company, DuckDuckGo, tweeted:\n\n\"We welcome the EU cracking down on Google's anti-competitive search behavior. We have felt its effects first hand for many years and has led directly to us having less market share on Android vs iOS and in general mobile vs desktop.\"\n\nAnd Mozilla's Chief Operating Officer, Denelle Dixon, emailed Digital Trends a statement.\n\n\"We are hopeful the result will help level the playing field for mobile browsers like Firefox, and to foster openness that creates and sustains competition and innovation.\"\n\nWe won't suddenly lose the ability to use Google apps, access the Play Store, or enjoy Android.\n\nIt's these firms and many more that sense a considerable opportunity here. European consumer organisation BEUC tweeted that it agrees with the assessment that Google abuses its power, and this, \"restriction of competition hurts European consumers.\"\n\nNot everyone is on the side of choice, with many of the hundreds responding to Vestager on Twitter questioning the decision. This professor and former European Union think tank member argues, like Pichai, that Android promotes competition, lowers prices, and avoids the Apple walled-garden scenario. Are they wrong? Yes. When has competition been a bad thing?\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen?\n\nWe don't know what Google is planning yet. However, we won't suddenly lose the ability to use Google apps, access the Play Store, or enjoy Android. When Microsoft was put in a similar situation with Internet Explorer on Windows, it offered a \"browser ballot,\" at startup, allowing you to choose which browser you wanted to install and use. Google could potentially do the same with Chrome and its Search app. Perhaps the familiar Search bar will be a widget only, rather than being automatically placed on the home screen, and be flanked by other search widgets.\n\nPerhaps Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, or any other companies may decide to release a phone with Amazon's Fire OS, or even produce and release a device with their own Android alternative. Like Tizen once was for Samsung. All of the above will still also carry on using Android -- because why wouldn't they -- but we could see the scourge of bloatware increase with such freedom. But that's what the uninstall option is for, and they're going to get hammered for doing it in reviews too.\n\nChange is coming\n\nUltimately, at this time, we will probably just get more choice of software and potentially hardware too. The great thing is, if the alternatives are rubbish, we don't have to use or buy them. Google will still be there, just in a slightly more open way. In all this is the chance we'll try something new, and perhaps discover a decent alternative, for example. How can that be bad? It's not, unless you're Google being forced to change something that has made it a lot of money, and given it a massive amount of power and influence.\n\nSome alterations are coming to Android devices in the EU over the next 90 days.\n\nNightmare scenario? That Google starts charging device makers for Android, they refuse to pay, and we end up with operating systems designed by manufacturers, which have always been universally awful. This is incredibly unlikely, because everyone will simply buy an iPhone instead. Remember, Google will almost certainly be looking over its shoulder at Apple whilst deciding a course of action here.\n\nPichai said Google will appeal the EC decision, which may change everything again, depending on the outcome. However, what we can be certain of is some alterations are coming to Android, at least those devices sold in the European Union, over the next 90 days. What we shouldn't be is mad about it. Google's getting the bad end of the deal, not us.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Google's $5.1 billion anti-trust fine could mean the end of free Android European Commission may slap Google with a game-changing fine over Android Oracle persuades Australia to examine Google's data-tracking practices What is a Smart TV?

Everyone", "Now that we know the Galaxy Note 9 has an official Aug. 9 launch date: Aug. 9, we can really dig into the rumors of how Samsung's next big phone could wow us ...or disappoint. Let the real speculation can begin.\n\nThe Galaxy Note, which is designated by its trademark digital stylus, represents the culmination of Samsung's technology for the year. The Note is usually the phone that Samsung saves its best technology for, in order to battle the iPhone and Pixels, and thrust in front of buyers when the holidays roll around.\n\nRumors are still a jumble at this point -- will the Note 9 have an underscreen fingerprint reader or won't it?! -- but what is certain is that the Galaxy Note 9 will need to progress beyond the already excellent Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus if it's going to.\n\nThe juiciest rumor by far points straight at the Note's signature detail, the thing that makes it different and more powerful than any Galaxy S phone: the S Pen stylus. One leaker claims that theNote 9's S Pen is going to finally learn some skills that go beyond writing, drawing and navigation.\n\nKeep reading for my thoughts, plus the best rumors that are building ahead of the official Note 9 launch. Check back often! This list updates as quality new rumors emerge.\n\nRead: Six things the Galaxy Note 9 should have\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published June 13 and updates frequently.\n\nEarlier this week, the always prolific, mostly accurate leaker, Evan Blass tweeted a pic of what is supposedly the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Front and back!\n\nBeyond the expected dual camera array and rear-mounted fingerprint reader, of note (heh) is the S-Pen stylus. It's yellow, which actually contrasts nicely with the blue body of the phone in the pic. And makes sense given the invite pic used for Samsung's upcoming Aug. 9 Unpacked event.\n\nThe rumors were spot on. Samsung's \"Unpacked\" launch event will take place on Aug. 9 in Brooklyn. I'd say there's a 99.99 percent chance that the device in question will be the Note 9 that launches Aug. 9. Nice symmetry, eh?\n\n9/9 at 9 a.m. would have been even better, but with the iPhone launch typically around the same date in September, playing chicken with Apple is risky business. Samsung wouldn't dare put itself in a position to lose that popularity contest. Typically, Samsung likes its Note phones to go on preorder well before Apple even announces its next round of iPhones.\n\nAug. 9 is early for a Note launch, which usually happens at the end of the month rather than the beginning. Last year's Note 8 was announced Aug. 23. But, there is some precedent for an early unveiling. The Note 7 unveiling took place Aug. 2, 2016. Critics pointed fingers at the rush job as one reason that Note 7 units literally burst into flames.\n\nWe'll try not to draw too many parallels about the early Note 9 launch.\n\nUnfortunately, the invitation doesn't provide a heck of a lot of clues about what we'll see inside the phone. It focuses on a button, rendered in a yellowy gold color. This could be a button on the side of the phone, or it could show a close-up of the S Pen stylus itself. Mysterious, indeed...\n\nThat the Note 9 will be called the Note 9 isn't necessarily a given.\n\nJust because the last phone in this series was the Note 8 and the one before was the Galaxy Note 7 doesn't mean Samsung wouldn't skip a number to rename its phone. Samsung did skip 2016's Galaxy Note 6 in favor of the Note 7 name; some suspected it was to match up numerically to the iPhone 7.\n\nBut one indication that Samsung's sticking with the classic progression comes from frequent gadget leaker Evan Blass, who tweeted that the Note 9's model number is SM-N960U and its internal name is Crown.\n\nThe Galaxy Note's built-in stylus draws and writes with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. It also helps keep your screen clean by navigating you around. The S Pen is already a smart pen that's rumored to get smarter with the Note 9, but not just because it's a pen.\n\nAccording to Twitter leaker Ice Universe, the Note 9's S Pen will be a Bluetooth-connected device that will be able to serve as a remote control for other functions that have nothing to do with writing. For example, maybe you'd be able to click the pen to take a photo when your phone's on a tripod, or advance your musical track.\n\nI'd be happy if Samsung made the top of the S Pen pressure-sensitive enough to erase mistakes, like you would with an analog pencil. (Cue the \"back in my day\" diatribe.)\n\nWhatever Samsung does with the S Pen, it will be critical that the action isn't easy to accidentally trigger. Because that truly would be annoying.\n\nDual cameras on the Note 9 are pretty much a sure bet. The Note 8 was Samsung's first phone to add portrait mode, and the Galaxy S9 Plus has the setup, too. Samsung's moving forward here, not backwards.\n\nAn image from OnLeaks and @91Mobiles shows a Galaxy Note 9 with side-by-side cameras instead of a vertical stack as we see on the S9 Plus. (For more on cameras, scroll to the wish list below.)\n\nGoogle has embraced the trend of Android notches, but that doesn't mean Samsung will. The cut-out screen design gives you a \"larger\" screen to work with by extending the sides of the screen up around the cut-out where the camera lens, speaker and other sensors live.\n\nBut there's an extremely high chance that Samsung will keep the Note 9 notch-free and instead use the Note as a way to mock the iPhone X and other notched Android phones.\n\nAfter all, the notch was an important part of a recent Samsung ad that slammed iPhone speed, and Apple's flock in general.\n\nThat said, a patent application does exist for a Samsung phone with a notch design. Then again, so does a notch-less one, with holes cut into the display instead of a screen cut-out.\n\nThe Galaxy Note and Galaxy S phones have been safe so far, and Samsung execs have publicly stated that they're proud of the headphone jack. Samsung also typically ships its AKG wired earbuds along with the Galaxy phones inside the box.\n\nOne rumor from German site All About Samsung suggests that the Galaxy Note 9 could come in black, grey, lavender (similar to the Galaxy S9's \"lilac purple\"), bright blue and brown. Some of these shades could have iridescent qualities like the Galaxy S9 phones and other Samsung models.\n\nBased on past Galaxy phones, I think it's a pretty good guess that the Note 9 will maintain the glossy finish Samsung seems to savor, one that can alter the phone's color when you turn it in the light.\n\nHowever, the current word is that Samsung's pulled the feature for now, and will save the in-screen fingerprint reader (now reportedly an ultrasonic fingerprint reader for the Galaxy S10. That would be a shame, since the Note series typically leads the way with Samsung's new features.\n\nOn the flipside, Samsung can't afford the embarrassment of a mistake if the in-display sensor isn't secure enough for reliable enough for daily use. Ultimately, having this feature work well is better than being among the first.\n\nRumors back up the physical fingerprint sensor living below the camera. The prolific Ice Universe tweeted that the Note 9 and Note 8 will look almost indistinguishable, and also posted a leaked case that'll allegedly fit the Galaxy Note 9 that features a cut-out for a rectangular fingerprint reader, Samsung's preferred shape. Keep in mind that a case maker could easily create renders based on rumors and speculation; this isn't necessarily the real deal.\n\nStill, centralizing the fingerprint reader would be a good decision, and one that would overwrite the Note 8's most annoying and unnecessary design flaw.\n\nThe other feature guaranteed to put the Note 9 up in lights is also the least likely by far.\n\nWe know that Samsung's working on a foldable phone, and has gone far enough to apply for a patent on a few design scenarios. I'd be stunned speechless if that were to actually happen (for the record, rumors suggest we won't see a foldable phone from Samsung until 2019).\n\nIn a nutshell, it isn't Samsung's style to take such a huge risk on its Note phone. The tech giant is far more likely to launch a separate foldable phone to test the waters and gather feedback for working out kinks.\n\nSamsung has long cited Galaxy Note users as among its most loyal, and any issue with a foldable Note could permanently alienate buyers who have already been burned by the Note 7 fiasco.\n\nSo what could the Note 9 look like? The Note 8. Speculation points to a Galaxy Note update that's got similar dimensions and design to last year's model, but again, with a fingerprint reader that sits below the dual camera array, not off to the side as it does in the Note 8.\n\nA possible render of the Galaxy Note 9 shared by mobile tipster Ice Universe suggests that the Note 8 and Note 9 are virtually indistinguishable, adding that the new Note could be 2mm shorter than the Note 8.\n\nSamsung's Bixby software is now a fixture on the company's high end Galaxy phones, which means its presence is a foregone conclusion even if the head of Samsung Research's AI Center hadn't said we'd see an upgraded version on the next flagship phone, whether you wind up disabling Bixby or not.\n\nBixby could pick up better natural-language processing, improved noise cancelling and faster response times.\n\nRemember that Bixby 2.0, the current version, isn't just for Samsung phones. This is Samsung's vision for its entire ecosystem of devices, similar to the way that Google Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa AI sidekicks push into the home through smart speakers and other devices.\n\nI'd expect to see the Bixby button return to the left side of the Galaxy Note 9, and I'd be overjoyed if Samsung let you program this key to do something other than open Bixby, though I seriously doubt this will happen.\n\nRead: 10 Bixby tricks you need to know\n\nBy the time we think the Note 9 will launch, it'll have been almost a year since the iPhone X debuted with FaceID, and still no direct competitor to challenge Apple's secure level of face unlock. The Note 9 would be Samsung's chance to respond.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 phones and newer give you a few options for unlocking your phone with your face, but only one of them, iris scanning, is secure enough for mobile payments. That's a pretty good bar as these things go.\n\nIris scanning harnesses a different technology than Apple's FaceID, which uses a 3D front-facing camera and 50,000 infrared dots to map your face and verify that you are you.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 9 represents an opportunity for Samsung to pop in a 3D camera, too, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor that I expect Samsung to use (the Galaxy S9 already does) supports Applelike technology.\n\nThere's little doubt that Samsung and others will want to use a 3D camera, but after losing a lawsuit and being forced to pay Apple $539 million for patent infringements, I can't blame Samsung for wanting to tread carefully.\n\nGawd, I hope so. Samsung made 3D avatars first, through its AR Emoji feature in the Galaxy S9 camera. But the unsettling images creeped us out and Apple's new Memoji avatars in iOS 12 are already better at some important things.\n\nSamsung can work to fix AR Emoji in two ways. The first is through software fixes that add more customizations. The second is if that Note 9 gets a 3D camera, which would give Samsung's emoji-creating engine more data to grab on to when it scans your face to make your avatar.\n\nRead: How the Galaxy S9's worst feature was made by Oscar winners\n\nSorry, but it's a given. Google's Android P software update doesn't even have a name yet -- it'll become Android Popsicle or Pudding or something by the time it arrives on its first phone later this year, most likely in fall around the time that the Google Pixel 3's announced.\n\nBut the Galaxy Note 9, and a heap of other Galaxy phones, including the S9 and S9 Plus, are sure to get the final Android P software in the following months. Unfortunately, Samsung isn't known for particularly timely Android updates.\n\nSamsung's industry-first dual-aperture lens on the Galaxy S9 will surely come to the Note 9 as well, but I think the company could take the technology a step further by bringing dual-aperture to the front-facing camera as well.\n\nThe aperture helps determine how much light your photo gets, and generally speaking, the more light you get in, the better. A dual aperture front-facing camera could help automatically make selfies brighter, even without a flash blinding your eyes.\n\nHopefully Samsung will also fix the Galaxy S9's camera app, which too easily switches between camera modes when you don't intend it to.\n\nSamsung plans to upgrade the Note 9's camera, according to Bloomberg.\n\nPhones aren't getting cheaper. In fact, the Galaxy Note 8 cost significantly more than the Galaxy Note 7 in some markets.\n\nWe can expect the Galaxy Note 9 to hover in the same ballpark as the Galaxy Note 8, though prices could creep upwards on account of the dual-aperture camera.", "Codenamed \"Winner\", Samsung's foldable phone has success baked right into the name.\n\nMore details of Samsung's rumored foldable phone for 2019 have trickled out: It may be codenamed \"Winner,\" and when folded have cameras on the back and a small display in front.\n\nThat news comes from an unnamed source, speaking to the Wall Street Journal. The source reiterates previous rumors we've heard: It will be a seven-inch model and arrive in early 2019, which means a launch could coincide with Mobile World Congress. The official name is reputed to be \"Galaxy X.\" Because X marks the marketing spot these days.\n\nSamsung is in competition with Huawei to the finish line in the race to release such a foldable phone. Samsung Mobile President DJ Koh has gone on the record to talk about the company's plans for a foldable Galaxy phone and has previously told reporters to expect a folding phone as early as this year.", "ASML Holding NV, a supplier of equipment to the world's biggest chipmakers, reported better than expected second-quarter earnings and said it expected an even-stronger performance for the rest of the year.\n\nThe bullish forecast from the Dutch maker of lithography systems used by Intel, Samsung, and TSMC to lay out semiconductor circuits, may assuage concerns that demand for memory chips is waning, or that US tariffs on China are undermining customers' confidence.\n\nThe company reported net income of 584 million euros (S$928.3 million), up from 466 million euros a year earlier, as sales surged 30 per cent to 2.74 billion euros.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters forecast sales at 2.56 billion euros and net income at 524 million euros.\n\n\"After an excellent first half of 2018, we expect the second half to be stronger, with improved profitability and continued growth from Q3 to Q4,\" said CEO Peter Wennink in a statement.\n\nMr Wennink added that he expected that trend to continue in 2019.\n\nASML has high visibility on its business as chipmakers must plan carefully where its machines - which cost roughly 100 million euros each - are placed in semiconductor fabrication plants, many of them based in Taiwan.\n\nASML said it had received net bookings worth 1.95 billion euros during Q2 and forecast net sales of 2.7-2.8 billion euros for the third quarter.\n\nDiscussing the chip market, Mr Wennink said the company shipped one more of its newest, most expensive machines, during the quarter than it had expected.\n\nCustomers making logic chips, used to power the brains of computers, smart phones and tablets, are preparing \"for the ramp of next...(generation) devices starting later this year\", he noted.\n\nASML repeated its forecast that it will sell 20 of the newest machines this year and 30 more in 2019.\n\nIt said that memory chip makers, who buy marginally less advanced machines, continue \"to require a significant number of lithography systems at least throughout this year and into 2019\".\n\nMr Wennink said demand from logic and memory chip makers seems to be in balance. REUTERS", "BRUSSELS -- The European Union fined Google a record $5 billion Wednesday for forcing cell phone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google apps.\n\nThe EU said the practice restricts competition and reduces choices for consumers.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal. Android has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said the Mountain View company broke the rules when it required smartphone makers to pre-install the Google Search and browser apps if they wanted to use Google's app store. Google also paid big producers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said \"companies must compete on their merits,\" playing by rules that favor consumers and open markets, and not restrict competition.\n\nVestager said that given the size of the company, the fine is not disproportionate. The penalty is on top of a $2.8 billion penalty that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nThe latest fine is well within Google's means. Its parent company, Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and reportedly had over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\nBut the EU's insistence that Google change its practices could have a bigger impact than the fine itself.\n\n\"The important thing is not to be distracted by the size of the fine. What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" Rich Stables, CEO of rival search engine Kelkoo, told the Associated Press.\n\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that Google lets cell phone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating even Apple's iOS. The EU says Google has market share exceeding 90 percent in most European countries.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing and allow for competition in services such as internet searches. It also wants cell phone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android.\n\nGoogle argues that could hurt its ability to provide Android for free, as its main way of making money from the operating system is through advertising and the sale of content and apps. Its main rival in mobile systems, Apple, makes most of its money from the sale of devices.\n\nGiving phone makers more freedom to use altered versions of Android could also hurt Google. Samsung, a popular maker of Android devices through its Galaxy line, could break off and take much of the Android system with it.\n\nIf Google's business activities are too harshly constrained, the argument follows, it might no longer be able to provide Android for free to cell phone manufacturers.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, said the ruling \"is a blow to innovative, open-source business models.\"\n\nThe EU's clash with Google is reminiscent of the bloc's battle with Microsoft. In that case, the EU said Microsoft used the market dominance of its Windows operating system to lead consumers to use Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft was fined and in the end was forced to give users a more explicit choice of browsers.\n\nAs technology's impact in modern life spreads, European regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the industry. European governments tend to want to exert more control than the U.S.\n\nThe difference in approach was highlighted after a scandal over the misuse of millions of Facebook users' personal data in political campaigns, including the 2016 White House contest. European regulators had already been working on tougher privacy regulation and in May enforced new rules that are influencing the way some companies operate outside of the region as well.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with import duties on American goods. The U.S. is now also considering taxes on imports of European cars.\n\nThe U.S. also has complained that the EU has mainly targeted American companies -- including also Apple and Amazon -- for breaking competition or tax rules.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"", "Prime Day has officially ended, but there are still a handful of deals available.\n\nAmazon Prime Day 2018 has ended -- and it was apparently Amazon's biggest blockbuster sale ever. The 36-hour sale officially ended at midnight PT (3 a.m. ET), so you're out of luck if you wanted a nice price cut on Bose headphones, Toshiba's Fire TV or the Instant Pot slow cooker That said, we're still seeing a handful of straggler bargains.

As of Monday, July 16, here's what you can get:\n\nThe Echo Show for $130. That's a full $100 off the regular price and the biggest discount to date for Amazon's screen-equipped smart-home companion. The certified refurbished version is also available for $20 less. Read CNET's Amazon Echo Show review.\n\nFree PC games from Twitch. Amazon already gives Prime subscribers free games every month. In the run-up to Prime Day and for a couple days after, it's giving away a different game every day. Many of the previous ones are still available -- but they won't be much longer, so hurry up. Today's entry: The puzzle-adventure game Hue.\n\nThree months of Kindle Unlimited for $1. Normally $10 a month, Kindle Unlimited lets you read all the books you want, though from a relatively modest library of about 1 million titles. Take note, too, that this is for new subscribers only, and after the first three months, you'll automatically get billed at the standard rate unless you cancel.\n\nFour months of Amazon Music for $1. Another extended trial for newcomers only, Amazon Music rivals Spotify and similar services by offering unlimited access to some 40 million songs. After your first four months, you'll get billed at the standard $7.99 monthly rate unless you cancel.\n\n$2 movie rentals. Amazon has a smattering of newer movies you can rent, via Prime Video, for $1.99 apiece. The titles include Hostiles, Downsizing and Wonder.\n\n3 months of Audible for $4.95 per month. The standard subscription rate for Amazon's audiobook service: $14.95 per month. Right now, Prime subscribers can get the first three months for $4.95 each, a total savings of $30. Interestingly, there's nothing to indicate this is for new subscribers only, so if you've tried Audible in the past, you may be able to get this deal.\n\nYou can get discounts on other items as well. For example, some of Amazon's Everyday Essentials brands have been marked down by 30 percent. You can also save up to 25 percent on select furniture and home decor products.\n\nPrime Day deals revealed early. Amazon just lifted the curtain on some of the deals that will be available when the event kicks off.

Yep, you'll get a $10 Amazon credit when you spend at least $10 at the Amazon-owned grocery chain. Thankfully, you don't need to have an Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card to score this perk. Just scan the Prime Code in your Amazon or Whole Foods app when you check out.\n\nHuawei phone deals. If you're in the market for a new phone, Huawei has a pair of deals lined up for Prime Day: The Honor View 10 for $399 ($100 off) and Honor 7X for $169 (a $30 savings).\n\nNvidia Shield TV with remote for $139. The jack-of-many-trades Nvidia 4K streaming box is currently $179, but on Prime Day you'll be able to snag it for $40 less. Read CNET's Nvidia Shield review to learn more.\n\nSave 25 percent on a Yubico YubiKey 4. It looks like a flash drive, but this USB security key adds an extra layer of protection to your PC. Just plug it in and tap the gold button to gain access. The YubiKey 4 normally runs $40, but it'll be $30 on Prime Day.\n\nSamsung Connect Home smart Wi-Fi system 3-pack for $99. Lowe's will offer up to 60 percent off select smart-home products, including this mesh-network combo, which normally runs $300. It earned a 4.5-star average from Lowe's customers, but read CNET's Samsung Connect Home review for a deeper dive. (Interestingly, price was one of the biggest complaints... but you can't complain about $99!)\n\nTarget deals on July 17. Not to be left out, Target will run a one-day sale on dozens of items. For example, if you spend at least $100, you'll get a free six-month subscription to grocery-delivery service Shipt. You'll also save up to 30 percent on select Google products and 30 percent on Target-exclusive home brands.\n\nSave 25 percent on a Roccat gaming headset. The Roccat Khan Aimo is a surround-sound USB headset for gamers. It's normally $120, but on Prime Day you can use promo code 25PRIMEDAY to save 25 percent.\n\nPurify your air for less. The Blue Pure 121 is a compact, attractive air-purifier that normally sells for $350. Starting July 17 (and not July 16 like many Prime Day deals), it'll be 20 percent off -- so about $280. That's an all-time low; it's never been below $300.\n\nThat's it for now -- check back soon for additional deals as we find them!\n\nBack in 2015, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary with a full day of discounts -- not just on Amazon-branded products, but on tens of thousands of other items as well. It was moderately successful -- OK, it was wildly popular -- despite some hiccups.\n\nIn the years since, Amazon has worked to make more products and more inventory available (so items wouldn't sell out in minutes) and simplify the means of finding sale items.\n\nJuly 16. It was just announced and, get ready for this, this year it expands to 36 hours (!) and goes global. Australia, Singapore, Netherlands and Luxembourg join the Prime Day fun this year.\n\nIn years past, Prime Day has fallen sometime in mid-July. Last year, for example, it was July 11 -- though in 2017 it actually started the day before and lasted a total of 30 hours. (It's kind of like the way Black Friday now starts on Thanksgiving Day or even earlier.) \"Prime Day Plus,\" anyone?\n\nTrue to its name, Prime Day is for Amazon Prime subscribers only. If you're not a paid member, you can't take advantage of the deals. Note, though, that Prime Day is merely one of several advantages of being an Amazon Prime member.\n\nAs you may have heard, the company recently raised its annual Prime rate to $119. That's now the price for newcomers and existing subscribers alike. Ah, but will Prime Day bring a Prime subscription deal? Read on.\n\nThere's little question that Prime Day will bring deals on many, if not most, of Amazon's branded products: Fire TV ($70 at Amazon.com) devices, Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers and of course every Echo speaker.\n\nBeyond that, look for a Black Friday-style assortment of deals in pretty much every category. There will undoubtedly be a few standouts: In 2017, Amazon offered sweet deals on a Motorola Moto G5 Plus ($220 at Amazon.com) phone and a 55-inch 4K TV with built-in Fire TV, for example. But don't get too carried away -- many of the discounts are no better than what you'll find in the average Amazon Gold Box daily deals.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nOn the internet, every day is Black Friday -- and Cyber Monday, and Prime Day. That means you should approach every deal with some skepticism -- or at least a little bit of research.\n\nOne great place to start: CamelCamelCamel, the site that tracks Amazon price histories. (It can also notify you when Amazon products go on sale; here's how to use it to track Amazon Echo deals.)\n\nBefore you pull the trigger on any Prime Day deal, copy the URL, paste it into CamelCamelCamel's search field and check the results. You may discover that the product has indeed been priced lower in the past, and therefore may be again.\n\nAt the same time, consider using a browser plug-in such as Honey, which can instantly inform you if any third-party sellers have the same product for a lower price (which doesn't happen often, but it's worth checking).\n\nFinally, be sure to check other sites. Best Buy, Walmart and other major stores usually trot out their own answers to Prime Day, offering loss-leader pricing on popular items.\n\nRead more: How to make sure that Prime Day deal is really a deal.\n\nAs noted, you can't -- but you might be able to game the system a little. For starters, if you've never subscribed before, you can get a free one-month Amazon Prime trial. Sign up right now and you'll be able to shop Prime Day during the trial period.\n\nIt's even better if you're a student: Amazon has partnered with Sprint to offer college students a free six-month trial.\n\nFinally, be on the lookout for a Prime subscription deal in the days leading up to Prime Day. Although it's questionable whether Amazon would offer such a deal so soon after enacting a rate increase, Prime Day's very existence is to help attract new subscribers. Thus, something like an $89 rate for new subscribers wouldn't be unthinkable.\n\nLooking for even more info on Amazon Prime Day?

Those are all stellar games, and you'd almost certainly be buying at least one of them with the Switch anyway, so you're basically getting it for half off.\n\nRemember back in the day, when you could get a year of Xbox Live Gold for $40 pretty much any time you wanted? Well, Microsoft's kicking it old school right now, so re-up your membership at this price while you can, even if it won't expire for awhile, because it's almost definitely not going to get cheaper than this any time soon.\n\nAnker's \"official\" Prime Day deals are gone now, but you can still take advantage of their Kinja Deals reader exclusives, listed below.\n\nThere are too many deals to list them all here, but you can find them all at this post.\n\nThis 4TB desktop hard drive from WD dropped to $80 for Prime Day, and amazingly enough, it's still on sale for that all-time low price. Because this is a desktop drive, it'll need to be plugged into an AC outlet to function, but you can't do much better than $20 per terabyte.\n\nFull of lunch boxes, food jars, and other items for kids, this Gold Box is meant for parents who are Back to School shopping. But there are some items that could be good to take to the office too. This Thermos 32 oz Element has a wide enough mouth so you can fit in ice cubes, plus it has never been cheaper. This sale ends at midnight, so pick up what you need before it ends!\n\nIf you thought the end of Prime Day meant the end of microSD card deals for awhile, think again. This 256GB Samsung U3 card just dropped to $90, the first time it's ever sold for under $100. If you buy a Nintendo Switch today, you should buy this too.\n\nIf you're ready to make the leap to a projector-based home theater, but your budget is tight, you won't find a better value than this $400 ViewSonic.\n\nToday's deal is $10o less than you'll find elsewhere around the web, and a great bargain for a 1080p projector with a respectably bright 2200 lumen bulb, which is plenty bright to enjoy your home theater in the daytime, especially with the curtains drawn. Just note that it's only available today, and could very well sell out early.\n\nIf that won't be quite enough for your, this 4K ViewSonic with a 3500 lumen bulb is still on sale for $1,000, the same price as Prime Day.\n\nHike into this Amazon sale on camping gear featuring big name brands like Camelbak, Igloo, Zippo, Stanley and more. Most things are discounted around 30%.\n\nThere's a lot to look through, so if you're looking for suggestions, I like this rugged Igloo cooler (only $15), this CamelBak hydration vest is marked down to just $63 (down from $90) and this $9 Zippo flex neck lighter is a no-brainer. And there's more where that came from, head over to Amazon to see it all.\n\nDJI's Spark quadcopter arguably offers the best combination of ease, image quality, and price out there right now, and you can grab the Fly More combo from Amazon right now for $499.\n\nThe Spark is roughly the size and weight of those cheap toy drones you see out there, but with significantly better flight time and performance, an automatic follow-me mode, and most crucially of all, a gimbal-stabilized 1080p camera that shoots some seriously great footage. The combo includes an extra battery, propeller guards, a charging hub, and crucially, a high-powered remote control with range of over a mile, compared to ~100 yards with just your smartphone.", "Pok\u00e9mon Go has caused stampedes on the streets of Taiwan and pandemonium in New York's Central Park.\n\nIn fact so powerful is the pull of Pikachu and friends it is even being felt on London's AIM market.\n\nOkay, the impact is one step removed from actually finding a Caterpie, Metapod or Butterfree on steps of the London Stock Exchange's Paternoster Square HQ (although I'm reliably informed they are there if you look).\n\nNo, the Pok\u00e9 poke, if you will, is being felt by one of the junior market's constituents, a firm called Bango, which processes payments for premium additions to the game.\n\nBango wagon: Pok\u00e9mon Go has caused stampedes on the streets of Taiwan, in fact so powerful is the pull of Pikachu and friends it is even being felt on London's AIM market\n\n'We started to detect a spike in activity last month in Australia and New Zealand,' says Bango's founder and chief executive Ray Anderson.\n\n'In a few days it started emerging as a worldwide trend.'\n\nIt is too early to say whether the spike in payment activity will have a material and sustained impact on the business, just as it was difficult to predict the financial effect of games such as Clash of Clans and Candy Crush in their early weeks and months on sale.\n\nHowever analysts hope there will be a tangible benefit to a business already starting to gain a significant head of steam.\n\nThose familiar with the AIM's technology sector will know Bango has been around quite some time.\n\nThe firm started by providing mobile billing facilities to vendors of ringtones (who could forget Crazy Frog?) and other premium content (it had a deal with Jamster).\n\nThe pivot came four years ago when it identified app stores as the likely primary distribution channel for the emerging areas of games and apps.\n\nApple's App store and Google Play started to emerge as big online marketplaces. The former, in good old Apple tradition, is a closed eco-system, while the latter welcomes all-comers, including Bango.\n\nThe company got its big break by being recruited as the exclusive mobile operator billing service provider for BlackBerry Apps World.\n\nPhones focus: Bango started by providing mobile billing facilities to vendors of ringtones and other premium content\n\nAnd while the fallen Canadian phone titan is now a marginal player in a smartphone market dominated by the aforementioned resident of Cuppertino, California, Samsung and Huawei/Microsoft , this doesn't seem to have held back Bango.\n\nIt has leveraged this unique role to build strong carrier billing partnerships with Google, Amazon, Samsung and Microsoft.\n\nAt the current run rate around a third of billion dollars in transactions is being processed on its billing platform.\n\nAt $500million - and picking up just under 2 per cent of customer end spend - the company breaks even. At double that figure it is significantly profitable and cash generative.\n\nThat's because the incremental cost of adding new customers to its system is small - so this is an operationally geared play.\n\nThe company is at an inflection point, not that the share price fully reflects this.\n\nIt is possible that the rank and file private investors, who drive the valuation day to day, don't really get the potential.\n\nThe institutions, including hedge fund guru Crispin Odey's investment arm, Liontrust and Herald, certainly do.\n\nThey backed the company last November to the tune of \u00a311million. That cash ought to be more than enough to get the firm to break-even and beyond.\n\nBANGO AT A GLANCE\n\nAIM ticker: BGO\n\nMarket value: \u00a357million\n\nShare price: 89p\n\nYear high: 129p\n\nLow: 34p\n\nThe organic growth rate registered in the last trading statement suggests the company may outperform when it updates the market in the middle of next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the acquisition of BilltoMobile in May should have boosted the company's total end user spend in June by around 50 per cent.\n\nIt also provides a significantly increased US presence.\n\nNext year app store spend is estimated to be around $25billion; I'll repeat that $25billion. Remember this was a market that really didn't exist five or six years ago.\n\nAnd direct carrier billing (Bango's speciality, where the costs are added to the mobile phone bill), will grow to around $8billion next year, according to research carried out by Ovum that was commissioned by Bango's closest competitor, DoCoMo Digital.\n\nSo what could derail the business?\n\nWell, impediments to growth are the deals done between the app stores and operators directly that cut out payment companies.\n\nThat said, Bango and its ilk offer a solution when the operator grows and is left juggling multiple direct deals.\n\nNo, the real threats are security ('we pay huge attention to this issue', says Anderson) and the move by the world's e-tailers to a single unified payment system. The latter is unlikely, the Bango boss believes, since payments have remained fragmented for decades and innovation is always adding options.\n\nEarly days: It is too early to say whether payment activity spike will have a sustained impact on Bango, just as it was difficult to predict the early effect of games such as Candy Crush\n\nThe share price is down by around 10 per cent in the year to date, though, since the end of June, when the stock was changing hands for 40p, the valuation has more than doubled.\n\nEven at its current level (89p), the broker Peel Hunt sees the potential for the stock to power ahead based on a price target of \u00a31.\n\nAnalyst Paraag Amin, speaking shortly after the BilltoMobile acquisition, said he expected the firm make its first full year profit in 2018.\n\nThe results next month will give the analyst community the opportunity to adjust its forecasts.\n\nThey will also tell us whether Amin et al's financial analysis is plausible based on another six months of data.\n\nIn July, Bango said annualised end user spend was up 283 per cent, or an 'organic' 143 per cent if the contribution of BilltoMobile is removed.\n\nWith this significant growth potential and the ability to expand capacity quickly and cheaply, it can't be long before Bango starts to register on the radar screens of some the big beasts in the payment sector.\n\n'There could be all sorts of interesting strategic opportunities,' Anderson concedes.\n\nIn the near-term, however, it's all about the Pok\u00e9-mania.", "Swedish striker last played for Manchester United against Burnley on Boxing Day\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic is finally over the serious knee injury that has kept him out of action for almost a year and a comeback for Manchester United is on the cards soon, the striker told Reuters.\n\nThe 36-year-old was speaking following the announcement of a new partnership with technology company Samsung under which Sweden's record goalscorer will test and showcase new products for the South Korean firm.\n\nHaving sustained a bad knee injury in United's Europa League quarter-final against Belgian side Anderlecht in April, 2017, Ibrahimovic last appeared for the Premier League club on December 26 against Burnley.\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic is finally over the knee injury that has kept him out for almost a year\n\nA comeback to the Manchester United first-team is soon on the cards for the Swede\n\nHe was replaced in that game at half-time and has since been confined to the sidelines, but asked when he would be pulling on the famous red shirt again, Ibrahimovic was clear.\n\n'When I'm ready to perform. It's all about that,' he said.\n\nThe Red Devils were knocked out of the Champions League this week by Spanish side Sevilla and have only the FA Cup left to play for in terms of trophies, but Ibrahimovic is raring to go.\n\n'I want to get to the point where I can perform as I haven't been able to take part so much during the season,' he said before hinting at an international comeback for Sweden in this year's World Cup in Russia.\n\nIbrahimovic has not made a first-team appearance since Burnley draw on Boxing Day\n\n'The thoughts are there the whole time, but if I want to, I'll be there,' said Ibrahimovic, who quit the national team after Euro 2016 having scored 62 goals, many of them spectacular, in 116 games.'\n\nAs the English season reaches its climax, managers, players and pundits have been at the centre of storms of criticism on social media in recent weeks, but it is not something that bothers Ibrahimovic.\n\n'If you're that weak mentally (that it bothers you), then you're not the right man for the job. Just ignore those people, avoid it and do what you believe in,' he said.\n\nThe veteran striker has not ruled out representing Sweden at the World Cup this summer\n\nNor is he concerned by speculation linking him to one final lucrative move to China, the Middle East or Major League Soccer in the U.S. when his contract at Old Trafford runs out in June.\n\n'Speculation has been there all my life. It's about focusing on the right things and doing the right things,' he said.\n\n'I still want to play. It's nothing I can decide now, but the idea is to keep playing.'", "The European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine -- it represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google -- the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it would appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behaviour.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the US, which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some US politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and \"should lead US enforcers to protect consumers.\" Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring mobile phone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU gave Google 90 days to come up with remedies that could allow rival search apps and browsers onto more phones. Failure to comply risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine was not disproportionate. The penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favouring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, made $12.7 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has US$102.9b (A$139b) in cash reserves.\n\n\"The important thing is not to be distracted by the size of the fine. What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behaviour,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is an open-source operating system that Google lets mobile phone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS. The EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants mobile phone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nGoogle argues that letting phone makers choose their apps could hurt the company's main means of making money through Android -- advertising and the sale of content and apps. Apple, in contrast, makes most of its money from the sale of devices.\n\nGiving phone makers more freedom to use altered versions of Android could also hurt Google. Samsung, a hugely popular maker of Android phones, could, for example, break off and take much of the Android system with it. Samsung had no immediate comment.\n\nDaniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank in Washington, said the ruling \"is a blow to innovative, open-source business models.\" The main complainant against Google was FairSearch, a Brussels-based lobbying group that has been backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and Nokia. It called the ruling \"an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour.\" European regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser. In 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $20 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the US presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminium this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\" Nakashima reported from Menlo Park, California. Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien in Providence, R.I.; Nick Jesdanun in New York; and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.", "In Android Oreo on Samsung's Galaxy phones, one of the new features included with the update is something called \"App Permission Monitor.\" With this, you can choose to get a notification when applications in the background are using certain permissions (like your microphone, camera, etc.) that you may not be aware of otherwise.\n\nIt's a great tool and can be genuinely useful at times, but for whatever reason, some users have been reporting that Facebook-developed apps aren't showing up here at all.\n\nI checked my Galaxy S9 running Oreo, and sure enough, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram don't show up in the App Permission Monitor list despite being installed on the phone. Daniel here at AC also isn't seeing Facebook in his list but can control settings for Messenger Lite and Instagram. In addition to those, we've also been told that WhatsApp (another Facebook-owned app) doesn't show up in some instances either.\n\nThat may not seem like a huge deal at first, but it essentially means that you have no way of knowing if any of these apps are using things like your camera, location, and microphone at any time in the background.

But it could add to a brewing trade war between Brussels and Washington.\n\nEU anti-trust chief Margrethe Vestager denied anti-US bias, saying she very much liked the US. \"But the fact is that this has nothing to do with how I feel. Nothing whatsoever. Just as enforcing competition law, we do it in the world, but we do not do it in political context.\"\n\nGoogle said it would appeal, adding: \"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.

If they do, advertisers will be drawn to those platforms, too, because the ROIs (returns on investment) are very difficult to replicate anywhere else,\" he said.\n\nThe EU takedown of Google is six to eight years too late, with users paying the price, said Mr Geoff Blaber of research and advisory company CCS Insight.\n\n\"Any action by the EU is akin to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a significant danger of unintended consequences that penalises the consumer. This ranges from increased fragmentation and greater app inconsistency to increases in hardware cost should Google decide to change or adapt the Android business model.\"\n\nLobbying group FairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU investigation, welcomed the ruling, saying it could help restore competition in mobile operating systems and apps.\n\n\"This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android,\" it said.\n\nA third EU case involves Google's AdSense product.

The phone still hasn't surfaced - but it we could finally get a peek at it in 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBefore that, Samsung's 2017 financial report had hinted that the phone would be making its appearance soon, catching the attention of Samsung fans and anyone interested in what the company's engineers could do with a foldable smartphone (emphasis ours):\n\n\"For the Display Panel business in 2018, the company expects OLED to become a mainstream panel in the smartphone industry and will reinforce its competencies in new applications such as foldable, automotive, and IT displays.\"\n\nA lot of phone manufacturers, including Apple, are also said to be creating similar foldable smartphones. But if Samsung stays the course, it might be the first to execute, since it has the added advantage of being the maker of the OLED display that make bendable screens possible.\n\nHere's what we know about the rumored Galaxy X smartphone, reportedly codenamed \"Winner\":\n\nFionna Agomuoh contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nWhen the screen is folded in half \"like a wallet,\" there's a smaller display screen on the front and cameras on the back, according to the Journal.\n\nSamsung's patents and prototypes show a device that either opens and closes from side to side like a book, or horizontally like a notepad. Either way, the fold will make it possible to incorporate bigger display options. It might also give users the option to split the screen into two panels that show different things or show one big picture, similar to what Samsung accomplished with its 48-inch ultrawide computer monitor - but that's still speculation.\n\nDepending on the material of the outside layer, a smartphone that folds on itself could serve as its own screen protector, but the fold might create new issues in terms of durability, as indicated by Samsung exec DongJin Koh earlier this year\n\n\"We want to have a good reaction from customers once the phone is out in the market. But there are still durability issues that we need to address,\" he told reporters at a press briefing at CES in January.It's possible that pushing two screens against each other makes for a harsher impact on collision.\n\nAn additional concern with the amount of screen space is that multiple screens - meaning the ones on the outside and the inside - are more likely to make the battery overheat.\n\nMost smartphone manufacturers have spent years making devices slimmer, and a foldable smartphone could be like adding a layer to a thin phone or stacking two thin phones on top of each other.\n\nThe ZTE Axon M, marketed as the first foldable smartphone, is made of two displays attached by a mechanical hinge - but it's almost 1.5x thicker than Samsung's Galaxy S9.\n\nAnd if the size of the display is comparable to a tablet's, then we can assume the device will be closer in weight to a tablet, too.\n\nNew display technologies tend to make smartphones more expensive: In the past few years, consumers have seen Samsung's curved display smartphones steadily increase in price. The starting price of the newest iPhone, too, has gone from $640 to $1,000, partly because Apple switched from an LCD to an OLED display.\n\nThe multiple screens will also require a larger battery to prevent the aforementioned overheating and more powerful processing chips. If memory and storage capacity increase, that's even more dollars on the price tag.\n\nNew technologies almost always have issues that don't come up until the product is on the market, at which point millions of consumers use it and voice their opinions about things that might have been overlooked in testing.\n\nThere could be a lot of issues with the phone's main feature, its foldable display, but the unique layout will probably also influence a lot of other aspects of the phone, like battery life, memory, and aesthetics, to name a few.\n\nSamsung will probably lose the signature curved-edge display on the Galaxy X, so that it can properly close on itself.\n\nSince the edge display is where shortcuts and quick functions are housed, it might not even be necessary on a screen with more real estate. Plus, as it is right now, the edge display can't be used simultaneously with the main screen; multitasking would be better on a foldable phone.\n\nLimited availability is a tactic that has worked for Samsung in the past: In 2013, Samsung released the Galaxy Round - its first attempt at a smartphone with a curved display - to select Asian markets so it could learn from its mistakes and wow a larger population.\n\nThe following year it released the Galaxy Note Edge, which had a single curved edge. It wound up serving as the blueprint for every curved-display device on the market.\n\nIt's not a bad play, considering the amount of scrutiny the foldable phone will face, but it does mean that our chances of seeing it sooner rather than later are slim, at least here in the United States.", "FILE - This 2017 file photo shows a Google icon on a mobile phone, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)\n\nThe European Union slapped Google with a $5 billion fine Wednesday, alleging that the tech giant has acted in an uncompetitive manner by preloading apps and its services, such as Google search and Chrome browser onto Android phones. But as the specifics of the complaint are being pored over, it's not clear how this will affect the more than 2 billion people across the globe who use Google's Android operating system every month.\n\nAt least in the short term, consumers won't see many changes to the phones in their pockets. For one, the complaint gives Google 90 days to change its practices in Europe. Also, Google has said it will appeal the decision.\n\n[Google's fight with the EU over its $5 billion fine over the bundling of apps on Android]\n\nIf Google is unsuccessful, then there could be some noticeable differences. On a small scale, this ruling could change what apps are installed when Europeans pick up a new phone from the store. What is installed by default is a big part of the EU's complaint, which objects specifically to the automatic installation of the Chrome browser and Google's Play store. (Google already gives people the option to download alternatives to many of its apps, but it may have to make this more explicit.)\n\nThe European Union said in a press release that 95 percent of Android users use Google Search, indicating to regulators that the vast majority of people are not changing their settings.\n\nWhen faced with antitrust charges before, Google has given people the option to choose between services while setting up their phones. An antitrust dispute in Russia, for example, prompted Google to change its design to offer people a choice of search engines when they set up their phones.\n\nThe hope is that unbundling Google's apps from phones levels the playing field for competitors to get their foot in the door -- or rather their app in front of new eyeballs. For consumers, that may mean having to seek out alternatives because there isn't a default option. But, the EU's argument goes, then they may find other products that suit their needs better.\n\nThat idea, however, threatens the very foundation of Android. Right now, Google's Android software is \"open,\" or available to manufacturers for free. At that price, it's obviously cheaper for companies to choose Android than to develop their own system. Google reaps the benefits of those partnerships because its products, such as search, are baked into the software and used by millions.\n\nMaking its platform open to manufacturers, such as Samsung, Huawei and others, has given Android a sizeable lead in the operating system race. Apart from Apple, no company has been able to develop an alternative to Android that competes with that dominance. Worldwide, Android is being used by nearly 80 percent of mobile users, according to StatCounter, a web analytics firm.\n\nGoogle would have to change a lot if it adopted a strategy, for example, more like Apple -- which has a closed operating system -- said Larry Downes, Project Director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy and a columnist for The Post's innovations section. If it adopted that model, it would have to sell the Android operating system to smartphone makers upfront. That cost would likely be passed on to all consumers, he said.\n\n\"If they can't rely on that as a source of money, they'll have to charge for Android and all the software that Google makes,\" Downes said.", "EU regulators slapped Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a massive $5.1 billion USD anti-trust fine on Wednesday. The charge is that Google used the mobile operating platform, Android to bully smartphone makers into using its multitude of services and apps. Officials ordered the $5.1 billion to be placed in a holding account while the proceedings (and any appeals) move forward.\n\nThe gist of the fine is that Google unfairly uses the dominance of its Android mobile OS to urge phone makers like Samsung (KRX:005930), LG (KRX:066570), Sony (NYSE:SNE), or Huawei, to prioritize its search bar, Chrome browser, messenger, and other applications over anyone else's in their stock builds for their phones.\n\nRelated Google Fined \u20ac4.34 Billion by EU for Android Antitrust Abuse\n\n\"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules.\"\n\n-Margrethe Vestager, Europe's antitrust chief\n\nGoogle sees things differently. They plan to appeal the decision which means the case could drag on for years in the courts. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO said the ruling \"misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; to millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones.\"\n\nGoogle's overall stance is that it provides the Android license and dev support completely free and in exchange, it prefers that its search and messaging services are prioritized. Google maintains that Android has allowed more competition in the handset market (hardware) while the EU raises more of an issue with the app and search (software) monopoly it seems to have created outside the iOS family of devices, of course.\n\nPichai vaguely threatened that the Android business model (read: free to license when bundled with Google Play, Google Search etc) may not be sustainable in light of the EU's massive fine. The CEO seems to indicate that prices for consumers may ultimately be hurt which is what you would expect a savvy CEO to do, raise alarm with the public voters who have put the EU officials into power in the first place.\n\nRelated Apple's Share Of U.S. Smartphone Activations Increase In Q2, While Google Captures Two-Third\n\nThere is somewhat of a precedent for this case. The situation is actually fairly close to the 2000s case the EU filed against Microsoft centered around Internet Explorer. The argument was that other browsers were unfairly disadvantaged because IE was bundled with Windows, meaning most users simply used what was provided to them, which is probably fairly similar to how most Android users simply click the existing search bar on the home screen or the Chrome icon.\n\nIn March 2004 M$ was slapped with an $800 million fine, the largest fine ever at the time. Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004 although it appealed the decision all the way to 2009.\n\nToday's fine of $5.1 billion is indeed truly massive and perhaps the largest ever fine levied by the EU, but to put it in perspective remember that Google parent Alphabet, Inc has over $104 billion in cash on hand in reserve so this is hardly an existential threat to the internet search juggernaut.", "This isn't the first we're hearing of a Bixby-powered smart speaker from Samsung. The company is believed to have developed an Amazon Echo rival of its own. The Wall Street Journal reports today that Samsung's Bixby smart speaker is set to arrive in a few weeks. The report even gives us an idea of what this product might cost and what might it be able to do.\n\nSamsung had actually confirmed previously that the smart speaker would be launched in the second half of 2018. We're in the second half of the year now and if the WSJ is believed, the launch isn't that far off.\n\nThe report mentions that it's going to be a bowl-shaped device with legs at the bottom and LED lights up top. Samsung will market it as a high-end music player with smart speaker capabilities, much like Apple's HomePod. A \"sound shifting\" feature will be onboard as well which will direct sound towards the person giving the voice command.\n\nIt's further claimed in the report that the Bixby smart speaker from Samsung is going to cost around $300. This will position it in direct competition with more high-end smart speakers like the HomePod instead of Echo devices which are significantly cheaper. It's expected that this product may be unveiled alongside the Galaxy Note 9 on August 9."]}, "BASF": {"2018-07-18": ["Materialise (NASDAQ:MTLS) announces a proposed public offering of 3M ADS.\n\nIn other news, BASF expands its Materialise 3D printing cooperation and agrees to invest $25M in the company.\n\nMaterialise shares are down 3.5% aftermarket to $12.15.\n\nSee all stocks on the move \"\n\nNow read: Subdued Market Reaction After Recall Studios Above Market Tender Offer For Pulse Evolution \"\n\nSubscribe for full text news in your inbox", "BASF and Belgian company Materialise strengthen cooperation\n\nChemical company invests US$25 million in supplier of 3D printing technologies\n\nBASF is expanding its cooperation with Materialise, a leading supplier of 3D printing technologies.

Even CEO Tig Gilliam is based in New York.\n\nHowever, despite their international credentials, Manchester is described as 'the heartbeat of the operation' by the pair as it houses all the vital head office functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe USP for this recruitment firm is that they only recruit high-level specialist roles, or put bluntly, ones that are hard to find.\n\nDescribed as 'white collar' engineering, they recruit for roles such as project engineers, design engineers and construction managers.\n\nAverage pay rates for this type of worker is around \u00a3500 a day, on a global scale, but they can go up to \u00a31,500.\n\nNES currently has 9,000 contractors working for them.\n\nCoton says: \"We have had contractors that have worked for us for 20 years, some of them stay a very long time and follow us around the world.\"\n\nTo find the best talent and place them into roles the company relies on word of mouth as well as social media sites, such as LinkedIn where they have a reach of 250,000.\n\nBuckley explains: \"Our contractors are our best ambassadors, they could go to a competitor, but if we service them, pay them right and on time and look for the best opportunities for them they are going to recommend us.\n\n\"It used to be all about databases, which is still important, but now there are many more routes to market including utilising your network and social media.\"\n\nWho are their clients?\n\nNES supply staff into some seriously big clients, the most notable being oil and gas company BP.\n\nThey also deal with the likes of American multi-national Exxon Mobil, Baker Hughes, Shell and Norwegian-based oil services company Aker Solutions.\n\nOutside of the sector they also have contracts with manufacturing giant Siemens and chemical producer BASF.\n\nThe choice to diversify the sectors they supplied staff in to came after the 2013/14 fall in oil price.\n\nBuckley said: \"Before that date we were dominated by oil and gas but very quickly we had to diversify.\n\n\"In the last four years we have pursued a very successful diversification strategy.\"\n\nPart of that has been to take over other specialist recruitment companies that already deal in other areas.\n\n\"We have done six acquisitions in the last five years and a lot of them have been in other sectors,\" continues the finance man.\n\n\"The most recent one was in life sciences, which is a real area of growth for us and one that we want to explore further.\n\n\"We have a very tight strategy, we look at many businesses but we want to focus on those that fit our culture.\n\n\"It's a bit like a jigsaw really, we have geographies that we are not in and both oil and gas and non-oil and gas disciplines that we want to be in so if it ticks those boxes we will look at buying them.\"\n\nCoton points out that it is also about finding businesses who are supplying candidates of the same calibre.\n\nThe business model\n\nInterestingly, NES operate on mainly contracts-based appointments. This means that they place people into roles, pay them for the length of the contract and then invoice the client with a margin.\n\nIt is a smart move on several levels, as former Oxford man Buckley explains.\n\n\"The beauty of contract is that you build up a book so you place a man or a woman for 12 months and every month you get money from that. It's great recurring income.\n\n\"If there is a downturn, like we saw in oil and gas, then permanent recruitment dries up because people stop recruiting, but a contractor book carries on, and if anything people switch to contract-based work because they still need people.\"\n\nHowever, in order to cover the cost of paying thousands of contractors each month they needed strong financial backing.\n\nThis came in 2012 when they were bought out by US-based AEA Investors, a New York fund.\n\nIn fact they have just completed a refinancing deal in May where they went out to the market and raised more than $200m from 20 institutions. This includes some UK firms, as they are supported out of Manchester by banks RBS and HSBC.\n\nAsked about the impact of having strong backers, the CFO says: \"Being part of AEA means that we have great terms and we are not just reliant on one lender, so there is good flexibility there.\n\n\"It also means if we spot a brilliant business that we want to buy we can move very quickly.\"\n\nAll of this adds up to a strong financial performance with NES expected to pull in \u00a3900m revenue with year end in October. This equates to \u00a345m EBITDA.\n\nAlthough there's no resting on their laurels, as they forecast: \"We want to get to $100m profit very quickly.\"\n\nAnd it's not the first time people are taking note of their potential.\n\nA winning firm\n\nIn 2012 NES Global won the Manchester Evening News Business of the Year Award for best large firm.\n\nThis meant a lot, especially to local lad Buckley.\n\nThe Man City fan said: \"It was great because we tend to win awards that are recruitment specific so to go against other big businesses and come out on top was incredible.\n\n\"We are a Manchester-based company, and as long as I'm here that won't change, so you couldn't win a better award than from the Manchester Evening News.\"\n\nSo with all this success and progression are they wary of competitors catching them up - especially with being more reliant on open data sources like LinkedIn?\n\nBuckley admits that there are a lot more recruiters out there now because there are low barriers to entry.\n\n\"If you wanted to set up a small, local, niche recruitment company in the UK you can do fairly easily\", he says.\n\n\"However, the beauty of where we are now is that there is significant barriers to entry of the global markets because you have to have the capacity and funding.\n\n\"Of course, we do have competitors, three or four global ones and a few based in the North West but when you look at all the facets of the company - particularly our capabilities - we are number one in the sector by some distance.\"\n\nThere is clearly a certain way that they go about recruitment too.\n\nWhat does it take to work in recruitment?\n\nPassionate about the sector Coton said: \"To be a successful recruiter you need hard work, have perseverance, and the ability to listen to and fully understand all of the other key people in the recruitment process, whether that be the client, the candidate or a line manager.\n\n\"A recruitment consultancy can do more harm than good if they do not represent their candidates in the correct way, and we recognise that we are only as good as the talent that we represent.\"\n\nTo ensure that their staff continue to represent them well - 40 years and counting - they take special care when recruiting into their own business.\n\nThe COO says: \"Our product is our staff, so the investment in that area, in training and development, is massive.\n\n\"Our sales force is the biggest driver of growth so we need to get it right.\n\n\"We take a lot of graduates and people who have done sales or recruitment in a less lucrative sector who are looking for something more professional or high end.\"\n\nNES Global in 2018\n\nToday, NES Global Talent has 750 staff across the world, with 154 of those based in Manchester.\n\nThis is up from 125 last year and includes 32 who have done 10 years service or more.\n\nBuckley adds that they recruit a lot of local staff from around Greater Manchester too.\n\n\"They are local North West-based people but because we are a global business it opens up opportunities that they may have only dreamt of.\n\n\"People who have grown up here in Manchester can suddenly find themselves working in Dubai.\n\n\"We have global systems so my payroll manager, who's from Macclesfield, can easily go work out of Singapore or Perth, Australia.\n\n\"I think there is a lot of personal satisfaction in seeing staff develop and those who might join us straight out of school eventually living the ex-pat lifestyle in places around the world.\"\n\nCoton picks up on this point: \"That is a key part of the culture, the ability to develop, and people join us and progress to take on senior roles at a relatively young age.\"\n\nWith the anniversary in mind, I ask them to elaborate on the culture of NES and why it works so well.\n\nLeamington Spa native Coton said: \"We are very honest and very open - it's a non-political organisation.\n\n\"It is a real meritocracy, people are given a great chance to develop and succeed and that's incredibly important.\n\n\"We really want to make it a great place to work.\"\n\nThis includes an annual glitzy awards ceremony where staff nominate 16 winners including best employee and best salesperson.\n\nThe firm flys in around 100 people for the event which they believe drives real value in terms of staff motivation.\n\n\"We have a work hard, play hard ethic. It is a good place to work and we try to reward people for longevity,\" finishes Coton.\n\nThe future\n\nNaturally, that leads to the question what's next?\n\n\"We want to become a true multi-sector global staffing company, that's a key part of our vision\" says the COO.\n\n\"There will be more investment into life sciences, renewable energy and chemicals which are related sectors where the skills are quite similar.\"\n\nTurning to tech they say the advancements have mainly been focused on systems and support but that innovations around apps and chatbots are being explored.\n\n\"From a front-end perspective, we have just invested in a new management information system, which is a lot more high tech because we know you have to invest to stay ahead of the times.\"\n\nHowever, despite fears around cyber security, which they are combatting with an on-site team of specialists, the truth is that they believe recruitment is still a people business.\n\n\"While we may use technology as best as we can to make our processes more efficient we don't see recruitment as an industry that's going to be taken over by technology,\" Coton explained. \"You can't lose that personal touch, basically.\n\n\"A high amount of work goes into paying and invoicing, we are paying 9,000 people every month and that's where the technology comes in and that's where we have invested the time. But a lot of what we provide our clients can only be gleaned from an actual conversation.\"\n\nIt's great to think that 40 years on from those humble days, they may have a global team, working in a bigger marketplace and be on track to make tens of millions of dollars - but they still have to hammer the phones day in day out just the same way their founders did all those years ago in Northenden.", "Fisher has substantial stakes in several ETFs/ETNs and hundreds of very small positions. They together account for more than one-third of the 13F portfolio.\n\nThis article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Kenneth Fisher's 13F stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Fisher Asset Management's regulatory 13F Form filed on 07/09/2018.

Coatings based on this technology have excellent adhesion and greater heat resistance compared with solvent-based coatings. Owing to the stringent VOC emission regulations, regions such as Europe and North America are reducing the use of solvent-borne coatings and have shifted toward eco-friendly waterborne coatings.\n\nThe coating amount required for passenger cars is less as compared with LCVs, buses, and trucks. However, the production of passenger cars is very high as compared with other vehicle types all over the regions. The passenger car coating market is also driven by the increasing sales of premium and luxury vehicles as these vehicles are equipped with bigger engines, best-in-class interior components, AMTs, and bigger wheel rims as compare to conventional cars.\n\nThe automotive industry in the Asia Oceania region has been dynamic over the past few years and has seen an increase in the annual production of passenger and commercial vehicles. Vehicles that are produced in the Asia Oceania region are mostly small cars, which are equipped with small engines, average interiors, manual transmission and small wheel rims, which require very less coating amount as compared with other regions.\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\nPPG BASF Axalta Akzo Nobel Sherwin-Williams Kansai Solvay Covestro DOW Chemical KCC Nippon Paint Kangnam Jevisco Chembond Chemicals Clariant Nsp Coatings Oerlikon Metco Berlac AG Decc Company Hexion Lord Corporation Electro Tech Coatings\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Research Methodology\n\n3 Executive Summary\n\n4 Premium Insights\n\n5 Market Overview\n\n6 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Applications\n\n7 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Technology\n\n8 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Resin Type\n\n9 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Substrate\n\n10 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Electric and Hybrid Vehicle\n\n11 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Ice Vehicle Type\n\n12 Automotive Specialty Coatings Market, By Region\n\n13 Competitive Landscape\n\n14 Company Profiles\n\n15 Appendix\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dsnpsw/global_automotive?w=4\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180718005334/en/", "The \"Middle East & Africa Steel Wires Rope Market , Companies Profiles, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast to 2025\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nIn this region, the Middle East & Africa steel wire ropes market was valued at USD 754.1 million in 2017.\n\nThe Middle East & Africa steel wire ropes market is segmented on the basis of application, material type, distribution, type, and geography.\n\nBased on application, the market is further segmented into oil & gas, mining, structures, industrial & crane, fishing & marine, elevator and traction mast.\n\nOn the basis of material type, the market is segmented into galvanised wire rope, stainless steel wire rope, and others.\n\nOn the basis of distribution, the market is segmented into galvanised direct sales and distributor.\n\nOn the basis of the type, the market is segmented into left regular lay, left lang lay, right regular lay, right lang lay and alternate lay.\n\nBased on geography, the Middle East & Africa steel wire ropes market is segmented into 4 geographical regions:\n\nSaudi Arabia UAE Kuwait South Africa\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\nAarti Industries Limited Akzo Nobel N.V.

The agreement signed Tuesday in Tokyo by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and European Council President Donald Tusk will eliminate 1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, in tariffs that European companies pay per year.\n\nOnce the treaty takes effect in 2019, it will lead to an increase in trade of 16 percent to 24 percent, according to estimates from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. Regional producers of food products, which are subject to especially steep tariffs in Japan, are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries. Japanese carmakers will also benefit from a reduction in tariffs that have helped prevent Toyota from being anywhere near as big in Europe as it is in the United States.\n\n\"It's a light in the increasing darkness of international politics,\" Tusk said of the trade agreement. \"I'm absolutely sure you know what I mean.\"\n\nIt's a big deal for Antonio Fagundo, chief executive of Masaltos, a small shoe company in Seville, Spain. The business, founded by Fagundo's parents, sells shoes that look like normal footwear but add several inches to the wearer's height. (Masaltos is Spanish for \"taller.\")\n\nThe new trade pact will eliminate levies that add 50 percent to the price of Fagundo's shoes in Tokyo. That will make it easier for Masaltos to compete with local products.\n\n\"We are going to be able to grow much more quickly,\" said Fagundo, who sold about 500 pairs of shoes in Japan last year -- a significant number for his small company. He expects that number to double once tariffs disappear.\n\nThat, and growth in other export markets, will allow Masaltos to add three workers to its existing staff of 13, Fagundo said. That may not sound like much, but the city needs all the jobs it can get. The region is still recovering from an economic crisis that began a decade ago.\n\nFagundo is watching Trump, however, with concern. \"I don't know why he's doing it,\" Fagundo said of the president's trade war.\n\nTrump, after placing levies on steel and aluminum from the European Union, is poised to put tariffs on imported vehicles -- a measure that could cost the EU economy hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe European Commission has already responded to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs by penalizing U.S. products like motorcycles and orange juice. There will be more retaliation if the auto tariffs take effect, Malmstrom, the trade commissioner, has said.\n\nBy opening up new markets, Europe wants to at least lessen the blow. But Schmieding of Berenberg estimated that, if the European Union succeeds in negotiating a spate of trade deals, they would add up to maybe one-third of the U.S. market. Trade between Europe and Japan is only one-fifth of Europe's trade with the United States.\n\nFagundo, the shoemaker from Seville, also sells his products to American customers online and has not had any problems yet. But he is hedging his bets.\n\n\"If the United States becomes more difficult,\" he said, \"we have to focus on Asia.\""]}, "Apple": {"2018-07-18": ["Buybacks are accelerating this dynamic and as one strategist reminds you, this is \"formulaic\" in nature.\n\nThe positive results seem to have emboldened many to continue the Strike which in our belief has made inertia an increasingly powerful force in the capital markets.\n\nThat's from one my all-time favorite analyst notes released last October by, of all people, Wells Fargo.\n\nThe bank's point was that passive investing has begun to resemble \"QE for U.S. stocks\". Much as central bank asset purchases entail the sequestration of bonds on CB balance sheets, passive investing effectively amounts to money going in, but never coming out. Here's another excerpt from the Wells note:\n\nCurrently, the shift to Passive is coinciding with ever higher equity prices with many equity indices trading at or close to all-time highs. As QE seemed to exaggerate trends in the fixed income markets, so it appears that Passive equity flows are exaggerating stock movements.\n\nRecently we've observed consistent net inflows to Passive Equity funds, which have morphed into a type of Black Hole. Money goes in and never comes out (as least for now).\n\nIn conversations with clients around the time that note was released, the bank observed a creeping tendency for active investors to simply quit trying when it comes to outperforming benchmarks which never seemed to fall.\n\n\"To fix this issue, they've decided to all together stop, or dramatically slow, their selling\", Wells went on to write.\n\nAround the same time, Goldman noted that hedge fund portfolio turnover hit an all-time record low in Q3 2017, seemingly lending credence to the \"sellers' strike\" theory advanced by Wells Fargo.\n\nThis dynamic was in some ways Howard Marks's \"perpetual motion machine\" taken to its logical extreme. Regular readers are familiar with that concept. Last summer, Marks described how passive investing can drive benchmarks perpetually higher, in a self-feeding loop. In the same memo, Marks suggested that smart-beta products effectively supercharge the dynamic. Here are the key excerpts:\n\nImportantly, organizers wanting their \"smart\" products to reach commercial scale are likely to rely heavily on the largest-capitalization, most-liquid stocks. For example, having Apple in your ETF allows it to get really big. Thus Apple is included today in ETFs emphasizing tech, growth, value, momentum, large-caps, high quality, low volatility, dividends, and leverage.\n\nThe low fees and expenses that make passive investments attractive mean their organizers have to emphasize scale. To earn higher fees than index funds and achieve profitable scale, ETF sponsors have been turning to \"smarter,\" not-exactly-passive vehicles. Thus ETFs have been organized to meet (or create) demand for funds in specialized areas such as various stock categories (value or growth), stock characteristics (low volatility or high quality), types of companies, or geographies. There are passive ETFs for people who want growth, value, high quality, low volatility and momentum.\n\nThat feeds on itself. As Goldman detailed in an infamous June 2017 note, the type of factor crowding described by Marks was leading to a scenario where tech was becoming synonymous with low volatility. To wit, from Goldman's piece:\n\nMechanically, we expect that as the realized volatility of a stock drops, more passive \"low vol\" strategies buy the stock, pushing up the return and dampening downside volatility.\n\nWell, that reinforces the whole dynamic. It's self-referential in the extreme.\n\nMarks revisited all of this in a memo out late last month. You can read my full take on his latest here, but the following passage will suffice for our purposes:\n\nThe more a stock is held in non-index passive vehicles (smart-beta) receiving inflows (ceteris paribus, or everything else being equal), the more likely it is to appreciate relative to one that's not. And stocks like Amazon that are held in a large number of smart-beta funds of a variety of types are likely to appreciate relative to stocks that are held in none or just a few. What all the above means is that for a stock to be added to index or smart-beta funds is an artificial form of increased popularity, and it's relative popularity that determines the relative prices of stocks in the short run.\n\nGetting back to the Wells Fargo note mentioned here at the outset, these dynamics put active investors in a bind. If they sell, they exit the perpetual motion machine and invariably underperform. But by not selling, they join that same perpetual motion machine. That only makes that machine stronger and thereby makes it even more impossible for any one active manager to go against the grain and sell. The result: selling becomes anathema, something close to a logical impossibility.\n\nIn a testament to how this can perpetuate itself, just 10 stocks accounted for more than 100% of the S&P's (SPY) first half gain this year:\n\n(Goldman)\n\nIn the latest edition of BofAML's Global Fund Manager survey, \"long FAANG + BAT\" was again identified as the most crowded trade on the planet by fund managers with more than a half trillion in AUM. That's the sixth month in a row at the top of the most crowded trade list.\n\nOk, so why bring all of this up again? Well, because Wells Fargo is out with a new piece which bears special mention, and not only because it provides a fresh take on all of the above.\n\nThis week, Netflix (NFLX) - which accounted for 15% of the market's return in the first half of the year - stumbled, raising fresh questions about what happens to the broader market when the highfliers get tripped up.\n\nAdditionally, the new Wells note is called: \"The Marginal Investor Remains Supportive Of Tech & Momentum\". Does that ring any bells for the Heisenberg crowd? It should, because I've penned two posts over the past week for this platform that seek to address the \"marginal equity bid\" question (the latest piece is here).\n\nIn his note (dated July 15), Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey identifies buybacks and passive equity flows as \"the two most important and influential marginal\" bids. He takes a look at the numbers on those sources of equity demand, but I've been over that and you already know the story: buybacks and passive flows have been a critical driver for markets over the past several years.\n\nWhat I want to emphasize here is what Harvey says about the dynamics at play. After noting that equity passive funds (including ETFs, sector funds and US-based international funds), saw a net inflow of $135 billion in the first half of this year, Harvey says the following:\n\nHere are some additional numbers related to Passive. At the end of Dec '16, the Tech sector garnered $0.19 for every dollar that went into an S&P500 index fund (and that doesn't include the AMZNs or the NFLX). As of Friday the 13th , July 2018, for every dollar that's investing into an S&P500 index fund Tech garners $0.26.\n\nThat's the \"perpetual motion machine\" in action. Here's a simple chart of tech's weight at the index level:\n\n(Wells Fargo)\n\nIn case what's going on here still isn't clear enough for you, Chris goes on to spell it out in the most explicit terms possible:\n\nThe prominence of Momentum strategies and Passive has coincided. What connection do we see? Well, Passive buys more of what has worked and less of what's not working. Sounds a lot like Mo'.\n\nAgain: This is the perpetual motion machine dynamic at play right before your very eyes, and to truly appreciate how mind-bogglingly self-referential it is, do note that momentum is a \"factor\" (figuratively and literally). In other words, passive investing has started to approximate a momentum strategy and that's driving up some of the names that end up in momentum products. Flows into those momentum products mean more money goes into the same stocks, and around and around we go.\n\nBuybacks serve to turbocharge this even further. As Harvey goes on to write, \"S&P 500 net buybacks in 1Q18 amounted to more than $150 billion and net buybacks in Tech accounted for more than a third of all 1Q18 net buybacks.\"\n\n(Wells Fargo)\n\nIt would be impossible to overstate how laughably self-referential this is. I don't want to go so far as to call it \"artificial\", because unlike Howard Marks, I'm not sure that's the right characterization. It just kind of \"is what it is\" (to employ an overused colloquialism).\n\nBut you should be aware of the existence of this loop because it is most assuredly responsible for at least some of the gains you're seeing in the individual names that are shouldering the entire burden (and then some) when it comes to keeping the broader market afloat.\n\nLet me just close by quoting Harvey one more time, because Chris needs for you to understand that this isn't really a debate - it's just how the market works these days:\n\nThe anticipated outperformance of Tech and Momentum is just a function of index dynamics, historic flows and the scope of Tech buybacks. These formulaic market buyers and dynamics won't last forever but they are too strong to ignore in our view.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

It has been in talks with manufacturers from Huawei to Samsung about that.\n\nThe ruling creates \"a huge opportunity,\" Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief operating officer, said Wednesday.\n\nIt's also possible not much will change. Google Search, Chrome and the Play Store are popular with consumers and developers. Handset manufacturers could choose them despite unbundling.\n\n\"It's possible phone manufacturers won't actually take advantage of the newfound freedom they have,\" said Thomas Vinje, lead lawyer for FairSearch, the Brussels-based lobbying group backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and others that was the main complainant in the case. \"It at least opens up the possibility.\"\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe ruling could stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand. Still, some U.S. politicians welcomed it.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and should lead U.S. enforcers to protect consumers. Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nRegardless of the pending appeal, failure to come up with remedies to rectify the behavior after 90 days risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nNeither fine will cripple the company. Google parent Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is technically an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS by a wide margin.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nBoth Amazon and Samsung, maker of the popular Galaxy line of phones, declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nGoogle argues that downloads are easy and while the inclusion of its suite of apps help phones run well out of the box, competitors' apps are a tap away.\n\nIt also argues that not supporting so-called \"forked\" versions of Android ensures a baseline of experience across some 24,000 different models of Android device. Vestager called the compatibility argument a \"smokescreen.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the U.S. presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.\n\n___\n\nNakashima reported from Menlo Park, California. Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien in Providence, R.I.; Nick Jesdanun in New York; and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.", "EBay is one of the online services that have not been taxed by the Revenue Department for overseas transactions.\n\nThe Revenue Department anticipates that 80-100 large foreign-based digital platform operators that render services to Thai consumers will sign up as value-added tax (VAT) registrants in Thailand after the e-business tax comes into force.\n\nThese foreign e-business operators, dominating 80-90% of Thailand's e-business service value, will be willing to register for VAT payment to avoid tarnishing their corporate governance image, said Patricia Mongkhonvanit, principal adviser on strategic tax administration at the Revenue Department.\n\nThe cabinet on Tuesday approved an amended Revenue Code related to VAT collection on e-business operators with a physical presence outside of Thailand but earning income here.\n\nUnder the amended code, foreign-based digital platform operators providing services, including online games, sticker downloads, online advertisements, digital content and online hotel bookings to Thai consumers are liable for VAT.\n\nThese online business operators are required to sign up for VAT payment through the Revenue Department's online system within 30 days of the law taking effect if their income in Thailand exceeds 1.8 million baht a year.\n\nFor hotel booking sites, VAT will be charged based on service, not accommodation, fees.\n\nShe estimates that VAT collected from foreign online business platform providers would contribute 3 billion baht a year to the government's coffers.\n\nVAT collection for foreign online business operators, expected to come into force this year, is aimed at creating a level playing field for local digital platform service providers as they are now subject to the tax if their annual online business income exceeds 1.8 million baht.\n\nTo determine whether foreign-based digital platform providers are correctly paying VAT incurred from income earned in Thailand, the Revenue Department will require local operators who use or purchase their services to report such transactions.\n\nLocal operators are prohibited from claiming expenses incurred from buying products or services from non-VAT registrants in Thailand as tax deductible expenses, Mrs Patricia said.\n\nMembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have introduced VAT on goods and services purchased online, and 50 countries now impose such a tax.\n\nFor the planned revocation of the VAT exemption for online shopping of goods worth less than 1,500 baht bought from foreign vendors outside of Thailand and shipped by mail, the Revenue Department is studying the issue.\n\nThe VAT exemption waiver needs to be studied because it could hurt the trade ecosystem, Mrs Patricia said, adding that it was essential to think about how to handle VAT payments if such an exemption was scrapped, as more than 100,000 parcels a day are gathered at Laksi Post Office before being shipped.\n\nPurchases from foreign e-commerce vendors outside of Thailand are subject to 7% VAT if value exceeds 1,500 baht, but many online operators exploit the loophole by breaking up invoices into amounts below the threshold to skirt the levy.\n\n\"The government needs to collect VAT, as Thais are estimated to spend tens of billions of baht for cross-border digital services and shopping,\" said Pawoot Pongvitayapanu, former president of the Thai E-commerce Association and founder of Tarad.com.\n\nThere are 11 categories of online services not taxed by the Revenue Department, as money paid by Thais is directly sent abroad.\n\nThese are e-commerce businesses such as Amazon and eBay; media and advertising players like Google, Facebook and Line; marketing and other services including Evernote; transport providers such as Grab and airlines; travel platforms like Agoda, Booking.com and Airbnb; Digital content providers like Netflix, Joox and Spotify; software and apps from Apple and Microsoft; games; infrastructure like Amazon Cloud, Microsoft Cloud and Google Cloud; financial services likes PayPal; and gambling.\n\n\"The VAT collection for foreign online operators is a good starting point to help Thailand earn tax revenue from foreign-based digital service providers and is in line with consumer behaviour, as they tend to shop more online in the digital age,\" Mr Pawoot said. \"Such VAT collection could have some side effects but is worthwhile to prevent the country from losing revenue overseas. Thais need to admit that the VAT payment is not for themselves but for our country.\"\n\nThe Revenue Department can cooperate with the Bank of Thailand to track payments for overseas online services and product purchases from credit and debit cards, he said. Companies in Thailand can help withhold the 7% VAT and remit it to the Revenue Department before paying to foreign online service providers.\n\nCountries like Australia and Japan require VAT payment for online services, while India imposes a 6% withholding tax.\n\nPhensiri Sathianvongnusar, chief executive of aCommerce Thailand, Southeast Asia's leading e-commerce solution firm, said the e-commerce tax is aimed at levelling the playing field between offline and online players.\n\nThe VAT collection on foreign-based digital platform providers will be a boon to traditional vendors, she said.", "Earlier this week, a report explained that the App Store is still bringing in nearly double the revenue of Google Play, despite the fact that the Play Store accumulates one twice as many downloads as the App Store.\n\nNow, new research from Creative Strategies dives deeper into how consumers view and spend on the App Store...\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nFirst and foremost, the research - collected from a sample of 800 United States smartphone's users - shows that 20 percent of iOS users \"browse the App Store daily.\" Furthermore, another 32 percent say they browse it weekly. This is compared to 9 percent of users who browse the Play Store daily, and 21 percent who browse weekly.\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, the built-in search functionality in the App Store is not all that popular among users, according to this survey. Just 16 percent of App Store users say they used the built-in search functionality to find applications \"as their primary method.\"\n\nFurthermore, 35 percent of iOS users said they use search on \"occasion\" but generally rely on internet search, such as Google, to locate the apps they are looking for.\n\nSearch as a primary tool to find the right apps does not seem to be very popular. Only 16% of iOS panelists and 18% of Android panelists resort to it as their primary method. When getting into how effective search within the stores actually is, one gets the feeling that there is plenty of opportunity for improvement.\n\n35% of iOS panelists said to be using search on occasion but believe internet search gives better results. 33% use search regularly and find that the results generally match what they want.\n\nWhen it comes to the point of deciding which app to purchase, 38 percent of iOS users say they rely more on the features provided by the app rather than reviews. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Android users cite reviews as the top point in their decision-making process.\n\nInterestingly, when it comes to paid apps, the leading drivers remain the same for both groups but only after the price of the app itself. In other words, great reviews, feature list, screenshots, and app description do not matter if the price is already beyond what the user perceives to be the right price for the app.\n\nLastly, the survey took an attempt at the difference in spending habits between iOS and Android users.\n\nWhen it comes to in-app purchases, neither Android users nor iOS users were averse to in-app purchases, with 56 percent of iOS users and 64 percent of Android users say they \"did not feel like they were tricked into an in-app purchase or subscription.\"\n\nUsers did, however, express concern with subscriptions in general, with 54 percent of iOS panelists saying they would prefer a one-time payment and 47 percent of Android users coming in agreement.\n\nIn terms of advertising, 46 percent of iOS users said they would make an in-app purchase to remove ads, while 38 percent of Android users said they would.\n\nThe true difference between the two platforms, however, comes in the number of paid apps and subscriptions. 45 percent of iOS users surveyed claimed to have five or more paid apps or subscriptions, compared to just 19 percent of Android panelists.\n\nThis data certainly echoes reports in the past that indicate a stark contrast between revenue generation on the App Store and Play Store.

AAPL, -0.55% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.05% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.01% GOOG, -0.24% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.78% and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.30% -- combined are worth $4.095 trillion versus $4.092 for the bottom 282 companies.\n\nAs mind-boggling as that may be, Batnick told MarketWatch that this sort of concentration is normal, pointing out that AT&T and General Motors represented 14.5% of the S&P 500 during their heyday in 1965.\n\nWhat is different today, however, is that all the big players are uniformly tech names.\n\n\"The gains have been extraordinary over the past five years, with Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google growing from $1.2 trillion to near $4 trillion,\" wrote Batnick in a recent blog entry,\n\nIn the two weeks since he posted that, the fabulous five have crossed over the $4 trillion mark. The stupendous growth of the tech giants over the past few years has sparked concerns that the stock market will see a repeat of the dot-com bust from the late 1990s.\n\nBut Batnick dismissed those fears.\n\nThe main difference between then and now is that today's tech rally can be justified by valuations.\n\n\"These five have earned nearly half a trillion dollars over the last five years and are currently trading at 37 times earnings and 5.5 times sales,\" he said.\n\nThe numbers were definitely more inflated two decades ago.\n\nThe big four then -- Intel Corp. INTC, -0.06% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.31% Microsoft MSFT, -0.78% and Oracle Corp. ORCL, -0.53% -- were trading at 100 times earnings and 26 times sales.\n\n\"Am I worried this is a repeat of 1999? Not particularly,\" Batnick said.\n\nSo far this year, Apple has added 13%, Amazon.com has soared 58%, Facebook has rallied 19%, Microsoft has jumped 23%, and Alphabet had surged 15%, outpacing the S&P 500's SPX, +0.22% 5.3% gains and helping the Nasdaq rise 14%.\n\nSue Chang\n\nSue Chang is a MarketWatch reporter in San Francisco.

Political Editor For Dailymail.com\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pointedly defended the system of global cooperation on trade and foreign policy in a direct counter to the Trump agenda in an address to Congress Wednesday - after two days of warm physical embraces with President Trump.\n\nAfter spending time air-kissing, shaking hands and patting President Trump, Macron said it was time to 'make the planet great again,' speaking in English, and earning applause.\n\nDiscussing the Paris climate pact from which Trump says the U.S. will withdraw from, Macron invoked the world's grandchildren and called for 'offering them a planet that's still habitable in 25 years,' to rousing applause in the Democratic minority gathered in the House chamber.\n\nHe also defended the system of global trade, and called for resolving problems through the World Trade Organization - an institution Trump has blasted as unfair.\n\n'We wrote these rules. We should follow them,' Macron told the joint session.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron addresses the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, speaking about the long-standing friendship between the U.S. and France\n\nHe warned against any new Middle East wars - and said France would not pull out of the Iran deal that Trump has derided as the worst deal in history.\n\n'For Iran, our objective is clear,' Macron said. 'Iran shall never posses any nuclear weapon. Not now, not in 5 years, not in 10 years, ne-ver,' stretching out the word for emphasis.\n\nHe said policy should 'never lead us to war in the Middle East.'\n\n'We must ensure stability and respect sovereignty of the nations, including that one of Iran which represents a great civilization,' he said, in reference to the Persian empire.\n\n'Let us not replicate past mistakes in the region,' he said, noting that the U.S. urged nations to joint the Iran deal.\n\n'Let us not be naive on what side. Let us not create new walls ourselves on the other side,' he added, in a possible dig at Trump.\n\nMacron, whose evening State Dinner remarks were in French, addressed the Congress in accented English\n\nPRAY THIS WORKS: Macron's speech was a vigorous defense of the multilateral order the U.S. helped shape after World War II\n\n'But we should not abandon it without having something substantial and more substantial instead. That's my position. That's why France will not leave the JCPOA. Because we signed it,' he said.\n\nHe also called out the 'illusion' of nationalism and made the case against 'fake news.'\n\n'Closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse but inflame the fears of our citizens. We have to keep our eyes wide open to the new risks right in front of us,' Macron said.\n\nAlthough he didn't mention Russia by name, he brought up the 'ever-growing virus of fake news which exposes our people to irrational fear and imaginary risk.'\n\nThen, in a tip of the hat to Trump, he said quipped that he wouldn't claim 'fair copyright for this expression fake news, especially here.'\n\nMacron's speech at times seem intended for an audience of one as he warned the U.S. not to allow institutions like NATO and the United Nations to dwindle.\n\nMacron said the West must respect the stability and sovereignty of Middle East countries, including in Iran, and not repeat past mistakes in the region that could lead to new animosity on the other side.\n\nHand written edits could be seen on the speech delivered to Congress by French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron (front) seen addressing Congress with Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan sitting behind him\n\nHe said that Trump should honor the commitment that the previous administration made to its partners with the nuclear agreement including France, chief-most because it was U.S.-initiated pact.\n\n'But it is true to say that this agreement may not address all concerns and very important concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without having something substantial, and more substantial instead. That is my position,' Macron said to applause. 'That's why France will not leave the JCPOA. Because we signed it. Your president and our country will have to take in the current days and weeks its own responsibility on this issue,' he said.\n\nMacron said he wants to work on a 'more comprehensive deal' based on what he discussed yesterday with Trump - four pillars for a new agreement that spells out the punishment for Iran if it ever develops nuclear weapons and continues testing ballistic missiles.\n\nMacron - whose visit anticipated a Friday visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, called for a 'new breed of multilateralism.'\n\nHe said it should be a results-oriented and a 'strong multilateralism' - in a counter to what some European allies feared were go-it-alone tendencies during the early Trump administration, especially when Steve Bannon was in the White House.\n\nMinority leader Nancy Pelosi, part of his formal escort committee, trailed Macron closely as he strolled through the chamber, ensuring she remained in the television shot.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stood out by wearing a bright pink dress to French President Emmanuel Macron's speech on Wednesday\n\nMacron said it 'requires more than ever the Untied States involvement.\n\n'You are the one now who has to help to preserve and reinvent it,' he told lawmakers.\n\n'We can actively contribute together to building the 21st century world order for our people,' he said.\n\nHe predicted that one day the U.S. would be back in the climate deal despite 'disagreements.'\n\n'So beyond some short-term disagreements, we have to work together. With business leaders and local communities let us work together in order to make our planet great again and create new jobs and new opportunities while safeguarding our earth,' he said.\n\n'And I am sure one day the United States will come back and join the Paris agreement. And I am sure - And I am sure, we can work together to fulfill with you the ambitions of the global compact on the environment,' he said.\n\nRepublicans in the chamber remained seated for that line.\n\nHe sprinkled his remarks with plaudits for democracy, human rights, and shared battlefield sacrifices of French and American warriors.\n\n'Ladies and gentleman, I believe in democracy. Many of our forebearers were slain fighting for the cause of freedom and human rights. With the great inheritance they gave us comes the responsibility to continue their mission in this new century and to preserve the perennial values handed to us and assure that today's unprecedented innovations in science and technology remain in the service liberty and in the preservation of our planet for the next generations,' Macron said.\n\nMacron peppered his speech with historical references and quotes from past presidents, not always attributing them correctly.\n\n'Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,' Macron said, noting it was spoken by Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe party was right, but the speaker was wrong, as President Ronald Reagan once uttered those words.\n\nHe paid tribute to another Roosevelt during another portion of his talk.\n\nWarning of the 'destabilization of our international community by new powers and criminal states,' he warned of the U.S. and Europe turning to 'anger and fear.'\n\n'You can play with fears and angers for a time, but they do not construct anything,' he said. 'Anger only freezes and weakens us and as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in his first inaugural speech is, \"The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.\"'\n\nMacron, followed closely by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy - a guest at last night's state dinner with France - and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, sporting a bright pink ensemble, entered the House chamber to immense applause and received them again once welcomed by House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nPelosi, part of his formal escort committee, trailed Macron closely as he strolled through the chamber, ensuring she remained in the television shot.\n\n'Our two nations are rooted in the soil, grounded in the same ideals of the American and French revolution,' Macron said, talking about the commonalities shared between the nations, explaining why he decided to invite President Trump to the first Bastille Day parade of his young presidency last summer.\n\nAt the top of his remarks, joked about his bromance with the American president, as he remarked on the close relationship between the founding father Ben Franklin and French philosopher Voltaire.\n\nThey were always 'kissing each others'' cheeks, he said. 'It can remind you of something.'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is photographed addressing both houses of Congress on Wednesday. The U.S. Senate sat in chairs in front of U.S. representative in the House chamber\n\nCongress also warmly received French first lady Brigitte Macron, wearing black, as she received a standing ovation as she walked to her seat in the chamber's balcony.\n\nEarlier, President Trump tweeted that he was eagerly awaiting the speech before Congress today.\n\nThe American president, whose schedule is a blank slate today aside from his daily intelligence briefing and a lunch with Apple CEO Tim Cook, offered the French president words of encouragement on Twitter.\n\n'Busy day planned. Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT!' Trump tweeted.\n\nMacron followed up his address, with a number of his own tweets including one that said, 'I don't share fascination for new strong powers and the illusion of nationalism.'\n\n'The United States were among the inventors of multilateralism. You are the ones now who have to stand up and reinvent it,' Macron said.\n\nHe also remarked, 'Let's face it: there is not Planet B,' a line he also used in his speech touting environmentalism.\n\nMembers of President Trump's cabinet are seated with U.S. senators including (from front left) Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Treasurey Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (left) grips the hand of House Speaker Paul Ryan (right) as he arrives on Capitol Hill to give his address on Wednesday\n\nFrench first lady Brigitte Macron is seen standing in the balcony of the House chamber during her husband's address to Congress\n\nBrigitte Macron claps for her husband as she watches French President Emmanuel Macron speak before a joint session of Congress\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke before a packed House chamber Wednesday on Capitol Hill where he spoke of the deep friendship between France and the United States\n\nVice President Mike Pence (back left) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (back right) give French President Emmanuel Macron (center) a standing ovation during his address to Congress on Wednesday\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he's eagerly awaiting his French counterpart's address to the the U.S. Congress today\n\nPresident Trump tweeted that he planned to watch the French president's address, which will be before a joint session of Congress\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nKnife-wielding straphanger threatens family after hitting his son\n\nWatch video\n\nMelania Trump pulls face after shaking Vladimir Putin's hand\n\nWatch video\n\nBrutal bat attack caught on surveillance video in the Bronx\n\nWatch video\n\nVirginia restaurant shames 17 year-old for tipping with quarters\n\nWatch video\n\nAdam Curlykale recovering after having his genitals removed\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist dies after waterfall jump in background of music video\n\nWatch video\n\nCourageous woman hides victim from kidnappers till cops arrive\n\nWatch video\n\nStunning mountaintop scenery of LA's The Enchanted Hill\n\nWatch video\n\nVogue assistant accused of stealing $50K leaves court in New York\n\nWatch video\n\nResponder films Coast Guard helicopter after saving hiker\n\nWatch video\n\nPolice release video of Stormy Daniels' arrest outside strip club\n\nWatch video\n\nWatch Putin's full speech from Helsinki joint press conference\n\nA rare convening in the House of Representatives that Trump has only faced twice since his own election, legislators from both chambers are gathering this morning to watch Macron deliver his remarks.\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte were feted Tuesday on the White House lawn at a distinguished ceremony that featured cannons, a review of the troops and a red carpet.\n\nBoth leaders delivered remarks, Trump sticking to prompter and keeping his short and to the point before remarks from Macron in French that went on for nearly twice as long.\n\nTrump hailed Macron as the leader of 'America's oldest ally' and credited the 'wonderful friendship we have developed over the last year' as a testament to the bonds between the two country.\n\nMacron returned the warm words before turning to global threats such as North Korea and Iran.

France and, with it, Europe and the United States, have an appointment with history. We have but one duty, Mr. President, dear friend, to be at that appointment.'\n\nTalks with Trump on Tuesday became momentarily heated as the U.S. president tore into the existing nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\n'The Iran deal is a disaster. They're testing missiles. What's that all about?' he griped. 'What kind of a deal is it when you don't talk about Yemen and you don't talk about all the other problems that we have with respect to Iran?'\n\nThe president lit into former Secretary of State John Kerry. Trump said that 'despite all of the money that we gave them,' Kerry 'didn't want to discuss it because it was too complicated.'\n\nObama's administration transferred $1.7 billion to Iran, the first $400 million of which was sent over in pallets of cash, after the deal was brokered. The money resolved a dispute between the U.S. and Iran over a failed 1970s arms deal. Iran paid the U.S. for the weapons but the U.S. cancelled the deal and froze the funds after an uprising.\n\n'That's actual cash, barrels of cash. It's insane. It's ridiculous,' Trump claimed Tuesday in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump appeared to be referring to the fact that the first installment of the payment delivered on wooden pallets in foreign currencies order to comply with sanctions the U.S. has on Iran's banking system. He said later on Tuesday that he also heard that the money was delivered in boxes, as well as barrels.\n\n'In barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out -- cash -- they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is - where Iran is involved. They didn't do that,' he said\n\nMacron talked him down by committing to pursuing a new pact after hours of meetings at the White House with Trump that he said ended in a 'common reading' on what is happening in Syria, where the U.S. and Iran both have boots on the ground.\n\nThe U.S. joined France and the U.K. on launching airstrikes against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's government after his latest chemical weapons attack. The measure brought Trump and Macron even closer, with the leaders speaking to each other on the phone regularly in the weeks since.\n\n'In the past, sometimes France argued that it was time to take action against chemical weapons, and it was -- France was not followed by its allies, including the United States at the time. It is not what happened this time. We decided together what was possible and what was not,' Macron said at a joint news conference.\n\nAs for the Iran nuclear deal, Macon said, 'I do not know what President Trump will decide...and it's his responsibility.'\n\nThe French president said he would work with regional powers, including Turkey and the Syria-aligned Russia, for now, to forge a new agreement.\n\n'I believe we can both combine our common views and our differences, because we are not in a vacuum. I always said we should not tear apart the JCPOA and have nothing else,' Macron said.\n\nOn Tuesday night, it was back to pleasantries between the two leaders as they gave a toast at the Trump administration's first state dinner.\n\nMacron, speaking in French, joked how the British burned down the White House, and then how President James Monroe decorated it with French furniture.\n\n'Many comment on our friendship but I think it helps us work toward our goals,' Macron said during the toast.\n\nA HISTORY OF DIGNITARIES ADDRESSING CONGRESS\n\nWednesday's speech by French President Emmanuel Macron will mark the 120th time in U.S. history a joint meeting of the House and Senate has been called so that a foreign leader could address the American Congress.\n\nThat number dates back to December 1874, when Congress hosted King Kalakaua of Hawaii.\n\nThe French general and war hero the Marquis de Lafayette was the first foreign dignitary to address the U.S. House of Representatives, giving a speech on December 10, 1824.\n\nMore recently, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed Congress in June 2016. In September 2015, Pope Francis addressed Congress. House Speaker John Boehner announced his resignation the next day as the Pope's visit symbolized the pinnacle of his Congressional career.\n\nThe last French leader to address Congress was President Nicolas Sarkozy on November 7, 2007, when President George W. Bush was in office.\n\nVery few members of Congress were invited to the state dinner, with the Trump administration deciding against inviting any Democrats.\n\nTypically politicians from the opposing party are invited to state dinners to forge better relations across-the-aisle.\n\nThe only elected Democrat on hand was Louisiana's Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who invited Macron to speak before Congress, did attend the fete, along with Rep.

Recently the agency also widened the range of cases for which it could begin the process of removing foreign nationals to include those whose immigration benefits, such as work status, have been denied.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe measures are likely to disproportionately affect those whose applications require large amounts of supporting evidence, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Employees with H-1B visas -- mostly held by people in the technology, science and medicine industries -- are currently often asked to respond to a request for evidence from USCIS to prove whether they are qualified for their work, or whether their job is considered a specialty occupation, Pierce added.\n\nThe updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency,\" Pierce said. The USCIS in February updated its mission statement to remove reference to the U.S. as a \"nation of immigrants\" and instead included language on \"protecting Americans\" and \"securing the homeland.\"\n\nIn April, the USCIS said it received 105,000 more H-1B applications than it can grant, according to a National Foundation for American Policy report. Still, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and other U.S. tech giants saw an increase in the number of H-1B applications approved in 2017.\n\nThe recent move by USCIS \"creates traps\" for individuals already working legally in the country -- or seeking to work here -- by upping the consequences for clerical errors, said Todd Schulte, president of immigration reform lobbying group Fwd.us, which was founded by technology leaders including Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston.\n\nAnd it could affect more than just tech companies, Schulte said. \"Cracking down on legal immigration is simply this: It's encouraging innovation and job growth to happen someplace else.\" Microsoft Corp. expanded its Vancouver office several years ago, in part due to Canada's more lax visa regulations.\n\nThe updated USCIS policies add a layer of instability for employers. \"There's a chance that not only is the case going to be denied, but also that the beneficiary could be placed in removal proceedings,\" said Hassan Ahmad, managing attorney with the HMA law firm. \"How can you do business with this type of uncertainty?\"\n\nUSCIS spokesman Michael Bars said the policy changes are part of an effort to help \"cut down on frivolous applications, reduce waste, and help ensure legitimate, law abiding petitioners aren't undermined by those able to game our system.\"\n\nThe number of requests for evidence to H-1B visa petitions rose 45 percent for the period of Jan.1 to Aug. 31, 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to a report by Reuters. Given the volume of the requests, \"it may seem like it would be a natural option\" for USCIS officers to want to leverage the new policies to avoid issuing additional RFE's, said Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But without the requests for evidence, applicants don't have an opportunity to explain themselves if they make a mistake that could be as minor as writing their work address incorrectly on an application, she said.", "Make sure you have top-speed broadband, because this autumn is the season of on-demand, with many critics saying we are entering a new golden age of television.

Is it gratuitous? Yes. But you know what? The best violence very often is gratuitous.\n\nAnd besides, if you tune into a zombie horror show like The Walking Dead (see No 41), it's what you expect.\n\nIt stars Britain's Andrew Lincoln as a US sheriff's deputy who wakes from a coma to discover the world has been overrun by zombies.\n\nI got into the show when it first aired back in 2010 and was gripped from the first episode. It's pure escapism. It boasts a top-drawer cast and in Frank Darabont has the most amazing director, who has given the series an extraordinary cinematic feel.\n\nIt's also incredibly well-written - I particularly like the father-son relationship between Rick Grimes (Lincoln) and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs).\n\nI very often watch it with my sons who are just as hooked as me, although I have to confess... my wife isn't the greatest fan. Amazon, Now TV\n\nAndrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes - The Walking Dead\n\nPOLITICAL\n\n52. House Of Cards\n\nThe West Wing meets Macbeth\n\nMuch more than 'just' a US remake of the British TV show, the merciless political thriller is a streaming telly phenomenon.

Netflix (four series, 68 episodes)\n\n65. Veep\n\nAll the vice-president's men\n\nArmando Iannucci's transatlantic smash is less a remake more an adaptation of The Thick Of It with bungling politicians and flunkeys transposed to the US.

Homer Simpson is one of the greatest characters in fiction.\n\nHe's a massively flawed individual who you love all the same. The show's got an unbelievable ability to relate to family life. I am essentially a version of Homer.\n\nMy wife Morwenna is a more responsible version of me who runs the house, like Marge, and we've got two kids - a naughty boy and a good girl.\n\nAll the characters feel real, despite it being a cartoon. One of my favourite Homer moments is when he's given the key to Springfield, the city the show is set in, for clearing the snow.\n\nWhen he gives it back there are teeth marks in it because as it's wrapped in foil he has assumed there was chocolate in it.\n\nThe fringe characters are great too. I am very fond of Chief Wiggum, and Mr Burns is a brilliant villain.\n\nWhen something is very popular it often loses its idiosyncrasy but that's not true for The Simpsons. It's got such an individual voice.\n\n'The Simpsons' is on Sky 1 and Channel 4 David Baddiel's AniMalcolm is out now (HarperCollins, \u00a312.99)\n\nWhen something is very popular it often loses its idiosyncrasy but that's not true for The Simpsons.

It's the best thing I've ever seen on TV, it's worth the entire sub to Amazon Prime,' I say.\n\nThen I explain it's won heaps of awards, has Hank from The Larry Sanders Show in the lead, and after five minutes you're hooked.\n\nYou don't just fall in love with retired prof Mort Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor, below) en route to becoming Maura, you fall in love with a kooky extended family of La La Land narcissists who make your own relatives seem sane, boundaried, gender-defined - and just a tad dull. It's not that the family is charming or cute (they aren't), but they become so real you soon feel you know them far better than your own family, and every line of script is sharpened with an axe.\n\nEven though they are maddening and self-centred, you become addicted, and conflicted, by the Pfeffermans' endless \"issues\" (fights over sex, houses, legacies, boyfriends, girlfriends, exes, birthdays, bagels - everything, basically, on top of LGBT), and seduced by their Jewishness.\n\nTransparent isn't The Waltons on gender hormones. Or Orange Is The New Black not in prison. It's not like anything else.\n\nI wasn't mad about watching an old guy with lank grey hair in a dress 'navigating' his identity issues either. But it's one of those series that doesn't just change TV; it's transcendent, transformative - it changes you as you watch it.\n\nAll three series now on Amazon Prime\n\nTransparent isn't The Waltons on gender hormones.

It's not like anything else\n\nFive of the best - gadgets to watch your on-demand TV\n\nGoogle Chromecast\n\n\u00a330, google.co.uk/chromecast\n\nGoogle's Chromecast plugs into the HDMI slot on the back of your TV, so it doesn't take up space. It allows you to watch any video from any phone app on the screen. You can watch YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and more.\n\nGoogle Chromecast\n\nApple TV\n\nFrom \u00a359, apple.com\n\nApple's TV box has got a lot better but it's still less easy to use than rivals, and a little too keen to sell you video rentals from the pricey iTunes store. You can watch other TV providers by downloading their apps but the box is geared for heavy Apple users who don't mind paying \u00a33.49 a film to rent a new video, and the remote is ungainly.\n\nAmazon Fire Stick\n\n\u00a335, amazon.co.uk\n\nAmazon's Fire TV stick is the size of a packet of chewing gum and plugs directly into your TV, adding iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube, as well as offering hundreds of videos to stream.

You still pay, with a one-month 'pass' to Sky's entertainment channels (home to Game Of Thrones) costing \u00a36.99 but there are no contracts or cancellation fees. The box also offers catch-up services.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick\n\n\u00a330, roku.com\n\nThe Roku plugs directly into your TV's HDMI port and is a favourite with technology fans because it offers apps with Sky's Now TV, Netflix and Amazon Prime, plus 1,400 channels, including catch-up services and YouTube. It's marginally less easy to use than Chromecast but offers pretty much anything you would want to watch.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick\n\nOne word of warning, you'll need a fast internet connection - at least an 8Mb line - to watch shows.\n\nGo to broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk to find out your broadband speed. Most services work via an app that streams shows to your TV, which means you can start watching near-instantly.\n\nMany new TVs offer on-demand functions built-in, but if your TV isn't 'Smart', don't despair. Many DVD and Blu-Ray players will also be able to connect to 'on-demand' services, or you can buy a separate device", "\"It's hard not to get drawn into the broader debate about the strategy Optus took from the outset. In my opinion, they've ended up where they should have started; offering free access to help ease the broader population into the behavioural change of watching live sport on something other than their TV. Even as an avid Liverpool supporter, it took me a season and a half before I finally caved and took out an Optus contract in order to access the Premier League.\n\n\"As for the apology ad, apart from questioning how many people would have actually seen it, running this ad was definitely the right thing to do. Apologise, explain and rectify is the approach every PR company would recommend in these circumstances. However it reads like PR company also wrote the ad. Not only did it lack the charming tone of the UK's KFC 'FCK' ad, the line; \"We're not perfect, but we are big enough to own up to our mistakes' showed they couldn't resist a little self-aggrandisement.\"\n\n\"I respect brands that can admit when they've fucked up. How well they admit it, now that's the true test. KFC's 'FCK' ad is a finger-licking-good example of this; a clever idea that's simply executed and integrates the product perfectly.\n\n\"These recovery-mode press ads from Optus on the other hand, don't quite hit the mark creatively for me because they just sound like a stock standard, corporate apology. The strategic genius is offering all Australians free access to its sports channel for a month. Luring people in with freebies gets them hooked enough that they might stay a little longer. That reminds me, I need to cancel my free Foxtel trial that expired three months ago.\"\n\n\"I wanted to like this. The surreal set and the unconventional voice showed a determination to cut through. But those executional elements aren't enough to sustain the campaign and ultimately it lacks the intrigue of a strong creative device.\n\n\"More concerning is that it feels a little low budget and for a brand that wants me to trust them with my vital statistics and more of my transactions, this is a problem.\n\n\"To reach time poor millennials, I'd be taking a more irreverent, faster paced approach with a healthy dollop of brutal honesty, similar to Fiverr's 2017 campaign (https://youtu.be/g4GWVlHIWxc).\"\n\n\"Holding a mirror up to its audience who are sitting around busily scrolling Instagram, swiping left and exchanging Snaps with each other, is one way to get their attention. It will probably work for PayPal, but I believe these 15-second interruptions could have been better executed. I would have liked to have seen the agency own the theme of laziness and see how far they could push it. Instead, we have a couple of lazily crafted executions.\"\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the first Telstra Thrive ad (https://youtu.be/6zGytq7ckS8) featuring the impassioned voice of Slam poet champion Phil Wilcox and a Flight Facility soundtrack. It felt lush and important yet warm and emotional, even if 'Thrive' felt like a word better suited to the brief than the script.\n\n\"But the re-brand manages to look contemporary and big without chest beating. In this instalment, they've used many of the same quality ingredients but the message that Telstra is the network for Apple lovers gets a little lost. The visual metaphors look great (but I'd question the flash mob) but are too abstract. Compared to the poet's read, I would have loved to hear Thelma covey more emotion and meaning out of her script. The end voice has no idea what he just said.\n\n\"BUT, the scale, music and mnemonic makes it unmistakably Telstra and that's probably enough.\"\n\n\"Something's missing here. I believe it's the lack of a multimillion-dollar production budget, a world-renowned director, a talented famous person and perhaps the highest level of craft involved, that's left us with this pear-shaped attempt of an Apple ad for Telstra.\n\n\"Having worked on a telco before, I'm sure there was a lot of pain involved for the agency, while smiling through gritted teeth. All you can do after this is brush your shoulders off, learn something, move on and forget this ever happened.\"\n\n\"This is a brilliant ad. Unfortunately for LG it's an ad for writer, director, producer Tim Kindler. Yes, the cinematography is stunning and the sparse sound design is perfect. Casting a sultry French voice over was also a good idea on paper, except de in-tree-ca-seas of her accent make it hard to follow and again, she doesn't bring the words to life.\n\n\"I'm aware that my approach to marketing is more pragmatic than most, but this feels very self-indulgent. Because after all that investment in the craft you end up with a film that will do as much for a Kogan as it does for LG.\"\n\n\"I admire when clients are bold enough to try something different and we need it to happen more often. However, like most of those who watched this, I didn't get to see it on an LG OLED TV. Instead, it was on my Apple MacBook laptop, which also acts as my TV, so I think they missed the mark on what they set out to achieve here.\n\n\"Overall, I found this short film a bit random. What I can appreciate though, is the craft. They managed to make the unflattering parts of Sydney look beautiful, design an equally beautiful sound mix and top it off with a seductive French narrator. This concoction had me intrigued for the first 30 seconds, which is a good thing given my short attention span.\"\n\n\"Westpac has done a great job repositioning the brand with the 'Help. It's what Australians do' campaign. The similarities with the NRMA Insurance campaign are unfortunate, but the strategy is sound.\n\n\"So why undo all that great brand building work with such a disconnected radio ad? Even using the Hero's soundtrack would have helped maintain the brand tone and conjure the images from the TVC. Switching saving accounts is a big ask, so why not suggest that by doing so, you're not only getting a great introductory rate, you're helping Westpac help others.\n\n\"But what annoys me most, is that if a campaign like this is deemed to be ineffective, they won't blame the creative, they'll blame radio.\n\n\"Welcome to my world.\"\n\nAhmad says:\n\n\"Do people still listen to radio ads? Clearly they do because I'm judging one. Radio is hard to execute well because we're tapping into people's imagination. But, we've all heard these inception-style ads that hero the disclaimer voice before. Many times. And done better.\n\n\"Is this ad functional? Yes. Did the creatives want it off their desks so they could work on something more juicier? Most likely. Did they think it would get judged on a public forum? Probably not.\"", "Last week Apple introduced new MacBook Pro models and the prices already initiated discussions. Maybe it is still better to build a custom PC for getting the bang for the buck.\n\nWithout a doubt, the newly introduced MacBook Pro and iMac Pro are great computers, but they are not the best. For the last couple of years, upgrading is impossible on MacBook Pros, and this doesn't seem to be changed on the new releases. Also, the pricing strategy on customizing is ridiculous as RAM and hard drive prices doubles when you want to upgrade. Apple is already charging for the base components, however for each upgrade, you need to pay more than the actual price of the component. This has been an Apple classic for a long time, and I don't think even the newly introduced 6-core processors will save the brand's reputation.\n\nBut Wait, It's a Laptop, Not a Desktop!\n\nTo be honest, a six-core processor and a 32 GB of RAM in a laptop is great. But, if you're a professional image creator, you will need total computing power. Therefore, multi-threading performance, clock speed of each core, the power of the graphics card, and the overall cooling performance should be considered. The base specs of a Mac might be sufficient for general Photoshop tasks, but for video rendering, 3D rendering, and some other compositing software, it might be slow. Even Apple is aware of this fact that they even introduced an external graphics card box to accelerate the performance. So, portability is not the case here, it's performance, and when it comes to performance, there are many other options out there.\n\nChoosing the Processor: AMD or Intel?\n\nIf this post was written three years ago, I would recommend Intel. However, AMD has been the game changer recently and their processors are the best in terms of price to performance ratio. The second-generation Ryzen processors are better than the first generation, and they are optimized better for Adobe applications. As AMD boosted the processor race, Intel introduced new processors as well, but with higher prices. Intel also introduced six-core entry-level processors, but not all of them support multi-threading. So for professionals, Intel x299 compatible i7 or i9 processors would be the ideal route. If you are tight on budget, then Intel socket 1151 compatible i7 8700K might be the best option as a six-core processor. If you would like to choose an AMD Ryzen processor, a build with the latest eight-core Ryzen 7 2700x will be cheaper than all Intel alternatives above, considering the motherboard prices.\n\nHere is the current price list for processors and motherboards based on the core count and models.\n\nIntel i7-8700K Processor (6-core) + Asus Prime Z370-A Motherboard: $517 Intel i7-7800X Processor (6-core) + Asus Prime X299-A Motherboard: $660 Intel i7-7820X Processor (8-core) + Asus Prime X299 Motherboard: $760 Intel i9-7900X Processor (10-core) + Asus Prime X299 Motherboard: $1190 AMD Ryzen 7 2700x Processor (8-core) + Asus Prime X470 Pro Motherboard: $485\n\nTo give an average idea for the pricing, I chose the Asus Prime motherboard for each socket type. You can find cheaper motherboards made by different brands. Just make sure to buy the suitable chipset for your CPU.\n\nOther Parts Memory\n\nAfter choosing the CPU and the motherboard, it's time to choose the RAM. Memory stick prices doubled since 2016 and apparently they won't become cheaper soon. Considering a pro workflow, 32 GB of RAM should be the minimum, but if your budget is limited, then you might choose 16 GB for the start. As an advantage of a custom build, you can upgrade the amount of RAM any time. Also, most brands offer lifetime warranty on memory modules, so you can even look for used ones for cheaper price.\n\nGraphics Card\n\nThis is the second most important element of a custom build computer, and powerful graphics card are not for only gamers. They have been turning into general processors and besides accelerating various software like Adobe Creative Suite, they are also being used by GPU rendering software like Octane and Redshift as the main computing unit. For video and VR applications, they are vital elements as well. On the contrary to Apple, you are not limited to AMD Radeon graphics cards on your build. You can pick any Nvidia card, which has the advantage of CUDA cores, a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by Nvidia. Here are some specs and prices for the recent graphics cards for your build:\n\nEVGA GTX 1070 (8 GB): $429 Asus Cerberus GTX 1070 Ti (8 GB): $509 MSI Gaming GTX 1080 (8 GB): $567 Gigabyte GTX 1080 Ti OC (11 GB): $799\n\nYou can find cheaper alternatives in different series and brands, and any option will be smaller, faster and cheaper than Apple's Blackmagic eGPU.\n\nTo complete your build, you will need a CPU cooler, a power supply, an SSD, a case, and a Windows license. You can either use an air cooler or an all-in-one liquid cooling system. Both will do the work, but if you want more silent and cooler operation, it is better to buy a liquid cooler. Ryzen 7 2700x already comes with the Wraith air cooler, so if you choose AMD, you won't need to worry about the CPU cooler at the first step. For the SSD, you can go with the m.2 NVMe SSD, but if the price is your concern, then you should get a standard 2.5-inch SSD. Even if you upgrade to an NVMe drive in the future, you can always use your existing 2.5-inch SSD as a portable hard drive with an enclosure box.\n\nBefore buying a power supply, always check your system's total power consumption. To do that, go to Power Supply Calculator (almost all brands have this calculate sections on their websites), select your components, and calculate. This will give the average consumption in watts and try to add at least 150 watts on that result before buying the PSU. For example, if your system's total power consumption is calculated as 450 W, try to buy at least a 650 W PSU. Also, keep in mind to select 80-plus rated units to get at least 80 percent efficiency.\n\nCase selection is a personal choice and there are hundreds of options in the market. You can even buy a decent case under $50. And with a Windows 10 Pro license, an Intel i7 8700K, 32 GB with the Nvidia GTX1070 TI, the build will cost around $1,700. Even if you add one or two 4K monitors, the total cost will be less than any Mac with similar specs. If portability isn't an issue for you, feel free to build your own PC. If you have been using macOS for long time, Windows 10 won't disappoint you and adaptation will be easier than you think. If you want to learn how to install the components, don't forget to check Lee Morris' PC build guide.\n\nWould you consider switching to Windows and build your own PC? Please share your thoughts in the comments section.", "I am easily a foot taller than Andy Grove. But whenever I was with him, I felt that he was the giant.\n\nThat's what the bestselling Harvard business professor, Clayton Christensen, wrote about the former Intel chief executive when he passed away in 2017. Christensen, who coined the term \"disruptive technology\", said he would most miss Grove's ability to understand how a complex organisation works, and to wield it to Intel's advantage.\n\nIt allowed Grove, who started at the company the day it was incorporated on July 18, 1968, to famously re-orient the business in the 1980s. Intel shifted away from memory chips for mainframe computers towards the microprocessor - the engine that spurs into motion when you turn on your computer.\n\nPropelled by a deal with IBM to put Intel processors into all its personal computers, the company came to provide Silicon Valley with one of its most essential technologies. Intel Inside and the accompanying jingle became one of the most memorable advertising slogans of the modern era.\n\nEven after five decades of dominance, no other company in the world can produce a better and faster microprocessor. Intel is at the pinnacle of an industry that manages to engineer miracles like no other. We tend to perceive innovation as something uncertain, particularly where it's so reliant on scientists to drive it forward. Yet Intel is anything but ambiguous. It has released successive advances in processor engineering like clockwork.\n\nIn 1965, future co-founder Gordon Moore made a bold prediction about the exponential growth of computing power. He predicted that the number of microchip transistors etched into a fixed area of a computer microprocessor would double every two years - and so, therefore, would computing power. Intel has since delivered on this improbable promise, immortalising \"Moore's law\".\n\nIt's difficult for anyone to fathom the effects of exponential growth. But it is why a single iPhone today possesses many times more computing power than the entire spacecraft for the NASA Apollo moon mission of 1969. Without Moore's law, there would be no Google, no Facebook, no Uber, no Airbnb. Silicon Valley would be like any other valley.\n\nThe Big Miss\n\nAnd yet, the iPhone is also what Intel missed. Immediately after the company won Apple's Mac business in 2005, Steve Jobs came asking for another chip for his smartphone. Intel certainly wanted to dominate this emerging sector but the price Jobs was offering was below its forecasted cost and it misjudged the size of the iPhone market. The company passed.\n\nApple had no choice but to build its own chipsets by licensing technologies from ARM, a British-based company controlled by Japanese interests. If Apple and its iPhone had been the only competitors, Intel might have been able to gradually adapt. But Google came in soon after with Android, a free operating system that Samsung, Huawei and HTC all adopted. Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments, all licensed by ARM, became the phone makers' go-to suppliers for energy-efficient, low-cost computing devices.\n\nThese American rivals are not trying to beat Intel. Qualcomm specialises in mobile phones and Nvidia specialises in graphics in video games. They all outsource production to third parties in Asia. But an Intel microprocessor sells for around US$100 while ARM-based chips sell for around US$10, and often less than a dollar. That's how ARM-based designs are now found in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.\n\nIn other words, Intel failed to compete in smartphones against those who have far less resources. It's a great irony when you reflect that Grove once invited Christensen to the Intel HQ in Santa Clara, California, to explain his theory on disruption. Grove later credited the meeting as the main driver for Intel's decision to launch the Celeron chip in 1998, a cheap product aimed at low-end PCs, which within a year captured 35% of the market.\n\nThe New Goldrush\n\nNow the big question is whether Intel is repeating its previous mistake with iPhones - this time in driverless cars. Last March it purchasedMobileye, an Israeli company that makes digital vision technology, for US$15.3 billion. It was a big bet in a sector that has huge potential: as autonomous driving takes off, vehicles are becoming computers on wheels. They will require more and more microchips and Intel hopes to dominate.\n\nExcept for one glitch. Everything Intel has done in the last 50 years is geared towards general purpose, high-end chipsets. Its integrated model - where the company designs and manufactures its processors - means it absorbs an enormous amount of fixed cost, in research and design as well as manufacturing.\n\nThe only way to offset these burdens is to sell a high volume of devices at high margins. The result is that the company is obsessed with technological progress, but has a rigid business model which limits what it can and cannot do. There's a monster inside Intel with a ferocious appetite.\n\nBut what if autonomous driving doesn't actually require the computing power Intel is counting on? This is the competing vision of Huawei. When I recently visited Shenzhen, executives from the Chinese telecom giant explained to me that much of the city's infrastructure will be digitalised and that Huawei will saturate it with a 5G network. This will drastically reduce any speed and latency problems for computers.\n\nThis means the computing inside cars can be mostly offloaded to the city's infrastructure. It is a radical vision, but clearly a viable alternative. The implication is that a BMW or Toyota doesn't need that many high-end chipsets after all. It's smartphones all over again.\n\nChristensen's insight was that successful companies die not because of complacency to change. Kodak, Polaroid, Blockbuster and DEC all understood the shifting landscape.\n\nBut in each case, their business model and the demands of existing shareholders formed an intractable nexus that even the most courageous executives found impossible to navigate. Grove once said, \"only the paranoid survive\". Maybe he was right.\n\nHoward Yu is a Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School\n\nThis article appeared in The Conversation.

Google immediately said it would appeal the fine\n\n\"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google spokesman Al Verney said in a statement. \"A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition. We will appeal the Commission's decision.\"\n\nDanish former minister Vestager spoke by telephone with Google chief Sundar Pichai on Tuesday night to tell him about the decision in advance.\n\nVestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser, thereby freezing out rivals.\n\nThey were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. Google Search and Chrome are as a result pre-installed on the \"significant majority\" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says. Google also prevented manufacturers from selling smartphones that run on rival operating systems based on the Android open source code, it said.\n\nGoogle finally gave \"financial incentives\" to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they pre-installed Google Search on their devices, the commission said.\n\nGoogle provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.\n\nUnder EU rules Google could have been fined up to 10 percent of parent company Alphabet's annual revenue, which hit $110.9 billion in 2017.\n\nVestager's campaign against Silicon Valley giants in her four years as the 28-nation European Union's competition commissioner has won praise in Europe but angered Washington.\n\nBrussels has repeatedly targeted Google over the past decade amid concerns about the Silicon Valley giant's dominance of internet search across Europe, where it commands about 90 percent of the market.\n\nAs well as the Android and Google Shopping files, it also has a third investigation under way, into Google's AdSense advert-placing business.\n\nVestager's other major scalps include Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe EU ordered Apple in 2016 to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes that the maker of iPhones and iPads had avoided by a tax deal with Dublin.\n\nIt has also taken on Facebook over privacy issues after it admitted that millions of users may have had their data hijacked by British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nBut Brussels has had US tech giants in its sights for a decade in a half, since it imposed a huge 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive behaviour and ruled it must make changes to its Windows system.\n\nThe Google decision comes just one week before European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to travel to the United States for crucial talks with Trump on the tariffs dispute and other issues.

One of the first ones up is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), which is scheduled to release results after market close on Thursday, July 19.\n\nThe stock has steadily climbed higher over the past several months and is up about 22 percent year to date, slightly below its recent all-time high of $106.50 on July 17.\n\nExpectations are on the high end for tomorrow's report, evidenced by the run-up in the stock and a number of analysts upping their price targets over the past few months.\n\nFor the quarter, MSFT is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.07 on revenue of $29.2 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. In the prior-year quarter, the company earned $0.98 on revenue of $24.7 billion. MSFT has beat earnings estimates in each of the past 8 quarters.\n\nAs has been the case for some time, the company's cloud products and services are the primary focus among analysts since they've been delivering MSFT's fastest growth. When MSFT last reported, revenue in Office 365 Commercial was up 42 percent year over year, Dynamics 365 was up 65 percent and Azure was up 93 percent.\n\nMSFT also just announced it would acquire software development GitHub for $7.5 billion, with the deal expected to close later this year. On tomorrow's earnings call, management might provide some commentary about how they envision GitHub folding into the rest of their cloud businesses.\n\nPositive PC trends are a factor that some analysts think could have helped boost sales across a variety of MSFT products and services this quarter.

All rights reserved.", "AppleInsider has both an i7 and i9 2018 MacBook Pro on hand, and it's time to do our own testing on the thermal throttling situation that positively afflicts the i9 model -- at least at launch.\n\nIntel's 2.9GHz six-core Core i9 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.8GHz is offered as a premium $300 option on Apple's 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but according to Lee, the chip is unable to reach its full potential due to the laptop's design.\n\nIn a video posted to his YouTube channel on Tuesday, Lee shows the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro running Adobe Premiere Pro at surprisingly low clock speeds. Tests conducted put the average clock speed of the processors under load at around 2.2GHz, well below the advertised 2.9GHz.\n\n\"This i9 in this MacBook can't even maintain the base clock speed,\" Lee said. \"Forget about Turbos and all that stuff, it can't even maintain the 2.9GHz base clock, which is absurd. This CPU is an unlocked, over-clockable chip, but all of that CPU potential is wasted inside this chassis, or more the thermal solution that's inside here.\"\n\nThe internet's reaction to Lee's findings was about as expected. The Thermal Design Point (TDP) is defined by Intel as the \"average power the processor dissipates when operating at base frequency with all cores active under a high-complexity workload.\" In short, it advises of how hot a processor can get when running at un-boosted capacity, and how much in the way of cooling systems a device manufacturer has to put in place to mitigate the generated heat. More on \"unboosted\" in a bit.\n\nProcessors are created to run at a variety of different TDP levels, depending on their intended market. Processors meant for desktop computers can afford to have a higher TDP, while notebooks, mobile devices, and tablets tend to use processors with lower TDP values, due to the difficulty of cooling the chip down.\n\nAccording to Intel Ark, the processor manufacturer's specifications website for all of its chips, the 2.9GHz Core i9-8950HK has a TDP of 45 Watts, the same TDP as the Core i7-8850H and Core i7-8750H. The TDP itself is low, so it shouldn't require an excessive amount of cooling, and with identical TDPs across the board, this means that Apple could add the same cooling system across the board, regardless of selected processor.\n\nNotably, the 45-Watt TDP of the three processors used in the 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro line is the same as for the 3.1GHz Core i7-7920HQ, the processor used in the 2017 MacBook Pro.\n\nWhile a processor is cool, it will exceed its normal operating clockspeed up to its boost speed. This generates more heat, of course.\n\nAs that heat builds, the processor will slow down to help dissipate the heat in conjunction with the cooling system. It can even go lower than the normal operating clockspeed if need be to prevent damage.\n\nThis is why Lee was seeing clockspeeds lower than the normal operating speed -- the processor decided it was too hot, and slowed down well past the normal speed to keep heat generation down to what it could dissipate through the cooling system. Lee's test was on Adobe Premiere -- a real world test, albeit one using software that performs better with an Nvidia GPU rather than an AMD one.\n\nAccording to Geekbench, the 2018 MacBook Pro have astounding benchmarks. The \"baseline\" 15-inch MacBook Pro with i7-8750H processor has a 21042 in multi-core performance, ranging to a 22439 for the six-core i9-8850HK in the high-end MacBook Pro.\n\nThe benchmarks have come under fire from critics, with them saying that there are \"breaks\" to smooth out the performance. However, that does not appear to be the case.\n\nWhile there are pauses in the test, they are done at the end of each test, not in the middle. So, individual tests are performed under full load, with no cool-down period during the test to keep processor speeds low.\n\nIn theory, the chips kept cool should be capable of delivering the performance illustrated by the crowdsourced Geekbench testing. We shifted to a different benchmark for our own series of tests. Using Cinebench 15, we ran 10 total runs on the i9 MacBook Pro.\n\nImmediately after starting the first test, the CPU clock speed shot up to 4.17 GHz. It rapidly drops to 3.86GHz until it hits the chip critical temperature of 100C. It then drops nearly immediately to 2.57GHz and also nearly immediately drops to 84C.\\\n\nThe speed of the processor varied between 2.33GHz and 2.9GHz generally, with one profound dip to 2.02GHz, and then the range drops to a peak of 2.65Ghz.\n\nThe first time we ran the test, it hit 921. The second time it scored an 877, with an average across the 10 tests of 906.\n\nWe ran the same tests on the base i7 equipped MacBook Pro and got relatively similar results -- which should not have been the case given the difference between the i7 and i9. Out of the gate, the i7 jumps to 3.8GHz, just below the advertised boosted clock rate of 4.1GHz for that chipset\n\nAfter several back-to-back tests, keeping the processors warm and the fans running, we were able to regularly get impressive scores of up to 916. Using Intel Power Gadget, we clocked the processor speed averaging around 2.3Ghz and 2.6GHz, almost exactly what we were getting with the i9.\n\nFor our full reviews of both the i7 and i9 2018 MacBook Pros, we're going to hook them up to an external Graphics Processing Unit to see how much the thermal condition varies, when some of the heavy lifting is moved out of the MacBook Pro's chassis. This isn't a super-crisis, as long as this isn't another thermal paste situation, like back in the relative olden days. All manufacturers have to deal with it, and what varies is when the throttling kicks in as a result of the heat dissipation system engineering.\n\nAnd, it is rectifiable after-the-fact to some extent.\n\nThe most obvious solution right now is for Apple alter the peak speed of the processor by adjusting the power that the chip gets. Ironically, slowing the peak speed of the processor may allow it to finish tasks quicker, as it will slow down less to keep the CPU cool.\n\nAs PC overclockers are aware, this is a setting that can be altered. But, not by users as we are far, far down the road from jumpers that set clock speeds on Macs.\n\nIn an oddity of testing the fourth Cinebench run on the i9 MacBook Pro came in higher than the first, at 945. We expect that this is because the fans were already running at a good clip when we restarted the test.\n\nSo, Apple can also change the fan speed thresholds to accommodate a CPU load better, by setting them to kick in sooner, and faster than it does at present. This probably won't completely eliminate the thermal situation, but it will lengthen the time it will take to get there at the cost of a louder device when under heavy load. Users can do this with Macs Fan Control, or similar utility.\n\nBut, we're not expecting a solution from Apple itself today, this week, or even this summer, if we get one at all from the company.", "[BRUSSELS] European antitrust regulators fined Google a record 4.34 billion euro (S$6.9 billion) on Wednesday and ordered it to stop using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals, a ruling which the US tech company said it would appeal.\n\nThe penalty is nearly double the previous record of 2.4 billion euros which Google was ordered to pay last year after its online shopping search service was deemed to be unfair to competitors.\n\nIt represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google parent Alphabet Inc and would scarcely dent the company's cash reserves of US$102.9 billion. But it could add to trade tensions between Brussels and Washington.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next Wednesday in an effort to avert Mr Trump's threatened new tariffs on cars made in the European Union as the president looks to reduce the US trade deficit.\n\nAlphabet, which is scheduled to report financial results on Monday, said it would set aside money to pay the fine which would cut its second-quarter profit by about US$5 billion. Wall Street analysts were expecting US$6.8 billion in quarterly profit on average before the fine, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nAlphabet shares closed flat on Wednesday after technology analysts said the EU order would do little damage to the company's long-term prospects.\n\nCEMENTING DOMINANCE\n\nGoogle's Android system, which Google lets device makers use for free, runs about 80 per cent of the world's smartphones, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nAccording to the EU, Google's illegal behaviour dates back to 2011 and includes forcing manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser together with its Google Play app store on their Android devices, paying them to pre-install only Google Search and blocking them from using rival Android systems.\n\n\"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine\" over rivals, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters.\n\nGoogle has 90 days to either halt such anti-competitive practices with smartphone makers and telecoms providers or seek a delay of the order while it appeals. Alphabet risks additional penalties of up to 5 per cent of average daily global revenue for non-compliance.\n\nMajor Android smartphone makers including Samsung Electronics Co, Sony Corp, Lenovo Group Ltd and TCL Corp declined to comment on the EU case.\n\nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai warned that Android may not remain free as a result of the EU ruling or it may shift to a tightly controlled distribution model like rival Apple Inc.\n\n\"We are concerned that today's decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal in favour of proprietary systems over open platforms,\" Mr Pichai said in a blog.\n\nThe head of the US Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday he would closely review the European decision.\n\n'STABLE DOOR'\n\nMs Vestager dismissed Google's argument that it had competition from Apple, saying iPhones were not a sufficient check on Google's dominance because they cost more and require users to exert significant effort to adopt.\n\n\"What would serve competition is to have more players,\" she said.\n\nBreaking up Google, a demand made by a number of Google foes, would not address the core problems, she told reporters.\n\nGSMA, the global wireless carriers' trade body, welcomed the ruling, saying services developed by its members can now better compete with software vendors.\n\nSmall Google search competitors such as Qwant and DuckDuckGo said they now stand better chance of getting promoted by device makers.\n\nLobbying group FairSearch, whose 2013 complaint triggered the EU investigation and whose members at the time included competitors like Oracle Corp, Nokia Oyj and Microsoft Corp, also welcomed the ruling, saying it could help restore competition in mobile operating systems and apps.\n\nIndustry analysts described the EU order as too late to reshape the industry.\n\n\"Any action by the EU is akin to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,\" said Geoff Blaber of CCS Insight.\n\nPolar Capital fund manager Ben Rogoff said: \"The reality is that as long as they're delivering great utility to their consumers, consumers will still use those platforms,\" he said.\n\nA third EU case against Google, which has not yet concluded, involves its AdSense advertising service which is accused of blocking users from displaying search advertisements from Google's competitors. Google denies this.", "With home prices skyrocketing near urban cores in recent years and millennials easing into child-rearing years, the suburbs are booming once again.\n\nAnd no suburb is growing faster at the moment than Apex, according to a recent study by Realtor.com.\n\nApex -- about a half hour southwest of downtown Raleigh -- has been one of the hottest spots for new construction in the Triangle for the past decade, and that has especially been true the past three years, according to data from Realtor.com.\n\nThe number of home listings in Apex over the past three years has increased by more than 307 percent - most of that being new construction.\n\n\"There is a lot of new construction right now,\" said Drew Ludlow, a Triangle real estate broker with Giving Tree Realty. \"Re-sales are very low across the board, but new construction has been booming.\"\n\nAlmost everywhere you look across the town, Ludlow said, a builder is clearing land for 50 or 100 homes. I am always finding \"a new community popping up,\" he said.\n\nAs land prices have increased, builders are looking further out from downtown cores to build homes. That has especially been true in southern Wake County, home to some of the state's fastest-growing towns.\n\nApex, which had an estimated population of 50,451 in 2017, was the 10fastest-growing town in North Carolina last year and the 11fastest-growing one since 2010, according to estimates from the Census Bureau.\n\n\"A fast-growing suburb gets that way by attracting builders -- working up a business case for people to come in and build in their community,\" says Javier Vivas, director of economic research for Realtor.com. \"These [are places that] have what people want. They aren't right in the city, and they aren't too far out, where commute times are long.\"\n\nFor its study, Realtor.com analyzed more than 7,000 ZIP codes, focusing on ones outside a city's limits and within an hour's commute in rush hour to the center of the nearest urban area. It also considered home appreciation over the past three years, the number of home listings over the same time frame, population growth and new construction.\n\nThe top ZIP code for that analysis was 27523 in Apex, the real estate listing website found.\n\nBut the homes in that surging ZIP code aren't exactly cheap. According to its research, the list price of a median home in Apex is now $494,900 and homeowners have seen a price appreciation of 50 percent over the past three years.\n\nThe homes most in demand are four-bedroom homes priced between $400,000 to just over $500,000, Ludlow said.\n\nLudlow said that he believes Apex is just as popular or more for home searchers now as Raleigh is - especially those looking for new construction. That clearly wasn't the case a decade ago, he added, noting the town benefited from spillover growth from Cary.\n\n\"I think the reason is location, we are two-and-a-half hours from the beach, three hours from the mountains and we have Jordan Lake five to 10 minutes away,\" he said. \"Apex doesn't necessarily have the traffic and congestion that Raleigh has yet.\"\n\n\"What's driving the new construction?\" Ludlow said. \"I think ... close proximity to (Research Triangle Park) is one, and we also have great access to 540.\"\n\nApex's quaint downtown with a healthy mix of retail and restaurants has also helped.\n\nAnd there's still plenty of growth left in that corner of Wake County, Ludlow said.\n\n\"Because we are now on the map for pretty much everything -- including, possibly Amazon and Apple -- we are getting lots of hits from people wanting to move here form the West Coast or New England because of our tech jobs,\" he said. \"We already have a lot of pharmaceutical jobs and RTP, but now I am seeing a lot of people that are involved in tech and software.\"\n\nApex could continue to grow at its current rate for the next five or so years, depending on the health of the economy, Ludlow argues.\n\nAnd just like Apex grew off the back of Cary's expansion, the towns of Holly Springs, Fuquay-Varina and Pittsboro (with the coming Chatham Park development) should also continue to grow rapidly.", "With home prices skyrocketing near urban cores in recent years and millennials easing into child-rearing years, the suburbs are booming once again.\n\nAnd no suburb is growing faster at the moment than Apex, according to a recent study by Realtor.com.\n\nApex -- about a half hour southwest of downtown Raleigh -- has been one of the hottest spots for new construction in the Triangle for the past decade, and that has especially been true the past three years, according to data from Realtor.com.\n\nThe number of home listings in Apex over the past three years has increased by more than 307 percent - most of that being new construction.\n\n\"There is a lot of new construction right now,\" said Drew Ludlow, a Triangle real estate broker with Giving Tree Realty. \"Re-sales are very low across the board, but new construction has been booming.\"\n\nAlmost everywhere you look across the town, Ludlow said, a builder is clearing land for 50 or 100 homes.

In 2016, after alt-right Web site the Daily Stormer declared New Balance sneakers the \"Official Shoes of White People,\" the retailer told the press that, as a company with \"thousands of employees worldwide from all races, genders, cultures, and sexual orientations,\" it \"does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\" Last summer, British clothing company Fred Perry issued a statement seeking to distance itself from the Proud Boys, a group fond of its polo shirts that promotes \"anti-racial guilt\" and \"closed borders,\" telling the Canada Broadcasting Company, \"We don't support the ideals or the group . . . it is counter to our beliefs and the people we work with.\" A month later, after images of \"Unite the Right\" members marching through Charlottesville carrying Tiki Torches emerged, the company issued a statement on social media saying \"Tiki brand is not associated in any way with the events that took place in Charlottesville and are deeply saddened and disappointed. We do not support their message or the use of our products in this way. Our products are designed to enhance backyard gatherings and to help family and friends connect with each other at home in their yard.\" The statements and the decisions behind them were kind of no-brainers! If a group of neo-Nazis came out and said JPMorgan was the bank of choice for white supremacists, it's all but a certainty the company would put out a statement distancing itself with the organization, just like Apple would probably do the same if a similarly inclined group declared MacBooks the \"The Official Laptops of White People.\" Virtually all corporate executives understand that being linked to hate groups is a losing proposition! And then you have Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg:\n\nSpecifically, the Facebook chief told Swisher that the thinking behind allowing groups that claim the Holocaust never happened to publish those beliefs on its platform comes down to one of the company's \"core principles\" of \"giving people a voice, so that people can express their opinions.\" He unfortunately elaborated: \"The approach that we've taken to false news is not to say, you can't say something wrong on the Internet. I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people's accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that.\" (Never mind the fact that Web sites like Infowars are more than likely intentionally spreading fake news, and denying the Holocaust isn't the same thing as accidentally confusing one of the Olsen twins for the other.) What about banning a person or group that cooked up a plan to hurt someone else? Oh sure, Zuck and Co. would totally take that down. \"We're not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things,\" he added. But back to why the boy billionaire wants to make Facebook a safe space for Holocaust deniers who are just doing their best:\n\nAs you can probably imagine, the content of the interview didn't go over super-well with just about anyone outside of the Adolf Hitler Appreciation Society, leading Zuckles to pull a Trump and clarify what he meant, telling Swisher in an e-mail, \"I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that. Our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue -- but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services. If something is spreading and is rated false by fact checkers, it would lose the vast majority of its distribution in News Feed. And of course if a post crossed line into advocating for violence or hate against a particular group, it would be removed.\"", "In 1999 she became the first German model to become a Victoria's Secret Angel.\n\nAnd Heidi Klum, 44, returned to her lingerie roots when she took to the red carpet at Madison Square Garden in New York for the Grammy Awards on Sunday.\n\nThe mother-of-four stunned in a sheer dress that showed of the 5'9\" beauty's black lingerie underneath the gown.\n\nNothing to hide: Heidi Klum, 44, returned to her lingerie roots when she took to the red carpet at Madison Square Garden in New York for the Grammy Awards on Sunday\n\nThe America's Got Talent judge's high neck lace dress left little to imagination, giving an unfettered look at the German born beauty's lacy black lingerie underneath.\n\nKlum also wore a pair of strappy black heels, silver teardrop style earrings and several rings on her fingers.\n\nShe wore her wavy blonde tresses untied and cascading down her shoulders.\n\nSee-through beauty: The mother-of-four stunned in a sheer dress that showed of the 5'9\" beauty's black lingerie underneath the gown\n\nGo gothic and glam in Heidi's Ashi Studio gown\n\nAshi Studio Fall 2017 RTW\n\nGet the look below!\n\nVisit site\n\nBeing one of the world's most famous supermodels, Heidi Klum wasn't going to show up to the Grammys without ticking all the latest trends.\n\nShe opted for a delicate lace gown that grazed the carpet in bands of sheer variegated lace to showcase her famous figure.\n\nLingerie inspired clothing has been a huge trend in fashion, and while Heidi's dress checked off that box it also hit the gothic/ Victoriana motif in stride.\n\nThis gossamer sheer gown was designed by Lebanese designer Ashi Studio-- the same label also responsible for Cardi B's white confectionery dress on the red carpet tonight.\n\nSadly, Heidi's dress can't be purchased online but click right if you're interested in exploring this brand further or look lovely in lace with one of the high-streer alternatives in the edit below.\n\n* PRICES MAY NOT BE AS ADVERTISED ...NOW GET ONE LIKE IT FOR LESS Previous Next\n\nASOS Lace Dobby Patchwork Long Sleeve Mini Dress\n\nVisit site\n\nHouse of CB Griffe Dress\n\nVisit site\n\nForever 21 Kikiriki Sheer Mesh Maxi Dress\n\nVisit site\n\nAlessandra Rich Ruffled Tiered Lace Gown at NET-A-PORTER.com\n\nVisit site\n\nNicholas Rosie Lace Tiered Dress at ShopBop.com\n\nVisit site\n\nA cheeky display: The America's Got Talent judge's high neck lace dress left little to imagination, giving an unfettered look at the German born beauty's lacy black lingerie\n\nKlum reportedly spent New Years with ex-lover Vito Schnabel.\n\nShe split with boyfriend Vito after three years together back in September.\n\nBut the 44-year-old model is said to have rung in the New Year in Bali, Indonesia with the 31-year-old art curator according to a report in the latest issue of Star Magazine.\n\nHair today: She wore her wavy blonde tresses untied and cascading down her shoulders\n\nThe gala event is being held at the legendary Madison Square Garden in New York City and is hosted by funnyman James Corden.\n\nThis is the first time music's biggest night has been in the Big Apple since 2003 as it has been at Staples Center in Los Angeles for over a decade straight.\n\nIt is shaping up to be quite the event as Jay Z leads artists with a whopping eight nominations.\n\nAmong the 48-year-old rap mogul's nods were the top three honors including album, song, and record of the year.\n\nBruno Mars is also up for those three awards with a total of six nominations.\n\nKendrick Lamar also has seven nominations including record, album, and rap album of the year.\n\nGroundbreaker: In 1999 Klum became the first German model to become a Victoria's Secret Angel\n\nLegs 11 (out of ten!): Klum also wore a pair of strappy black heels, silver teardrop style earrings and several rings on her fingers\n\nMultihyphenate Donald Glover earned five nominations under his musical artist alias Childish Gambino as he is in contention for record, album, and urban contemporary album of the year.\n\nJay Z, Bruno Mars, Kendrick Lamar, and Childish Gambino will all be competing against each other and Lorde in the sought after Album Of The Year category.\n\nThe foursome will be competing a lot as Record Of The Year nominees include Jay Z's The Story Of OJ, Mars' 24K Magic, Lamar's Humble, and Gambino's Redbone as they will be up against the year's biggest hit Despacito by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber.\n\nDespacito is also nominated for song of the year - a songwriter's award - along with Mars' No. 1 hit, That's What I Like;

Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien in Providence, R.I.; Nick Jesdanun in New York; and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.", "It seems like there's always some controversy surrounding new Apple hardware. These devices are some of the most popular in the world, which means that they're bound to get closely scrutinized, perhaps more so than any other tech product on earth.\n\nWith that said, there's a brewing controversy over CPU throttling in the new MacBook Pro. Of course, throttling on a laptop as thin as the MacBook Pro is to be expected, but issue has been taken with the amount of throttling present in Apple's high-end 6-core Core i9-powered machine.\n\nThe scrutinization is warranted, especially when you consider that the least-expensive Core i9 MacBook Pro sells for $2,700. If you opt to max out the GPU, RAM, and SSD storage, the price quickly balloons to nearly $7000 after tax.\n\nJust how bad is CPU throttling on the 2018 MacBook Pro? Let's do a brief export test with Final Cut Pro X to investigate further.\n\nI opted to use Final Cut Pro X in these tests for the simple reason that it is Apple's flagship NLE, and many of the people purchasing these machines are creative professionals who work in video.\n\nTo monitor CPU performance, I used Intel's excellent Power Gadget software, which is a free download for Mac users.\n\nHere is my configuration for the test:\n\nA four minute, 4K video shot at 60 frames per second with a Panasonic GH5. (Not rendered and unoptimized). Exported with Apple's built-in Final Cut Pro preset: Web Hosting - H.264 Faster Encode - 3840 x 2160. Same exact setup used with both tests. All other apps, except apps needed for testing, closed. Power plugged in, except for the [spoiler: freezer test.]\n\nTo preface, this test is by no means law, and certain applications and export settings may respond differently.\n\nFirst test: Stock 6-core export\n\nLeaving the Core-i9 configured as default, I exported the video in 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Throttling was definitely noticeable during the export, as you can see from the following chart created from Intel Power Gadget log data:\n\nSpecifically, notice how aggressive throttling is here, with numerous occurrences of the clock speed dipping to 800MHz. According to Intel Power Gadget data, this is in response to a CPU Hot flag. (Update: these dips are actually the CPU idling)\n\nLike most laptops, previous generations of the MacBook Pro have throttled, but the throttling with the Core i9 can be quite aggressive with Final Cut Pro X exports.\n\nSecond test: 4-core export\n\nI was curious to see how the MacBook Pro would respond to the same test with only 4 cores enabled. To attempt this, I installed Xcode, and utilized the handy Instruments utility to disable two of the cores.\n\nI now effectively had a quad-core machine instead of a hexa-core machine. Would it make any difference for my Final Cut Pro export?\n\nSurprisingly, yes. The export completed in just 5 minutes and 12 seconds, 18 seconds faster than the it did when using all 6 cores.\n\nUsing just four cores (eight logical cores with Hyper-Threading)\n\nKeep in mind that the CPU inside this MacBook Pro has the following specifications:\n\nBase clock: 2.9 GHz Turbo Boost: 4.8 Ghz Cores: 6 TDP: 45W\n\nFor the majority of the testing, the wattage consumed by the CPU stayed around 20W, and overall CPU utilization stayed well below 50%.\n\nThird Test: The freezer\n\nFor the last test, I switched back to the full 6-cores and put my MacBook Pro in the freezer to keep it cool, \u00e0 la Dave Lee, who made the excellent video that lended such a big voice to this issue. Unsurprisingly, doing so resulted in the best performance out of the three tests. The video exported in just 4 minutes and 51 seconds, 21 seconds faster than the quad-core test, and 39 seconds faster than the hexa-core test without the extra cooling.\n\nThe freezer is good for short term performance on the MacBook Pro, but may prove to be an inconvenient/hazardous working environment (condensation is bad, folks).\n\niMac Pro Test\n\nLastly, I wanted to see how my iMac Pro compared, since it has plenty of thermal overhead along with an 8-core Xeon CPU. Would it easily best the MacBook Pro?\n\nJust by looking at this graph, you would think so. The CPU basically stays locked at 4.0GHz and above, and as you can see its temperatures remain relatively cool. However, the iMac Pro actually proved to be slowest on export, coming in at 6 minutes flat, a full 30 seconds slower than our slowest export with the MacBook Pro.\n\nWhy? Xeon CPUs lack onboard hardware video encoding, dubbed Intel Quick Sync Video. So even though the iMac Pro runs circles around the MacBook Pro from a thermal perspective, it doesn't really matter in this test. That's why you can't always look at pure numbers when judging a machine. Lots of variables go into measuring the performance, and it differs based on the applications you plan to use.\n\nThe results of this test are by no means a recommendation to stay away from the high end MacBook Pro. A machine should be judged on all of its merits and further testing is required before I'm able to do so. That said, the optics aren't particularly good for Apple; it's reasonable for users to expect more cores to equal better performance, especially with an app that was built from the ground up with Mac hardware in mind.\n\nAll blame shouldn't rest on Apple's shoulders, though. Intel needs better performing chips from a thermal perspective. It's one major reason why Apple's rumored transition to ARM Macs could prove to be a great thing for future laptops coming out of Cupertino.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a serious issue, or is it making a mountain out of a molehill? Sound off in the comments with your thoughts.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThis \"CPU Hot\" flag apparently doesn't correlate to throttling in the normal sense. John Poole from Primate Labs, creator of the excellent Geek Bench 4, would definitely know and he dropped some knowledge:\n\nIf the CPU is at 800MHz, the CPU isn't throttling, the CPU is idle. The test isn't using the CPU but rather the on-chip hardware encoder. https://t.co/4kXB2TXsvK\n\n-- John Poole (@jfpoole) July 19, 2018\n\nJohn notes that at 800 MHz, the CPU is idling, awaiting further instructions. This 800 MHz dip that we see on the graphs is normal in the sense that 800 MHz is an idle frequency.\n\nYet, this still has all the makings of a thermal issue. The export is slower when there are only four cores being used instead of six. And as shown, the export is obviously much faster when outside cooling is added.\n\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:", "EUROPEAN regulators came down hard on US tech giant Google, fining it a record 4.34 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for forcing mobile phone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine - it represents just over two weeks of revenue for Google - the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it would appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted.\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behaviour.\n\nIt is likely to stoke tensions between Europe and the US, which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand and has complained that the EU is singling out American companies for punishment.\n\nStill, some US politicians welcomed the ruling.\n\nDemocratic Sen.

Indeed, for now, it seems like most smart speaker owners have picked their team and stuck to it, seeing little reason to switch.\n\nDespite this reality, Samsung confirmed that they were working on a smart speaker of their own.\n\nDetails about the device were scarce, but Samsung's mobile division president DJ Koh told The Wall Street Journal that the focus would be on \"more premium,\" though it's not clear what he meant at the time.\n\nNow, however, we finally have some additional details about the device, courtesy of another WSJ report. The report claims the device, codenamed \"Lux,\" will be bowl-shaped with a stand at the bottom and lights at the top.

And the pace will only get quicker. Because it must.\n\nNowhere is that more obvious than with renewable energy, which will change Ireland's energy supplies dramatically away from fossil fuels to wind, solar and bioenergy by 2030.\n\nThe scale of transformation is such that \"the next 10 years are going to see change that we probably cannot imagine,\" says ESB chief executive Pat O'Doherty.\n\n\"We need to completely rethink how we use energy and where we get it from, but it is not clear yet what this means in practice. We don't have the luxury of time to wait around for breakthrough innovation to happen,\" he says.\n\nThe domination of the market by traditional giant utilities is being disrupted and a \"distributed and digital\" model will take root, where smart communities and tech-savvy consumers become energy players, not just customers.\n\nDecentralisation will mean locally-based energy networks will become 'the new normal', enabling easy delivery of locally-produced energy to the grid\n\nClimate change commitments and ever more demanding EU targets means that power generation, transport and heat will increasingly have to be produced from sustainably-produced electricity.\n\nCheaper costs will lead to more sustainable energy use, while bioenergy, especially biomethane, could flow through the existing natural gas network - not just fossil natural gas.\n\nDecentralisation will mean locally-based energy networks will become \"the new normal\", enabling easy delivery of locally-produced energy to the grid and flexible energy consumption.\n\nNo one predicted the huge drop in wind and solar energy costs over the past decade, says O'Doherty. However, he dismisses notions there will be a seamless transition to a Utopian 100 per cent renewable future.\n\nDespite some of the rhetoric to be heard, Ireland is currently struggling to meet existing climate change commitments, minus critical legislation, overdue State supports and incoherent planning rules.\n\nHowever, a transition to a new energy age is not an impossible ask. Ireland is close to achieving its 2020 targets for renewably-produced electricity generation, if it is behind on longer-term pledges.\n\nPreliminary numbers from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) show that more than 30 per cent of Ireland's electricity consumption last year came from renewables - more than double the 2010 figure.\n\nRecently, EirGrid announced that two-thirds of the electricity carried at any point on the electricity grid throughout the island of Ireland can come from renewable sources - a world's first.\n\nHowever, the latest targets will challenge: emissions from transport, heating and electricity generation must fall from 37 megatonnes of carbon in 2016 to just over six megatonnes in 2050.\n\nComplicating matters, Ireland's population is expected to rise by 30 per cent during that time - leading to up 500,000 more homes and, potentially, one million more cars. Without major change, more carbon will arise.\n\nHeat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs) offer immediate and longer-term carbon savings, O'Doherty suggests, though \"high-efficiency gas\" will be required as \"a transition fuel\".\n\nIf properly adopted, Ireland will have \"an early start\" to cope with carbon-intensive transport and heating, he says, adding that by 2030 a third of houses will have a heat pump while two-thirds of new cars will be EVs.\n\nThe dangers of the \"wait-and-see\" approach have been highlighted too by Marie Donnelly, former head of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy: \"We can be part of it, or wait for it to be done to us.\"\n\nIn the new era, four elements will stand out:\n\nDistributed generation - where power from renewable sources, including micro-generation in homes and factories will play an increasingly significant role.\n\nDistributed storage - which will depend on the widespread use of not yet fully-developed batteries to store electricity locally for use during peak periods or as back-up.\n\nEnergy efficiency - increasingly available and affordable devices that will help to cut energy demand.\n\nDemand response - technology that will help control energy usage during peak and high pricing periods.\n\nWind and solar have the potential to deliver the quickest wins. Onshore and offshore wind need the same help from the State, says Irish Wind Energy Association chief executive Dr David Connolly.\n\nBoth need a guaranteed route to market with appropriate incentives and supports from the State), but they also need clear rules governing their connectivity to the grid and the right planning environment.\n\nIn the case of onshore wind, those rules were put in place 10 to 12 years ago, backed by a clear plan. However, the same situation does not apply for those seeking to build offshore wind turbines.\n\nIn short, there is too much uncertainty, Connolly tells The Irish Times: \"If I was to start an offshore project tomorrow, I don't know how to get planning.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland has some natural advantages in solar, even if that surprises despite the recent good weather. It gets more sun than Germany, for a start. But there are obstacles, says the Irish Solar Energy Association.\n\nThose in the business of producing solar are frustrated with Government delays in introducing the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), says the organisation's chief executive Michael McCarthy.\n\nFrustration is exacerbated by rules hindering their ability to send their solar-produced energy into the grid, \"which is not conducive to a good regulatory environment\".\n\nPrivate companies began to invest in solar in 2015 on the back of the Goverment's RESS pledges , but this was subsequently delayed for three years. So far, \u20ac20 million has been invested.\n\nWith proper help, McCarthy argues that up to \u20ac2 billion worth of foreign investment could flow in. If not, the investment will be lost. So, too, will be the chance of 7,000 jobs.\n\nFuture demand will be huge. Microsoft wants to build four data centres in Ireland. Apple may yet go ahead with its previously-aborted plan to build one, but not in Athenry. If it does, 3.5GW of electricity will be needed.\n\n\"It would take 2 GW of solar projects just to meet the daytime energy requirement of these data centres,\" says McCarthy, who highlights the quick wins solar can offer Ireland as it seeks to cut CO2 emissions.\n\n\"Solar can deploy 1.5 GW between now and 2020 and thus ameliorate the targets shortfall and save the Exchequer from exposure to EU financial sanctions.\"\n\nEveryone has a role to play, says SEAI chief executive Jim Gannon. Greater energy efficiency is a priority. So, too, is the costly retrofitting of buildings: \"It will require a mind shift in how we do business and how we live our lives.\"\n\nWe are, as a country, playing catch-up on our obligations\n\nHowever, people can be \"nudged\" into better behaviour: \"We can bring more people in and then along the journey towards reducing the carbon intensity of Ireland's economy and society,\" he says.\n\nThere are many unknowns on the road ahead, such as the exact contribution that still-developing battery technologies and the capture of carbon dioxide and its subsequent storage will make.\n\nThe other big \"unknown\", however, is Brexit, since it could threaten the all-Ireland Single Electricity Market (I-SEM) - something which is \"tangible proof that co-operation works\" , says Minister for the Environment Denis Naughten.\n\nHowever, the relationships built up between EirGrid and its Northern Ireland counterpart, SONI, on one hand, and ESB and NIE Networks, on the other, provides reassurance.\n\nUltimately, everything will hinge on the final deal, Naughten accepts: \"There is no reason to believe that oil, gas and electricity will not continue to be traded post-Brexit.\"\n\nIn the meantime, links with continental Europe are being deepened. EirGrid is working to build an Celtic Interconnector to France, which will link Ireland to the continental energy market.\n\nOnce constructed, it will improve energy security and boost Ireland's ability to find buyers for hard-to-store renewable energy production and to import such energy in the other direction when needed.\n\nFurthermore, it will create the means by which Ireland could become a net exporter of energy in the decades to come if plans to produce 50GW from offshore and tidal energy by 2050 bear fruit.\n\nIreland's final National Energy & Climate Plan to bring about CO2 reductions must go to Brussels by 2019. Difficult days lie ahead, Naughten admits, frankly. \"We are, as a country, playing catch-up on our obligations. This is as much our opportunity as our obligation. In any event, it is a moral necessity and a vital national interest,\" he says.", "By Diana Kruzman\n\nRAHWAY, N.J. (Reuters) - Marvin Worthy, confined to a New Jersey state prison since 2004, cannot watch his son play basketball or visit him in college. But for the past three years, a tablet computer has kept their relationship alive.\n\nEight years after Apple introduced the iPad, specially designed tablets are reaching thousands of prisoners in state and county lock-ups around the United States. In the last year alone, at least 19 states have made tablets available to inmates, saying they reduce violence while providing education and job training.\n\n\"We talk about school, what he does every day,\" said Worthy, 37, who is serving the last 13 years of his sentence in East Jersey State Prison in Rahway. A picture of his son on prom night glowed on the small screen in his hands.\n\nThe tablets, which are tamper-proof and unable to access the internet, allow inmates to exchange emails with people on an approved list of contacts. But some advocacy groups say their charges are too high and fear they may be used to replace family visits.\n\n\"Having tablets to help people in prisons use email and technology is a good thing,\" said Caroline Hsu, an attorney at the Prisoners' Rights Project. \"But I'm worried about these services being considered replacements and not additions.\"\n\nIn some states including Colorado, New York and Virginia, companies provide the tablets for free. But in many cases, inmates have to pay for the services they use, which include email, video calls, and downloads of games, music, movies and books from a limited selection. They can also file prison grievances, access a law library or take job training courses.\n\nAll messages are limited in length and screened for security to prevent any unauthorised contact with the outside world.\n\nTwo of the big players in the field are Global Tel Link (GTL), a tablet provider based in Reston, Virginia, and Dallas-based Securus Technologies and its JPay unit, which have long sold other prison services such as pay-phone calls and money transfers.\n\nThe privately-owned companies design their own tablets and software and sell them to inmates or facilities through contracts with correctional departments.\n\nJPay and GTL told Reuters they factor in the high cost of creating a closed network for emails when setting prices. They said they do not encourage facilities to cut in-person education, visits or physical mail.\n\n'CAPTIVE CONSUMER BASE'\n\nAbout 30 states say they offer tablets to all prisoners, along with numerous county jails. Many say the computers keep inmates occupied, lowering the risk of fighting, while email and video-calling cuts the cost of hiring staff to sort mail or screen visitors.\n\nTablets are especially useful for inmates whose families are unable to travel to see them, said Brian Peters, a vice president at GTL. And family contact reduces the chance inmates will commit crimes after being released, according to studies from the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nBut because many states sign exclusive contracts with one company, tablet providers can freely set prices.\n\n\"These vendors have specialised in making money off of people in prison and their families,\" said Hsu. \"They have a literally captive consumer base.\"\n\nShe said New York's contract with JPay, which will provide tablets for some 50,000 prisoners, does not allow prisoners to send free or confidential emails to attorneys. JPay confirmed that was correct.\n\nEach email costs 40 to 50 cents to send, as much as five hours of work for New York inmates, according to 2017 data from the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative.\n\n\"This is just a means to monetize human contact,\" said Paul Wright, executive director of the Human Rights Defense Center, a nonprofit that campaigns on behalf of prisoner rights.\n\nIgnacio Rodriguez, 32, who has been incarcerated at East Jersey State Prison since 2014, said he had to choose \"between writing emails and purchasing food or other essentials from the commissary.\"\n\n\"At times the cost can be a burden,\" he said.\n\n(This version of the story corrects paragraph six to 'many' from 'all')\n\n(Reporting by Diana Kruzman, Editing by Frank McGurty and Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nUpdated Date: Jul 19, 2018 04:06 AM", "Investors sentiment decreased to 0.99 in 2018 Q1.

Ocean Blvd, Long Beach 90802.", "As was widely expected, earlier today, the EU Commission brought down its latest antitrust fine against Google, this time for an eye-popping $5 billion. The number gets the attention, but it's worth looking at the underlying details here. This was the result of a two year investigation, specifically into certain bundling practices that Google used concerning Android and some of its apps. When Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager first announced the investigation in April of 2016, she more or less explained where they were headed:\n\nThe Commission's preliminary view is that Google has implemented a strategy on mobile devices to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search. First, the practices mean that Google Search is pre-installed and set as the default, or exclusive, search service on most Android devices sold in Europe. Second, the practices appear to close off ways for rival search engines to access the market, via competing mobile browsers and operating systems. In addition, they also seem to harm consumers by stifling competition and restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.\n\nAnd... that's more or less exactly what the Commission found in today's announcement.\n\nCommissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Today, mobile internet makes up more than half of global internet traffic. It has changed the lives of millions of Europeans. Our case is about three types of restrictions that Google has imposed on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. In this way, Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\"\n\nIn particular, Google:\n\nI've been critical of some antitrust activity and supportive of others over the years, and I think it's important to take a step back and look at whether or not this actually will likely lead to greater innovation -- no matter what the reasoning is (and, it should be noted, many European officials have made it clear they think EU antitrust activities should be used to harm American companies because they're big and American, rather than for any principled reason concerning competition or innovation). And, of course, there are some people who simply hate big tech companies and will cheer on any attack on them whether it's for good or bad reasons.\n\nJust to set some signposts for the discussion: I believe, and have argued strongly over the years, that competition is the key to innovation and innovation is an important component of making everyone's lives better. You are free to disagree with those claims, but then we're having a very different discussion. This is the lens through which I view this entire discussion. Based on that, antitrust activities are useful when they are used to stop truly harmful monopolistic practices that hold back competition and innovation. But, antitrust activities for other reasons, or which don't seem likely to result in greater competition and innovation tend to be wasteful and silly. So... where does this latest fine from the EU come down?\n\nAs I noted when the investigation was first announced, it seemed that only one of the three \"prongs\" of the investigation really seemed like a big issue: the preventing manufacturers from selling phones with alternative versions of Android. There is a non-nefarious reason why Google might want this -- because if those non-Google Android versions are poorly done, it could confuse people and reflect poorly on Google... but this condition could clearly be used to stifle competition and innovation in the space. There's a reasonable argument that this was always a step too far, and Google never should have gone down that path in the first place.\n\nThe other reasons given for the fine remain... a lot less compelling. First, there's the issue of tying Google search and Chrome to offering Google Play as a pre-installed app. First off, the EU admits (oddly) that this is unfair because everyone expects the Google Play store to be pre-installed:\n\nAs part of the Commission investigation, device manufacturers confirmed that the Play Store is a \"must-have\" app, as users expect to find it pre-installed on their devices (not least because they cannot lawfully download it themselves).\n\nOkay, fair enough. But you know what that very same Play Store lets you do? Download other browsers and search apps. I don't use Chrome on my phone (I use Firefox, Firefox Focus -- which is fantastic, or Brave). I've even used alternative app stores in the past, but eventually shifted back to the Play Store, mainly because Google seemed to do a much better job of stopping dangerous or crappy apps from getting on my phone. And, as Google has suggested, part of the reason for requiring Chrome to be installed is that tons of other apps actually use Chrome components as part of how they work. So not installing Chrome with the Play Store would actually lead to a lot of apps not working properly.\n\nThe other issue for which Google was dinged was the payments to device manufacturers to make Google search the \"exclusive\" pre-installed search on those devices. Now, I could totally see a valid antitrust complaint on this point if Google were forcing manufacturers into this agreement against their will, and were able to force them to do so. But... here it's about Google doing a business deal to pay manufacturers to be the exclusive. As we pointed out at the beginning of the investigation, how is that different than when Google paid Mozilla to be the default search engine in Firefox? Then Microsoft outbid Google and Bing became the default.\n\nEither way, on this issue, Google stopped doing this practice entirely in 2014.\n\nGoogle says it's going to appeal this decision, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is hinting that if the ruling is upheld, Google may no longer be able to offer Android for free in the EU. Google also argues that the way its designed its Android business has created a tremendous amount of choice -- including providing smart phone / tablet / other devices that are available at price points and in markets where Google's main competitor in this space, Apple, refuses to make any real offerings. And that's a fairly compelling point.\n\nThe bigger question, again, though is what will be the real impact on innovation for end users of all of this. I'm not convinced (should this hold up) that it will have much of an impact either way. I doubt making any of the required changes will really harm Google that much (as noted, in at least one case, it already gave up the practice four years ago). But I also don't see how any of the required changes really helps competitors or app developers in any significant way. It doesn't make any of them more likely to get more users, or provide a better way for them to get their services out there.\n\nOne of the issues with anything having to do with innovation is that it's impossible to envision the \"innovation that would have occurred\" in the counterfactual scenario in which the supposed antitrust violations never occurred. But looking over these issues, I'm hard pressed to think of how anything would have developed all that differently if Google hadn't done these things in the first place. Perhaps Amazon's Fire devices would have a larger market? Perhaps we'd have seen more innovation with other third parties building out their own versions of Android with their own playstores. But it seems unlikely that it would have materially changed how the search market and browser market developed.\n\nOf course, it should be noted that there is some amount of karma here. Back during the Microsoft antitrust fight, Google stepped up in 2006 to complain to the EU Commission about Microsoft's bundling and default practices. Specifically, Microsoft's browser at the time included a built in search box that defaulted to Microsoft's own search (at the time, called MSN search). And Google didn't like that.\n\n\"The market favors open choice for search, and companies should compete for users based on the quality of their search services,\" said Marissa Mayer, the vice president for search products at Google. \"We don't think it's right for Microsoft to just set the default to MSN. We believe users should choose.\"\n\nAnd, amusingly, Microsoft's own response to that criticism was nearly identical to Google's today, saying that \"the user is in control\" and it's easy to change the defaults. So there's absolutely some hypocrisy in how Google has acted through this whole thing.\n\nHowever, in the end, I'm still hard pressed to see how today's fine will actually change anything in a way that improves innovation and what the public gets to do. Google is competing with lots of companies on a variety of different fronts these days. Earlier this year we had a podcast exploring how companies might disrupt Google, and I don't see how these moves make any of what we discussed any easier at all. Instead, it seems to be fighting the last fight, over mobile UI, rather than the next real competitive and innovative fights on different kinds of services.", "The boss of smart gadget maker Nest is stepping down as Google brings it in-house\n\nThe boss of smart home gadget maker Nest is stepping down as owner Google brings it in-house.\n\nNest, best known for its digital thermostats, was founded in 2010 by former Apple engineers Matt Rogers and Tony Fadell.\n\nIt was bought by Google four years ago but had been allowed to remain partly independent.\n\nNest will be combined with Google's home and living room division as the group ramps up efforts to compete with Amazon and Apple to make voice assistants and smart speakers.\n\nChief executive Marwan Fawaz will remain as an adviser.\n\nTOP DIY INVESTING PLATFORMS Low cost portfolios Low cost portfolios Cheap funds fee \u00a31.50 fund dealing Free fund dealing Free fund dealing Master portfolios Investment ideas Good for big pots Good for big pots \u00a322.50 quarterly fee Fee back in trades Great service Great service Free fund dealing \u00a37.50 share dealing No platform fee No platform fee Frequent trader \u00a34.95 dealing > Compare the best investing platform for you", "She was supported by her family as she proudly walked the runway at the end of another successful New York Fashion Show on Sunday.\n\nAnd Victoria Beckham showcased her sartorial flair as she headed out for a romantic and celebratory evening with handsome husband David in the Big Apple later that evening.\n\nThe 43-year-old Spice Girl flaunted her toned figure in an elegant berry-hued sweater which clung to her tiny waist and toned midriff as she left her hotel.\n\nNo blues here:Victoria Beckham showcased her sartorial flair as she headed out for a romantic evening with handsome husband David after her successful NYFW show on Sunday\n\nAdding a contrasting splash of colour, the fashionista paired the sweater with powder blue co-ords consisting of a blazer with flared sleeves and a flowing ankle-length skirt.\n\nAdding height to her look, the star slipped on a pair of canary yellow stilettos adn accessorised with a burgundy chain bag.\n\nHer brunette tresses were styled into an elegant bun while her striking features were enhanced with smoky eye make-up and a glossy lip.\n\nVictoria's husband of 19 years, former footballer David looked dapper in a royal blue suit and matching tie, paired with a fitted white shirt.\n\nVibrant: The 43-year-old Spice Girl flaunted her toned figure in an elegant berry-hued sweater which clung to her tiny waist and toned midriff as she left her hotel\n\nCelebration: Adding a contrasting splash of colour, the fashionista paired the sweater with powder blue co-ords consisting of a blazer with flared sleeves and a flowing ankle-length skirt\n\nGlamourpuss: Her brunette tresses were styled into an elegant bun while her striking features were enhanced with smoky eye make-up and a glossy lip\n\nThe former England captain sported a fashionable face of stubble and his blonde tresses were cropped short and swept to one side.\n\nHis suit obscured most of his multiple tattoos, save for some on his hands and neck.\n\nThe outing comes after Victoria broke her silence on the rumoured Spice Girls reunion tour, categorically denying that the quintet would be headed back on stage in a interview with Vogue before the show.\n\nShe said: 'I'm not going on tour.

Satisfied, she accepted a few dollar bills from the man who stopped by her booth at the Columbus Farmers Market.\n\nMost of Wilmot's customers paid with cash or by credit or debit card. But many of the Columbus Farmers Market vendors also accept a special currency - wood tokens in $3 increments, which customers who receive federal government benefits exchange for fresh produce, baked goods and more.\n\nFor at least a decade, low-income Hoosiers have purchased farmers market offerings using funds from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, government benefits previously called food stamps. But most don't. Of the total SNAP benefits redeemed in Indiana last year, less than 1 percent were spent at farmers markets.\n\nStill, advocates say it's important for low-income people to have access to these markets, many of whom live in food deserts -- areas miles from the closest grocery store.\n\n\"Our farmers are very welcoming,\" said Christina McDougall, executive director of the Hoosier Farmers Market Association. \"They have a genuine interest in how to help food insecure families in the state of Indiana, and I think that is a huge testament to what farmers bring to the community.\"\n\nIt will soon be harder at some farmers markets to use SNAP benefits. The company that processes some 40 percent of SNAP transactions at farmers markets across the U.S. will shut down at the end of the month, according to a report from the Washington Post. This puts 24 of Indiana's 74 SNAP-accepting markets at risk of losing that service.\n\nEarlier this month, Austin-based software development firm Nova Dia Group informed the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service it would no longer provide equipment or support to nearly 2,000 farmers markets across the country.\n\nBy August 1, two dozen Indiana farmers markets will need new equipment to accept SNAP dollars, which could come at significant cost.\n\n\"The department is exploring options in an attempt to avoid a service disruption and mitigate the impact on our program participants as well as farmers and producers,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nSNAP benefits work like a debit card. Those eligible for SNAP get an electronic benefit transaction card, called a Hoosier Works cards in Indiana. These cards subtract the dollar amount spent from a total monthly balance with each swipe.\n\nIn May 2018, the most recent available data, there were 270,609 households receiving an average of $264.79 per month in SNAP benefits in Indiana.\n\nFarmers market staff swipe the Hoosier Works card through a machine that looks like one you'd use to pay by card at a grocery store. The customer gets tokens in exchange. Vendors then trade the tokens in at the end of the market for cash.\n\nIt isn't mandatory for vendors to accept SNAP dollars, but more than a third of Indiana markets do, according to the Hoosier Farmers Market Association.\n\n\"It doesn't matter to them (vendors) one way or the other because they're reimbursed regardless,\" said Stacy Findley, who oversees the Farmers Market for the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department. \"They're a neutral party, and obviously they appreciate customers regardless of their method of payment.\"\n\nFewer than half of Indiana's markets that accept SNAP benefits use Nova Dia, a wireless software compatible with Apple products like iPhones and iPads. Those that do, like Bloomington's Tuesday Market, may soon stop accepting SNAP benefits, or come up with a workaround at their own expense.\n\nTuesday Market workers might end up reporting SNAP transactions by phone, or after the market manually inputs them into a machine at City Hall.\n\n\"There's a lot of markets that are scrambling right now,\" said Marcia Veldman, Bloomington Community Farmers Market coordinator.\n\nState and federal government programs should be able to close the gap left by Novo Dia. But advocates like McDougall said it could take months for some Indiana markets to start accepting SNAP again.\n\nStates are required by law to provide free equipment to process SNAP transactions at farmers markets, and the USDA reimburses the state for half of these purchases. It isn't required, but the USDA prefers states provide wireless systems, like Novo Dia's, which are easier to use in rural areas without access to electrical outlets.\n\nIn the past two years, 15 farmers markets across the state have begun accepting SNAP benefits using government-provided equipment, said Angela Albin, SNAP program manager for Indiana's Family and Social Services Administration.\n\nThrough last November, the nonprofit organization the Farmers Market Coalition administered SNAP. In March, the USDA awarded a new contract to Financial Transaction Management, a Virginia-based company that will accept and process requests for farmers market equipment this month.\n\nBut those requests could take up to six months before farmers market staff have equipment in hand, McDougall said. \"There could be a lapse in service,\" she said.\n\nMcDougall estimates between $6,000 and $8,000 to set up and train a farmers market how to use a system. Without government help the markets would have to take on that cost to get the right equipment.\n\nAs most markets are run by local government and community nonprofits, \"it can be cost prohibitive to a market,\" McDougall said.\n\nWhile advocates worry what the loss of SNAP-accepting farmers markets will mean to low-income communities, records show the program isn't well used with SNAP beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2017, low-income Hoosiers redeemed $995,527,832 in SNAP benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, only $117,996 was spent at farmers markets, the USDA reported.\n\nThat amount is low, McDougall said, even though several markets, through partnerships with nonprofits, double SNAP customer benefits.\n\nIn Bartholomew County, for example, Columbus Regional Health's Healthy Communities program doubles what SNAP recipients can spend on meat, seafood, dairy, eggs and select other products at the Columbus market.\n\nAround $178,000 is spent at farmers markets with matching grants, according to the Hoosier Farmers Market Association.\n\nThose who manage Indiana farmers markets say lack of awareness is why so few people use their SNAP benefits at these markets.\n\nThe average person is only eligible for SNAP benefits in Indiana for a year. In that time, they don't learn they can go to a farmers market to buy everything from fruits and vegetables to meats and baked good and seeds to start their own gardens.\n\n\"We are in constant education mode and outreach mode,\" McDougall said.\n\nStigma also contributes to the low use. SNAP recipients and other low-income people are the only customers who use alternative currency like tokens at many markets, so it's easy to point out who pays with government benefits.\n\nThe Linton Farmers Market in Greene County expanded its Market Bucks program to try and reduce that stigma. Any shoppers without cash can swipe their credit card in exchange for tokens.\n\n\"We're normalizing that behavior in addition to trying to promote the program,\" said Mallory Rickbeil, who coordinates the Linton market. \"As long as our market is strong, our infrastructure for combating food insecurity in this rural area is strong as well.\"\n\nLike 84 percent of Indiana's farmers markets, the Linton market is in a USDA-recognized food desert. Much of the rural population lives at least 20 miles from a grocery store. While the market only brought in $967 in SNAP benefits and matching dollars last year, it's integral to the community's health, said market manager Mark Stacy.\n\n\"We're an hour from a Bloomington or Terre Haute or Vincennes or some place that has more variety when it comes to food choices,\" Stacy said. \"When it comes to fresh foods, the farmers market is about the only option folks have in Linton.\"", "Apple has made new betas of iOS 12 available to its developer community and public testers. iOS 12 developer beta 4 was released earlier this week and iOS 12 public beta 3 was released today.

We will appeal the Commission's decision.\"\n\nDanish former minister Vestager spoke by telephone with Google chief Sundar Pichai on Tuesday night to tell him about the decision in advance.\n\nVestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser, thereby freezing out rivals.\n\nThey were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. Google Search and Chrome are as a result pre-installed on the \"significant majority\" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says.\n\nGoogle also prevented manufacturers from selling smartphones that run on rival operating systems based on the Android open source code, it said.\n\nGoogle finally gave \"financial incentives\" to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they pre-installed Google Search on their devices, the commission said.\n\nGoogle provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.\n\nUnder EU rules Google could have been fined up to 10 percent of parent company Alphabet's annual revenue, which hit $110.9 billion in 2017.\n\nVestager's campaign against Silicon Valley giants in her four years as the 28-nation European Union's competition commissioner has won praise in Europe but angered Washington.\n\nBrussels has repeatedly targeted Google over the past decade amid concerns about the Silicon Valley giant's dominance of internet search across Europe, where it commands about 90 percent of the market.\n\nAs well as the Android and Google Shopping files, it also has a third investigation under way, into Google's AdSense advert-placing business.\n\nVestager's other major scalps include Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe EU ordered Apple in 2016 to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes that the maker of iPhones and iPads had avoided by a tax deal with Dublin.\n\nIt has also taken on Facebook over privacy issues after it admitted that millions of users may have had their data hijacked by British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nBut Brussels has had US tech giants in its sights for a decade in a half, since it imposed a huge 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive behaviour and ruled it must make changes to its Windows system.\n\nThe Google decision comes just one week before European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to travel to the United States for crucial talks with Trump on the tariffs dispute and other issues.\n\nTransatlantic tensions are also high over Trump's berating NATO allies on defence spending at a summit last week, over his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and over the US president's pull-out from the Iran nuclear agreement and Paris climate deal. - AFP", "Garage-Free-Auctions / Liquidation, Pawn & Thrift / STORE - Premier Pawnbrokers - Premier Jewellery & Loans With today's technology, convenience is king, and Apple heads the pack.

They were finally brought to safety last week. A Thai Navy SEAL died during the operation.\n\nVern Unsworth, a British cave explorer involved in the operation, dismissed Musk's device as \"a PR stunt\" that had \"absolutely no chance of working.\" The 63-year-old said in a weekend interview that Musk could \"stick his submarine where it hurts.\"Musk responded in a series of now-deleted tweets: \"Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves. Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great.\"Water level was actually very low ... you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in. If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video.\"He then added: \"You know what, don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"Many users urged Musk to withdraw the comment, but he doubled down, writing \"bet ya a signed dollar it's true\" before deleting.\n\nUnsworth told reporters that he was considering legal action.Musk returned to Twitter early Wednesday with an explanation. \"My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths and suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness and according to specifications from the dive team leader,\" he wrote.\"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader.\"Musk's apology was not posted publicly on his feed but came in a reply to another user who declared \"journalism is dead\" and linked to an opinion article on crowd-source site, Quora, taking aim at the \"criticism machine\" and \"shoddy journalism\" surrounding Musk's remarks. The opinion article, written by \"startup guy\" Jeremy Arnold, claims that \"most news outlets have, for whatever reasons, failed to tell\" the more \"nuanced\" story.\"I think what Musk wants most is fairness. That doesn't strike me as unreasonable,\" Arnold wrote.Musk said the article was \"well-written.\"\n\nIn May, Musk faced criticism for dismissing questions from analysts and reporterson a conference call as \"bonehead\" and \"boring\"and even proposed a Yelp-style ratings system for journalists.", "\"His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,\" Musk said in a tweet. \"The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nUnsworth, who played a leading role in the rescue, said on Tuesday that he had been approached by British and American lawyers and would seek legal advice after Musk directed abuse at him on Twitter.\n\n\"I am aware of his apology, and no further comment,\" Unsworth told Reuters by phone on Wednesday after Musk's latest tweets.\n\nAsked if there would be a financial settlement over the matter or if he was still considering legal action, Unsworth said he would make no further comment.\n\nAlso asked how he had heard of the apology, he repeated he had no further comment.\n\nMusk, chief executive of the electric car maker Tesla Inc, offered a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help extract the youth soccer team and the coach from the labyrinth of partly flooded passages.\n\nHowever, the rescue team of elite divers and others rejected his proposal, and a war of words erupted when CNN quoted Unsworth as saying the submarine \"had absolutely no chance of working\" and was \"just a PR stunt\".\n\nMusk responded on Twitter, saying: \"We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem.

Analysts have predicted it will raise capital to fund a list of new projects, including launching an electric semi truck, a pickup truck, a compact SUV and new battery and vehicle production facilities that Musk has proposed for China and Europe.\n\n'I am sure that Tesla needs fresh money at the latest next year,' said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB.\n\nThe Shanghai government suggested it could help with some of the capital costs. 'The Shanghai municipal government will fully support the construction of the Tesla factory,' its statement said.\n\nTesla said Tuesday\u00b4s announcement will not impact U.S. manufacturing operations, which continue to grow.\n\nMusk was talking about building a Chinese factory long before the Trump administration proposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nChina until recently levied 25-percent tariffs on imported cars, and for decades automakers have been moving to build more vehicles in the markets where they are sold to neutralize currency shifts and trade policy reversals.\n\nChinese authorities' decision to grant Tesla permission to move forward lands as President Trump is fighting to stop U.S. manufacturers from responding to his trade policy by shifting production overseas, as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc said it would do last month.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of trade conflict with Washington, China is using its power to draw investment from the global auto industry. German automakers on Monday and Tuesday dominated a list of deals between China and Germany focused on the development of electric vehicles and technology for connectivity and self-driving cars.\n\nBMW agreed with partner Brilliance Automotive Group Holdings to up production capacity at joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive to 520,000 BMW brand vehicles in 2019.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk leaves the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, China July 10. Musk was in Shanghai , and the Shanghai government in a statement said it welcomed Tesla's move to invest not only in a new factory in the city, a center of the Chinese auto industry, but in research and development, as well.\n\nCapacity at BMW Brilliance Automotive's (BBA) two production sites will outstrip BMW's U.S. plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for the first time. BMW said last week it would be unable to fully absorb a new Chinese 25-percent tariff on imported U.S.-made models and would have to raise prices on the vehicles it makes in Spartanburg.\n\nVolkswagen, meanwhile, said it will cooperate with China's FAW Group on technologies including e-mobility, connectivity and autonomous cars.\n\nTesla has been in protracted negotiations to open its own factory in China to help bolster its position in the country's fast-growing market for electric cars and to avoid high import tariffs.\n\nTesla hiked prices in China over the weekend to a level more than 70 percent higher than in the United States amid mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing that have seen several U.S. imports, including cars, subjected to retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent.\n\nMusk had previously criticized China's tough auto rules for foreign businesses, which would have required it to cede a 50-percent share in the factory.\n\nAfter China announced in May that it planned to scrap by 2022 the rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle ventures, Tesla registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai.\n\n'The Shanghai plant will certainly improve Tesla\u00b4s positioning in China and allow it to locally produce and avoid import tariffs.

This is the great value, great tremendous benefit for our country.\"", "While the rest of the world celebrated the rescue of 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach trapped in a cave in northern Thailand this week, Elon Musk is still mad that his plan to help out didn't work. And he's throwing a fit on Twitter -- he baselessly accused one of the British divers involved in the mission of being a pedophile.\n\nHere's what happened: 63-year-old British caver Vern Unsworth, who according to CNN played an instrumental role in rescuing the team, criticized Musk in an interview with the network this week for his attempted involvement in the mission. As the saga was unfolding, Musk said that his companies SpaceX and the Boring Company would help rescue the boys. He proposed creating an \"air tunnel underwater.\" Musk also had engineers from SpaceX and Tesla build and test a mini submarine for the boys to escape, but it was never used.\n\nUnsworth in an interview with CNN said Musk's submarine was \"just a PR stunt\" and had \"absolutely no chance\" of working. \"He can stick his submarine where it hurts,\" he said.\n\nMusk reacted to Unsworth's assessment in a series of tweets. He said he \"never saw this British expat guy\" and mentioned a rescue video that he said could refute his remarks. But then Musk went a step further, saying not to \"bother\" showing the video and calling Unsworth a \"pedo guy\" -- as in, accusing him of being a pedophile.\n\nWhen a fellow Twitter user pointed out the accusation Musk had lobbed, the South African entrepreneur responded, \"Bet ya a signed dollar it's true.\"\n\nNo evidence supporting Musk's claim has yet been made public, and Unsworth has yet to respond to the accusation.\n\nMusk, 47, is a combative personality and is often quick to attack those who criticize him. In a May conference call discussing Tesla's latest earnings, Musk mocked analysts. \"Boring, bonehead questions are not cool -- next,\" he said after one analyst asked a question. He told another the questions were \"so dry\" that they're \"killing me.\"\n\nHis grievances often make it to Twitter, where he lambastes and argues with fellow users and makes complaints.\n\nAlso in May, Musk went after the media, apparently incensed by a string of unflattering reports about Tesla, including production delays, a deadly autopilot crash, and questions regarding its labor practices. He lambasted the press for it's \"holier-than-thou hypocrisy\" and said he would \"create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article\" and track the \"credibility store\" of journalists and outlets.\n\nBefore the pedophile accusation, Musk spent much of the weekend squabbling over Federal Election Commission filings that show he donated to a House Republican PAC. Musk also donates to Democrats and said on Twitter that he gives a \"nominal annual amount\" to both parties to \"maintain dialogue.\" He also said that until this weekend, he didn't see the checks that go out.\n\nA week ago on July 8, in an interview with Bloomberg, Musk addressed his Twitter habits and said he would tone it down.\n\n\"I have made the mistaken assumption -- and I will attempt to be better at this -- of thinking that because somebody is on Twitter and is attacking me that it is open season,\" he said. \"And that is my mistake. I will correct it.\"\n\nMusk fired off the \"pedo\" tweet exactly seven days later. The \"be better\" plan didn't last long.", "DETROIT -- In March of 2016, Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m., and get a three-hour head start on his West Coast competitors.\n\nTesla was taking $1,000 deposits for its new electric car, the Model 3, priced starting at $35,000. And Reynolds had to have one. He managed to land near the top of the waiting list.\n\nFlash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting.\n\nAnd now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach.\n\n\"The tax credit was going to be huge,\" says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car.\n\nLast week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 -- the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year. Then it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nThat means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break -- essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price.\n\nMany Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm. \"By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,\" he said.\n\nTesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list.\n\nBut if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history. Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory. The company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March.\n\nIn March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits.\n\nMusk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June.\n\nLike many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more.\n\nAt present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford.\n\nHe wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year. Beyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and \"if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself.\"\n\nOthers on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns.\n\nMost Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit -- about 120,000 -- are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. \"If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,\" he said.\n\nThe only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.)\n\nKelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero. Three months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback.\n\nLindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. \"I've already been on the list for two years,\" she said. \"I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year.\"\n\nShe doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles.\n\nChristian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits.\n\nHe compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May.\n\nWhen all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September.\n\nAlthough Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car. \"Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,\" he said.\n\nLike Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen.\n\nHe will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.", "Next time you're grabbing a new charging cord on Amazon, you might be tempted to grab a new Hyundai as well.

A 20sq m solar photovoltaic (PV) system costs about \u20ac5,000 and could generate over 40 per cent of the typical Irish home's annual electricity demand.\n\nThat could save \u20ac500 a year. However, the electricity, in most cases, cannot be stored and must be used immediately, though solar is generated during daylight hours, predominantly around the middle of the day when most people are at work.\n\nEqually, 75 per cent of the annual energy from a solar system is produced between May-September when people typically need it least. Systems can be upgraded to store power and heat water, but that adds to costs.\n\nMeanwhile, unused generated electricity can be supplied to the national grid, but there is no system to ensure that people can get paid for it - as happens in other countries, though that will, inevitably, change in time.\n\nThe Irish Solar Energy Association (ISEA) argues that the case for people installing their own solar PV is, however, improving - though it stresses that simpler options to cut bills, such as insulation, draught-proofing, improved windows, boiler controls, etc, should be done first.\n\nEarlier this year, Minister for Climate Action and Environment Denis Naughten announced grants for roof-mounted solar grants: \"Solar PV will certainly contribute towards the decarbonisation of our electricity supply in the future,\" says Brian Denvir of the ISEA.\n\n\"There is considerable potential for domestic solar PV in Ireland especially as the costs of solar modules and supporting battery storage technologies continue to decline,\" he adds. In time, every house will be fitted with a panel as a matter of course.\n\n\"Even today, a large share of new homes are being built with solar PV as Irish building regulations now require a portion of a new home's energy to be supplied by renewable sources - in many cases solar PV is the most cost-effective way to deliver this,\" he says.\n\nThe next step is Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) - building materials with electricity-generating semiconductor materials embedded within them, such as solar tiles (like those produced by Tesla), solar cladding and solar windows.\n\nThese products are more pleasing to the eye, so architects favour them over conventional panels, but they have yet to prove that they can compete on cost, or last as long: \"But they are showing great promise,\" says Denvir.", "In a move which will enable Tesla Motors to commence the deliveries of its Model 3 Dual Motor and Performance versions to customers, the EPA has recently released its official ratings for the two versions.\n\nThe release of the EPA's ratings for Model 3 Dual Motor and Performance versions has come a few days after the Model 3 Performance version was spotted with the Monroney sticker last weekend, revealing an efficiency rating of 116 MPGe for the vehicle.\n\nIn its official release of Model 3 Dual Motor and Performance ratings, the EPA has now conformed that the both the Performance and non-Performance Dual Motor versions have got a 116-MPGe rating, with 120 MPGe and 112 MPGe respectively for city driving and highway driving.\n\nThe EPA's recently-released ratings for Model 3 Dual Motor and Performance versions also include electric motor power outputs. Interestingly, the ratings for the rear-motor of the Model 3 Performance version and those of the rear-wheel-drive single motor Model 3 are the same.\n\nMeanwhile, so far as the range is concerned, the Model 3 Dual Motor and Performance versions have both been officially rated at 310 miles on a single charge, similar to the rating for the Long Range rear-wheel-drive version. However, the official efficiency of the dual motor Model 3 vehicles is 29 kWh per 100 miles, as compared to 26 kWh per 100 miles for the single motor version.", "US electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors has deployed the first 100 Powerwalls project for a virtual power plant in South Australia. As a result of the deployment, a Powerwall and a 5 kW solar array have already been received by 100 households.\n\nThe deployment of the Powerwalls by Tesla has come as a result of a deal which the company had reached the South Australian government earlier in 2018. The deal pertained to the creation of a massive virtual power plant, via the installation of solar arrays and Powerwalls on up to 50,000 homes.\n\nThough the 'virtual power plant' initiative was hit by a delay because of a new government coming to power, Tesla finally got the go-ahead from the new government also, on the condition that it gets financing for the initiative.\n\nAccording to reports, the deployment of the first Powerwalls by Tesla in South Australia is already having a huge impact. A recent coverage by local news station 9 Adelaide showed a substantial reduction in electricity bill -- from over $500 per quarter to just $175 -- for a public housing tenant in the city, after the installation of the Powerwall system.\n\nWith the first 100 installations of Powerwall projects having been completed by Tesla in South Australia, the company is now aiming at the deployment of 1,000 more projects in the next few weeks.", "The Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA) in Germany is asking Tesla Motors Model S buyers who purchased their vehicles before March 2018 to pay back the \u20ac4,000 electric vehicle (EV) incentive which they had received from the government.\n\nThe move by BAFA is apparently an upshot of Tesla's persistent issues with the German government over EV incentives.\n\nIn 2017, the access to a new \u20ac4,000 EV incentive was initially denied to Tesla buyers in the country because the negotiations between the German government and the country's auto industry resulted in a cap on EVs with a starting price of less than \u20ac60,000.\n\nTo ensure that Model S becomes eligible for the incentives, Tesla unbundled a few standard features of the vehicle as an option, to bring down the base price of the Model S to \u20ac60,000. However, German car magazine Auto-Bild claimed in a report that potential Model S buyers could not purchase the vehicle without the options. Tesla, obviously, had refuted those claims.\n\nIn the wake of Tesla's ongoing EV-incentive issues with the German government, the BAFA has now stated on its website that its talks with Tesla \"to achieve a solution that would indemnify the customers\" have been unproductive. It also added that \"all Tesla customers who purchased the Tesla Model S before March 6, 2018\" will have to pay back the \u20ac4,000 incentive. The move will affect nearly 800 to 1,050 Tesla owners in Germany.", "Engineering research and consulting firm Munro & Associates has recently revealed that it has completed its teardown and analysis of Tesla's Model 3 electric car. In reporting its final report on the Model 3 teardown, the firm has said that car's cost analysis points toward a \"highly profitable\" vehicle.\n\nSpecifically, the final Tesla Model 3 teardown report by Munro & Associates has revealed a gross margin of more than 30 percent for the vehicle, on the lines of the projections voiced repeatedly by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk.\n\nThe reported profitability of over 30 percent reported by Munro & Associates for the Model 3 is somewhat surprising because the research firm appeared to be extremely critical of the vehicle in the partial reports it has been releasing over the past few months. In its initial comments, the firm had hinted that Model 3 would be an unprofitable and unsuccessful vehicle for Tesla.\n\nHowever, after a second teardown of Model 3, Munro & Associates has finally found that the vehicle has a potentially high gross margin.\n\nIn admitting that Munro & Associates had apparently gone wrong initially with regard to its Model 3 teardown and analysis, the company's president Sandy Munro has said in a recent interview with Autoline that he was 'kind of misled' by the first impressions of the car, and added that now he has to \"eat crow.\"", "Tesla Inc founder Elon Musk has apologised to British caver Vern Unsworth for insulting comments he made about him following the rescue of a dozen Thai schoolboys and their football coach from a cave in northern Thailand.\n\n\"His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,\" Musk said in a tweet. \"The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nUnsworth, who played a leading role in the rescue, said on Tuesday that he had been approached by British and American lawyers and would seek legal advice after Musk directed abuse at him on Twitter.\n\n\"I am aware of his apology, and no further comment,\" Unsworth told Reuters on Wednesday after Musk's latest tweets.\n\nAsked if there would be a financial settlement over the matter or if he was still considering legal action, Unsworth said he would make no further comment.\n\nAlso asked how he had heard of the apology, he repeated he had no further comment.\n\nMusk, chief executive of the electric car maker Tesla Inc, offered a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help extract the youth soccer team and the coach from the labyrinth of partly flooded passages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the rescue team of elite divers and others rejected his proposal, and a war of words erupted when CNN quoted Unsworth as saying the submarine \"had absolutely no chance of working\" and was \"just a PR stunt\".\n\nMusk responded on Twitter, saying: \"We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problem. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\"\n\nThe Tweet was later deleted.\n\nMusk said in his tweet on Wednesday that his words were \"spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader\".\n\nThe boys, aged between 11 and 16, are expected to leave hospital in Chiang Rai on Wednesday and hold a news conference in the evening.", "The Terminator's killer robots may seem like a thing of science fiction.

According to President Yoshihiro Sawa, Lexus' F sub-brand could be heading towards electrification, while retaining the petrol engines as well. Are we going to get newer models, or will the existing cars get hybrid souls?\n\nSpeaking to Auto Express at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Sawa said, \"F is very important; with F we have to think of our own original way,\" \"We don't stick to V-8, V-10, twin-turbocharged; they're important, but we're looking at the future. We'd like to find a way to connect to the next era.\"\n\nHe also added, \"I think that now, we're in a transitional period. At this moment people say EVs are trendy but three years later, who knows? People like the sound, the dynamics [of combustion engines]. I think we cannot stick to the one solution when it comes to providing emotion.\"\n\nCurrently, the F marque sells the RC F, GS F, and the LC; all of them using V-8 engines. It is most likely that all these models, along with newer models in the future, will get hybrid powertrains. This doesn't mean the combustion engines will be ruled out anytime soon. While there was no announcement of any sorts, Sawa did mention an F GT car, \"which could be a hybrid with an electric motor and a strong engine, giving a different kind of drive feel.\"\n\nThe electrification era is more or less like a shuffle, where almost everyone starts from the scratch. Lexus has not been able to give stiff competition to any of its rivals for that matter; be it the luxury marque or the performance brand itself. This seems like a good opportunity for Lexus to use this as a launch pad and showcase itself as a worthy contender against the likes of Tesla, Polestar, and BMW - to name a few.

The name of that car was the Jaguar I-Pace. I laughed back then. Well, I'm not laughing any more.\n\nIt just so happened that the international launch of Jaguar's first BEV (battery electric vehicle) was taking place in the Algarve the exact same week as the Evans family were there on our Whitsuntide half-term break.\n\nIt was a coincidence too good to miss. 'Please may I borrow one for a day to write about in my Mail on Sunday column?' I begged Karen, the nice lady in charge. 'Oh, all right then,' she said, and the next day, outside Quinta do Lago Golf Club, appeared the most stunning, all-electric SUV I've ever seen.\n\nNo matter which way one looks at the I-Pace, Jaguar has absolutely nailed the I-Pace from a design aspect. It is simply formidable\n\nThe beauty of not having an engine up front is that it gives the designers a completely blank canvas. You want your BEV to look like a shark, or a summer house or a cement mixer? Then go right ahead. Fortunately for Vassos and all other future I-Pace owners, Ian Callum and his Jaguar design team resisted any of the above in favour of what is quite the head-turner. Even the image on this page, the one with the old git trying to get in on the action, doesn't come anywhere close to doing it justice.\n\nTECH SPEC\n\nPrice \u00a375,500*\n\nBattery 90kWh\n\nPower 394hp\n\n0-60mph 4.5 seconds\n\nTop speed 124mph\n\nRange 298 miles\n\nCharge time 80% in 40mins\n\n* with \u00a34.5k Government grant\n\nThe short, aggressive (engineless) nose, which looks as if it's about to hoover up all the tarmac in its path, is reminiscent of the fabulous mid-engined GT cars of the 1960s, specifically the Ford GT40 and Ferrari 250 LM, both design icons. Spooky that both came out in the same year, 1964. Not so spooky, however, that the aforementioned Jaguar chief designer is a huge fan. Take a look at the Bond Spectre C-X75 for yet more clues as to why the I-Pace looks so damn pretty.\n\nAnd we have to wonder what effect such form might have on existing rivals such as Tesla's SUV, the Model X, a car that suddenly looks like the emperor's new clothes. Was it ever the genius work of zen-like minimalism fawning doters (guilty as charged) gushed it might be? Or is it actually just a dull and unimaginative blob with a slightly bulbous conk and those fancy falcon-wing doors we all became obsessed with due to its first-past-the-post SUV EV status and its eccentric daddy Elon, he of Planet Musk. Easy to suggest after the fact, I realise, but 'after the fact' is the land in which future legends are crowned immortal.\n\nNo matter which way one looks at the I-Pace, Jaguar has absolutely nailed the I-Pace from a design aspect. It is simply formidable.\n\nAs for the surprisingly spacious interior - also down to the lack of prehistoric inner workings (gearbox, drivetrain, etc) - they've only gone and smashed it again. The gorgeous steering wheel sets the tone for yet another dazzling assault of alluring aesthetics. Something so basic and simple is celebrated via a superconfident blend of Art Deco-style panache and Stark Industries fantasy and futurism. Enough to more than reassure the most cynical of doubters that just as much time, money, passion, talent and attention to detail has been lavished on every aspect of the I-Pace. An amazing all-round package surely destined to sweep the board come awards season later this year.\n\nAs for the surprisingly spacious interior - also down to the lack of prehistoric inner workings (gearbox, drivetrain, etc) - they've only gone and smashed it again\n\nThe Jaguar crew, keen to establish their new SUV's credentials on all sorts of terrain, pointed us in the direction of a very handy river and some acutely bumpy and dusty peaks and troughs - not to mention one of Europe's best-kept secrets, the Algarve International Circuit at Portimao. A testing ground worthy of any serious 4x4. But it's how the I-Pace performs on the open road that will be of interest to most people. And it took me and a couple of pals two, maybe three minutes to be able to confirm its prowess at acceleration, cornering and braking via such collective responses as 'Woah!', 'Oh. My. God', and 'Woah! again. Please excuse the repetition, but there was a lot of it going on.\n\nWith two electric motors (one driving the front wheels, another the rear), perfect 50/50 weight distribution and 394hp to play with, this is a seriously quick car that's exceptionally fun to chuck around.\n\nBack at the circuit, times all of the above by a thousand. The I-Pace fairly trounced a Model X around the 2.9-mile track, lasting a four laps at full tilt compared to the Tesla's much less remarkable... well, I'd rather not say.\n\nOther highlights included dual infotainment touchscreens, an idea borrowed from the Land Rover Velar and latest Range Rover, but with a new graphics package (thank the Lord). The in-car graduated acceleration-sound synthesiser, a pseudo-engine thrum pumped through the speakers that provides a soundtrack to what's happening beneath you. And then there's my standout feature: if you go for the non-leather-seat option, not only do they afford rear passengers more legroom, they also bring the I-Pace close to 100 per cent vegan. All Jaguar needs to finish the job is a substitute for a small area of glue - which currently has something or other from horses in it - used to attach the black plastic sill panels.\n\nWith a range of up to 290 miles and a satnav that not only tells you where to go but how much charge you'll have when you get there and gives energy updates en route, I can't see how rival manufacturers can outdo this electric superstar any time soon. All I-Paces start at \u00a363.5k with a pretty comprehensive spec coming as standard. (Hallelujah to that - take note, Mercedes and BMW.) That said, my car came in at \u00a380k with a panoramic roof, performance seats, carbon fibre trim and more.\n\nJaguar Land Rover has now entered my top-five car manufacturers that are currently setting the world alight\n\nJaguar Land Rover has now entered my top-five car manufacturers that are currently setting the world alight, with Skoda, Volvo, Ford and Tesla still holding their own.

But he told Congress the effort could be challenging if higher tariffs push inflation up too sharply. If the retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries slowed U.S. economy, Powell said the Fed could employ its normal tools, such as lowering interest rates. But he said that could become complicated if higher U.S. tariffs on foreign products caused inflation to accelerate. That's because the Fed's normal response to higher inflation is to raise interest rates, not lower them. Testifying before Congress for a second day, Powell said that Fed officials were hearing a \"rising chorus of concern\" from business contacts around the country about potential harm from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nINNOVATION\n\nMusk apologizes for calling diver a 'pedo'\n\nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has apologized for calling a British diver involved in the Thailand cave rescue a pedophile, saying he spoke in anger but was wrong to do so. There was no immediate public reaction from diver Vern Unsworth to Musk's latest tweets. Musk's initial tweet calling Unsworth a \"pedo\" was a response to a TV interview Unsworth gave. In it, he said Musk and SpaceX engineers orchestrated a \"PR stunt\" by sending a small submarine to help divers rescue the 12 Thai soccer players and their coach from a flooded cave. Unsworth said the submarine, which wasn't used, wouldn't have worked anyway. \"My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths ...\" Musk tweeted. \"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.\"\n\nEmployment\n\nWhite House will promote job training\n\nPresident Donald Trump is asking U.S. companies and trade associations to sign onto a pledge to give students and workers more job training and skills development opportunities in the face of increasing automation. Trump is signing an executive order Thursday to enhance vocational training, creating a national council for U.S. workers and a workforce policy advisory board. The White House said it expects the pledge to lead to at least 500,000 new career opportunities for students and workers. Executives with IBM, FedEx and Lockheed Martin plan to attend a White House event with the president Thursday, along with students and workers.\n\nRetail\n\nBlockbuster store will sell almost everything\n\nEverything in the closing Blockbuster video stores in Alaska is for sale, except the celebrity jockstrap. The Anchorage store is not yet selling the jockstrap worn by Russell Crowe in the 2005 movie \"Cinderella Man\" and other memorabilia previously owned by the actor, KTUU-TV reported. The stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, the last two stores in the state, closed for rentals this week and reopened for video-liquidation sales planned to run through August. The host of HBO's \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" sent the items earlier this year to display in the Anchorage store in an effort to ramp up business. Oliver had purchased the items at what Crowe had dubbed \"the divorce auction.\"\n\nNEWS SERVICES", "EU fines Google a record $5 billion over mobile practices\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) -- The European Union has fined Google a record $5 billion for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android mobile operating system to install Google apps.

But the prospect of losing a U.S. federal tax credit is. While CEO Elon Musk's company uses a tent to create more factory space and crank out more Model 3s, many on the waiting list worry about the looming phaseout of the $7,500 credit on Tesla vehicles. If it goes away, the car could cost too much, forcing them to cancel orders.\n\nUS coal ash pollution rules eased after industry balks\n\nDENVER (AP) -- The Trump administration is easing rules for handling toxic coal ash from more than 400 coal-fired power plants across the U.S. after utilities objected to regulations adopted under former President Barack Obama.

But leading scientists and tech innovators have signaled that such autonomous killers could materialize in the real world in frighteningly real ways.\n\nDuring the annual International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Stockholm on Wednesday, some of the world's top scientific minds came together to sign a pledge that calls for \"laws against lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\n\"... we the undersigned agree that the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine,\" the pledge says. It goes on to say, \"... we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.\"\n\nThe moniker \"autonomous weapons\" doesn't draw the same fear or wonder as a killer robot, but weapons that can function without human oversight are a real concern.\n\nIn the pledge introduced by the Future of Life Institute, signees agree that AI developments can contribute to future danger. Those backing the pledge include SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk and Google DeepMind co-founders Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. They are among more than 170 organizations and 2,400 individuals to take such a stance, according to the document.\n\n\"There is a moral component to this position, that we should not allow machines to make life-taking decisions for which others - or nobody - will be culpable,\" the pledge states. \"There is also a powerful pragmatic argument: lethal autonomous weapons, selecting and engaging targets without human intervention, would be dangerously destabilizing for every country and individual.\"\n\nThe position of the pledge is ultimately to encourage global governments to take legal action to ban any possibility of future destruction.\n\n\"Stigmatizing and preventing such an arms race should be a high priority for national and global security,\" the pledge states.\n\nThis isn't the first time AI leaders have expressed doubts.\n\nLast August, corporate tech leaders wrote an open letter to the United Nations warning of an arms race in these weapons.\n\nSuch weapons, the letter said, \"threaten to become the third revolution in warfare. Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend.\"\n\nMusk also signed that letter and he spoke on his strong beliefs concerning the inevitable dangers associated with AI. He urged U.S. governors to be proactive. \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid. As they should be,\" he said in July 2017.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with Musk dire view. In an interview with NPR, Rep. Pete Olsen, R-Texas, expressed his optimism for the future of AI.\n\n\"These are machines that are learning over time from activities they've done,\" Olsen said. \"They become sort of intelligent through that learning. This is the great value, great tremendous benefit for our country.\"", "DETROIT -- In March of 2016, Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m., and get a three-hour head start on his West Coast competitors.\n\nTesla was taking $1,000 deposits for its new electric car, the Model 3, priced starting at $35,000. And Reynolds had to have one. He managed to land near the top of the waiting list.\n\nFlash forward more than two years, through much-publicized production delays. Reynolds is still waiting.\n\nAnd now, like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide, he worries that the looming phaseout of a $7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach.\n\n\"The tax credit was going to be huge,\" says Reynolds, 45, who works in digital advertising, lives in Laguna Hills, California, and drives a 9-year-old Audi A3 compact car.\n\nLast week, Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 -- the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out. Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year. Then it drops to $3,750 for six months and $1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nThat means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $7,500 tax break -- essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model's sticker price.\n\nMany Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out, predicted Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific Inc., an auto research and consulting firm. \"By then they will have been waiting for three years possibly,\" he said.\n\nTesla wouldn't comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list.\n\nBut if buyers bail, it could put the company's future in peril, costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history. Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year, but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company. In the first three months of this year it burned $1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont, California, factory. The company had $2.7 billion in cash at the end of March.\n\nIn March, Moody's Investor Service sounded an alarm, downgrading Tesla's debt into junk territory and warning that it won't have cash to cover $3.7 billion for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year. Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and drive profits.\n\nMusk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June.\n\nLike many of those still on the waiting list, Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $35,000 base. The cheapest version only comes in black, with other colors costing at least $1,000 more.\n\nAt present, Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer-range battery packs. The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla's website, the lowest price was $49,000, beyond what he can afford.\n\nHe wants the car badly enough that he'll spend over $40,000, as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $35,000. He'll hang on until the end of this year. Beyond that, he said he'll likely drop out if there's no federal credit and \"if no configuration options are made for the frugal, penny-pinchers like myself.\"\n\nOthers on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit. Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns.\n\nMost Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit -- about 120,000 -- are wealthier people who didn't need it to buy Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X, which can cost over $100,000, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid. He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility. \"If you can afford to buy a $140,000 Tesla, you don't really need the incentive,\" he said.\n\nThe only other automaker that's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors, which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year, according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site. (Edmunds regularly provides content, including automotive tips and reviews, for distribution by The Associated Press.)\n\nKelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April of 2016 because she believes in Musk's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero. Three months ago, she canceled her order, partly because of the delays, partly because she now wants a hatchback.\n\nLindland also wondered if she'd ever get the car. \"I've already been on the list for two years,\" she said. \"I need all-wheel-drive, and I would have to wait another year.\"\n\nShe doesn't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week, and she is skeptical of the cars' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money, unable to service vehicles.\n\nChristian Kingery, a Seattle-area web developer, was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016. He wanted a loaded version with all-wheel-drive for rainy weather, but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits.\n\nHe compromised and ordered a rear-drive version in April. But his delivery date was delayed, costing him the Washington credit, which he says was worth $3,000 before it expired in May.\n\nWhen all-wheel-drive became available, he switched his order, pushing delivery to September.\n\nAlthough Kingery is frustrated, he still wants the car. \"Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing, in a way that no other carmaker is doing,\" he said.\n\nLike Reynolds and Lindland, he knows about the Model 3's impressive handling, 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen.\n\nHe will just have to wait a little longer to drive one.", "Last week was a big one for billionaires.\n\nKylie Jenner, kid sister of reality-television star Kim Kardashian, scored a Forbes magazine cover extolling her efforts at the helm of her makeup company, valued by the magazine at $800 million. The feature article suggested that the 20-year-old was on pace to become the youngest-ever \"self-made\" billionaire later this year.\n\nAnd Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive of electric car company Tesla (estimated net worth: about $20 billion), made waves on social media by publicizing his newly invented kid-size submarine. The bullet-shaped tube was engineered over a weekend for the purpose of aiding in the Thai cave rescue, then was left in Thailand unused after the rescue was successfully undertaken the old-fashioned way -- with actual divers.\n\nMusk's and Jenner's lives are as far from the average as one might imagine. But we're oddly keen to keep up -- Americans have long had a fascination with the extremely wealthy. All too often, a high net worth is seen as a proxy for intelligence, success and even virtue. Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was built in no small part on his supposed achievements as a real estate magnate and business leader, along with his billionaire status -- although the exact details of his net worth were and remain oddly opaque.\n\nBut it seems we may be getting more skeptical. That's a good thing.\n\nFor all his bluster about selflessly helping the Thai government, Musk received more blowback than he bargained for. After Musk criticized Thai officials who pointed out that his invention was \"not practical\" and baselessly called one of the actual cave rescuers a pedophile, the market value of Tesla shares fell by millions. Observers accused the CEO of narcissism and self-aggrandizement and derided his incessant submarine-tweeting as a failed PR stunt.\n\nElon Musk apologizes for calling Thai cave rescue diver a pedophile \"\n\nKylie Jenner is on track to become the youngest self-made billionaire. Ever. \"\n\nAnd when the New York Daily News tweeted, \"19-year-old Kylie Jenner is worth $900 million and on pace to become the youngest self-made billionaire ever. What are you doing with your life?\" the deadpan responses were an eye-opening tour through what regular citizens regard as actually valuable contributions. \"I'm a priest,\" read one. Another came from a former refugee turned clinical neuroscience Ph.D. There were mothers raising special-needs children, and millennials just struggling to get by.\n\nPerhaps that's all because it has become increasingly obvious that the fortunes of the 1 percent haven't grown through work alone. A confluence of larger factors -- globalization, the quick uptake of new technology, government regulations that favor large corporations and capital -- have operated together to produce this blossoming of billionaires. It's a bloom that smells a bit rancid when compared with the downward-trending economic fortunes of almost everyone else. From 1984 to 2017, the wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans grew by nearly 2,000 percent. As of 2013, the median household had gotten about 20 percent poorer.\n\nStill -- there are probably better ways to counter the well-insulated billionaire class than by grumbling online. We could lobby our government to close some of the egregious tax loopholes that have resulted in the staggering expansion of personal wealth over the past several decades (carried interest, anyone?). It might even be time to institute a more progressive tax code, one in which the wealthy pay appreciably more -- something that some of the most famous billionaires themselves have asked for.\n\nWhich makes this fact worth noting: Another update from the world of stratospheric wealth was a shake-up in the list of the world's richest people. While a new crowd of wealth-mongers are sprinting to the top (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the The Washington Post, is now the richest person in modern history, with a $150 billion net worth), others, such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, have slipped down the ranks -- because they are beginning to give their money away.\n\nThat's a good thing, of course generosity is more admirable than wealth for wealth's sake, and these fortunes are so large that their owners couldn't spend them if they tried. Yet it's worth thinking harder about how these resources were amassed in the first place, and about whether the charitable endeavors they make possible -- whether anti-malaria campaigns or tiny useless submarines -- outweigh the inequality that brings them into being. Money isn't the only thing we value, after all.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nChristine Emba is an opinion columnist and editor for The Post.\n\nJoin the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.", "Joe Skipper / Reuters\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is more active, and candid, on Twitter than the average Fortune 500 CEO.But he's become increasingly combative on the platform, responding to criticism in a tone that has alarmed some investors.While Musk has said he would try to use more restraint on Twitter, he accused one of the divers involved in the Thailand cave rescue of being a pedophile on Sunday and said he would bet money to back his accusation. He later deleted the tweets and apologized. Musk may not change his ways until they have a significant negative impact on Tesla, Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management, told Business Insider.\n\nTesla has a problem that has nothing to do with production rates, market share, or balance sheets: its CEO, Elon Musk, can't stop tweeting.\n\nMusk is far more active, and candid, on Twitter than the average Fortune 500 CEO. In some ways, Musk's engagement is savvy. He will respond directly to customers, provide updates about Tesla's products, and make jokes that humanize him in a way that is rare for an executive at a multibillion-dollar company.\n\nBut Musk has also become increasingly combative on the platform, responding to criticism in a tone that has alarmed some investors, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at the venture capital firm Loup Ventures, including those who, like him, are optimistic about Tesla's future.\n\n\"I've directly talked with investors who are believers in the story, but now are talking about his behavior and feeling uncomfortable about that,\" he said.\n\nMusk has become more combative on Twitter\n\nElon Musk/Twitter\n\nMusk has lashed out at people who write or report information that reflects Tesla in a negative light, including reporters from Reveal, The Information, and Business Insider, among other publications.\n\nHe has also had a contentious relationship with Wall Street analysts. In April, Tesla's stock fell 5.16% after Musk mocked analysts who were worried about the company's financial health.\n\nIn an interview published on Friday, Musk told Bloomberg he had believed he could \"attack\" people who addressed negative tweets toward him, so long as they attacked him first, but said he would attempt to limit his interactions with critical tweets.\n\n\"Generally the view that I've had on Twitter is if you're on Twitter, you're in like the meme -- you're in meme war land. If you're on Twitter, you're in the arena. And so essentially if you attack me, it is therefore OK for me to attack back,\" he said.\n\n\"If somebody attacks you on Twitter, should you say nothing? Probably the answer in some cases is yes, I should say nothing. In fact, most of the time I do say nothing. I should probably say nothing more often.\"\n\nBut two days after the interview was published, Musk accused one of the divers involved in the Thailand cave rescue of being a pedophile and said he would bet money to back his accusation. The diver, Vernon Unsworth, had said the miniature submarine Musk designed and sent to Thailand to help with the rescue would have been ineffective and was merely a publicity stunt.\n\nMusk said Unsworth was incorrect, and that he would prove the submarine would have worked as intended.\n\n\"Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it,\" Musk said in a tweet he later deleted.\n\n\"Bet ya a signed dollar it's true,\" he later said about the accusation.\n\nMusk later deleted the tweets and on Wednesday gave an apology on Twitter.\n\nAny news may be good news for MuskStory Continues\n\nElon Musk/Twitter\n\nTesla's stock fell 3.5% on Monday morning, and Jamie Anderson, a partner and portfolio manager at the asset-management firm and Tesla investor Baillie Gifford, told Reuters Musk's tweets were \"a regrettable instance.\"\n\nAnderson had previously expressed concern about Musk's conduct on Twitter to Bloomberg.\n\n\"We are very supportive, but we would like peace and execution at this stage,\" he said. \"It would be good to just concentrate on the core task.\"\n\nAccording to Eric Schiffer, a public relations consultant and chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Musk's temperamental style on Twitter may be a deliberate strategy, designed to keep him and Tesla in the news. While controversy around his Twitter use may have negative effects in the short run, it creates a larger audience for when Musk promotes Tesla's products.\n\nIn each of the annual reports Tesla has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since it went public in 2010, the company has credited the media as a significant driver of sales, so Musk may subscribe to the idea that any news is good news. According to Schiffer, Musk won't change his ways until they have a significant negative impact on Tesla.\n\n\"This won't end until he sees it negatively cripple his stock price or future funding requirements in a meaningful way,\" he said. \"Otherwise, you're going to continue to see this, because it's been, in his mind, effective.\"\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf you've worked for Tesla and have a story to share, you can contact this reporter at mmatousek@businessinsider.com.\n\nNOW WATCH: Expanding Warren Buffett's value investing approach to the socially responsible sector\n\nSee Also:\n\nOne of the Tesla Model 3's biggest critics has changed his mind and now says the car could be profitableI tried Tesla's Autopilot for the first time -- and it was nerve-racking at firstElon Musk said the Model 3 is the last product he'll have to gamble the company's existence on\n\nSEE ALSO: I tried Tesla's Autopilot for the first time -- and it was nerve-racking at first", "Musk's initial tweet calling Vern Unsworth a \"pedo\" was a response to a TV interview Unsworth gave.

Because Boeing has honed the process of designing and manufacturing an exceptionally thin and aerodynamic wing out of composites, Hazy said he's seen no discussion of anything but a composite wing.\n\nProbably no outsider is as privy to Boeing's thinking as Hazy. As he did on previous Boeing jet programs, he's been closely advising the jetmaker about the performance capabilities and pricing required to make its New Mid-market Airplane (NMA), or 797, a sales success.\n\nBoeing says it won't decide on whether or not to launch this all-new jet until early next year. Publicly, it has said nothing definitive about the airplane's design or the materials to be used.\n\nFor now, it's struggling to come up with a business plan that can ensure the required multibillion-dollar investment will earn a return, as the 797 faces stiff competition from much-cheaper derivative models of Airbus's A321 and A330 airplanes.\n\nFor that reason, said Michel Merluzeau, Bellevue-based aviation analyst with AirInsightResearch, \"It's a race to crush the costs.\"\n\nHe said one cost-driven scenario is that Boeing will try to leverage the industrial approach and processes it has created in Everett to build the 777X.\n\nBoeing built a huge new facility there to fabricate carbon composite wings, and in the main assembly plant it has installed a new highly automated wing assembly system. In addition, it's developed a robotic system that transforms the way it assembles the 777's metal fuselage.\n\nFor this reason, Merluzeau said, a metal fuselage and composite wing combination \"definitely helps Everett's case\" as the location where the 797 will be manufactured and assembled.\n\nIn an interview in London, Merluzeau added that another company with specific expertise in designing and building metal fuselages and composite wings is Brazil's Embraer.\n\nBoeing has just announced a deal to buy an 80 percent stake in Embraer's regional jets and to collaborate on its KC-390 military transport. The regional jetmaker's commercial E-jets are mostly metal with carbon composite tails. The KC-390 has wings made from composites.\n\nMerluzeau wonders whether the metal/composites combination could also create a 797 role for Embraer.\n\nIntense competition emerges\n\nIf anything, the Farnborough Air Show this week has produced more skepticism about whether Boeing will be able to get the 797 costs in line with market necessities. Airbus has highlighted its ability to squeeze the 797 by selling its A321neo at the small end of Boeing's target market and its A330neo at the large end.\n\nScott Hamilton, Bainbridge Island-based aviation analyst with Leeham.net, also at the Air Show this week, wrote Wednesday that \"the buzz on the sidelines and interviews with key observers and industry participants is that Boeing's business case for the airplane appears to be getting weaker, not stronger.\"\n\nHamilton was first to report this week that Boeing is weighing the possibility of making the 797 fuselage from metal rather than composite, though he said he has no information on which option is now favored.\n\nHazy said Boeing's task to design the 797 is very difficult because, as Airbus has made clear at Farnborough, it plans to offer airlines good alternatives that will cost much less.\n\nThe 797 is conceived as a two-airplane family seating 220 to 270 passengers and with a range of about 5,000 nautical miles. It's intended to be a twin-aisle airplane sized between the current 737 narrowbody and the 787 widebody.\n\nAs such, the 797 will fly more passengers and fly further than the hot-selling Airbus A321neo narrowbody jet.\n\nTo close the gap, Airbus has already designed a longer range version of its jet, called the A321LR, simply by adding up to three auxiliary fuel tanks in the belly of the airplane.\n\nThat crude method means the plane has less room for cargo or luggage, but the range is increased to 4,000 nautical miles.\n\nCould an XLR kill the 797?\n\nAt Farnborough, Airbus has begun to talk about another more refined and even longer-range version, the A321XLR, that it could launch as early as next year \u00ad -- if Boeing launches the 797.\n\nHazy said the A321XLR will dispense with the separate auxiliary fuel tanks and instead put the extra fuel into an expanded center wing tank that's an integral part of the airframe. Airbus will make other tweaks and increase the maximum take-off weight, allowing it to carry an extra four tons of fuel and increasing the range to about 4,400 nautical miles, Hazy said.\n\nAirbus has in the past talked about more drastic upgrades, such as stretching the fuselage by a couple of seat rows or even putting on a new wing. Hazy said those options would be much more costly -- a new wing would add $2 billion -- and are \"not top of the list.\"\n\nHe said the less costly XLR concept would give the A321 a range above that of Boeing's now out-of-production 757, a plane many airlines are seeking to replace.\n\nThat would make the XLR \"a true transatlantic airplane,\" Hazy said, and \"a much more formidable competitor to the 797.\"\n\nOver 45 years of leasing airplanes in every corner of the globe, Hazy has developed an intimate knowledge of what airlines will buy. As a lessor, he puts his money where the demand is and is a huge customer of both Airbus and Boeing.\n\nOn Tuesday at the Air Show, he announced a big order for 75 of Boeing's 737 MAX 8s, bringing his running order tally to more than 200 MAXs. Hazy agrees with Boeing's description that the MAX 8 is sized \"at the heart of the market,\" where demand is strongest.\n\nBut at the larger end of the MAX family, just below the 797 target market, Hazy's purchases reveal his skewed view of where that piece of the market is going.\n\nHe's bought 170 A321s, including 141 A321neos. \"We already have several airlines flying them over the Atlantic,\" he said. But he's bought no 737 MAX 10s, Boeing's largest single aisle jet.\n\n\"We see huge demand for the MAX. We love the airplane,\" Hazy said. \"But at the big end, above 200 seats, the market demand is for the A321.\"\n\nThe A321XLR could tilt the balance further and bite deep into Boeing's potential 797 market.", "Many thought the plane was making an emergency landing - but it was actually doing a fly-past\n\nGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nAn Airbus A330neo was flying so low over Derby that onlookers thought the plane was about to crash.\n\nThe jetliner - an A330neo in the livery of TAP Air Portugal - was seen flying so close to the ground that people thought it was about to make an emergency landing, reports Derbyshire Live.\n\nHowever, the plane wasn't in trouble but instead was doing a flypast over the Rolls-Royce factory who made the aircraft's engines.\n\nIt was revealed the flight was part of the new Airbus plane's \"five continent\" proving tour, a programme of rigorous tests to gain its certificate of airworthiness, which will allow it to begin passenger services.\n\nThe version of the Neo which flew over Derby at 6pm on Wednesday is the extended fuselage version of the plane, which can accommodate 287 seats. Its full designation is the A330-900neo.\n\nAirbus kicked off this phase of the flight test campaign by conducting flypasts of various production facilities in Europe, including Rolls-Royce, that have contributed components to the aircraft.\n\nAccording to the company's website, the plane is equipped with a three-class cabin that offers more personal space for passengers, bigger luggage bins, the latest generation in-flight entertainment, wireless connectivity and full LED ambient lighting to reduce jetlag.\n\nIn October last year, the aircraft successfully completed its maiden flight.\n\nRead More Top Stories from Mirror Online\n\nThe aircraft draws together some of the best technology from other Rolls-Royce engines, providing better fuel consumption and reduced noise levels.\n\nIts Trent 7000 engines are capable of generating up to 72,000 lbs of thrust, which Rolls-Royce said was a \"step change\" in performance compared to the Trent 700. The engines are at the heart of the company's future.\n\nThese engines are the seventh and latest member of the successful Rolls-Royce Trent engine family. It is a more powerful and fuel efficient version of the Trent 1000, and was devised and developed in Sinfin. It also produces half the noise.\n\nResidents in the area described the flypast as \"amazing\", with Tommy Freeman calling Derbyshire Live to report the low-flying plane.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nHe said: \"It looked like it was dropping out of the sky - we were so shocked!\n\n\"The plane was on its side it looked like it was going to crash.

The new airline's rumored name is \"Moxy,\" which is certainly appropriate for the energy we've always gotten from Neeleman in terms of how he handles business.\n\nTravelers can expect a better onboard experience from the new airline as a result of a new mid-sized plane called the Airbus A220, formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries. Neelman and his team have placed an order for 60 of Airbus's newly-acquired single-aisle aircraft that \"offer a comfortable five-abreast cabin.\" The jets are a bit smaller than the ones travelers are used to, like the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737, but despite the small size, the fact that they will all likely come equipped with free Wi-Fi and 19-inch seats should provide a more comfy flying experience than your average jet.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been any announcement about the aesthetics of the planes, where they will fly, and how much tickets will cost, but the startup has said that \"longer-range\" flights are definitely possible, even if you have to board at secondary airports that are ideally suited to the smaller sized jets.

US regulators require commercial jetliners to carry extra reserve fuel in case flights are forced off schedule by foul weather, congested airports or other causes, or if the plane has to divert to another airport.\n\n\"A 30-minute reserve isn't going to work on a 20-minute flight time,\" said John Langford, founder of Aurora Flight Sciences, purchased last year by Boeing for its pioneering work in autonomous flight.\n\nIt's the type of multifaceted challenge, encompassing new technologies and regulatory complexities, that the Chicago-based manufacturer plans to tackle with a newly formed unit, Boeing Next. The company is creating the operation as a companion to HorizonX, its venture-capital arm, which is focused on fostering futuristic technologies. Steve Nordlund will head both initiatives.\n\nFleets of strange new electric flying machines are apt to be buzzing over congested city streets within years - not decades, given the rapidly evolving technology for batteries and artificial intelligence, Greg Hyslop, Boeing's chief technology officer, told reporters at the Farnborough air show. \"We're at an inflection point where things will change, and change rapidly,\" Mr Hyslop said.\n\nE-commerce and creaky \"terrestrial infrastructure\" that's struggling to keep pace with increasingly mobile populations are among the forces driving this new trend. But formidable obstacles remain, starting with the complex traffic system needed to keep flying taxis from colliding with buildings, cars, drones, conventional aircraft and of course people on the ground.\n\nAerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia is among the sceptics that the new technology, and regulations to manage it, will be developed in the next decade. \"2040 is very aggressive to me, but not inconceivable,\" he wrote earlier this year.\n\nTo take root, the industry will need \"an alchemical mix of autonomy, hyper-efficient manufacturing, battery improvements/air vehicle electrification, and the discovery of unobtanium\", he quipped.\n\nBoeing bolstered its portfolio of unconventional pilotless aircraft last year by buying Aurora, which is among the companies vying to develop a flying taxi with Uber Technologies Inc. Aurora has been inventing autonomous vehicles since the late 1980s, and its portfolio of novel flying machines includes a two-seat robotic copter known as an eVTOL (an abbreviation for electric vertical take-off and landing).\n\nAurora decided to merge with Boeing after realising it would need far deeper resources to win regulatory support for its revolutionary new vehicles and the artificial intelligence that will operate them, Mr Langford said on Tuesday. Its first project following the acquisition: developing a new eVTOL for Boeing.\n\nAs to the fuel-reserve conundrum, \"that's a case where the regulators are being very, very reasonable\", Mr Langford said. Manufacturers will need to craft a plan that addresses what can go wrong, along with the flexibility of vehicles that don't need 5,000-foot-long runways. Another Aurora invention involves helicopters that can rapidly and safely select their own landing site. \"The real question: is there a market for a plane that flies 20 to 30 minutes?\" Mr Langford said. \"We'll see. We're going to do the experiments and we're going to find out.\" BLOOMBERG", "On Wednesday, July 18, 2018, the refurbished airline was unveiled under a new name, Nigerian Air, at the Farnborough International Public Airshow in London.\n\nDuring the unveiling of the airline, the Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said that 81 routes (domestic, regional and international) have been identified for the airline which is touted to promote Nigeria's cultures and traditions.\n\nNigerian Air joins leading national carriers across Africa that include the South African Airways and the Ethiopian Airlines.\n\nCurrently, the Ethiopian Airlines is considered the most profitable national carrier in Africa with laudable achievements in the last five years.\n\nThe airline has reportedly doubled the number of passengers, surpassed a target it set for 2025 and increased its profit fivefold.\n\nALSO READ: Sirika meets aircraft manufacturers, investors in UK for Nigeria Air\n\nThe Ethiopian Airline's ability to manage to grow its seat capacity by 177.7% in seven years is also one of the achievements that have placed it atop other national carriers in Africa.\n\nOwing to these achievements by the Ethiopian airlines, here are five things Nigerian Air can learn from Africa's most profitable airline.\n\nThe Nigerian Air should ensure the management team is made up of professionals with a vast experience in running the airline.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Insider South Africa, Ethiopian Airlines' current management team has over 421 years of airlines industry experience between them.\n\nThe Ethiopian government leaves the management team, in their capacity as the professionals, to run the company on sound business principles.\n\nThe airline's current CEO, Tewolde Gebremariam kicked off his career in the airline in the cargo traffic handling department in 1985 and worked his way up the ladder gradually.\n\nHe also said it will be run as a business, not a social service and government will not be involved in running it or deciding who runs it.\n\nThe management of the Nigerian Air should not expect or rely on government bailouts as it has been witnessed in many government agencies in Nigeria - even state governments. This is because since the government had made up its mind to make the airline a profit-making business venture. The Ethiopian Airlines doesn't expect a cent from the government either does the airline go cap in hand seeking a bailout because it is run strictly like a privately owned airline.\n\nCorroborating this, Sirika said \"The investors will have full responsibility for this.\n\n\"The Nigerian Government will not own more than 5% (maximum) of the new National Carrier. The government will not be involved in running it or deciding who runs it.\"\n\nTo leverage on the success of the Ethiopian Airlines, Nigeria's national carrier, Nigeria Air must get it right in terms of insourcing infrastructure and skills development for staff.\n\nAccording to reports, Ethiopian Airlines has Africa's largest aviation training academy where over 4,000 pilots, marketers, and flight-attendants are trained annually.\n\nThe airlines also own the largest cargo terminal in Africa, the largest technical maintenance facility.\n\nSirika hinted at plans to achieve this feat with Nigerian Air saying \"We've been talking to Airbus and Boeing (and they're present at this event) regarding the aircraft for Nigeria Air, and we will be making announcements very soon. We are currently negotiating.\"\n\nFor now, the Nigerian Air should adopt a clear-cut vision which it can generate its mission statement from onward.\n\nSirika said: \"New terminals in Lagos and Abuja Airports will add 11 million passenger capacity in each of the two airports. Lagos currently does 8 million per annum (was built in 1979 for 200,000 passengers annually), while Abuja does 5 million.\"\n\nDaily Maverick newspaper reports that for the Ethiopian Airline, the national carrier started by revamping its international network.

That anxiety is particularly pronounced in Asia, he told investors.\n\n\"The world today is governed by the tweets we receive every morning from one side of the Atlantic,\" Mr. Schulz said.\n\nThat is creating pressure among airlines and governments, he said, adding that \"some of our customers have asked as not to fuel the [trade] war.\"\n\nThe European plane maker kicked off the third day of this week's Farnborough International Air Show with the announcement of a deal for six A330-900 wide-body planes from an undisclosed customer. Even with additional deals including for the sale of two A350 long-haul jets to Uganda Airways and 25 A320neo planes to Mexico's Viva Aerobus, about half of the company's Farnborough orders so far are from buyers which aren't publicly identified. \"Clearly we don't like undisclosed orders but we have to respect customers,\" Mr. Schulz said.\n\nBoeing on Wednesday said it snared commitments for a total of 93 single-aisle 737 Max airplanes valued at $11 billion at current list prices from four unnamed airline and airplane-leasing customers. Some of the deals were final while others haven't been completed, said Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's chief of commercial aircraft sales and marketing. He declined to speculate about why the customers wanted to remain unidentified.\n\nBoeing, the world's largest plane maker by sales and the biggest U.S. exporter, Wednesday also announced a deal from VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co. valued at $12.7 billion before industry-standard discounts. The budget carrier plans to buy 100 of Boeing's 737 Max plane though the contract still needs to be completed.\n\nAerospace companies are gathered at Farnborough amid heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as among Washington and a number of the U.S.'s traditionally close trading allies, including the European Union, Mexico and Canada. Industry officials said they aren't seeing an impact on demand for travel or planes, but are watching if trade could dent demand.\n\nMr. Schulz said he expected to exit from the air show with around 750 aircraft deals. Strong demand, particularly for single-aisle planes, could allow Airbus to charge airlines more for each, he said.\n\nMr. Schulz also said he was targeting orders this year for the A380 superjumbo, the Toulouse, France-based company's struggling flagship airplane. The A380 is popular with customers, but has struggled to win big orders because airlines worry about filling the double-decker plane that can seat more than 200 passengers.\n\nAirbus has had to cut production plans for the A380 to about six planes a year in 2020 because of slack demand. Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said the program would lose money at that output level, but that efforts to cut costs to produce the plane would continue.\n\nBoeing also has enjoyed strong demand for its rival 737 plane. The Chicago-based plane maker has said it is sold out until 2023. VietJet said it won't get its first 737 Max until 2022.

She must now try to ensure that the U.K. continues to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nLabour's spokesman on trade, Barry Gardiner, described the scene in Parliament \"an utter shambles.\"\n\n\"We have a prime minister who is in office, but not in power,\" he said.\n\nThe challenges to May's proposals came as some British politicians again questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 Brexit referendum, following an Electoral Commission finding that the official campaign for Brexit broke election laws. Supporters of Britain leaving the EU won the referendum with 52 percent of the vote.\n\nThe commission said the Vote Leave group, backed by senior politicians who included former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, failed to declare 675,000 pounds ($894,000) it spent with Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ. The undeclared spending meant the campaign group exceeded the 7 million-pound ($9.2 million) spending limit by almost 500,000 pounds.\n\n\"This news makes the narrow referendum result look dodgier than ever,\" Labour lawmaker David Lammy said. \"Its validity is now in question.\"\n\nThe commission said it found significant evidence that Vote Leave spent more than it declared by funneling cash to a small, unregistered pro-Brexit youth group, BeLeave.\n\nThe Electoral Commission's investigation became entangled with inquiries of Cambridge Analytica's use of data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nWhistleblowers have alleged that Brexit campaigners paid Aggregate IQ to send targeted ads and that their actions may have unfairly influenced the referendum's outcome.

Its full designation is the A330-900neo.\n\nAirbus kicked off this phase of the flight test campaign by conducting flypasts of various production facilities in Europe, including Rolls-Royce, that have contributed components to the aircraft.\n\nAccording to the company's website, the plane is equipped with a three-class cabin that offers more personal space for passengers, bigger luggage bins, the latest generation in-flight entertainment, wireless connectivity and full LED ambient lighting to reduce jetlag.\n\nIn October last year, the aircraft successfully completed its maiden flight.\n\nThe aircraft draws together some of the best technology from other Rolls-Royce engines, providing better fuel consumption and reduced noise levels.\n\nIts Trent 7000 engines are capable of generating up to 72,000 lbs of thrust, which Rolls-Royce said was a \"step change\" in performance compared to the Trent 700. The engines are at the heart of the company's future.\n\nThese engines are the seventh and latest member of the successful Rolls-Royce Trent engine family.

The unveiling of \"Tempest\" coincided with a new combat air strategy and the unmistakable words of intent from the main players in \"Team Tempest\": Charles Woodburn and and Sir Stephen Hillier, heads of BAE Systems and the Royal Air Force respectively, along with the companies Leonardo UK, MBDA UK and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWoodburn and Hillier were clear they expected more cash to come. It seems the only counter-balance to any chaos in which the government may find itself.\n\nAnd, indeed, the UK will drop a further \u00a32 billion ($2.6 billion; \u20ac2.24 billion) worth of investments on its Future Combat Air Strategy by 2025. That's on top of investments in other industrial sectors, like New Space, which includes small and micro satellites, spaceports and launch vehicles.\n\nIt's a crazy turn -- albeit, a welcome one you might say -- from a conservative UK government that traditionally would cut spending. It's still doing that, of course. A glance at the National Health Service will show you that. But it's spending big on aerospace.\n\nPut your money where your rocket is\n\nOne New Space company that's benefitted from this is Orbex, which delivers satellites to space. They've secured \u00a330 million in government and private funding as well as support from the UK and European Space Agencies. They're a UK company but European, too, and its CEO, Chris Larmour, says Brexit may even be good for the country.\n\n\"Brexit has complexities that we can't even foresee,\" says Larmour. \"But there are also opportunities, and one of them is the UK government's willingness to invest.\"\n\nSome of those other investments include a \u00a317-million vote of confidence in a candidate spaceport in Sutherland, Scotland. It's different from the other major hopefuls -- Glasgow Prestwick and Newquay in Cornwall -- in that Sutherland would be a vertical launch site. Newquay and Prestwick are bidding for horizontal launchers.\n\nSo Sutherland's got a unique selling point there, and Orbex is even developing its own rocket.\n\nIs Europe missing out?\n\nMarket projections go up and down, but when it comes to small sats over the next decade, Larmour cites a projection as high as \"\u00a362 billion in launch service value.\"\n\nIt's a number that even serial entrepreneur Richard Branson is unable to ignore. Branson is already in on the game with Virgin Galactic, which aims to send tourists into space. And with Virgin Orbit, he's grasping the small sat sector by both antennae, too. Virgin Orbit is a founding shareholder in One Web, which plans to launch 800 small sats over the next few years to bring broadband internet to four billion people.\n\n\"Small sats are exciting right now,\" says Patrick McCall, Virgin Orbit's chairman.\n\nVirgin Orbit has teamed up with Cornwall Council to get the Newquay spaceport bid off the ground.\n\nMcCall says government support for New Space companies is important. \"There is definitely a role for government,\" he says.\n\n\"Sending humans into space is harder than sending satellites into space, there's no doubt about that,\" McCall says. \"We see this with Cornwall as a first step. And we hope we'll be sending humans into space for space tourism from Newquay as well. But satellites are a great place to start.\"\n\nAnd they may just see the UK through a few tough post-Brexit years.\n\nSpaceport Cornwall's director, Miles Carden, says the partnership with Virgin Orbit \"a massive post-EU-exit opportunity for us to grow our economy in the UK. It's a new technology, and it's also about children and the STEM education agenda -- to get them excited about engineering and space.\"\n\nWe are a people company\n\nBut the UK is not without its competitors, even friendly ones.\n\nTake Portugal: It's got its own designs on the satellites industry, and it's working to establish a spaceport in the Azores. Luckily for the UK, though, Portugal has companies like Tekever who sees no reason to turn its back on the UK just because it's left some club.\n\n\"The talent is here. Regardless of what happens politically, the people are here and the need is here,\" says Tekever CEO Ricardo Mendes.\n\nTekever has a UK subsidiary where they develop a big part of the company's systems and Intellectual Property, says Mendes, \"and we don't intend to go anywhere.\"\n\n\"[Brexit] could jeopardize some of the relationships with other European countries, for sure,\" he says, \"but it will also open up other possibilities.\"\n\nThe door is still open\n\nIf you look at some of the larger aerospace players, however, they seem quite happy to make threats to the contrary.\n\nAirbus, for instance, has said that the UK exiting the EU without a deal on the single market and customs union would lead to \"severe disruption\" of its UK production. \"This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country, severely undermining UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry ...,\" wrote Airbus in a press release (June 21, 2018).\n\nIf Airbus followed through with its threat -- and there's no other way to describe it -- it would surely have a knock-on effect for smaller players further down the aerospace food chain, like Wallwork. They may be smaller than Airbus, but Wallwork provides a vital service, heat treating materials to harden them before they can be used to build planes and other vehicles.\n\n\"It's not very positive when Airbus makes those kinds of comments,\" says Simeon Collins, who manages Wallwork's Cambridge site. \"But we have to put our trust in the politicians, and that they are going to get a good deal that doesn't cause too much disruption.\"\n\nSo we got the message. The money's there.

Below is the full text:\n\nThe statute makes American court decisions and administrative actions regarding sanctions against Iran void in Europe. It also prohibits Europe-based firms from discontinuing their business ties to Iran due to foreign sanctions.\n\nThe green light for the measure from EU foreign ministers on Monday is part of the EU's reaction to US President Donald Trump's decision in May to pull the United States out of the deal.\n\nThe bloc aims both to protect European companies from US sanctions and persuade Tehran that the deal is still in its economic interests. Under the terms of the pact, international sanctions on Iran were lifted after Tehran agreed to accept strict limits on its nuclear program, verified by regular inspections and monitoring.\n\nEU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, hailed the latest move on Monday as a \"consistent step forward in the set of measures that the European Union has put in place to make sure that the economic benefits deriving from the nuclear deal can continue to be in place for Iran\".\n\n\"We are working full speed,\" Mogherini said, noting US sanctions are due to come into force in August and November.\n\n\"It's a difficult exercise,\" she acknowledged, \"because the weight of the US in the global economy and financial system is obviously relevant. But we are determined to preserve this deal.\"\n\nHowever, experts say the EU's moves are unlikely to have the desired effect.\n\n\"The EU's blocking statute only creates legal burdens and headaches for European companies,\" said former US official Richard Nephew, who served as the lead sanctions expert for the American team negotiating the 2015 Iran deal.\n\n\"It doesn't really force EU companies to stay in Iran, just to find excuses to leave that don't involve US sanctions compliance. That's because the real problem is the business interests that European companies have in the United States or that their banks have in the United States.\"\n\nThe blocking statute applies to what goes on inside the EU and cannot prevent the US from targeting American branches and assets of Europe-based companies.\n\n\"European governments have been fairly clear that European companies would be on their own and, on their own, they'll make the decisions they need. Other EU actions, such as creating separate financial channels, may help sway European business decisions but, left to only the blocking device, this initiative will fail,\" Nephew said.\n\nCuban Precedent\n\nThe blocking statute was originally created in 1996, as the EU was grappling with the impact of US sanctions on Cuba. But that statute was never fully implemented, creating uncertainty over how it would function in practice.\n\n\"We have a number of questions on how this blocking statute is going to work,\" said Luisa Santos, director for international relations at BusinessEurope, the leading lobby group representing European firms.\n\nCompanies fear that they now need to choose between continuing their operations in Iran and facing penalties in the United States, or discontinuing their operations in Iran and suffering potential legal consequences in the EU.\n\n\"We might suffer from both sides and this is an issue,\" Santos said.\n\nFirms like Airbus and Siemens are among those now facing hard choices.\n\nFrench company Total already announced that it will unwind all operations in Iran unless it is \"granted a specific project waiver by the US authorities with the support of the French and European authorities\".\n\nAnother major company impacted is SWIFT, which enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about transactions.\n\nIn 2012, SWIFT was compelled under EU and US legislation to disconnect sanctioned Iranian banks from its system. Following the Iran deal, in January 2016, many Iranian banks were able to reconnect to SWIFT. With the clock ticking down to the reimposition of US sanctions, it is unclear whether SWIFT, which is headquartered in Belgium, will be forced to disconnect the Iranian banks once again.\n\n\"As there has been no related change to EU legislation, we will naturally be consulting with and seeking clarification from both EU and US authorities,\" a spokesperson for SWIFT said.\n\nSome small- and medium-sized European businesses are also grappling with how to proceed.\n\n\"Most companies want to stay in Iran,\" Santos said, while noting also that \"most companies have, directly or indirectly, business with the US\".\n\n\"Companies are not sure how to act,\" she said, adding that firms are now waiting for Brussels to issue guidelines on how the statute will be implemented.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of time; we would need these guidelines very fast,\" Santos said. A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment before the statute is finalized in August.", "Boeing Co. is in talks with Airbus and other companies about joining its bid for a $4.7 billion heavy-lift helicopter contract in Germany, the head of business development for Boeing's defense unit said on Wednesday.\n\nGene Cunningham told Reuters that Boeing was continuing to fine-tune its approach for the German competition, which pits Boeing's CH-47 Chinook against the new CH-53K Sikorsky King Stallion built by Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe German defense ministry expects to start the competition later this year or early next, with the target of awarding a contract in mid-2020 for deliveries to start in 2023.\n\n\"We are still in talks with other companies, Airbus included, and we continue to strengthen the team that we've put in place,\" Cunningham said in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow outside London.\n\nHe said those discussions would continue as the proposal process unfolded, and Boeing evaluated Germany's needs for the new helicopters and subsequent servicing.\n\nBoeing has already teamed up with 10 German firms to bid for the contract, squaring off with the biggest U.S. arms maker, Lockheed Martin, which has also announced agreements with Germany's Rheinmetall and other firms.\n\nCunningham said the CH-47 was well positioned to win the contract given its performance, cost and the fact it is already in use by a number of Germany's NATO allies, including the Netherlands, Britain, Spain, Canada and Italy.\n\nThe CH-53K is a new aircraft developed for the U.S. Marine Corps that is due to be declared operational in 2019. The new helicopters will replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.\n\nBuying the Chinook would strengthen cooperation among German and its NATO partners, while providing assurance that the products and capabilities would be readily available to be available, Cunningham said.\n\nHe said he did not expect changes at the helm of the German air force and arms procurement arm to affect the competition. \"I don't envision a significant change,\" he said.\n\nBarry McCullough, who leads business development at Lockheed's rotary and missions systems business, said cost would clearly play a role, and that his company was working hard to reduce the cost of the new CH-53K aircraft.\n\nHe said a plan was in place to trim overall program costs by $800 million, which would drive down unit costs for possible foreign military sales to Germany and Israel.\n\nBusiness Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nMake it your business.

The flat base is part of a base-on-base pattern.\n\nThe Dow Jones stock is nearing a buy point of 194.30, MarketSmith analysis shows. Another positive sign is its relative strength line, which has been trending gently upward in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, fellow Dow Jones stock and Oil & Gas-Integrated Group member Chevron (CVX) is in a base but trading below its 50-day moving average.\n\nExxon stock has fallen modestly in 2018.

The announcement was made during this year's YPS conference currently held in Barcelona from 17th till 21st July.\n\nYPS is an initiative launched by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to bring scientists, practitioners, engineers and leaders of space industry and agencies together in a single venue to discuss recent research breakthroughs, technical advances, existing opportunities and emerging space technologies.\n\nHis Excellency Yousuf Hamad Al Shaibani, Director General of the MBRSC, said \"Hosting the 4th YPS Conference 2019 supports our belief in the youth's capabilities to promote the space sector and make major achievements in this vital area. This is supported by the fact that the average age of Emirati employees at the space centre is no more than 28 years old. Our success in hosting YPS conference also reflects the confidence of the organising committee with UAE's space exploration's ambitions, represented by MBRSC's programmes and initiatives. It also reinforces the UAE's position as a leading global conference destination and an organiser for major international events and conferences. This confirms our commitment to support the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to position the UAE as one of the leading countries in the field of space science, making this sector a key supporter of the development processes the country is undertaking in all sectors.\"\n\n\"The YPS conference discusses recent research breakthroughs, technical advances, existing opportunities and emerging space technologies. It is a valuable opportunity for Arab youth who are interested in the space sector to connect with and learn from space experts and scientists from all over the world through workshops that enable them to understand the requirements of the space sector. It also allows them to learn about the latest technologies and opportunities in this sector, and how advanced space technologies can contribute to finding solutions for the future of humanity,\" added Al Shaibani.\n\nA delegation from MBRSC is participating in the current session of the Young Professionals in Space conference, which is hosted in Barcelona, Spain from July 17-21. The 5-day conference is witnessing over 30 meetings led by prominent speakers from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), Boeing, Airbus, Virgin Orbit, the University of Colorado and leading global space agencies. The participants are discussing various fields, mainly, the current programmes and the future challenges in the space sector, the importance of developing early techniques to reduce the risks of space missions, generating photovoltaic (PV) energy in space, and the space environment and heat control. At the end of the conference, the participants will witness several experiences in the design and launch of CanSat in Spanish cities.\n\nSince its establishment in 2006, MBRSC has been adopting a methodology to transfer knowledge and build youth's capabilities; at the early stages this was achieved through gaining expertise in space science and technology from global partners. The experience has culminated into launching DubaiSat-1 and DubaiSat-2. Through building the center's capabilities and transferring knowledge from MBRSC engineers and scientists to their new colleagues, KhalifaSat- a 100% Emirati developed satellite, will be launched in the last quarter of 2018, as well as the Mars Hope Probe, which will be launched in 2020 to reach Mars orbit by 2021. This coincides with the 50th anniversary of the formation of the UAE.\n\nAbout MBRSC:\n\nThe Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, founded in 2006, is home to the UAE National Space Programme. The Centre builds and operates earth observation satellites, offering imaging and data analysis services to clients around the world. The Centre launched DubaiSat-1, DubaiSat-2, and work is underway to launch KhalifaSat, which is being built purely by Emirati engineers in the UAE. The Centre is responsible for the development of the Emirates Mars Mission and the Mars Hope Probe, a mission to reach Mars orbit by 2021 and gather key science data about Mars' atmosphere, as well as the UAE Astronaut Programme and the development of the Mars 2117 vision to build a human colony on Mars. The first step in that vision, the Mars Scientific City, will launch in 2020.\n\nFor media inquiries:\n\nMahra Mohammad Al Falasi\n\nCorporate Communications Department\n\nMahra.Alfalasi@mbrsc.ae\n\n+97146071200-ext 380 \u00a9 Press Release 2018\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this press release was provided from an external third party provider.

We look forward to see the A330-800neo flying in the colors of Uganda.\"\n\nFounded by Uganda's former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, Uganda Airlines was liquidated in the 1990s by Museveni's government under a broader program to privatize troubled state firms and open up the economy to private enterprise.\n\nThe country is keen to expand its aviation industry, especially as it prepares to start pumping crude oil from fields in its west, a development expected drive up business traveler arrivals.\n\nA new international airport, financed partly with UK credit, is being built near the fields, primarily to service the oil industry.\n\nOnce completed it will be the country's second international airport after Entebbe, south of the capital Kampala, which is also being expanded with a loan from China to handle more passengers and cargo.\n\n\"This agreement demonstrates our ambition for economic growth supported by a robust aviation industry,\" Ephraim Bagenda, chief executive officer of Uganda Airlines said in the statement.\n\n(Reporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Omar Mohammed and Kirsten Donovan)\n\nBy Elias Biryabarema", "FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The Farnborough Airshow is typically one of the world's most publicity-focused business events, with plane giants and airline bosses battling to win headlines for deals signed under the roar of stealth fighter displays.\n\nNot so this week, when Airbus and Boeing announced almost 300 orders from unnamed buyers, reversing the PR rulebook.\n\nAirbus led the anonymous jetliner haul with almost 200 orders worth $24 billion (18.38 billion pounds)at list prices, while Boeing said it had signed provisional deals with four unnamed customers for a total of 94 planes worth almost $11 billion at catalogue prices.\n\nAirbus declined to discuss the identity of the buyers, but industry sources said its list was dominated by Chinese-related leasing companies.\n\nChief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz linked the reticence to global trade tensions, telling analysts some Asian customers had asked Airbus not to fan growing disputes. \"Undisclosed or disclosed, either way the order is there,\" he said.\n\n\"If that is enough to make airline customers want anonymity, what might they do if the trade disputes were to escalate?,\" Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris commented in a note.\n\nSeveral top delegates cautioned against overstating the link with trade tensions, however. Numerous factors are at play when deciding when to reveal order plans, such as waiting for board or government approvals, they said.\n\nWinning the air show competition also has something to do with the sequence of announcements, two industry sources said. Airbus is behind Boeing in the race for orders this year.\n\nAIRASIA SUSPENSE\n\nAirbus listed orders for 80 A320neo narrowbody jets from an unidentified leasing company, another for 100 similar narrowbody aircraft, plus 14 large jets - eight A350-900 and six A330neo.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that the first order for 80 aircraft came from China's ICBC Leasing.\n\nSeveral industry sources said the largest order for 100 jets had been placed by Dublin-based global leasing giant Avolon, owned by China's HNA Group.\n\nAn Avolon spokesman said: \"We are in constant dialogue with (manufacturers) and when we have an order to announce we will do that.\"\n\nAirbus is currently tackling payment delays from HNA Group which led to a backlog of undelivered wide-body A330 jets, first reported by Reuters last week.\n\nOne has been delivered and others are expected to follow.\n\nAvolon is owned by HNA vehicle Bohai Leasing and made changes in its bond structure earlier this year to insulate itself from the parent group's financial difficulties.\n\nAvolon CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this week those measures were working smoothly, but did not discuss order plans.\n\nPlanemakers often strike deals during the rest of the year with customers shy about disclosing their identity, especially in countries like China with complex approval processes.\n\nBut when opting to announce at an air show, buyers are usually keen to promote their plans and firms like Airbus and Boeing invest in lavish facilities with space for briefings.\n\nSome high-profile orders did get announced on Wednesday with Boeing bagging a provisional 100-plane order from budget carrier VietJet and Airbus confirming an order from Mexico's VivaAerobus after Reuters reported the two sides were negotiating a deal.\n\nMarket sources did not rule out a headline-grabbing finale.\n\nAirAsia boss Tony Fernandes has left Farnborough in suspense over whether he would fly in from Malaysia to confirm an order for Airbus A330neo planes or defect to the Boeing 787, though he said earlier this week he had \"no plans\" to make the trip.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Mark Potter and Kirsten Donovan)\n\nBy Tim Hepher", "The Federal Government of Nigeria on Wednesday announced that the name of the proposed new National Carrier is 'Nigeria Air'.\n\nMinister of State for Aviation, Sen.

So what could possibly go wrong?\n\nOne big thing: A trade war.\n\nAircraft makers at this week's Farnborough International Airshow, a biannual extravaganza where billions of dollars of planes and parts are bought, say thousands of jobs are at risk in this most international of industries as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to raise tariffs on a variety of goods and other countries prepare to retaliate.\n\nWhile Trump has said trade wars are \"good and easy to win,\" aviation experts say American companies like Chicago-based Boeing will take the first hit because most of U.S. aerospace production goes to foreign buyers.\n\n\"Well over of 80 percent of U.S. commercial aerospace is exported,\" said Richard Aboulafiah, a respected aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \"U.S. aerospace is in the front line waiting to get shot first.\"\n\nThat's because aviation is truly global in production and demand. Boeing and Airbus, its European rival based in Toulouse, France, dominate the commercial aircraft market, competing for business and suppliers from China to Qatar and Canada. Being able to shop around for components makes the companies more profitable and its aircraft better.\n\n\"Aerospace thrives on free and open trade,\" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told the BBC on Monday. \"We are concerned it could affect supply chain costs, but those supply chains are flowing in both directions (between China and the U.S.). It is an intricate network around the world.\"\n\nThe U.S. has put tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, with China responding with an equivalent sum. The Trump administration is planning tariffs on another $200 billion in goods. The U.S. has also put tariffs on steel and aluminum from China, the EU and several other countries, which responded in kind.\n\nBoeing, which describes itself as \"the top U.S. exporter,\" reported revenue of $93.4 billion last year. It employs more than 140,000 people in the U.S. and 65 foreign countries.\n\nAlmost 80 percent of the 713 commercial aircraft orders for which Boeing identified a buyer last year came from foreign companies, according to data on Boeing's website. Flydubai, a low-cost carrier based in the United Arab Emirates, ordered 175 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in December, the company's single biggest order of the year.\n\nChina, which has been the target of much of Trump's ire when it comes to trade, is also a major customer for Boeing. Chinese companies, including the China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co. and China Aircraft Leasing Group, ordered 120 Boeing planes last year.\n\nMindful of aviation's economic importance, the Trump Administration is sending a high-powered delegation to Farnborough hoping to persuade the world to buy American. What they will encounter is a global industry worth some $838 billion in trade and investment that employs millions and supports the defense of the U.S. and its allies.\n\nBoeing is just one of 108 U.S. companies showing off their wares at Farnborough, including major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman and Raytheon. Exhibitors reported orders for 856 aircraft and 1,407 engines worth $116.6 billion during the last Farnborough air show in 2016.\n\nBut behind the headline-grabbing deals, smaller companies, many of whom are suppliers for the likes of Boeing and Airbus, can't help but cast a wary eye on the proceedings.\n\nKavita Dawson, president of Maven Engineering Corp. of Rockville, Maryland, which supplies spare parts for aircraft, locomotives, and the oil and gas industry, counts Lockheed and the U.S. Department of Defense among its customers.\n\nDawson said the cost of steel and aluminum, which were hit by the first round of U.S. tariffs, has risen by 10 percent to 15 percent in the last few months, which translates into higher manufacturing costs. A lot of Maven's contracts were secured months ago, so the company has had to absorb the increased costs.\n\n\"There's already been an impact with raw materials, with the costs of production and lead times,\" she said. \"I do think, though, with the checks and balances we have in our form of government, that cooler heads will prevail. I don't think there will be a 'war,' but I do think there will be an impact in the trade balance.\"\n\nDawson said that while she appreciates Trump's desire to help U.S. companies, some international customers are concerned about his comments on trade.\n\n\"There is definitely some backlash to the rhetoric,\" she said. \"I appreciate his efforts, but it might not be a bad thing to tone it down just a little bit. It would be helpful to U.S. business if the countries we deal with feel like we have their back and they have our back - that we're partners.\"\n\nNot far away, John Ashour, president of InterConnect Wiring, which employs 140 people and is based in Fort Worth, Texas, is backing Trump, despite concerns about a gradual escalation in tensions.\n\nInterConnect makes high-end cables for big aircraft makers including Bell Helicopter, BAE Systems and Airbus and believes his customers will keep coming back because the company offers the best service possible.\n\n\"We have not changed our approach to business because of this,\" Ashour said. \"I'm personally not worried about it right now. I'm believing in our president.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "LONDON (AP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday accepted amendments to a customs bill put forward by Brexit hardliners who oppose her plan for a \"common rule book\" with the European Union after the country leaves the bloc.\n\nEven with those unwanted concessions, the government only barely won a Monday night vote, gaining 305 votes in favor and 302 against. The bill would prevent Britain from collecting tariffs on behalf of EU nations unless the EU does the same for the UK\n\nThe government avoided what would have been an embarrassing defeat, but the razor-thin margin reveals the fragility of May's support as she tries to find a way to move the complex Brexit process forward.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government accepted the amendments because it sees them as consistent with the prime minister's plan as set out in a formal white paper last week.\n\nHowever, critics said May had caved in to pressure from Brexit supporters who want a complete break with Europe. They said the changes would greatly limit May's ability to move forward with the plan that prompted two hardliners in her Cabinet to resign in protest last week - and fresh resignations of lesser figures Monday.\n\nThe amendments seek to limit the government's ability to set up the customs arrangements May has advocated, which would keep close ties to Europe. They were proposed by the European Research Group, the research arm of May's Conservative Party which is headed by lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nAnother Conservative Party legislator, Anna Soubry, who opposes the \"hard\" Brexit that would see Britain leave the EU without a trade deal in place, said the government's acceptance of the four amendments mean that Rees-Mogg is now effectively \"running Britain.\"\n\nMay also came under fire Monday from a former Cabinet minister who called for a new Brexit referendum, an idea immediately rejected by the prime minister's team.\n\nFormer Education Secretary Justine Greening, also a Conservative, said the U.K. Parliament was \"gridlocked\" over the divisive issue. She said she and other senior Tory lawmakers favor a new vote.\n\nGreening said she would campaign to keep Britain in the EU, if a new referendum were held.\n\nThe day's developments heaped additional pressure on the beleaguered May, whose party is deeply split and does not enjoy majority control in Parliament.\n\nHer recent white paper outlining plans for a common rule book with the EU over trade in goods has infuriated those who favor a complete break even if it risks causing an economic shock.\n\nMay defended her plan as she opened the Farnborough International Airshow. She said it would safeguard vital jobs in the aviation industry and keep Britain's tradition as a nation in the forefront of the aviation industry.\n\nThe issue is sensitive because Airbus signaled in June that it would have to consider its long-term plans for Britain if there is no Brexit deal.\n\nMay said the plan outlined in the white paper honors the wishes of British voters - who in June 2016 backed Brexit with 52 percent of the vote - while protecting industry and national security.\n\nMay's authority has been weakened with the resignations of major figures Boris Johnson and David Davis and a series of lesser officials who disagree with her Brexit plan.\n\nThe skirmishes are expected to continue Tuesday when a different trade bill is debated. There is also a move for Parliament to begin its summer recess several days early in a bid to curtail the chaos of recent weeks.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal on May 8, 2018 amid speculation that he will pull the US from the agreement, despite pleas from his European allies that this could result in a global crisis.\n\nWhile this decision gives Trump an opportunity to push his America First philosophy and further demolish the legacy of former President Barack Obama, in the worst case scenario, the consequences could result in a war between the US and Iran.\n\nAfter the announcement has been made, the Trump administration will decide whether to wield sanctions in order to punish countries that continue to deal with Iran or establish a revised deal that would provide them with more time to comply with the restored sanctions.\n\nDonald Trump is pictured during his announcement that he will run for US President in 2016\n\nWhat is the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nThe 2015 Iran nuclear deal was arguably Barack Obama's biggest foreign policy achievement during his presidency and aimed to limit Iran's nuclear energy programme that many nations feared the country would use to form a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn exchange for this limitation, the deal struck between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, Russia, France, China and Germany - lifted economic sanctions on the Middle Eastern country, according to the BBC.\n\nUranium\n\nAs part of the nuclear deal, Iran has been limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at its uranium enrichment facility in Natanz for 10 years.\n\nIran had two uranium enrichment facilities - Natanz and Fordo - and here, uranium hexafluoride gas is fed into centrifuges to separate the isotope U-235.\n\nUranium with a three to four percent concentration of U-235 can be used to fuel nuclear power plants and can also be enriched to reach 90 percent, to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nAs well as a limit on the number of centrifuge installations, the country's uranium stockpile was reduced and the level of enrichment was kept at 3.67%.\n\nPlutonium\n\nWhile the six world powers wanted the heavy-water nuclear facility in Arak to be dismantled because spent fuel from a reactor contains plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb, Iran agreed to redesign the reactor so that it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium back in 2013.\n\nAs the modified reactor still exists, all spent fuel is sent out of the country, most of which is shipped to the US via a third country and some retained for medicine.\n\nAfter the deal was made, it was decided that Iran would not be permitted to build other heavy-water reactors or accumulate any excess heavy water for 15 years.\n\nThis photo from July 14, 2015 shows a group of Iranians cheer and spray artificial snow during street celebrations following the landmark nuclear deal, in Tehran, Iran\n\nInspections\n\nIn 2015, the White House was confident that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) would ensure that no nuclear programme was formed in secret after the deal was confirmed.\n\nInspectors from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also regularly visit nuclear sites and check that no fissile material is moved to a secret location in order to make a bomb.\n\nSanctions\n\nPrevious sanctions put in place by the UN, US and EU to stop uranium enrichment crippled Iran's economy and cost the country more than $160 billion (\u00a3110bn) in oil revenue from 2012 to 2016.\n\nThe deal resulted in Iran being able to access $100 billion (\u00a374bn) in frozen assets overseas and resume selling oil on international markets.\n\nIf Iran violated any term of the deal, the UN sanctions would 'snap back' into place for 10 years, with the option of extending for a further five years.\n\nWhy was the Iran nuclear deal made?\n\nSeveral key moments of hostility between Tehran and the West shaped the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, starting with the revelation of the covert nuclear site in Natanz in 2002 which was found by the UN's IAEA as being used to enrich uranium.\n\nA year later, Britain, France and Germany engaged Iran in nuclear negotiations and despite Washington refusing to join, Iran suspended its uranium enrichment.\n\nIn 2006, Iran announced that it would restart enrichment which resulted in the three countries collaborating with the US, Russia and China to persuade the Middle Eastern nation to curb its nuclear program.\n\nThe UN Security Council then imposed its first set of sanctions, banning the sale of sensitive nuclear technology while the number of centrifuges increased and the stockpile of low-enriched uranium grew.\n\nPresident Obama is pictured making a statement about Iran in the White House in Washington\n\nIn 2009, Obama conducted the most extensive talks between Washington and Tehran in 30 years and a year later, the IAEA said that Iran was enriching to 20 percent in Fordo.\n\nThis resulted in the European Union freezing the assets of Iran's central bank and halted Iranian oil imports ahead of Hassan Rouhani's election.\n\nIn 2013, Iran and the six world powers agreed on an interim agreement but before the deal was even finalised, Donald Trump, a New York businessman at the time, said that the deal was a 'disaster'.\n\nAround the same time that Trump announced that he was running for President, the Iran nuclear deal was finalised.\n\nIn October 2015, Iran conducted its first ballistic missile test, with the US accusing Iran of violating the deal but Obama said that these tests were 'entirely separate' from the nuclear deal.\n\nThis photo shows a Qadr H long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile fired by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in an undisclosed location in Iran\n\nIn 2016, the IAEA acknowledged that Iran had kept to the rules and most sanctions on the country were lifted, resulting in Iran re-entering the global banking system and selling crude oil and natural gas.\n\nIn November of the same year, Trump was elected as US President and by February 2017, Michael Flynn said that the government was 'officially putting Iran on notice' over its ballistic missile tests.\n\nLater in the year, Iran suffered its first ISIS group attack in Tehran which led to the country firing ballistic missiles at suspected targets in Syria.\n\nIn October 2017, Trump announced that he would not be recertifying the Iran nuclear deal and said that it 'threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline.'\n\nWhen will Trump decide on the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nTrump, who believes that the deal is too lenient and that Iran has broken parts of the agreement, announced in October 2017 that he refuses to continue signing off on the agreement and has called for new sanctions.\n\nThese sanctions are directed against Iran's Revolutionary Guard police force and Trump has asked Congress to change the US terms for the deal.\n\nHowever, in response to Trump, the European Union's Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said that there had been 'no violations' by Iran and that the deal could not be renegotiated.\n\nAs the US President tweeted, Donald Trump will be announcing his decision from the White House at 2pm EDT (7pm BST).\n\nI will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm. -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)\n\nMay 7, 2018\n\nWhat is Trump expected to say?\n\nDespite the IAEA saying that Iran was in compliance with the nuclear deal in February 2018, it is expected that Trump will announce that the US is pulling out of the deal.\n\nTrump must decide whether to renew waivers that eased sanctions on Iran's central bank, hitting oil exports and force global companies to reduce purchases of oil from Iran.\n\nAs well as this, in what is being dubbed as 'the nuclear option', Trump may also decide to reimpose all the sanctions at once and put the US in violation of the deal's terms.\n\nWhat happens if Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal?\n\nIn what has been considered as Iran's first official comment on Trump's tweet announcing he would reveal his decision on the deal, President Hassan Rouhani said that the country could face 'some problems'.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke in a meeting with officials in Mashhad and said that Iran would not be willing not to abandon the nuclear deal even if the United States pulls out\n\n'It is possible that we will face some problems for two or three months, but we will pass through this,' he said and went on to say that Iran wants to keep 'working with the world and constructive engagement with the world.'\n\nThe Islamic Republic have been preparing for every possible scenario, including a deal without Washington - which would still include the other signatories that remain committed to it - or no deal at all.\n\n'We are not worried about America's cruel decisions. We are prepared for all scenarios and no change will occur in our lives next week,' Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state TV.\n\n'If we can get what we want from a deal without America, then Iran will continue to remain committed to the deal.\n\n'What Iran wants is our interests to be guaranteed by its non-American signatories. In that case, getting rid of America's mischievous presence will be fine for Iran.'\n\nIran nuclear deal - what happens next?\n\nTrump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal abruptly restores harsh sanctions on Iran, an any companies which trades with it, meaning major companies in the U.S. and Europe could be hurt, too.\n\nThe sanctions seek to punish Iran for its nuclear program by limiting its ability to sell oil or do business overseas, affecting a wide range of Iranian economic sectors and individuals.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that licenses held by Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars in commercial jetliners to Iran will be revoked.\n\nNew rules: US President Donald Trump, seen here shaking hands with National Security Advisor John Bolton, will impose sanctions on Iran, and companies doing business with Iran, immediately\n\nCertain exemptions are to be negotiated, but Mnuchin refused to discuss what products might qualify.\n\nHe said the sanctions will sharply curtail sales of oil by Iran, which is currently the world's fifth largest oil producer.\n\nMnuchin said he didn't expect oil prices to rise sharply, forecasting that other producers will step up production.\n\nThe White House administration said it would re-impose sanctions on Iran immediately but allow grace periods for businesses to wind down activity.\n\nCompanies and banks doing business with Iran will have to scramble to extricate themselves or run afoul of the U.S. government.\n\nIn Iran, many are deeply concerned about how Trump's decision could affect the already struggling economy.\n\nIn Tehran, Rouhani sought to calm nerves, smiling as he appeared at a petroleum expo. He didn't name Trump directly, but emphasized that Iran continued to seek 'engagement with the world.'\n\nIN OTHER NEWS... Who is Samantha Grant?

But the accord has a series of time limits.\n\nUnder its terms, Iran only can maintain a stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, compared to the 100,000 kilograms (220,460 pounds) of higher-enriched uranium it once had.\n\nIran can only enrich uranium to 3.67 percent, which can be used to fuel a reactor but is far below the 90 percent needed to produce a weapon.\n\nThe deal also limited the number of centrifuges Iran can run and restricted it to an older, slower model.\n\nIran also reconfigured a heavy-water reactor so it couldn't produce plutonium and agreed to convert its Fordo enrichment site - dug deep into a mountainside - into a research center.\n\nIt granted more access to International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and set up a system that allows the U.N. watchdog to inspect other sites.\n\nIn exchange, world powers lifted the crippling economic sanctions that had locked Iran out of international banking and the global oil trade. It allowed Iran to make purchases of commercial aircraft and reach other business deals. It also unfroze billions of dollars Iran had overseas.\n\nThe deal, however, does not directly stop Iran from testing or firing ballistic missiles. It also has a series of rolling expiration dates. In 8 { years, for example, Iran can start testing up to 30 more advanced centrifuges, a number it can greatly expand two years later.\n\nFifteen years after the deal, restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment and stockpile size end.\n\nDuring the life of the accord, Iran is limited to a level where it cannot produce a bomb and - if the deal were to fall apart today - experts say it would need at least a year to build one. If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can immediately be re-imposed.\n\nThe deal's opponents argue it allows Iran to build a bomb after it expires, something Iran has explicitly promised in the accord not to do.\n\nAfter the 15 years are up, Iran could have an array of advanced centrifuges ready to work, the limits on its stockpile would be gone, and in theory it could then throw itself wholeheartedly into producing highly enriched uranium. But at the same time, nothing in the deal prevents the West from trying to rein Iran in again with sanctions.\n\nThe deal's architects and supporters say the idea is to increase dialogue and trust during the intervening 15 years and negotiate an extension or a new accord. Later deals, they argue, also can tackle other outstanding issues between Iran and the West.", "Iran's Supreme Leader has warned 'America can't do a damn thing' as politicians burned a US flag in parliament in the wake of Donald Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nWithout elaborating, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the US President of '10 lies' during his explosive annoucement yesterday and warned his country not to trust America, Britain, France and Germany.\n\nHis comments came as Iranian politicians chanted 'death to America', set fire to a US flag and a symbolic copy of the Iran deal and vowed to continue spending on the country's ballistic missile program.\n\nReferring to Trump, Khamenei added this morning: 'This man will turn to dust and his body will become food for snakes and ants.

Trump, who has called the deal 'a disaster' and 'the worst deal ever,' has worked on unwinding much of Obama's domestic and foreign agenda.\n\nTrump criticizes the deal for not including Iran's ballistic missile program or Tehran's support of groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and its aid of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. He also has criticized the fact the deal's terms expire. He said the accord 'threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline.'\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, long a hawk on Iran, has long criticized the deal\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, long a hawk on Iran, similarly has criticized the deal. Seeking to ensure Trump's withdrawal, he held a news conference last week alleging 'Iran lied' about its nuclear weapon ambitions in the 2000s. But the information he shared seemed to match up with what the IAEA already reported about Tehran's program. Israel itself is widely believed to have its own never-disclosed nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn Iran, meanwhile, many say they haven't seen the economic benefits that President Hassan Rouhani said would flow in from the accord. The public has been hit by spiraling inflation, fueling nationwide protests in December and January.\n\nATOMS FOR PEACE TO THREATS OF WAR\n\nIran's nuclear program actually began with the help of the United States. Under its 'Atoms for Peace' program, America supplied a test reactor that came online in Tehran in 1967 under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. That help ended once Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew the shah.\n\nIn the 1990s, Iran expanded its program, including buying equipment from A.Q. Khan, the father of the nuclear program in Pakistan, which has produced an arsenal. Among its activities, Iran 'may have received design information' for a bomb and researched explosive detonators, according to the IAEA. By August 2002, Western intelligence services and an Iranian opposition group revealed a covert nuclear site at the central city of Natanz.\n\nIran to this day denies its nuclear program had a military dimension.\n\nTALKS AND SANCTIONS\n\nIn the early 2000s, Britain, France and Germany launched nuclear negotiations with Iran that the U.S. sat out. By October 2003, Iran suspended enrichment. But it resumed it again in 2006 under hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. World powers imposed crippling U.N. sanctions locking Tehran out of the global economy.\n\nThe U.S. under the Obama administration started secret talks with Iran in Oman after President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, took office\n\nThe U.S. under the Obama administration started secret talks with Iran in Oman after President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, took office. Iran and world powers ultimately reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the nuclear deal, in 2015.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nExpect European nations to try to hold the accord together. Iran will likely keep up its criticism of the U.S., but probably won't back out of the deal, given its business interests. However, the U.S. pullout will weaken Rouhani's hand in Iranian politics and potentially strengthen hard-liners.\n\nEuropean plane-maker Airbus and US rival Boeing are among the biggest companies affected by Trump's decision to pull out of the deal.\n\nAirbus says it will abide by renewed U.S. sanctions but that it could take 'some time' to determine the full impact of the American decision on the aviation industry's plans to sell billions of dollars' worth of planes to Iran.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman said Wednesday that 'we're carefully analyzing the announcement and will be evaluating next steps consistent with our internal policies and in full compliance with sanctions and export control regulations.' He said he expected it to take 'some time.'\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that licenses held by Airbus and Boeing to sell jetliners to Iran will be revoked, but that certain exemptions will be negotiated.\n\nGerman multinational Siemens says it will abide by any sanctions on Iran but is waiting to see how the international community reacts to Trump's decision.\n\nCFO Ralf Thomas said Siemens, which has multi-billion euro (dollar) contracts with Iran for rail, power plant and other projects, was currently assessing the possible impact.\n\nHe says 'we will always comply and adhere to all relevant export control regulations,' but 'we are waiting for guidance from the international community.'\n\nTrump signed a document on Tuesday reinstating sanctions against Iran after announcing the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton (left) and Vice President Mike Pence (right) watched as Trump delivered his scripted remarks on Tuesday, and then Bolton briefed reporters off-camera in the White House briefing room\n\nLate Tuesday night, President Hassan Rouhani said he'd be sending Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the countries still in the deal - China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIran hopes the European Union will pass laws to protect European firms from any potential U.S. sanctions. EU officials have suggested they'll do what they can to salvage the agreement.\n\nStill, Rouhani made a point of stressing that Iran, at any time, could resume its nuclear program.\n\n'So if necessary, we can begin our industrial enrichment without any limitations,' the Iranian leader said. 'Until implementation of this decision, we will wait for some weeks and will talk with our friends and allies and other signatories of the nuclear deal, who signed it and who will remain loyal to it. Everything depends on our national interests.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning after the flag burning, parliament speaker Ali Larijani said responsibility for saving the deal fell on the EU and other world powers still in the accord.\n\n'The period is only a window in which the EU can prove if it has enough weight for settling down international issues or not?' he said.\n\nLarijani also urged the country's nuclear department to prepare for 'resumption of all aspects of nuclear activities.'\n\nThe head of Iran's parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said parliament is preparing to increase spending on the country's ballistic missile program.\n\nIran nuclear deal - what happens next?\n\nTrump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal abruptly restores harsh sanctions on Iran, an any companies which trades with it, meaning major companies in the U.S. and Europe could be hurt, too.\n\nThe sanctions seek to punish Iran for its nuclear program by limiting its ability to sell oil or do business overseas, affecting a wide range of Iranian economic sectors and individuals.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that licenses held by Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars in commercial jetliners to Iran will be revoked.\n\nNew rules: US President Donald Trump, seen here shaking hands with National Security Advisor John Bolton, will impose sanctions on Iran, and companies doing business with Iran, immediately\n\nCertain exemptions are to be negotiated, but Mnuchin refused to discuss what products might qualify.\n\nHe said the sanctions will sharply curtail sales of oil by Iran, which is currently the world's fifth largest oil producer.\n\nMnuchin said he didn't expect oil prices to rise sharply, forecasting that other producers will step up production.\n\nThe White House administration said it would re-impose sanctions on Iran immediately but allow grace periods for businesses to wind down activity.\n\nCompanies and banks doing business with Iran will have to scramble to extricate themselves or run afoul of the U.S. government.\n\nIn Iran, many are deeply concerned about how Trump's decision could affect the already struggling economy.\n\nIn Tehran, Rouhani sought to calm nerves, smiling as he appeared at a petroleum expo. He didn't name Trump directly, but emphasized that Iran continued to seek 'engagement with the world.'\n\nOne of Trump's criticisms of the deal has been the fact it does not address Iran's missile program.\n\nBoroujerdi said: 'With America's decision, Iran's missile program will not change at all.'\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard has welcomed Donald Trump's decision, saying it was clear from the beginning that the Americans were 'not trustworthy' and that the move would have no impact.\n\nThe semi-official Fars news agency quoted General Mohammad Ali Jafari as predicting that the EU, which opposed the pullout, would eventually join the U.S., meaning the 'the fate of the deal is clear.'\n\nHe is quoted as saying: 'We welcome Trump's decision on pulling out of the deal. This is not a new event and has no effective role in any field.' He added that 'it was clear that the Americans are not trustworthy.'\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard is a paramilitary force dominated by hard-liners, which answers directly to Iran's supreme leader.\n\nMany Iranians are worried about what Trump's decision could mean for their country.\n\nThe Iranian rial is already trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials. Many say they have not seen any benefits from the nuclear deal.\n\nIran's poor economy and unemployment sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested.\n\nTrump's decision to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal is dominating newspaper front pages and discussions across Iran, with some saying the accord will go on 'without the troublemaker.'\n\nIranian moderate newspapers on Wednesday sought to buoy embattled President Hassan Rouhani, with the daily newspaper Asr-e Eghtesad proclaiming: 'Iran's diplomacy has blunted Trump's blade.'\n\nIran's president Hassan Rouhani blasted Trump immediately after Tuesday's speech: 'Iran will be conferring with the world's two super powers, Russia and China,' he sniped, insisting that Trump's 'psychological war and economic pressures will not work'\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday that their countries will remain in the Iran nuclear deal and asked Trump to make sure the U.S. doesn't do anything that would keep them from participating in it\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency referred to Trump as 'the troublemaker.' Meanwhile, the hard-line daily Kayhan went with: 'Trump tears apart the nuclear deal; It is time to set it afire!'\n\nTrump said that the US now has 'definitive proof' that Iran was lying about its pursuit of nuclear weapons when it entered into the 2015 agreement.\n\nAnd he threatened Tehran's mullahs with new headaches if they resume their pursuit of a weapon of mass destruction.\n\n'If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before,' the president warned. 'It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.'\n\n'The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen: In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.'\n\nBarack Obama and his former secretary of state John Kerry both bashed Trump's decision, calling it unnecessary and wrongheaded.\n\nIranian president Hassan Rouhani responded, telling his country's state-run TV network: 'I have ordered Iran's atomic organization that whenever it is needed, we will start enriching uranium more than before.'\n\nRouhani said Iran would start ramping up production 'in the next weeks.'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama defended his signature foreign policy achievement as Trump tore it down on Tuesday\n\nRouhani blasted Trump immediately after Tuesday's speech.\n\n'Iran will be conferring with the world's two super powers, Russia and China,' he sniped, insisting that Trump's 'psychological war and economic pressures will not work.'\n\nLeaders of America's three staunchest European allies - France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Angela Merkel and the United Kingdom's Theresa May - issued a joint statement asking the US not to do anything that would prevent them from keeping the nuclear deal intact even without Washington's participation.\n\nIran 'continues to abide by the restrictions' of the deal,' the three leaders said, citing a statement from the International Atomic Energy Agency, adding that 'the world is a safer place as a result.'\n\n'Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement,' they said.\n\nThe president has been outspoken for nearly three years about the nuclear bargain that he called 'insane' and 'the worst deal in history.'\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, whose Cabinet department oversees economic sanctions against rogue regimes, said before Trump's speech that '[w]e will continue to work with our allies to build an agreement that is truly in the best interest of our long-term national security.'\n\nThe United States, he said, will cut off Iran's 'access to capital' to fund terrorism, 'its use of ballistic missiles against our allies, its support for the brutal Assad regime in Syria, its human rights violations against its own people, and its abuses of the international financial system.'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, whose administration inked the Iran deal, called Tuesday's pullback 'misguided.'\n\nWalking away from the deal, he said in a statement, 'turns our back on America's closest allies, and an agreement that our country's leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated.'\n\n'In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America's credibility, and puts us at odds with the world's major powers,' he added.\n\nObama cautioned that the agreement 'was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran. We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior - including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors.'\n\n'But that's precisely why it was so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' the former president said, articulating the central dispute in Washington over whether the deal was preventing Tehran's nuclear weapons development or enabling it.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama published an impassioned defense of the Iran deal, one of his many signature accomplishments that the Trump administration has undone, on Facebook shortly after his successor spoke to the nation\n\nTrump implied Tuesday that the Obama administration's best intentions were always bound to be steamrolled by Tehran's lies.\n\n'In theory, the so-called Iran deal was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime,' Trump declared.\n\n'In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium, and over time reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.'\n\nTrump said several times that the US will not under any circumstances allow Iran to join the ranks of nuclear nations - in no small part because of its belligerence toward America.\n\n'We will not allow a regime that chants 'Death to America' to gain access to the most deadly weapons on earth,' he sad.\n\nThe president added that he is reimposing the highest level of sanctions on Tehran, and the US will punish any country that helps Iran in its quest.\n\n'America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail,' Trump asserted in remarks from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton told reporters after Trump spoke that 'we're out of the deal.'\n\n'The only sure way to get on the path of stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons and delivery capabilities is to get out of the deal, and that's what the president has done,' he said.\n\nBolton said at the White House that sanctions would be snapped back into place on a rolling basis, with some segments of the pre-agreement situation returning quickly and others coming back in a matter of months.\n\nJOHN KERRY SAYS TRUMP'S DECISION 'BREAKS AMERICA'S WORD'\n\nFormer secretary of state John Kerry, who helped negotiate the Iran deal in 2015, slammed Trump's withdrawal as horrible foreign policy\n\n'Today's announcement weakens our security, breaks America's word, isolates us from our European allies, puts Israel at greater risk, empowers Iran's hardliners, and reduces our global leverage to address Tehran's misbehavior, while damaging the ability of future Administrations to make international agreements. No rhetoric is required. The facts speak for themselves.\n\n'Instead of building on unprecedented nonproliferation verification measures, this decision risks throwing them away and dragging the world back to the brink we faced a few years ago. The extent of the damage will depend on what Europe can do to hold the nuclear agreement together, and it will depend on Iran's reaction.\n\n'America should never have to outsource those stakes to any other country. This is not in America's interests. We should all hope the world can preserve the nuclear agreement.'\n\nNo new commercial contracts will be permitted between US trading partners and Tehran, he said.\n\nBut for existing contracts, 'there's a wind-down period to allow orderly termination.'\n\nAnd on the question of whether Trump's abandonment of the terms of the 2015 deal means the US is now in violation of it, Bolton responded: 'No, I don't think we're violating, I think we're withdrawing from it.'\n\nTehran says it's unwilling to enter into a new agreement with the US that addresses Trump's other complaints about the rogue regime's behavior, including its illicit financing of terrorism.\n\n'That's fine. I'd probably say the same thing if I were in their position,' Trump said Tuesday. 'But the fact is they are probably going to want to make a new and lasting deal. ... When they do I am ready willing and able.'\n\nProtesters stood outside the White House Tuesday as Trump announced the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal\n\nIt came as no surprise globally that Trump announced the United States' withdraw from the pact he inherited from the previous administration. The big unknown was what would happen next.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose nation's existence Iran threatens on a regular basis, called Trump's decision a 'historic move,' and said leaving the Iran deal intact would have been 'a recipe for disaster, a disaster for our region, a disaster for the peace of the world.'\n\nHe claimed Iran's level of aggression has grown since the Obama-era deal - especially in Syria, where Tehran is 'trying to establish military bases to attack Israel.'\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces issued a warning just minutes before Trump broadcast his message.\n\n'Following the identification of irregular activity of Iranian forces in Syria, the IDF has decided to change the civilian protection instructions in the Golan Heights and instructs local authorities to unlock and ready shelters in the area,' the forces' statement said.\n\n'The Israeli public should remain attentive to IDF instructions that will be given if necessary. Additionally, defense systems have been deployed and IDF troops are on high alert for an attack.'\n\nTrump said the US would impose new sanctions on countries that help Iran in its quest for a nuclear weapon but did not say what he would do to companies that may have unrelated business deals with the Islamist nation.\n\nWhite House legislative director Marc Short told DailyMail.com on Tuesday morning that the president 'wants to see Iran end its nuclear program but also become a nation that is not funding terrorism, not attacking Israel not looking to continue to attack allies that we have.\n\nPresident Donald Trump informed France's Emmanuel Macron in a phone call this morning that he will pull the U.S. out the nuclear deal it signed onto three years ago after intense negotiations with Tehran\n\n'I think he's looking for an agreement that brings Iran into the international community as opposed to being a rogue nation state that funds terrorism,' Short said during a press scrum on the driveway leading into the West Wing.\n\nTrump is anticipated to allow the oil sanctions that legally come up for discussion every 120 days under the deal to be reimposed on Tehran.\n\nThe sanctions cut Iran's oil exports in half in 2012, Foreign Policy reports, and crippled the Islamic Republic's economy.\n\nEuropean companies will have to choose, if the sanctions are slapped back on, whether they want to do business with the US or the taboo government, putting them in an undesirable position.\n\nTrump is said to have informed Macron in a phone call that he would be pulling the US out of the nuclear deal it signed onto three years ago after intense negotiations with Tehran.\n\nEUROPE RESPONDS TO TRUMP'S WITHDRAWAL FROM OBAMA'S IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron of France issued a statement following President Trump's remarks on Iran:\n\n'It is with regret and concern that we, the Leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom take note of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\n'Together, we emphasise our continuing commitment to the JCPoA. This agreement remains important for our shared security. We recall that the JCPoA was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council in resolution 2231. This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.\n\n'According to the IAEA, Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out by the JCPoA, in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world is a safer place as a result. Therefore we, the E3, will remain parties to the JCPoA. Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement.\n\n'We urge the US to ensure that the structures of the JCPoA can remain intact, and to avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal. After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPoA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements.\n\n'We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, cooperating fully and in a timely manner with IAEA inspection requirements. The IAEA must be able to continue to carry out its long-term verification and monitoring programme without restriction or hindrance. In turn, Iran should continue to receive the sanctions relief it is entitled to whilst it remains in compliance with the terms of the deal.\n\n'There must be no doubt: Iran's nuclear program must always remain peaceful and civilian. While taking the JCPOA as a base, we also agree that other major issues of concern need to be addressed. A long-term framework for Iran's nuclear programme after some of the provisions of the JCPOA expire, after 2025, will have to be defined. Because our commitment to the security of our allies and partners in the region is unwavering, we must also address in a meaningful way shared concerns about Iran's ballistic missile programme and its destabilising regional activities, especially in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. We have already started constructive and mutually beneficial discussions on these issues, and the E3 is committed to continuing them with key partners and concerned states across the region.\n\n'We and our Foreign Ministers will reach out to all parties to the JCPoA to seek a positive way forward. '\n\nTrump teased his Iran deal announcement in a Monday afternoon tweet that provided no hints at what it would be\n\nHe told Obama era Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday morning that he needs to butt out - or else\n\nTrump on Monday called Kerry's intervention 'possibly illegal' and blamed him for the current arrangement that gave Tehran sanctions relief but would allow it to build nuclear bombs as soon as 2027\n\nKerry (left) is seen with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in 2016; Kerry met with Zarif last month for secret talks about how to undermine Trump's bid to kill the nuclear deal\n\nTrump at a news conference last month rebuffed a reporter who asked about potential military action against Iran.\n\n'I don't talk about whether or not I would use military force,' Trump said at a joint presser with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n'But I can tell you this, they will not be doing nuclear weapons. That I can tell you. OK? They are not going to be doing nuclear weapons. You can bank on it.'\n\nNetanyahu has been pushing Trump to take a more aggressive posture toward Iran, his nation's most prolific antagonist.\n\nNetanyahu delivered a presentation last week claiming Israel's intelligence agency had proof that Iran 'lied' about its intention to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.\n\nTrump complained about the nuclear deal consistently during his campaign and harangued it as a 'very badly negotiated' agreement in a tweet Monday that took aim at the secretary of state who helped to broker it.\n\nThe comment followed his remarks at a news conference alongside Macron that the deal was made 'decayed foundations' and was not structured to last.\n\n'Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it,' Trump said.\n\nTrump has until May 12 to decide whether he wants to allow a sanctions waiver that applies to Tehran to expire.\n\nIf the sanctions go back into effect, the US will be in violation of the agreement effectively ending its participation in the deal it entered into with the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany.\n\nTrump has said he would be willing to sign on to a companion agreement that encompasses the nuclear aspects of the current one and applies new pressure to Iran to abandon its ballistic missiles program, end terrorist financing and broker a peace agreement between the ruling government and rebels in Syria.\n\nKerry has also been meeting with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (left) and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) in attempts to salvage the Iran deal\n\nKerry could run afoul of the Logan Act, a 200+ year-old federal law that made it a felony for civilians to conduct foreign policy without authorization\n\nTHE FULL SPEECH: TRUMP PULLS OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n'My fellow Americans: Today, I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n'The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al Qaeda.\n\n'Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American servicemembers, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens. The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.\n\n'No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.\n\n'In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran's nuclear program. This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.\n\n'In theory, the so-called 'Iran deal' was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime. In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.\n\n'The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.\n\n'In other words, at the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime -- and it's a regime of great terror -- many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash -- a great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.\n\n'A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn't. At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.\n\n'Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents long concealed by Iran, conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.\n\n'The fact is this was a horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.\n\n'In the years since the deal was reached, Iran's military budget has grown by almost 40 percent, while its economy is doing very badly. After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.\n\n'The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time. The deal's sunset provisions are totally unacceptable. If I allowed this deal to stand, there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.\n\n'Making matters worse, the deal's inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating, and don't even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities.\n\n'Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime's development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.\n\n'Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran's destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism. Since the agreement, Iran's bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen.\n\n'In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.\n\n'Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions. I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.\n\n'Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East. We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\n'After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.\n\n'The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.\n\n'Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n'In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction. Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.\n\n'America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And we will not allow a regime that chants 'Death to America' to gain access to the most deadly weapons on Earth.\n\n'Today's action sends a critical message: The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them. In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. Plans are being made. Relationships are building. Hopefully, a deal will happen and, with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone.\n\n'As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat. This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile program; to stop its terrorist activities worldwide; and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East. In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect. If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.\n\n'Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran: The people of America stand with you. It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage. Most of Iran's 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world.\n\n'But the future of Iran belongs to its people. They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land. And they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history, and glory to God.\n\n'Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal; they refuse. And that's fine. I'd probably say the same thing if I was in their position. But the fact is they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal, one that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people. When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.\n\n'Great things can happen for Iran, and great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East.\n\n'There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now.\n\n'Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.'\n\nFrance condemns Trump's decision on Iran and tells the US 'you are not the world's policeman' as Europe scrambles to save nuclear deal\n\nBy Sarah Malm and James Tapsfield, political editor for MailOnline\n\nFrance has condemned Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and vowed to ensure that the 2015 agreement is 'not dead'.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Trump had made a mistake and that the United States should not consider itself the world's 'economic policeman' as America reinstated financial sanctions on Iran.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, along with the UK and Germany, voiced a regret over Trump's decision and reinforced their commitment to the deal, words echoed by several nations, including China and Russia.\n\nPresident Macron is due to speak to his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani later today as EU leaders scramble to save the deal.\n\n'The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there,' French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian said.\n\nPresident Trump had previously fiercely criticised the Iran deal, which eased sanctions in exchange for commitments to abandon its nuclear weapons programme\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile said his country will remain in the deal, and will instead trade with the other countries which signed it\n\nLe Drian said France, like others, was well aware that there were concerns about issues other than nuclear capability, namely topics such as Iran's ballistic weapons programme, but added they too could be addressed without ditching the nuclear deal.\n\nLe Drian, interviewed just hours after the announcement by Trump, said Macron's contact with Rouhani would be followed by meetings next week, probably on Monday, involving the Iranians and European counterparts from France, Britain and Germany.\n\n'Yes, there is a real risk of confrontation,' he told RTL, regarding Trump's decision on Iran. 'I hope it will not be a setback for peace,' he added.\n\nLast night, Macron, along with Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel released a joint statement, in which they emphasised their 'continuing commitment' to the deal and said they regretted Trump's decision.\n\n'It is with regret and concern that we ... take note of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\n'We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.'\n\nIran meanwhile, has said it will remain in the deal, and will instead trade with the other countries which signed it.\n\nRules of the agreement: Behind the historic 2015 Iran nuclear deal\n\nIt remains unclear whether the US would choose to impose sanctions on countries, or foreign companies who chose to trade with Iran.\n\nIsrael, who has a fraught relationship with Iran and considers it hostile, applauded Trump's decision to withdraw, but otherwise words of praise for Trump have been few and far between.\n\nChina's said it regrets Trumps decision, and that pulling out of the deal raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East.\n\nA foreign ministry spokesman said China will safeguard the deal and it calls on all relevant parties to assume a responsible attitude.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the United States will be 'the loser' from Trump's move, while Russia's acting Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin remains committed to the Iran nuclear deal.", "The world has reacted with outrage after Donald Trump pulled the plug on US involvement in the Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\nHis White House Statement on Tuesday slammed the 2015 peace accords as 'disastrous', insisting they imposed 'no limits' on Iran's 'sinister' activities across the Middle East.\n\nThe decision sparked fury in Iran with politicians setting fire to the American flag, chanting 'Death to America' and accusing Trump of 'lacking mental capacity'.\n\nToday the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would wait for the day Trump dies and 'snakes and ants eat his corpse'.\n\nThe UK, France, Germany and Russia have condemned the 'regrettable' decision, with French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warning of a 'real risk of confrontation' if Europe doesn't act to counter Trump's 'rash' decision.\n\nMailOnline brings you all the latest updates here:\n\nRod Ardehali\n\nHost commentator\n\nLara Keay\n\nHost commentator\n\nAuto-update 18:59 Iranian economy bounces back\n\nTehran Stock Market shrugs off US departure from #Irandeal and return of US #sanctions with the index staying almost unchanged at 93691 (0.09% up) -- Amir Paivar (@AmirPaivar)\n\nMay 9, 2018\n\n18:11 Iranian rial tumbles after Trump quits nuclear deal\n\n'The dollar was being offered for as much as 75,000 rials, compared to around 65,000 just before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday night, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com, which tracks the free market.\n\n'Dealers in Tehran quoted similar levels on Wednesday, according to an Iranian economist outside the country who is in touch with them.

The leaders also urged Iran 'to show restraint in response to the decision by the US'.\n\nThey said: 'It is with regret and concern that we, the Leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom take note of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States of America from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.'\n\nIn a much anticipated statement from the White House, Mr Trump said: 'If I allowed this deal to stand there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\n\n'Everyone would want their weapons ready by the time Iran had theirs.\n\n'We cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotting structure of the current agreement. The Iran deal is defective at its core.'\n\nHe went on: 'If we do nothing we know exactly what will happen.\n\n'In just a short period of time the world's leading state sponsor of terror would be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.'\n\nThe deal was signed by world powers in 2015. Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in return for eased economic sanctions.\n\nTehran claimed at the time it had been pursuing only nuclear energy rather than weapons.\n\nPresident Trump said that since the agreement 'Iran's bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen'. He said that the deal 'didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will'.\n\nAt PMQs today, Theresa May said she had made her position 'clear' to Donald Trump before he announced his decision - and pledged to keep trying to win him over to the merits of a pact\n\nMrs May joined French president Emmanuel Macron (left) and Angela Merkel of Germany (right) last night in voicing regret over Mr Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal\n\nThe President pointed out that Iran - a regime of 'great terror' had boosted its military spend, supported terrorism and 'caused havoc' throughout the Middle East and beyond.\n\nControversial Iran deal that Trump tears up after calling it 'horrible'\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal was an agreement signed between Iran, the US, UK, Russia, France, China, and Germany.\n\nThe deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in return for limitations to the country's nuclear energy programme, which many feared would be used to create a nuclear weapon.\n\nUnder the deal, Iran agreed to keep its uranium enrichment levels at no more than 3.67 per cent, down from almost 20 per cent.\n\nThe country's uranium stockpile was also to be kept at under 300 kilograms, which Mr Obama said would see a reduction of 98 per cent.\n\nTehran also agreed to redesign a heavy-water nuclear facility it had been building that was capable of producing plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe reactor would no longer produce any weapons-grade plutonium and no additional heavy-water reactors were to be built for 15 years.\n\nIn order to ensure Iran stuck to the deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted greater access and information regarding the country's nuclear programme.\n\nThe agency was also given powers to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities as well as having access to the supply chain that supports Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nMeasures were put in place to ensure the 'break-out time' - the amount of time it would take Iran to create a nuclear bomb - was slowed dramatically, while its government agreed not to engage in activities, including research and development, that it would need to make one.\n\nIn return, the lifting of sanctions meant Iran stood to gain access to more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas.\n\nIt was also able to resume selling oil on international markets and use the global financial system for trade.\n\nBut if the country was to violate any part of the deal, it was agreed that UN sanctions would 'snap back' into place for 10 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension.\n\nHe said he had talked to France, Germany, the UK and friends across the Middle East and said they were 'unified' in their conviction Iran must never deliver nuclear weapons.\n\nHe went on: 'America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail.\n\n'The US no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises I keep them.' He said he would be open to a new deal in the future.\n\nIn a statement immediately afterwards, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said there was a 'short time' to negotiate with the countries remaining in the nuclear deal.\n\nHe warned his country could start enriching uranium more than ever in the coming weeks.\n\nMr Rouhani spoke live on Iranian state television. He said he would send Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to countries remaining in the accord.\n\nHe said: 'I have ordered Iran's atomic organisation that whenever it is needed, we will start enriching uranium more than before.'\n\nHe said Iran would start this 'in the next weeks'.\n\nThe UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was deeply concerned by the US decision to withdraw from the deal.\n\nThe EU's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said the EU wanted to preserve the deal.\n\nShe said: 'The European Union is determined to preserve it [the deal].\n\n'Together with the rest of the international community, we will preserve this nuclear deal.'\n\n'The nuclear deal with Iran is crucial for the security of the region, of Europe and of the entire world.'\n\nMr Macron tweeted: 'The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake.'\n\nTensions were already heightened in the region after Mr Netanyahu announced that Israeli spies had stolen thousands of files on Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nIsrael has also struck Iranian forces in Syria several times in recent weeks.\n\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson had travelled to Washington on Saturday where he made a last-ditch bid to prevent the US pullout.\n\nMr Johnson said Mr Trump would be in line for the Nobel Peace Prize if he can sort out the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nEarlier in the day the Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council said Iran would not be 'passive' if President Trump left the nuclear deal.\n\nHe said: 'It will not be in the American's interests if the JCPOA (Iran's nuclear deal) collapses by their offensive...\n\n'We will not be passive if the United States starts confrontation with Iran.'\n\nMr Trump has previously condemned the Iran accord signed by his predecessor Mr Obama as 'insane' and the 'worst deal ever'.\n\nScrapping it was a commitment he made during his election campaign.\n\nMrs May spoke to Mr Trump on the phone over the weekend. Then Mr Johnson yesterday urged the President not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater' by walking away.\n\nHe accepted the agreement was not perfect but warned that there was not a better alternative.\n\nOn Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would rather face a military confrontation with Iran 'now than later'.\n\nHe said his country was prepared for a war to stop Iranian forces embedding in neighbouring Syria.\n\nMr Netanyahu said: 'We are determined to block Iran's aggression against us even if this means a struggle.

Mark Hughes, once of United but more recently City, thinks the team he started to build before Roberto Mancini took over might now have the measure of their Manchester neighbours.\n\nHe questions Mancini's 'autocratic' style and suggests it might not necessarily have helped matters in the mess that is the latest Carlos Tevez affair. A situation he says would never have arisen had he still been in charge.\n\nCrossing the divide: Mark Hughes was a playing legend for United and joined City as manager in 2008 before being replaced 22 months ago\n\nBut does he consider City capable of matching United, stride for stride, in what promises to be a fascinating Barclays Premier League title race? 'Without a shadow of a doubt,' he says.\n\n'City have incredible depth. In Europe, in the Champions League, I don't think they can get to where they want to be either this season or the next. Because you have to build that knowledge and United improved year on year by playing in the competition.\n\n'But in the Premier League it can happen much more quickly. They have players who understand the Premier League. They have foreign players who have been there for a few seasons; top players like Vincent Kompany and Nigel de Jong. They understand what's required. In terms of what they have, it stands comparison with any team in the league.'\n\nNo problems: Hughes enjoyed a positive relationship with Carlos Tevez during their time together at City\n\nHughes is holding court in a smart Italian restaurant in Mayfair, and giving his first proper interview since leaving Fulham in the summer.\n\nHe explains what seemed a strange decision and why he would like to return to football the moment the right challenge presents itself.\n\nTo do so, he has even been improving his Spanish, while those who would hope to assist him in a new role have been studying other languages to increase the options of Team Hughes.\n\nHe also reflects on his time at City, articulating his thoughts on the man who succeeded him as well as the Argentina striker he chose to defend over that recent touchline controversy in Munich. He does share an adviser with Tevez but he thinks it must be difficult for any player to operate under Mancini's strict regime.\n\nFirst, though, he looks forward rather than back, to what promises to be a momentous encounter at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nIf he can see a significant difference between the teams, it is something in United that might not yet exist at the Etihad Stadium: the mentality of the team, a collective spirit that has provided the foundation on which United's success has been built under Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\n'Whether or not the group at City, as a whole, work as diligently and with the same mantra as United, I don't know,' he says. 'I'd suggest maybe not.\n\n'Every Manchester United player understands what United is about. The players understand it is a privilege to play for United. They show the club that deference.\n\n'I'm not sure the group of players at City understand that yet. A lot of people have come together very quickly. At United there has been continuity, with the manager, with the success they have had. It gives them a different dynamic.'\n\nMy way or the highway: Hughes describes his successor Roberto Mancini as an autocrat\n\nSo how does he feel about the man City brought in to replace him 22 months ago? 'I don't know the guy personally,' he says. 'But looking at him from the outside, he comes across as autocratic. It's either his way or the highway and I think it's more difficult to be like that in the modern age with modern footballers.\n\n'You have to understand that your decisions can have an impact on players. I'm not sure he indulges players, tries to get to know them or understand them. I'm not sure he's that type of manager.\n\n'To be honest, there's not a wrong or right way of doing things and, at the end of the day, it comes down to results.\n\n'He looks very focused and very driven in terms of what he gets from his players. But will they all love him when he leaves? I would think probably not. And only time will tell if the potential of the group he has is realised.'\n\nBut what about Tevez? In the television studio that night Hughes took the opposing view to Graeme Souness, who condemned the City striker for allegedly refusing to come on as a second-half substitute against Bayern Munich.\n\n'You judge people on how you find them, and the relationship you have with them, and during the time I had him as a player he was fantastic,' says Hughes.\n\nHappy days: Hughes takes over at Eastlands in 2008\n\n'He wasn't fit, and perhaps if he had been I might still be in a job there. But Carlos as a guy was fine.\n\n'We were in South Africa when he first trained with us and straight away you saw his quality in terms of what he could add to the team. You could see he was a world-class footballer and I was absolutely delighted that I was getting the chance to work with him.\n\n'It surprises me now, the issue he has. I guess these things happen in football. He is strong-willed. But one of the reasons he left United was because he wanted to play more often. He wasn't playing regularly. He's a guy who has come through life the hard way and there is still this genuine desire to play week in, week out.\n\n'I never saw him as volatile. I can't think of one incident where there were flashpoints with Carlos. That's not to say it wouldn't have happened. Actually, I take that back because it would never have happened under my watch.\n\n'If you have that (autocratic) style of management then the likelihood of having clashes with players is, on the law of averages, going to be more prevalent than managers who try to get the best out of players doing it the other way.\n\n'Roberto is in a position where he can simply take the player out of the equation. He can stop using them. But at a lesser level you cannot just write off players because you might need them the next week.'\n\nBest of enemies: Hughes misses his rivalry with United boss Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nWhile there is a hint of bitterness - he says he was 'devastated' to lose his job because it was an opportunity to prove that another British manager beyond Ferguson could succeed at the highest level - Hughes still reflects on his time at City with satisfaction.\n\nIt was insane at times, his one meeting with Sheik Mansour was particularly memorable, but he says people are now enjoying 'the gain' from his 'pain'. That he laid those first important bricks and was part of 'a unique moment in City's history'.\n\nHis greatest disappointment, however, is the feeling that he allowed himself to become 'compromised'.\n\n'I compromised myself by allowing things to happen that I was not comfortable with,' he says.\n\n'I was trying to buy into the City thing and the approach, trying to move the club forward, but there were certain things I wasn't comfortable with and I allowed them to happen under my watch.\n\n'It really came down to Brian Marwood's role (football administration officer). The way it was sold to me was that I was still in charge of football things. But I'm presented with this dotted line, shown all sorts of charts and I thought, \"What the hell's all this?\" I have an understanding of business and business models. But sometimes, really, it's about your relationships with people; that's the strength of your football club.\n\nNew era: Hughes talks to City Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak following the takeover by Sheik Mansour\n\n'Bringing in all these business people and business consultants to tell people what to do, and how to structure their club, wasn't right. But it was my own fault because I allowed it to happen. At the time I just wanted the club to succeed and you could see that the train was going in the right direction.'\n\nDid he see his dismissal coming? 'You got an inkling because people weren't around,' he says with a smile. 'People were going away on trips. I was thinking, \"Where is everybody? Where's the press officer?\" She wasn't around. On the day of the Sunderland game, people were phoning me up and saying I was going to be sacked after the game.\n\n'The fact that I still took the game is also what I'm talking about in terms of compromising myself.'\n\nThat one meeting with Sheik Mansour was memorable for the fact that he conducted the entire conversation with an olive stone in his mouth - 'I thought it would be rude to spit it out but I'm sure he thought I had some kind of speech impediment,' he says - while Arabian stallions were being paraded around them.\n\nHe saw it coming: Hughes waves farewell to the City fans after his final match in charge in December 2009\n\nBut he enjoyed the public jousts he had with Ferguson and even admitted to finding that 'Welcome to Manchester' poster which so incensed his former manager 'quite funny'.\n\n'I was at United, two years in Barcelona aside, from when I was 14 to 31,' he says. 'But people forget where City were. I was forever being asked how we were going to attract players when we were a mid-table team.\n\n'We had to fight, and the fact is as soon as he sees you as a threat your relationship with Alex changes. But I probably get on better with him now than I ever have. As a player I was just happy he picked me.'\n\nHughes seemed happy at Fulham. Until, that is, he rejected the opportunity to extend his contract and left in June.\n\nIt was thought he was doing so because he had another job lined up. Then, when that job did not materialise, the decision to leave Craven Cottage was seen as something of a disaster.\n\nHughes would like to put the record straight. 'The assumption that I was jumping ship because I had another job to jump into was wrong,' he says.\n\n'That was not the case because it was never there for me. People assumed I was hoping to get the Aston Villa job but that was never the case.\n\n'I simply felt my ambition for where I wanted to take the club was not being matched. Historically, Fulham were a club who were happy to be in the Premier League and that was their ambition. But it was not my ambition for them.\n\n'Conversations I was having about players I wanted to bring in were not going well. I read that as them maybe not wanting to keep Fulham in the top half of the Premier League.\n\nFalse smile: Fulham Chairman Mohamed Al Fayed welcomes Hughes to Craven Cottage but the relationship didn't last long\n\n'There was the date of June 1 (when his contract needed to be renewed) and the closer it got, the less inclined I was to sign it because it would have meant me committing further than the one year I had left.\n\n'I had real concerns about the age of certain players and I came to the conclusion that it would be better just to shake hands and walk away. Fulham were probably a bit too honest with me. They were saying, \"We know exactly what you're about, Mark, but really we are just quite happy to stay in the Premier League\".'\n\nBut Hughes says he will be back. 'I regret not being in a job at this time of year,' he says. 'That's the animal I am.\n\n'I am comfortable with the decision I made and I am fortunate to be in a position where I can just walk away. I said when I left Man City that I didn't want to compromise myself in terms of decisions that I made.\n\n'I'm a manager and that's what I feel I should be doing. I shouldn't be in the house cleaning the kitchen floor.'\n\nPresumably he'll put his mop down come 1.30pm on Sunday.", "Roberto Martinez - the man who shook up the season\n\nBy Matt Lawton for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 18:50 EDT, 20 April 2012 | Updated: 05:01 EDT, 21 April 2012\n\nThere is a room at Wigan Athletic's training ground that Roberto Martinez has covered, wall-to-wall, in photographs. On two walls are black-and-white portraits of 50 players, each one marking their first international appearance while at the club. Opposite these are photographs recording the first goals that players have scored in a Wigan shirt.\n\nBut it is the international wall of fame that highlights how far Wigan have come in such a short space of time. The club was founded in 1932 but not until Roy Carroll kept goal for Northern Ireland against Thailand in May 1997 could they claim to have an international on their books. Martinez borrowed the idea from Barcelona and Bayern Munich.\n\nWall of fame: Martinez says his players are making history at Wigan\n\n'You'll see it at other clubs, too,' says a Catalan who raves as much about 'the Real Madrid team of Toshack' as he does 'the Cruyff revolution at Barcelona'.\n\nHe explains: 'We are making history here and I want the players to realise that. Other clubs have more to look back on, but this is the best time this club has known and 50 years down the line, I want these players to be the reference point; something to inspire the future generations.\n\n'It's important they realise what they are doing for this club. Last week was the first time we had beaten Manchester United. It was the first time we had even taken a point off them. We have international players and I want them to take pride in playing for Wigan Athletic. I want them to understand what they mean to the supporters. I don't want people coming here just to use Wigan as a vehicle into the Premier League.'\n\nMartinez has his own history with the club and has surrounded himself with similar individuals. Graham Barrow was the manager when a 22-year-old Martinez joined in 1995 and he is now a member of the coaching staff, while one-time 'golden boot winner' Graeme Jones is his assistant.\n\n'I want people who understand this club,' says Martinez. 'As a manager you need to run a football club as if you are going to be here for 100 years. You need to lay foundations for the people who follow you.\n\nInner sanctum: Martinez wants his players and staff to understand the club\n\n'Many decisions I'm making now I may not enjoy the benefit of. I hate going into a place where you need to start from scratch. It shouldn't be like that. A manager cannot be in a place forever. It is impossible. But I would like to think that at Swansea, I put things in place that have allowed the club to grow stronger. I don't believe in short-term success.'\n\nMartinez is sitting behind his desk in an office that the majority of his Premier League contemporaries would probably liken to a broom cupboard. 'But now we own the land, the training ground is going to be developed,' he says with a real sense of excitement.\n\nHe does have a rather smart espresso machine, not dissimilar to the one Carlo Ancelotti had installed in the manager's office at Chelsea's Cobham training ground, but it would be interesting to know how many top managers have the kind of facility Martinez now has at his own home.\n\nIt is there, it seems, in a state-of-the-art cinema room, that much of Martinez's work is done; there where he came up with a system for his team that has enabled them to conquer United and Arsenal, lifting Wigan out of the bottom three.\n\nHe will watch the recording of a Wigan match as many as 10 times, particularly when they lose. He says he cannot move on until he is satisfied that he understands exactly why they lost.\n\n'I have all the facilities at home,' he says.\n\nAchievement: Martinez masterminded Wigan's first victory over Manchester United\n\n'I have a 60-inch pen-touch screen that allows you to write on it. You link it to your computer so it becomes a 60-inch computer screen really and you can use the ProZone software with it.\n\n'My wife was delighted when I had it installed, but she understands that I need that space and time to be able to come back to being myself. Once I find a solution, I'm fine.\n\n'You learn more from defeats. You see how players react to situations. I don't see it as work. I see being a football manager as a way to live. The moment you feel you need a day off, you are in the wrong business.'\n\nIt was during the hours of analysis, during what proved a particularly difficult first few months of the season, that Martinez arrived at the 3-4-3 formation which is working so well for his team.\n\n'It probably took until November to get there,' he says.\n\n'We lost two very important players in Tom Cleverley and Charles N'Zogbia last summer and we were struggling to create goalscoring opportunities. But we now play a system that is designed to get the best out of our players. It's a system that has been made here to play the best we can with the players we have.\n\n'I did something similar at Swansea. Everyone played 4-4-2 but we couldn't compete like that with the budget restrictions we had. So we started with 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3, and it gave us a lot of success.\n\n'Here we are now very well balanced. We are organised defensively and we are creating opportunities. It's not a case of the players adapting to a system. It's adapting to a system that suits our players.\n\nFocused: Martinez leaves nothing to chance\n\n'It helps that we have a very young group. It might lack experience but it has real energy. We also went to Anfield and won the game. We went to Chelsea and really we beat them. We are very flexible. We have been working so much in the past two-and-a-half years, tactically, and we can adapt to the demands of different games against different teams. We focus on the small details and see how we can make strong partnerships on the pitch. That's how you arrive at a system that works.'\n\nOff the field, too, this 38-year-old manager seems to have a system that works. Martinez is an intelligent guy. He studied and qualified as a physiotherapist when still in Spain and continued his studies once he arrived at Wigan, gaining a post-graduate diploma in business and marketing at Manchester University.\n\nIn his role as a manager he puts both to good use. 'I was always interested in trying to understand the business side of football so I went to university in Manchester a year after I arrived at Wigan to play,' he says. 'I enjoyed it and I also did it to develop a better understanding of English. I wanted to be able to think in English, instead of having to translate in my head all the time.\n\n'The physiotherapy was more a promise to my mother. There was no guarantee I was going to earn a living in football and she wanted me to have an alternative.\n\n'I was six months into doing my hospital hours when I moved to England. But it really helped me to understand my body when I was playing and to understand injuries and how the body can recover. I was never injured for more than nine weeks in 16 years of professional football.\n\n'I've always been fascinated by different techniques and I look at what the best physios in the world are doing. I love that side of football. Injury prevention. Maximising physical ability. The treatment of injuries. I always believe every injury can be avoided. That's my starting point and my staff believe the same.\n\nStunner: Wigan's Franco Di Santo scores against Arsenal\n\n'You get accidents in football, collisions that cause injuries that can't be avoided. But even then if your body is right it will react quicker to the treatment and recover faster. I don't believe in soft-tissue injuries. If you get a soft-tissue injury in football, a mistake has been made. It could be the training programme, a lifestyle problem. Whatever it is, it will be a mistake.\n\n'At this club we are below the average for injuries in the Premier League. It's important. It helps.'\n\nIt also helps that Martinez has such a strong bond with his chairman. Dave Whelan can occasionally appear a little too candid, as he was in the wake of a recent defeat to Swansea when he said he would be talking to his manager on the Monday morning.\n\nBut Martinez meets Whelan almost every Monday and there is a mutual respect and loyalty. This has been evident when Wigan have flirted dangerously with relegation and when Martinez turned down the opportunity to become Aston Villa's manager last summer.\n\n'I have a huge admiration for the chairman,' he says. 'When I arrived here the first time in 1995 he said he would do three things and he has delivered.\n\n'He said he would build a 20,000 all-seater stadium, that we would be in the Premier League in 10 years and that he was in this for the long-term.\n\n'He was very much involved in my arrival here. He opened five JJB stores in Spain and the general manager of those five shops was based in Zaragoza, where I had been playing, and everything came through that.\n\n'The chairman was looking to inject a bit of flair into the team and I was one of three Spanish players he brought over. Once we arrived in Wigan he treated the three of us like sons. He opened the doors of his house. It was an incredible experience.\n\n'I had the pleasure of playing for six years with him and I could see what the club meant to him. When he offered me the opportunity to become the manager, he said, \"Whatever happens you are going to get three years of work. If you get relegated it's my mistake for appointing you but you'll have to get us out of the division if we do go down\".\n\n'When someone says something like that, and they are as supportive and as loyal as they are, you can't walk away after two years. It would have been wrong to go to Aston Villa.\n\n'It was not a football decision. It was a human decision. It was my turn to show loyalty and support. And the manager should leave only when he feels the football club needs a new manager.'\n\nRight now that would not appear to be the situation at Wigan.", "Podolski: I moved to Arsenal to fight for Premier League titles\n\nBy Matt Lawton for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 22:45 BST, 28 September 2012 | Updated: 07:58 BST, 29 September 2012\n\nLukas Podolski delivers a candid assessment of his performances thus far at Arsenal. 'It is too early to say \"Podolski is a hero\",' he says.\n\n'After only five or six games you cannot say \"he's the best player and Arsenal are great\". I don't like this.\n\n'After 20 matches and we have lost six matches everyone will be saying Arsenal is rubbish and Podolski is rubbish. We must wait. I signed for 4 years. Not for 5 or 6 matches.'\n\nFighter: Lukas Podolski wants to win Premier League titles with Arsenal\n\nYou can see why people at Arsenal seem to like this guy, and why they claim he has energised the place since arriving from Cologne in the summer.\n\nHe walks into the press room at Arsenal's training ground and makes a beeline for three German journalists he recognises. There are hugs and high-fives; a genuine sense of warmth.\n\nWhen a photographer offers to show him the digital images he has just taken of him, Podolski studies them intently with a friendly hand on the guy's shoulder. 'Oh no, not that one,' he pleads.\n\nHe suddenly breaks into an anecdote about Michael Schumacher, his close friend and someone who grew up just five minutes from Podolski's humble family home.\n\nArms stretched out in front of him with hands gripping an imaginary steering wheel, Podolski starts describing how it felt to be travelling sideways at 120mph in Schumacher's Mercedes. A devilish grin on one German's face, a grimace on the other.\n\nHis English is excellent. 'I taught myself while in hotels on away trips and with the national team,' he explains proudly.\n\n'You get a lot of free time.' He slips in a quick apology. 'If you remember I scored in Bloemfontein,' he says. 'Sorry England.'\n\nHe does then add that Germany were 'the better team that day' during the 2010 World Cup and it is hard to argue.\n\n'England were strong,' he adds. 'Lots of fight, lots of heart. But I think we played the better football.\n\n'But then I thought Bayern Munich were the better team in the Champions League final and Chelsea won. That is football.'\n\nFootball was Podolski's salvation. The son of Polish parents, they emigrated to Germany when he was two-years-old having been given Aussiedler status.\n\nThis was granted due to the fact that Podolski's paternal grandparents were German citizens prior to the Second World War, because their home town of Gliwice - known as Gleiwitz before 1945 - was then part of Germany.\n\nGet in: Podolski has impressed since arriving in London\n\nGOAL MACHINE\n\n2002-2006 Cologne\n\nAppearances: 87 Goals: 51\n\n2006-2009 B Munich\n\nAppearances: 108 Goals: 26\n\n2009-2012 Cologne\n\nAppearances: 96 Goals: 35\n\n2012-?

Every day I played at the stadium. It was one minute from my house.\n\n'You see the buildings when you drive to the stadium. When you come from Poland you have nothing.\n\n'Your mother and father are working. You have only a bed for sleep. You have a kitchen and that's it. You must fight.\n\n'I was lucky to have this stadium near the house; somewhere I could play football.\n\n'It was tough for my family. My father was working, my mother was working. Sometimes I was alone at home after leaving school. My sister might cook something. Or I might go to buy something.\n\n'But then I went straight to play football with friends, to play on the pitch.'\n\nHe was blessed with athletic ability. His father, Waldemar, was a first division player in Poland who would then secure a place in the side at Bergheim.\n\n'I remember watching him,' says Podolski. 'During half-time I would run around on the pitch.'\n\nHe says his speed and strength actually comes from his mother, Krystyna, however.\n\n'She was a top handball player,' he says, and she was; she played for Poland.\n\nHad it not been for football, he says, he would have ended up 'on the street'.\n\nOff they went: Podolski admits it would be better had Robin van Persie (left) and Alex Song (right) stayed\n\nThe replacements: Santi Cazorla (left) and Olivier Giroud (right) have been drafted in at the Emirates\n\nThe stadium at Bergheim was his sanctuary and it is why he now offers financial support to a club that plays in the ninth tier of German football.\n\nAt the Lukas Podolski Sportpark he has had pitches relaid, changing rooms rebuilt. He talks to the manager, Ingo Haselback, every day.\n\nThey discuss players and potential transfer targets. 'I love this place,' he says.\n\nIt was while playing at Bergheim, when he was 10 or 11-years-old, that he was first spotted by a scout at nearby Cologne.\n\n'Cologne was my big team, my favourite team,' he says. 'I trained one week in Cologne and they asked me to sign for Cologne.\n\n'At 17 or 18 the coach asked me to go the first-team training ground. I was lucky to have that coach.\n\n'I made very quick progress. It was the guy who is the current national coach of Austria, Marcel Koller.\n\n'He called me and I went into his office. He said: \"You are very good, you come to the training camp for one week.\"\n\n'Then I trained for a lot of weeks in the team. In the first match against Hamburg I was in the squad and it was quick. My first game for the national team also came quick.'\n\nIt came when he was just 19, and despite having 'two hearts' - one for Germany, the other for Poland - he accepted Rudi Voller's invitation to play for Germany against Hungary on June 6 2004.\n\nIt would be the first of the 103 international caps he has so far amassed. A remarkable achievement for a player who is only 27.\n\nJoin me: Podolski (left) joined fellow German Per Mertesacker in north London\n\nSettling in: Podolski has adapted to life in London quickly\n\nHe would make one appearance as a substitute at Euro 2004, but at the World Cup in 2006 he was prominent among the stars.\n\nAs well as the three goals that helped Jurgen Klinsmann's side progress to the semi-finals, he would be voted the young player of the tournament ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThat summer Podolski also signed for Bayern Munich, but three years there proved largely frustrating for this gifted, versatile left-footed forward.\n\nNot least because the subsequent signing of Luca Toni would limit his opportunities in the team.\n\nPodolski reflects with some honesty on that particular period of his career but with no great bitterness.\n\n'I don't really know what happened at Bayern Munich,' he says. 'It was hard for me, you don't play a lot of matches.\n\n'The coaches don't give me the chances to play and show how good I am for Bayern Munich.\n\n'There is a big difference, moving from the second division to the biggest club in Germany.\n\n'It was difficult. I was 20 or 21 at a big club. I had not played for a big club like Bayern. I knew I could play better for Bayern but I left and went back to Cologne because football for me is fun.\n\n'When you go to a club and always sit on the bench and look at the team it is not easy. I didn't have enough chances to show the coach how I played, so I moved on.'\n\nHe is passionate about Cologne. The tattoo on his right arm says as much. But a second spell there did not quite go to plan either.\n\nTwo thumbs up: The German sent his mother, father and a friend to check Arsenal out before deciding on a move\n\n'I had options to go to Italy, England and other clubs in Germany,' he says. 'But I wanted to go back to Cologne to help change the club.\n\n'They said they wanted to build a team around me and to play in the top five or six in the Bundesliga.\n\n'But after three years I realised it was not a good decision because they did nothing to build a team around me.\n\n'I went back because it is my town, my club, I love the club. I wanted to change things.\n\n'The manager and the president said things but after three years I saw nothing. I was a little bit angry about this because you see the stadium, the people are crazy about football. I left. I had an offer from Arsenal, this great club that plays in the Champions League. I had to go.'\n\nHe dispatched a party of trusted advisers to London to check out Arsenal.\n\n'My wife, my father and my friend Nassim came here to see the training ground and the stadium,' he says.\n\n'I was at the Euros. I couldn't tell the Germany coach I needed a couple of days to go to London.\n\n'But they were very impressed. My dad said the place was fantastic, and I was happy with that. I was left with the feeling that Arsenal was a great club.'\n\nDid the seven trophyless seasons prior to his arrival concern him?\n\nRemember this? Podolski scored when Germany knocked England out of the South Africa World Cup in 2010\n\n'It's not important only to win the trophies,' he says. 'We will fight for the Premier League. We will fight against Chelsea this weekend.\n\n'But it was not important for me when I signed. I wasn't saying \"oh, they've won nothing for seven years. I don't go there\". I like this club. I like the people here.\n\n'I like the way they play football. You come to a new club and a new league and you never know how it will start. How the team plays.\n\n'But I felt easy here from the first training session. Everyone was so helpful. The club helped me. The style of football is the kind I like. One or two touches. Quick passing. Fast at the front.\n\n'In the offence I like to play with Cazorla. You see this in the matches. I am looking for him and he is looking for me. I like playing with him. I can't understand why he was playing for Villarreal and Malaga and not a bigger team earlier.\n\n'I'm looking forward to playing the next four years with him.'\n\nHe agrees that 'it would have been better' had Robin Van Persie and Alex Song stayed.\n\n'But we have Cazorla and Giroud now,' he says. 'Great players have left but we have to look forward.'\n\nDid he look forward to that first day at training? Was Arsene Wenger waiting to welcome him to London Colney?\n\n'He doesn't wait with flowers for me, \"Podolski, you are here!\" No, no.' Enough said.\n\nWith the big boys: Podolski played a part as Arsenal grabbed a point at the Etihad against Manchester City", "'I don't know if he will be able to come out': Mourinho admits 20-day Sanchez absence from US tour would be 'really bad' for Manchester United Louis van Gaal pushing for swift Man United deal to head off threat from Ryan Giggs\n\nBy Matt Lawton for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 17:30 EDT, 27 April 2014 | Updated: 02:14 EDT, 28 April 2014\n\nIt is with good reason that Louis van Gaal is pushing for Manchester United to confirm him as their next manager. The deal, say senior sources at the club, is all but done after talks last week.\n\nBut however confident Van Gaal might appear in his ability as a manager, he knows that four straight wins for Ryan Giggs will heighten the desire -- not least among the fans -- to see him given the job on a permanent basis.\n\nThere is also the danger of Carlo Ancelotti coming back into the reckoning. United continue to consider him out of their reach, but lose heavily at Bayern Munich in the second leg of his Real Madrid side's Champions League semi-final tomorrow night and the Italian might yet become available.\n\nDutch of class: Louis van Gaal wants his Manchester United offer tied up to avoid competition from rivals\n\nContenders: Ryan Giggs and Carlo Ancelotti are also in the running for the Old Trafford hotseat\n\nVAN GAAL'S CUP RECORD\n\nClubs Managed\n\nAjax (1991-97), Barcelona (1997-2000, 2002-03), AZ Alkmaar (2005-09), Bayern Munich (2009-11)\n\nCountries Managed\n\nHolland (2000-02, 2012 - )\n\nClub Honours\n\nLeague Titles 7\n\nChampions League 1\n\nUEFA Cup 1\n\nDomestic Cups 7\n\nOther European Cups 3\n\nThis is something the United hierarchy are aware of, but the focus remains on a 62-year-old Dutchman who is in a position to devote a bit of thinking time to United before he turns his full attention to Holland's World Cup campaign.\n\nFor now, Giggs is the only real alternative, but for all the excitement of United's 4-0 win over Norwich, a sharp sense of reality remains in the boardroom.\n\nGiggs was understandably thrilled, as was Sir Alex Ferguson, but Old Trafford's power brokers know things could get uncomfortable for them if Giggs wins the next three games.\n\nDrving ambition: Van Gaal plays golf on holiday in Portugal as he waits on the final details of his United deal\n\nLocal hero: Giggs would be many United fans' favourite to take over from sacked David Moyes\n\nThe pressure to stick with him -- and his class of '92 staff -- could become intense.It's why it would make sense to get Van Gaal to put pen to paper in the next few days, even if there remains a degree of uncertainty about who would be his deputies.\n\nIt appears that Van Gaal would accommodate Giggs as well as someone like Patrick Kluivert. But there is no guarantee, say sources, that Giggs would accept such a role. He is very much his own man, as are Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville.\n\nIf Van Gaal wants them to be part of United's future, he might need to demonstrate a bit of charm as well as strong leadership qualities.\n\nBright start: United kicked off Giggs' temporary reign as boss with a 4-0 victory over Norwich", "'I don't know if he will be able to come out': Mourinho admits 20-day Sanchez absence from US tour would be 'really bad' for Manchester United Manchester United in talks with adidas over world record \u00a360m-per-year kit dealGerman sportswear giants adidas in pole position to clinch a world record kit deal with Manchester United\n\nA \u00a360million-a-year has all but been agreedNike's deal expires in June 2015 - they will decide if it is worth more than doubling their current deal which cost \u00a3300m for 10 yearsNegotiations with Nike have been going on for three years but their exclusive negotiating period expired last autumn\n\nBy Matt Lawton for the Daily Mail and Charles Sale for MailOnline\n\nPublished: 10:15 EDT, 6 May 2014 | Updated: 11:08 EDT, 6 May 2014\n\nAdidas are in pole position to clinch a world record kit deal with Manchester United.\n\nSenior insiders at the German sportswear giant believe a \u00a360million-a-year deal has all but been agreed, even though current sponsors Nike retain the right to match any offer and extend a partnership that dates back to 2002 with United.\n\nThat, however, is thought to be unlikely when Nike are sure to question whether it is worth more than doubling their original \u00a3300m 10-year deal - which expires in June 2015 - when the deposed champions are going through this difficult period of transition.\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to see Chelsea players star in new Adidas kit advert\n\nNew deal: Adidas could clinch a world record \u00a360m-a-year kit deal with Manchester United\n\nLong-term: Nike have been United's kit supplier since the 2002-03 season\n\nMeetings: United officials met adidas executives in Germany after the game with Bayern Munich - CEO Ed Woodward (centre) and Managing Director Richard Arnold (second from left) know they have to get a deal signed quickly because of demand\n\nUnited officials met adidas executives in Germany after their recent Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich and senior figures from the sportswear brand have been attending recent matches at Old Trafford.\n\nNegotiations with Nike have been going on for the last three years, but when their exclusive negotiating period expired last autumn that opened the door for companies like adidas and Warrior.\n\nIt is adidas who are now prepared to sign off the biggest football club kit deal in history in the belief that United's global appeal remains undamaged by a disastrous domestic season that culminated in the dismissal of manager David Moyes.\n\nImminent: Louis van Gaal is expected to be announced as Manchester United boss this week\n\nDeal: Chelsea have a 10-year \u00a3300m sponsorship deal with adidas\n\nEd Woodward, the United executive vice chairman, has been busy recruiting a replacement, with Louis van Gaal's appointment thought to be imminent.\n\nBut Woodward and the club's commercial director Richard Arnold know they need to sign off the next kit deal as soon as possible too, simply because the sheer demand for United merchandise means production needs to begin sooner rather than later.\n\nA deal with adidas would still give United the freedom to create a separate fashion brand, with Japanese company Uniqlo thought to be close to completing their own deal.", "AS IT HAPPENED: Relive all the action with Sportsmail's minute-by-minute coverage of the World Cup clash\n\nIt was not a testing finish by any stretch but as Kylian Mbappe tapped in the goal which booked to France into the next round, he created his own little piece of World Cup history.\n\nMbappe, not born when the French claimed this trophy in 1998, became the first teenager to score for his country at a World Cup finals and their youngest goalscorer in any major tournament.\n\n'It was my dream, it has come true and I hope I will have more,' smiled the 19-year-old.\n\nKylian Mbappe scored the decisive goal to send France to the top of Group C as he converted easily from close range\n\nThe Paris Saint-Germain star pulled off his trademark arms crossed celebration and was joined swiftly by Antoine Griezmann\n\nMbappe struggled to assert his influence in France's tournament opener against Australia but was effective against Peru\n\nDidier Deschamps' side have failed to live up to expectation but victory over Peru means they have taken maximum points\n\nDefeat for the South American side means they are out of the tournament after defeats to France and Denmark\n\nMATCH FACTS AND PLAYER RATINGS\n\nFrance (4-3-3): Lloris 6.5;

'He showed his speed and did what he had to do in the team plan. I am very satisfied.'\n\nMbappe, not be 20 until December, is comfortably set in football's fast lane.\n\nAt least he was until his dreadfully slow exit in the 75th minute, shaking hands with virtually every player on the pitch as he made his way off.\n\nFrance were under pressure and being tested in defence by this point.\n\nPeru were dominating the ball and gathering momentum but an equaliser never came and their first appearance at a World Cup since 1982 will progress no further than the group.\n\nThey will leave an impression in Russia with their remarkable support but they will head for home next week having lost their opening two games without managing to score a goal.\n\nVAR AND A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY FOR PERU\n\nWith nine minutes left on the clock, referee Mohammed Mohammed Abdulla brandished a yellow card in the face of Edison Flores.\n\nBut as Flores shook his head in disbelief, it emerged that the midfielder had not actually committed a foul and instead his team-mate Pedro Aquino Sanchez had actually been the guilty party.\n\nCommentators insisted the Video Assistant Referees (VAR) were able to assess the situation on the grounds of mistaken identity and Abdulla was informed of his error.\n\nHe gestured to Flores that he had, in fact, not been booked while Aquino was rightly cautioned.\n\nEdinson Flores was perplexed after he was shown a yellow card by referee Mohammed Mohammed Abdulla for a foul he never made\n\nBut with the help of the Video Assistant Referee, Abdulla was able to fix his mistake on grounds of mistaken identity for the booking\n\nThe second game of Group C took place at the uniquely constructed Ekaterinburg Arena where fans flooded the outer stand\n\nDeschamps gave little away in his facial expressions in Ekaterinburg and knows his side will face far sterner tests later on\n\nFrance made two changes from the opening win over Australia with Olivier Giroud and Blaise Matuidi brought in to start\n\nChelsea striker Giroud provided the French with a focal point up top which gave them an outlet for team-mates to play freely\n\nGiroud's introduction from the start allowed Griezmann, stifled against Australia, to express himself from wider positions\n\n'We are pained to be eliminated but we gave it our all,' said manager Ricardo Gareca.

'It helps if you have won World Cups and European Championships doesn't it?' he replied 'And you can't always predict when the end is coming.'\n\nHow prescient those words have proven to be. Dropped by club and country in the space of 18 days last year, with Jose Mourinho too sour even to extend public congratulations on him becoming Manchester United's all-time top scorer, it transpires that even the Goodison Park refuge Rooney sought last summer was an illusion.\n\nSo much for the social media #welcomehomeWayne messages and that imaginative 60-second Everton film that went viral, capturing his walk through the corridors of the club, to the soundtrack of some of his most famous Everton moments.\n\nThe Everton striker is set to be offloaded by the club and is weighing up a move to USA or China\n\nSo he finds himself back where this wretched last 18 months began, weighing up a move away, most likely to the United States and DC United. To which any who have been captivated by his genius, his toil and his fundamental humanity will surely say: 'Don't do this, Wayne. It's time to hang up your boots and call it a day. Just let go now.'\n\nSomehow, the discussion always gravitates back to his 'refuelling habits' (to cite Graham Taylor's description of Paul Gascoigne's extra-curricular activities), to a sense of unfulfilled promise and the two fat contracts in seven years that Rooney wrung out of United.\n\nBut it is his profound misfortune that this decline has coincided with a new age of football longevity. Cristiano Ronaldo, eight months older than him, electrifies. Franck Ribery, 35, signs a 12-month contract extension at Bayern Munich. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 36, is an instant hit for LA Galaxy.\n\nHe has found himself surplus to Everton's requirement and sat out of the Southampton match\n\nSHOW US YOUR MEDALS\n\nTROPHIES (all with Manchester United)\n\nPremier League: 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13,\n\nFA Cup: 2016\n\nLeague Cup: 2006, 2010, 2017\n\nChampions League: 2008\n\nEuropa League: 2017\n\nClub World Cup: 2008\n\nCommunity Shield: 2007, 2010, 2011, 2016\n\nRECORDS\n\nManchester United's record scorer: 253 goals in 559 games\n\nEngland's record scorer: 53 goals in 119 games\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that Rooney is not built like any of them. Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager who has known him better than any, often alluded to his metabolism, observing in an interview marking his eclipse of Sir Bobby Charlton's goal record last year that Rooney and Ryan Giggs were simply made differently.\n\n'Wayne's got a different physique,' said Ferguson. 'He's stocky; well made. Players age in different ways.'\n\nThat would be relevant to any notion of Rooney disappearing off to play in Asia because behind the riches of China lurk the prospect of him being asked to throw himself around a football field in that country's oppressive and deeply uncomfortable climate.\n\nHe and China have simply never seemed to fit and not only because of the sweat box it can be. Rooney no more possesses a wanderlust than Steven Gerrard ever did.\n\nThe MLS will certainly welcome Rooney with open arms. But the league, with its long-haul away games and range of climates, offers no home comforts for Rooney. It won't be a stroll in the park.\n\nThe life Gerrard described in Los Angeles, having left his wife and daughters behind on Merseyside to join the Galaxy, sounded nothing less than lonely at times.\n\nRooney (right) poses with the Premier League trophy with Paul Scholes (left) and Nani (centre)\n\nNeither does the notion of uprooting four young sons sound alluring, though the events in Alderley Edge which landed Rooney in Stockport Magistrates Court last winter demonstrated that the consequences can be incendiary when the sobering influence of Mrs Rooney is not at hand.\n\nIt's all so different for the 35-plus brigade, whose battery of fitness solutions has given them alternatives. Ibrahimovic has long-serving physio Dario Fort, who has worked with him in Milan, Paris and Manchester. Ronaldo has his cryotherapy chamber and swimming pools. Gareth Barry, 37, has followed Giggs into yoga.\n\nBut these solutions don't work for everyone. 'If a player is weak at the end of the muscular range they are stretching and holding, it can worsen injuries. It doesn't suit everybody,' says Rob Swire, physio- therapist at Manchester United for 23 years until 2014.\n\nThe prolific striker won five Premier League trophies, one FA Cup and three League Cups\n\nSwire, who is unable to discuss individual United players, says that the 'wear and tear and number of games' inflicted on a player thrown early into first-team football is a more significant factor than yoga when it comes to assessing how long a career will last. Rooney has played 491 Premier League games since the age of 16.\n\nHe is not without alternatives now. His brief TV appearances this season have demonstrated his appeal, while his managers these last few years consistently describe an intelligence which makes coaching a more realistic option than it once seemed. Both are infinitely better routes than the twilight journey Gascoigne embarked upon, having taken his own talents to Everton in 2000.\n\nThe plan, Gascoigne reflected years later, was to 'end my career there at the top, aged 35, still playing in the Premier League'.\n\nYet he instead found himself surplus to Everton's requirement, washing around the second tier on \u00a35,000 a week at Burnley, on the promise of a share of gate receipts if the team went up. And then, having rejected a derisory offer from DC United, heading out to China to play for Gansu Tianma.\n\n'The Sars virus had started, all their football games were off,' Gascoigne related. 'So I came home and never went back. They still owe me money.'\n\nThe symmetries make this a salutary tale for Rooney. Both are individuals who touched the heights, lit up the game. Both are entitled to be remembered for better.", "Shock and, indeed, horror. The Premier League fix the fixtures. Well, not fix, exactly. Plan, that would be the better word. Arrange, maybe.\n\nThey keep the top six teams apart on the opening and final weekends of the season. And we are meant to be outraged by this.\n\nFor most, the reaction will be little more than a shrug. Tell us something we didn't know. Anyone who still believes in the famous computer, spewing out its pairings at random, is probably still committed to Father Christmas, the Easter Bunny and the inevitability of Jeremy Corbyn as the next Prime Minister.\n\nPremier League ties are managed so the top six are kept apart on opening and final weekends\n\nAll those Super Sundays, clashing derby days in north and south, prime-timed collisions to overshadow international breaks or rival major events in other sports do not happen by accident. We're not stupid. Wow, Manchester United versus Liverpool and Arsenal against Chelsea on the same weekend -- again. Well, what are the chances of that happening?\n\nThe thing is, what the Premier League cooks up doesn't harm its competition in the least. The season does not need contrived marquee openings or showy grand finales. Most weeks, excitement just happens.\n\nNot this Sunday, admittedly. The final Champions League slot requires no more than Liverpool to draw at home to Brighton, while a 10-goal swing is needed to adjust the relegation placings. So it's a bit anticlimactic.\n\nBut still not as much as it would have been if, say, the Manchester derby had been saved until last with City a yawning gap clear. Only a showdown between Chelsea and Liverpool could make the battle at the top interesting -- and that happened as recently as last week anyway. So major clubs do meet in the final weeks of the season. It just occurs by chance, with cup commitments causing rearrangements, rather than by special command.\n\nOver the last three seasons, the final four fixtures of the campaign have brought games between Chelsea and Tottenham, Manchester City and Arsenal, and Liverpool and Chelsea (2016), Tottenham and Manchester United (2017) and Manchester United and Arsenal and Chelsea and Liverpool (2018). Not forgetting that in 2016 Leicester were actually the best team in the country, with a fixture list that included Manchester United and Chelsea away in their final three fixtures.\n\nMeaning stuff happens, as it will over a programme of 380 matches. Inadvertently, the fixtures throw up little cup finals all the time. Who would have imagined that Swansea v Southampton would turn into one of the most crucial matches of the season, or that a routine meeting between Chelsea and Huddersfield at Stamford Bridge would produce such extremes of emotion?\n\nNot everything has to be names, names, names. Not all seasons must come to a last-day crescendo.\n\nBig fixtures are still served up late in the campaign, as seen with Chelsea and Liverpool\n\nArsenal's game at Anfield in 1989 remains a high point -- Michael Thomas scoring late to snatch the title from Liverpool -- but that was a result of tragedy, not clever preparation. The game was supposed to take place on April 23, but was postponed following the Hillsborough disaster eight days earlier. So it wasn't a scheduled finale. Indeed it was the first time since 1952 that two teams faced each other on the final day to decide the title.\n\nThe narrative of a season cannot be choreographed that precisely.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter. If a head-to-head meeting is the pinnacle, variations are no less compelling these days through modern technology.\n\nWhen Sergio Aguero decided the title with almost the last kick in 2012 it didn't matter that the team Manchester City beat -- Manchester United -- were not on the pitch. City were at home to QPR, United at Sunderland. The drama as broadcasters cut between the venues, jubilation turning to distress, despair to elation, was what made those final moments so compelling.\n\nThis is not 1952. If the title is being decided, the cameras will be there and it will feel like the teams are in the same arena even if they are separated by 200 miles. Just as it will on Sunday if Liverpool are losing at home and Chelsea winning at St James' Park. That there are two other teams who can influence the outcome -- Brighton and Newcastle -- only adds to the tension.\n\nAs every league, in every sport, eyes foreign markets, there is talk of changing formats. The Premier League started it by entertaining a 39th game, but La Liga are hastening in that direction too. Media marketing companies are interested in taking Spanish games to China but there is a problem.\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid are considered a more saleable commodity than La Liga in Asia, in a way Manchester United and Liverpool, for instance, are not.\n\n'English football is more competitive and there are different clubs for Chinese fans,' said Yuan Bi of Titan Sports in Beijing, 'but there are only two in Spain. If you want Chinese fans to watch more games, there have to be more than two Clasicos every season.'\n\nBut, domestically, who would favour that? A never-ending collision of the biggest names, so that the fixture is watered down, much like Rangers and Celtic. The Old Firm met five times this season, six times in 2016-17. The arrival of Steven Gerrard may command attention but, increasingly, the game has lost its meaning.\n\nIn their title winning season Leicester still had to play Manchester United and Chelsea late on\n\nAs Barcelona and Real Madrid would, if it was played six times a year; as Manchester United and Liverpool would were it manipulated to be the closer to every season. Here comes another one, just like the other one. Who cares?\n\nTo keep the biggest games back would risk making them redundant, too. Manchester City won the league from five games out this season. Manchester United have also done that in the Premier League era. So what if their run down the home straight had included meetings with Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal? Dead rubbers all.\n\nGlenn Hoddle felt that his predecessor as England manager, Terry Venables, stitched him up in the fixture planning meeting for the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. England were scheduled to go to Italy in the last game. Hoddle thought that Venables had left him facing a daunting cup final.\n\nVenables saw it differently. If England did their job, he reasoned, they could be through and their toughest fixture would be meaningless. If the group was still live, then at least England would know what they had to do, and it wouldn't matter, home or away. He was right.\n\nDespite losing to Italy at Wembley, England went to Rome knowing they needed a point to qualify -- and got a 0-0 draw. Had they won at home, the away fixture would have been irrelevant.\n\nThe detail of the way the Premier League programme is arranged came out in the tender document for broadcast rights for seasons 2019-20 to 2021-22. It promises rights holders that there will be at least one match between 'top six' clubs -- a calculation now taken over three seasons, to avoid anomalies like Chelsea's 10th-place finish -- across 26 weekend fixture programmes, but this will always exclude opening weekend and the final round of games. Understandably so.\n\nLa Liga are trying to broaden their appeal, but would have to play El Clasico more frequently\n\nThe Premier League does not need to capture the imagination of the public in its first week -- a summer of new signings and managerial changes, plus the enduring optimism of fans, will do that.\n\nEqually, when the 38th game comes around, the destination of the title, relegation issues, and European qualification has the potential to make even the most mundane encounter captivating.\n\nIt is in the midst of winter, when reality has dawned, a predictable pattern is emerging and there is disillusionment with a competition that often divides from richest to poorest, that the Premier League needs to keep the fire alive.\n\nSome think this is the best in the world. It isn't. But it is the most successful. And to be that it has to be the best run, the best planned, have the strongest vision, know exactly what it is, and what it must deliver. And each season it does that beautifully. What did we think? That this was all the work of a random fixture generator?\n\nIf the Premier League has a smart computer, it has smarter people operating it. That's why the other leagues scramble just to keep up.\n\nShame that Wayne was not the blue messiah\n\nIt is a great pity that the move to Everton does not appear to have worked out for Wayne Rooney.\n\nIt would have been wonderful if he could have sparked a revival on the blue half of Merseyside. He did score arguably the goal of the season while there, though -- from long range against West Ham -- and his hat-trick in that game is the moment Everton turned the corner.\n\nSo it wasn't all bad. If he wants to be a manager maybe one day he'll be back. He never talked like he was doing Everton a favour, either; unlike some.\n\nIt is a great pity that Wayne Rooney's Everton return does not appear to have worked out\n\nSanches a symbol of failure\n\nRenato Sanches has gone from not being good enough for Bayern Munich, to not being good enough for Swansea. He cannot get into a team that is almost certain to be relegated on Sunday. Undaunted, he has released his own emoji.\n\nSwansea fans are understandably upset at the timing -- Sanches thinking only of self-promotion as his team drop like a stone.\n\nAn equally central issue is, who would want it? Who recognises Sanches after this dismal season? He's hardly a household name, hardly high profile.\n\nAnd what would his emoji symbolise? Unfulfilled promise? A career going down the tubes? An upcoming visit to Wigan, perhaps?\n\nRenato Sanches can't even get into Swansea's team, but is bringing out his own emoji soon\n\nIf the hundred turns into a booze-up, ECB will be in a tonne of bother\n\nThe violence at Goodwood last Saturday was timely. Cricket now knows what it has to look forward to.\n\nA brawl involving up to 50 racegoers marred a sunny bank holiday meeting, exchanges of chanting between groups in the bar exploding in brutality captured in sickening, graphic footage. One prone figure is seen being kicked in the head as he lays on the floor, and police report four were taken to hospital.\n\n'Events like this remain very rare in our sport,' said Racecourse Association chief executive Stephen Atkin. But they don't. There were scenes at the Guineas meeting in Newmarket a few years ago that resembled the Wild West. And if actual fights do not break out, the conditions that lead to them -- extreme drunkenness, aggression, over-crowding -- are commonplace.\n\nWhy? Because racing has pursued a non-racing crowd, the same way cricket is increasingly dismissive of cricket-lovers. Boozers. That's what they want. All-day, or all-night drinkers, who will boost revenue at the bar and are more interested in an expensive trip to the champagne tent than a look at the paddock.\n\nViolence broke out at Goodwood last Saturday as racegoers became embroiled in fighting\n\nEvery major race meeting these days produces scenes of drunken debauchery and as the British cannot handle their drink, or hot weather, a 50-man fight on the Sussex Downs is always a possibility.\n\nThe Hundred, the ECB's latest attempt to sell the game to anyone but those who love it most, is supposed to appeal to families and new customers. Yet the same was said of Twenty20 and now look at it. The louts have taken over.\n\nMany Friday night Twenty20 matches are beery, yobbish affairs, the last place anyone would want to take youngsters keen on cricket. It's a giant pub beer garden with a cricket match faintly attached; lairy, boorish, the sport incidental to the more dedicated pursuit of bleary oblivion.\n\nWhy would The Hundred be greatly different? It's aimed at the same audience. People who don't like cricket. People who wouldn't dream of engaging with the nuances of a Test game, or even marvelling at the skill in a well-played Twenty20 innings. They'll raucously cheer a six but, really, if it's a choice between the sport and the bar there is only one winner.\n\nThe utter confusion as cricket thrashes around in search of a new audience could be felt in the fallout from the ECB's meeting with the Professional Cricketers' Association. Daryl Mitchell, the PCA chairman, emerged with startling news about The Hundred.\n\n'Test players won't be taking part,' he said. 'The likes of Joe Root and Ben Stokes will be allocated to a team for marketing purposes, but they won't play. The point was made that the new audience won't necessarily know who Stokes and Root are anyway.'\n\nCricket is falling into the same trap as racing and attracting a different kind of audience\n\nThink about that one for a minute because it's quite possible nobody at the ECB has. Cricket is attempting to attract a fan so ignorant of its virtues, he doesn't know England's captain or its best player. Yet the ECB is so stupid it plans to attach these two unknown figures to teams -- not to play and attract interest with their skills, but for 'marketing purposes'.\n\nAnd what exactly are they going to market if no one knows who they are? They might as well get someone in from Geordie Shore. In fact, why stop there? Let the mug from Geordie Shore open the batting. It would make as much sense as wasting the time of England's captain, having him promote a competition few care about to a roomful of people who don't know who he is.\n\nStill, racing thinks it has been very successful, if we can ignore the sirens, in locating its new audience. Maybe cricket will find one, too. The undercard starts at 7pm.\n\nFernandes is well off the mark at Rangers\n\nWhen Tony Fernandes completed his takeover of Queens Park Rangers on August 18, 2011, they were a Premier League club, albeit one who had just lost 4-0 at home to Bolton.\n\nComing up seven years and approaching seven managers later, Rangers finished 16th in the Championship.\n\nAsked how he would grade his work at the club so far, Fernandes awarded himself a C-plus. There will be many GCSE, A-level and graduate students at this time of the year hoping for such a generous marking system.", "Manchester United boss, Jose Mourinho has revealed players he will use as

deserved to be on the All-Star team but didn't make the cut\n\nThe MLS All-Star Game has become a signature event for Major League Soccer, but over the years it has become a bit less about showcasing the players who are actually performing the best at the time of the game.\n\nTraditionally, All-Star Games feature the players who have earned their way into the game because of performance rather than reputation. The recent MLB All-Star Game was a good showcase of that, as it often is.\n\nUnlike baseball's summer showcase, the MLS event is a bit less a talent showcase and more of a party where the hosts don't mind playing favorites, and big names earn invites even when they may not be performing up to par.\n\nRelated A night to remember: D.C.

Unlike the NFL, NBA or MLB, which put together competing teams made up of players from opposing conferences or leagues. MLS used to have that format, but changed it in 2005 to consist of a team of MLS stars against whichever foreign club could be secured as an opponent. In the dozen years since, we have seen the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid take part, and this year the game will feature Italian giant Juventus.\n\nAn argument could be made that the league has outgrown that format with the number of teams having doubled and the league boasting growing number of stars that could be chosen for such a match. The record-setting fan base in Atlanta would still fill Mercedes-Benz Stadium if the match was East versus West, and there would be plenty of star power for both sides to make it a memorable contest.\n\nSetting aside the format aspect of the MLS All-Star Game discussion, the process to select players to play in the current format leaves plenty to be desired. Fans are allowed to vote on the first 11, a group of players that automatically make the all-star team, but don't necessarily start in the match. Atlanta's sizable fanbase did its part to stuff the ballot box, and succeeded in securing places for six Atlanta United players in the Fan XI (one of which -- Darlington Nagbe -- wound up having to miss out due to injury).\n\nThe rest of the squad is chosen by the coach of the team from the host market, which happens to be Atlanta United's Gerardo Martino (MLS commissioner Don Garber also gets to select two players, which are usually big star players or top young talents). MLS All-Star coaches have free rein to select any group of players they wish, and in the past we have seen coaches make choices based on personal preference and tactical necessity much more so than based on actual performance during the season in question. The idea is generally to try and build a group that can function well as a team, but some coaches have taken that premise a bit too far.\n\nMartino's selections weren't the worst we have ever seen, but he had a few choices that probably wouldn't have made the cut if voting were made by a consensus of coaches. As a result, some very deserving candidates have been left off the list (at least for now, there are still two weekends worth of matches to be played before the MLS All-Star Game on August 1).\n\nHere are the five players who Goal sees being the biggest snubs from the MLS All-Star Game:\n\nMAXI MORALEZ, NYCFCThe New York City FC playmaker has been one of the very best players in the league through the first half of the season, compiling seven goals an 10 assists for an NYCFC squad one point out of first place in the Supporter's Shield race. He is one assist off the MLS lead, and has scored twice as many goals as any other player with double-digit assists.\n\nUnfortunately for Moralez, all-star voters put both Miguel Almiron and Ezequiel Barco on the squad, and when Martino selected Valeri, it left no room for another playmaker. You have to think that Moralez would be the first player called upon if any of the aforementioned players (or commissioner's pick Sebastian Giovinco) is unable to play.\n\nKEMAR LAWRENCE, New York Red Bulls\n\nThe lack of fullback selections, and total absence of natural left backs, makes it seem likely that Martino will deploy a three-man defense against Juventus, which makes sense given the strengths of the MLS talent pool. That said, it's a harsh exclusion for Lawrence, who has been the best left back in the league this year. The Jamaican speedster has not only maintained his stingy one-on-one defending, but he has also become more of an attacking threat for the Red Bulls.\n\nTo be fair to Martino, he did select two other Red Bulls defenders in Aaron Long and Michael Murillo, but the Red Bulls boast the best defense in the league and Lawrence has been a big reason for that.\n\nSEBASTIAN BLANCO, Portland Timbers\n\nThe Portland Timbers are riding a league-best 11-match unbeaten streak and a big reason for their success has been the improved play of Blanco, who you can argue has outperformed teammate and reigning MLS MVP Valeri this season. Blanco has compiled five goals and six assists, numbers which don't do justice to the constant threat he has provided for the Timbers attack. He has helped prevent teams from keying in on Valeri, and has also improved his defensive contributions.\n\nUnfortunately for Blanco, he was unlikely to be included along with Valeri, but there are few midfielders in the league who have been more effective than he has been so far this season.\n\nMATT TURNER, New England Revolution\n\nReputation always plays a part in all-star selections, so being a breakout player in the middle of his first season as a pro starter probably isn't a good place to be in order to draw all-star game consideration. That being said, Turner has been outstanding for New England, and is currently looking like the front runner for MLS Goalkeeper of the Year honors. The 24-year-old should have ample time to play himself onto future all-star teams though, so don't feel too bad for him.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBrad Guzan was the fan's choice, and you can't really blame anybody for that pick even if he did benefit from Atlanta ballot-stuffing. Credit should go to Martino for selecting Zack Steffen, who is the same goalkeeper who helped eliminate Atlanta United from the playoffs a year ago.\n\nROLAND LAMAH, FC Dallas\n\nFC Dallas is tied for the best points-per-game average and sits in first place in the West, yet managed just one player -- Matt Hedges -- on the all-star team. That's way too light. Martino should have found room for Lamah, who provides speed and versatility in the attack and who has been instrumental in FCD's impressive first half.\n\nOther players who can be called all-star snubs include Diego Chara, Christian Penilla, Darwin Quintero, Reggie Cannon and Tyler Adams.", "Relive all the action from a dramatic night of Euro 2016 qualifying matches.\n\nScotland twice equalised at home to World Cup winners Germany but Ilkay Gundogan's fine strike earned Joachim Low's side all three points at Hampden Park.\n\nElsewhere, Jonathan Walters' goal was enough for the Republic of Ireland to beat Georgia and Kyle Lafferty grabbed a point for Northern Ireland with a late equaliser against Hungary.\n\nMATCH REPORT: SCOTLAND 2-3 GERMANY\n\nMATCH REPORT: REPUBLIC OF IRELAND 1-0 GEORGIA\n\nMATCH REPORT: NORTHERN IRELAND 1-1 HUNGARY\n\nRory Keane\n\nHost commentator\n\nJoe Strange\n\nHost commentator\n\nAuto-update 21:43 That's all for tonight, folks\n\nThanks for joining me for Sportsmail's live coverage of tonight's Euro 2016 qualifiers.\n\nI'll be back tomorrow with England vs Switzerland at Wembley, plus updates from the other fixtures being played around Europe.\n\n21:38 Full-time scores around Europe\n\nScotland 2-3 Germany\n\nRepublic of Ireland 1-0 Georgia\n\nNorthern Ireland 1-1 Hungary - Northern Ireland secure a play-off spot at least\n\nPoland 8-1 Gibraltar\n\nFinland 1-0 Faroe Islands\n\nRomania 0-0 Greece\n\nArmenia 0-0 Denmark\n\nAlbania 0-1 Portugal\n\n21:35 90+3 mins - GOAL! Northern Ireland 1-1 Hungary (Lafferty)\n\nLate drama at Windsor Park and it's that man Kyle Lafferty. The Norwich man was on hand to poke home a rebound from just a yard out, sparking wild scenes in the stands.\n\n21:34 Two added minutes at Hampden Park 21:32 89 mins - Not long to go in Ireland\n\nThe Republic need to hold onto their one-goal lead against Georgia for just a few more minutes, while Northern Ireland are desperately chasing an equaliser with 10 men at home to Hungary. Michael O'Neill's men have five added minutes to do just that, while Martin O'Neill's side have just 90 seconds remaining.\n\n21:29 85 mins - Gotze goes off\n\nAnd is replaced by Andre Schurrle.\n\n21:28 84 mins - Marshall keeps Scotland's hopes alive\n\nAnother slick Germany move ends with Gundogan smashing a shot straight down the throat of Marshall. He palmed it away well and the Scots are still just a goal down as the clock ticks down. A little over five minutes of normal time remaining.\n\n21:27 Hungary's Richard Guzmics wheels away after scoring against Northern Ireland 21:25 81 mins - Baird sent off!\n\nChris Baird is shown two yellow cards in quick succession and he's off! He argued his case for a good minute but Northern Ireland are down to 10 men for the final 10 minutes.\n\n21:22 78 mins - Hutton wins a free-kick...\n\n...after a challenge from Kroos. Looks like Mulgrew is going for goal from 30 yards...\n\nNo is the answer. His effort hits the wall and Germany break quickly again.\n\n21:20 Jon Walters is left on the turf after poking home his country's opening goal 21:16 74 mins - GOAL! Northern Ireland 0-1 Hungary (Guzmics)\n\nHungary whip in a free-kick from out on the right, Michael McGovern should have a simple catch but he flaps at it and Guzmics is able to poke the ball home from just a couple of yards. Awful error by the keeper and it doesn't look like Northern Ireland will be qualifying tonight.\n\n21:12 69 mins - GOAL! Republic of Ireland 1-0 Georgia (Walters)\n\nTold you the Republic were looking more lively! Hendrick produces a moment of magic out on the left, bursts into the box and delivers a perfect low cross for Jon Walters to tap home from just a couple of yards out. Huge goal for the hosts.\n\n21:10 66 mins - McCarthy hasn't got his shooting boots on\n\nTwo opportunities to test Georgia's goalkeeper in the last few minutes for James McCarthy but he fails with both, first firing over before dragging his second effort horribly wide. Martin O'Neill's men starting to look more lively in attack now, though.\n\nJames McCarthy challenges Georgia mifielder Tornike Okriashvili at the Aviva Stadium 21:07 62 mins - Schweinsteiger tests Marshall\n\nAnother quick move from Germany but this time it doesn't end in a goal. Manchester United new boy Schweinsteiger drives a powerful shot at goal from outside the box but Marshall beat it away and Scotland survive.\n\n21:05 60 mins - First change for Scotland\n\nIkechi Anya replaces Maloney with half an hour left to play.\n\n21:04 Ilkay Gundogan sweeps the ball into the back of the net via the post to make it 3-2 21:02 58 mins - Scotland becoming frustrated\n\nMaloney gets booked for a mistimed challenge moments after James Morrison had his name added to the referee's notebook. The first cautions of the evening.\n\n21:00 Northern Ireland's Stuart Dallas has a shot saved by Gabor Kiraly 20:57 54 mins - GOAL! Scotland 2-3 Germany (Gundogan)\n\nBrilliant football from the world champions. Gundogan slips a ball down the right for Muller to run on to, he collects it and picks out the run of the Borussia Dortmund man, leaving him unmarked and able to sweep the ball in off the post. Can Scotland respond again?\n\n20:54 48 mins - Germany continuing where they left off\n\nJoachim Low's men enjoyed 78 per cent of possession in the opening period and it's been a similar story early on in the second. Ozil is dispossessed inside Scotland's area before seeing a headed cross cut out. The hosts are continuing to defend as a unit.\n\n20:50 47 mins - Coleman has a go\n\nPositive play from Seamus Coleman early in the second half. The Everton man drove down the right, cut back onto his left foot but then bent a curling shot wide.\n\n20:48 Northern Ireland and the Republic are back underway\n\nAnd just like the first-half, Scotland are a couple of minutes behind.\n\n20:46 Half-time change for the Republic of Ireland\n\nShane Long replaces Robbie Keane. Is he the man to get them a goal?\n\nCRAIG HOPE: Martin O'Neill reacts to awful first half by hooking captain Robbie Keane - Shane Long is on.\n\n20:45 Half-time scores from around Europe\n\nPoland 3-0 Gibraltar\n\nFinland 0-0 Faroe Islands\n\nRomania 0-0 Greece\n\nAlbania 0-0 Portugal\n\nFT: Armenia 0-0 Denmark\n\n20:38 Scotland's James McArthur makes it 2-2 with a long-range strike 20:36 Sportsmail's Craig Hope isn't impressed by what he's seen in Dublin\n\nWell, that was an uninspiring 45 minutes from Ireland (again)...\n\n20:34 Thomas Muller stoops to head Germany into a 2-1 lead at Hampden Park 20:33 Half-time around Europe\n\nScotland 2-2 Germany\n\nNorthern Ireland 0-0 Hungary\n\nRepublic of Ireland 0-0 Georgia\n\n20:30 43 mins - GOAL! Scotland 2-2 Germany (McArthur)\n\nScotland are back in it! A cross from the left is cleared but only to James McArthur, who controls a half-volley with his instep straight into the back of the net from almost 25 yards. Brilliant goal but Neuer will feel he should have dealt with it better.\n\n20:29 42 mins - Brunt must do better\n\nChris Brunt gets another chance to deliver a free-kick into the box from the right but his effort is poor and Hungary clear the danger with ease. The West Brom man is so much better than that.\n\n20:27 39 mins - Gotze scores...\n\n...but it's disallowed for offside. Lovely touch and finish from the Bayern Munich man, mind.\n\n20:26 39 mins - Georgia continuing to frustrate the Republic\n\nWe're almost 40 minutes into the game at the Aviva and Georgia have actually enjoyed more possession - 52 per cent - than the hosts. Surely Robbie Keane and Co won't fail to win and strengthen their drip on a play-off spot?\n\n20:21 34 mins - GOAL! Scotland 1-2 Germany (Muller)\n\nWell that didn't last long. Marshall saves a low drive from Can but instead of diverting the ball wide he palms it straight onto the head of Muller who makes no mistake from six yards. Scotland had the lead for just six minutes.\n\n20:20 Mats Hummels watches the ball bounce off his chest to make it 1-1 20:19 Sportsmail's Craig Hope reports from the Aviva Stadium\n\nOn the evidence of the first 25 minutes O'Neill has got his selection wrong here. Three central midfielders is a waste - he should have started with wingers. I suspect we'll see a change at half-time if remains goalless.\n\n20:15 28 mins - GOAL! Scotland 1-1 Germany (Hummels OG)\n\nShaun Maloney whips in the resulting free-kick, Manuel Neuer palms it straight back into the danger zone and the ball bounces off the chest of Mats Hummels and into the back of the net. Hampden is rocking - 1-1!\n\n20:15 27 mins - Could Scotland have had a penalty?\n\nCharlie Mulgrew wins a free-kick right on the edge of Germany's area after being held back by Emre Can. Looked like it might have been on the line...\n\n20:12 24 mins - Martin O'Neill's men not having it all their own way\n\nGeorgia aren't just sitting back at the Aviva Stadium. An overhead kick from the visitors flew just wide of Shay Given's left-hand post a moment ago and we're still level at 0-0.\n\n20:10 Thomas Muller is congratulated by his team-mates after opening the scoring 20:05 18 mins - GOAL! Scotland 0-1 Germany (Muller)\n\nHuge blow for Scotland. Thomas Muller escapes a couple of challenges and gets a left-footed shot in at goal from just outside the box. It looks comfortable for Marshall until a huge deflection from Russell Martin takes it into the opposite corner. Germany lead 1-0.\n\n20:04 Northern Ireland's Chris Brunt tussles with Hungary's Akos Elek 20:03 Georgia refusing to roll over against the Republic, writes Craig Hope\n\nMartin O'Neill talked of Empoli striker Levan Mchedlidze being Georgia's dangerman and twice he's got in behind Ireland's backline already. His first effort was blocked by a sliding Ciaran Clark and his second was scuffed into the arms of a relieved Shay Given - this might not be as easy as the hosts had hoped.\n\n20:02 15 mins - Northern Ireland pushing forward\n\nA well-worked free-kick from the hosts almost finds a man in space but Hungary defend it superbly and end up winning a goal-kick. Michael O'Neill's men look determined to seal qualification tonight.\n\n19:58 Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger picks up the ball at Hampden Park 19:56 8 mins - Germany try their luck... twice\n\nFirst Mesut Ozil has a shot from 25 yards blocked, then Toni Kroos' low drive flies well wide of Marshall's left-hand post. A warning for Scotland.\n\n19:54 6 mins - Hutton driving forward\n\nThe atmosphere at Hampden Park sounds brilliant. There's a huge roar as Alan Hutton bursts down the right and wins a throw-in in a promising area. It comes to nothing but the hosts are holding their own against the World Cup holders so far.\n\n19:51 4 mins - The Republic under some early pressure\n\nGeorgia win a corner inside the opening three minutes but the hosts clear the danger with relative ease. Northern Ireland also come under pressure early, with Hungary's captain firing a low shot just wide.\n\n19:49 A reminder than Northern Ireland can qualify TONIGHT\n\nFor a full rundown of who can make it to Euro 2016 and when, CLICK HERE.\n\n19:46 And we're off!\n\nBut only in Northern Ireland and the Republic.

The fans certainly believe they will. Five minutes to go.\n\n19:43 Thanks to Rory for getting us started...\n\nI'm taking over just in time for kick-off. National anthems are being belted out across Scotland, the Republic or Ireland and Northern Ireland and we're almost ready to go.\n\n19:37 Big night for Martin O'Neill's side in Dublin, Sportsmail's Craig Hope has an update\n\nIt's a year to the day since Ireland beat opposition other than Gibraltar in a competitive game. That was the campaign opener in Georgia. Since then they've drawn at home to Poland and Scotland, matches in which they failed to deliver in front of bumper crowds here at the Aviva.\n\nIt looks as if there'll only be around 30,000 here tonight but the need to win is greater than any other during Martin O'Neill's reign.\n\nCan they do it? I have been far from impressed with Ireland in qualifying - they lack imagination and energy in the final third - but Georgia have won only one of their last 22 away games, and that was against Gibraltar.\n\nIf Ireland cannot win tonight then they simply do not deserve to qualify for France next summer.\n\n19:36 Scotland skipper Scott Brown (right) will be integral to his side's chances this evening 19:35 Chris Wheeler has an early update from Windsor Park\n\nThere's a real sense of anticipation at Windsor Park ahead of kick-off, and everyone knows what Northern Ireland have to do here. They could have sold-out this game several times over but capacity will once again be limited to 10,000 as building work continues around the stadium. Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley are being presented with their 50 caps on the pitch. Hopefully they will have their hands on an even better prize later tonight.\n\n19:19 Germany fans have descended on Hampden Park for tonight's clash with the Scots 19:16 Germany, Hungary and Georgia have announced their starting line-ups\n\nGermany XI: Neuer, Can, Boateng, Hummels, Hector, Schweinsteiger, Kroos, Muller, Ozil, Gundogan, Gotze\n\nGeorgia XI: Revishvili, Lobzhanidze, Kverkvelia, Kashia, Amisulashvili, Khizanishvili, Navalovsky, Kankava, Kazaishvili, Okriashvili, Mchedlidze\n\nHungary XI: Kir\u00e1ly, Leandro, K\u00e1d\u00e1r, Fiola, Guzmics, Elek, Dzsudzs\u00e1k, Kalm\u00e1r, Szalai, Gera, N\u00e9meth\n\n19:05 Germany stars Andre Schuerrle (left) and Mats Hummels (right) take a stroll around Hampden Park prior-to kick-off 18:55 Scotland, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland teams are out\n\nScotland XI: Marshall, Hutton, Mulgrew, R.Martin.

has become a signature event for Major League Soccer, but over the years it has become a bit less about showcasing the players who are actually performing the best at the time of the game.\n\nTraditionally, All-Star Games feature the players who have earned their way into the game because of performance rather than reputation. The recent MLB All-Star Game was a good showcase of that, as it often is.\n\nUnlike baseball's summer showcase, the MLS event is a bit less a talent showcase and more of a party where the hosts don't mind playing favorites, and big names earn invites even when they may not be performing up to par.\n\nRelated A night to remember: D.C. United finally opens a home of its own Ibrahimovic, Almiron lead Goal's MLS midseason award winners Rooney's quality shows through in winning debut for D.C. United Timbers sign Argentina youth international Conechny\n\nFor starters, the all-star game features just one team of MLS players. Unlike the NFL, NBA or MLB, which put together competing teams made up of players from opposing conferences or leagues. MLS used to have that format, but changed it in 2005 to consist of a team of MLS stars against whichever foreign club could be secured as an opponent. In the dozen years since, we have seen the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid take part, and this year the game will feature Italian giant Juventus.\n\nAn argument could be made that the league has outgrown that format with the number of teams having doubled and the league boasting growing number of stars that could be chosen for such a match. The record-setting fan base in Atlanta would still fill Mercedes-Benz Stadium if the match was East versus West, and there would be plenty of star power for both sides to make it a memorable contest.\n\nSetting aside the format aspect of the MLS All-Star Game discussion, the process to select players to play in the current format leaves plenty to be desired. Fans are allowed to vote on the first 11, a group of players that automatically make the all-star team, but don't necessarily start in the match. Atlanta's sizable fanbase did its part to stuff the ballot box, and succeeded in securing places for six Atlanta United players in the Fan XI (one of which -- Darlington Nagbe -- wound up having to miss out due to injury).\n\nThe rest of the squad is chosen by the coach of the team from the host market, which happens to be Atlanta United's Gerardo Martino (MLS commissioner Don Garber also gets to select two players, which are usually big star players or top young talents). MLS All-Star coaches have free rein to select any group of players they wish, and in the past we have seen coaches make choices based on personal preference and tactical necessity much more so than based on actual performance during the season in question. The idea is generally to try and build a group that can function well as a team, but some coaches have taken that premise a bit too far.\n\nMartino's selections weren't the worst we have ever seen, but he had a few choices that probably wouldn't have made the cut if voting were made by a consensus of coaches. As a result, some very deserving candidates have been left off the list (at least for now, there are still two weekends worth of matches to be played before the MLS All-Star Game on August 1).\n\nHere are the five players who Goal sees being the biggest snubs from the MLS All-Star Game:\n\nMAXI MORALEZ, NYCFCThe New York City FC playmaker has been one of the very best players in the league through the first half of the season, compiling seven goals an 10 assists for an NYCFC squad one point out of first place in the Supporter's Shield race. He is one assist off the MLS lead, and has scored twice as many goals as any other player with double-digit assists.\n\nUnfortunately for Moralez, all-star voters put both Miguel Almiron and Ezequiel Barco on the squad, and when Martino selected Valeri, it left no room for another playmaker. You have to think that Moralez would be the first player called upon if any of the aforementioned players (or commissioner's pick Sebastian Giovinco) is unable to play.\n\nKEMAR LAWRENCE, New York Red Bulls\n\nThe lack of fullback selections, and total absence of natural left backs, makes it seem likely that Martino will deploy a three-man defense against Juventus, which makes sense given the strengths of the MLS talent pool. That said, it's a harsh exclusion for Lawrence, who has been the best left back in the league this year. The Jamaican speedster has not only maintained his stingy one-on-one defending, but he has also become more of an attacking threat for the Red Bulls.\n\nTo be fair to Martino, he did select two other Red Bulls defenders in Aaron Long and Michael Murillo, but the Red Bulls boast the best defense in the league and Lawrence has been a big reason for that.\n\nSEBASTIAN BLANCO, Portland Timbers\n\nThe Portland Timbers are riding a league-best 11-match unbeaten streak and a big reason for their success has been the improved play of Blanco, who you can argue has outperformed teammate and reigning MLS MVP Valeri this season. Blanco has compiled five goals and six assists, numbers which don't do justice to the constant threat he has provided for the Timbers attack. He has helped prevent teams from keying in on Valeri, and has also improved his defensive contributions.\n\nUnfortunately for Blanco, he was unlikely to be included along with Valeri, but there are few midfielders in the league who have been more effective than he has been so far this season.\n\nMATT TURNER, New England Revolution\n\nReputation always plays a part in all-star selections, so being a breakout player in the middle of his first season as a pro starter probably isn't a good place to be in order to draw all-star game consideration. That being said, Turner has been outstanding for New England, and is currently looking like the front runner for MLS Goalkeeper of the Year honors. The 24-year-old should have ample time to play himself onto future all-star teams though, so don't feel too bad for him.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBrad Guzan was the fan's choice, and you can't really blame anybody for that pick even if he did benefit from Atlanta ballot-stuffing. Credit should go to Martino for selecting Zack Steffen, who is the same goalkeeper who helped eliminate Atlanta United from the playoffs a year ago.\n\nROLAND LAMAH, FC Dallas\n\nFC Dallas is tied for the best points-per-game average and sits in first place in the West, yet managed just one player -- Matt Hedges -- on the all-star team. That's way too light. Martino should have found room for Lamah, who provides speed and versatility in the attack and who has been instrumental in FCD's impressive first half.\n\nOther players who can be called all-star snubs include Diego Chara, Christian Penilla, Darwin Quintero, Reggie Cannon and Tyler Adams.", "Real Madrid 4-0 Osasuna: Ronaldo continues return as Real keep up the pressure on Atletico, but Bale misses out\n\nBy Pete Jenson for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 15:51 EDT, 26 April 2014 | Updated: 04:05 EDT, 27 April 2014\n\nA Cristiano Ronaldo double took his league tally to 30 goals and kept up Real Madrid's chances of landing the club's first ever treble.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's expression as Ronaldo's spectacular second flew in summed up the sense that with the Fifa World Player of the Year in this form anything is possible with four games left.\n\nThe Madrid players presented the recently won Copa del Rey to supporters before the game and with the three points Madrid moved ahead of Barcelona into second place behind Atletico Madrid who play Valencia on Sunday.\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to watch the best of Cristiano Ronaldo\n\n...\n\n.....\n\nHappy days: Real celebrate another important win as they target glory in La Liga\n\nSweet embrace: Ronaldo hugs fellow Portugal international Fabio Coentrao after scoring his second goal\n\nAtletico are still in pole position but Real's shadow looms large ready for any slip from Diego Simeone's team.\n\nAncelotti, who distanced himself from the Manchester United job on Friday saying 'my place is here at the moment', left Gareth Bale out of his squad giving the Welshman three extra days to recover from the virus he suffered last week. But the Italian coach saw his team cruise to victory with Ronaldo opening the scoring after just six minutes.\n\nIt was the 7th consecutive league game he had scored in. His dipping right-foot shot took a deflection as it flew past a helpless Andres Fernandez.\n\nThere was no let up in the Ronaldo show as he crossed for Sergio Ramos in one lightning counter-attack with the defender getting under the ball and sending it over. He also sent a free-kick just past the post on the half hour with Fernandez looking well-beaten.\n\nThere was something completely different from the Ronaldo free-kick repertoire on 37 minutes when he dinked a delicate pass into the penalty area with all of Osasuna expecting another rocket shot. Again it was Ramos on the end of the assist and again he sent his effort over.\n\nOut of action: Gareth Bale was not in the squad for Real's win against Osasuna\n\nHeads you lose: Sergio Ramos missed two good chances for Real in the first-half against Osasuna\n\nThird time lucky: But the defender got the goal he craved in the second-half thanks\n\nWorth the wait: Ramos celebrated the strike in style with a couple of back flips\n\nSuper sub: Daniel Carvajal added a late fourth goal for Real, heading home Isco's lofted pass\n\nRonaldo got his second on 51 minutes drifting in from the left and again unleashing an unstoppable right foot shot that this time needed no deflection as it went past Fernandez off the underside of his crossbar.\n\nRamos then headed in Angel Di Maria's cross to make it three on the hour and that was the cue for Ronaldo to be taken off ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg.\n\nWith the clock running down full-back Dani Carvajal looped a header over Fernandez from Isco's lofted pass to make it four.\n\nMadrid can now prepare for what many believe is their biggest game in over a decade.

Switzerland are a talented side but Albania and Romania are certainly minnows.\n\nBelow, former England defender Keown breaks down each team including star men, ones to watch and his view for their tournament prospects.\n\nFrance team have been gearing up for the European Championship on home soil - which kicks off on Friday\n\nFRANCE\n\nManager: Didier Deschamps\n\nEric Cantona once described Deschamps as 'the water carrier' -- meaning his role was to pass the ball to more talented players -- and he never spilt a drop. He was a terrific leader too, captaining France to tournament victories at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, so he looks like the perfect man for the job if they are to claim glory again.\n\nDidier Deschamps was once described as a 'water carrier' by Eric Cantona but he is a terrific leader\n\nHow far will they go?\n\nI'd put them down as one of the favourites -- they're formidable at tournaments on home soil. I commentated on their quarter-final against Germany at the 2014 World Cup and they were very unlucky to lose that match to the eventual winners.\n\nI would be concerned, though, about their depth at centre forward. With Karim Benzema absent, the goalscoring duties fall to Olivier Giroud, who can act as the backboard for their talented midfielders but cannot always be relied upon to hit the back of the net himself. Also, the fact they haven't played a competitive game for two years might be an issue.\n\nStar man: Paul Pogba\n\nThe Juventus man is the pick of an athletic central midfield. He has explosive pace and has become so powerful -- we've seen him turn into a man over the past couple of years. There is always a special feeling when France play at home -- Thierry Henry came of age at the 1998 World Cup and this could be Pogba's time.\n\nPaul Pogba (right) is hoping to lead hosts France to Euro 2016 glory under manager Deschamps' guidance\n\nOne to watch: Kingsley Coman\n\nI really like the look of this 19-year-old Bayern Munich winger. He has excellent pace and dribbling ability and can be a full back's worst nightmare on his day. He could be a real game-changer.\n\nFancy that\n\nThe first European Championship match -- between France and Yugoslavia in 1960 -- is still the highest scoring in tournament history. Hosts France were beaten 5-4.\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nManager: Vladimir Petkovic\n\nWon the Coppa Italia with Lazio in 2013 before being sacked in January 2014 and was appointed by Switzerland the following summer.\n\nVladimir Petkovic was given the Switzerland job in 2014 on the back of his work with Lazio\n\nHow far will they go?\n\nThey should get through their group for the first time in the competition and will fancy their chances of going further. But their run might end in the quarter-finals, where Spain would be their likely opponents.\n\nStar man: Xherdan Shaqiri\n\nThe 24-year-old midfielder has enjoyed a fine season with Stoke and was top-scorer in qualifying for Switzerland, netting four of their 24 goals and setting up another four.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri has enjoyed a fine season with Stoke and was top-scorer in qualifying for Switzerland\n\nOne to watch: Granit Xhaka\n\nArsenal fans will be keen to catch a glimpse of their new \u00a335million midfield capture from Borussia Monchengladbach. The 23-year-old already has more than 40 caps.\n\nFancy that\n\nIt will be Xhaka versus Xhaka for Switzerland's opening game against Albania. Granit will come up against older brother Taulent, a defender at Basle. Both brothers were born in the Swiss capital to Kosovar Albanian parents.\n\nROMANIA\n\nManager: Anghel Iordanescu\n\nThe 66-year-old is in his third spell as Romania manager, coming out of retirement in October 2014 to take charge.\n\nAnghel Iordanescu loves managing Romania - the 66-year-old is in his third spell in charge of his county\n\nHow far will they go?\n\nThey are unlikely to come through the group. There are big concerns over their firepower -- they scored just 11 in qualifying.\n\nStar man: Vlad Chiriches\n\nThe former Spurs centre back, now with Napoli, is the rock in a defence which let in just two goals in qualifying.\n\nVlad Chiriches endured a torrid spell with Tottenham but is a vital piece in Romania's defensive jigsaw\n\nOne to watch: Nicolae Stanciu\n\nThe midfielder has won just five caps and already scored four goals for Romania. The 23-year-old Steaua Bucharest star made his international debut in March and could prove to be one of the surprise stars.\n\nFancy that\n\nRomania hold the longest current unbeaten run against England. They have won three and drawn four from their last seven meetings, last losing at the 1970 World Cup, when Geoff Hurst scored the only goal in a group-stage win in Mexico..\n\nALBANIA\n\nManager: Gianni De Biasi\n\nNow in his fifth year as Albania boss, the Italian received the Honor of Nation Order for guiding them to Euro 2016. He won promotion to Serie A with Torino in 2006, was sacked three days before the first game of 2006- 2007 and reinstated in February 2007.\n\nGiovanni de Biasi may be a journeyman manager but he has been exceptional while in charge of Albania\n\nHow far will they go?\n\nThey will be lucky to escape the group, though they did beat France 1-0 in a friendly last year.\n\nStar man: Lorik Cana\n\nThe captain and Nantes defender became the first Albanian to play in the Premier League when he skippered Sunderland in the 2009-10 season.\n\nEx-Sunderland man Lorik Cana was stellar in qualification as Albania reached their first ever tournament\n\nOne to watch: Ergys Kace\n\nThe 22-year-old midfielder's free-kick gave Albania that historic victory over France last June.\n\nFancy that\n\nIn 2013, Albania became the second country, after North Korea, not to be invited to bid for Premier League TV rights amid piracy fears.\n\nGROUP A EURO 2016 FIXTURES\n\nFriday, June 10: France v Romania (20:00, Stade de France, Paris)\n\nSaturday, June 11: Albania v Switzerland (14:00, Stade Bollaert-Delelis, Lens)\n\nWednesday, June 15: Romania v Switzerland (17:00, Parc des Princes, Paris)\n\nWednesday, June 15: France v Albania (20:00, Stade Velodrome, Marseille)\n\nSunday, June 19: Romania v Albania (20:00, Stade de Lyon)\n\nSunday, June 19: Switzerland v France (20:00, Stade Pierre Mauroy, Lille)", "When Romania walk out alongside France to get the European Championship underway on Friday night, plenty of football fans of a certain age will find themselves thinking of a certain Gheorghe Hagi.\n\nHagi is for many the embodiment of Romanian football and even of the country itself. Their greatest footballing export, Hagi was master and 'Comandante' at a time when Romania were the very definition of the stalking tournament 'dark horse.'\n\nWhether for his country, whom he represented in three World Cups and three European Championships, or for his clubs Steaua Bucharest, Real Madrid, Brescia, Barcelona and Galatasaray, the playmaker was an icon.\n\nGheorghe Hagi falls to his knees after scoring for Romania against Argentina at the 1994 World Cup\n\nHagi was a magician with the ball and his exploits on the field made him the embodiment of Romanian football\n\nROMANIA TEAM VS COLOMBIA - WORLD CUP 1994\n\nRomania: Bogdan Stelea; Dan Petrescu, Daniel Prodan, Miodrag Belodedici; Ioan Lupescu, Gheorghe Popescu, Dorinel Munteanu; Florin R\u0103ducioiu; Gheorghe Hagi (c), Ilie Dumitrescu, Gheorghe Mihal.\n\nAt Galatasaray, he was 'Comandante' (the commander). In his homeland, he was simply 'Regele' (the King). Everywhere, he was nicknamed rather classically 'The Maradona of the Carpathians'.\n\nHow Romania manager Anghel Iordanescu, who had the pleasure of Hagi in his team at three 1990s tournaments, must wish for a similar sprinkling of stardust in his squad for the Euros this summer in his third spell with the national team.\n\nThe beauty of Hagi was his unpredictability. Comfortable on both feet, his play could seldom be read by opponents. He had a wide array of skills and tricks, a terrifying burst of speed, good vision and a blistering shot both in open play and from set-plays.\n\nWatch a montage of his finest goals and you soon realise that Hagi didn't believe neither in distance nor in the laws of physics.\n\nWhether 30, 40, 50 yards from goal, the explosive power in Hagi's (usually) left boot meant he unfailingly backed himself to hit the target, from any angle.\n\nOften, his shots were struck with such vicious power that goalkeepers would only see them when it was far too late, perhaps belatedly stretching out an arm, only for the ball already to be in the net.\n\nIt was in the 1994 World Cup in the United States that Hagi shot to prominence on the world stage.\n\nIn their opening game, before 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, his absolutely outrageous lob from wide on the left wing helped Romania to a 3-1 win over Colombia. The moment has become a staple of World Cup greatest goals compilations, so helpless was keeper Oscar Cordoba.\n\nThough Romania were thrashed 4-1 by Roy Hodgson's Switzerland team in their next match, they defeated hosts USA in their final match to advance.\n\nHagi's performances at the 1994 World Cup saw him shoot to prominence as a player of true ability\n\nHagi drew worldwide praise for the way he dictated play in the midfield.\n\nIn the last 16, the Romanians beat Argentina - minus the disgraced Diego Maradona - 3-2 in what was rightly regarded the most thrilling match of the tournament.\n\nAfter Ilie Dumitrescu opened the scoring with a free-kick, Hagi dissected the Argentine defence with just one pass to tee up Dumitrescu for the second. He then supplied a cool finish for the decisive third in one of his finest performances.\n\nIn some quarters, Romania were being tipped to go all the way but everything unravelled as they lost to 10-man Sweden on penalties in the quarter-finals after losing their lead five minutes from the end of extra time.\n\nThough Hagi would appear in later tournaments, this really was the high water mark of Romania's expressive 'Golden Generation.' But it was only one of many highlights in Hagi's career.\n\nHe was already an international by the time he joined his country's leading club, Steaua Bucharest in 1987, going on to score prolifically in the Romanian top flight and helping them to the European Cup final in 1989.\n\nHagi's 17-year international career - which spanned 125 caps and 35 goals - started with an appearance against Norway as a teenager in 1983.\n\nThe abiding memory of his first World Cup in 1990 was his head-to-head with Maradona in the group stage draw with Argentina, with Hagi booked for a petulant kick out at his opposite number after he felt he'd been fouled.\n\nThe Communist government of Nicolae Ceausescu had earlier denied Hagi moves to Milan and Bayern Munich, but the lifting of the Iron Curtain meant he was signed by Real Madrid after the 1990 tournament.\n\nHagi has gone down in history as one of Romania's true superstars, scoring 35 goals in 125 appearances\n\nHagi is challenged for the ball during the 1994 World Cup. He went on to sign for Barcelona afterwards\n\nHe spent two seasons at the Bernabeu, then two in Italy with Brescia, guiding them back to Serie A after they suffered relegation in his debut season.\n\nThose stellar performances at USA '94 persuaded Barcelona to sign him but, the odd spectacular goal aside, he struggled at times.\n\nIn 1996, Hagi moved to Galatasaray, enjoying the best spell of his career. He was a crucial member of a team that dominated Turkish football and won four consecutive league titles, as well as the UEFA Cup in 2000 when they beat Arsenal on penalties.\n\nNot that it was an auspicious occasion for Hagi, sent off for punching Arsenal skipper Tony Adams in the back early in extra time.\n\nHe was a hero to the Galatasaray fans and those glorious years brought down the curtain on his career.\n\nHagi was part of the peroxide-blonde Romania team that beat England at the 1998 World Cup, setting up Viorel Moldovan for his goal with a nice lob, though on the whole his performances were average.\n\nHe even received a call-up for Euro 2000, but his international career ended in ignominy when he received two yellow cards inside four minutes during their 2-0 quarter-final loss to Italy.\n\nHagi later had various unsuccessful managerial spells and now runs an academy in Romania. His son Ianis plays in the Romanian league with Viitorul and is tipped for good things.\n\nBut it is the image of that yellow shirt with the No 10 on the back, gliding so effortlessly between defenders or smacking home an astonishing 40-yarder, that will stay with us forever.\n\nHagi in action against France and Zinedine Zidane for Romania during their Euro 96 campaign in England", "France and Switzerland shared the spoils in a lacklustre 0-0 draw at the Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille.\n\nPaul Pogba, who was recalled to the starting XI along with Antoine Griezmann, was irrepressible in the first-half - making a goal line clearance and coming close to opening the scoring on several occasions, but neither side could break the deadlock.\n\nWest Ham revelation Dimitri Payet was introduced in the second-half and was only denied the opener by the crossbar after a stunning break before the game petered out to a stalemate that suited both sides.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MATT BARLOW'S MATCH REPORT FROM LILLE\n\nMatt Maltby\n\nHost commentator\n\nAuto-update 21:55 That's all for me tonight, folks...\n\nThanks for joining me this evening, folks.

Been a bit of a disappointment tonight. Giroud is about to come on while Koscielny has just been booked for a late challenge on Lichtsteiner.\n\nPogba shoots in the first half 21:36\n\n79 min: It's becoming a similar theme isn't it? With the clock ticking, France finally move through the gears and it's that man Payet who is pulling the strings at the moment. He's completely changed the game since coming on and has just had another shot on target which flies narrowly wide of Sommer's goal.\n\n21:35 Substitution for Switzerland\n\nStoke City winger Shaqiri is replaced by former Manchester City midfielder Fernandes.\n\n21:33 Substitution for France\n\nMatuidi comes on for Griezmann.\n\n21:32 Payet smashes the crossbar\n\n74 min: What a goal that would have been. Sissoko, who has done little tonight, shows exceptional pace to surge clear down the right flank and the Newcastle winger whips in a wonderful ball to the back post where Payet was waiting. The West Ham playmaker smashed a volley goalwards but it cannons off the bar and the Swiss scramble the ball to danger. Close.\n\nFrance's Antoine Griezmann reacts after missing chance 21:30 Substitution for Switzerland\n\nSeferovic, who has endured a frustrating tournament so far, comes on for the impressive Embolo. He should be pleased with his performance tonight against France - he's worked hard on his own and has shown glimpses of his potential.\n\nSwitzerland's Behrami fights for the ball against France's Griezmann 21:28\n\n70 min: Lovely play from Pogba and Griezmann almost sees Gignac clear through on goal but the striker fails to read the latter's dummy and Switzerland clear.\n\n21:26\n\n69 min: This game has gone a bit flat at the moment so I wouldn't be surprised if both teams make changes soon - although Switzerland will take this result if it remains this way.\n\nFrance's Hugo Lloris and Paul Pogba in action 21:25\n\n67 min: Switzerland need Shaqiri to perform but the Stoke City winger just hasn't turned up tonight.

Payet has been thrown into the mix as he comes on for Coman.\n\n21:17\n\n60 min: Fifteen minutes played in this half and Switzerland have had 69 per cent possession. Shows how impressive they've been following the break while France haven't turned up yet.\n\nFrance's Hugo Lloris gathers from Switzerland's Breel Embolo 21:16\n\n59 min: Pogba uses his strength to win a free-kick - excellent play by the Juventus man there. But he needlessly tried the Cruyff turn in the build-up. Needs to try and play the simple ball rather than trickery tonight.\n\nValon Behrami of Switzerland with a punctured ball 21:14\n\n56 miin: Best chance of this half and Griezmann will look back on that and agree he should be scoring (I hope...). The Frenchman links up well with Pogba and Gignac but he scoops his right-footed shot and it's straight at Sommer. Needed to go for the corner, there.\n\n21:13\n\n55 min: France are struggling to find any sort of rhythm in this half and Deschamps is being very vocal on the touchline at the moment. The Swiss, on the other hand, look dangerous.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps watches from the sidelines 21:11 The ball has popped...\n\n53 min: We don't see this too often but the ball has just popped... Griezmann looks to be in following a poor backpass but Behrami comes to the rescue for the Swiss but tackling the Frenchman with a well-timed challenge - and he pops the ball in the process.\n\nKingsley Coman of France in action against Granit Xhaka 21:09\n\n52 min: Seems Rodriguez was given orders to attack more this half. The defender was quiet in the first-half but is enjoying much more success down the left flank in the opening seven minutes of this half.\n\n21:08\n\n50 min: Rodriguez's cross is blocked by Sagna and goes out for a corner. The left back swings in a delivery but France, as they have done throughout this match, are able to clear the ball with ease. The deliveries tonight have been awful.\n\nFrance fans 21:05\n\n47 min: Cabaye, perhaps France's best player in the first 45 minutes, does superbly to stay with Shaqiri and clear the danger. He's been impressive tonight, the Crystal Palace star.\n\n21:03\n\n46 min: Less than a minute played in this second half and Switzerland almost silence the stadium with an opener. Embolo is clear down the right flank but the striker's cross is well dealt with by Koscielny. A slighter better ball in and France could have been in all sorts of danger there.\n\n21:02 SECOND-HALF: Albania restart the match against Romania 21:01 SECOND-HALF: Switzerland restart the match\n\nThe second-half is under way with the Swiss, in red and white, kicking off from right to left.\n\n21:00 Chris Hatherall in Lyon\n\nJust been an announcement at half time asking people throwing objects onto the pitch to stop immediately..\n\n20:58 The pitch isn't in the best condition...

France just haven't got going yet and Gignac is cutting a very lonely figure up front by himself.\n\nFrance's Paul Pogba in action with Switzerland's Breel Embolo 20:40\n\n39 min: The pitch isn't in great condition tonight and many players are finding it hard to stay on their feet... Pogba slipped earlier on in this match and two Swiss players have just followed suit.\n\nSwitzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri sustains a facial injury 20:37\n\n36 min: Pogba has just climbed over the back of Embolo in hilarious fashion. Good refereeing by the official to allow Switzerland to play on.\n\nAndre-Pierre Gignac in action against Fabian Schaer 20:36 Romania 0-0 Albania\n\nIt's still goalless in the other Group A match where Romania are dominating possession.\n\nRomania's Alexandru Matel challenges for the ball with Albania's Andi Lila 20:35\n\n32 min: It's France who are dominating possession and they've just won a corner. Griezmann whips it in but Switzerland clear. Coman and Co trying to be a bit too clever at the moment. The youngster is attempt to trick his way through the Swiss defence rather than play the simple ball...\n\nBreel Embolo of Switzerland and Yohan Cabaye of France compete 20:32\n\n30 min: All eyes are on Pogba this evening after he was dropped for the Albania win following a poor performance in their opener against Romania. The Juventus star certainly has a point to prove and is a man on a mission in Lille. He's almost just created a goal scoring opportunity but loses his footing which allows the Swiss to regroup.\n\nFrance's Adil Rami fouls Switzerland's Admir Mehmedi 20:29\n\n28 min: Embolo is through and tries a cheeky toe-poke which hits Koscielny in the midriff and the defender certainly felt that. The Swiss win a corner but Shaqiri's delivery doesn't beat the first man and France clear to safety.\n\nPaul Pogba of France reacts 20:28\n\n26 min: Coman does brilliantly to beat Lichtsteiner with a lovely bit of trickery before the defender pulls the Frenchman back with a needless foul. Still 0-0 in both Group A matches.\n\nSwitzerland keeper Sommer dives for wide ball 20:26 Booking for France\n\n24 min: Rami gets the first booking of the match for a high foot on Mehmedi. The Swiss midfielder rolled around on the floor for about 10 seconds there - he's given me a bit of a headache....\n\nFrance's Hugo Lloris Marine Lloris, wife of France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the stands 20:24\n\n23 min: I mentioned Sommer having a good tournament earlier... Well the goalkeeper is looking shaky at the moment. He's dealt well with long-range shots but looks vulnerable from set-pieces and has flapped at it on a number of occasions.\n\nLudivine Payet, wife of France's Dimitri Payet in the stands 20:22\n\n21 min: That is a terrible free-kick and France counter-attack through Coman but the midfielder's cross to Griezmann is over-hit.\n\n20:20\n\n20 min: Mehmedi is allowed to move on to his favoured right foot but fires over for Switzerland. Half chance, that. And the Swiss are beginning to threaten now with Embolo winning a free-kick following a foul by Rami.\n\n20:19\n\n18 min: Pogba and Co playing some lovely football now. The Juventus man is involved in nearly every attack for the hosts now - and could have had a hat-trick already... The Swiss are dealing with the French, for now.\n\nFrance's Laurent Koscielny is challenged by Blerim Dzemaili 20:17\n\n16 min: France moving through the gears now, as expected, with Pogba beginning to pull the strings in midfielder. As mentioned by Craig, we're yet to see Sissoko touch the ball. And Pogba has almost just broke the deadlock with a piledriver which hits the crossbar. Inches...\n\nSwitzerland's Yann Sommer in action 20:15 Lloris landmark\n\nCaps as #FRA captain: Lloris equals Deschamps' record (45) \ud83d\udc4f#EURO2016 pic.twitter.com/WlGVU8w1me -- UEFA EURO 2016 (@UEFAEURO)\n\nJune 19, 2016\n\n20:15 Sportsmail's Craig Hope in Lille\n\nAs someone who watches him week in, week out, I do find it difficult to fathom how Moussa Sissoko is starting in the centre of midfield for the tournament favourites. Fifteen minutes in and he's barely had a touch. That's not a bad tactic, for when he does I suspect he'll lose it anyway..\n\nFrance's Adil Rami jumps for the ball ahead of Switzerland's Breel Embolo 20:13\n\n12 min: Pogba is soon involved again and that's a tremendous save from Sommer. Coman plays in the Juventus man in the penalty area and his left-footed drive is dealt with superbly by the Swiss goalkeeper. He's had a good tournament so far.\n\nFrance's Bacary Sagna 20:12 Pogba hits the crossbar\n\n11 min: Great play from France, and Gignac in particular, who holds the ball up well before playing it to Pogba who lets fly with a long-range shot. Sommer can only parry and it fortunately hits the crossbar, rather than dropping into his goal, before the resulting corner is cleared to safety.\n\n20:10 Varane cheering on Les Bleus\n\nAllez les Bleus !!! \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 pic.twitter.com/l5jhki7IqA -- Rapha\u00ebl Varane (@raphaelvarane)\n\nJune 19, 2016\n\n20:10 Romania vs Albania\n\nIt's still 0-0 in Lyon where Romania and Albania are playing in the other Group A match.\n\n20:09\n\n7 min: And Switzerland almost score... A corner is whipped in and Djourou loses his footing in front of goal - and Pogba is able to clear the danger following a scramble in the box. Let off for France, that.\n\nFrance's Yohan Cabaye in action with Switzerland's Admir Mehmedi 20:07\n\n6 min: Huge night for Embolo tonight who makes his first start for Switzerland at Euro 2016. The striker has been involved already and looks lively.\n\nFrance's president Francois Hollande in the stands 20:05\n\n4 min: Four minutes in and Switzerland have begun this game well. France are looking to released Coman at every opportunity but the Swiss are very tight on the Bayern Munich man at the moment. Will be interesting to see how the cope with him tonight.\n\nFrance's Andre Pierre Gignac kicks off the game 20:03\n\n2 min: A corner is whipped in but Switzerland deal with the danger well and immediately break through Embolo. But the French stand firm.\n\n20:02\n\n1 min: Positive start from France who won two corners already in this opening minute.\n\n20:01 Chris Hatherall in Lyon\n\nAlbania definitely outnumbering Romanian fans here - they've turned out in big numbers.\n\nFor UEFA officials on fireworks watch it's not a good start. One banger has already gone off in the Albania end- and Romania fans held up a flare during their national anthem. Stewards moved in to put it out. Croatia, Turkey and Hungary are already in trouble for throwing flares on the pitch so UEFA desperate to stamp it out..\n\n20:00 KICK-OFF: France get us under way\n\nWe're under way with France kick-off from right to left.\n\n19:57 Plenty of colour on show in Lille 19:55 Five minutes until kick-off\n\nHere we go then - the players make their way out on to the pitch and Lille for the routine pre-match national anthems and presentations.\n\n19:51 Reminder of the teams\n\nSwitzerland: Sommer, Lichtsteiner, Schar, Djourou, Rodriguez, Behrami, Xhaka, Shaqiri, Dzemaili, Mehmedi, Embolo\n\nSubs: Hitz, Moubandje, Elvedi, von Bergen, Lang, Frei, Seferovic, Zakaria, Fernandes, Tarashaj, Derdiyok, Burki\n\nFrance: Lloris, Sagna, Rami, Koscielny, Evra, Sissoko, Cabaye, Pogba, Coman, Gignac, Griezmann\n\nSubs: Mandanda, Jallet, Kante, Payet, Giroud, Martial, Schneiderlin, Mangala, Matuidi, Digne, Umtiti, Costil\n\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n19:48 Hands up if you're starting... 19:47 Granit Xhaka gearing up for France 19:46 Race for second place\n\nIf Switzerland loses by one goal, Romania wins by one and they score same number of goals, Fair Play Conduct decides which is second & which is third.\n\n19:40 Here he is...

Albania fans show support for their team outside the stadium Albania fans show support for their team Albania fans show support for their team 18:44 HEAD-TO-HEAD: Romania vs Albania\n\nAlbania will be facing off against their least favourite opponents Romania on Sunday - it will be the 16th time they have met, more than any other nation they have faced.\n\nOf those encounters, Albania have only won two meetings and that last win was back in May 1948 and lost their most recent fixture with each other 1-0 in May 2014.\n\n18:41 There's a match going on in Lyon, too...\n\nRomania head into this clash knowing that three points could be enough to take them into the next round but only if Switzerland lose to France.\n\nGiven that Romania have not won at game at the European Championship, since a 3-2 victory over England at Euro 2000, tonight's task may not be as straight forward as it appears.\n\nAlbania can count themselves unlucky after holding their own in the game against Switzerland, before losing 1-0 and then conceding twice late on at the death against France.\n\nParc OL, which is short for Parc Olympique Lyonnais, is the 59,186 capacity stadium home to French side Lyon.\n\nIt is the venue for six Euro 2016 matches and will also be the setting for matches at the 2019 FIFA women's World Cup.\n\nA general view inside the stadium Another view of the stadium which hosts Albania and Romania tonight Albania and Romania kick off at 8pm 18:38 Excitement is gathering pace outside the ground\n\nThe excitement outside Lille's stadium is gathering pace as France and Switzerland prepare to go head-to-head:\n\nSupporters of France ahead of kick-off A France's supporter with the face painted in red, white and blue France fans prior to tonight's match against Switzerland Fans gather outside Lille's stadium 18:35 The stage is set...\n\nOpening in 2012, the Stade Pierre-Mauroy is the new stadium for Lille.\n\nReceiving a five-star rating by UEFA, the ground hosted the 2012 rugby Autumn Internationals and will play host to six matches at Euro 2016.\n\n18:32 Arsene Wenger backs under-fire Paul Pogba\n\nArsene Wenger has come out in defence of fellow Frenchman Paul Pogba by insisting too much is expected of the young midfielder.\n\nThe Arsenal manager has been a keen spectator of the hosts for this summer's European Championship, paying particular interest towards a man heralded as the new talisman for Didier Deschamps's side.\n\nAfter starring for Juventus during the last two seasons, Pogba had been expected to come of age and shine at Euro 2016, but after struggling in the opening win against Romania, he was subsequently relegated to the bench for the game with Albania, but Wenger believes there is no need to panic.\n\n'Too much is expected of Pogba. We forget that he is only 23, and at 23-years-old it's hard to be the leader of France. Guys like Platini or Zidane were also questioned at that age, he said.\n\n'Pogba is still learning the trade. They say he made a bad move [against Albania], but it is a process by which players pass. They start at 20-21 years in the France squad, everyone says: \"you are the most beautiful and the strongest we've ever had\".'\n\n'Gradually this creates expectation, and at 22-23 years you are told: \"Hey buddy, you are not bringing what was expected of you\".'\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY\n\nPaul Pogba has struggled at Euro 2016 for France and was dropped to the bench after a poor first game 18:27 The Swiss boys are in Lille Switzerland's supporters pose and gesture as they gather in the streets of Lille Switzerland's supporters gather and cheer in the main square 18:25 Payet the magician?\n\nDimitri Payet is setting up his #FRA team-mates at record speed at #Euro2016 pic.twitter.com/lfY6SCBfPn -- UEFA EURO 2016 (@Euro16Updates)\n\nJune 19, 2016\n\n18:24 Who's your money on?\n\nFrance have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 11 matches and odds comparison site Easyodds.com shows a best price of 5/4 on Didier Deschamps men scoring twice or more against Switzerland tonight.\n\nFrance are 10/11 for the win.

Easyodds can reveal odds of 5/6 on a goal being scored after the 76th minute in this match.\n\n18:22 Martin Keown's Euro 2016 big match analysis\n\nComan is exciting but Griezmann can be key\n\nHaving already sealed qualification for the last 16, you might think Didier Deschamps would be tempted to experiment with his starting XI and rest a few players against Switzerland. But I can't see that happening.\n\nThey're under pressure to impress at their own tournament and while they have a perfect record from their two games so far, they left it late on both occasions. The key for them is to keep improving throughout the Championships with the core group they have.\n\nI can see Antoine Griezmann returning to the starting XI after his winner against Albania. Kingsley Coman is an exciting talent, but I couldn't see him popping up to score that late winner like Griezmann did.\n\nSwitzerland, who need a point to confirm their passage from Group A, will take heart from the way Albania frustrated France on Wednesday, but the hosts will be keen for confidence boost ahead of the knockout phase.\n\nSunday, 8pm, Lille, Live on BBC1.\n\nVERDICT: France win.\n\nKEY STAT: Nine of France's last 10 European Championship goals have been scored after half-time. At Euro 2016, three of their four goals have come from 89 mins onwards.\n\nBIG MATCH BET: Backing France is buying money. They left it late twice but are through after two wins and with the pressure off, no matter who plays, this should be the game they lay down a marker. Les Bleus are evens.\n\nFrance's Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba during training 18:16 Dimitri Payet has been France's saviour at Euro 2016\n\nMATT BARLOW FOR THE MAIL ON SUNDAY: It is impossible to overstate the Dimitri Payet effect.\n\nAs far as France is concerned, the West Ham striker has saved the day while others have wilted under the pressure of Euro 2016.\n\nHe was hailed as 'a godsend' by France Football after his second goal of the tournament.\n\nWhere would they be without him?

Sportsmail's top 10 bright young stars hoping to fire their country to next summer's World Cup\n\nBy Alex Horlock\n\nPublished: 08:00, 11 October 2013 | Updated: 12:14, 11 October 2013\n\nThe absence of the Premier League needn't be too taxing over the coming days, as the international break still has a few surprises to throw up.\n\nWith some teams already qualified and others fighting for a World Cup spot, some managers are blooding in young stars in a bid to prepare them for the rigours of a major tournament - or as a last-ditch gamble to book their ticket to Brazil.\n\nHere are Sportsmail's top 10 picks of the youthful international talents on show as the World Cup qualifying stage draws to a close.\n\nDRAXLER ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 20 Position: Attacking midfielder Caps: 7 Goals: 1 Upcoming matches: Republic of Ireland (Home, Friday October 11), Sweden (Away, Tuesday October 15)\n\nJulian Draxler - Germany/Schalke\n\nMario Gotze, Marco Reus, Thomas Muller, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil... Need I go on? Germany have a wealth of talent in attacking midfield, but manager Joachim Low has brought another one into the fold of late.\n\nSchalke's Julian Draxler looks destined to be in Low's squad in Brazil having dazzled in the Bundesliga over the past two years.\n\nProdigious: Julian Draxler is likely to make Joachim Low's Germany squad for the World Cup\n\nDraxler, who turned 20 last month, scored 11 goals last campaign and has already drawn comparisons with Germany legend Michael Ballack - despite playing in a slightly more advanced role. He's been capped seven times already and scored against the USA in June.\n\nHe netted with a neat finish against Steaua Bucharest last month in the Champions League and will be out to do some damage if given the chance against the Republic of Ireland on Friday. The Germans need to avoid defeat to qualify as Group C winners.\n\nThe next Ballack? Draxler has been compared to the Germany legend despite playing a more advanced role\n\nICARDI ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 20 Position: Forward Caps: 0 Upcoming matches: Peru (Home, Saturday October 12), Uruguay (Away, Wednesday October 16)\n\nMauro Icardi - Argentina/Inter Milan\n\nEligible to play for Spain, Italy and Argentina, Icardi finally got what he wanted when Alejandro Sabella came calling.\n\nThe Argentina coach included the Inter Milan forward in his side to provide cover for an injured Lionel Messi - no pressure then.\n\nIcardi, who was born in Rosario, Argentina, caught the eye of Italy coach Cesare Prandelli too after some stunning performances for Sampdoria last term. But he wasn't interested when the Italians came calling.\n\nWelcome aboard: Mauro Icardi (left) was delighted to have been selected by Argentina\n\n'Everybody in Italy knows that I'm Argentine and that the only Italian thing about me is a passport,' he said after being called up. 'It was a great honour what Prandelli said about me, but I'm Argentine and want to play for Argentina.'\n\nArgentina have been rampant in the qualifying campaign so far, scoring 30 times in the 14 games and losing just once.\n\nIcardi will hope to carry his fine Serie A form onto the international stage in a late bid to secure his place on the plane. But it's not just Messi he's in competition with. Gonzalo Higuain, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Carlos Tevez, Angel di Maria and one Sergio Aguero are all likely to be in Sabella's squad too.\n\nHe should get a run out in the break, with Argentina's qualification already assured.\n\nVIDEO: Watch Mauro Icardi in action\n\nINISGNE ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 22 Position: Forward Caps: 3 Goals: 1 Upcoming matches: Denmark (Away, Friday October 11), Armenia (Home, Tuesday October 15)\n\nLorenzo Insigne - Italy/Napoli\n\nThe Napoli forward is an undoubted talent. He has the dogged tenacity of Antonio Cassano and shades of the diminutive Antonio di Natale with his wonderful first-touch and busy dribbling style.\n\nHe's become an integral cog in Rafa Benitez's attacking machine, with Marek Hamsik, Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon also helping Napoli to second in Serie A.\n\nCall up: Lorenzo Insigne (front left) will want to seal his place in Cesare Prandelli's squad\n\nTalent: Insigne has undoubted ability but had little impact in Napoli's defeat by Arsenal\n\nA dead-ball expert, Insigne may also rival Andrea Pirlo for free-kicks if he gets a decent run in Cesare Prandelli's senior squad.\n\nHe netted a stunner against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League this season and - to England's despair - swung one in the top corner past Jack Butland in the European Under 21 Championships.\n\nThe Naples-born Insigne is tiny - barely over 5ft 3in tall - but is blessed with a wonderful first touch and a devastating turn of pace.

Emerging talents Isco and Thiago Alcantara have joined the senior ranks after stunning displays in the European Under 21 Championships, but breaking into a midfield that already consists of David Silva, Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Juan Mata, Xabi Alonso and Cesc Fabregas is no mean feat.\n\nBut Atletico Madrid midfielder Jorge 'Koke' Resurreccion appears to be doing just that. The 21-year-old playmaker has picked up three caps already and looks set to book a place on the plane to Brazil.\n\nTickets booked? Atletico Madrid's Koke hopes to have done enough to reach the World Cup in Brazil\n\nAlong with top scorer Diego Costa and David Villa, Koke has been instrumental in Atletico's ascent to the top of La Liga (second to Barcelona on goal difference) and has scored twice this season as he looks to build on a coming-of-age 2012/13 season.\n\nNot only did he hit the bar in the Madrid derby at the Bernabeu, Koke helped Filipe Luis keep Gareth Bale quiet when the \u00a386million man came off the bench in the second half.\n\nAnd Koke is at home among Spain's pass masters. He has the most assists in La Liga this season. Six in total, the same number as Barcelona's Fabregas. He'll be going head to head with Chelsea's Mata for a starting place in Friday's game against Belarus.\n\nKeeping quiet: Koke played brilliantly in the Madrid derby, and helped keep Gareth Bale out\n\nPaving the way: Koke slid a delightful ball behind the Madrid defence for Diego Costa to score\n\nVIDEO: Watch Atletico Madrid's Koke in action\n\nPOGBA ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 20 Position: Midfielder Caps: 3 Goals: 1 Upcoming matches: Australia (Home, Friday October 11 (friendly)), Finland (Home, Tuesday October 15)\n\nPaul Pogba - France/Juventus\n\nPogba was tipped for stardom during his time at Manchester United, with fellow Frenchman and former club-mate Patrice Evra this week rueing the Premier League champions' decision to let him leave for Juventus.\n\nBut he's plying his trade in the middle of the park for the Italian giants now. Rubbing shoulders with Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal at the Stadio Delle Alpi and keeping Italy midfielder Claudio Marchisio in the shade.\n\nEmerging talent: Paul Pogba has come on leaps and bounds while at Serie A club Juventus\n\nUnstoppable: Pogba (right) has become an integral member of the Juve midfield\n\nPogba left Old Trafford because he wasn't being given the first-team opportunities he felt he deserved. And at Juve, Anotonio Conte has put his faith in the 20-year-old, who looks all the better for his run in the first-team.\n\nHe seems to have it all: Aggression, speed, power and an eye for a pass. He's picked up the knack of scoring the odd goal too. A decisive header against Torino here, a couple of absolute rippers against Udinese there.\n\nHe also popped up in the box to net his first for France last month against Belarus. Pogba and Co will want to avoid a play-off by beating FInland at home. The tricky part is, they need World and European champions Spain to slip up. Bonne chance, Paul.\n\nVIDEO: Watch Paul Pogba's wonderful goal against Udinese\n\n...And from a different angle\n\nGRENIER ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 22 Position: Midfielder Caps: 3 Goals: 0 Upcoming matches: Australia (Home, Friday October 11 (friendly)), Finland (Home, Tuesday October 15)\n\nClement Grenier - France/Lyon\n\nAlthough Lyon might be no where near the force they once were, the prodigious Frenchman has hit some form.\n\nHe has three assists in Ligue 1 and has found the back of the net twice in eight games. Grenier is a tall, elegant attacking midfielder, confident with the ball at his feet and able to pick his team-mates out.\n\nHe scored a wonder goal in a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid and is hoping to build on his three caps.\n\nImpressive: Clement Grenier (right) has hit some good form despite being in a faltering Lyon side\n\nFrance will be hoping the technically gifted midfielder will fulfill his potential to a greater extent than his team-mate Yoann Gourcuff. Gourcuff, 27, was tipped for greatness as a young man having moved from Rennes to Milan, but he never quite reached that level.\n\nFor now though, Grenier can only keep doing what he's doing already. Scoring, assisting and did I mention he hits a mean free-kick too? An heir to Juninho Pernambucano perhaps..?\n\nVIDEO: Watch Clement Grenier's sublime free-kick against Stade Rennes\n\nVIDEO: Watch Clement Grenier's audacious finish against Real Madrid\n\nDEPAY ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 19 Position: Winger Caps: 0 Upcoming matches: Hungary (Home, Friday October 11), Turkey (Away, Tuesday October 15)\n\nMemphis Depay - Holland/PSV\n\nEven though it's only October, it's been quite a season for Memphis Depay.\n\nA day after the 19-year-old left winger scored a stunning Europa League goal - his fourth of the season for PSV Eindhoven - he was called up to the Holland squad for the first time.\n\nTaking a punt: Dutch coach Louis van Gaal talks Memphis Depay (right) through some tactics\n\nCrucial: Memphis Depay also netted a stunner for PSV against Odessa in the Europa League\n\nDepay helped revive PSV's hopes in the Europa League when he cut in from the left flank and rifled the ball into the top corner against Odessa.

He's tall, strong is rarely caught in possession.\n\nHe has an almost Robin van Persie-esque knack of clinging onto the ball and creating half a yard of space. But unlike his countryman, Strootman is chipping crossfield passes or exploiting a gap in the opposition's back line, rather than slotting the ball into the back of the net once he's created that yard of space.\n\nHe also has a bite to his game; a brutish streak that allows him to use his height and size to his advantage.\n\nHe's scored once already for Roma in his first six competitive games, but has already notched up seven assists. RVP must love playing with this guy.\n\nWise: Kevin Strootman (left) is an adept passer of the ball and strong in the tackle\n\nNo go: Strootman opted to join Roma rather than Manchester United, who had tracked him all summer\n\nVIDEO: Watch Kevin Strootman's finest moments below\n\nALABA ESSENTIALS\n\nAge: 21 Position: Left back Caps: 26 Goals: 5 Upcoming matches: Sweden (Away, Friday October 11), Faroe Islands (Away, Tuesday October 15)\n\nDavid Alaba - Austria/Bayern Munich\n\nHe may not be new to the international game with 26 caps for Austria, but David Alaba is still only 21.\n\nIt's a shame we're unlikely to see the Bayern Munich left back at the World Cup. Or, on the off-chance that we do, it will be at the expense of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Sweden.\n\nThe Austrian is a rare breed: a full back who is simply brilliant to watch. His conditioning is faultless and for a young man, his positional awareness is pretty on-point too. Perhaps he's been picking up a few tips from old sage and club-mate Philipp Lahm.\n\nHe can operate in a number of positions, including left and central midfield, but has blossomed as a full back under Jupp Heynckes at Bayern.\n\nAnd under Heynckes' successor Pep Guardiola, Alaba was impregnable against Manchester City in the Champions League, marshalling Jesus Navas with relative ease. But his fitness, pace and marauding dribbling down the left allow him to join the attack when his side are in possession.\n\nSensation: David Alaba has proved his worth to Bayern Munich and Austria over the past couple of seasons\n\nHe's got another great asset too: his lethal left foot. Alaba has become renowned for his wonderful long-range efforts, and has scored three times already this season.\n\nSelected for the senior squad when he was just 17, Alaba became the youngest capped player in Austria's history. He's also notched up two Bundesliga titles, two German Cups, two DFL Supercups, a Champions League and a UEFA Supercup. Not bad for a career in its formative phase.\n\nHis club may be the best - or one of the best - in world football, but Alaba, who wears No 8 for his country, is easily the stand-out player in a poor Austria team.\n\nStriking difference: Alaba's powerful left foot sets him apart from other full backs\n\nVIDEO: Watch David Alaba's long-range effort against Juventus", "'I don't know if he will be able to come out': Mourinho admits 20-day Sanchez absence from US tour would be 'really bad' for Manchester United With just days of the window left, United move to beat City and Chelsea to \u00a330m Shaw and Wenger opens up talks on top target Draxler... and who was Jose mocking?\n\nBy Rob Shepherd for MailOnline\n\nPublished: 18:45 EDT, 25 January 2014 | Updated: 21:34 EDT, 25 January 2014\n\nChelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham want Luke Shaw... and a bid of \u00a330m could prise him away from SouthamptonManchester United are ready to offer Wayne Rooney \u00a3300,000-a-week to keep him out of Chelsea's clutchesArsene Wenger set to make a move for Schalke's Julian DraxlerCould Mario Mandzukic and Patrick Herrmann join Juan Mata at Old Trafford?FA should introduce 10-game bans for politically motivated goal salutesAnd which manager was Jose Mourinho mocking in a press conference?\n\nLuke Shaw could become English football's most expensive defender as soon as this week.\n\nManchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea are all hovering around the left back - who could yet break into England's World Cup squad.\n\nTottenham are also very keen to land Shaw, but given the size of his fee is now likely to exceed \u00a330million that could put Spurs out of the equation.\n\nMost wanted: Luke Shaw is being pursued by a raft of Premier League clubs\n\nFriends in high places: The Manchester clubs, Chelsea and Spurs are all keeping tabs on Shaw\n\nAlthough Southampton's reluctant owner Katharina Liebherr has vowed not to sell any players during the transfer window in the wake of the departure of chief executive Nicola Cortese, a bid of over \u00a330m would be hard to resist - especially if the player was loaned back until the end of the season.\n\nCity have indicated they don't want to do any big business in this window while Chelsea say their activities are over.\n\nBut both clubs could agree a buy and lease back deal.\n\nUnited, who are embarking on massive rebuilding, would love to get in first.\n\nThe previous highest fee paid for a defender was the \u00a329m United paid Leeds in 2001 for Rio Ferdinand.\n\nHead-to-head: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (left) and United boss David Moyes (right) both want Shaw\n\nMega deal: Wayne Rooney will be tempted with an incredible \u00a3300,000-a-week wages\n\nManchester United, having refused to allow Wayne Rooney be part of the deal that has taken Juan Mata to Manchester United, are now ready to offer the England striker a contract that would push his weekly wage towards the \u00a3300,000-a-week mark.\n\nAs I revealed two months ago, Rooney has wanted a long-term contract that would cost United in the region of \u00a370m over the next four or five years for him to agree to commit his future to the club.\n\nAs Rooney's contract, which has 18 months left, runs down his bargaining power with United - on the basis they want to keep him - gets stronger given his sell-on fee diminishes. That is why Rooney has thus far stalled on talks.\n\nYet while United want to keep him the club's owners are still wary of being held to ransom by a player who is 28.\n\nThe next few rounds of talks between Rooney, his advisors and United, which we understand re-opened last week as a consequence of the Mata deal, could decide the player's fate.\n\nIf a deal has not been agreed by the summer then despite having held firm this season United could well off load Rooney to Chelsea.\n\nReal Madrid have been linked with a summer move for Rooney as well, but their 'interest' could be well be a bargaining chip thrown into the equation to strengthen the hand of the striker's advisors in their talks with United.\n\nAs revealed by the Football Grapevine last week Schalke's young attacking midfielder Julian Draxler is Arsenal's prime target.\n\nGunners boss Arsene Wenger - who has been a reluctant operator in the January transfer window ever since getting his fingers burned when a \u00a317m commitment was made to sign Jose Antonio Reyes 10 years ago - feels Draxler's German club are asking for too much money for the 20-year-old.\n\nIt is believed Schalke want \u00a334m.\n\nTop man: Julian Draxler, who has won 10 caps for Germany, has been linked with Arsenal\n\nBut talks have been opened up and after several seasons of not bolstering his squad in January then missing out on silverware, Wenger could be prepared to go against his prudent instincts.\n\nFor the record, Reyes is now a bit-part player at Sevilla, the club he joined Arsenal from.\n\nI am hearing that\n\nWest Ham's last minute scattergun approach to strengthen their squad could see them make a move for Cameroon international midfielder Raoul Loe from Spanish club Osasuna. Or Ross McCormack from Leeds.\n\nWest Ham still want centre back Joleon Lescott from Manchester City but are only willing to pay a maximum of half the player's current \u00a390,000 a week wages.\n\nManchester United could yet make at least one more big money signing before the window closes in the wake of landing Juan Mata.\n\nBayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic and Borussia Monchengladbach's Patrick Hermmann are believed to be two targets that United may try and lure in the coming week.\n\nBut so too is Newcastle's midfielder Yohan Cabaye.\n\nPSG want to lure the \u00a317m Frenchman back home but United could move in with a better offer to test the resolve of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley to keep his squad intact.\n\nJose Mourinho has said all his January transfer business is done having added winger Mohamed Salah from Basle after selling Mata.\n\nThe Chelsea boss would still consider a buy and loan back deal for Saints full back Shaw but would prefer to wait until the summer when Mourinho will start further re-shaping of the squad.\n\nRooney is wanted but if he agrees to stay with United Mourinho has set up a \u00a332m deal that would bring Diego Costa to Stamford Bridge from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season.\n\nI am also hearing\n\nFulham could make one last deadline bid for West Ham's midfielder Ravel Morrison who is even more disgruntled on hearing the wage on offer to new signings far exceeds the money he is on with the club, who have yet to make a firm offer to improve his terms.\n\nStop Press\n\nWest Ham have at last lured a striker to help in their battle against relegation, Roma's Italian international Marco Borriello.\n\nAnother Italian international, Antonio Nocerino, also signed for the club on loan.\n\nIt is not clear though whether manager Sam Allardyce has ever seen either player perform.\n\nBorriello has scored just one goal in 11 Serie A games for Roma this season. He has played seven times for Italy but without a goal.\n\nNocerino, who has been displaced by the arrival in Milan of Michael Essien from Chelsea, has played 15 times for Italy and harbours hopes of making their World Cup squad.\n\nMore from Rob Shepherd for MailOnline...

In many ways I make him right and wondered whether it was his first hint that he would be willing to become England manager one day.\n\nTuesday: West Ham long held the record for an aggregate win in the League Cup, achieved with a 10-3 two-legged semi-final drubbing of Cardiff in 1966. But it was lost with a whimper as Man City extended their win to 9-0 to reach the Capital One Cup final. Yet Hammers players were seen laughing and joking with their opponents as the tie wound down. No wonder, abject failure was rewarded with a warm weather training trip to Dubai. Surely a few cold showers would be a better wake-up call.\n\nWednesday: Hats off to Gus Poyet for not throwing in the towel despite relegation fears and fielding his best team who finished off Manchester United to reach the Capital One Cup final. Isn't it strange how a foreign manager respects English tradition more than many of his native counterparts?\n\nThursday: Remember a player called Josh McEachran? He was going to be a shining example of how Chelsea would nurture great young talent. He has now been farmed out to Wigan, his fourth loan club in as many years. And the FA need a commission to work out why there is a lack of English talent rising to the top.\n\nFriday: Juan Mata, as predicted in this column, agrees to leave Chelsea for Manchester United. Given a bit of time the Spaniard could well do for David Moyes what Eric Cantona did for Alex Ferguson.\n\nBackheel\n\nDespite a defiant display in the 2011 FA Cup final Stoke City were eventually beaten 1-0 by Manchester City.\n\nIt meant that despite a proud tradition and having had some of England's all-time greats turn out for them down the years - such as Sir Stanley Matthews and Gordon Banks - Stoke have won just one major trophy in their history.\n\nThat single piece of silverware came in 1972 when Stoke beat Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley to lift the League Cup.\n\nIt was a game that proved the end of that fabled - and it should be remembered relatively short - period when Chelsea were the rock and roll team of English football at the start of the Seventies. All hair and Alan Hudson.\n\nOutgunned: Manchester City beat Stoke 1-0 in 2011's FA Cup final\n\nWinners: Jubilant Chelsea players, John Boyle, Ron Harris and John Dempsey parade the Cup Winner's Cup trophy after a 2-1 win over Real Madrid\n\nHaving won the FA Cup in 1970, then the European Cup Winner's Cup the following year, Chelsea made it three Cup finals in a row when they faced Stoke.\n\nStoke had beaten West Ham in an epic semi-final that after two legs went to two replays and were considered underdogs.\n\nBut although 'King of the King's Road' Peter Osgood equalised Terry Conroy's opening goal, veteran George Eastham hit the winner.\n\nThat defeat by Stoke saw Dave Sexton's exciting side break up and the club go into a long period of decay.\n\nNow the new Chelsea, who have won the Cup four times in the past seven seasons, are aiming to win the trophy for the eighth time in their history.\n\nIt's difficult to see Stoke, managed by former Blues striker Mark Hughes and holder of four FA Cup medals - Chelsea's Ashley Cole has a record seven - stopping their progress to the fifth round.\n\nBut you never know in the Cup, even these days. As Sunderland proved at Manchester United in the Capital One Cup, if a relegation-threatened side goes into a Cup tie with the right attitude and fielding a strong side then the odds can be turned on their head.\n\nFor Stoke fans here is a reminder of how that sole trophy was won.\n\nLibero\n\nIt is no surprise that Sir Alex Ferguson has come out in defiant support of David Moyes.\n\nAfter all Moyes was the manager Ferguson recommended to United's American owners, the Glazers, to succeed him.\n\nSo anyone who has any notion of Moyes being sacked mid-season is just thinking nonsense.\n\nMoyes' position may well come up for internal debate in the summer, especially if United don't qualify for the Champions League.\n\nBut even given that scenario, which would have significant financial implications for debt-laden United, it is still likely that Ferguson in his advisory/ambassadorial role will argue that the club should keep faith in Moyes.\n\nCrashing out: David Moyes attempts to gee up his players before a miserable penalty defeat to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup\n\nApart from taking responsibility for his role in choosing Moyes, Ferguson - at least, within the confines of the United hierarchy - has accepted some of the responsibility for the squad that Moyes inherited not living up to expectations.\n\nOne of the reasons for Ferguson's success and longevity is how he rebuilt and re-invented winning teams of the years.\n\nEven then some of the baton changes weren't that smooth and remember United did end some campaigns trophyless during Fergie's 27 year reign. Although they were never as cut adrift from top as they currently are.\n\nIn his autobiography, Ferguson argues that he had successfully started the process of rebuilding a new United again in the wake of Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs leaving the stage.\n\nAfter all, Ferguson admits he saw Ashley Young as the replacement for Giggs, who still has to turn out.\n\nAnd most of the other players Ferguson speaks of at being the core of a new generation increasingly don't look up to the demands of being part of a successful Manchester United team.\n\nInterested party: Sir Alex Ferguson winces while watching United lose at Stamford Bridge\n\nBut when Moyes took over he was advised that the squad WAS strong enough and just needed a tweak or two and the addition of a magic player.\n\nUnited genuinely felt that man would be either Crisitiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale. But of course neither move materialised as time ran out during last summer's transfer window.\n\nSince then players such as Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Tom Cleverley, Fabio, Rafael, Nani, Danny Welbeck and Young - all cited as cornerstones for the future by Fergie - have not matured or progressed in the required manner.\n\nWith Robin van Persie injured (it was the Dutch striker's stunning form in the first and last part of last season that somehow carried an underwhelming team to the title in his last year) there has been too much reliance on Wayne Rooney.\n\nNo doubt United miss the Fergie fear factor, but behind closed doors at Old Trafford there is an acknowledgement that Moyes, who could hardly come in and have had a clear out, was in fact left with a defective squad.\n\nA big miss: Robin van Persie has not played since the beginning of December\n\nThat is why \u00a3200million gross has been set aside for new players and why United broke their own record to sign Juan Mata from Chelsea.\n\nThere may be another signing before the window closes next week. Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic and Borussia Monchengladbach's Patrick Herrmann are believed to be two targets that United may try and lure.\n\nWhat is certain is that there will be a revolving door at Old Trafford next summer with the old guard of Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and perhaps Wayne Rooney all likely to go - as well as some of the underachieving younger generation.\n\nAnd as it stands it looks likely that Moyes will be given the backing to embark on the biggest rebuild of the squad since the early days of Ferguson.\n\nNot least because Ferguson will argue that if the squad needs a big change it's vital to maintain stability at the top.\n\nFresh faces: Moyes has targeted bringing in Mario Mandzukic (left) and Patrick Hermann from the Bundesliga\n\nIndeed pointing out the trigger-happy treatment of managers by boards at many other clubs when asked about the Moyes situation, Ferguson stressed: 'I can never understand that. The boards must discuss the qualities of the manager they are going to offer the job to, you must look at his CV, his character, the philosophy he has.\n\n'Now, if that is the way they have gone about giving the man the job, why don't they persevere with it? So then maybe it goes for a year, then they change, and then they go through the same procedure again. It seems to me so stupid.'\n\nY-Factor\n\nAfter the Nicolas Anelka case is concluded why don't the FA set out guidelines that any goal salute which carries a political message of any sort should be punished with a 10-game ban.\n\nThat would soon stop players abusing the platform of the pitch for any political ends. These stars have big enough profiles off the pitch to make their feelings on matters outside the game known.\n\niBet\n\nIn his support of Moyes, Ferguson has said he still thinks Manchester United can win the title.\n\nFor man who knows a thing or two about gambling as well as winning titles then the fact that Coral currently offer 66-1 on United retaining their title shows they have no chance.\n\nI would suggest the safest bet is for them NOT to make the top four, which is 3-10.\n\nBut if you think Mata's arrival will inspire a late season surge to take United back into the top four then now is the time to back them at 11-5.\n\nFOTB\n\nArsene Wenger never ceases to amaze.\n\nFor most of the time he is one of the most erudite, astute and affable managers you could possibly wish to come across.\n\nThen suddenly he throws his toys out of the pram and spouts like a spoiled brat.\n\nFor him to bleat that Chelsea selling Juan Mata to Manchester United is 'unfair' is just plain silly.\n\nFOTB Arsene!\n\nIf he were to argue against the idea of a January transfer window as whole he might have a point. But as if he would not take advantage of buying a player before it closes to boost Arsenal's title hopes.\n\nThat is if Wenger, a perennial procrastinator during the January window, can make up his mind in time.\n\nBTW\n\nIf you are still wondering which manager Jose Mourinho had in mind when he mocked them for crying during a press conference which bordered on a Rory Bremner show have a look at these two videos.\n\nOne is of Mourinho and one of comedian Darren Farley impersonating Brendan Rodgers.\n\nDid you spot any similarities?", "'I don't know if he will be able to come out': Mourinho admits 20-day Sanchez absence from US tour would be 'really bad' for Manchester United Arsenal fly in for Draxler and are confident of securing \u00a337m deal for Schalke star\n\nBy Sami Mokbel for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 08:41 EDT, 29 January 2014 | Updated: 20:18 EDT, 29 January 2014\n\nArsenal were rushing to complete a \u00a337million swoop for Schalke sensation Julian Draxler on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Gunners are increasingly confident that a deal to sign the 20-year-old will be completed before Friday night's transfer deadline.\n\nSportsmail first revealed Arsenal's pursuit of Draxler earlier this month, with manager Arsene Wenger believing the Germany forward can be moulded into the next Robin van Persie or Thierry Henry.\n\nVIDEO: Scroll down to see Draxler's impeccable ball control\n\nTarget: Arsenal are closing in on a deal for \u00a337million-rated Schalke forward Julian Draxler (centre)\n\nArsenal chiefs have flown to Gelsenkirchen in an attempt to push through the move. Negotiations will continue through Thursday, but there is a strong feeling a deal will be concluded.\n\nSchalke are refusing to budge on their \u00a337m valuation. Arsenal have been reluctant to go above \u00a330m but fears of missing out on a player Wenger desperately wants have forced them to ramp up their efforts. The attacking midfielder is nursing an ankle injury but should be fit by the end of February.\n\nWenger is also keen on taking young Spaniards Cristian Tello and Alvaro Morata on loan.\n\nArsenal have enquired about Barcelona's Tello and have made fresh contact with Real Madrid regarding Morata.\n\nAaron Ramsey could be out for a month, with the thigh injury that has kept him out since Boxing Day causing him discomfort in training on Monday.\n\nJack Wilshere is also set to miss Sunday's game against Crystal Palace with an ankle problem, while Mathieu Flamini is banned after his red card against Southampton. Arsenal hope Tomas Rosicky will be fit after recovering from illness and a broken nose.\n\nMain man: Draxler is expected to be converted to a striker by Arsene Wenger as he did with Thierry Henry\n\nTarget: Arsenal have made fresh contact with Real Madrid regarding young striker Alvaro Morata\n\nMeanwhile, Wenger is sure to be frustrated after Arsenal's FA Cup fifth-round clash against Liverpool was scheduled for Sunday, February 16. The club wanted to play it the day before, to give the team time to recover for their Champions League clash against Bayern Munich on the Wednesday. But the Saturday lunchtime slot has gone to Manchester City v Chelsea.\n\nThis week, Wenger and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho argued over whether Arsenal get an easy ride over fixtures. Mourinho said the Emirates club have an 'influence', something Wenger was quick to refute, citing his side's hectic schedule before Christmas.\n\nNow they face two huge games in quick succession against Liverpool and Bayern, who play on the Saturday, 24 hours before Arsenal.\n\nCan Wenger turn wunderkind Draxler into another Van Persie?\n\nWho is Arsenal's new wunderkind?\n\nJulian Draxler, one of the hottest talents in Europe. He made his debut for Schalke aged 17 and, even though he's only 20, has already played 133 times for the club. He has won 10 Germany caps and scored once, against the USA.\n\nWenger seems to be favouring Germans.\n\nDraxler would be the fifth in the squad. A product of the national football revolution, it will be money well spent if he has the impact of \u00a342m man Mesut Ozil.\n\nWhat's so good about him?\n\nHe's 6ft 2in but one of the Bundesliga's best dribblers and goes at defenders. He has two good feet, so is comfortable cutting inside.\n\nBut do Arsenal need more midfielders?\n\nWenger may try to turn Draxler into the new Robin van Persie.

Ideally Madrid want to lure Luis Suarez from Liverpool in the summer.\n\nHowever, the new deal Suarez signed with Liverpool recently means his release clause puts his fee in the 100m euro mark.\n\nAnd even Madrid are having to tighten their belts to at least appear as though they are playing ball with FIFA's new financial fair play rules.\n\nBesides, if Liverpool do qualify for the Champions League Suarez himself could well feel more at ease in honouring his \u00a3200,000-plus-a-week deal with the Reds.\n\nPriority: Liverpool hotshot Luis Suarez is Real Madrid's No 1 summer target\n\nFOTB\n\nBrendan Rodgers has done a 'terrific job' thus far this season in moving Liverpool onto a new level.\n\nThey have become title contenders, let alone Champions League candidates, at last and it's been achieved with an alluring brand of football.\n\nRodgers must take much credit for how the team has evolved under his guidance, not least how he handled the Luis Suarez saga and got the very best out of the player since.\n\nHis tactical flexibility and man-management show that like the best bosses he is not too proud or arrogant not to have learned from mistakes.\n\nFor his and Liverpool's sake let's just hope Rodgers keeps his feet on the ground and doesn't start to get too pleased with himself just yet - at least until there is some solid silverware back in the Anfield trophy room and something to be a bit smug about.\n\nOn that front then it is to be hoped he backs away from some Mourinho-like esoteric excesses when holding court to the media as when he spoke of Liverpool and the title race in terms of his team being like 'chihuahuas that run in between the legs of horses'.\n\nFoot on the ball, Brendan. That sounded a bit, er, barking.\n\nBig money: Real may have to pay 100m euro to lure the striker to the Bernabeu\n\nMalky Mackay will top Norwich City's shortlist if they decide to part company with Chris Hughton.\n\nHughton's position has come under increasing strain with Norwich still in the spiders web that is the relegation battle this season.\n\nIt is understood that Hughton has enjoyed a stay of execution at least once this season but his position is under scrutiny again.\n\nWanted man: Malky Mackay will top Norwich City's shortlist if they decide to part company with Chris Hughton\n\niBet\n\nBayern Munich are 9/4 favourites to retain the Champions League.\n\nThe bookies are therefore confident the Germans will roll over Arsenal.\n\nBut it would be foolish to write off the Gunners, so a massive 40-1 for Arsenal to win the Champions League is surely worth a fiver punt.\n\nAnd while Barcelona face a fascinating test against Man City (12-1 to win old big ears), it's not often in recent years the Catalan giants are quoted at 5-1 going into the knockout stage.\n\nChelsea are 12-1 to win, Man Utd 14-1.\n\nOdds courtesy of Coral.\n\nSuch is the desperation down at the bottom, which actually still involves 11 teams, that a new school of thought amongst many boards is that the adrenaline rush of a new manager could be enough to save a team rather than continuity and toughing it out.\n\nThat is why Hughton, now beginning to suffer dissenting voices from the stands, could be the next top flight boss for the chop.\n\nTwo weeks ago Football Grapevine spelled out the fact that Michael Laudrup was in trouble at Swansea - and he was sacked a few days later.\n\nMackay of course has already suffered that fate with Cardiff and is still in dispute with the south Wales club, although he is widely considered to have been hard done by.\n\nHaving played over 200 games for Norwich, he is a popular figure in Norfolk and could be seen at the catalyst to lift them to safety.\n\nPopular: Mackay made more than 200 appearances for the Canaries\n\nDaniel Sturridge is set to be offered the chance to claim his place as England's first choice striker at the World Cup finals in the friendly against Denmark.\n\nSturridge's thrilling form and goals for Liverpool this season have forced him to the forefront of Roy Hodgson's thinking ahead of Manchester United's Danny Welbeck.\n\nStake a claim: Daniel Sturridge will be given the chance to become England's first choice striker at the World Cup\n\nTrial: England boss Roy Hodgson will play Sturridge in the friendly against Denmark\n\nHodgson is hoping Sturridge can forge a similar partnership with Wayne Rooney for England as the one that has evolved with Luis Suarez at Liverpool.\n\nSturridge's Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson is also in the eyes of Hodgson after hitting peak form at the right time.\n\nHenderson is in the sort of form that will see him put Jack Wilshere's place under pressure.\n\nAnd ahead of the FA Cup clash between Arsenal and Liverpool, Wilshere admits: 'Liverpool are the best team we have played all season.'\n\nGame: Spurs boss Tim Sherwood is playing hard ball with his chairman Daniel Levy\n\nBTW\n\nManchester United are out of the title race and unless they win the Champions League - a pipe dream at the moment - qualifying for the competition next season looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nWhich begs the question... if, come the final few weeks of the campaign clinching a top four place is beyond them, do United pull up early and make sure they don't qualify for the Europa League?\n\nQuite apart from the embarrassment of it all, would United really want get embroiled in a competition next season that would have little limited financial or glory benefit but could hamper the main aim of getting back on track in the Premier League?\n\nShould they qualify for Thursday night football could they then run the risk of the UEFA's wrath by treating the tournament as one to blood their younger players?\n\nOr would they even consider turning down the invitation to participate? Now that would could cause an interesting reaction from UEFA.\n\nIt's a dilemma Sir Alex Ferguson could never have envisaged when he opted to retire and hand over the reins to David Moyes. Nor anybody else for that matter.\n\nTim Sherwood is playing an intriguing game with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.\n\nAlthough Sherwood signed an 18-month deal when his caretaker role was upgraded to permanent manager after taking over from the sacked Andrea Villas-Boas, he knows his position is up for review in the summer.\n\nBut instead of saying all the right things, Sherwood is laying down subtle gauntlets with clear messages all the time.\n\nLast week as the club bade farewell to Jermain Defoe, Sherwood stressed he resisted several players Levy and technical director Franco Baldnini had suggested to add to the squad.\n\nSherwood pointed out: 'The aim should not be just to collect players but build something.'\n\nIt was a clear broadside at the club's scattergun policy last summer after selling Gareth Bale, which in the end looked more like an attempt to stockpile assets, with an eye for future sales, rather than build a squad for success.\n\nThat seems how Sherwood sees it and his words and deeds have seen Spurs boost their chances of Champions League qualification.\n\nIn many ways he is just what Tottenham need. A modern, forward-thinking young manager with old school values of team building.\n\nBut if things don't work out, Sherwood's assertive authority will have impressed several other clubs who may be looking for a change of direction come the summer.\n\nBroadside: Sherwood appeared to criticise Levy's transfer policy\n\nAs predicted here four months ago Ashley Cole's place in the World Cup squad is under threat.\n\nIndeed, if Cole isn't named in the England squad this Thursday for the friendly against Denmark at the start of next month it could be all over for the Chelsea left back, who has 106 caps.\n\nEverton's Leighton Baines has emerged as first-choice left back under Roy Hodgson.\n\nUnder threat: Ashley Cole's World Cup is under threat as he is failing to get into the Chelsea team\n\nAnd Hodgson could well see the time is right to blood Southampton's Luke Shaw into the squad.\n\nShaw is a prime Chelsea target in the summer when Cole's contract expires.\n\nCole could have several options in the MSL, but if he feels he has a point to prove in the Premier League, then I hear a move to Liverpool is a definite possibility.\n\nWaiting: Southampton's Luke Shaw (left) and Everton's Leighton Baines are poised to take Cole's place\n\nLeading Premier League managers are set to lobby elite referees to agree to a Tuesday review panel.\n\nTop bosses such as West Ham's Sam Allardyce and Manchester United's David Moyes, under the umbrella of the League Manager's Association, meet with the Professional Game Manager's Officials Board at the start of the March.\n\nOne issue likely to be raised is to introduce a weekly review panel to rule on disputed red cards where there is case for cards to rescinded.\n\nReview: Premier League managers are set to lobby elite referees to agree to a Tuesday review panel\n\nOr where there are cases of off the ball incidents where retrospective red cards should be imposed.\n\nThere is growing disquiet at the current ad hoc system, especially since different people on the panels see different interpretations.\n\nIt is known Allardyce is still angry that Andy Carroll's red card for a borderline clash with Swansea's Chico Flores was not overturned and will cite other reviewed cases.\n\nLiberoiSAY\n\nMonday: Jose Mourinho is 'angry' that Manchester City's Yaya Toure did not get a retrospective red card when his foot made faint contact with Norwich's Ricky van Wolfswinkel. Seems Jose has forgotten Fernando Torres's gauging of Jan Vertonghen and how he got away with it.\n\nTuesday: West Ham make it 10 points out of 12 with a 2-0 win over Norwich. It was their 13th clean sheet of the season, the best in the Premier League which is an amazing stat for a team still embroiled in the relegation battle. Just imagine where they might be had they started the season with a couple more strikers. Plus a bit more flair and ambition.\n\nWednesday: The night after Ronaldo fired Real Madrid to the final of the Copa del Rey with two penalties against Atletico Madrid, Messi scored yet another to see off Real Sociedad and set up an El Clasico final on April 19. The rivalry between between these two colossal clubs just keeps going on.\n\nThursday: Malky Mackay, recently dismissed by Cardiff, is accused of being 'imprudent and careless' over transfers by the club's chief executive Simon Lim. But given Mr Lim must have signed the cheques, the vitriol in the middle of a legal case smacks of an own goal.\n\nFriday: It seems harsh that Rene Meulensteen is sacked after just 75 days but Fulham made the classic error of thinking that a top assistant coach (as the Dutchman had been to Sir Alex Ferguson) has the credentials to cut it as a boss. The gamble now for the relegation-threatened club is that for all his experience, can German Felix Magath hit the ground running in a new country?\n\nRoy Hodgson did the right thing to stand by Joe Hart when the goalkeeper suffered a drastic dip of form in the autumn.\n\nHodgson's loyalty helped Hart through his dodgy spell.\n\nIn recovering from his crisis Hart has reclaimed his place in the Manchester City side, and his form, which makes him - when on song - comfortably England's best goalkeeper.\n\nIndeed Hart's wobble put into sharp focus that even when he went through that blip he is still head and shoulders above his rivals.\n\nFormer England No 1 Peter Shilton suggested that Fraser Forster needs to leave Celtic and play at a more competitive level to really stake a claim.\n\nBen Foster has made himself available again but doubts remain if he is international class.\n\nDitto John Ruddy at Norwich. Jack Butland can't get a game at Stoke.\n\nAn over-reliance on continental keepers is an obvious problem for various reasons, often financial.\n\nBut the FA should also take a long look at the coaching and development of English keepers.\n\nPerhaps with a bit of hard and focused work England's No 1s could grasp the nettle.\n\nThat certainly is the view of former Bolton, West Brom and Bury goalkeeping coach Freddie Barber.\n\nI bumped into Barber last week and he offered some fascinating insights into his coaching techniques and scouting methods that have helped transform the careers of keepers such as Jussi Jaaskelainen and Ali Al-Habsi.\n\nCurrently running soccer schools specialising in goalkeepers it seems strange the FA are reluctant to embrace Barber's schools around the country.\n\nStand by your man: Hodgson stood by Joe Hart when he suffered a dip in form earlier this season\n\nHe's back: Ben Foster is back in the England squad because of a dearth of quality\n\nTo some he might be a maverick, given that in his days at Walsall and Peterborough he didn't just play with a smile on his face but before kick off a fun mask.\n\nBut behind that maverick mask is one of the most interesting and innovative goalkeeping coaches I have ever come across.\n\nHe would certainly be an addition to Hodgson's entourage and when it comes to keepers help get to the heart of the matter.\n\nBack heel\n\nSir Tom Finney, who died on Friday at the age of 91, had retired from football a couple of years before I was born.\n\nBut his name, like that of Sir Stanley Matthews, Billy Wright, Jackie Milburn and Len Shackleton, was still spoken of in revered terms by the older generation.\n\nLike my father, they viewed some of the new-style stars of the Sixties such as Bobby Charlton, George Best and Bobby Moore with some circumspection and a suspicion that they could not quite match up to that Golden Age of players in the Fifties who had helped lift the country out the dark days of the Second World War... at least on the home front.\n\nGreat: Former Preston and England winger Sir Tom Finney (left) died on Friday\n\nMemorial: Tributes to Finney outside Deepdale when Preston played Leyton Orient\n\nOne club man: Finney (right), with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell, walk in front of his likeness at Deepdale\n\nThat's how it goes from father to son in a football household when even if the game is viewed beyond club colours rose-tinted spectacles can often be worn.\n\nBut clearly Finney was one of those players who could have played in any era.\n\nWhat always resonates is that while wizard winger Matthews was the glamour star of that sepia-tinted era, my old man always argued that Finney was better because he could play on either flank or at inside forward if needed. He also scored more goals with an impressive 30 in 76 England appearances.\n\nBill Shankley, who before managing Liverpool was Finney's boss at Preston, endorsed that appraisal.\n\nShanks once said: 'Tom Finney would have been great in any team, in any match and in any age... even if he had been wearing an overcoat.'\n\nY FACTOR\n\nY is that given the Premier League, Football Association and Championship seem so awash with money, they can hand over millions of pounds in fines and penalties to charities but don't divert this surplus cash to small non-League and junior clubs who currently face being sunk because of the impact of the floods.\n\nFor some clubs whose pitches have been waterlogged for six weeks 20 grand could be enough to bail them out.\n\nAnd even Matthews, who died in 2000, acknowledged: 'To dictate the pace and course of a game, a player has to be blessed with awesome qualities.\n\n'Those who have accomplished it on a regular basis can be counted on the fingers of one hand - Pele, Maradona, Best, Di Stefano, and Tom Finney.'\n\nThat puts Finney the player into context.\n\nAnd Finney the man?\n\nWell, he came from a generation when the word gentlemen was a code of honour and playing the game of football was more about passion than pound notes.\n\nAgainst that of course a man like Finney was denied the financial security his talent deserved after he retired.\n\nBut like so many of his era he was not consumed by bitterness or envy about the modern game when so many players who are not fit to darn Finney's socks are mutli-millionaires before they have started to shave.\n\nIn fact on the one occasion I had the privilege to meet Finney, over breakfast the morning after an England game in the early Nineties, he enthused over the ability of Paul Gascoigne.\n\nAnd he admired David Beckham, not least during a loan spell at Finney's beloved Preston early in his career.\n\nIt is to be hoped Finney is suitably honoured by the FA at the forthcoming friendly against Denmark at Wembley.\n\nAfter all, Finney was according to Tommy Docherty the Lionel Messi of his day.\n\nBetter: Former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty, who played with Finney at Preston, said the winger was better than Lionel Messi\n\nThe Doc said: 'He was the best player I've ever seen, alongside Lionel Messi.\n\n'I watch a lot of Barcelona and when I watch Messi, I close my eyes and can see Tom. I'm serious when I say that Messi is the Tom Finney of today.\n\n'Just like Finney, Messi is always getting fouled, but doesn't complain and just gets up and gets on with the game.'\n\nTom Finney RIP.", "'I don't know if he will be able to come out': Mourinho admits 20-day Sanchez absence from US tour would be 'really bad' for Manchester United Arsenal set to miss out on Draxler with Bayern ready to spend \u00a337m on midfielder (as Schalke hint Wenger didn't even bid!)\n\nBy John Drayton\n\nPublished: 05:45 EDT, 2 February 2014 | Updated: 07:00 EDT, 2 February 2014\n\nSchalke have admitted they turned down a 'decent' bid for Julian Draxler last week, but suggest it wasn't from Arsenal.\n\nThe Gunners were linked with the 20-year-old throughout January, but the German club's director of sport Horst Heldt has hinted an offer wasn't forthcoming from north London.\n\nThe asking price was \u00a337million - an amount Arsene Wenger was never likely to sanction for the second time in six months following the capture of Mesut Ozil.\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to watch Julian Draxler show off his technical skill\n\nElsewhere: Schalke admit to rejecting a bid for Julian Draxler but have hinted it didn't come from Arsenal\n\nNo rush?

Stephan El Shaarawy (Milan)\n\nIt's been a write-off season for the Milan striker after a foot injury ruled him out of all but five of their Serie A fixtures but he remains one of the most highly-rated young players in Europe.\n\nThe fact that his absence coincided with a sharp dip in Milan's fortunes under Clarence Seedorf only underlines the 21-year-old's importance.\n\nHe was excellent the season before, scoring 16 goals in 37 Serie A appearances and we're sure it won't be long before the kid known as 'The Pharaoh' is ruling opposition penalty boxes again.\n\nWho's watching: Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid are among the admirers, as are Napoli and Torino, but \u00a325m is the starting price.\n\nThe Pharaoh: Even at 21 years old Stephan El Shaarawy is a key figure in AC Milan's fortunes\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n19. Paulo Dybala (Palermo)\n\nPalermo have walked Serie B this season to make a triumphant return to the top flight and the Argentine striker has played a full part.\n\nManchester City were chasing him a few years ago, perhaps because many say his finishing is reminiscent of Sergio Aguero, but he stayed to help Palermo back into the big time.\n\nThey'll struggle to keep hold of the 19-year-old for much longer if he continues in the same vein.\n\nWho's watching: Barcelona, Juventus, Inter Milan and City have all monitored his progress since he was a teenager in Argentina. Rated at \u00a312m.\n\nGoalscorer: Palermo's Argentinean striker Paulo Dybala has been likened to Sergio Aguero\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n18. Ali Adnan (Rizespor)\n\nAdnan has been christened the 'Iraqi Gareth Bale', which is certainly an interesting nickname.\n\nHailing from Iraq's capital Baghdad, Ali Adnan Kadhim Nassir Al-Tameemi (to give him his full name) is a rapid left back who plays for Rizespor in the Turkish Super League.\n\nThe Asian Player of the Year is being monitored by plenty of big clubs across Europe but has so far been content to play for a more modest outfit and build his reputation.\n\nWho's watching: Arsenal, Liverpool, Sevilla, Borussia Dortmund and Galatasaray all recognise Adnan's potential and that adds to his value of \u00a38m.\n\nBig reputation: Ali Adnan (left) is a rapid left-back who has been dubbed the 'Iraqi Gareth Bale'\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n17. Alvaro Vadillo (Real Betis)\n\nWith Real Betis heading down to the second division, their star asset Vadillo is sure to be spirited away at some point this summer and potentially to the Premier League.\n\nVadillo was the youngest ever player to start a La Liga match back in 2011 at the age of 16 years and 11 months and his blistering pace on the left wing has been troubling defences ever since.\n\nIf he can make his crossing more effective, Vadillo will be quite a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWho's watching: Tottenham and Arsenal have made enquiries. Real Madrid, Liverpool, West Brom and Malaga also like a player who could go for as little as \u00a36m initially.\n\nFlying force: Since making his Real Betis debut aged 16, winger Alvaro Vadillo has been troubling defences\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n16. Zakaria Bakkali (PSV)\n\nIf reports are to be believed that he turned down a new contract at PSV, Bakkali could be coming to a Premier League ground near you soon.\n\nThe 18-year-old winger already has plenty of games under his belt in Holland and has been capped by Belgium at the end of the World Cup qualification campaign.\n\nA stunning hat-trick against NEC in the second round of Eredivisie fixtures this season showed precisely what Bakkali is capable of.\n\nWho's watching: Liverpool and Arsenal have been regular observers among half of Europe's elite. His contract talks are at an impasse and bids are expected in coming days.\n\nOn the move: Winger Zakaria Bakkali could be set to leave PSV after reportedly turning down a new contract\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n15. Mattia De Sciglio (Milan)\n\nMilan's first-choice right back at just 21, De Sciglio performs both his defensive and offensive duties with class.\n\nHis season has been affected by a couple of injury set-backs but he is consistently in the team when fit and available, and will likely be going to the World Cup as he tries to add to his nine Italy caps.\n\nDe Sciglio is far from the finished article - his crossing being one area where work is required - but he has plenty of time to develop.\n\nWho's watching: Manchester United and Real Madrid have admired De Sciglio, as have Arsenal, but Milan would struggle to justify a sale below \u00a318m.\n\nProgress: Right back Mattia De Sciglio is developing fast at AC Milan and could go to the World Cup with Italy\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n14. Kurt Zouma (St Etienne)\n\nZouma just about qualifies for our European list for this season, but he will very much be a Chelsea man come August.\n\nJose Mourinho was so impressed by the 19-year-old's poise and presence in the Saint-Etienne defence, he made a personal call to convince him to move to London.\n\nA \u00a312.5m deal was duly sewn up for the centre half in January and it will be hoped he can be a long-term replacement for John Terry.\n\nWho's watching: Long future at Stamford Bridge ahead of him if he continues to build on his potential. Could quickly become a crowd favourite.\n\nZooming to the top: Teenage defender Kurt Zouma will join Chelsea in the summer and is seen as a long-term replacement for John Terry\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n13. Hakan Calhanoglu (Hamburg)\n\nIt's been an horrendous season for Hamburg as they fought successfully to retain their top-flight status, but a rare bright point has come in the form of 20-year-old Calhanoglu.\n\nHe scored with a brilliantly audacious 45-yard free-kick in the win over Dortmund earlier in the season and his talent has inevitably attracted the attention of leading clubs including Chelsea.\n\nCalhanoglu has drawn comparisons with Mesut Ozil and they share many attributes.\n\nWho's watching: Bayer Leverkusen are hopeful, Hakan wants to play regularly so has dampened the ambitions of Bayern Munich and Chelsea. Will cost \u00a310m.\n\nShining light: Chelsea target Hakan Calhanoglu has drawn comparisons with Mesut Ozil after impressing\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n12. Marquinhos (PSG)\n\nHe won't be going to the World Cup this summer like his central defensive partner Thiago Silva, but Marquinhos can reflect with satisfaction on an excellent first season at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThe two Brazilians complement one another well and the 20-year-old has learned much from the man he calls his 'model and idol'.\n\nNever flustered and with a good command of the penalty box, many other opportunities on the international stage will come for the youngster.\n\nWho's watching: Barcelona are the favourites at this stage with Dani Alves possibly going the other way as part of the overall \u00a340million deal.\n\nSamba star: Marquinhos is learning his trade alongside Brazilian countryman Thiago Silva at PSG\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n11. Viktor Fischer (Ajax)\n\nThere seems to be a never-ending supply of talented midfielders coming through the ranks at Ajax and, just like their previous prodigy Christian Eriksen, Fischer hails from Denmark.\n\nA series of confident performances as Ajax again claimed the Eredivisie once again have the Premier League clubs sitting up and taking an interest.\n\nThe fluidity of their play suits his style, with his dribbling and finishing already better than expected for a 19-year-old.\n\nWho's watching: Usual pattern of progression for Ajax starlets beckons. Would cost \u00a312m with Barcelona, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal interested.\n\nProduction line: Viktor Fischer is the latest name to emerge from Ajax's talented youth academy\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n10. Jese Rodriguez (Real Madrid)\n\nPromoted to the Real Madrid first team squad at the start of the season, Jese had enjoyed a positive debut season until a tear to his anterior cruciate ligament brought it to a premature conclusion in March.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has deployed the 21-year-old on both wings and as an out-and-out forward and he has contributed eight goals and six assists.\n\nIf Karim Benzema departs this summer, perhaps Jese can look forward to further opportunities to prove his undoubted goalscoring potential.\n\nWho's watching: May be allowed out on loan to develop fitness but is well thought of by Madrid, who will rebuff any bids despite interest from Napoli.\n\nVersatile: Used on both wings and as an out-and-out forward, Jese Rodriguez has scored eight goals for Real\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n9. Marco Verratti (PSG)\n\nVerratti has been a regular in the PSG midfield for two seasons now, which isn't bad going for a 21-year-old.\n\nThe Italian put his razor-sharp passing to good effect as the Parisians claimed a second Ligue 1 title in succession and his performances were enough to persuade Cesare Prandelli to include him in his provisional World Cup squad.\n\nWho's watching: Juventus would like Verratti back in Italy but Roma could be the surprise bidders. Chelsea and Arsenal like him, bidding would begin at \u00a322m.\n\nExperience beyond his years: Italy midfielder Marco Verratti has already won two Ligue 1 titles at PSG\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n8. Julian Draxler (Schalke)\n\nAn injury-interrupted season has not diminished Draxler's golden reputation around Europe.\n\nThe Schalke attacking midfielder has been linked with pretty much every leading club, including Arsenal, who seemed poised to bid before backing down.\n\nBut it seems a matter of time before someone stumps up the cash - maybe as much as \u00a335m - for the creative and versatile star.\n\nWho's watching: Arsenal, Manchester City, United, Liverpool and Chelsea plus Bayern Munich. Draxler's options are plentiful but he seems likely to stay one more year.\n\nIn demand: Schalke and Germany attacker Julian Draxler caught the eye of Arsenal with impressive displays\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n7. Florian Thauvin (Marseille)\n\nThauvin didn't make himself too popular when he demanded to move from Lille to Marseille last summer but the 21-year-old winger has remained unfazed and started to repaid his \u00a313m transfer fee.\n\nHis magnetic touch and acceleration have made him a force to be reckoned with and he has scored 10 times and contributed six assists for Marseille this season.\n\nHe has already been compared to Franck Ribery, which means he must be doing something right.\n\nWho's watching: Chelsea, Newcastle and Arsenal have been constant visitors to Marseille while PSG have an interest. His consistency levels may mean he stays until next summer.\n\nWing wonder: Marseille's young French winger Florian Thauvin has been compared to Franck Ribery\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n6. Ricardo Rodriguez (Wolfsburg)\n\nThe Swiss left back certainly isn't shy in bombing forward down the flank, as shown by the seven goals and 10 assists he has provided for Wolfsburg this season.\n\nHis first goal for the Bundesliga club was a free-kick against Borussia Dortmund back in November and the 21-year-old has played every single minute of their league campaign and performed consistently well.\n\nRodriguez's reward was a place in Ottmar Hitzfeld's Switzerland squad for the World Cup.\n\nWho's watching: All the big clubs are looking for left backs and Rodriguez is on every list, albeit not at the top. World Cup may prompt offers. Would cost around \u00a315million.\n\nConsistent: Attacking full-back Ricardo Rodriguez played every minute of Wolfsburg's Bundesliga campaign\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n5. Lucas Moura (PSG)\n\nYet another pivotal member of the PSG side who is 21 or under, Moura arrived in France from Sao Paulo with a big price tag and a burden of expectation.\n\nHe has laid on 18 assists and scored four goals from his wide station in the PSG midfield and is a creative cog in a winning machine.\n\nHe has featured for Brazil, usually from the bench, but it wasn't enough to persuade Luiz Felipe Scolari to elevate him beyond the standby list for the World Cup.\n\nWho's watching: Showing why Sir Alex Ferguson wanted him. Lucas may be sacrificed as part of PSG's plan to sign Eden Hazard and United and Juventus may bite.\n\nUp and coming: Brazilian forward Lucas Moura is an exciting prospect for PSG and has assisted 18 goals\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n4. Raphael Varane (Real Madrid)\n\nHailed by Jose Mourinho no less as 'the best young defender in the world,' Varane has been hampered by injury this season but his talent is beyond doubt.\n\nHis command and composure belies his 21 years and Real have not been afraid to throw him in to important games both at home and abroad, including the Champions League final.\n\nDeschamps was also impressed and included Varane in his 23-man squad for the World Cup finals, where solid performances will only make his stock rise higher.\n\nWho's watching: All Europe's elite clubs wants Varane but Real won't sell. United have asked, as have Chelsea and Manchester City. A favourite of Zinedine Zidane.\n\nBreaking through: Raphael Varane started for Real Madrid as they won a tenth Champions League title\n\nWinner: Raphael Varane celebrates during Real Madrid's Champions League final victory at the weekend\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n3. Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich)\n\nAfter their Champions League humiliation against Real Madrid, some suggested Bayern Munich had regressed this season but the same can't be said about Gotze.\n\nWith 15 goals and 13 assists during his first season after moving from Dortmund, the 21-year-old has already paid back a fair chunk of his \u00a332.5m transfer fee.\n\nHe is one of the outstanding footballers of his generation and there's so many more years ahead of him.\n\nWho's watching: The danger for Bayern is that Gotze is frustrated at not playing every week. Summer sales may appease him but keeping the peace could prove a test of Pep Guardiola's man-management skills.\n\nSuper Mario: Gotze moved to Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund for a huge fee but has continued to shine\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n2. Thibaut Courtois (Atletico Madrid)\n\nWithout doubt the best goalkeeper of his age group in Europe, Courtois has been an absolute rock for Atletico as they chase long overdue glory in both La Liga and the Champions League.\n\nSome of the reaction saves the Belgian has pulled off this season have been out of this world and there now seems little doubt that Chelsea will call time on his loan spell in the Spanish capital and take him all for themselves.\n\nWho's watching: Who wouldn't want him? Chelsea and Courtois should be a long-term marriage.\n\nLoan ranger: Thibaut Courtois has impressed in three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid from Chelsea\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n1. Paul Pogba (Juventus)\n\nAs Manchester United search frantically for quick fixes to their squad this summer, they will surely cast a rueful glance towards Turin.\n\nPaul Pogba has been imperious as Juventus claimed a third successive Serie A title this season and his commanding presence in midfield is exactly what United have been missing.\n\nThey perhaps should have persevered when Pogba started demanding more playing time back in 2012, rather than ushering out the exit door because their loss has most certainly been Juve's gain.\n\nCalled up by Didier Deschamps for France's World Cup squad, the 21-year-old's value - already estimated at \u00a340m - will just continue to rise with impressive performances out in Brazil.\n\nWho's watching: Firstly, you'll need money, around \u00a340m, and that won't deter Real Madrid, PSG, City and Chelsea from asking. The question is whether Juve sell or Pogba's agent Mino Raiola forces a move.\n\nCool finish: Juventus' Paul Pogba celebrates scoring for France in the 4-0 World Cup warm-up win over Norway\n\nTalent: Pogba is already valued at around \u00a340million and a successful tournament in Brazil could boost that", "Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the summer transfer window where we'll keep you up to date with all the latest comings and goings from the Premier League and around Europe.\n\nThe transfer action is set to continue today with Juventus likely to conclude a deal for Napoli and Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain.\n\nElsewhere, the future of Leicester City midfielder N'Golo Kante remains unresolved with the Foxes saying his future lies in his own hands amid strong interest from Antonio Conte's Chelsea.\n\nStay up to date with Sportsmail on all the latest here throughout the day...\n\nAndy Warren\n\nHost commentator\n\nAuto-update 17:13 That's a wrap\n\nThat's it today then for our live transfer blog here at Sportsmail.\n\nWe'll be back again first thing on Monday morning to do it all over again but for now, it's goodbye.\n\n17:10 Never go back? Gotze's heading for a Dortmund reunion\n\nBayern fans made their thoughts on a possible Dortmund return for Mario Gotze very clear, when they unveiled a banner which read 'Milan or Madrid. Just not Dortmund. P*** off Gotze'\n\nThe creative midfielder has seemingly ignored their request.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been told he is surplus to requirements at the German giants and is now preparing to return to his former stomping ground.\n\nGotze has fallen down the pecking order at Bayern during his time at the club and new manager Carlo Ancelotti has not been able to guarantee him a regular first-team spot.\n\nREAD THE FULL STORY HERE\n\nMario Gotze is returning to Dortmund 17:04 Juventus loan Bayern defender Benatia\n\nThe already watertight Juventus defence has been given another boost with the signing of Mehdi Benatia from Bayern Munich.\n\nThe Old Lady have taken the Morocco international on loan for a season, at a cost of \u00a32.5million, and have the option to make the deal permanent next summer for a fee of \u00a314million.\n\nUFFICIALE - @MedhiBenatia \u00e8 bianconero! https://t.co/sxaKxXNGLG pic.twitter.com/9sYrJsUJ7L -- JuventusFC (@juventusfc)\n\nJuly 15, 2016\n\n16:57 Giaccherini nears Napoli move\n\nEmanuele Giaccherini is closing in on a move to Napoli from Premier League side Sunderland.\n\nThe Italian was in Rome to complete a medical on Friday, according to Gazzetta, with a fee of \u00a31.6million agreed after he spent last season on loan at Bologna.\n\nEmanuele Giaccherini is close to leaving Sunderland for Napoli 16:47 Klok fell in love...with Oldham\n\nMidfielder Marc Klok admitted he has fallen in love with Oldham Athletic after signing his short term contract with the club.\n\nHe's a well-travelled player, having started with Utrecht in his native Holland before going on to play for Ross County in Scotland and then Bulgarian club Cherno More.\n\nAnd now he's at Oldham, looking to do enough to earn a longer deal.\n\nKlok (@marcklok10): \"I Fell In Love With Oldham.\" #RobbosBAWA #oafc\n\nRead here: https://t.co/8pIDMHGHGG pic.twitter.com/t4Z5SWnrH4 -- Oldham Athletic AFC (@OfficialOAFC)\n\nJuly 15, 2016\n\n16:16 AC Milan loan highly-rated Moroccan teenager to Zwolle\n\nOne of AC Milan's highly rated teenagers is off out on loan to Holland.\n\nHachim Mastour, who spent last season at Malaga, is now off to Eredivisie side PEC Zwolle on a season-long loan.\n\nBorn in Italy, Mastour represents Morocco at international level and has previously been likened to Wesley Sneijder.

Real Madrid need to find a home for the Costa Rica keeper and can't be seen to dump him on the last day of the transfer window with nowhere to go, especially in view of his performance at the weekend and the Real Madrid supporters' reaction to it.\n\nDe Gea is looking increasingly likely as the hours tick down but it remains to be seen if it's United who take Navas or if he is found a new home elsewhere.\n\nThere are two alternative endings that have emerged in the last couple of hours. One is that Navas accepts being number two to De Gea. He ruled this out at the start of the summer but if he changes his mind the club would then just need to find a new home for Kiko Casilla (who would be third choice behind De Gea and Navas).\n\nAnd a third possibility is that Navas goes elsewhere. Valencia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan injured his right knee at the weekend and has had surgery today ruling him out for the next two months.\n\nValencia do have a surplus of keepers with Joel Rodriguez and Jaume Domenech available now and first choice keeper Diego Alves due back from injury in two months.

United have demanded \u00a333m for the goalkeeper but Madrid believe it is unrealistic for a player whose contract expires in 10 months time and whose relationship with Louis van Gaal is in tatters.\n\nMadrid would like to include Keylor Navas in the deal but the Costa Rican has shown little appetite to join United as of yet.

But it won't be the only offering in the range; Audi has two hot SQ3 and an RS Q3 versions of the small crossover planned. Someone managed to capture the former on film showing off its skills on the N\u00fcrburgring.\n\nThe two-and-a-half minute clip shows the crossover sprinting around the 'Ring wearing its best disguise.

In the rear, the SQ3 hides a set of set of S-specific quad exhaust tips that give off a more-aggressive sound. If you weren't already blasting the speakers, you should be.\n\nWe don't know what's underhood, but no doubt there's an engine more powerful than its standard sibling. Our best guess would be an updated version of VW's turbocharged 2.0-liter with upwards of 300 to 340 horsepower (223 to 253 kilowatts) on tap. The RS Q3, meanwhile, could get as much as 400 hp (298 kW).

Hamed handed himself in to police two days later.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to causing Mr Raynor's death by dangerous driving and was jailed for six years and four months at the Old Bailey.\n\nSentencing, Judge Nicholas Cooke QC said: 'There seems to be at the moment a culture of young males driving powerful cars at excessive speeds.'\n\nHe said the BBC motoring programme, hosted by Matt Le Blanc, should come with a warning - and notices on unacceptable driving 'should be flashed at the start of every episode of Top Gear'.\n\nHe branded Hamed 'a reckless and dangerous fool caught up in the culture', and said that was why he killed someone.\n\nDoing double the 30mph speed limit, Hamed went through a pedestrian crossing at a red light and struck Mr Raynor on Hammersmith Road (pictured), west London, in March last year\n\nHe told the defendant: 'You were just driving at double the speed limit because it felt good to do it.\n\n'The consequence of that is that someone has died. The fact is inescapable that have a bad driving record.\n\n'Had the system operated properly, you would have been disqualified. You failed to stop.\n\n'You must have realised you hit a pedestrian. You drove down back streets, and the removal of the number plates was a panicked stupid attempt to avoid detection\n\n'If I had unfettered discretion, you may be facing rather longer in custody.'\n\nIt emerged that Hamed should not have been on the road when he hit Mr Raynor, as he had been given six points on two separate occasions in 2016.\n\nJudge Cooke said: 'It is regrettable that the bereaved family should have to hear this. This defendant would have been disqualified from driving before the incident.'\n\nHe called it a 'failure of the system, because had he been disqualified he might have been abiding by the disqualification not have been driving on the day in question.\n\n'On behalf of the system, the bereaved family deserve an apology.

He then jumped a red light, hitting Mr Raynor, before fleeing the scene.\n\n'His horrendous actions were then compounded further when he desperately tried to cover his tracks. Despite all of this, Hamed has shown no remorse for taking Mr Raynor's life.\n\n'We are pleased that he has been jailed for a substantial period of time and hope this acts as a warning to other drivers that dangerous irresponsible driving will not be tolerated by the courts.'", "However, critics say the Gigafactory plan has an 'insanely aggressive timeline'\n\nTesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Tuesday landed a deal with Chinese authorities to build a new auto plant in Shanghai, called the Gigafactory 3.\n\nTesla's first factory outside the United States, it would double the size of the electric car maker's global manufacturing.\n\nThe deal was announced as Tesla raised prices on U.S.-made vehicles it sells in China to offset the cost of new tariffs imposed by the Chinese government in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's heavier duties on Chinese goods.\n\nChina is already Tesla's second-biggest market after the U.S., selling about 17,000 cars here last year, compared with roughly 50,000 in the U.S\n\nWHY IS CHINA'S CAR MARKET SO IMPORTANT?\n\nChina is the largest market for electric vehicles, and most forecasters predict that electric vehicle sales in the country will accelerate rapidly as government regulation drives toward a goal of 100-percent electric vehicles by 2030.\n\nMore than 28 million vehicles were sold in China last year, and annual sales are forecast to top 35 million by 2025.\n\nThat would be more than double the current U.S. market, where new light vehicle sales run at about 17 million vehicles a year.\n\nMusk was in Shanghai Tuesday, and the Shanghai government in a statement said it welcomed Tesla's move to invest not only in a new factory in the city, a center of the Chinese auto industry, but in research and development, as well.\n\nChina has long pushed to capture more of the talent and capital invested by global automakers in advanced electric vehicle technology.\n\n'Last year, we announced that we were working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a factory in the region to serve the Chinese market,' Tesla said.\n\n'Today, we've signed a Cooperative Agreement for Tesla to start building Gigafactory 3, a new electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Shanghai.\n\n'We expect construction to begin in the near future after we get all the necessary approvals and permits.\n\n'From there, it will take roughly two years until we start producing vehicles and then another two to three years before the factory is fully ramped up to produce around 500,000 vehicles per year for Chinese customers.'\n\nHowever, critics say the plans could be too ambitious.\n\n'In usual Tesla fashion, they are coming out with an insanely aggressive timeline of having vehicles in production at this factory in only two years from the deal being signed,' Electrek said.\n\nA woman sits in a Tesla Model 3 car during a media preview at the Auto China 2018 motor show in Beijing\n\nThat would make Tesla's Shanghai plant large by auto industry standards, where most factories are tooled to build 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles a year, and roughly equivalent to the planned annual production at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California.\n\nTesla shares rose 1.5 percent in U.S. trading even as some analysts questioned where the money-losing company will get the capital required to build and staff such a large plant.\n\nMusk has said Tesla will be cash-flow positive this year. Analysts have predicted it will raise capital to fund a list of new projects, including launching an electric semi truck, a pickup truck, a compact SUV and new battery and vehicle production facilities that Musk has proposed for China and Europe.\n\n'I am sure that Tesla needs fresh money at the latest next year,' said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB.\n\nThe Shanghai government suggested it could help with some of the capital costs. 'The Shanghai municipal government will fully support the construction of the Tesla factory,' its statement said.\n\nTesla said Tuesday\u00b4s announcement will not impact U.S. manufacturing operations, which continue to grow.\n\nMusk was talking about building a Chinese factory long before the Trump administration proposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nChina until recently levied 25-percent tariffs on imported cars, and for decades automakers have been moving to build more vehicles in the markets where they are sold to neutralize currency shifts and trade policy reversals.\n\nChinese authorities' decision to grant Tesla permission to move forward lands as President Trump is fighting to stop U.S. manufacturers from responding to his trade policy by shifting production overseas, as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc said it would do last month.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of trade conflict with Washington, China is using its power to draw investment from the global auto industry. German automakers on Monday and Tuesday dominated a list of deals between China and Germany focused on the development of electric vehicles and technology for connectivity and self-driving cars.\n\nBMW agreed with partner Brilliance Automotive Group Holdings to up production capacity at joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive to 520,000 BMW brand vehicles in 2019.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk leaves the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, China July 10. Musk was in Shanghai , and the Shanghai government in a statement said it welcomed Tesla's move to invest not only in a new factory in the city, a center of the Chinese auto industry, but in research and development, as well.\n\nCapacity at BMW Brilliance Automotive's (BBA) two production sites will outstrip BMW's U.S. plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, for the first time. BMW said last week it would be unable to fully absorb a new Chinese 25-percent tariff on imported U.S.-made models and would have to raise prices on the vehicles it makes in Spartanburg.\n\nVolkswagen, meanwhile, said it will cooperate with China's FAW Group on technologies including e-mobility, connectivity and autonomous cars.\n\nTesla has been in protracted negotiations to open its own factory in China to help bolster its position in the country's fast-growing market for electric cars and to avoid high import tariffs.\n\nTesla hiked prices in China over the weekend to a level more than 70 percent higher than in the United States amid mounting trade frictions between Washington and Beijing that have seen several U.S. imports, including cars, subjected to retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent.\n\nMusk had previously criticized China's tough auto rules for foreign businesses, which would have required it to cede a 50-percent share in the factory.\n\nAfter China announced in May that it planned to scrap by 2022 the rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle ventures, Tesla registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai.\n\n'The Shanghai plant will certainly improve Tesla\u00b4s positioning in China and allow it to locally produce and avoid import tariffs. The relaxation of the 50/50 rule for JVs in China uniquely benefits Tesla because they did not have an existing JV in China' as rivals do, said Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest.", "I am easily a foot taller than Andy Grove. But whenever I was with him, I felt that he was the giant.\n\nThat's what the bestselling Harvard business professor, Clayton Christensen, wrote about the former Intel chief executive when he passed away in 2017. Christensen, who coined the term \"disruptive technology\", said he would most miss Grove's ability to understand how a complex organisation works, and to wield it to Intel's advantage.\n\nIt allowed Grove, who started at the company the day it was incorporated on July 18, 1968, to famously re-orient the business in the 1980s. Intel shifted away from memory chips for mainframe computers towards the microprocessor - the engine that spurs into motion when you turn on your computer.\n\nPropelled by a deal with IBM to put Intel processors into all its personal computers, the company came to provide Silicon Valley with one of its most essential technologies. Intel Inside and the accompanying jingle became one of the most memorable advertising slogans of the modern era.\n\nEven after five decades of dominance, no other company in the world can produce a better and faster microprocessor. Intel is at the pinnacle of an industry that manages to engineer miracles like no other. We tend to perceive innovation as something uncertain, particularly where it's so reliant on scientists to drive it forward. Yet Intel is anything but ambiguous. It has released successive advances in processor engineering like clockwork.\n\nIn 1965, future co-founder Gordon Moore made a bold prediction about the exponential growth of computing power. He predicted that the number of microchip transistors etched into a fixed area of a computer microprocessor would double every two years - and so, therefore, would computing power. Intel has since delivered on this improbable promise, immortalising \"Moore's law\".\n\nIt's difficult for anyone to fathom the effects of exponential growth. But it is why a single iPhone today possesses many times more computing power than the entire spacecraft for the NASA Apollo moon mission of 1969. Without Moore's law, there would be no Google, no Facebook, no Uber, no Airbnb. Silicon Valley would be like any other valley.\n\nThe Big Miss\n\nAnd yet, the iPhone is also what Intel missed. Immediately after the company won Apple's Mac business in 2005, Steve Jobs came asking for another chip for his smartphone. Intel certainly wanted to dominate this emerging sector but the price Jobs was offering was below its forecasted cost and it misjudged the size of the iPhone market. The company passed.\n\nApple had no choice but to build its own chipsets by licensing technologies from ARM, a British-based company controlled by Japanese interests. If Apple and its iPhone had been the only competitors, Intel might have been able to gradually adapt. But Google came in soon after with Android, a free operating system that Samsung, Huawei and HTC all adopted. Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments, all licensed by ARM, became the phone makers' go-to suppliers for energy-efficient, low-cost computing devices.\n\nThese American rivals are not trying to beat Intel. Qualcomm specialises in mobile phones and Nvidia specialises in graphics in video games. They all outsource production to third parties in Asia. But an Intel microprocessor sells for around US$100 while ARM-based chips sell for around US$10, and often less than a dollar. That's how ARM-based designs are now found in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.\n\nIn other words, Intel failed to compete in smartphones against those who have far less resources. It's a great irony when you reflect that Grove once invited Christensen to the Intel HQ in Santa Clara, California, to explain his theory on disruption. Grove later credited the meeting as the main driver for Intel's decision to launch the Celeron chip in 1998, a cheap product aimed at low-end PCs, which within a year captured 35% of the market.\n\nThe New Goldrush\n\nNow the big question is whether Intel is repeating its previous mistake with iPhones - this time in driverless cars. Last March it purchasedMobileye, an Israeli company that makes digital vision technology, for US$15.3 billion. It was a big bet in a sector that has huge potential: as autonomous driving takes off, vehicles are becoming computers on wheels. They will require more and more microchips and Intel hopes to dominate.\n\nExcept for one glitch. Everything Intel has done in the last 50 years is geared towards general purpose, high-end chipsets. Its integrated model - where the company designs and manufactures its processors - means it absorbs an enormous amount of fixed cost, in research and design as well as manufacturing.\n\nThe only way to offset these burdens is to sell a high volume of devices at high margins. The result is that the company is obsessed with technological progress, but has a rigid business model which limits what it can and cannot do. There's a monster inside Intel with a ferocious appetite.\n\nBut what if autonomous driving doesn't actually require the computing power Intel is counting on? This is the competing vision of Huawei. When I recently visited Shenzhen, executives from the Chinese telecom giant explained to me that much of the city's infrastructure will be digitalised and that Huawei will saturate it with a 5G network. This will drastically reduce any speed and latency problems for computers.\n\nThis means the computing inside cars can be mostly offloaded to the city's infrastructure. It is a radical vision, but clearly a viable alternative. The implication is that a BMW or Toyota doesn't need that many high-end chipsets after all. It's smartphones all over again.\n\nChristensen's insight was that successful companies die not because of complacency to change. Kodak, Polaroid, Blockbuster and DEC all understood the shifting landscape.\n\nBut in each case, their business model and the demands of existing shareholders formed an intractable nexus that even the most courageous executives found impossible to navigate. Grove once said, \"only the paranoid survive\". Maybe he was right.\n\nHoward Yu is a Professor of Management and Innovation at IMD Business School\n\nThis article appeared in The Conversation.

But drive on the 750m Sardar Market-Sahara Darwaja stretch and you agonizingly realize that this entire chunk of taxpayers' money has only gone down the drain.\n\nPotholes of every size and shape at every few metre are not only back-breaking, but a proof of how the hard-earned money of citizens is dumped.\n\nThis small stretch is one of the 60 such roads -- forget about the lanes and by-lanes -- which have turned into commuters' nightmare due to extensive damage caused by rains and the patchy work by contractors hired by the Surat Municipal Corporation. And, if you think driving in Ferraris, Mercedes or BMWs will be easier on these roads, you are mistaken.\n\nThis ugly road scenes are spread across the soon-to-be 'Smart City', which recently won accolades for executing projects under this ambitious pan-India project.\n\nAt present, SMC is making stopgap arrangement to fill up the potholes with granular material as and when the rain takes a halt. There are eight such roads in Varachha, six in Athwalines, eight in Udhna, 12 in Limbayat, 12 in Katargam, six in Rander and nine in central zone where patchwork is being done on damaged portions.\n\nAccording to an estimate, since the beginning of monsoon, at least 20 per cent of the total 4,000-odd km road in the city has damaged. The upper surfaces have got peeled off, resulting in potholes.\n\nMunicipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, \"We have seen that maximum damage of roads is at intersections because of heavy influx of vehicles. At other places, there are damages, but it is comparatively less.\"\n\nKharwarnagar junction at Udhna is the glaring example where influx of vehicles is very heavy at any given point of time. Even at Athwa and Rander zones, uneven surfaces at Lakeview Circle and Mora Bhagal junctions are riddled with potholes.\n\nSMC officials chose to blame the condition on heavy downpour in short duration. Executive engineer, SMC, Jatin Desai told TOI, \"When compared to previous years, the intensity of rain this time is high and in a very short duration. This has resulted in damage to the roads where upper bindings have become loose and potholes have been created.\"", "Mercedes-Benz cars wait to be shipped at the harbor in Bremerhaven, nothern Germany, on June 1, 2018.\n\nThe price of a new car could jump by between $1,400 and $7,000 for top-selling models, if the Trump administration moves ahead with tariffs on imported automobiles and auto parts, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nIn a forthcoming analysis, Peterson calculated the price impact on vehicles in three categories: compact cars; compact SUVs and crossovers, and luxury SUVs and crossovers, based on the 2017 bestselling brands. Using 2018 prices, they added 1 percent for aluminum and steel tariffs and another 25 percent tariffs on all foreign content of vehicles.\n\n\"All the cars in the U.S. market have some foreign components,\" said Jeremie Cohen-Setton, Peterson research fellow. Peterson said the average cost of all cars would rise because of that, whether they are imported or made in the U.S.\n\nFor instance, compact cars, such as the Chevy Cruz, Nissan Sentra or Honda Civic, average 51 percent foreign content. The $16,381 base price of a Chevy Cruz could jump by $2,140 if 100 percent of the tariffs were passed through to consumers. A Sentra could jump by $3,075 to about $19,300, based on the fact it has an 80 percent foreign content.\n\nThe biggest cost increases would be on some of the luxury models, which have the most foreign parts or are made abroad. For instance, the base price for a Mercedes-Benz GLC-class, with 100 percent foreign content, would jump from $36,846 to more than $45,400 if the proposed tariffs were passed on in their entirety to consumers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he may slap tariffs of 20 or 25 percent on auto imports, and he has asked the Commerce Department to study whether vehicle imports threaten national security, the same argument the U.S. used to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including the automotive sector, and China has retaliated with its own tariffs. China raised its tariffs on the U.S. automotive sector, and they are now 40 percent on vehicles that are mostly built by BMW, Daimler and Ford. The U.S. has also put tariffs on imported steel.\n\nThere have been signs that European leaders want to head off a trade clash on autos, and they may be willing to negotiate a deal that could cut existing European tariffs on American cars. European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expected to meet with Trump next week. Economists say current tariffs are having minimal impact, but a full-blown trade war in the automotive sector could have far-reaching implications.\n\n\"So far this strategy hasn't produced very positive results,\" said Cohen-Setton. \"That's the exact same kind of strategy that was supposed to work out in steel and aluminum in the negotiations ... and at the end of the day we got the tariffs. That's the track record of this administration. So unless there is a stronger pushback from the car lobby, I think it was an important precedent.\"\n\nThe Peterson study assumes manufacturers will not pass on the full brunt of tariffs to consumers, and it also calculated the increased sticker price using an approximate pass-through of two-thirds of the cost. That means a Ford Escape, with about 40 percent foreign content, would be hit with $2,274 in tariffs, but the current price of $22,300 might rise instead by $1,571 if just a portion of the tariffs were passed through.\n\nA car in the same category, the $22,898 Nissan Rogue, could see full tariffs of $4,393, based on the 80 percent of foreign content it includes, but its price might rise by just $2,970. But the Honda CR-V, priced similarly at $22,198, could see tariffs of just $1,963 because it has only 35 percent foreign content, and at a reduced level, consumers might pay $1,363 more.\n\nIf the tariffs were to go through, a top-selling Lexus NX, now priced at $32,927, could jump to $40,233 if Toyota passed on the full $7,306 in potential tariffs, based on its 95 percent foreign content. But an Acura RDX, with just 35 percent foreign content, would see its sticker price rise to just under $36,500 if the full cost of the tariffs were added to its $33,464 price.\n\nPeterson said it assumed that no countries would be exempted when it calculated tariffs, but it could not include Canada because the available data did not separate American and Canadian automobile content. As a result, the potential effects of tariffs could be underestimated.", "[MILAN] European shares hit a one-month high on Wednesday, supported by currency weakness and a rally in tech stocks following well-received earnings updates and a record close for the Nasdaq.\n\nThe tech index rose 2.5 per cent with Ericsson up 8.5 per cent after the mobile telecom equipment maker unexpectedly swung to a modest operating profit, while semiconductor bellwether ASML jumped 8.1 per cent on forecast-beating results.\n\nTheir gains and a positive assessment of the US economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday drove the pan-European Stoxx 600 benchmark index up for a second day, putting it 0.6 per cent higher by the close.\n\nThe upbeat remarks from Mr Powell, who will continue his testimony to Congress later on Wednesday, lifted the dollar, which in turn helped shares in Europe's export-oriented sectors and Germany's DAX rise.\n\n\"While acknowledged risks and uncertainty stemming from the growing trade tension, he stated that the risks to the outlook were \"roughly balanced\",\" said UniCredit strategists.\n\nAutos stocks, which rely heavily on exports for growth and have been penalised by the United States threatening to introduce higher import tariffs, were among the best performers, up 1.1 per cent at a one-month high.\n\nTraders said the sector was also supported by reports that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will visit US President Donald Trump in Washington on July 25 to discuss strained trade ties.\n\nEuropean automakers send around US$50 billion worth of cars to the United States and Trump has repeatedly threatened to raise tariffs on car imports from Europe.\n\nShares in BMW, the most exposed carmaker with up to one-fifth of its global sales heading to the United States, rose 1 per cent, while Volkswagen climbed 2.2 per cent.\n\nEurope's banks underperformed, dragged down by a drop of 9.1 per cent in Danske Bank shares after the Danish lender said 2018 net profit would be at the low end of its target range.\n\nDenmark's biggest lender also said it would forego profits made from transactions in Estonia subject to a money laundering investigation.\n\nAnother top large-cap gainer was Novartis, which rose 3.2 per cent following its earnings update.

Once the defendant found the terms acceptable, the parties are bond. There is nothing on the other side against which the evidence led by the plaintiff could be evaluated on the imaginary seek as the defendants failed to adduce evidence in support of their pleadings, plaintiff will succeed on minimum proof.

The USA Today Network will also provide live coverage.\n\nMore: Automakers to Trump: Higher tariffs would affect consumers, jobs\n\nFirst up on the agenda will be the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which released a transcript of prepared testimony from their spokeswoman, Jennifer Thomas, on Wednesday.\n\nA 25 percent tariff would raise the price of an imported car nearly $6,000 and the price of a U.S.-built car $2,000, according to the Alliance.\n\n\"This would equate to an $83 billion tax on U.S. consumers that would trigger a domino effect on the industry and economy,\" the group's transcript said. \"When vehicle prices rise, demand drops. Lower demand means less production. And when production declines, job losses follow.\"\n\nUp to 200,000 American auto workers would lose their jobs if a 25 percent tariff were imposed, according to the Alliance, which quoted a Peterson Institute analysis. That number could climb to 600,000 if other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAlso included among speakers Thursday are the United Auto Workers, Volkswagen, Hyundai, representatives of the European Union, Mexico and Canada (among other nations), and multiple auto industry groups in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nPerhaps telling, BMW - a frequent target of Trump's criticism - did not make the agenda, though the German automaker had asked to be on it, according to a company representative.\n\nIn a June 28 letter to Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a BMW representative noted that free trade boosts the American economy and preserves global order and peace.\n\n\"BMW directly and indirectly adds $6.3 billion annually to South Carolina's\n\neconomy and leads to the employment of 36,285 people there,\" the letter noted.\n\nBMW employs more than 10,000 people at its Spartanburg County plant and last year launched a multi-year, $600 million expansion that will increase jobs there to 11,000. The plant is on track to produce more than 400,000 vehicles there this year, of which about 70 percent are exported.\n\nBMW stated in its letter that it opposes the European Union's 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles.\n\n\"They send Mercedes, they send BMWs,\" Trump said of the European Union during a campaign rally last month. \"They send everything, we practically tax them nothing. We can't send our cars and if we do they charge many many times the tax that we stupidly don't charge.\"\n\nTrump went on to say,\"It's all going to work out, because we are the piggy bank that they like to take from.\"", "It's been just a couple of months since BMW unveiled the M2 Competition and the Germans are already looking to set a new world record with the coupe. In a newly launched video called \"A challenge extended is a challenge accepted,\" BMW is teasing a record attempt that takes place in England. Unfortunately, there aren't many hints as to what kind of benchmark this is.\n\nThe video is only 16 seconds long, and the only thing we can gather from it is that this record involves a powerful laser beam. The footage was also shot in a warehouse, which means that the record isn't about the car's fast acceleration and impressive performance, but more about its handling. We can also see a 60-second timer and a BMW engineer saying that \"if the car doesn't respond to the feedback precisely, we're really not going to break this record.\"\n\nWell, at least we know that BMW wants to break a previous record. Given the short, 60-second benchmark, it's probably something with drifting and the ability to complete a short course with tight turns. Either way, it should be a lot of fun to watch. And, hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to find out what record BMW is trying to break.\n\nAs a brief reminder, the M2 Competition replaced the M2 with a slightly sportier exterior and a mildly modified interior. The big news lies under the hood though, where the M2 engine was replaced with the twin-turbo, 3.0-liter inline-six mill from the M4. The unit delivers a whopping 404 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque and pushes the coupe from 0 to 62 mph in only 4.2 seconds.", "Now that major performance brands have introduced electric cars, Lexus' Performance wing may also start buzzing electric. According to President Yoshihiro Sawa, Lexus' F sub-brand could be heading towards electrification, while retaining the petrol engines as well. Are we going to get newer models, or will the existing cars get hybrid souls?\n\nSpeaking to Auto Express at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Sawa said, \"F is very important; with F we have to think of our own original way,\" \"We don't stick to V-8, V-10, twin-turbocharged; they're important, but we're looking at the future. We'd like to find a way to connect to the next era.\"\n\nHe also added, \"I think that now, we're in a transitional period. At this moment people say EVs are trendy but three years later, who knows? People like the sound, the dynamics [of combustion engines]. I think we cannot stick to the one solution when it comes to providing emotion.\"\n\nCurrently, the F marque sells the RC F, GS F, and the LC; all of them using V-8 engines. It is most likely that all these models, along with newer models in the future, will get hybrid powertrains. This doesn't mean the combustion engines will be ruled out anytime soon. While there was no announcement of any sorts, Sawa did mention an F GT car, \"which could be a hybrid with an electric motor and a strong engine, giving a different kind of drive feel.\"\n\nThe electrification era is more or less like a shuffle, where almost everyone starts from the scratch. Lexus has not been able to give stiff competition to any of its rivals for that matter; be it the luxury marque or the performance brand itself. This seems like a good opportunity for Lexus to use this as a launch pad and showcase itself as a worthy contender against the likes of Tesla, Polestar, and BMW - to name a few. In fact, Yoshihiro kept stressing on one thing the whole time - an emotional connection with people. Now, will these hybridized fast cars put Lexus F over the top? Leave your thoughts in the comments section below.", "VW T-Roc Design\n\nRating:\n\nThis was a sign-and-a-half to behold, flashing merrily away last week: 'WARNING, FILMING IN PROGRESS. EXPECT GUNFIRE AND LIVE EXPLOSIVES.'\n\nHappens a lot around where we live. The filming, that is, not so much the gunfire and explosions. Apparently there was a boat chase too. Morgan Freeman pursuing Gerard Butler in something called Angel Has Fallen. Haven't met Mr Freeman but have met Mr Butler. Chewed his ear off once at a party. He couldn't have been more pleasant. I was half-cut, he'd been sober for years. Couldn't have been easy for the poor chap.\n\nOh, hang on a minute, back the truck up, that's Bradley Cooper I'm thinking of. I always get those two mixed up. They are so similar, the superstar equivalent of new SUVs.\n\nThe new VW T-Roc looks absolutely gorgeous, with one of those continental two-tone paint jobs that are very \u00e0 la mode at the moment\n\nAnd here comes yet another one for us to get our heads around. This time a midsize offering from VW. I know SUVs are really important nowadays, but my brain is beginning to melt trying to separate the meaningful and mighty from the mediocre and meaningless.\n\nAll right, deep breath. Throw me a rope, I'm going in...\n\nThe new VW T-Roc looks absolutely gorgeous, with one of those continental two-tone paint jobs that are very \u00e0 la mode at the moment. Such options always come at a premium, of course - in this case, a \u00a3575 option. That said, it's a snip compared with the \u00a33,600 BMW wanted for adding Nardo Grey pizzazz to its M3 last week.\n\nThe cool-sounding T-Roc also has a lightness about it - no mean feat considering it's quite a chubby little pup if you look closely. How have they managed this? My mum could tell you, but she doesn't have a car column, so I'll tell you instead. When she was a young lass, to make her legs look more attractive in beach photos, she used to craftily gather a line of sand up and around herself so she looked even skinnier than she already was. 'It was our version of Photoshopping,' she giggles when anyone asks. And boy does it work. Give it a go this summer.\n\nAnyway, the point is, this is what VW has done with the T-Roc. The (massive) lower sill is the sand and what's above is my mum's legs. Sort of. The net effect being the car looks a lot less top-heavy than it really is. Throw in some big wheels, higher-than-average ground clearance and some tastefully flared wheel arching, and the impression is accentuated even further. A trim, attractive and fun-looking vehicle, then. Well done, VW. Fun is the way forward, as I've been saying for years, especially with SUVs.\n\nOn a similar theme, the marker lights, with bright-white halo surrounds on each side of the front bumper, instantly change to amber when an indicator is selected. Another nice touch from a manufacturer totally focused on grabbing your attention with positive sensory messages from the moment you set eyes on its vehicles.\n\nUp front, the exterior-colour-matched internal panels bring the T-Roc cockpit to life\n\nLuggage capacity is interesting - it's surprisingly ungenerous, yet when one lifts the false floor there appears to be acres of unused available space above the spare wheel. What a waste.\n\nFolding down the back seats is a bit fiddly and laborious, while closing the tailgate will prove a challenge for smaller folk as a hefty old heave downwards from a considerable height is required.\n\nThe rear passenger compartment is effectively only a two-person bench seat, although there is the suggestion that a third occupant might be able to perch on high somewhere in the middle. I tried as much, and felt like I'd been placed on the world's first in-car naughty step. The general message being: ditch the problem child, pull down the centre arm rest and make the most of the cup-holders instead.\n\nUp front, the exterior-colour-matched internal panels bring the T-Roc cockpit to life.

Once on the move, however, there really is nothing much to grumble about. Navigating the six-speed manual gearbox is effortless, and the whole T-Roc experience is extremely easy and light to the touch. Perhaps a little too light when it comes to the steering, but more calming and relaxing than passive and uninteresting.\n\nAnd it's no slouch either, with the highly efficient (and economical) engine producing 148hp, more than enough to T-Roc (apologies) your world. Handling is a bit Swiss - more or less permanently neutral - while braking is medium to firm, how most of us like it. Not too sharp, although the auto emergency-braking system certainly wakes you up when it kicks in (which it did a lot in our drive for some reason).\n\nOnce on the move there really is nothing much to grumble about.

Which must surely also be in VW's long-term plans.\n\nFor now though, I can assure you the T-Roc is destined to be a winner winner chicken dinner. It's bigger and more practical than the Golf, and despite a few low-fi interior-finish issues, I think people from all walks of life will fall for its all-round funky vibe.\n\nThe T-Roc also notched up myriad plaudits from the ultimate cool-ometer, the all-powerful mums on the school run.\n\nWhich means only one thing. An emphatic smash hit.", "Mini 1499 GT\n\nRating:\n\n'Mum, Mum! I went on a steam train for the first time ever,' I declared excitedly last week. 'No you didn't,' she replied. 'Excuse me, but I did,' I reiterated. 'Not true, you've been on a steam train before. We took you to Wales on one when you were two.'\n\nHow did I not know this? Why has she waited until now to tell me? Why tell me at all? Why not just allow me to have my own steam train moment 48 years on?\n\n'In fact, we took you on a steam train five times in all, maybe six.'\n\nWhat? No. Stop. Enough. For years I've been banging on to anyone who'll listen that out of all the amazing things I've been lucky enough to experience, riding on a steam train thus far has not been one of them. I'll continue regardless.\n\nIt's called the 1499 GT as 1,499cc is the engine size and Mini is producing just 1,499 of these little beauties\n\nWhat a spectacularly romantic way to get to Cheltenham on Gold Cup day, a real pinch-me moment. The individual compartments, the netted luggage racks, the clouds of steam. Volunteers like Andy and Ed firing up the mighty Southern Railway Merchant Navy Class P&O locomotive against a scorching backdrop of white-hot coals. Just two of the 200-plus volunteers who keep this steam railway alive, all of whom are currently even more excited than usual at the prospect of an additional three miles of steam heaven coming soon with the reopening of the old station at nearby Broadway.\n\nBroadway, a stunning Cotswold village, home to the legendary 600-year-old Lygon Arms hotel. The very place where Cromwell dined the night before the Battle of Worcester in 1651, and where Richard Burton romanced Elizabeth Taylor in 1963. Prince Philip and various Prime Ministers also feature in the guestbook of this jewel in Britain's crown, where the staff are first-rate, the food and wine is world-class and there's a 'collection' of bars. We intend to return very soon.\n\nNot soon enough, however, for this week's test car. A pity, as the new Mini 1499 GT would really look the part sitting out there on the village green. It's called the 1499 GT as 1,499cc is the engine size and Mini is producing just 1,499 of these little beauties. A smart move.

My first car was a Mini, my first Scalextric was the 1970s Mini Rally Cross edition, yellow with a black-chequered roof - also a collector's item nowadays.

The only wrinkle in what is an otherwise beautifully composed work of art. On the school run, everyone loved it. Boom! As they did on the A30, M25, M4 and in Central London, thumbs-up all the way, all day, my wife included. She loved the honeycomb grilles front and back, the black sports alloys, rear spoiler, the gold GT livery and the blacked-out rear windows. The only thing she wasn't so keen on were the gold Union Jack wing mirrors.\n\nThe red-and-black leather, cloth and Dinamica Recaro sports seats are lush, dynamically sculpted, comfy and supportive. The meaty leather steering wheel, with its multi-function switchgear, matching handbrake and gear knob, is both attractive and gratifying to grab hold of. The arcs and swooshes of piano-black shiny panels combined with chunky leather finishes and Mini's trademark circular dials, speakers, handles and central infotainment screen create a seriously classy groove. As does sitting in the driver's seat behind the aircraft-style wraparound windscreen - an extremely pleasant vantage point from which to view the world. Especially considering all the above comes free as standard, as do other usually optioned extras such as sports suspension, cruise control, John Cooper Works aerodynamics kit and air-conditioning. The only extra cost that came up on the invoice were the velour floor mats at \u00a365. Why, I have no idea.\n\nMy wife loved the honeycomb grilles front and back, the black sports alloys, rear spoiler, the gold GT livery and the blacked-out rear windows\n\nAll good then. All perfect, in fact. Just as long as you don't expect the car to drive quite as well as it looks. Not that it isn't fun. It is. Lots of fun. It handles superbly, the steering is as direct and responsive as any other car on the planet and the engine is more than adequate, especially if you stick to chucking it around the local lanes in second and third all day. Beyond that, however, there is little grunt and growl, barely even a purr. Which is a shame, because this could easily be the most exciting Mini for a decade. That said, it's absolutely fine cruising on the motorway, although I didn't really sense a need for fourth or sixth gear, going mostly from third to fifth and staying there. But I don't think any of this will be a deal-breaker to at least 1,499 people, which is all BMW needs to sell the lot. An eminently sensible business decision then, albeit one that could have been so much more than that. I still liked the car, though, despite no heated seats or driver's armrest (creature comforts much appreciated by today's pampered hatchback fans).\n\nI liked the price, too. It's a car that will hold its value better than most for years to come. With some vintage Mini originals now fetching ten, 20, even 50 times their original list price, I'm saying this is a four-star car but a five-star buy. When it comes to a new take on an old legend, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.", "Jaguar E-Pace R-Dynamic HSE\n\nRating:\n\n(and a half)\n\nI could say of the past seven days - seven months even - that it's been a sad time. But that simply wouldn't be true. My mum, of whom I've talked a lot via these pages (a record for a mum where a car column is concerned, I'd imagine), has finally been relieved of the lot of us, after 92-and-a-half years of putting up with our various needs, wants and whatever else kids end up driving their parents mad with for the rest of their lives.\n\nFor the past two weeks, we've all been squeezed into her little bungalow 24/7. During which time, not a single armchair, sofa or square foot of carpet escaped at least one Evans torso sprawled across it at some point.\n\n'You can all stay, but only on one condition,' she announced when we first arrived. 'You all keep calm and carry on.' I'm paraphrasing a little here, but that was the gist of it.\n\nIt is with Minnie's blessing, therefore - or more accurately, her insistence - that here follows our regular column...\n\nThe Jaguar E-Pace R-Dynamic HSE. 'Dad, this car is fantastic,' screamed Noah, as we gunned down yet another undulating tunnel of tree-lined twists and turns up in the Surrey hills\n\nThe first thing you will be asked if you decide to buy a Jaguar E-Pace is, how electric is it? To which the answer is, it's not electric at all. A response that is more than a little confusing for most people. The name is the red herring. Why call it an E-Pace at all? When nowadays all anyone thinks about when they hear anything to do with the letter E and cars is, where do I plug in the damn thing and how far will it get me before I have to call out the Duracell bunny for roadside assistance? An issue further compounded by the fact that the revolutionary Jaguar I-Pace is due this summer, which is totally electric but also sounds like it might be a BMW (which already has an electric 'i' range in the i3 and i8). The I-Pace, by the way, is said to be amazing. Inspired by the C-X75 from the last Bond movie, Spectre, it has a projected range of just under 300 miles and promises 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds, with all the scoops, curves, air intakes, bells and whistles to match. I cannot wait.\n\nSo if the E-Pace isn't electric, then, what is it and why the name E-Pace? 'Because it's a mini F-Pace, stupid!' said my petulant nephew. 'That's why.'\n\n'Actually that's not why at all, you little git,' I replied (he's 39 and twice my size). The official reason is that, as the F-Pace echoes the F-Type, the E-Pace is meant to echo the XE and, just for the record, the I-Pace is Jaguar's polar-bear-friendly SUV inspired by its I-Type Formula E car. Clear as mud then. Methinks they've been over-thinking it. Or is that just me over-thinking their thinking over?\n\nNot that any of this will matter once the first 100,000 E-Paces are sold. It actually outsold the F-Pace for the first time last month. An even more impressive statistic when you take into account the fact the F-Pace is Jaguar's fastest-selling car of all time. This, as well as being voted World Car Of The Year in 2017. Remember when I said Jaguar would need a couple of years to catch up with Range Rover after the big Tata takeover? Well this is that, happening right now, in front of our very eyes.\n\nThe E-Pace is certainly as handsome and sporty as the F-Pace, if not more so, its compact, muscly torso giving the impression of a wound-up bundle of energy desperate to be unleashed, a look that almost renders the F-Pace long in the tooth by comparison. My test car also came in Borasco Grey Metallic, one of those super-cool, flat matt retro paint jobs that seem to be all the rage at the moment. I loved this colour, as did everyone else as I lapped up yet another epic test week. Evinced by two full refills at the service station, the only downside of which being what that might suggest re fuel economy.\n\nI'm more than happy to repeat Jaguar's claimed figure of 36.7mpg (depending on selected mode and driving style), just don't ask me to testify to that in court.\n\nNot that I did much to help matters. Quite the opposite, in fact. For the most part I drove the E-Pace R-Dynamic like I stole it. Suffice to say, we got on like a house on fire.\n\n'There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,' spouted Shakespeare. In which case, I think my penchant for the E-Pace might have something to do with a psychological hangover from when I got to drive one of the first available F-Paces up a particularly treacherous mountain road in South Africa. I was with my good friend, American blues legend Seasick Steve, an unforgettable few days during which we both became smitten by Jag's first foray into their now famous 'Pace' brand.\n\nThere are five engine options to choose from on the E-Pace configurator: three diesel and two more powerful petrol units. Mine was the lesser of the two petrol options at 250hp, compared with the range-topping 300hp. That said, the early customer favourite, according to initial orders, seems to be the 180hp diesel, which comes in at about \u00a335k with a half-decent spec. Whereas, even though the two petrol cars start, 'as standard', at around the same price, I would still choose either of these over the much slower diesel trio.\n\nTECH SPEC\n\nPrice \u00a350,995\n\nEngine 2.0-litre petrol turbo\n\nGearbox 8-speed auto\n\nPower 250hp\n\n0-60mph 6.6 seconds\n\nFuel economy 36.7mpg\n\nFirst year road tax \u00a3830\n\nThe petrol cars are almost a monumental three seconds quicker from 0-60mph at 6.6 seconds, as opposed to 9.4 seconds.\n\nFor five days straight, I had a blast in my E-Pace R-Dynamic. There was a bit more lag than I expected up through the gears to begin with, though this soon disappeared once I started to put the hammer down on a more regular basis. After which...\n\n'Dad, this car is fantastic,' screamed Noah, as we gunned down yet another undulating tunnel of tree-lined twists and turns up in the Surrey hills. The car may be quite heavy for its size but I didn't mind that at all - I actually thought it helped when it came to handling. Nor was there any discernible lunging back and forth under braking or acceleration.\n\nFrom inside the cockpit, with its lush, leather-clad, 18-way electrically heated memory front seats (a steal as a \u00a3310 extra) surrounded by a classy trim and fancy configurable ambient lighting (another \u00a3310), it was all Noah and I could do to stop smiling. Even the relatively minuscule rear windscreen, with its spider's web of heated elements, and the now dated-looking info screen tech, failed to dampen our enthusiasm - though they did contribute to reducing a potential five-star rating to four-and-a-half.\n\nBack to life, back to reality.\n\nYou can get into a brand new E-Pace (diesel) for less than the price of a new VW Golf GTi as they start at \u00a328k. That's one way of looking at it. Another way is, for the top-of-the-range R-Dynamic HSE (petrol) that I drove, you could almost buy two brand new GTis, as that came in at a far fruitier \u00a351k.\n\nIs it worth that?\n\nWell, for a start, it is massively over-spec'd considering what most people would probably go for, but otherwise I would say yes, definitely.\n\nThe inside of the cockpit, with its lush, leather-clad, 18-way electrically heated memory front seats (a steal as a \u00a3310 extra) surrounded by a classy trim and fancy ambient lighting\n\nNot that two of my best pals agreed. I let Noel Fitzpatrick The Supervet (Mr Range Rover Velar) and my Radio 2 breakfast show co-host Vassos Alexander (Mr Lexus RX) both have a go. After which, neither of them seemed to have the first clue as to what I was banging on about. But then again, who's going to admit to having bought the wrong car in a national newspaper column that your wife, kids, pals and co-workers read?\n\nSecretly, I think they both agree with me. Not that it matters, as Vassos has already put down a deposit on an I-Pace and I think Noel may have got his Velar for free.\n\nIn which case, we all remain in the Jaguar Land Rover fan club one way or another.

Then the following happened.\n\nA beaten-up caravan has been fly-tipped in the lane down from where we live, causing a temporary bottleneck. Not so much of a problem for me, as I love letting people through. I can't get enough of it.

I could easily have nipped by first but I literally couldn't wait to stop and flash the convoy through. All fine then, all good. Except after a hat-trick of grateful thank yous, a nod, a wave and a smile, in that order, I spontaneously burst into floods of tears.\n\nWhat a plonker. I can only conclude this spontaneous exchange of good will served as yet another emotional trigger, a metaphor if you like, for all the love and support my family and I have received since Mum passed away. Everyone has been so damn nice. I mean, extraordinarily nice.\n\nSobbing like a baby, however, is not exactly the textbook look for a poser behind the wheel of the balls-out new BMW M5 killing machine. Which is the very vehicle I happened to be in at the time. Oops.\n\nM-agnificent! M-azing! M-ammoth! M-ega! M-believable! That's five Ms for starters. In fact, let's dispense with any cod nonsense and declare this car an absolute superstar from the get-go. In which case, the 5 in M5 can also now refer to the number of stars at the top of the page. Put simply, this is an awesome bit of kit. I'm even beginning to get my head around the fact it might actually be worth the \u00a3102k the invoice for our test car topped out at. What follows, therefore, is a celebration of what is, as opposed to a desperate exercise in nit-picking as to what isn't.\n\nWhen it comes to agility - and don't forget we're talking about a sizeable lump here - it handles way better than almost anything similar. Albeit via a palpably firm ride\n\nThe first thing I liked about this majestic weapon is the fact that it doesn't feel the need to be quite as lairy as the M2, M3 or M4. Don't get me wrong, it's no shrinking violet. Maybe it just looks less flashy than it really is because of the understated Marina Bay Blue paint job, which was absolutely stunning. But often, less is more when it comes to the battle of the power bulges and I can't help thinking that is what's going on here. The overall look is one that purrs subtlety and sleekness rather than anarchy street fighter, yet with enough passive aggression to suggest potential menace and mayhem. I particularly like the fact that the bonnet sculpting has been pared down to just two sharp-edged fins instead of the usual verbose signature M series love handles. The more simple, the more confident. The more you have to shout about, the less you have to shout.\n\nThat said, firing up the monster 4.4-litre 600hp V8 any time before sunrise is a surefire way of finding out how much your neighbours love you. This is not a quiet car, in any of its four driving modes, but Sport or Sport+ is where the roars are at their most offensive rawest. Add to this dramatic spitting, popping and crackling on deceleration and that should be more than enough to test the resolve of even the most tolerant of innocent bystanders.\n\nOnce you've made it out of your local postcode, if you do happen to find a road that's long enough and desolate enough to unleash even half of the M5's potential fury, you will not be disappointed. Except, that is, if you lose concentration and the revs hit the limiter, which is a) very easy to do b) really embarrassing and c) really quite uncomfortable. In fact, this M5 is actually smoother (and more fun) to drive in automatic mode rather than paddle-shift. Not that this is a cop-out. It's still ludicrously stimulating, guaranteed to make your brain fizz and your bum tingle.\n\nFiring up the monster 4.4-litre 600hp V8 any time before sunrise is a surefire way of finding out how much your neighbours love you\n\nWith such power, then, how much do we need to fear stacking it into the nearest ditch?

A tanker of superglue couldn't provide more adhesion.\n\nWhat goes up must come down, of course, so with a 0-60mph time of 3.4 seconds and a kerb weight of nearly two tons, the optional (gold!) carbon ceramic brakes are a very sensible extra. Yes, they cost more than a brand new Dacia Duster, but if you can afford the \u00a37.5k you'll need to stump up, why wouldn't you?

Spooky that both came out in the same year, 1964. Not so spooky, however, that the aforementioned Jaguar chief designer is a huge fan. Take a look at the Bond Spectre C-X75 for yet more clues as to why the I-Pace looks so damn pretty.\n\nAnd we have to wonder what effect such form might have on existing rivals such as Tesla's SUV, the Model X, a car that suddenly looks like the emperor's new clothes. Was it ever the genius work of zen-like minimalism fawning doters (guilty as charged) gushed it might be? Or is it actually just a dull and unimaginative blob with a slightly bulbous conk and those fancy falcon-wing doors we all became obsessed with due to its first-past-the-post SUV EV status and its eccentric daddy Elon, he of Planet Musk.

The gorgeous steering wheel sets the tone for yet another dazzling assault of alluring aesthetics. Something so basic and simple is celebrated via a superconfident blend of Art Deco-style panache and Stark Industries fantasy and futurism. Enough to more than reassure the most cynical of doubters that just as much time, money, passion, talent and attention to detail has been lavished on every aspect of the I-Pace. An amazing all-round package surely destined to sweep the board come awards season later this year.\n\nAs for the surprisingly spacious interior - also down to the lack of prehistoric inner workings (gearbox, drivetrain, etc) - they've only gone and smashed it again\n\nThe Jaguar crew, keen to establish their new SUV's credentials on all sorts of terrain, pointed us in the direction of a very handy river and some acutely bumpy and dusty peaks and troughs - not to mention one of Europe's best-kept secrets, the Algarve International Circuit at Portimao. A testing ground worthy of any serious 4x4. But it's how the I-Pace performs on the open road that will be of interest to most people. And it took me and a couple of pals two, maybe three minutes to be able to confirm its prowess at acceleration, cornering and braking via such collective responses as 'Woah!', 'Oh. My. God', and 'Woah! again. Please excuse the repetition, but there was a lot of it going on.\n\nWith two electric motors (one driving the front wheels, another the rear), perfect 50/50 weight distribution and 394hp to play with, this is a seriously quick car that's exceptionally fun to chuck around.\n\nBack at the circuit, times all of the above by a thousand. The I-Pace fairly trounced a Model X around the 2.9-mile track, lasting a four laps at full tilt compared to the Tesla's much less remarkable... well, I'd rather not say.\n\nOther highlights included dual infotainment touchscreens, an idea borrowed from the Land Rover Velar and latest Range Rover, but with a new graphics package (thank the Lord). The in-car graduated acceleration-sound synthesiser, a pseudo-engine thrum pumped through the speakers that provides a soundtrack to what's happening beneath you. And then there's my standout feature: if you go for the non-leather-seat option, not only do they afford rear passengers more legroom, they also bring the I-Pace close to 100 per cent vegan. All Jaguar needs to finish the job is a substitute for a small area of glue - which currently has something or other from horses in it - used to attach the black plastic sill panels.\n\nWith a range of up to 290 miles and a satnav that not only tells you where to go but how much charge you'll have when you get there and gives energy updates en route, I can't see how rival manufacturers can outdo this electric superstar any time soon.

Such a deal, which would have the potential to upend the auto industry, would take time to complete and officials said they aren't optimistic Trump would accept it.\n\nThe EU is seeking to head off a U.S. probe into whether imports of cars and car parts damage national security, which could culminate in a Trump proposal to impose a 20 percent tariff on autos. Washington has already hit the EU with duties on its steel and aluminum exports using the same national-security justification. Juncker is seeking to tamp down the brewing conflict a month after the 28-nation bloc imposed levies on 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of American imports due to the metal tariffs.\n\n\"President Juncker and President Trump will focus on improving trans-Atlantic trade and forging a stronger economic partnership,\" the European Commission said in a statement Tuesday announcing the July 25 meeting. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow highlighted Juncker's trip, saying on Wednesday that the commission president \"is bringing a very important free-trade offer.\"\n\nVolkswagen shares gained as much as 2.7 percent and were up 2.4 percent to 147.52 euros at 5:25 p.m. in Frankfurt. BMW traded 1 percent higher and Daimler was up 1.1 percent. The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts Index rose 1.1 percent.\n\n\"Generally speaking, we support the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers when they're mutually applied and in line with WTO rules,\" Sandra Courant, a spokeswoman at German auto lobby group VDA, said on Wednesday, declining to comment on next week's meeting. \"We welcome talks and the end to a further escalation.\"\n\nEU member states are divided on the next course of action, according to the other official. Germany, which shipped 640,000 cars to the U.S. last year, is eager to negotiate a solution with President Trump while French officials consider the new auto tariffs a foregone conclusion.\n\nWhile some member states, including France, resist such a sweeping global deal on cars, there's no other legally possible concession the bloc can offer to appease Trump, according to one of the officials. Even as Juncker won't have a mandate to make a binding offer to Trump; he will float this option as this is the solution that the EU's executive arm considers to be realistic, the official said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a July 5 speech that the EU could reduce car tariffs as part of a broad free-trade agreement, which would have to include about 90 percent of commerce between the two regions. Alternately, the EU and U.S. could lower duties, which would be offered to all other WTO partners, she said.\n\nJuncker's visit comes after Trump singled out the bloc as a \"foe\" of the U.S, in comments highlighting the increasing strain in trans-Atlantic ties. Since Trump's election, the pillars of the West have parted ways in many key areas of policy, including the Paris agreement on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, and the Middle East peace process.\n\nEven as the EU's executive arm has angered Washington by imposing levies on iconic American brands such as Harley Davidson and Levi's jeans, its flamboyant head has refrained from personal attacks on the U.S. president, thus keeping channels of communication open. In contrast, EU Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the meetings of the bloc's leaders, has been among the harshest critics of Trump.\n\n\"America and the EU are best friends,\" Tusk said last week. \"Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news.\"\n\nThe EU isn't allowed under global rules to reduce its 10 percent tariff on American cars unless it either does so for WTO members as a whole or reaches a bilateral accord with the U.S. that covers \"substantially all\" two-way trade. A plurilateral deal modeled after the Information Technology Agreement, which abolished tariffs on some IT products traded between its signatories, is allowed under WTO rules.\n\nPlurilateral accords involve a group of like-minded countries that are typically limited to specific sectors of goods or services. The WTO permits these types of negotiations as long as the benefits are provided to all WTO members on a most-favored nation basis. It is faster and less burdensome to negotiate these accords rather than multilateral deals because they don't require the approval of all 164 WTO members.\n\nEarlier, when the EU unsuccessfully sought a permanent waiver from Trump's metals tariffs imposed in March, the bloc said it was willing to start negotiations with the U.S. on a relatively narrow trade deal focused on eliminating tariffs on industrial goods, including cars. That offer went nowhere, according to European officials.", "This supercar has spent time all over the world. Its new home could be your garage.\n\nIt's odd to think of a $649,000 vehicle being inexpensive, but by the recent standards of BMW M1s for sale, the cost of this gorgeous, dark blue example that's currently available in Miami.\n\nAccording to the dealer selling the supercar, this one has quite a story to go with it. BMW allegedly invited a former journalist to buy the car, which was one of the last produced. He took delivery in Germany, and then took the supercar with him over the course of 36 years to in South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, Arizona, and Miami. In that time, the M1 covered just 8,078 miles (13,000 kilometers).\n\nGet A Better Understanding Of The BMW M1:\n\nMotor1.com Legends: 1978 BMW M1Hidden Headlamps: 11 Cars With The Best Pop-Up Headlights\n\nBMW only built 453 units of the M1 from 1978 to 1981. According to the seller, the car was one of 58 road cars in this dark blue shade. It still comes with the original Pirelli P7 tires, too. Inside, this M1 features a mix of black cloth upholstery on the seats with black leather bolsters and lots more cowhide adorns the cabin. The only modification from stock is a 1980s Blaupunkt stereo, including an awesome equalizer at the bottom of the center stack.\n\nLike all road-going examples the M1, this one features a mid-mounted 3.5-liter inline six that connects to a five-speed manual gearbox. The engine produces 274 horsepower (204 kilowatts) and 243 pound-feet (330 Newton-meters) of torque.\n\nThe M1 was originally supposed to result from a cooperation between Lamborghini and BMW. However, financial issues caused the Italians to step away from the project. BMW kept going, and the first-ever M model was the result.\n\nRecent M1s we have seen have been far more expensive. In May 2018, a white one showed up for $875,000, and a fully restored example in April was going for $930,000. In 2017, there was an orange M1 selling for $745,000.\n\nThis content was produced on behalf of MotorGT.com and its partners.

What's more likely is that the LSY is the third iteration of the GM 2.0L turbo inline four-cylinder Dual OverHead Cam (DOHC) engine architecture, which began with the LNF and was succeeded by the LTG.\n\nIn the 2016-2018 Cadillac CT6, the LTG was rated at 265 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. Despite producing healthy power and torque figures, the engine has been criticized for not having sufficient levels of refinement when compared to similar engines from direct competitors, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. We've heard through the grapevine that, because of this, engineers focused on significantly improving refinement and \"feel\" with the LSY motor.\n\nTo that end, we do not currently know how the LSY will be rated in the 2019 CT6, as GM/Cadillac have yet to share the engine's output in the CT6. However, we know that the engine makes 237 horses and 258 pound-feet of torque in the 2019 XT4, but that application has a completely different driveline compared to the CT6: whereas the XT4 has a transverse engine placement with a 9-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels (with optional AWD), the CT6 has a longitudinally-placed engine sending power to the rear wheels.\n\nTraditionally, GM vehicles with a longitudinal powertrain orientation have had higher power and torque ratings than transverse-engined counterparts when using the same engine. As such, we would assume that the 2019 Cadillac CT6 with the new LSY engine will make at least 265 horsepower and an equal amount of torque, if not more - all while delivering higher levels of refinement over the LTG.\n\nNotably, the 2019 CT6 will pair the new 2.0L Turbo LSY engine with the new GM 10-speed automatic transmission (RPO code MHS). By comparison, the 2.0L Turbo LSY was mated to the outgoing 8-speed gearbox, which - much like its engine pairing - has criticized as lacking in the refinement department.\n\nThe 2019 Cadillac CT6 with the 2.0L Turbo LSY engine will send power exclusively to the rear wheels, as all-wheel-drive will not be available.\n\nThe updated Cadillac CT6 will become available in the fall of 2018 as a 2019 model. The refreshed model features revised styling, a new trim level structure, the new Cadillac twin-turbo 4.2L V8 DOHC engine (LTA) and a new CT6 V-Sport model. Inside, the 2019 CT6 facelift adds several interior enhancements, the most notable of which are tactile controls for the Cadillac infotainment system and an improved Rear Camera Mirror.\n\nPricing has not yet been announced, but we expect a starting price for the base 2019 CT6 with the 2.0L Turbo LSY engine to be similar to, if not slightly higher than, the $54,000 base MSRP of the 2018 model.\n\nThe Cadillac CT6 is a full-size prestige luxury sedan. It slots above the mid-size Cadillac CTS and compact Cadillac ATS as the largest Cadillac sedan. The vehicle rides on the advanced, high-tech and lightweight GM Omega platform that is currently not shared with any other vehicles, though a full-size Cadillac crossover on the architecture has been rumored.\n\nThe current model was introduced for the 2016 model year and represents the first model year of the first-generation CT6. The 2017 model year saw a few minor changes, including the addition of two new exterior colors and darker finish taillamps. The 2018 CT6 introduced such features as Super Cruise, Rear Camera Mirror Washer for the Rear Camera Mirror, as well as an updated CUE infotainment system (to version 2.6).\n\nFor the 2019 model year, the CT6 receives a refresh, otherwise known as a facelift or mid-cycle enhancement (MCE, that includes revised exterior styling similar to that of the Escala concept, a new high-performance V-Sport model, the new Cadillac 4.2L Twin-Turbo V-8 engine, a new trim level structure, and improvements to in-vehicle technology. In addition, the 2019 Cadillac CT6 gets the new GM 10-speed automatic transmission on all models, while the base model gets a new base engine in the form of the all-new 2.0L Turbo LSY engine, which replaces the last-generation 2.0L Turbo LTG.", "If you know me, you know that I don't know how to ride a motorcycle, nor have I ever ridden on or even been on ...\n\nIf you know me, you know that I don't know how to ride a motorcycle, nor have I ever ridden on or even been on the back of one. And, in fact, I don't ever really plan on doing so. Paraphrasing Jerry Seinfeld, when I get the cancer diagnoses, I'll head straight to the Ducati store. Until then, I'll stick with cars. However, I do like bikes. I like the look of them, I can appreciate the experience that they offer and I think they're cool. Especially bikes like this BMW R nineT Urban GS, which was just recently featured on Carfection.\n\nLike me, Carfection doesn't really ever talk about motorcycles. It's just not really their thing. However, taking a bit of a brake from their typical videos, Tim Stevens hopes on the BMW R nineT Urban GS for a blast up some twisty and beautiful California mountain roads.\n\nThe Urban GS is the sort of bike I think I'd be into if I were to get one. It's tough looking and packs a punchy little air-cooled V-twin engine, making a rough, aggressive noise. It isn't flashy, it isn't crazy fast. It's just cool. It looks like something Steve McQueen would ride today, if he were alive. I like the way it looks and I like the way it sounds.\n\nApparently, you can get the Urban GS with knobbly tires, for some dirt road use, but Stevens suggests otherwise, as he feels it's more of an urban bike, as its name suggests. According to Stevens, the V-twin's punchy torque makes it better for nipping through city traffic or shooting out of tighter, twisty corners. It also has a bit of vibration, so it's not a great cruiser or touring bike.\n\nPersonally, I don't think I'll ever ride a bike unless, as previously mentioned, I get some really bad medical news. However, I do like them and I even sort of want to own a classic '50s BMW motorcycle, not to ride it but just to have it, tinker with it and look at it. Certain mechanical things make me happy and this BMW R nineT Urban GS does that. Plus, according to Stevens, it seems like a fun little bike to ride.", "Marylou's has two locations in Weymouth, where Sgt.

On Wednesday, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation pledged $100,000 toward Chesna's family's home mortgage. A Brockton-based business, White's Bakery and Cafe, made black and blue half-moon cookies, with proceeds going toward a donation the company matched. And other businesses throughout the region have followed suit, donating money to the Michael Chesna Family Fund.\n\nChesna, 42, responded to a crash near South Shore Hospital on Sunday morning, toward the end of his shift. While searching for a man who fled from a BMW involved in the crash, Chesna encountered Lopes, who, prosecutors say, threw a rock 10 to 12 feet toward Chesna, knocking him to the ground. Police say Lopes then picked up Chesna's gun, shot him numerous times and also killed 77-year-old Vera Adams with the same gun while running through the neighborhood.\n\nLopes, who was charged with two counts of murder, was held without bail following his arraignment Tuesday in Quincy District Court.\n\nMarylou's is offering the free coffee throughout the day on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"We just felt it was a little something we could do in his memory,\" McDonough said. \"We know they could use the support right now.\"", "Chennai: HighlightsRs 170 crore in cash and 100 kg gold has been recovered in raids Most of the cash was stashed in big travel bags and in parked cars SPK group is a partnership firm engaged in road and highway construction\n\nTax raids on a road construction company in Tamil Nadu have led to one of the biggest recoveries in the country so far of illegal cash and gold.

After she found out about his earlier relationship, she was quite hurt. It is suspected that they must have had arguments over it,\" said the officer.\n\nBatra had allegedly jumped from the terrace of her house on Friday. Her family alleged that Singhvi used to physically abuse her and they also accused his parents of harassing her for dowry.\n\nSinghvi was arrested yesterday and was today produced in a city court that sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.\n\n\"We will apply for his custody after recording the statements of witnesses,\" the official added.\n\nA family friend of the victim said the police informed them about Singhvi's court hearing half an hour before her cremation.\n\n\"The cremation was planned for 12 pm today. The police were aware about it. We were told that the hearing would take place at 2 pm but at 11:30 am we were informed that the hearing was re-scheduled for 12 pm.

We need media support. His parents should also be arrested because they have constantly instigated fights between them,\" she alleged.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (South) Romil Baaniya said Singhvi's parents had been granted exemption from joining the probe by the court till July 20 on personal grounds.\n\nThey would be questioned after that, he said.\n\nThe officer said the victim's parents told the magistrate that Batra was harassed for dowry and they would be speaking to her parents.\n\nBaaniya also said they would try to ascertain the reason for the argument between the couple, following which Batra had allegedly jumped from the terrace.\n\nThe victim had sent a message to her husband that \"he would see her dead face\" before taking the extreme step, police said.\n\nBatra's family alleged that her husband used to \"physically assault\" her and also ask for money. Another issue the couple had a fight about was Batra selling off her flat in Vasant Vihar, he said.\n\nThe officer said Singhvi, a software engineer in Gurgaon, used to earn Rs four crore per year and gifted luxurious items to Batra.

Everyone except for me.\n\nFirst of all, I have been packing for months. I think there must be a thing about packing your child up for their first time at sleep-away camp because I became an absolute freak show.\n\nMuddy sneakers? Not to worry, we have three pairs of alternatives. Wet bathing suits? Thank goodness we packed seven extras. Shower \"caddy\" with enough toiletries to make to 2019. Disposable cameras, flashlights that double as bedroom lamps, camp stationary with address labels -- we got it all.\n\nAnd then there are name labels, stickers, iron-ons -- whatever you call them. I labeled everything -- down to the toothpaste -- with pink labels from Mable's Labels, a company apparently dedicated solely to producing bespoke camp name labels that are offered in an endless array of formats, fonts and colors.\n\n\"Mom, everyone has them. It's very important.\" Selma informed me in the kind of grave tones normally reserved for State Department communiques.\n\nSo is the color and font, apparently. Selma chose pink, hot pink and purple for her labels. Her name appears in a gilded script suggestive of Louis XIV. You can imagine what the Crest toothpaste label looks like.\n\nThen came clothing: 25 pairs of socks and underpants, because the packing list was sure to explain, \"You can never pack too much.\" Really? So I doubled the suggested amount. On pretty much everything.\n\nThank goodness for the \"soft trunk\" we bought from the online camp store, also with Selma's name in hot pink across the front. When I went to camp in New Jersey beautiful but mosquito-filled Pine Barrens centuries ago, we had old fashioned hard trunks, like the kind people brought on the Titanic. If something didn't fit, we left it behind. The trunks doubled as our wardrobes by our beds. Did I mention our bunkhouses had no screens or plumbing?\n\nCamps are different now, even in the wilds of Maine. Cabins have screens and bathrooms, and the soft trunk is an elastic enabler to the mother's over-packing instincts. A soft trunk is basically a duffel bag big enough to hold three small children. Even big children. You can cram pretty much anything in it. So I did.\n\n\"Yeah, I pretty much bought out Lester's\" my friend told me as she prepared for her daughter sleep-away camp for the first time. Lester's is every girl's favorite store and it features an entire \"sleep-away camp\" array that is put out in early spring, like new Paris fashions. We are new to Lester's, but we learned fast: don't go if you are feeling cheap. Like Paris fashions.\n\nThe other lesson: massive parental overcompensation in packing a child off to a distant sleep-away camp that feels inextricably linked to the remorse of sending your child away at all. Plus guilt and anxiety at whether the sleeping bag is the right kind. I was a mess.\n\nSelma, of course, couldn't wait to go. This is a kid who has been drawing pictures of \"bunk life\" for months and making stories up about \"bunk best friends.\" It seems to be all about the bunk.\n\n\"If you have a child who is begging to go to sleep-away camp, it means they are ready,\" my friend assured me. But then again, she bought out Lester's.\n\nBut what about that old Allan Sherman song about Camp Granada, where the kid begs his parents to get him because his bunk mate has malaria and the lake has alligators? I mean I know there is no malaria or alligators in Maine, but its got deer ticks and horse flies the size of BMWs.\n\n\"Maybe she will be miserable,\" my husband said helpfully.\n\nSelma is not miserable. According to the head counselor, she is having \"the time of her life.\"\n\nBut what if the head counselor is deceiving us while Selma wanders the rugged backwoods of Maine, fighting off bears, swimming down icy rivers and hiding naked inside dead horses like Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Revenant?\" Didn't they get hypothermia back then?\n\nTo make matters worse, Selma wants to extend her two weeks at camp to five weeks. Five weeks?\n\n\"Most kids around here go for eight weeks,\" another Greenwich mother explained.\n\nBut that's pretty much the entire summer!\n\n\"That's the point,\" she said, brushing off my first time out-of-the-nest issues. \"And she is going to love it, so get a hold of yourself. It's good for them.\"\n\nSo buck up I will, as Yoda would say. I am genuinely thrilled my daughter is making this leap of independence. I hope it will be one of her most memorable and wonderful summers of her young life. How could it not be with Mabel's Labels?\n\nBut it doesn't mean that I don't linger at her bedroom door as I pass by. Or notice our dog sleeping in her empty bedroom.\n\nI miss her, and it's only just starting.\n\nClaire Tisne Haft is a former publishing and film executive, raising her family in Greenwich while working on a freelance basis on books and films.", "I am after a collector bike from 1994 or earlier.

Police say Lopes then picked up Chesna's gun, shot him numerous times and also killed 77-year-old Vera Adams with the same gun while running through the neighborhood.\n\nLopes, who was charged with two counts of murder, was held without bail following his arraignment Tuesday in Quincy District Court.\n\nMarylou's is offering the free coffee throughout the day on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\"We just felt it was a little something we could do in his memory,\" McDonough said. \"We know they could use the support right now.\"", "Own a Bentley Bentayga or a brand new BMW company car and you'll be fine with London's new huge ULEZ - drive a five-year-old Ford Focus or a classic car and you'll get clobbered.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan dropped a bombshell he has been itching to deliver last week, with a massive extension of London's ultra-low emission zone.\n\nAnd on that bombshell (to borrow a Top Gear catchphrase) he dropped another - the ULEZ extended out to the North and South Circular, encompassing a major chunk of residential London, will carry no resident discount.\n\nGood: Drive a brand new \u00a3160,000 gas-guzzling 6 litre and 2.4 tonne Bentley Bentayga 4x4 and you won't fall foul of the ULEZ as it meets the required euro standard\n\nSo, if you live in the area and your car isn't new enough to meet the emissions standards, from 2021 you must pay \u00a312.50 if you use it at any time, on any day of the year.\n\nThis is bad news for most people with a petrol car made before 2006, so not meeting euro 4 standard, and more critically for those with diesel cars not meeting euro 6 standard, most cars sold before September 2015.\n\nIt also leads to the slightly perverse situation where someone could drop the kids off in a \u00a3160,000 6 litre Bentley Bentayga 4x4 without forking out a penny, but use a trusty old 2011 diesel Ford hatchback instead - current value \u00a35,000 - and you get hit by a \u00a312.50 daily charge.\n\nThis is obviously an example that pulls out polar opposites, but there will be contrasts such as this cropping up all over the place.\n\nI imagine this will go down a treat with parents who need to drive their children to breakfast club, so mum or dad can then go to work, and must now buy a new car or pay \u00a362.50 a week.\n\nThe richer you are, the more able you are to buy a new car. That makes this a highly regressive charge.\n\nWhat's worse for the cash-strapped or fans of bargain motoring is that the most you can lose on a \u00a32,000 car is two grand, for example, whereas if you buy a new car - or even a second hand one that passes the required euro standards - you will lose thousands more in depreciation.\n\nBad: Own a classic car like this 1968 Mercedes 280SL and live within the ultra-low emissions zone and you will have to pay \u00a312.50 if you drive it at any time, of any day of the year\n\nIt is also a huge headache for those of us who live in London and own a classic car.\n\nMy little Peugeot 205 GTI does less than 3,000 miles a year, mainly outside London. In a short period of time, I will have to pay \u00a312.50 if it is driven day or night, 365 days a year. Even if I only drove it once a week, that would be \u00a3650.\n\nMeanwhile, a company car driver racking up 15,000 miles a year in a bland new saloon or SUV pays not a penny.\n\nI'm biased, but classic cars are a great sight on our streets - and I see plenty on my cycle across London to work each day. Does Sadiq really want the ULEZ to drive classic cars off London's roads?\n\nYet, this column is not to bemoan my lot as someone privileged enough to own a classic car. Instead, it is to point out the glaring inconsistencies the ULEZ extension with no resident discount brings.\n\nULEZ will cover central London from 2019, but under the new plans will be extended massively to all of London within the North and South Circular two years later\n\nA London Councils report shows the sources of nitrogen oxide in the Greater London air - roads transport contributes 50%, with petrol cars making up 6% of overall total and diesel 12%\n\nLondon's air could do with cleaning up.\n\nCar ownership contributes to the bad-for-your-health nitrogen oxide pumped into the air, but it's not the only cause.\n\nLondon Council stats from 2013 show petrol cars contributed 6 per cent and diesel cars 12 per cent, with the remaining 50 per cent of the total NOx accounted for by road transport coming from taxis, vans, minibuses, buses and lorries.\n\nEncouraging polluting cars off the road is not a bad move, however, it could be done without such a punitive system.\n\nThe inner congestion charge zone could carry the \u00a312.50 charge, while the outer zone could operate daytime Monday to Friday, with a resident-only discount to \u00a35.\n\nThis would be enough to discourage many journeys and dramatically clean up the air.\n\nIt should have been tried first before this regressive and perverse plan.\n\nMost of you won't live in London, so you may think 'why does this even matter to me?' It matters because this is a sign of things to come. Where London leads cities and towns across the UK will follow.\n\nThat's bad news for those who prefer good value second hand cars, or classics, to losing thousands in depreciation on new motors.\n\nWhat are the ULEZ car standards? Euro 4 for petrol cars, vans, minibuses and other specialist vehicles: this covers most new registrations from January 2006.Euro 6 for diesel cars, vans and minibuses and other specialist vehicles: this covers most new registrations from September 2015.\n\nIt is possible that cars before these dates can be compliant and also that cars after these dates may not be.

Surtees was gifted his 507 by MV Agusta, for winning a championship while riding an MV and he's owned it until his death last year. It now just sold at auction in Goodwood for almost double what it was projected to sell for.\n\nEven after Surtees ended up racing for Ferrari, and was forced to buy a Ferrari with his own money by Enzo himself, he still kept his BMW 507. In fact, Surtees felt that it needed a bit of modification to make it perfect and he went back to BMW for it. So his 507 is not just unique because he owned it but because it's actually faster and a bit sharper than a standard 507.\n\nSo it truly is a one-of-a-kind BMW 507 and it's a one-owner car, with that owner being a legend in motorsport. It's no surprise, then, that it sold for big bucks at auction at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. It was expected to sell for about $2.6 -- 2.9 million, but it actually sold for a record-breaking $5,026,522, making it the most expensive 507 ever. Possibly even the most expensive BMW ever sold.\n\nNot only is it the most expensive 507 ever sold, it was the third most expensive car sold at Goodwood. Only two cars sold for more and both were even more special, such as a 1932 Alfa Romeo Tipo B Gran Prix Monoposto, which sold for over $6-million, and a 1961 Aston Martin DB4GT Zagato \"MP209\", which sold for a whopping $13.2-million.\n\nThe BMW 507 is not only the most beautiful BMW ever made, it's one of the most beautiful roadsters of all time. John Surtees' car is even more special and even more rare than the already incredibly rare 507 itself. So we completely understand it selling for the money it did. Even if it baffles my mind a bit to spend that much money on a single car. I would if I could, though.

'I truly feel the story of Matt's passing can be a message that will save numerous lives.'\n\nEarlier this week, Dr Alberto Solas from Clear Sky Recovery wrote: 'Matthew Mellon was scheduled to check-in on April 16th. We learned that he had died at his hotel on the 16th, prior to his check-in.'\n\nPrior to his death he was said to be three months sober and dating Kick Kennedy, 30, a model and daughter of Robert F.

Kennedy's model manager Christine Schott told PEOPLE: 'She is heartbroken, shocked, she didn't see this coming\n\nInitial reports claimed that the ex-husband of Jimmy Choo guru Tamara Mellon had died from a heart attack inside his rehab facility after taking a hallucinogenic treatment drug - but this was later dismissed by a representative for the Mellons who adjusted the family statement to make clear he died before and not in rehab.\n\nA representative for Mellon issued a statement to the New York Post immediately after news of his death broke on the 16th and said: 'Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was attending a drug rehabilitation facility'.\n\nThis statement was amended with no explanation on April 18th to say that Mellon died in Cancun 'where he was planning to check into a rehab facility for follow-up treatment'.\n\nThe circumstances of Mellon's hotel death are not yet clear.\n\nMellon, who had been battling an OxyContin addiction and once spent $100,000 a month on the drug, was 88 days sober when he took his private jet to the Cancun center for 'maintenance'.\n\nThe facility where he was due to check-in specializes in drug addiction treatment using Ibogain, a psychedelic plant-based drug which is not approved for any medical uses in the United States.\n\nOn Clear Sky Recovery's website it says: 'Ibogaine provides a gentle, painless, and very rapid detox from opioids such a heroin, methadone, OxyContin, Suboxone & Subutex; stimulants like cocaine, crack and methamphetamine, as well as alcohol and many other addictive drugs.\n\n'Ibogaine works differently than other drug treatments, it resets receptors in the brain and normalizes brain function. Ibogaine's metabolite noribogaine decreases or eliminates cravings and removes the overwhelming compulsion to use drugs of abuse, for approximately 2-4 months following ibogaine treatment.\n\n'Patients who are physically dependent on heroin, morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, or any other opioid drugs, will receive regular doses of morphine to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

My understanding was that it was just a check-up.\n\n'He was literally drinking cups of tea and doing the whole holistic, herbal thing.\n\n'I was very proud of his commitment. He was family to me and he was trying to be his best for all of us, with the brightest future ahead. Saying this is a tragic loss, is an understatement.

It's anti-America,' Mellon told Forbes, explaining that he chose Ripple because he is 'pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank.'\n\nMatthew (center), pictured with wedding guests Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley, at his wedding to Tamara Mellon, which was held at Blenheim Palace\n\nHe stayed friends with Hurley, sharing this photo of himself with the bikini mogul in 2013\n\nIn 2015 he shared this 2009 photo of himself with friends and fellow trust funders Stavros Niarchos, center, and Alex von Furstenberg, right, whose mother Diane hosted Mellon's second wedding\n\nMatthew's eldest child is daughter Araminta, aka Minty, from his marriage to ex-wife Tamara Mellon.\n\nIn excerpts from her autobiography, In My Shoes, published in the Daily Mail in 2013, she wrote that she and Matthew met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London in 1998 and embarked on a six month transatlantic relationship that culminated with a marriage proposal involving a helicopter, poetry and a rose petal-strewn limousine.\n\nThey married in 2000, at a ceremony held at Blenheim Palace, birthplace of Winston Churchill, attended by 300 guests including Hugh Grant and Liz Hurley.\n\nTamara, who the co-founder and former chief creative officer of couture shoe makers Jimmy Choo, wrote that Matthew suffered from a cocaine addiction during their marriage.\n\nMellon is pictured in NYC in 2014. By his 21st birthday, had inherited $25million -- with 13 more trusts to come his way\n\n'Matthew had so many talents and admirable qualities - it's unfortunate that emotional stability was not among them,' Tamara wrote in her book.\n\n'Once we were back in London, life did not become any easier. I was in the office every day, working hard, and Matthew had nothing but free time on his hands - and I'd come home and find him freebasing cocaine in the kitchen.\n\n'Then his addiction would take over and he might step out to buy a paper and not come back for days. I was constantly trying to track him down, calling family members, calling car services, knowing that he was capable of turning up anywhere in the world.\n\n'He would check into hotels, start getting the paranoid delusions of cocaine psychosis, then leave without paying his bill. And then, of course, the hotel managers would call me to clean up after him and settle his accounts.'\n\nTamara wrote that Matthew was sent to rehab for the first time while still in college and inherited his father's bipolar illness.\n\nShe also recalled the occasion in which she and Matthew's friend, Henry Dent-Brocklehurst, tracked Matthew down at a crack house in London's Notting Hill.\n\nMatthew is pictured with wife Nicole at the OMEGA Speedmaster Dark Side of the Moon Launch Event, New York, in June 2014. They split up the next year. She recently remarried\n\nHappier times: The couple posed up with Air Force One with their son Force in this 2014 snap\n\nShe described coming across a 'gangster-type sitting alone in the kitchen, with Matthew's wallet on the table in front of him.'\n\n'For a moment I feared he had been murdered,' Tamara wrote. 'Then Henry said to the drug dealer: \"You'd better tell us where he is, otherwise you're going to be looking down the wrong end of a shotgun.\"\n\n'It was all bluster, and the dealer was not terribly impressed. Later, we learned Matthew had been hiding under a bed.'\n\nTamara said that she tried to keep Matthew sober, but that his drug problems only got worse after their daughter, Minty, was born in 2002.\n\nA year later, after he relapsed and disappeared during a bender that lasted for several days during a trip to Ibiza, Tamara broke it off with Matthew.\n\nTamara and Matthew Melon are seen in this 2003 photo. Tamara said that she tried to keep Matthew sober, but that his drug problems only got worse after their daughter, Minty, was born in 2002\n\nBut further drama was to come when Matthew was arrested for hacking into Tamara's computers.\n\nIn her book she says: 'I began to receive emails claiming to have \"things on your soon-to-be-ex husband\".\n\n'I thought this sounded not only sleazy but creepy. The Metropolitan Police showed up and asked to examine my computer.\n\n'They explained that the emails I'd been receiving were Trojan horse messages containing viruses. If opened, this malware could record every keystroke on my keyboard.\n\n'It transpired Matthew had hired a company called Active Investigation Services to explore my electronic transactions. This company was run by a couple of former policemen who were already under surveillance for a lucrative sideline in illegal wire-tapping and computer hacking. To keep Matthew on the hook, they'd even sent him a bogus email, supposedly from my lawyer, alluding to several million I'd supposedly secreted away in Malaysia.\n\n'The climax of this series of events occurred when London's finest raided Matthew's apartment at 6am and took him away in handcuffs. My husband was charged with criminal conspiracy and faced the possibility of five years in prison.\n\nMatthew Mellon is pictured at Southwark Crown Court in London in 2006 during his trial\n\nIn 2013 he shared this photo of himself with John Bolton, now an advisor to Donald Trump\n\n'In April 2007, I received a subpoena to testify at Matthew's trial. The proceedings were at Southwark Crown Court and I appeared on May 3.\n\n'The issue, at least insofar as Matthew was concerned, was whether he was criminally responsible for authorizing the illegal hacking of my computer. There was no question that he'd given the indicted investigators \u00a312,000 ($17,000) and that he'd signed the contract.\n\n'But that still left the issue of responsibility - knowing what was going on, knowing that it was illegal, and then doing it anyway. When I saw him on trial, my heart went out to him. I thought, 'Oh boy. You're really in over your head this time.'\n\n'As the victim of Matthew's supposed crime, I was actually called as a witness for the prosecution. This was no time to gild the lily, so I simply told the truth. I said being married to Matthew was like having another child. I said he couldn't keep up with his bills or bank accounts and that he missed aeroplanes the way other people miss buses.\n\n'When asked about Matthew's reading habits and powers of concentration, I simply said that my husband couldn't manage a comic book, much less a legal document. The courtroom erupted.\n\n'The trial took six weeks, with the jury deliberating for five days. Two of the detectives were convicted, but happily Matthew was not.'\n\nDespite all the drama the two remained close, so much so that Tamara would be a guest at Matthew's second marriage and they continued to jointly raise Minty.\n\nMatthew pictured with son, Force Mellon (left), at a Hanley Mellon fashion show in 2015. Tamara pictured with Matthew and her daughter, Minty Mellon, in 2004\n\nMatthew's two other children, son, Force, and daughter, Olympia, are from his second marriage to ex-wife, Nicole Hanley Mellon, herself an heiress.\n\nMatthew and Nicole met in 2006 at a wedding in Palm Beach, Florida, they told the New York Times in 2014, months before launching their clothing line, Hanley Mellon.\n\nMatthew proposed to Nicole in 2008 and they married in 2010, at an impromptu ceremony at family friend Diane Von Furstenberg's home in the Bahamas' Harbor Island.\n\nFamous friends: Mellon shared this photo of himself with Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in 2015.

According to W Magazine, Matthew's father, Karl Mellon, committed suicide in 1983, when Matthew was 18.\n\nHis aunt was Bunny Mellon - the noted socialite, funder of John Edwards and friend of Jackie Kennedy who died in 2014.\n\nBy his 21st birthday, had inherited $25million spread across 14 trust funds.\n\nHe shared this photo with friend an dfamous guitarist Nile Rodgers\n\nWhile at Penn he bought a 10-bedroom house just for parties, bought the first BMW M5 in America and had a speedboat.\n\nHe also dated fellow Penn student Tory Burch.\n\nHe then moved to LA, bought Ferraris, a home in Malibu, a home in Beverly Hills and spent time with infamous madame Heidi Fleiss and her girls.\n\nMany of his friends also had famous last names - including Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece, who told Forbes in 2014 that Mellon is 'a fun guy'.\n\nHe went through much of his trust fund largess.\n\nMatthew attended and graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was the chairman of the New York Republican Party's finance committee from 2011 to 2013, during which time he raised funds for the party.\n\nIn 2016, he told Page Six that he developed his $100,000 per month OxyContin addiction after getting hooked on prescriptions given to him by doctors following a surfing injury.\n\nOxyContin, a time-release version of oxycodone, has long been the world's top-selling opioid painkiller and was hailed as a breakthrough treatment for chronic pain when it was approved in late 1995.\n\nMeant to work over 12 hours to maintain a steady level of oxycodone in patients suffering from a wide range of pain ailments, some users quickly discovered they could get a heroin-like high by crushing the pills and snorting or injecting the entire dose at once.\n\nMatthew's funeral will take place next weekend at St. Joseph's Episcopal Church in Boynton Beach, Florida.", "The development of the 7 Series facelift continues today at the Nurburgring, where our spies were able to capture the dreaded \"pig nose\" LCI in more detail than before. Also, we got a pretty good look at the M Sport package. 11 photosOr at least we think it's an M Sport and not M Performance based on the color of the brakes. However, BMW could just be toying with us, developing a replacement for the M760Li right under our noses.\n\nReports of the V12 engine's demise have been around for a while, and with new emissions regulations just around the corner, now's as good a time as any to downsize. A recent trademark for \"M750\" models suggests the luxury saloon might be getting the powertrain from the M850i XDrive Coupe.\n\nSure, it's still just another 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, but one with new internals and turbos that help it deliver 530 horsepower. While there's no reason to believe this is what we're seeing, we couldn't help noticing the roll cage and bucket seeds inside the prototype.\n\nWhile we have seen the new face of the 7 Series LCI before, a layer of the camouflage has been peeled off the grille, allowing us to see what's going on much better. While the inspiration is clearly the X7, the design has been rounded off a bit.\n\nNot every 7 Series will have this front end though. The myriad of small intakes and vents replicates the M5 and other upcoming M models. Blue laser headlights also let you know this is the boss' car.\n\nOther engine changes are also planned for next year. For example, the 740i will get a power boost from 326 to 340 HP, while the 740e is going to be replaced by the 745e with a bigger electric motor. We've even seen the Alpina testing in Germany!", "Republican lawmakers are also attempting to avert any auto tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to ramp up the trade conflict with the European Union unless the group's leaders agree to significant concessions.\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting, Trump insisted that European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker needs to make a major trade offer to lower barriers on automobiles during his trip to the US. Otherwise, Trump said, the US will be forced to hit the EU with trade restrictions.\n\n\"We said if we don't negotiate something fair, we have tremendous retribution which we don't want to use but we have tremendous powers,\" Trump said. \"Including cars, cars is the big one, and you know what we're talking about with respect to cars and tariffs on cars.\"\n\nThe US Commerce Department is in the midst of an investigation into auto imports, and Trump has previously threatened large tariffs on imported cars. Such a move would represent a massive escalation of Trump's tariffs on the EU and likely push the two sides into a full-on trade war.\n\nWhile Trump has been critical of auto imports throughout his presidency, the president announced in May that the US would launch an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. That end result could be more tariffs - and likely economic turmoil.\n\nTrump has directly threatened to impose a tariff of 20% on auto imports from the EU to the US.\n\n\"Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the US and its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the US,\" Trump tweeted. \"Build them here!\"\n\nMany European automakers, including brands like BMW and Mercedes, already produce cars at plants in the US.\n\nAny tariffs on vehicles would be a massive escalation in the trade fight between the EU and US. In 2017, the US imported just over $43 billion worth of vehicles just for people transportation. Any measures on automobiles would dwarf those on steel and aluminum, which hit a little over $7 billion worth of EU exports to the US.\n\nA hearing on the possibility of auto tariffs is scheduled for Thursday, with dozens of speakers from across the industry set to weigh in. Following the hearing, the Commerce Department could release a recommendation on the tariffs within weeks.\n\nWhile Trump appears ready for a high-stakes show down, automakers from around the world begged the president to deescalate the conflict in a letter released Wednesday.\n\nSeven auto industry trade groups that represent large automakers like Ford, GM, and Toyota, as well as dealers and parts manufacturers, said tariffs on imports auto goods would be damaging to the US economy and American consumers.\n\n\"Raising tariffs on autos and auto parts would be a massive tax on consumers who buy or service their vehicles - whether imported or domestically produced,\" the letter said. \"These higher costs will inevitably lead to declining sales and the loss of American jobs, as well as increasing vehicle service and repair costs that may result in consumers delaying critical vehicle maintenance.\"\n\nAlmost every major auto manufacturer, from foreign companies BMW and Hyundai to American brands like GM and Ford, submitted comments to the Commerce Department warning about the possible impact of tariffs on US auto workers and consumers.\n\nMembers of Congress have also pushed back on the president's plans.\n\nSens. Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, and Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, said Wednesday that they were working on a bill that would at least delay auto tariffs for some time. Both senators represent states with large auto manufacturing bases.\n\nAccording to Politico, the bill would pause the Commerce Department's investigation on autos until after the International Trade Commission conducts its own study. The senators say the measure would give Trump time to change his mind.\n\n\"I realize that folks affected by these proposed tariffs are looking for a silver bullet to stop them dead in their tracks,\" Jones told Politico. \"Right now, the only silver bullet in this case is for the president to change his mind.\"\n\nThe bill also comes as more Republican lawmakers threaten to wrest control of trade policy back from the president. GOP Sens. Bob Corker and Pat Toomey developed a bill that would give Congress approval on all national security tariffs.\n\nRepublican Senate Finance Committe Chair Orrin Hatch also warned Trump in a speech Tuesday that legislation may be necessary unless the president reverses course.\n\n\"If the administration continues forward with its misguided and reckless reliance on tariffs, I will work to advance trade legislation to curtail presidential trade authority,\" Hatch said.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, meanwhile, a group of 149 bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging against the tariffs.", "Apple is continuing to increase the number of autonomous vehicles it has on the roads for testing, reportedly registering more vehicles with the Californian Department of Motor Vehicles to bring the fleet up to 66 self-driving cars operating in the state.\n\nIn a recent filing with the state DMV spotted by Macreports, the 66 cars being used by Apple are being controlled by 111 registered drivers. This is an increase in both vehicles and drivers since May 14, when Apple had 55 test vehicles and 83 authorized drivers.\n\nThe increases suggest Apple is adding more vehicles to the fleet at a steady rate. The previous update on March 20 claimed there to be 45 Apple-owned self-driving cars, which would put Apple at introducing roughly ten more cars to the collection every two months.\n\nDespite the increases, Apple still does not operate the most autonomous test vehicles in the state. California's records indicate Apple's fleet to be the third-largest, behind the 117 cars and 333 drivers for GM Cruise, as well as the 72 cars and 411 drivers of Waymo. Tesla has 39 cars and 92 registered drivers in its own project.\n\nCalifornia has issued 56 autonomous vehicle testing permits, with 468 approved vehicles operated by 1,677 approved drivers. Notably, Apple has yet to apply for a driverless car permit from the DMV, suggesting it would prefer to continue with driver-assisted testing for the moment.\n\nWorked on under the \"Project Titan\" name, Apple's autonomous vehicle technology was originally thought to be part of a branded car, but the focus reportedly changed to just the self-driving vehicle system in late 2016. It is unclear what the current goal for Apple's work is, but it is thought to be the autonomous platform itself rather than an entire vehicle, with the potential of partnering with an outside firm to create a ridehailing service.\n\nA connected self-driving project intending to shuttle company employees between facilities was reported in May to use Volkswagon T6 Transporter vans, after attempts to negotiate with BMW to work on the project allegedly failed. Running from Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the PAIL program will include specialized dashboards, seats, and extensive modifications made to the vehicles, and will still be operated by a back-up driver and co-pilot, in case the self-driving element fails.\n\nApple is also expanding the self-driving car team with senior Waymo engineer and NASA JPL engineer Jamie Waydo, who was responsible for checking the safety of prototype vehicles and coaching the autonomous competitor ahead of real-world road tests in Phoenix. Before Waymo, Waydo's time at NASA included working on one of the agency's Mars rovers.\n\nProject Titan has also been the subject of attempted trade secret theft, with one former Apple employee entering a plea of not guilty on July 16, after being accused of stealing a 25-page detailed schematic of a circuit board intended for use in an autonomous vehicle.", "Crooks broke into property before stealing keys to black BMW parked outside\n\nGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nThe owner of a BMW was injured as he tried to stop thieves making off with his car in the early hours.\n\nCriminals forced their way into a house on Summertrees Road, Great Sutton, at 1.30am this morning (Wednesday, July 18) and stole keys to the black BMW.\n\nA male occupant heard the offenders and attempted to stop them driving off with his car but the burglars managed to escape.\n\nPolice say the car hit the victim during the incident and he suffered minor injuries to his feet and back but did not require hospital treatment.\n\nDetectives are now appealing for witnesses\n\nAll three offenders were described as wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered with scarves and baseball caps.\n\nDetective Constable Paul Munnerley, of Ellesmere Port CID, said: \"While we conduct a number of lines of enquiry I am appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious behaviour in the area to call police on 101.\"\n\nAnyone with any information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 127173, or Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.", "A British tourist has been shot in the buttocks in a Benidorm nightclub after getting caught up in a suspected gangland shooting that also saw a Moroccan 'drug dealer' wounded.\n\nTerrified British tourists were forced to flee from bars on the Spanish resort's main strip, Calle Mallorca, amid reports of a shooting outside the Hippodrome disco-pub.\n\nA 42-year-old Briton, thought to be an innocent holidaymaker, was injured in the attack in an area known as Little England at 11pm last night.\n\nLocal sources say the shooting of a Moroccan, who was left with superficial wounds, was linked to the sale of drugs in the area.

The male's radiating tail fan is one of nature's gaudy splendours.\n\nBrar, 42, lives on a corner of the well-to-do and ethnically diverse Sullivan Heights neighbourhood of Surrey. It's been a favourite hangout since the late 1970s for an increasingly large muster of feral peafowl. (The males, which sport the psychedelic tail plumage, are properly called peacocks; the duller-looking females are peahens.)\n\nIn particular, the peafowl -- sometimes 30 or more of them -- roosted for years in a tall Douglas fir tucked into a corner of Brar's backyard, just metres from one of his children's bedroom window.\n\nREAD: The pandas are going to the Calgary Zoo. How safe will they be?\n\nBrar bought his house seven years ago, when his daughter was two. \"I hardly remember her ever playing in our backyard because you constantly clean the [peafowl] poop.\" A shipper/receiver for a liquor distribution company, Brar gets up at 4:05 a.m. for work. The peafowl's shrill, haunting calls give the neighbourhood the auditory feeling of a jungle. \"When it's mating season, they drive you nuts,\" says Brar. \"You get less and less sleep\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I couldn't handle this anymore.\"\n\nOn April 29, Brar, having repeatedly but fruitlessly begged the city of Surrey for help since 2016, took matters into his own hands. He cut down his Douglas fir -- even though the city previously denied his request for a tree-cutting permit. That act resulted in a $1,000 fine for taking down the tree without a permit. The city is now taking Brar to court in an effort to increase the fine, says Jas Rehal, manager of public safety operations for the city of Surrey. The maximum fine is $10,000.\n\nBrar's desperate act also reawakened long-simmering differences in attitude toward the birds, which were raised by a farmer in the area decades ago when the neighbourhood was mostly farmland. When that farmer sold to developers, local lore goes, he left some peafowl behind.\n\nOn a neighbourhood Facebook group called Nosey Neighbours, Brar has been called an \"idiot,\" a \"scumbag\" and worse for his anti-peafowl action. \"They were tearing me down on that Facebook page,\" he says, exasperated.\n\nCindy Dalglish admits she was among those who came out against Brar \"with guns blazing.\" But after a local media report detailed Brar's long effort to get help from Surrey officials, Dalglish, 43, had a change of heart. \"I didn't know how it was impacting residents here.\" In apology, she took a box of Girl Guide cookies to Brar and publicly retracted her criticism of those calling on city council for a peafowl purge.\n\nDalglish, who lives a bit further away from the peafowl epicentre, met with Brar and other affected residents. \"It opened my eyes to, yes, the peacocks are beautiful when they are just standing there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but the negative impact to our neighbourhood is far greater than their beauty.\"\n\nOn June 25, after what some residents say was years of dithering, Surrey city council voted unanimously to live-trap and humanely remove peacocks from Sullivan Heights. The city, acknowledging in a report that it's been getting peafowl complaints since 2010, plans to relocate the birds first to the Surrey Animal Resource Centre. Then they'll be adopted by zoos, sanctuaries, farms and other appropriate locations where they are wanted.\n\nMORE: How a stressed woman found solace through looking at birds\n\nIn a report to city council, Rehal wrote that a residential neighbourhood is an inappropriate place for peafowl, and that \"tensions continue to rise in the area, and staff receive a high amount of daily calls, emails and complaints.\"\n\nAmong their avian transgressions, the males tend to peck at their own reflections on the sides of cars, perceiving the images as competition for peahen love. One resident pointed to beak scuffs on the side of his grey Toyota Corolla. The beaked vandals prefer darker cars, but they aren't picky about model; over the years, they've scratched up BMWs and Mercedes, too, causing thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nFor Brar, the relocation plan feels too late for him. If the city had acted sooner, he says, \"the tree would have been still there. I would have the same image in the neighbourhood.\"\n\nMany locals, including Ryan Cragg, point to one house as the focal point of the problem. It has a warming shelter, feeding trough and water source for the peafowl, he says. On a recent visit to the neighbourhood, cages, peahens and at least a dozen chicks could be seen in the yard. (The owner, who's clearly on the side of the peacocks, couldn't be reached for comment.)\n\nPeacocks become a disturbance to some residents in a Surrey Neighbourhood. (Photograph by Jen Osborne)\n\nCragg, 44, a software technology trainer, admits he's \"plinked\" at peafowl in trees near his home with plastic BBs from an Airsoft gun when they vocalize at annoying hours. When they do, he says, \"it sounds like someone is being killed.\"\n\nJerry Barr, who lives on 62nd Avenue in the peafowled neighbourhood, professes himself a friend of the birds. \"I'm easygoing with them. We knew what we were getting into when we bought the property [in 2009].\" He ridicules the city's estimate that about 100 peafowl populate Sullivan Heights, insisting the number is between 30 and 40 at most.\n\nWith a decision at last, it's still unclear when the human squawking in Sullivan Heights might subside. Many residents, says Dalglish, are now miffed that the city failed to consult with the community first, as promised, before voting on the new action plan.\n\nThe city promised an information night July 12 to inform the community how it will remove the peafowl from Sullivan Heights.\n\nClearly, it won't be easy. After his department consulted other cities with a similar problem, including Longboat Key, Fla., and Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Rehal wrote in his report to city council that both jurisdictions failed to catch all their peafowl. With each hen laying clutches of three to eight eggs annually, escapees can quickly repopulate an area.\n\nAnd there's a suggestion that some peafowl fans and activists will foul relocation efforts by tampering with traps and releasing birds themselves.\n\nNevertheless, Cragg maintains he and some neighbours will get traps from the city as soon as possible for their properties, though he admits sabotage is a worry. And though he'd prefer peace reign in Sullivan Heights as peafowl are taken away, he expects he'll get some strong backlash for being among those who pushed Surrey officials to finally act.\n\n\"But ultimately,\" he says, \"having the birds gone will improve my quality of life enough that I don't really care what those who put peacocks ahead of people think.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT WILDLIFE: The story of the lost leatherback turtle of East Bay, N.S.

Such a move would represent a massive escalation of Trump's tariffs on the EU and likely push the two sides into a full-on trade war.\n\nWhile Trump has been critical of auto imports throughout his presidency, the president announced in May that the US would launch an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. That end result could be more tariffs - and likely economic turmoil.\n\nTrump has directly threatened to impose a tariff of 20% on auto imports from the EU to the US.\n\n\"Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the US and its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the US,\" Trump tweeted. \"Build them here!\"\n\nMany European automakers, including brands like BMW and Mercedes, already produce cars at plants in the US.\n\nAny tariffs on vehicles would be a massive escalation in the trade fight between the EU and US.

He doesn't consider this a coincidence. In the last decade, the pair have collaborated on six movies (three with McQuarrie as director), and each time they've found a new reason to push their ambitions -- as well as push new stunts that sometimes can include Cruise dangling from the side of a plane or, in the case of this month's Mission: Impossible - Fallout, jumping out of one at 25,000 feet. Over 100 times.\n\nNoting that the strongest steel goes through the hottest fire, McQuarrie says, \"Every movie is a crucible that reveals people's creative priorities and, very often, their true nature. From the moment we met, Tom and I recognized someone with the same basic creative priorities. When you find people you're that in sync with, you hold onto them and make another movie.\"\n\nHence why McQuarrie is the first director to sign up for a second go in Cruise's signature franchise, Mission: Impossible. Ever since John Woo stepped in for Brian De Palma on a radically reimagined M:I2, the series has been a Rorschach test, allowing each filmmaker to bring their own energy and vision to the franchise. Yet McQuarrie, fresh off the best-reviewed entry in the saga, 2015's Rogue Nation, ended that unspoken rule by accepting a follow-up Mission.\n\n\"I doubt I'm the first director asked to come back,\" McQuarrie demurs. \"I'm certain I'm the first one crazy enough to say yes.\" Be that as it may, the veteran filmmaker, whose writing credits include The Usual Suspects and Edge of Tomorrow, doesn't consider Fallout to be a direct sequel to the previous entry, even if it is the first M:I film to retain most of the same team and supporting cast.\n\n\"Rogue Nation was a very challenging movie to make,\" the writer-director says. \"When it worked, I had a strong urge to walk away from the table with my winnings... Tom urged me to come back, and I agreed with the understanding that I would not attempt to play on the success of Rogue Nation the way Rogue had played on Ghost Protocol.\"\n\nThe result is a film which McQuarrie and his crew repeatedly emphasize is more humanistic and intimate, derived from the perspective of its characters. There are, of course, always a few rules that must be preserved: the mission dossier self-destructs; there is a mask, at some point; and Cruise's Ethan Hunt is no daredevil (the actor, in fact, needs to look more scared doing the stunts than he would be off-screen). But everything else is fair game. That includes deconstructing why Ethan Hunt is considered \"a gambler.\" McQuarrie suggests the films are really about everyone else speculating what makes him take risks, and Fallout is intended to answer that question by contextualizing his deepest regrets and fears -- and by revisiting aspects of his character once thought buried.\n\nRead the Den of Geek SDCC 2018 Special Edition Magazine Here!\n\n\"Tom very much wanted to resolve the story of Julia, which people still ask him about,\" McQuarrie says, referring to the return of Michelle Monaghan as Ethan's ex-wife. \"We thought that had been wrapped up nicely in Ghost Protocol, but apparently it wasn't definitive enough.\" Which also meant reintroducing her like a new character, and finally making Monaghan as integral to the on-screen crew as Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust and franchise stalwarts Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. Still, the trick is keeping the family together while throwing them into harrowing, character-driven action -- even when that action doesn't draw solely from the script.\n\nIndeed, Fallout is the first film in McQuarrie's career where the demands of the locations and stunts dictated what the actual stunts would be. For the helmer, this is borne out of the realization that most of the time when scenes didn't turn out the way he'd written them, it was because of a \"shitty location.\" The epiphany has in turn allowed his crew extraordinary freedom to fine-tune the picture's aesthetic. Stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood, for one, felt liberated by how he could simply walk down the streets of Paris and let the cobblestones inform the type of car Ethan Hunt would drive while in pursuit. (It's a classic BMW M5.)\n\n\"It drove the color of the car, the green of the car against the gray cobblestone,\" Eastwood marvels. \"Everything came alive before we thought about where we are going to slide and crash.\" Nonetheless, sliding and crashing is the name of the game.\n\nEastwood is also a longtime member of Cruise's off-screen IMF team, even occasionally sharing adventurous weekends away from the set with the star.\n\n\"If we have a laugh, we don't go away and sit on the beach,\" Eastwood says with his own bemusement. \"We race cars and bikes, we skydive, we fly choppers.\" All of which eventually disseminates into the series, including Fallout's action triumvirate electing to have Cruise HALO jump out of a military plane in the UAE. (There's too much red tape in the UK.) It's the first time an actor has done the high-altitude dive himself, and Cruise did it for more than 100 takes. After practice runs.\n\nThe old way of doing things is something all three men value, even if the tradeoff features downsides.\n\n\"Ninety percent of the shots you'll see of Tom running in Fallout, he's doing so on a broken [foot],\" McQuarrie recalls. It was the result of one of the simpler stunts (by their standards), which had Cruise leaping between buildings. Eastwood notes Cruise rehearsed it fine, but with the camera rolling, and as Ethan Hunt, a focus on the character's excitement led to Cruise overextending his foot. Afterward, he continued doing his own stunts, with five hours of physical therapy every day. Eastwood even supervised Cruise doing physio on a bike before each take, so that the blood in his foot would warm.\n\n\"Every time [we] paused camera, he literally hobbled back to the number one position and would have physio. It was only pure adrenaline and the desire to finish the film that made him run in the shot.\" That, plus a desire to give moviegoers a throwback to real action spectacle.", "Apple is continuing to expand its testing of autonomous vehicles. According to new details from macReports, the company now has upwards of 65 autonomous vehicles on the road in California, continuing the gradual increase that has been taking place over recent months...\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nThis information comes from records filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Apple is still not the most prolific tester of autonomous vehicles in the state, with GM Cruise leading the way at 117 cars with 333 drivers. Waymo is in second with some 72 cars and 411 drivers.\n\nApple comes in next with 66 cars and 111 drivers. While the company is testing autonomous vehicles in California, it does not yet hold a driverless car permit. This means that there is still someone behind the wheel overseeing the testing of the cars at this point.\n\nApple's rise to 66 autonomous vehicles comes as it has gradually expanded its fleet in California. For instance, in May, the company had just over 50 self-driving cars on the road in California.\n\nWhile Apple lags behind companies such as GM Cruise and Waymo, it still has a sizable lead on Tesla and other companies, such as Toyota.\n\nApple's end goal with its autonomous testing is still unclear. In May, it was reported that Apple reached a self-driving car deal with Volkswagen. Under this agreement, the company plans to turn Volkswagen's T6 Transport van into self-driving shuttles for its employees.\n\nAs time progresses, it's likely that Apple will continue to expand its self-driving testing in California and around the country, especially as its partnership with Volkswagen ramps up.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nReport: After failed talks w/ Mercedes & BMW, Apple reaches self-driving car deal with Volkswagen Apple now has over 50 self-driving cars on the road in California, expanding autonomous testing FT: Apple ramping self-driving car testing, more CA permits than Tesla and Uber\n\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:", "Through its ReachNow mobility unit, BMW is offering both ride and car sharing services through a single app, allowing users to choose whether they want to drive a car or hail a ride to a destination.

The \"Drive\" portion of the software provides free-floating car sharing allowing users to drive themselves to their destinations. The \"Ride\" portion of the app resembles other ride hailing services.\n\nShared fleet\n\nBMW says that using the same cars in a sharing app will lead to greater utilization of the existing fleet rather than adding new vehicles to the road. \"For mobility services, a key metric is the number of trips a member takes with a service,\" says Dr. Bernhard Bl\u00e4ttel, Vice President Mobility Services BMW Group. \"ReachNow's multimodal service offering gives members more choice in how they get where they need to be by seamlessly integrating multiple services into one app. We believe this approach is critical to increasing loyalty, as members have no need to look elsewhere for their mobility needs.\"\n\nIf members choose the drive app, they can select from BMW, BMW i and Mini vehicles in the ReachNow fleet and pay by the minute, hour or the day. They can schedule a vehicle pickup as soon as 20 minutes or up to 7 days in advance. Once a car is held, the destination is set on the in-car navigation. Members can also engage features like \"Park & Keep\" if they have additional need for the vehicle or \"End Trip.\" Rates vary from 45 cents per minute, $15 for the first hour, $50 for three hours and $80 per day. Parking time is billed at 10 cents per minute during paused trips.\n\nRiders can also use the app to personalize the comfort by selecting temperature and music preferences of their hailed ride as well as a \"quiet time\" feature for those who do not want to be disturbed during their trip. Existing members who have the ReachNow mobility app can upgrade to the new Ride services by doing an update and new members can waive the $15 sign-up fee. ReachNow Ride pricing starts at $3.24 minimum per ride incurred at $2.40 per mile plus 40 cents per minute with no surge pricing. BMW will also be testing the Drive only portion of the app in New York City and Portland, Oregon."]}, "Telefonica": {"2018-07-18": ["Wednesday, July 18, 2018\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Netflix (NFLX), Eli Lilly (LLY) and BNY Mellon (BK). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nNetflix's shares have increased +97.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's gain of +33.5% during the same period. Netflix's second-quarter 2018 subscriber addition rate was disappointing.\n\nAlthough management cited over-optimistic guidance, the Zacks analyst thinks the pace of subscriber additions has hit a rough patch due to increasing competition. Nevertheless, Netflix's focus on providing quality content, expanding original movie slate, strong regional content portfolio and aggressive spending is expected to help it steer away competition.\n\nMoreover, partnerships with telcos like Telefonica in Spain and Latin America as well as KDDI in Japan are expected to boost subscriber addition. However, the company's increasing marketing spends and higher investments on content will hurt profitability, unless subscriber addition rebounds. Further, strengthening U.S. dollar doesn't bode well for operating margin expansion. Cash burn is also expected to continue in the near term.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>).\n\nShares of Buy-ranked Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date (+6.1% vs. -0.7%). Lilly's new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo have been driving revenues and the trend is expected to continue in 2018. Lilly expects to launch 20 new products by 2023, including at least two new indications/line extensions on an average every year.\n\nThe Zacks analyst thinks the decision to sell or spin-off the Animal Health segment, which has underperformed lately, is a prudent decision. However, competitive pressure on Lilly's drugs is expected to rise this year. Challenges remain for the company in the form of upcoming loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron.\n\nU.S. pricing access pressure will also remain a headwind in 2018. Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of the Q2 earnings release. Lilly has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>).\n\nBNY Mellon's shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months (-4.6% vs. -7.2%). Also, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters. The Zacks analyst thinks higher interest rates, loan growth and improving fee income will aid revenue growth.\n\nLesser regulations, tax cuts and cost-saving initiatives are likely to continue driving profitability. Further, enhanced capital deployment plan reflects a strong balance sheet. However, concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee-based income remains a matter of concern.\n\nIf there is any change in individual investment preferences, regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities, it might hamper the company's financials. Also, earnings estimate has moved lower ahead of the company's second quarter results.\n\n(You can read the full research report on BNY Mellon here >>>).\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Stryker (SYK), TJX Companies (TJX) and Raytheon (RTN).\n\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\n\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Find out how to contact him below.\n\nD.H. writes: Last May I entered into a contract with claims company Action Direct (UK) Limited to determine whether I had a claim for payment protection insurance compensation.\n\nSeveral weeks later the company called requesting information about the lender, Abbey National, which I was unable to supply.\n\nI had no more contact until recently when I was called by an Action Direct representative.\n\nBan: The Ministry of Justice took steps against Action Direct (UK) Limited\n\nI said I had heard nothing for more than six months and considered the matter closed. He asked if I wanted to cancel the agreement and, thinking this was a mutual closure, I agreed.\n\nThen I received a further call saying that because I cancelled, I owed \u00a3400 for work completed.\n\nI asked what work and was told Action Direct was not obliged to tell me. If I did not pay, I would be taken to court.\n\nTony replies: Action Direct (UK) Limited is licensed as a claims management company. But in 2011 the Ministry of Justice carried out an investigation into its conduct and banned it from taking on any more employment claims work and from representing customers before any employment tribunal or similar body.\n\nIt is still authorised to handle payment protection insurance claims.\n\nThe company is based at Bridgend in South Wales, but Companies House filings show it is owned by Fields Holdings Limited which is controlled by Bridgend businessman Jamie Hamilton Wallis.\n\nHe was a director of Action Direct when the Ministry of Justice imposed its ban and he stepped down soon afterwards.\n\nThe sole director of Action Direct is Natalie Ferry. I repeatedly invited her to comment on what you told me. Just as repeatedly, she did not respond.\n\nA comment did come from an assistant at the company. She would not say whether she holds any position at Action Direct but claimed she had the authority to speak for Ferry.\n\nShe told me: 'Mr H agreed to be bound by our terms when he signed and returned our documentation.\n\n'Our terms it [sic] clearly state the fees that shall be applicable if the client wishes to cancel after the initial 14 day cancellation period.'\n\nThe assistant refused to say what work Action Direct had carried out. You have told me the company rang you up and asked for details of a loan you had many years ago.\n\nYou explained that you no longer had the details. That is it. If Action Direct did anything more, then it is not saying so.\n\nI believe Action Direct's threat to sue you is a cruel bluff. You were steered over the phone into cancelling the agreement - and you are now being steered into handing over \u00a3400. But for what?\n\nAction Direct's contract says: 'If we do not recover you anything, you do not pay us anything.'\n\nThe \u00a3400 demand you received is not legally a demand at all. It is a 'pro forma invoice'.\n\nThis is a document used in some trades to show a price before goods or services are provided. It is not a legal invoice and not a demand for payment. Let us see Action Direct try to enforce that in court.\n\nThe mysterious assistant wants you to contact Action Direct 'to try and reach a satisfactory remedy'.\n\nShe is upset that you contacted The Mail on Sunday. Frankly, I would ignore her.\n\nYou have given me copies of complaints you sent to the company before you contacted me. All she need do is reply to them.\n\nBut if you receive any more threats or demands, let me know - and perhaps the claims management regulator might be interested too.\n\nMobile phone giant was going to charge for its billing clanger\n\nI.B. writes: A text message from O2 advised that my regular mobile phone bill credit card payment had been rejected. If I did not settle the bill within four days I would face a late payment fee.\n\nI called O2 and paid the bill but I also called my card company and was told no previous charge had been made against my card and no charge had been rejected.\n\nThe card company said it had been inundated with similar enquiries.\n\nText shock: O2 mobile phone users faced card payment fault\n\nO2 and its parent company Telefonica confirmed to me you always pay your monthly phone bill in full, by way of a continuous authority to charge the bill to your credit card.\n\nI was told: 'We sent our payment request for Mr B's bill as normal but unfortunately this was not processed correctly.\n\nAs a result, this triggered the text message Mr B received regarding a late payment. The issue has since been fixed'.\n\nO2 did not tell me who slipped up, or how, but it did explain: 'We have been working with our payment solutions partner who process our continuous card payments as part of our investigation.'\n\nThis suggests that O2 billed you correctly but an outside contractor failed to charge your card.\n\nO2 has apologised and credited your account with \u00a325 for the inconvenience. I hope lots of O2 customers did not receive similar texts or pay the penalty fee.\n\nI'm a pensioner, but Revenue demanded \u00a314k corporation tax\n\nN.M. writes: I am sending you a letter from Revenue & Customs, delivered by hand to my home while I was on holiday.\n\nThe letter demands more than \u00a314,000 in corporation tax. My initial reaction was this was a hoax as the letter is addressed to a limited company and not to me.\n\nBut the Revenue confirmed it is genuine and says it has information that the company's director resided at my address.\n\nI can understand your concern. The letter is not just a demand for more than \u00a314,000. It is headed: 'Warning of enforcement action.'\n\nIt begins: 'I called today to collect payment of the above amount or to determine your assets for sale at auction.'\n\nNot unreasonably, you have been afraid that Revenue officials or bailiffs will now turn up on your doorstep and try to seize your furniture, car and any personal belongings that could be sold to cover the tax bill.\n\nYet you have lived at the same address since 2004, you are 70 years old and retired and you have never heard of the construction company named in the Revenue's demand. There is also the small legal point that an individual should not be pursued for the debts of a limited company.\n\nIt took me around ten minutes to cross-check Companies House records and the electoral register. I found the real address of the director whose company owes all this money.\n\nI asked staff at Revenue headquarters to see whether anyone misused your address and nobody has. Rather, it was a clerical error by tax office staff. Your address has now been removed from its records and you have received an official apology.\n\nI flagged up ID theft and was hit by a penalty fee\n\nJ.W. writes: A Barclaycard was taken out fraudulently in my name. The first indication I had was a demand for a late payment fee of \u00a312.\n\nI reported this to the fraud department at Barclaycard and asked for the account to be closed. But they sent me a replacement card.\n\nI cut it up and sent it back, but I still receive demands.\n\nScam: A Barclaycard was taken out fraudulently in my name\n\nThis was an unsuccessful fraud by whoever applied for the card in your name. The card was used just twice, running up a bill of \u00a316. Barclaycard accepted that the card was not yours.\n\nIt cancelled the balance due but failed to scrap the interest and penalty fees, which grew to \u00a348. You even had an adverse entry placed on your credit file showing you were in arrears.\n\nA Barclaycard official told me: 'We are sorry Mr W's account was not immediately cleared and for the confusion this has caused.'\n\nThe fees have been scrapped, your credit file has been cleaned up and by the time you read this you should have received \u00a350 from Barclaycard as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.

Modifying this online account ID referenced in the URL meant a users could then access other users' account data.\n\nFACUA, a Spanish non-profit that specialises in consumer rights protection, held a press conference and went public about the flaw on Monday.\n\nThe bug has been resolved at this point, hours after it was reported to Telefonica on Sunday, which is just as well because it was a real howler, as illustrated by the video below.\n\nYoutube Video\n\nCustomers of Movistar's landline, broadband, and television service were all at potential risk from the security breach, which came to light after a Movistar user reported it to FACUA.\n\nIt's unclear whether or not the security slip-up has actually been exploited by miscreants to harvest users' personal details. El Reg approached Telefonica/Movistar for comment via both email and Twitter but we're yet to hear back. We'll update this story as and when more information comes to hand.\n\nFACUA has reportedly filed a complaint against Telefonica Spain and Telefonica Mobile with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD). \u00ae\n\nThis type of flaw is technically known as a Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), a basic problem on poorly designed web applications that has been known about for many years but still crops up more than occasionally.", "This article is part of our special report What's driving Europe's strategy on connected cars?.\n\nPressure is mounting on the European Commission ahead of a decision it is expected to announce this autumn that will affect how internet-connected cars are built in Europe.\n\nCar companies, telecoms operators, tech manufacturers and European national governments are nervous about the action and argue it could leave a lasting mark on what kind of technology is built into new cars, which will be outfitted with an increasing amount of internet-based functions in the coming years.\n\nAt the heart of the disagreement is whether a technical policy decision within the Commission could lend support to a short-range, Wifi-based system that is already available for use -- or to the cellular, longer-range technology known as C-V2X, which is seen as a precursor to 5G networks.\n\nEuropean governments have pledged to make the fast next-generation mobile technology ready for commercial use by 2025.\n\nWhat has largely remained a niche policy squabble over technical standards in recent months seems to have reached a boiling point now, just before Brussels quiets down for summer recess.\n\nSupporters of the cellular technology argue that a Commission announcement favouring the Wifi-based vehicle-to-vehicle option could be a barrier to the EU's goals to introduce 5G within a few years.\n\n\"We believe it will have an impact on the rollout of 5G in Europe and it will be not a positive one. It will be negative,\" Uwe Puetzschler, the head of Nokia's digital-focused programme Car2x told a Brussels gathering of industry groups and EU officials last week.\n\nLobbyists have lined up to warn the Commission that the decision could chill companies' investment plans to build the expensive infrastructure needed to support 5G.\n\nThose networks will cost around \u20ac500 billion to build, according to Commission estimates, but telecoms companies argue the figure is actually much higher. They have warned officials in Brussels that they may be less likely to open their pockets to invest in new infrastructure without strong business cases -- like the possibility of having cars across Europe run on cellular technology.\n\nSo far, the Commission has insisted it will not side with either C-V2X or the Wifi-based V2V option. But early drafts of the legislative proposed expected out later this year, which EURACTIV has obtained, include details indicating how a radio spectrum band will be used by V2V -- but the document contains no reference to the cellular technology.\n\nThe debate has pitted some carmakers against telecoms companies. A handful of car manufacturers have announced plans to invest more money into building vehicles with the Wifi-based technology. They argue that the V2V option is an easier choice because it is already available, and because it will make safety features more precise.\n\nBut the lobby in favour of cellular technology is becoming increasingly concerned as the Commission announcement comes closer. An alliance of CEOs from 15 tech companies, telecoms operators and car manufacturers warned Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month that the planned legislation will hamper Europe's goals to roll out 5G networks within the next few years.\n\n\"Despite the European Commission's stated commitment to technology neutrality, we are very concerned about the progressing Delegated Act. At the current time, it rules out the most recent technology, Cellular-V2X (C-V2X), favouring a specific and single-purpose Wifi-based technology path (known as ITS-G5), thus precluding the evolution to 5G for connected cars,\" said the executives' letter, seen by EURACTIV.\n\nIt was signed by the CEOs of BMW, Daimler, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, Ford, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, PSA, Telefonica, Samsung, software firm Savari, Chinese manufacturer Saic Motor, Qualcomm and Vodafone.\n\nThe executives urged Juncker to remove language from the bill that limits what technology carmakers will be able to use to build internet-connected vehicles. They also said that the current draft would make it hard for European companies to compete with US and China-based firms, where the national governments have taken actions to make way for 5G use in new internet-connected cars.\n\n\"Such a decision would stunt the overall emergence of 5G connectivity infrastructure in Europe, and run counter to the objectives of the Commission's own 5G action plan, which aims to promote early deployment of 5G along major transport paths. A de-facto ITS-G5 mandate will mean that the transportation and telecommunication industries have much less incentive to invest in 5G for automotive and to provide 5G coverage alongside road corridors,\" the letter said.\n\nNational governments also divided over the issue\n\nA handful of countries are hitting back against the Commission's draft proposal. EURACTIV previously reported on blistering comments that the Finnish and Spanish transport ministries sent to the EU executive criticising its plans to lock in Wifi as the only option that carmakers could use to build vehicles with high-tech features like internet-connected automatic braking or smart entertainment systems.\n\nAnother big and important country also recently weighed in on the debate.\n\nAn official in the German economy ministry sent an 11-page position paper on 4 July backing the Wifi option. A personal letter sent with the paper was addressed to the German Association of the Automotive Industry VDA, the main lobby group for the country's powerful auto sector.\n\n\"The upcoming implementation of V2X systems must use the technology that is available now on the market. Currently, only ITS-G5 is available. As a result, the corresponding infrastructure uses this technology,\" the German paper said.\n\nThe text referred to V2X, meaning vehicles that connect to everything, including other cars and road infrastructure. ITS-G5 is the short-range Wifi technology.\n\nHowever, even the German industry is divided. Two of the country's biggest car companies, BMW and Daimler, signed the critical letter to Juncker asking for the Commission to change track and move away from its plans to side with the V2V Wifi-based option.\n\nAt the Brussels gathering of industry groups pushing for the cellular CV2-X technology last week, Eddy Hartog, the high-level official in charge of smart mobility at the Commission's technology policy directorate DG Connect, insisted that the EU executive would stick to a neutral position and refrain from backing one option over the other. But he acknowledged that the debate had heated up.\n\nHartog, speaking after a lineup of industry representatives in favour of the 5G option, described their presentations as \"a little bit of a beauty contest\".", "Google is investing in its second private transatlantic cable * Called Dunant, the system will connect Virginia Beach in the US to the west coast of France * The cable will boost bandwidth between Google's rapidly growing data center cluster in Northern Virginia and its data center campus in St. Ghislain, Belgium\n\nGoogle is investing in a second transcontinental cable all its own.\n\nThe Dunant system, named after Red Cross founder and the first Nobel Peace Prize winner Henri Dunant, will connect a cable landing station in Virginia Beach - close to where Google is building a huge amount of cloud data center capacity - to a landing station somewhere along France's west coast, relatively close to its data centers in Belgium.\n\nRelated: Facebook Invests in US-Hong Kong Submarine Cable\n\nManufactured and laid by TE SubCom, the cable will further boost the amount of bandwidth on the Alphabet subsidiary's global private network, which likely already is the biggest of its kind in the world (the company claims that it is).\n\nAlphabet/Google\n\nThe map of Google's global network, July 2018\n\nRelated: Amazon's Cloud Arm Makes Its First Big Submarine Cable Investment\n\nLaying a transcontinental submarine cable is a massive infrastructure project that typically costs hundreds of millions of dollars and takes years to complete. For that reason, companies doing business online have traditionally bought capacity on existing cables built by consortia of telecommunications companies.\n\nIn recent years, however, global bandwidth demand on the networks operated by the likes of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has grown so much that the companies have found it makes financial sense in some cases to either join cable consortia together with telcos or finance their own systems.\n\nIn a blog post announcing the Dunant project, Jayne Stowell, a strategic negotiator at Google, highlighted three factors the company takes into consideration when deciding whether to buy bandwidth on someone else's cable, join a consortium as an investor, or build on its own:\n\nPerformance and latency: Cables are often built to serve a very specific route. When we build privately, we can choose this route based on what will provide the lowest latency for the largest segment of customers. In this case, we wanted connectivity across the Atlantic that was close to certain data centers, but the reasons could also include the ability to land in certain countries, or to connect two places that were previously underserved, such as was the case with Curie.\n\nCapacity: The bandwidth that we want to deliver can vary widely, depending on what already exists and where our customers need more, now and in the future. Our capacity planning includes estimates of Google's and our customers' needs for years to come.\n\nGuaranteed bandwidth for the lifetime of the cable: The life of a cable can vary from 15 to 25 years, but as with many infrastructure projects, they sometimes continue to serve the route beyond their initial projected lifespan. Our ability to guarantee our customers a certain level of connectivity helps them confidently plan for their businesses going forward.\n\nHere's the full list of submarine cable projects Google has either been involved in funding or funded on its own, as of this writing:\n\nAlphabet/Google\n\nGoogle submarine cable investments, July 2018\n\nThe first cable being built solely on Google's buck is Curie, announced in January. Scheduled to light up sometime next year, it will connect Chile, where the company has a large concentration of its Latin American data center capacity, and Los Angeles, where a new three-data center Google Cloud availability region came online just this week.\n\nVirginia Beach is a recent addition to the global map of network infrastructure. Last year, the southeastern Virginia city became home to a landing station for Marea, the highest-capacity cable to ever cross the Atlantic, financed by Facebook, Microsoft, and Telxius (subsidiary of the Spanish telco Telef\u00f3nica). Marea's other landing is in Bilbao, Spain.\n\nRun Studios/Microsoft\n\nMarea submarine cable running into the ocean in Virginia Beach, Virginia\n\nWith Marea's launch, Virginia Beach became an alternative East Coast cable landing location to New York and New Jersey, where the bulk of transatlantic connectivity currently terminates. Not far from all those landing points is Northern Virginia, the region with the highest concentration of data centers in the US and possibly in the world.\n\nRecently, Google - like other cloud giants - has been expanding its data center footprint in Northern Virginia. After having operated some data center capacity supporting its consumer products like search and email in the area for years, the company last year launched its first cloud availability region in there. Later in the year, it bought two parcels of land in the area to build more data centers.\n\nThe Dunant cable will undoubtedly move data coming in and out of the company's Northern Virginia data center cluster. In his blog post, Stowell said one of the reasons the company chose to fund this cable on its own was that \"we wanted connectivity across the Atlantic that was close to certain data centers.\"\n\nThe company hasn't disclosed where exactly on the French west coast the cable will land, but it did say that the cable will ultimately carry traffic in and out of the Google Cloud availability region in St. Ghislain, Belgium.", "Changing official team sponsors for the 2019 MotoGP season is Yamaha MotoGP Team, switching from Spaish telecommunications company Movistar, owned by Telefonica, to energy drinks brand Monster Energy.

However the technology faces major safety and regulatory hurdles that are clouding its future in the sector.\n\nSnam and EDF's network subsidiary RTE have tested prototypes of long-distance drones that fly at low altitudes over pipelines and power lines.\n\nItaly's Snam, Europe's biggest gas utility, told Reuters it is trialling one of these machines - known as BVLOS drones because they fly 'beyond the visual line of sight' of operators in the Apennine hills around Genoa. It hopes to have it scouting a 20 km stretch of pipeline soon.\n\nFrance's RTE has also tested a long-distance drone, which flew about 50 km inspecting transmission lines and sent back data that allowed technicians to virtually model a section of the grid. The company said it would invest 4.8 million euros ($5.6 million) on drone technology over the next two years.\n\nAt present, power companies largely use helicopters equipped with cameras to inspect their networks. They have also recently started occasionally using more basic drones that stay within sight of controllers and have a range of only about 500 metres.\n\nHowever an industry-wide shift towards renewable energy, and the need to monitor the myriad extra connections needed to link solar and wind parks to grids, is forcing utilities to look at the advanced technology.\n\n\"It's a real game changer,\" Michal Mazur, partner at consultancy PwC, said of drones. \"They're 100 times faster than manual measurement, more accurate than helicopters and, with AI devices on board, could soon be able to fix problems.\"\n\nIn-sight drones cost around 20,000 euros each and BVLOS ones will cost significantly more, according to executives at tech companies that make the machines for utilities, and a fleet of dozens if not hundreds would be needed to monitor a network.\n\nPower grid companies are expected to spend over $13 billion a year on drones and robotics by 2026 globally, from about $2 billion now, according to Navigant Research.\n\nBut that is still dwarfed by the amount of money the sector loses every year because of network failures and forced shutdowns - about $170 billion, according to PwC.\n\nThe growing demand from utilities is coming at a time of swift technological advances in civilian long-distance drones. The prototypes, which are about a meter-long and wide, not only have aircraft systems but can avoid obstacles, detect other flying objects - from helicopters to hang gliders - while mapping grids with thermal and infrared sensors.\n\nHowever the future of these flying robots in the utility sector hinges on regulation.\n\nBVLOS drone flights are largely prohibited because of safety concerns. However, over the past year European watchdogs have for the first time granted special permits to allow utilities - namely RTE and Snam - to test prototypes.\n\nThe European Commission is working on new Europe-wide regulations to govern the use of civilian drones, including long-distance ones, but has disclosed few details.\n\nA Commission source said the EU executive expected to put forward the rules by the end of the year, with a view to adoption in early 2019. The new regulations should make it simpler for companies that need to operate BVLOS drones to receive clearance, the source said.\n\n\"The objective is to speed up the opening of the drone services market,\" the source added.\n\nYet without any clear guidance as to how the new rules will look, or will work in practice, many companies have adopted a wait-and-see approach.\n\nThe situation is mirrored in the United States.\n\nAs in Europe, special permits are needed for BVLOS flights but the aviation regulator, the FAA, is looking to simplify and speed the process of winning such waivers, including by automating it.\n\nXcel Energy in April became the first American utility to gain approval for BVLOS flights.\n\nULC Robotics, which provides technology for the energy sector, said a growing number of U.S. utilities were looking at the technology.\n\n\"While only a handful of beyond visual line of sight flights have been granted in the utility space, we believe developments in long-range flight are going to advance within the next two to three years,\" said business development manager Tom Barracca.\n\nIt is still early days for drones in the utility sector, which is known for its slow pace of change.\n\nCompanies have only started using in-sight drones over about the past two years. While their short range limits them to specific tasks, such as inspecting a known problem, utilities say they are more efficient at that than helicopter surveys.\n\n\"You are not only saving time but also money,\" said Sven Bender, key account manager at Innogy, Germany's second-largest energy group by market value, adding that the use of drones in the industry would pick up further in the coming years.\n\nThe company's Westnetz grid unit has a handful of in-sight drones, which can stay in the air for as long as 30 minutes, to inspect parts of its 182,000 km of power lines in Germany.\n\nFrance's RTE said it avoids 1,400 days of interruption of high-voltage lines each year because it uses drones alongside its helicopters.\n\nOut-of-sight droning is set to be the next frontier for grid operators with their miles of pipes and pylons to inspect.\n\nMost energy infrastructure players manage assets scattered over large areas, located often in hard-to-reach places like mountains or deserts.\n\nAs the industry gradually moves from large conventional power plants to smaller, more fragmented green energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar panels, it also increases the number of assets and connections that need to be maintained.\n\nA drone flying along a gas grid can detect methane leakage, while along a power line it can do a lidar survey to map the lines, the health of the cable and the vegetation on either side.\n\n\"We've identified that it can save as much as $180 for every mile of data capture when compared with traditional methods,\" said Michael Chasen, CEO of drone maker PrecisionHawk.\n\nIt was a tree too close to high tension power lines at the Italian-Swiss border that led to Italy's most extensive blackout in 2003 triggering a chain reaction across the grid experts say could have been averted with drone technology.\n\nThomas Nicholls, chief marketing officer at French drone company Delair, said power groups in France and Italy were most advanced with regard to the technology. He added that safety played a major role because inspecting power lines could be a hazardous job for humans.\n\nDor Abuhasira, CEO of Israel's Percepto, which supplies drones to utilities such as Europe's biggest group Enel, sees the technology as ultimately providing a kind of private satellite service to grid operators.\n\n\"We are their Google Maps with a few high-tech bells and whistles on top.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018.", "Here is our midday CET summary of the key developments so far:\n\nBrexit turmoil: British Prime Minister Theresa May will answer MPs' questions in parliament today after another fraught week on Brexit as rumours swirl a leadership challenge is brewing.\n\nTrump on Russia: US President Donald Trump has made a u-turn on controversial remarks he gave at a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he \"misspoke\" and accepts intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election.\n\nGoogle fine: Google is today expected to face a record-busting EU antitrust fine over its Android mobile operating system.\n\nThailand cave: The Thai football team who were trapped in a cave are expected to be released from hospital, with a press conference scheduled early this afternoon.\n\nMusk apology: Elon Musk has apologised after abusing a British caver on Twitter.\n\nThis is how our as-it-happened coverage evolved over the morning:", "Ascot is known for playing host to the popular horse racing event, Royal Ascot\n\nITV is hoping to put Ascot on the map with a brand new show.\n\nThe network is launching a show called Absolutely Ascot, a source told The Sun.

It was thought that the deal put his basic wages at \u00a360,000-a-week which meant that Wilshere began earning \u00a33.12m-a year.\n\nBy 2018, Wilshere's wages jumped up to \u00a390,000, however, including lucrative bonuses, his wages were closer to \u00a3120,000-a-week.\n\nThis meant that in the 2017/2018 season, Wilshere earnt an estimated \u00a36.2 million.\n\nWilshere also earns money from endorsement deals such as the ones with Nike and Pepsi.\n\nJack Wilshere's England career\n\nJack Wilshere made his senior England debut against Hungary on August 11, 2010.\n\nThe footballer went on to make 33 more appearances for his country, with his last one coming during the Euro 2016 game in which England were knocked out by Iceland.\n\nDuring the qualifying campaign for the tournament, Wilshere was voted Man of the Match six times in seven games.\n\nJack Wilshere's next club odds\n\nAfter 17 years, Jack Wilshere has revealed he is leaving Arsenal and is taking time to consider his options.\n\nThe likes of London clubs West Ham and Crystal Palace are in the mix to be Wilshere's next club, with bookies putting them down as 9/4 and 9/2 respectively.\n\nItalian giants Juventus were also reportedly linked to the player at the beginning of June.\n\nProud of these two for the love they are showing for thier new little sister.

Before moving to Florida a month ago, I was seeing the cars -- mostly Nissan LEAFs -- everywhere I went. I would say anytime I went out beyond our corner shops (and often there as well), I saw at least one of these fun-colored LEAFs.\n\nWroclaw, Poland, is a city of about one million if you count all the students and foreigners (it has a ton of the former and, for a Polish city, quite a lot of the latter). There are 180 LEAFs in the carsharing program and 20 Nissan e-NV200 electric vans, last I heard. If you look at electric carsharing programs globally, that's surely a rather large program relative to the population -- that's even a fairly large program in absolute terms.\n\nAs you can expect, the program is easy to use. You get an app, find a car near you, go over to it, unlock it, and it's yours till you're done. The company managing the program makes sure the cars are charged each night to try to help drivers not have to worry about that.\n\nAs far as pricing, it's just 1 z\u0142oty (~27\u00a2 USD) per minute of driving and 10 groszy (3\u00a2 USD) per minute parked. That's the same pricing for the LEAF or the e-NV200.\n\nJust before leaving Poland, I met a Vozilla user in a coffee shop and decided to interview him about the program, his experiences so far, and broader context regarding his transportation habits. Check it out:\n\nThe 30,000 Vozilla users mentioned at the top have reportedly \"rented\" the cars 150,000 times and driven more than 1 million kilometers. Well, they had done so as of that report on June 6, 2018. The numbers are all presumably much higher now. Here are a few more stats from that article, translated via Google: \"The company presented statistics for the first half of the year. It follows from them that cars are rented on average 729 times a day. Most often between 15-18 hours, that is during the afternoon peak, and the average length of rental is 16 minutes.\n\n\"... The operator boasts that on the weekend of 14-15 April cars were rented 2780 times and they were transported at that time 25 thousand km.\"\n\nWe'll have much more about Vozilla in coming weeks from Jacek Fior, as well as an insight into far more e-mobility leadership in Vozilla's home city.", "BRUSSELS -- European regulators came down hard on another U.S. tech giant Wednesday, fining Google a record $5 billion for forcing cellphone makers that use the company's Android operating system to install Google search and browser apps.\n\nThe European Union said Google's practices restrict competition and reduce choices for consumers.\n\nWhile Google can easily afford the fine, the ruling could undermine the company's business model, which relies on giving away its operating system in return for opportunities to sell ads and other products.\n\nGoogle immediately said it will appeal, arguing that its free operating system has led to lower-price phones and created competition with its chief rival, Apple.\n\nAndroid has \"created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted .\n\nGoogle has 90 days to put remedies in place regardless of its appeal -- which could involve unbundling key apps and allowing Android handset manufacturers to sell devices using altered versions of Android.\n\nMozilla Foundation, the non-profit group that creates the lightweight ad-blocking browser Firefox Focus, said the ruling gives it the opportunity to displace Chrome as the default browser in some phones. It has been in talks with manufacturers from Huawei to Samsung about that.\n\nThe ruling creates \"a huge opportunity,\" Denelle Dixon, Mozilla's chief operating officer, said Wednesday.\n\nIt's also possible not much will change. Google Search, Chrome and the Play Store are popular with consumers and developers. Handset manufacturers could choose them despite unbundling.\n\n\"It's possible phone manufacturers won't actually take advantage of the newfound freedom they have,\" said Thomas Vinje, lead lawyer for FairSearch, the Brussels-based lobbying group backed by Oracle, TripAdvisor and others that was the main complainant in the case. \"It at least opens up the possibility.\"\n\nThe fine, which caps a three-year investigation, is the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe ruling could stoke tensions between Europe and the U.S., which regulates the tech industry with a lighter hand. Still, some U.S. politicians welcomed it.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut tweeted that the fine should \"be a wake-up call\" to the Federal Trade Commission and should lead U.S. enforcers to protect consumers. Blumenthal previously called on regulators to investigate how Google tracks users of Android phones.\n\nIn its ruling, the EU said Google broke the rules by requiring cellphone makers to take a bundle of Google apps if they wanted any at all.\n\nThe bundle contains 11 apps, including YouTube, Maps and Gmail, but regulators focused on three that had the biggest market share: Google Search, Chrome and the company's app store, called Play Store.\n\nThe EU also took issue with Google's payments to wireless carriers and phone makers to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app.\n\nIt ruled, too, that Google broke the law by forcing manufacturers that took its apps to commit to not selling devices that use altered versions of Android.\n\nRegardless of the pending appeal, failure to come up with remedies to rectify the behavior after 90 days risks a further penalty of up to $15 million a day.\n\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that given the size of the company, the 4.34 billion euro fine is not disproportionate.\n\nThe Google crackdown comes at a sensitive time for trans-Atlantic relations, with President Donald Trump lambasting the EU as a \"foe\" only last week. The U.S. imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum this year, and the EU responded with duties on American goods.\n\n\"We have to protect consumers and competition to make sure consumers get the best of fair competition,\" Vestager said. \"We will continue to do it, no matter the political context.\"\n\nThe penalty is on top of a 2.42 billion euro fine ($2.8 billion) that regulators imposed on Google a year ago for favoring its shopping listings in search results.\n\nNeither fine will cripple the company. Google parent Alphabet, made $9.4 billion in profit in the first three months of the year and has over $100 billion in cash reserves.\n\n\"What is important is that Google has to change its abusive behavior,\" said Rich Stables, CEO of the rival search engine Kelkoo.\n\nAndroid is technically an open-source operating system that Google lets cellphone makers use for free. As a result, it is the most widely used system, beating Apple's iOS by a wide margin.\n\nThe EU wants to ensure that phone makers are free to pre-install apps of their choosing. It also wants cellphone makers to be able to more easily use altered versions of Android, like Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nBoth Amazon and Samsung, maker of the popular Galaxy line of phones, declined to comment on the ruling.\n\nGoogle argues that downloads are easy and while the inclusion of its suite of apps help phones run well out of the box, competitors' apps are a tap away.\n\nIt also argues that not supporting so-called \"forked\" versions of Android ensures a baseline of experience across some 24,000 different models of Android device. Vestager called the compatibility argument a \"smokescreen.\"\n\nEuropean regulators have set the pace in shaping rules for the tech industry.\n\nThe EU has clashed repeatedly with Microsoft over the years, fining it over its bundling practices and its promotion of its Internet Explorer browser.\n\nIn 2016, the EU ruled that Apple was getting preferential treatment from the Irish government and demanded it pay $15 billion in back taxes. The EU has also tangled with Amazon and Intel.\n\nEuropean regulators have likewise taken a harder line on data privacy. After the scandal this spring involving the misuse of Facebook users' personal data during the U.S. presidential election and other campaigns, the EU began enforcing tougher new rules.\n\n___\n\nNakashima reported from Menlo Park, California. Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien in Providence, R.I.; Nick Jesdanun in New York; and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this story.", "Pulling the plug on one of the prime features driving the use of the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app in recent months, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has told banks cashbacks for BHIM transactions will be restricted to new users.\n\nPulling the plug on one of the prime features driving the use of the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app in recent months, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has told banks cashbacks for BHIM transactions will be restricted to new users. Moreover, incentives for merchants accepting unified payments interface (UPI) payments have been withdrawn altogether, effective July 1.\n\nTo avail a cashback on the BHIM app now, one needs not only to be a new user, but also make 10 unique transactions of at least Rs 50 each. After the 10th transaction, one receives Rs 150 as cashback.\n\nIn April this year, the government had launched a scheme entailing cashbacks of up to Rs 750 per month for consumers using BHIM. Merchants who accepted payments through any UPI app were entitled to a maximum cashback of Rs 1,000 per month. They were entitled to receive a cashback worth 10% of the value of each transaction, subject to a cap of Rs 50 per transaction.\n\nIn a notification dated July 17, NPCI said that following a review of the incentive scheme, the ministry for electronics and information technology has decided to scale it back significantly.\n\nThe cashback scheme for consumers had come in for criticism, with players like Mobikwik and PhonePe accusing it of being discriminatory against other UPI apps. Some commentators also said that the incentives were encouraging \"misuse\" of the payment mode.\n\nThe move could hit UPI usage to an extent, as the incentive scheme was clearly pushing up UPI volumes in recent months. Over the three-month period ended June 2018, monthly volumes had risen 38%; they crossed the 200-million mark for the first time to clock a total of 246.37 million in June.\n\nThe BHIM app, which has steadily lost share to rivals such as Paytm, Google Tez and PhonePe, sorely needed the incentives to shore up usage. In August 2017, the NPCI-promoted app used to account for 45% of all UPI transactions. In June 2018, its share was down to a mere 6.6%.\n\nPayment players cite anecdotal evidence to say BHIM usage had picked up as a result of the incentive scheme. For example, more people were using it to book tickets on the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation site, which is something of a bellwether for payments behaviour in India, Harshil Mathur, CEO and co-founder, Razorpay, said.\n\nPayment companies are taking the move in their stride, saying that the scheme was all along expected to be only a temporary booster. \"There might be incentives in other forms once UPI 2.0 launches. If they offer periodic incentives of the kind Amazon and Flipkart do, that could be effective, too,\" Mathur said.\n\nVivek Belgavi, partner and India fintech leader, PwC India, said the incentives have done their job of helping lay the railroad for digital payments. Any further push will have to be more structural in nature. \"These will be areas such as inter-wallet interoperability, the full-time launch of Bharat BillPay and UPI 2.0. There are many nuclear-focused operators that have now come in and to that extent, a lot has been done,\" he added.", "EBay is one of the online services that have not been taxed by the Revenue Department for overseas transactions.\n\nThe Revenue Department anticipates that 80-100 large foreign-based digital platform operators that render services to Thai consumers will sign up as value-added tax (VAT) registrants in Thailand after the e-business tax comes into force.\n\nThese foreign e-business operators, dominating 80-90% of Thailand's e-business service value, will be willing to register for VAT payment to avoid tarnishing their corporate governance image, said Patricia Mongkhonvanit, principal adviser on strategic tax administration at the Revenue Department.\n\nThe cabinet on Tuesday approved an amended Revenue Code related to VAT collection on e-business operators with a physical presence outside of Thailand but earning income here.\n\nUnder the amended code, foreign-based digital platform operators providing services, including online games, sticker downloads, online advertisements, digital content and online hotel bookings to Thai consumers are liable for VAT.\n\nThese online business operators are required to sign up for VAT payment through the Revenue Department's online system within 30 days of the law taking effect if their income in Thailand exceeds 1.8 million baht a year.\n\nFor hotel booking sites, VAT will be charged based on service, not accommodation, fees.\n\nShe estimates that VAT collected from foreign online business platform providers would contribute 3 billion baht a year to the government's coffers.\n\nVAT collection for foreign online business operators, expected to come into force this year, is aimed at creating a level playing field for local digital platform service providers as they are now subject to the tax if their annual online business income exceeds 1.8 million baht.\n\nTo determine whether foreign-based digital platform providers are correctly paying VAT incurred from income earned in Thailand, the Revenue Department will require local operators who use or purchase their services to report such transactions.\n\nLocal operators are prohibited from claiming expenses incurred from buying products or services from non-VAT registrants in Thailand as tax deductible expenses, Mrs Patricia said.\n\nMembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have introduced VAT on goods and services purchased online, and 50 countries now impose such a tax.\n\nFor the planned revocation of the VAT exemption for online shopping of goods worth less than 1,500 baht bought from foreign vendors outside of Thailand and shipped by mail, the Revenue Department is studying the issue.\n\nThe VAT exemption waiver needs to be studied because it could hurt the trade ecosystem, Mrs Patricia said, adding that it was essential to think about how to handle VAT payments if such an exemption was scrapped, as more than 100,000 parcels a day are gathered at Laksi Post Office before being shipped.\n\nPurchases from foreign e-commerce vendors outside of Thailand are subject to 7% VAT if value exceeds 1,500 baht, but many online operators exploit the loophole by breaking up invoices into amounts below the threshold to skirt the levy.\n\n\"The government needs to collect VAT, as Thais are estimated to spend tens of billions of baht for cross-border digital services and shopping,\" said Pawoot Pongvitayapanu, former president of the Thai E-commerce Association and founder of Tarad.com.\n\nThere are 11 categories of online services not taxed by the Revenue Department, as money paid by Thais is directly sent abroad.\n\nThese are e-commerce businesses such as Amazon and eBay; media and advertising players like Google, Facebook and Line; marketing and other services including Evernote; transport providers such as Grab and airlines; travel platforms like Agoda, Booking.com and Airbnb; Digital content providers like Netflix, Joox and Spotify; software and apps from Apple and Microsoft; games; infrastructure like Amazon Cloud, Microsoft Cloud and Google Cloud; financial services likes PayPal; and gambling.\n\n\"The VAT collection for foreign online operators is a good starting point to help Thailand earn tax revenue from foreign-based digital service providers and is in line with consumer behaviour, as they tend to shop more online in the digital age,\" Mr Pawoot said. \"Such VAT collection could have some side effects but is worthwhile to prevent the country from losing revenue overseas. Thais need to admit that the VAT payment is not for themselves but for our country.\"\n\nThe Revenue Department can cooperate with the Bank of Thailand to track payments for overseas online services and product purchases from credit and debit cards, he said. Companies in Thailand can help withhold the 7% VAT and remit it to the Revenue Department before paying to foreign online service providers.\n\nCountries like Australia and Japan require VAT payment for online services, while India imposes a 6% withholding tax.\n\nPhensiri Sathianvongnusar, chief executive of aCommerce Thailand, Southeast Asia's leading e-commerce solution firm, said the e-commerce tax is aimed at levelling the playing field between offline and online players.\n\nThe VAT collection on foreign-based digital platform providers will be a boon to traditional vendors, she said.", "Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha (fourth right), Digital Economy and Society Minister Pichet Dirongkaveroj (fourth left) and Google Thailand country director Ben King (second right) gather at Thursday's first-of-its-kind Google event in Thailand.\n\nGoogle Thursday announced a collaboration with local partners on access to education, content, localised products and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) promotion as part of the tech giant's long-term goal of broadening its digital economy network in Thailand.\n\nThe strategy was announced Thursday at Google's first-ever event in the country, dubbed \"Leave No Thais Behind\".\n\nAccording to Ben King, country director of Google Thailand, the company will launch its high-speed public WiFi, Google Station, through a partnership with CAT Telecom. The scheme will be sponsored by Unilever.\n\nThailand will be the fourth country in the world in which Google will introduce the high-speed public WiFi platform. The company launched the product in India two years ago, in Indonesia in 2017 and in Mexico City in March 2018.\n\nGoogle will also partner with True Digital Park to build Google Space, a digital skills training facility in Bangkok that will open on the same date as True Digital Park.\n\nOn the SME and startup front, Google Thailand announced a collaboration with Siam Commercial Bank that will let Thai SMEs sign up and get verified for Google My Business, a free business listing on Google Search and Google Maps, through SCB personnel who will visit SMEs at their offices.\n\nLastly, Mr King said the company will relaunch its YouTube Pop-Up Space in Bangkok this November, giving Thai creators access to state-of-the-art production facilities to support localised product and content development.\n\nThe company is introducing a data plan in collaboration with Advanced Info Service to attract Thailand's growing YouTube community. Mobile leader AIS will offer unlimited data packs at nine baht per day for YouTube Go, an app that lets viewers in Thailand watch and share YouTube videos with a slow or no internet connection.\n\nThis move could represent an important advantage for AIS, especially with regard to its younger cohort who are heavy video and data users.\n\nThe \"strategic partnership\", however, is not exclusive, which means the second- and third-largest operators could also offer the service in future. Details about the duration of the AIS deal were not disclosed.\n\nWhile the Google collaboration could help broaden the telecom's customer base, it could also have an effect on AIS's absolute profits by cannibalising more expensive products. Users whose video habits compel them to buy expensive data packages can now migrate to the more affordable service.\n\nPratthana Leelapanang, chief consumer business officer for AIS, denied that the scheme would have any such effects, given that the cheaper packages will also use less data.\n\n\"It's a win-win situation,\" he said.\n\nThe Google event was attended by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, Digital Economy and Society Minister Pichet Durongkaveroj and Glyn Davies, the US ambassador to Thailand.\n\nGen Prayut said the collaboration between Google and local firms is critical to the Thailand 4.0 policy.\n\n\"Today, the government is moving several critical projects related to the digital economy, including smart cities, digital government, big data management and cybersecurity,\" the premier said. \"The question is how we will keep creating value through these projects for the next 20 years, in line with our 20-year national strategy roadmap.\"", "CP Rail said service interruptions related to labour negotiations and strike notices caused its net income to decrease in the second quarter\n\nCanadian Pacific Railway Ltd.

There will be 161 units in all, ranging in size from 800 square feet to 1,200 square feet. Most will be one-bedroom suites, with a few two- and three-bedroom units in the mix.\n\nOn the first few floors, the ceilings will be 12-feet high, loftier than the eight-foot ceilings you'd find in a typical apartment. Up on the seventh storey, the ceilings will tower to 16 feet. And on the eighth storey, the penthouse suites will be built on three levels and offer residents stunning rooftop patios. But in truth, the views from the windows on every level are pretty remarkable, offering angles on the Edmonton skyline you don't typically see.\n\nDub plans to leave the steel support beams and the ceilings exposed, and to restore, as much as possible, the original marble terrazzo floors in the lobby and staircases.\n\n\"Terrazzo is bulletproof. You have to do a lot to break it down,\" Seitinger said.\n\n\"It's a solid old building, well constructed. It was federally-funded, at the time, and I'm sure there was no cost spared.\"\n\nThey hope to have suites ready for occupancy by next spring, and to have finished the project, complete with underground parkade, adjoining park, landscaping and four-storey glass atrium, by the end of 2019.\n\nThey're also planning 27 three-bedroom townhouses to be built just north of the hospital, atop the parkade.\n\nI'll admit, I've wondered if Dub was mad to repurpose this building, rather than demolish it. Who, I thought, would want to live in an old hospital with its stark institutional architecture? But now, 14 years later, mid-century modernist architecture is hot -- and the old building suddenly looks sleek and retro-futuristic.\n\n\"Most people would have just knocked it down,\" said Seitinger. \"Everyone was telling Gene to knock it down. But Gene has saved a lot of old buildings.\"\n\nSomething else has changed in the last 14 years: our community's understanding of reconciliation.\n\nThe original red brick Camsell, long-ago-demolished, was built as a sanitorium, primarily for Indigenous tuberculosis patients, First Nations and Inuit, who were removed from their families and cultures and virtually incarcerated here. In acknowledgment of that dark, complicated past, Dub invited an Indigenous elder, who has smudged and cleansed here every three months, to co-ordinate with the four seasons. And just east of the building, Dub is promising a public park dedicated to those Indigenous patients, where everyone from Inglewood and beyond can come to remember.\n\nOf course, after 14 years, it's natural to be skeptical. There have been so many false starts, so many promises unkept. Paul Adams, president of the Inglewood Community League, isn't planning a party just yet.\n\n\"Any activity is good activity,\" Adams said. \"I'm happy they're off to a good start. I hope they can maintain momentum.\n\nNow, he's worried units will be too expensive for the Inglewood market.\n\n\"That could be our next stumbling block. Let's hope he has a remarkable marketing plan in mind.\"\n\nBut as Seitinger proudly surveys the work, he doesn't sound worried.\n\n\"It's been a wait for this building. But when it's done? Well, Gene doesn't build cracker boxes. He does nice buildings. He's very particular.\n\n\"He's determined to finish it. He's committed to this, he really is. He's fully aware that everybody's looking to get it done.\"\n\nI hope he's right. The Inglewood neighbourhood has endured far too much delay already. This site needs healing. And it can't come soon enough.\n\npsimons@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/Paulatics\n\nwww.facebook.com/EJPaulaSimons\n\nSubscribe to our provincial affairs podcast, The Press Gallery, on iTunes or on Google Play", "Earlier this week, a report explained that the App Store is still bringing in nearly double the revenue of Google Play, despite the fact that the Play Store accumulates one twice as many downloads as the App Store.\n\nNow, new research from Creative Strategies dives deeper into how consumers view and spend on the App Store...\n\nSylvania HomeKit Light Strip\n\nFirst and foremost, the research - collected from a sample of 800 United States smartphone's users - shows that 20 percent of iOS users \"browse the App Store daily.\" Furthermore, another 32 percent say they browse it weekly. This is compared to 9 percent of users who browse the Play Store daily, and 21 percent who browse weekly.\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, the built-in search functionality in the App Store is not all that popular among users, according to this survey. Just 16 percent of App Store users say they used the built-in search functionality to find applications \"as their primary method.\"\n\nFurthermore, 35 percent of iOS users said they use search on \"occasion\" but generally rely on internet search, such as Google, to locate the apps they are looking for.\n\nSearch as a primary tool to find the right apps does not seem to be very popular. Only 16% of iOS panelists and 18% of Android panelists resort to it as their primary method. When getting into how effective search within the stores actually is, one gets the feeling that there is plenty of opportunity for improvement.\n\n35% of iOS panelists said to be using search on occasion but believe internet search gives better results. 33% use search regularly and find that the results generally match what they want.\n\nWhen it comes to the point of deciding which app to purchase, 38 percent of iOS users say they rely more on the features provided by the app rather than reviews. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Android users cite reviews as the top point in their decision-making process.\n\nInterestingly, when it comes to paid apps, the leading drivers remain the same for both groups but only after the price of the app itself. In other words, great reviews, feature list, screenshots, and app description do not matter if the price is already beyond what the user perceives to be the right price for the app.\n\nLastly, the survey took an attempt at the difference in spending habits between iOS and Android users.\n\nWhen it comes to in-app purchases, neither Android users nor iOS users were averse to in-app purchases, with 56 percent of iOS users and 64 percent of Android users say they \"did not feel like they were tricked into an in-app purchase or subscription.\"\n\nUsers did, however, express concern with subscriptions in general, with 54 percent of iOS panelists saying they would prefer a one-time payment and 47 percent of Android users coming in agreement.\n\nIn terms of advertising, 46 percent of iOS users said they would make an in-app purchase to remove ads, while 38 percent of Android users said they would.\n\nThe true difference between the two platforms, however, comes in the number of paid apps and subscriptions. 45 percent of iOS users surveyed claimed to have five or more paid apps or subscriptions, compared to just 19 percent of Android panelists.\n\nThis data certainly echoes reports in the past that indicate a stark contrast between revenue generation on the App Store and Play Store.

He had created the computer generated hairstyles for some of the characters in Tangled, an animated Disney film. Sadeghi left his position at Google, and began working for Pinscreen in February 2017.\n\nHe alleges that the company submitted false results to SIGGRAPH last year in January, and used \"manually prepared hair shapes\" instead of generating original content before he was employed.\n\nThe original submission was rejected for being \"below the SIGGRAPH standard,\" that \"a lot of disturbing artifacts can be observed in almost all hair models\" and that they \"seriously doubt if the quality is good enough for games or VR applications.\"\n\nThe team resubmitted results to SIGGRAPH Asia 2017 Technical Papers and was asked to generate 100 avatars from 100 input images. In Skype conversations, Li said \"then I have an artist create 100 hairs ahahahaha,\" and, \"basically, I need to create 3D hair models for 100 people or get 3D modelers to do it.\"\n\nThey also supposedly struggled to generate the right eye colour from images, despite writing in the submission that \"eye color recognition, [is] only possible due to recent advances in deep learning.\" Pinscreen claimed to generate realistic cartoon avatars from input images fed into a convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\nWhen Sadeghi confronted Li about the fabrication of the results and academic misconduct, Li allegedly said that they would never be shown publicly. Li apparently also promised: \"We won't present something we don't have\".\n\nBut in June 2017, Pinscreen, apparently, lied again and misrepresented the manually prepared hairstyles as being automatic to Softbank investors. In a screenshot of another conversation between Pinscreen employees, Li wrote: \"Pinscreen just fucked Softbank\".\n\nThe lawsuit claims that this deceitful behaviour continued and in August 2017, Pinscreen reportedly relied on manual avatars again for the SIGGRAPH 2017 Real Time Live demonstrations.\n\nHere's a recorded video of the presentation (skip to 31:13 to see Li and Sadeghi onstage)\n\nYoutube Video\n\nPrior to the event, Sadeghi warned the team that the avatars generated using the CNNs would sometimes give inaccurate hairstyles. It also took the model about minute and a half to spit out an output.\n\nLi said that it was too slow and unimpressive. After repeatedly failed attempts and looming deadlines, Li, desperately sought out a freelance artist in Germany, named Leszek, to prepare all the hairstyles to be used in the live demo. He wanted to woo TechCrunch, a startup news website, and reportedly said:\"\"TechCrunch coverage should be our target.\"\n\nAfter the presentation, Sadeghi requested to a one-on-one meeting to talk about \"multiple important topics\". During the meeting he received a termination letter and was told to return his work laptop. Sadeghi reportedly said he would return the laptop after he retrieved some personal data and tried to leave Pinscreen's offices.\n\n\"However, Li and three other Pinscreen employees, under Li's commands, surrounded Sadeghi and physically attacked him. They grabbed Sadeghi and his backpack, which he was wearing, violently restrained him, forcibly opened his backpack and took possession of Sadeghi's work laptop,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nSadeghi reportedly suffered injuries to his eyes and previously dislocated shoulder.\n\n\"Pinscreen strongly denies Mr. Sadeghi's allegations. Mr. Sadeghi was terminated in August of 2017 after six months of employment. The company looks forward to defending against Mr. Sadeghi's action and to vindication after the presentation of facts in court,\" Li said in an email to The Register.\n\nLi also said Sadeghi was fired for being \"unproductive, and incompetent.\" He also denied claims of data fabrication and assault. \"The exact opposite happened, he assaulted our company's CFO, injured her nose, and tried to run away with our company laptop which contained sensitive compay source code. Noone assaulted him.\"\n\nSadeghi was not immediately available for comment. \u00ae", "Antitrust regulators in the European Union are charging Google a $5 billion fine for using its Android software to push out competition and making phone companies pre-install its apps.

AAPL, -0.55% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.05% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.01% GOOG, -0.24% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.78% and Facebook Inc. FB, -0.30% -- combined are worth $4.095 trillion versus $4.092 for the bottom 282 companies.\n\nAs mind-boggling as that may be, Batnick told MarketWatch that this sort of concentration is normal, pointing out that AT&T and General Motors represented 14.5% of the S&P 500 during their heyday in 1965.\n\nWhat is different today, however, is that all the big players are uniformly tech names.\n\n\"The gains have been extraordinary over the past five years, with Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google growing from $1.2 trillion to near $4 trillion,\" wrote Batnick in a recent blog entry,\n\nIn the two weeks since he posted that, the fabulous five have crossed over the $4 trillion mark. The stupendous growth of the tech giants over the past few years has sparked concerns that the stock market will see a repeat of the dot-com bust from the late 1990s.\n\nBut Batnick dismissed those fears.\n\nThe main difference between then and now is that today's tech rally can be justified by valuations.\n\n\"These five have earned nearly half a trillion dollars over the last five years and are currently trading at 37 times earnings and 5.5 times sales,\" he said.\n\nThe numbers were definitely more inflated two decades ago.\n\nThe big four then -- Intel Corp. INTC, -0.06% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.31% Microsoft MSFT, -0.78% and Oracle Corp. ORCL, -0.53% -- were trading at 100 times earnings and 26 times sales.\n\n\"Am I worried this is a repeat of 1999? Not particularly,\" Batnick said.\n\nSo far this year, Apple has added 13%, Amazon.com has soared 58%, Facebook has rallied 19%, Microsoft has jumped 23%, and Alphabet had surged 15%, outpacing the S&P 500's SPX, +0.22% 5.3% gains and helping the Nasdaq rise 14%.\n\nSue Chang\n\nSue Chang is a MarketWatch reporter in San Francisco.

After all, Chrome OS is a Linux variant. But, doing it by using either Crouton in a chroot container or Gallium OS, a Xubuntu Chromebook-specific Linux variant, wasn't easy. Then, Google announced it was bringing a completely integrated Linux desktop to the Chromebook.\n\nToday, with a properly-equipped Chromebook and the bravery to run canary code, you can run Debian Linux on your Chromebook. Here's how to do it.\n\nThis new Chromebook Linux feature is Crostini, the umbrella technology for getting Linux running with Chrome OS. Crostini gets enough Linux running to run KVM, Linux's built-in virtual machine (VM). On top of this, Crostini starts and runs LXC containers. You won't see it, unless you look closely, but it's in those containers that your Debian Linux instances are running.\n\nEventually, anyone with a newer Chromebook will be able to run Linux. Specifically, if your Chromebook's operating system is based on the Linux 4.4 kernel, you'll be supported. But we're not there yet. It's also possible that older Chromebooks, running Linux 4.14, will be retrofitted with Crostini support.\n\nOfficially, you need a Pixelbook, Google's top-of-the-line Chromebook, to run Linux. But, users have found a dozen other models can run Crostini with half-a-dozen others expected to be supported soon. Chromebooks that can already use Crostini include newer Intel-powered Chromebooks from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung. Dell models will start getting supported later this year.\n\nI used my best-of-breed Pixelbook with its 1.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor, 512GB SSD, with 16GBs of RAM for my tests. This is the fastest Chromebook on the market. It's not cheap, at a list price of $1,399, but it's worth it if you want to push Linux on the Chromebook's limits.\n\nOnce you have the hardware you need, you must switch your Chromebook from the stable update channel to the dev channel. This is alpha software and it updates about once a week. Let me make this absolutely clear: This is not stable software. It will blow up at times. But, faint heart never won fair technology discoveries.\n\nThis is a bigger decision than it looks at first. You'll lose all your local data if you try to go back to the stable, or even beta, channels. With a Chromebook that's not much of a problem since most of your data and settings are kept on the Google Cloud, it's still worth keeping in mind.\n\nIf you want to wait and be safe, Crostini support is expected to enter the stable channel with Chrome OS 69 in mid-September.\n\nTo make the switch to dev, take the following steps:\n\nOnce that's done, if you're not using a Pixelbook you may need to set a Chrome flag to access Linux. You do this by entering: chrome://flags on the Chrome browser's address line. This command displays all of Chrome's experimental features. Scroll down the list until you find:\n\n#enable-experimental-crostini-ui\n\nActivate this, and your system may be ready to go. I say \"may\" because to run Crostini your Chromebook must not only be on the dev channel, but Google must also have enabled the Linux VM for your hardware.\n\nThe easiest way to confirm that a particular Chromebook works with Linux is to follow the above steps and then open Chrome OS's built-in shell, crosh, and run the shell command:\n\nvmc start termina\n\nIf you get a message such as \"ERROR: command 'vmc' is not available\", you're out of luck. But, if you see a terminal, congrats, you've just found a new Chromebook that's Linux-ready.\n\nNext, head to Chrome OS settings (chrome://settings), scroll down to to \"Linux (Beta)\" and activate it.\n\nNow, open the app switcher by pressing the Search/Launcher key and type \"Terminal\". This launches the Termina VM, which will start running a Debian 9.0 Stretch Linux container.\n\nCongratulations! You're now running Debian Linux on your Chromebook.\n\nFrom here you can install and run programs using Debian's normal software commands. For example, to update my new Linux system and install the lynx web browser, I'd run:\n\nWhile you could install pretty much any program on your new Linux instance, I gave a shell-based program example because accelerated graphics and audio aren't working yet. So, while you could install Cinnamon, my favorite Linux interface, or Steam for games, it's not fast enough even on a maxed out Pixelbook to be that enjoyable. Not yet anyway.\n\nIn addition, many graphics-based programs, such as the photo-editor Gimp, won't run yet on Crostini. Give it time to mature before trying to get too fancy with heavy graphics software.\n\nSoon, though, Linux and Chrome will be a matched pair. Come that day, I see high-end Chromebooks becoming the laptops of choice for developers.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to do more with Linux and Chromebook, check out the excellent Reddit Crostini Wiki. For up-to-the-minute hands-on information about Crostini, its parent Reddit forum is the best resource on the web.", "Thanks to some English articles, a Green Day song, and upvotes on Reddit, Donald Trump hits the top of search engines for all the wrong reasons\n\nThanks to some English articles, a Green Day song, and upvotes on Reddit, Donald Trump hits the top of search engines for all the wrong reasons\n\nNow, the internet can be a funny place. It's filled with memes, funny cats pictures, and enough opinions to fill anyone's day. However, sometimes strange things can happen when it comes to the Google search engine, which is what seems to be the case at the moment when you Google the term \"idiot\" and get images of the U.S. president, Donald Trump.\n\nThat's right, if you Google \"idiot,\" Donald Trump will turn up at the top of the image search results.\n\nAs Time points out, sometimes Google makes mistakes when it comes to its search algorithm. Back in 2004, Google got it extremely wrong when searches for the term \"Jew\" turned up anti-Semitic sites. In 2009, when people Googled \"Michelle Obama\" an image of the \"first lady's face retouched to have ape-like features\" showed up according to TheGuardian. Then, searching for the term \"rapist\" before the U.S. election began showing images of Bill Clinton.\n\nSo, why does this happen?\n\nSometimes the reason for these sorts of anomalies cannot be explained and is merely a glitch in the algorithm. Google explains it as such according to The Guardian.\n\n\"A site's ranking in Google's search results relies heavily on computer algorithms using thousands of factors to calculate a page's relevance to a given query. Sometimes subtleties of language cause anomalies to appear that cannot be predicted.\"\n\nOther times, however, the glitch is a result of people and sites, effectively, gaming the system. This is likely the case in regard to the term \"idiot\" currently bringing up images of Donald Trump.\n\nAs USA Today points out, part of the reason for this result is that several English articles published last week included the Green Day song titled \"American Idiot\" in the headline in relation to Donald Trump and his trip to England. This meant that images were likely titled to describe the article and used the terms \"American Idiot\" and Donald Trump as descriptives in the image metadata as well as in the article content. As a result, Google's algorithm has paired these terms together, and with so many people reading and sharing these articles, it has pushed its relevance to the top of the search results.\n\nAlong with this, The Guardian also points out that there has been an active push on Reddit to have people upvote an image of Donald Trump that is titled \"idiot.\" Once again, this upvoting has helped to tell Google's algorithm that the term \"idiot\" should be associated with the term \"Donald Trump.\"\n\nAs yet, it is unclear when this anomaly will correct itself. Likely, Trump will have to wait for someone else to be labeled an idiot before his image starts dropping from Google's search results.", "\"There are currently 117 active rapid charging stations nationwide, a further 19 under construction, and 42 planned sites.\" (Image Credit: Pixabay)\n\nAssociate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter today launched EVRoam, a new initiative providing electric car drivers with real-time information about where they can find reliable charging stations right around the country.\n\nEVRoam is a live database, collated by the NZ Transport Agency from real-time data fed directly from charging station operators such as Chargenet and Vector. EVRoam then shares this information out as widely as possible, to dozens of other websites and apps, so that drivers can receive reliable data on charging stations through all channels.\n\n\"This is about giving people the practical tools to confidently drive an electric car right around the country and know they have the power to go the distance,\" said Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter.\n\n\"EVRoam lets drivers know if a charging station is active and able to be used, which means they can confidently plan their journeys.\n\n\"EVRoam aims to give drivers confidence by identifying only reliable charging stations that meet government guidelines, such as having a consistent plug type and being monitored.\n\n\"The real-time data will be made available on the Agency's journey planner website, and to other third party platforms like Google Maps, TomTom and the Automobile Association's website.\n\n\"There are currently 117 active rapid charging stations nationwide, a further 19 under construction, and 42 planned sites.\n\n\"We now have electric vehicle rapid charging stations every 75km on almost 80 percent of the state highway network, which is a huge achievement.\n\n\"Initiatives like this are part of the Government's commitment to making sustainable transport an easy option for all New Zealanders,\" said Ms Genter.", "(Bloomberg) -- For highly-skilled foreign workers applying for a new work visa or an extension, the stakes involved just got a whole lot higher.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently updated its guidance, taking a much stricter approach to approving applications that are largely filed by those seeking work in the tech industry.\n\nUnder the new policy, which goes into effect Sept. 11, agents will be able to deny applications deemed incomplete or containing errors, without first asking applicants to address the flaw or warning them of an intent to refuse their submission. Recently the agency also widened the range of cases for which it could begin the process of removing foreign nationals to include those whose immigration benefits, such as work status, have been denied.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe measures are likely to disproportionately affect those whose applications require large amounts of supporting evidence, said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Employees with H-1B visas -- mostly held by people in the technology, science and medicine industries -- are currently often asked to respond to a request for evidence from USCIS to prove whether they are qualified for their work, or whether their job is considered a specialty occupation, Pierce added.\n\nThe updates could make small errors on filings lead to harsh consequences -- including deportation -- and are part of \"a broader trend of USCIS becoming more of an enforcement agency than an immigrants benefits agency,\" Pierce said. The USCIS in February updated its mission statement to remove reference to the U.S. as a \"nation of immigrants\" and instead included language on \"protecting Americans\" and \"securing the homeland.\"\n\nIn April, the USCIS said it received 105,000 more H-1B applications than it can grant, according to a National Foundation for American Policy report. Still, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and other U.S. tech giants saw an increase in the number of H-1B applications approved in 2017.\n\nThe recent move by USCIS \"creates traps\" for individuals already working legally in the country -- or seeking to work here -- by upping the consequences for clerical errors, said Todd Schulte, president of immigration reform lobbying group Fwd.us, which was founded by technology leaders including Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston.\n\nAnd it could affect more than just tech companies, Schulte said. \"Cracking down on legal immigration is simply this: It's encouraging innovation and job growth to happen someplace else.\" Microsoft Corp. expanded its Vancouver office several years ago, in part due to Canada's more lax visa regulations.\n\nThe updated USCIS policies add a layer of instability for employers. \"There's a chance that not only is the case going to be denied, but also that the beneficiary could be placed in removal proceedings,\" said Hassan Ahmad, managing attorney with the HMA law firm. \"How can you do business with this type of uncertainty?\"\n\nUSCIS spokesman Michael Bars said the policy changes are part of an effort to help \"cut down on frivolous applications, reduce waste, and help ensure legitimate, law abiding petitioners aren't undermined by those able to game our system.\"\n\nThe number of requests for evidence to H-1B visa petitions rose 45 percent for the period of Jan.1 to Aug. 31, 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to a report by Reuters. Given the volume of the requests, \"it may seem like it would be a natural option\" for USCIS officers to want to leverage the new policies to avoid issuing additional RFE's, said Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But without the requests for evidence, applicants don't have an opportunity to explain themselves if they make a mistake that could be as minor as writing their work address incorrectly on an application, she said.", "Sabine Schmitz, above, started on Top Gear after the departure of Jeremy Clarkson and is likely to have a bigger role in the next series\n\nShe joined Top Gear after the controversial departure of Jeremy Clarkson and Co, and since then she has seen Chris Evans quit the hit show. Yet nothing seems to faze driving ace Sabine Schmitz. And it will come as no surprise to her legion of fans that the German racer now looks set to prosper with an expanded role in the next series.\n\nSabine is, after all, the Queen of the Nurburgring, one of the world's most terrifying circuits. 'It's the longest, fastest and scariest rollercoaster in the world,' says Sabine. 'And it has jumps - you don't have jumps on a rollercoaster. It's the most dangerous race track in the world, that's for sure.'\n\nThe tragic statistics bear this out. About 200 people have been killed on the Nurburgring - incredibly, it is open to normal traffic as a no-limit toll road when it's not hosting a race.\n\nSabine actually grew up nearby. Her family runs a hotel and restaurant, and she spent her early years serving breakfast to F1 legends such as Niki Lauda, Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna.\n\nBut Sabine was never going to settle for serving sausages and eggs to racing drivers - she planned to be one herself.\n\nHer greatest achievement was winning the Nurburgring's gruelling 24-hour race - proof, were it needed, that women have the physical and mental toughness to compete alongside men in motorsport.\n\n'It's dangerous enough in the daytime, but when you're racing there at night you have to drive with your nose. If you smell oil, then someone has leaked some and you have to be careful. If you smell freshly cut grass, then someone has spun off.'\n\nSchmitz already had a huge following in the motorworld and was able to drive some of the fastest cars in the world, something Clarkson and his co-presenters could not do\n\nFollowing the departure of Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, diehard Top Gear fans were ecstatic when Sabine was unveiled as one of the new presenters alongside Evans and US actor Matt LeBlanc.\n\nIt wasn't because she brought some much-needed gender balance to the show but because she already has a huge following among petrolheads. They know she can climb aboard the fastest, most powerful, most expensive road and race cars and drive them beyond their limits: something Clarkson, Hammond and May simply couldn't do.\n\nSchmitz and Clarkson go way back - she famously made him turn green while teaching him how to drive around the Nurburgring circuit in 2004. Clarkson then set a lap time in a Jaguar - a time Sabine demolished while driving the same car, and nearly beat in a humble Transit van.\n\nFollowing her appearance, she almost joined the show. 'I had some conversations with [then producer] Andy Wilman,' Sabine says. 'But a German girl on Clarkson's show? Could you imagine that? No way.\n\nSchmitz had to ask who Matt LeBlanc, left, was when she joined the show, but recognised his face when she Googled him. Right, Schmitz poses with Top Gear's The Stig\n\n'But when those three left the show there was another chance. And when the call came, I said yes straight away.'\n\nSo what did Sabine think when she was told that former Friends star LeBlanc would be one of her new colleagues?\n\n'When the BBC called to say they were going to announce that Matt LeBlanc would be one of the new hosts, I said, 'Who is Matt LeBlanc?' I don't have much time to watch television. I'd heard of Friends, of course, but I had to Google him. But when the results came up, I thought, 'Yes, I know that face.' '\n\nChris Evans, above on the show last series, will not be returning to the show. He stepped down saying his best shot was 'not enough'\n\nAlthough Evans will not be coming back for the new series, BBC insiders say the other presenters will return, and that the studio-based segments will be revamped. Pre-production is already under way and filming starts next month - not that Sabine is at a loose end. She has spent the summer at her farm near the Nurburgring, where she and her boyfriend, Klaus Abbelen, are building a Canadian-style log home. 'There's a chainsaw on my back seat right now,' she laughs.\n\nThere's a Porsche 911 GT3RS in her garage but her daily transport on the farm is a Ford Ranger Wildtrak pick-up truck and a Fendt tractor. 'I love my tractor. I actually love going slow,' she says.\n\nShe and Klaus also run the Frikadelli Racing team, and Sabine owns small chain of hotels near the Nurburgring, including one popular with Brits. They can store their cars there, and when they want to have some fast laps on the circuit, Sabine's team will collect them from the airport and take them straight to the pits, where their vehicle will be fuelled and ready.\n\nSchmitz, above, said she enjoyed working with Chris Evans in his time on the show and she hoped it wasn't her driving that made him leave\n\nFor the first post-Clarkson Top Gear series, Sabine flew out to a Top Gun air base in Nevada to recreate a dogfight with Evans in high-powered Corvettes and Vipers.\n\n'It was fun,' she says. 'But I was a bit worried when the Top Gun pilot started throwing up in my car. He was supposed to be one of the top pilots in the world, right? Shouldn't he be used to the G-forces?\n\n'I really enjoyed working with Chris and was sorry to hear that he wasn't coming back.\n\n'I just hope it wasn't my driving that made him leave.'", "Zapata Computing (www.zapatacomputing.com), a quantum software startup that spun out of Harvard University, today announced efforts to work with Google on its quantum computers as a Cirq integration partner.\n\nZapata has designed, from the ground up, a new algorithm called CUSP -- a quantum machine learning algorithm for building more efficient quantum circuits -- and implemented it for Google's quantum computers. CUSP draws upon the research by co-founder Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik, a pioneer in quantum simulation for chemistry and materials.\n\n\"We're excited that Zapata has been selected as one of the first companies to utilize Cirq and to work with Google's quantum computers,\" said Christopher Savoie, co-founder and CEO of Zapata. \"CUSP is a quantum circuit optimizer that dramatically improves quantum algorithm efficiency. This algorithm and others like it will hasten breakthroughs and enable the next generation of discoveries in chemistry, materials, and artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCUSP is an important tool when a quantum algorithm is too large to optimize by hand as it can automatically compress a computation to fit on near term quantum computers. It is one of the many powerful, hardware-agnostic algorithms that Zapata is currently developing for Fortune 1000 companies in markets such as finance, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Zapata's algorithms can run on the latest quantum hardware made by Google and other companies in this field.\n\nToday's announcement comes on the heels of other significant developments for Zapata this year, including an exclusive license agreement with Harvard's Office of Technology Development, and its initial round of funding from prominent investors that include The Engine, the venture firm founded by MIT to invest in tough tech startups.\n\nABOUT ZAPATA\n\nFounded in 2017 and based on technology developed at Harvard University, Zapata is building quantum software and algorithms to enable the next generation of accessible, commercial high-performance computing. Co-founded by Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik, a world leader in quantum simulation for chemistry and materials, Zapata's founding team includes Christopher Savoie, Yudong Cao, Jonathan Olson, Peter Johnson, and Jhonathan Romero. www.zapatacomputing.com\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180718005260/en/", "Most Wall Street analysts aren't concerned about the company's ability to pay the fine, but say Amazon will benefit the most from the decision.\n\nThe European competition regulator handed down a record-breaking fine of 4.3 billion euros (roughly $5.06 billion) to Alphabet's Google on Wednesday, accusing the search giant of abusing its dominant Android mobile-operating system to cement the popularity of Google apps and services.\n\nIt's the biggest antitrust fine ever given by European Union regulators against a single firm, cementing the reputation of the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as Silicon Valley's policewoman, Business Insider's Shona Ghosh reported.\n\nWhile most Wall Street analysts aren't concerned about Google's ability to pay the fine -- the penalty is equal to about 40% of Google's $12.62 billion profit in 2017 -- the scrapped deals with device makers could be a win for competitors, especially Amazon.\n\n\"This is a pro-Amazon ruling,\" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients out Wednesday. \"Overall, this ruling should have a limited direct impact on Google since it ostensibly does not force a change to the Google search algorithm, and it also seems relatively straight-forward for Google to comply.\"\n\nIt's a win for Amazon because of the extra step that will now be required for Android users to use a search engine that isn't Google, Sebastian said. It will also force Google to support \"forked\" versions of the open-source Android software that powers products like Amazon's Fire devices.\n\nBaird has an outperform rating for Alphabet, with a $1,300 price target on the stock -- 7% above where shares were trading Wednesday.\n\n\"We do not believe the fine (if ultimately paid) would have a material effect on Alphabet's business or its liquidity,\" analyst Heath Terry said in a note. \"The mandated changes to behavior may have a greater impact, but we cannot quantify that impact without knowing how Google will alter its operations, or whether it will be forced to comply pending appeals.\"\n\nGoldman remains \"buy\" rated on the stock, with a slightly lower price target of $1,250 per share.\n\n\"While the ruling contains a # of restrictions on pre-installed apps, we think it is unlikely to slow/deter the download/usage of Google's mobile app ecosystem (e.g., in the Apple App Store, Google has 9 of the top 50 apps despite no relationship with the underlying OS),\" analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note. \" In general, we think investors will react neutral to positive to this outcome.\"\n\nUBS is also \"buy\" rated, with a price target of $1,360 -- one of the highest on Wall Street.\n\n\"From a practical perspective, the consumers in Europe had already made their choice to use Google search as well as Chrome even before the switch from desktop to mobile had begun, as the company has been relentlessly focused on making its services better and raising the value proposition,\" analyst Stephen Ju said in a one paragraph note to clients. His price target is $1,213 for the stock.\n\n\"Google's various services have long ceased to be or never were default installs on iOS (YouTube and Maps at launch of the first series of iPhones), yet nevertheless Google was able to grow its installed base on mobile through the quality of its products. Hence, from a de-bundling impact perspective on the business, we expect minimal impact,\" he said.\n\nShares of Alphabet initially fell into the red following the ruling, but were up about 0.29% at 2:49 p.m. ET. Wall Street analyst polled by Bloomberg have an average price target of $1,261 for the stock, about 3.6% above Wednesday's prices.", "A Level 3 sex offender faces charges in Jonesboro and Osceola ...

I liked to think that there was someone I knew in every village.\n\n\"We also had a library in our central office in Liverpool and they kept every newspaper, every cutting of every story. If you wanted anything on a particular subject, the librarians would go and find it and fax it over. They were fantastic.\n\n\"I kept everything too - I remember a story about a tiny baby being born miles from anywhere in the middle of winter, the weight of a bag of sugar. She was wrapped up in cotton wool in the ambulance as it made its way slowly through the snow and ice across the moors, and she wasn't expected to survive.\n\n\"I did the story six months later when she left hospital, and then years later, I just happened to go through my cuttings and came across her story. I saw she would have been a few months from her 21st, so I rang around, contacted the local post office, and it turned out she was living a few minutes from my office.\n\n\"Having Google later was certainly useful.

She is now a member of Brick Court Chambers in London and has practised commercial law and international arbitration.\n\n\"As a junior barrister, you would get your instruction and you would have to do your own research - law reports, textbooks - and down to the libraries.

You have got to be careful.\n\n\"You also couldn't advertise in those days, so the idea of all this marketing was anathema. You built up relationships by doing your work well, and you would hope clients would come back.\"\n\nDecades ago, staff at the New York Public Library acted as a form of Human Google, taking questions from members of the public that they would then try to answer with the help of the vast resources at their disposal.\n\nIn recent years, staff there discovered a box of cards containing the public's questions, and shared them on the library's Instagram account.\n\n\"Where can I get all available statistics on volume of business, money involved, etc. in the sale of cadavers?\" one person asked in 1948.\n\nIn 2018, Google suggests this Reuters investigation into the trade in dead bodies in the US.\n\n\"Can mice throw up?\" one person wanted to know in 1949, for reasons that are unclear.\n\nPeople in 1949 had some strange questions about animals.

The latest is not a standalone application, but rather a drawing mini game for WeChat where machine learning plays a major role.\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nSimilar to Facebook Messenger, WeChat houses a lot of third-party functionality and services through mini apps. As one of China's most popular app stores with nearly a billion users, parent company Tencent also has notable footprints in payments, gaming and livestreaming.\n\nGoogle has now built one that is similar to its AI-powered Quick Draw game that it launched in 2016. Users are tasked with drawing an object that a neural network tries to recognize.\n\nThe name of the WeChat app roughly translates to \"Guessing Little Songs\" and gives users 20 seconds to doodle an assigned everyday item, like a dog, shoes, or watch. The AI then tries to guess the object, with users moving on to the next round if Google correctly identifies it.\n\nThe neural networking behind this game is powered by a dataset of 50 million hand-drawn sketches, and meant to showcase Google AI's advances in computer vision.\n\nA social aspect allows you to invite friends and family to see who can keep up the longest matching streak. Other features increasing sharing interesting sketches and saving drawings. The app can be installed via the below QR code.\n\nEarlier this year, Google and Tencent signed a cross-licensing deal to share parents and collaborate on future tech development. More recently Google announced an e-commerce deal with JD.com as a rumored means to sell smart speakers and other hardware in China. Meanwhile, consumer focussed efforts include Wear OS powered by local services and apps like Files Go and ARCore.\n\nAs evidenced by today's mini game, Google AI is also trying to stake a footprint by offering its TensorFlow machine learning library and tools to developers. Last year, it notably opened a Google AI China Center in Beijing.\n\nCheck out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:", "Groupon GRPN made headlines Tuesday after IBM announced a $167 million lawsuit for violation of four of its e-commerce IPs. The tech giant claims that while Amazon AMZN, Facebook FB, and Google GOOGL each pay between $20 million and $50 million for use of these technologies, Groupon has been using them without permission.\n\nShares of Groupon did not see significant movement on Tuesday and Wednesday as investors were unshaken by the latest in a series of back-and-forth exchanges between the two firms. IBM sued Groupon for the first time in 2016, alleging that it infringed on two server load-reducing systems as well as \"single sign-on\" technology, which allows consumers to use accounts from platforms such as Facebook FB or Google to sign in to their Groupon account.\n\nIs IBM Just a Patent Bully?\n\nIBM has won the most US patents in each of the last 25 years, receiving an astounding 9,043 last year alone, according to Bloomberg. The next closest company was Samsung, which received over 3,000 fewer patents in the same period. Groupon lawyer David Hadden told Bloomberg that these patents have fueled \"a business that it [IBM] doesn't talk about in its TV commercials.\" And he might be onto something.\n\nIn its most recent annual report, IBM highlighted intellectual property as a key value driver, alongside R&D and global markets. In 2017, Big Blue earned nearly $1.47 billion in income related to intellectual property. It also explained that a decline in IP income contributed to an overall decrease in annual revenue.\n\nIBM not only holds a large number of patents but is also not afraid to litigate over them. In recent years, it has sued or collected patent-related fees from Expedia EXPE, Twitter TWTR, Priceline -- which is now part of Booking Holdings BKNG -- and many others.\n\nIBM's argument is basically the reason there is patent law. However, it also has a track record of filing a patent for everything it possibly can.\n\nThe company came under fire last January when it was granted a patent for an \"out-of-office email system,\" as crazy as it sounds. IBM ultimately caved to the outrage and dedicated the patent to the public, agreeing not to enforce it.\n\nIt is difficult to comment on the nuts and bolts of the specific patents in question in the Groupon suit. However, past behavior reflects the very likely possibility that IBM is simply looking for new avenues for the monetization of its monstrously large patent portfolio.\n\nGroupon's Health\n\nNews broke earlier this month that Groupon is currently on the block and looking for a buyout offer. Management may see this as the best way out given that its shares are down nearly 82% since its November 2011 IPO.\n\nProfitability is a big issue for Groupon, which has seen sideways income movement in the last few years, as we can see below:\n\nWhile management has been working toward improving figures and cutting losses, the company is not earning much money. Still, it is leveraging new partnerships, including one with Universal Orlando.\n\nGroupon's key initiative is its transition from a deals company to a marketplace firm. It has also cut down its international exposure from 47 to 15 countries, and now focuses on three main areas: marketing, international, and shopping.\n\nThe company beat earnings and revenues estimates last quarter, but saw year-over-year setbacks. Yet, the firm raised its full-year 2018 guidance, and now expects adjusted EBITDA of $280-$290 million compared to the previous projection of $260-$270 million.\n\nStory Continues\n\nCould This Hinder a Potential Groupon Acquisition?\n\nTheoretically, a firm caught in extended litigation may not seem like an inherently attractive buyout target. But given the prolonged battle with IBM, and past trends, the market doesn't seem to mind. In fact, Groupon ticked up 1.7% to $4.72 per share by the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\nWhen IBM decided to sue Expedia earlier this year, it was targeting both it and Orbitz, which Expedia acquired in 2014. Big Blue claimed that it had first reached out to Orbitz regarding patent issues in 2011, but was unable to negotiate. Worth noting is that Expedia knew about the situation before deciding to complete the acquisition, meaning that it too did not see it as a big enough threat .\n\nGroupon appears to be poised in a similar position. Some of the patents that IBM is claiming are being violated date back to the early days of the internet, and are the same patents that it has used in previous arguments. Both firms will likely continue to duke it out in court for a few more years before ultimately settling on a much more reasonable figure than the initial $167 million.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIBM, like other former tech giants, is in a fight to catch up with the times. In the face of declining revenues, the firm needs as many sources of income as possible.\n\nGroupon, on the other hand, must also tackle its own challenges. Solid recent performance has led to positive earnings estimate revisions for the following quarter, current fiscal year, and following fiscal year. This leaves Groupon sitting at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). But while the firm's new strategic shift and growth initiatives are steps in the right direction, it will take some time before we can determine if they will pay off.\n\nInvestors should continue to monitor Groupon's efforts to boost profitability and any IBM updates because there is still plenty of space for optimism, and some potentially interesting plays to be made over the next few months.\n\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\n\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

But whenever I was with him, I felt that he was the giant.\n\nThat's what the bestselling Harvard business professor, Clayton Christensen, wrote about the former Intel chief executive when he passed away in 2017. Christensen, who coined the term \"disruptive technology\", said he would most miss Grove's ability to understand how a complex organisation works, and to wield it to Intel's advantage.\n\nIt allowed Grove, who started at the company the day it was incorporated on July 18, 1968, to famously re-orient the business in the 1980s. Intel shifted away from memory chips for mainframe computers towards the microprocessor - the engine that spurs into motion when you turn on your computer.\n\nPropelled by a deal with IBM to put Intel processors into all its personal computers, the company came to provide Silicon Valley with one of its most essential technologies. Intel Inside and the accompanying jingle became one of the most memorable advertising slogans of the modern era.\n\nEven after five decades of dominance, no other company in the world can produce a better and faster microprocessor. Intel is at the pinnacle of an industry that manages to engineer miracles like no other. We tend to perceive innovation as something uncertain, particularly where it's so reliant on scientists to drive it forward. Yet Intel is anything but ambiguous. It has released successive advances in processor engineering like clockwork.\n\nIn 1965, future co-founder Gordon Moore made a bold prediction about the exponential growth of computing power. He predicted that the number of microchip transistors etched into a fixed area of a computer microprocessor would double every two years - and so, therefore, would computing power. Intel has since delivered on this improbable promise, immortalising \"Moore's law\".\n\nIt's difficult for anyone to fathom the effects of exponential growth. But it is why a single iPhone today possesses many times more computing power than the entire spacecraft for the NASA Apollo moon mission of 1969. Without Moore's law, there would be no Google, no Facebook, no Uber, no Airbnb. Silicon Valley would be like any other valley.\n\nThe Big Miss\n\nAnd yet, the iPhone is also what Intel missed. Immediately after the company won Apple's Mac business in 2005, Steve Jobs came asking for another chip for his smartphone. Intel certainly wanted to dominate this emerging sector but the price Jobs was offering was below its forecasted cost and it misjudged the size of the iPhone market. The company passed.\n\nApple had no choice but to build its own chipsets by licensing technologies from ARM, a British-based company controlled by Japanese interests. If Apple and its iPhone had been the only competitors, Intel might have been able to gradually adapt. But Google came in soon after with Android, a free operating system that Samsung, Huawei and HTC all adopted. Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments, all licensed by ARM, became the phone makers' go-to suppliers for energy-efficient, low-cost computing devices.\n\nThese American rivals are not trying to beat Intel. Qualcomm specialises in mobile phones and Nvidia specialises in graphics in video games. They all outsource production to third parties in Asia. But an Intel microprocessor sells for around US$100 while ARM-based chips sell for around US$10, and often less than a dollar. That's how ARM-based designs are now found in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.\n\nIn other words, Intel failed to compete in smartphones against those who have far less resources. It's a great irony when you reflect that Grove once invited Christensen to the Intel HQ in Santa Clara, California, to explain his theory on disruption. Grove later credited the meeting as the main driver for Intel's decision to launch the Celeron chip in 1998, a cheap product aimed at low-end PCs, which within a year captured 35% of the market.\n\nThe New Goldrush\n\nNow the big question is whether Intel is repeating its previous mistake with iPhones - this time in driverless cars. Last March it purchasedMobileye, an Israeli company that makes digital vision technology, for US$15.3 billion. It was a big bet in a sector that has huge potential: as autonomous driving takes off, vehicles are becoming computers on wheels. They will require more and more microchips and Intel hopes to dominate.\n\nExcept for one glitch. Everything Intel has done in the last 50 years is geared towards general purpose, high-end chipsets. Its integrated model - where the company designs and manufactures its processors - means it absorbs an enormous amount of fixed cost, in research and design as well as manufacturing.\n\nThe only way to offset these burdens is to sell a high volume of devices at high margins. The result is that the company is obsessed with technological progress, but has a rigid business model which limits what it can and cannot do. There's a monster inside Intel with a ferocious appetite.\n\nBut what if autonomous driving doesn't actually require the computing power Intel is counting on? This is the competing vision of Huawei. When I recently visited Shenzhen, executives from the Chinese telecom giant explained to me that much of the city's infrastructure will be digitalised and that Huawei will saturate it with a 5G network. This will drastically reduce any speed and latency problems for computers.\n\nThis means the computing inside cars can be mostly offloaded to the city's infrastructure. It is a radical vision, but clearly a viable alternative. The implication is that a BMW or Toyota doesn't need that many high-end chipsets after all. It's smartphones all over again.\n\nChristensen's insight was that successful companies die not because of complacency to change.

Conservatives, Labour and Green Party for submitting spending returns missing invoicesTories and the Lib Dems for making multiple payments to suppliers whose payment claims were lateWomen's Equality Party for submitting a spending return that was inconsistent with its donation reportsAnti-Brexit group Best for Britain for a spending return that was missing invoices. Best for Britain for not returning a \u00a325,000 donation from an impermissible donor within 30 daysNational Union for Teachers for submitting a spending return missing an invoice\n\nSome \u00a34million went to CTF Partners Limited, the firm of election guru Sir Lynton Crosby. More than \u00a3900 was spent by the party with Deliveroo.\n\nThe Lib Dems paid Disney Cruise Line more than \u00a32,500 - apparently after a member of staff was forced to cancel a holiday due to the unexpected poll.\n\nBob Posner of the Electoral Commission said: 'It is vital that voters are given an opportunity to see accurate and full reportable data on what parties and campaigners spent money on in order to influence them at last year's general election.\n\n'This provides transparency in the political finance system and is open for anyone to scrutinise.\n\n'We are investigating possible breaches of the rules.\n\n'However, our on-going discussions with the major parties indicate to us that they may wish to consider the robustness of their internal governance and level of resourcing to ensure they can deliver what the law requires.'\n\nThe total spend of \u00a340million by the major parties and political groups for the election last year was higher than in 2015.\n\nHowever, it is lower than the 2005 battle.\n\nTheresa May (pictured in Birmingham today) called the snap election in a bid to get a bigger mandate - but ended up losing her overall majority\n\nThe Tories' previous record spend was just below \u00a318million in 2005.\n\nToday's figures also lay bare how the parties spent their election war chests fighting the campaign.\n\nIt shows that \u00a313.4million - the equivalent of over a third of the total spend - was spent on unsolicited material like leaflets.\n\nWhile over \u00a310m was spent on advertising and \u00a37.364m was spent on market research while \u00a31.685m was spent on rallies.\n\nWhat were some of the things the political parties spent money on?\n\nDeliveroo: Tories forked out \u00a3944.10 on orders\n\nDisney cruise: Lib Dems spent \u00a32,794 to cover the cost of a cruise which had to be canceled when the election was called\n\nHair and make-up: Tories spent \u00a32,287 on a beauty firm\n\nPrivate jets: Tories spent \u00a3369,193 on the flights\n\nBalloons: All poitical parties spent a total of \u00a32,798.75 on balloons\n\nParanormal expert: Tories spent \u00a34,500 on consultancy fees on Conservative MEP, Rupert Matthews - an expert on ghosts and UFOs. The money went on campaign consultancy.\n\nThe amount political parties has spent on market research has soared in recent elections - leaping from \u00a31.854m in 2010 to \u00a37.364m in 2017.\n\nTheresa May called the snap General Election last spring while she was riding high in the polls and pundits were predicting she would win a landslide.\n\nBut her election campaign was widely seen as one of the worst ever - characterise by dull stump speeches made by Mrs May and with few other ministers allowed to actively campaign nationally.\n\nTory manifesto pledges to axe the triple lock on pensions, allow a free vote to bring back fox hunting, and a pledge to reintroduce grammar schools, all proved deeply unpopular with voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn's manifesto - dubbed the most left-wing in a generations - promised to turn the spending taps on and pump many billions into public services.\n\nHe also pledged to scrap university tuition fees in a promise which proved extremely popular with younger voters.\n\nWhen Mrs May lost her majority in the shock election result, she spent several days clinging on to her leadership by a whisker - with Tory MPs openly calling for her to go.\n\nShe managed to stay on as Prime Minister only after getting rid of her two closest but highly controversial advisers - Nick Timothy and Fional Hill.\n\nAnd she had to promise to pump an extra \u00a31billion into Northern Ireland as part of a confidence and supply deal to get the DUP's ten MPs to prop her up in Downing Street.\n\nJeremy Corbyn emerged from the election with his popularity at a new high - and received a rapturous reception from the crowd at Glastonbury in June (pictured)\n\nMrs May's tenure of the Tory Party has been dogged by rumours she will face a leadership challenge by other Cabinet ministers.\n\nBut she has vowed to stay on as Tory leader and Prime Minister as long as the party wants her too.\n\nAnd the Conservatives have struggled to find a candidate that would be able to unify Ramainers and Brexiteers.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Corbyn's surprise strong performance in the election managed to silence his many critics in the Labour Party for a time.\n\nBut splits have reemerged in recent weeks as Labour moderates have torn into the left-wing leader over his lukewarm criticism of the Kremlin in the wake of the Salisbury spy poison outrage.\n\nFormer Russian spy Sergei Skripal andhis daughter Yulia are both fighting for their lives in hospital after being poisoned by the nerve agent Novichok.", "You miss the little things you once took for granted when you leave your hometown.\n\nEverything changes once you take off and start somewhere new. When you first land, it's normal to feel anxious, scared, maybe even a little sick to your stomach, and excited. Then you blink and months fly by as your feet get firmly planted in your new surroundings. Every day your life starts slowly piecing itself together like the stills of a stop-motion movie.\n\nIf you only stop and take a moment to reflect, here are some of the beautiful things you might realize once you've left your old life behind:\n\nNoises you used to hear every day become foreign to you. From the little \"beep\" noise the MetroCard makes when you swipe to the sound the pedestrian crossing signal annoyingly chirps, you'll long for all the sounds that used to piss you off. When I moved across the country from NYC to Los Angeles, I clung to my MetroCard even though I used to despise all that it symbolized -- brawls in the subway, 3 a.m. throw up, and homeless men's strip shows. And if you're anything like me, you definitely miss the steal that is drunk $1 pizza and all the little things you used to overlook.\n\nWhen you move away by yourself, you learn to lick your wounds on your own. There is no hand-holding when you break out alone. Independence is yours now, and you've learned to survive. Making money, investing in stocks, and making rent take priority over anything else. Now you have new friends, but you made them after becoming your own best friend first and foremost.\n\nWhen you move, you have to rebuild everything. During this process, you learn new skills. You learn to do laundry, drive (maybe even like a NASCAR driver), and actually start liking the person you see in the mirror. You learn to love and take care of yourself in new ways, both big and small.\n\nDistance from your childhood and lifelong pals makes your heart grow bigger and softer. Along your journey of rebuilding your life, you make new friends but never forget your old ones. Since you were very vulnerable and alone when you first unpacked your boxes or suitcases, you meet the best kind of people, the ones who are welcoming and natural nurturers. These rare gems have souls that will be there for you through thick and thin. It may sound cliche, but they really do become your family -- especially when you have no one to spend Christmas with, and they invite you over to watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas and stuff your face.\n\nI'm not going to lie -- I do get homesick from time to time. I never thought I would do this, but sometimes I look up pictures of my old place on Google satellites or scan multiple GIFs of NYC at my desk in Universal City. But then a visit back quickly reminds me that the thought of home is very different than actually being home. The reality of the past looks a lot shinier than the present, and returning never feels as good as the actual thought of coming home. If you ever return to see all the people and places you've missed while away, you'll likely realize why you left in the first place. Going home can be very nostalgic, but like your childhood Reptar slippers, that \"home\" no longer fits. You've simply outgrown it and are better off for it.", "On Monday, IBM asked a jury to award the company $167 million in a lawsuit against deals site Groupon for using patented technology without authorization.

They do not have time for their health, let alone visit a doctor. Here enters the DocsApp, an online consultation mobile app that connects doctors to patients through chat or calls.\n\nFriends and founders of the startup, Satish Kannan and Enbasekar Dinadayalane came up with the idea to launch the app in 2015 after they noticed the uneven distribution of specialists in the country. Satish, an alumnus of IIT Madras, realised this when he was developing a cardiac surgery machine for an MNC. \"In India, out of seven lakh doctors, only a lakh specialise in a field. Of them, 10 per cent work in tier I cities, and this results in a shortage of specialists in small towns,\" says Satish.\n\nThe app's launch was preceded by a year-long research. DocsApp is an overall health consultation platform, which aims to provide quality healthcare facilities to people in small towns. It has self-evaluation tests through which the users can know their potential health hazards. It has an internal panel of doctors who help in the selection of nearest specialist in gynaecology, oncology, dermatology.\n\n\"We follow a three-step process to select doctors. We verify their MCI (Medical Council of India) registration number followed by a round of interview with our doctor panel. We also visit the doctors in person to avoid taking quacks onboard,\" he says. He adds that most of the specialists are from Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Mumbai.\n\nThe app also points to the nearest National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories for tests. \"The app will send reminder texts to the users if they fail to undergo the test or consult doctors within three days after the test,\" Satish says. But getting people to connect with doctors online was a task for them. \"It was difficult to convince people to go online to consult doctors. It was hard for them to trust the authenticity of the information provided through the app,\" he says.\n\nThe developers wanted the app to be user-friendly. \"As most smartphone owners use WhatsApp, we decided to have a similar interface. Our app also supports 16 local languages,\" he adds. DocsApp has raised $8.4 million so far.\n\n\"Till date, we had two rounds of funding. We raised around $1.2 million (Rs 8+ crore) from a Japanese company, VC Rebright Partners, and other Indian investors during the seed funding stage,\" he shares. Then they raised around $7.2 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and Japanese investors as their Series A funding. They charge a percentage of the online payment made by the users to earn their revenue.\n\nSatish has a team of 120 in Bengaluru. \"We also have two or three members in each state to look after the functioning of the app,\" he adds. DocsApp users are equally divided in tier I and tier II cities.\n\n\"We use Google and Facebook to advertise in tier I cities. But in tier II cities we follow a referral method where a user recommends the app to his or her friends and family,\" says Satish. The app currently caters to 75,000 patients and aims to reach three lakh patients in a year and 10 lakh patients in three years.", "A potential eight-week stay in the Love Island villa may well spark romance for incoming contestant Niall Aslam.\n\nBut the 23-year old student insists he already has his heart set on TV presenter Amanda Holden, 47, and admits he's perplexed by the wave of criticism she receives for wearing racy, revealing outfits on Britain's Got Talent.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'It annoys me a bit that everyone is always rating Alesha Dixon and Amanda is coming out week-by-week in these sick, fiery dresses, with a bit of cleavage on show and no-one is rating her.

She's fire and no-one clocks it, and it gets me annoyed.'\n\nAnd Niall - one of ten new Islanders to enter the remote Majorcan villa - has already visualized a rather questionable ideal first date with the married mother of three.\n\n'She'd get picked up in a Fiesta and taken for a Nando's!' he told MailOnline. 'Let's see if she's on that.'\n\nDream woman: The student, 23, has his heart set on Amanda Holden, 47, and admits he's perplexed by the wave of criticism she receives for wearing racy outfits on Britain's Got Talent\n\nThe Birmingham based student hopes his outgoing personality will win him a new legion of fans when the show launches on Monday evening, but he remains uncertain about the prospect of being a one-woman man during his time in the villa.\n\n'Listen anything can happen in there - it seems like a mad place,' he explained. 'If I found someone, yeah great. But if I'm with the love of my life and you put Amanda Holden in then who knows?\n\n'I'm not thinking ahead because I think you can get carried away. At the moment, I'm thinking I'm going in and getting pied off and that's as far as it goes.\n\n'I'm not thinking I'll do XYZ, sell teeth whitening kits and protein shakes. I'm just going in and I'll see what happens day by day.'\n\nNot a fan: Niall said of last year's Islander Camilla Thurlow [pictured with Jamie Jewitt] 'It did seem like she was in the wrong queue, maybe or Antiques Roadshow or something'\n\nAlready a fan of the show, Niall knows that any decision to swap partners may well result in comparisons with Jonny Mitchell, who was heavily criticized after famously dumping Camilla Thurlow for Tyla Carr in 2017 - a move he has since admitted to regretting.\n\n'I thought he got a hard time last year, to be honest with you, everyone was absolutely sending for him,' he said. 'I was scrolling his Instagram for a long time and all I saw was snakes. At the end of the day, fair enough everyone rated Camilla, but it's Love Island and obviously he preferred Tyla.\n\n'I liked Camilla but it did seem like she was in the wrong queue, maybe or Antiques Roadshow or something. I'm not sending for her, but it did. Like Dickinson's Real Deal. It's Love Island and she lost her head when she kissed him? Nah.'\n\nInteresting choice: Despite having never read a book by JK Rowling, Niall admits to being such a huge fan of the Harry Potter film franchise he's got a Hermione Grainger's wand tattoo\n\nDespite having never read a book by JK Rowling, Niall admits to being a huge fan of the Harry Potter film franchise, so much so that he opted to get Hermione Grainger's distinctive wand permanently inked onto his left arm.\n\n'I wanted to get a wand and really I would have liked Harry Potter's, but if you Google it, his is just a stick - there's nothing on it,' he explained. 'If you look at it, Hermoine's has got loads of cool stuff on it.\n\n'It's done well and it's tasteful - I wouldn't just get a big fat wand on my arm. The only other cool one is Voldemort, but you don't want to be that guy.'\n\nThe inking has also prompted inevitable speculation that his Love Island chat up line will be 'Do you want to see my wand' - and he admits that he may well use it, albeit with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\n'That's like a power move,' he added. 'If all else fails, I'll just hit on with that and see what happens.

Google immediately said it would appeal the fine\n\n\"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less,\" Google spokesman Al Verney said in a statement. \"A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition. We will appeal the Commission's decision.\"\n\nDanish former minister Vestager spoke by telephone with Google chief Sundar Pichai on Tuesday night to tell him about the decision in advance.\n\nVestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser, thereby freezing out rivals.\n\nThey were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. Google Search and Chrome are as a result pre-installed on the \"significant majority\" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says. Google also prevented manufacturers from selling smartphones that run on rival operating systems based on the Android open source code, it said.\n\nGoogle finally gave \"financial incentives\" to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they pre-installed Google Search on their devices, the commission said.\n\nGoogle provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.\n\nUnder EU rules Google could have been fined up to 10 percent of parent company Alphabet's annual revenue, which hit $110.9 billion in 2017.\n\nVestager's campaign against Silicon Valley giants in her four years as the 28-nation European Union's competition commissioner has won praise in Europe but angered Washington.\n\nBrussels has repeatedly targeted Google over the past decade amid concerns about the Silicon Valley giant's dominance of internet search across Europe, where it commands about 90 percent of the market.\n\nAs well as the Android and Google Shopping files, it also has a third investigation under way, into Google's AdSense advert-placing business.\n\nVestager's other major scalps include Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe EU ordered Apple in 2016 to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in back taxes that the maker of iPhones and iPads had avoided by a tax deal with Dublin.\n\nIt has also taken on Facebook over privacy issues after it admitted that millions of users may have had their data hijacked by British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which was working for Trump's 2016 election campaign.\n\nBut Brussels has had US tech giants in its sights for a decade in a half, since it imposed a huge 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 for anti-competitive behaviour and ruled it must make changes to its Windows system.\n\nThe Google decision comes just one week before European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is due to travel to the United States for crucial talks with Trump on the tariffs dispute and other issues. Transatlantic tensions are also high over Trump's berating NATO allies on defence spending at a summit last week, over his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and over the US president's pull-out from the Iran nuclear agreement and Paris climate deal.", "In recent news, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL was hit by a record-breaking $5 billion fine by EU regulators for breaking antitrust laws. According to The New York Times, this steep antitrust penalty is among one of the most aggressive regulatory moves ever made against an American technology company. The fine comes from Google abusing its Android market dominance in three different areas. The three areas outlined include Google bundling its search engine and Chrome apps into the operating system; blocking phone makers from creating devices that run forked versions of Android; and paying large manufacturers to bundle the Google search app on handsets, according to The Verge.\n\nWhat this Fine Means for Google\n\nThis is the second time Google has been fined. They were fined last year by the EU for about $2.8 billion over the company's unfair favoring of its own services. However, this time around, European authorities are more aggressive towards regulating technology firms in areas related to antitrust, privacy, and the spread of misinformation.\n\nThe European Commission wants Google to put an end to their illegal conduct within 90 days of the decision. However, Google plans to appeal the decision, as they believe Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. At this point, the company does not seem worried. Seeing as this has happened before and since Google wants to appeal, this case could go on for years.\n\nAt this point, Google will have to deposit a fine which will be held during the legal process. If Google loses the appeal, then the fine will end up being distributed amongst the EU's member states.\n\nCurrently, GOOGL's stock has fallen 0.24% with little fluctuation since the news of the fine. Since Google was first fined by the EU last year, they have been investigating Android more closely after rivals complained that Google was dominating the market. However, if you look at GOOGL's revenue over the past year, it has grown from around $75 billion to $111 billion. Even with this fine in place, customers still want to buy Google's services and products and remain loyal.\n\nSimilar Cases in the Past\n\nMany cases like this one have occurred in the past, with the same problem at hand. Similarly,, many large tech firms like Facebook FB, Intel INTC, and Microsoft MSFT have all received antitrust fines from the EU. Like Google, Microsoft was fined twice in the past after the company didn't include a browser ballot in one of its new Windows updates. However, it could be possible that this ruling is swept under the rug, seeing as Europe is the only one who acted alone in taking action against these Silicon Valley companies. In the past, regulators in the US have given companies innovative freedom and allowed tech companies to expand the way they want to.\n\nAlthough there are certain restrictions and regulations for every company, no one has really had a big issue with any company, especially within the United States in the past.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs of now, all Google can do is wait this out since they have already decided to appeal the decision made by the commission. The company itself is doing well amongst its customers, and not reeling from any revenue losses at the moment.\n\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\n\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

Muhammad Ali. No disrespect though but why can't he stand now?'\n\nUnfortunate question: Maria Fowler incurred the irritation of Jamal Edwards wehn she asked Twitter why Muhammad Ali couldn't stand during the Olympics Opening Ceremony\n\nTook to Twitter: Maria might have been wise to Google before asking her followers\n\nShe was immediately met with incredulity from SB.TV founder Jamal Edwards, who tweeted: 'You are so DUMB!'\n\nHe said: 'If I don't know a question I would go on the net first to find out especially what I'm talking about. Not go to Twitter & ask. @mariafowler'\n\nJamal then tweeted a picture of the TOWIE star on a ride during a recent trip to Alton Towers, writing: 'Oi you pig!'\n\nNo patience: SB.TV founder Jamal Edwards called Maria 'dumb' after he read her question\n\nHad a rant: Jamal was clearly not impressed by Maria's ignorance, and didn't hold back with his comments\n\nMaria added: I did google and couldn't know why. Parkinson's is so sad. I lost my grandad to Parkinson's. Ali is a legend x\n\nShe then retaliated, tweeting Jamal: 'had to google u too but not much came up. Goat'\n\nHe retweeted her post- which she has since deleted, writing: 'I put in work! What do you do? Your famous for no reason S***!'\n\nResponded: Maria tried to backtrack a little after Jamal's persistent criticism\n\nUnkind: Jamal tweeted Maria this snap of her from a recent trip to Alton Tow\n\n'How could you not know why? I can't stand @mariafowler after them foolish comments there. No respect.\n\nMaria then wrote to him: 'hahaha exactly. Sit on my arse and richer than u probs #LikeISaidYouAreAGoat #INTERNETTROLL '\n\nShe has since deleted that tweet as well, however she took to her page to send a message to her followers after the spat.\n\nTook a stand: Maria said that she was going to do something about internet 'bullies'\n\nMaria said: 'Right I am seriously going to see what can be done about Internet bullies. It's pathetic how people can be filled with such hate.'\n\n'Actually sickens me the vile comments that get written on here. I actually would back any campaign to combat this. I am disgusted,' she continued.\n\nReturn to the Olympic stage: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali is helped during the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games", "Above: The HyperX Pulsefire Surge is the company's first RGB gaming mouse.\n\nHyperX has jumped into the RGB lifestyle with the Alloy Elite keyboard and its NGenuity software, and the company now wants its fans to start pairing that with the Pulsefire Surge mouse. This is the RGB LED version of its gaming mouse, which features a Pixart 3389 optical sensor, Omron switches, and onboard memory. It is available now for $70.\n\nAs with other HyperX products, it is obvious that the engineering team put a lot of thought into how gamers actually use products like this. And then they made it really nice to look at on top of that.\n\nAttractive design\n\nThe HyperX Pulsefire Surge is quite beautiful. It uses a shiny black plastic for its body that looks premium and feels great, but then HyperX accentuates tat with a wraparound programmable LED array. This thin strip goes all the way around the mouse for a full 360-degree effect, and it just looks eyepopping when you first see it.\n\nIf you pair it with HyperX's relatively new NGenuity software, you can set the lights to do whatever you want. You can also add profiles so that the lights react differently depending on what you're doing.\n\nAnd since I also think the HyperX Alloy Elite RGB is wonderful and has everything you need from a mechanical keyboard, you have a viable option for syncing up the LEDs across multiple devices.\n\nAccurate gaming performance\n\nThe Pulsefire Surge uses the same Pixart 3389 optical sensor that was in the previous HyperX mouse. This is also similar to what you'll find in most competing high-end mice from competitors. It is capable of updating 1,000 times per second, and it is as precise as anything else on the market.\n\nThe sliding action of the Pulsefire Surge is also especially nice thanks to some oversized gliding pads on the bottom. They are smooth enough to skate across most surfaces, but HyperX of course has a selection of mouse pads that they work even better with.\n\nHyperX transparency\n\nWhen I do consumer reviews for something like a mouse, I try to always think about using it in the real world. What that means is that I try to prioritize why you'll love or hate owning something as opposed to the buzzwords and highlight features that make you want to go out and buy something.\n\nBut I do want to give credit to HyperX for the way it sells the Pulsefire Surge. If you go out to buy a gaming mouse from a company like SteelSeries, Logitech, or Razer, you'll get a lot of marketing speak from those companies, but it's difficult to find out what is actually inside of those devices. HyperX, however, is refreshingly transparent. It lists the critical components that is uses right on its product page. In fact, if you search Google for the Pulsefire Surge, the snippet for the first result tells you that it has a Pixart 3389 sensor.\n\nAnd nearly every gaming mouse uses a similar sensor, some have higher DPIs, but they're all the same class of Pixart components. HyperX is the only company that will just come out and tell you that in its marketing material, and I find that commendable.\n\nBody is too short for larger hands\n\nThe Pulsefire Surge is a bit too short. I get why this makes sense for most companies -- bigger hands have an easier time adjusting to smaller mice than the other way around. But I felt some cramping in the middle of my palm when trying to use the Surge for extended periods of time.\n\nI could avoid that fatigue by relaxing and focusing on using just my fingers to hold the mouse, but that is not my natural stance. Now, I don't think the Pulsefire Surge is too big overall. It's probably the right width. But I prefer something longer, and I think that popular mice from companies like Logitech show that a lot of other people feel the same way.\n\nHyperX NGenuity software needs work\n\nYou can tell that HyperX is new to this kind of software service. NGenuity is slow and unresponsive. I also think it's a big confusing when it comes to figuring out exactly how to change some settings. I've also had it bug out on me when trying to update. I have faith that HyperX will get there, but I'm not gonna ask anyone else to take that for granted. As of now, NGenuity is frustrating.\n\nI'm a fan of HyperX's work. It's easy for companies to think they can come in and make an easy buck in the high profit-margin world of PC gaming peripherals, but HyperX always makes a real effort to build a legitimately impressive product. And that shines through once again with the Pulsefire Surge.\n\nIf you aren't someone who needs to fiddle in the software for your mouse a lot, the Surge has no downsides besides its length. And you may not prefer an extra-long mouse the way I do. So I recommend the Pulsefire Surge with the assumption that you can get your hands on it for yourself first or you buy it somewhere with a friendly exchange policy.", "1.

The 2018 poll also revealed that 82 percent of respondents report being unlikely to plan a trip to Cuba (a six percent increase from 2017).\n\nThe survey asked Americans about the recent news of major US airlines expanding service between the United States and Cuba and cruise lines adding more Cuban ports to their itineraries. Only 18 percent of Americans are more interested in visiting the country as a result of these new developments, while eight percent report feeling less interested in visiting Cuba. Almost three-fourths (73 percent) indicated that they were unaffected by this news.\n\nAccording to the survey results, many Americans feel uncertain about the legality and logistics of traveling to Cuba. In the wake of revised restrictions for US travelers, as well as the elimination of individual \"people-to-people\" cultural exchange trips, the survey found that many Americans are confused about whether, and how, they can legally travel to the Caribbean nation. A staggering 55 percent of American survey respondents do not understand the current restrictions on travel to Cuba.\n\nUS travel to Cuba for the purpose of pure tourism was banned by the US government in 1963. It is still not permitted under US or Cuban law - American travelers' reasons for visiting Cuba must generally fall within one of these 12 categories of authorized travel.\n\nThe 2018 survey also measured American sentiment regarding Cuba, revealing that 38 percent of American respondents believe that Cuba has changed for the better since travel restrictions to the country were eased. This represents a four percent increase in Americans expressing this belief, up from 34 percent in the 2017 survey.\n\n\"Our survey found that only one percent of Americans think they will go to Cuba in the next six months, two percent believe they will make it there by the end of 2018 and five percent think they will go sometime in 2019,\" said Daniel Durazo, director of communications at Allianz Global Assistance USA. \"Despite airlines and cruise lines expanding their services to Cuba, there still seems to be confusion regarding the current travel restrictions to the country.\"", "There's a reason investors aren't reacting more strongly to the trade war.\n\nMonths ago, the market would swing wildly as trade tensions heightened.

I cannot understand why the EU has imposed such a mad, perverse ruling.'\n\nSo far only one major insurer has released details of its price increases. Allianz said its premiums would rise 13 per cent for women aged 26, and on average by four per cent for all female customers.\n\nOther insurers are expected to reveal higher rises as Allianz does not insure the high-risk under-26s.\n\nAdvert: Sheila's Wheels, which currently insures well over half a million female policyholders, is one firm that will will implement gender-neutral pricing\n\nMen under 22 have ten times as many serious crashes than women of the same age. They are also 25 times more likely to commit driving offences and twice as prone to making a claim.\n\nA woman under 22 now pays about \u00a31,800 for insurance, compared with \u00a33,162 for men. Consumer Intelligence, which tracks prices, said young women who live in high crime areas and drive expensive cars could pay up to \u00a33,000 more.\n\nKelly Wright, 23, from Salford, Greater Manchester faces a hike from \u00a3890 a year to about \u00a31,600.\n\nUnfair: Drivers say it is not right that some women drivers will now fall into the same bracket as 'boy racers' (file picture)\n\nShe said: 'I cannot afford this increase so would have to give up my car and therefore my job. It offends me that I will be in the same bracket as boy racers.'\n\nResearch found that 90 per cent of people were unaware of the price hikes. Consumer Intelligence urged women to renew their cover before December 21.\n\nChief executive Ian Hughes said: 'They might have to pay a penalty for exiting their policy early, but it will still probably be cheaper.'\n\nThe Association of British Insurers said: 'We are sure this is not the best route to go down. Insurance is all about price and risk.\n\n'We will have to ignore decades of data.'", "Ten young Malaysians are just one step away from making it to the Allianz Junior Football Camp (AJFC) in Munich, Germany this August.\n\nMuhammad Adam Nadzmi Zamri and Daniel Phoon Chun Tuck from Penang, Muhammad Ashriq Izzat Mazlan,Muhammad Akmal Abdul Rashid and Muhammad Hafiz Izzudin Az-Har from Kedah, Mohamad Khairol Syafiq Hairol Azri from Pahang, Mohammad Zharmien Ashraf Ismail from Sarawak as well as Kumaran Raman, Eisanraaj K.

For some today it's not so easy - Time out: Almost Heaven... on a bun - Trump reportedly wanted Russia charges pre-summit - Roby rolls to victory despite past trump criticism - Smells like schnitzel\n\nPUTIN OR THE DEMOCRATS? FOR SOME TODAY IT'S NOT SO EASY\n\nWe seldom notice the way that technology changes us. It happens gradually and, as individuals, we tend to be poor observers of our own behavior.\n\nThat goes for politics, too. Think, for example, how the technologies of ultrasound and neo-natal care have shifted the discussion about elective abortions after the first trimester.\n\nBut technology also changes the business of politics. Much of the work of campaigns and elections used to be hunches and gut instincts. We've only had modern polling past 60 years or so, and for most of that time what surveys could reveal was pretty limited.\n\nBut in the past three decades, the same kinds of market research tools that big companies use to try to sell you fish sticks and Fords became part of politics. As data was changing the way we do everything, it was changing politics, too.\n\nThe dawn of the digital age kicked that all into overdrive. Campaigns used to have to guess at what voters wanted. Now voters go online and by their blabbing and the digital breadcrumbs they leave behind from their searches and page preferences show campaigns who they are and how to best persuade them.\n\nThe ability to both identify and persuade voters has been a substantial factor in what's moving Americans apart these days. Thanks to being able to chop the electorate into such tiny pieces, candidates are able to put together winning coalitions without having to do much persuading.\n\nThe time when candidates felt obliged to have a broad-spectrum message is fading in favor of building and maintaining a political base.\n\nAside from the obvious cultural damage that it does to divide and divide and divide and divide voters, it also has some very unhappy consequences as it comes to the politicians themselves.\n\nNo politician has embraced the concept of base politics with the vigor of Donald Trump. He knows what his voters want and he is determined to give it to them. And if that enrages Democrats and turns off moderates, so much the better.\n\nTrump's obsessive base maintenance has helped him in governance at many points. His Supreme Court picks and tax cuts are aimed at keeping faith with the folks who elected him. And whether you like them or not, Trump's immigration clampdown, trade war and pummeling of our traditional allies is part of that too. It's not like he kept these things a secret when he was running.\n\nBut Trump's tunnel vision has led him to the lowest low points of his presidency, including this week.\n\nTrump's expressions of moral equivalency between the United States and Russia, feverish conspiracy theorizing and attacks against his fellow Americans on stage with Vladimir Putin must have sounded pitiful to most.\n\nThe country has become inured to Trump's rhetorical excesses. The constant outrage with which Trump's outrageous statements were met during the 2016 campaign and at the beginning of his presidency was simply unsustainable, so folks both for him and against him started tuning Trump out.\n\nBut in the moment where the words of a president arguably matter most, Trump's comments struck home even among those who had become numb to his shock-jock routine.\n\nPresumably, Trump felt free to speak from the heart in Helsinki because what he said reflects the views of some of his most stalwart supporters. It's certainly not a majority of the country, and it may not even be a majority of Republicans, but among a substantial number of Trump voters, the idea that Hillary Clinton is worse than Putin is completely obvious.\n\nAs we have said many times before, there's a chunk of the electorate that wouldn't even care if Trump had colluded with Putin. And if all that happened was that Putin helped Trump win the election, to these folks that says only good things about the Russian strongman. When Putin smirked to Chris Wallace that what was in the emails his agents stole was true and therefore appropriate to release, he was echoing a Trump campaign talking point.\n\nThose same political hatreds well nurtured by the divisive politics of our time have put us in a point where at least a quarter of Republicans think Putin is an alright guy, according to polls. They no doubt see his interference in the election as a good thing since it was, in their minds, for the correct side.\n\nOur rotten politics has infected seemingly everything in American life, and that goes for our foreign policy too. Yes, there were American left-wingers who preferred the Soviet Union to the GOP, but vanishingly few would have ever felt comfortable saying so. Now, it's acceptable among some ring-wing sects to pick the Kremlin over the Democrats.\n\nWhat Trump discovered, though, is that his base is not as big as he thinks it is. The painful walk back you watched Tuesday, much like the one he tried to execute last summer in the face of another base maintenance debacle concerning the white nationalists in Charlottesville, reflected that realization.\n\nWhat some Republicans like about Trump - the things you saw in Finland - most Republicans only tolerate for the sake of obtaining their preferred policy outcomes. And Monday was too much for the normies.\n\nBut what got Trump to the point that he felt free to speak so freely in front of Putin is the fact that in our sliced and diced electorate, the passionate support of a chunk of the electorate is more valuable than having broad support.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: AIR SUPPLY\n\n\"But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.\" - James Madison, Federalist No. 10\n\nTIME OUT: ALMOST HEAVEN... ON A BUN\n\nHappy National Hot Dog Day, dear readers. While we strenuously object to the proliferation of fake holidays, we will not pass up this excuse to tell America the truth about frankfurters. We know that from Coney Island to Chicago to Chavez Ravine there are many local favorites for what constitutes hot dog bliss. But we think it's time to tell you the truth: West Virginia hot dogs are the best. To make the ideal West Virginia hot dog, start with not a jumbo beef frank, but a humble weenie with a little snap to its casing and a light spice in its filling. Cook it on a griddle and nestle it in a pillowy soft bun. Apply yellow mustard, raw white onion chopped finer than baby's breath and then the sauce. It would be wrong to call it \"chili\" since it has no beans or even tomatoes. Truth be told, it is just finely ground hamburger cooked with ample chili spices - not too spicy, not too sweet. Now, for those of you who like sauerkraut on your hot dogs, make sure you're sitting down when you read this: Top it all with a layer of cool, creamy, crunchy and sweet coleslaw. There are still a few joints serving these up the right way in West Virginia, but you can easily make them at home.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein went to Trump last week and offered him the choice: before or after the Putin summit on Monday in Helsinki? Trump chose before, ultimately putting the issue into the spotlight just 72 hours before the high-stakes meeting, the people said. In the end, Trump faced a torrent of bipartisan criticism for suggesting he was leaning toward accepting the Russian president's denial that his government was behind hacking during the 2016 presidential election, even though Trump had hoped the indictment of 12 Russians on charges of meddling would give him the upper hand, one of the people said.\"\n\nAccording to Trump Russia will 'help' with NoKo - Reuters: \"President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia would help with North Korea and offered an enthusiastic update on the U.S. process of negotiating with the antagonistic Asian nation over nuclear weapons. 'Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along,' said Trump on Twitter. 'There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!' At the same time the tweet was published the RIA news agency reported that a summit between the leaders of Russia and North Korea is 'on the agenda.'\"\n\nPompeo to testify before Senate on summit - The Hill: \"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week, where he's expected to face a grilling over the summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump.

His testimony will come a week after Trump sparked intense, bipartisan backlash in Washington when he appeared next to Putin at a joint press conference in Helsinki, Finland, and denied that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nROBY ROLLS TO VICTORY DESPITE PAST TRUMP CRITICISM\n\nMontgomery Advertiser: \"Despite a five-candidate primary which forced her into a runoff, Rep.

Paul Gosar, a conservative Republican from northwestern Arizona, broke from traditional norms and endorsed former state legislator Kelli Ward for the U.S. Senate over his colleague Rep. Martha McSally. In a statement announcing the endorsement, Gosar questioned McSally's conservative Republican credentials, a public broadside to the conservative image she has been peddling to primary voters as she seeks the GOP nomination for Arizona's open Senate seat. 'We cannot afford another establishment patsy who promises one thing and votes differently,' Gosar's statement said. 'Arizona has suffered for years with a lackluster senate delegation that promised one thing during the election and did another back in D.C. -- Kelli is not like that. Her opponent, Martha McSally, is. In my time working with Martha, I found her, though likable personally, to be very inconsistent politically.'\"\n\nHouse Republicans falling behind in midterm fundraising - Politico: \"An unusually large number of House Republican incumbents were outraised by their Democratic opponents in the past three months, more stark evidence of GOP candidates' money woes, which continue to expand the number of seats susceptible to Democratic takeover. Democrats in 56 House districts surpassed Republican incumbents in second-quarter fundraising, according to a POLITICO analysis of the latest Federal Election Commission filings. Sixteen of those House Republicans finished the quarter with less cash in their campaign accounts than Democratic opponents, while no Democratic members lag their Republican challengers in cash. It's a financial trend line that has gotten worse for Republican candidates over the past year, even as megadonors pour millions into the House GOP super PAC -- a reflection of Democratic intensity that has coursed through the party's donors and voters since President Donald Trump's election.\"\n\nCuomo donor gave enough times to drive down average donation amount -WashTimes: \"Always be a man of the people; especially if you can game the system to look like one. At least since Sen. Bernard Sanders turned it into a talking point that the average donation to his 2016 presidential campaign was $27, politicians have touted a small figure as proof they run a grassroots campaign and aren't the product of a few big donors. According to a report Tuesday in The New York Times, the campaign of Gov. Andrew Cuomo took it to a new level, taking absurdly small amounts of money from people to make the average donation size smaller. Some of those donors were dedicated though. The Times reported that in the run-up to the reporting deadline, donor Christopher Kim contributed 69 times.

Planned Parenthood spent just over $188,000 on Facebook ads over the same period. The ads bought by Mr. Trump and his PAC were also seen the most by Facebook's users, having been viewed by at least 37 million people since May. That compared with 24 million people who saw the second-most viewed group of political ads, which were also from Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nHouse passes ice resolution - Roll Call\n\nHouse looks to match Trump's border wall request - WaPo\n\nCalif.

Had the Democratic nominee in 2020 been, say, Tim Kaine or some other moderate-sounding, ethical person with the requisite experience there are millions of Republicans who might not have voted for Trump. Some would have voted for the Dem, but many others would have felt better about the idea of a protest candidate. The peril that Clinton represented in the eyes of many conservatives was real, and her own ethical quagmires were rank enough to deny the Blue Team the opportunity to really hit Trump where it hurts. Joe Biden likes to say, \"Don't judge me by the Almighty. Judge me by the alternative.\" And for all of the remarkable and unsettling things about the 2016 election, one part remains inescapable: Democrats chose their worst nominee in a couple of generations. I'm quite certain that Trump stands a very good chance at getting re-elected despite this most recent meltdown. This is, after all, the same guy who equivocated over the murder of a protestor by a white nationalist and still can claim the support of about four in 10 voters. One of the main reasons Trump stands such a good chance at re-election is that Democrats right now do not look like a party inclined toward moderate outreach toward persuadable voters. It's doubtful Trump could get as lucky as he was in 2016 with a candidate like Clinton, but never say never.]\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nSMELLS LIKE SCHNITZEL\n\nLondon Telegraph: \"Staff handed out free deodorants to passengers on Vienna's notoriously stuffy U6 [subway] line this week, and it appears the initiative was popular: the entire stock of 14,000 deodorant sprays was grabbed in a single day, and plans for a second distribution have had to be shelved. The deodorants were 'torn out of our hands,' Daniel Amman, a spokesman for the Wiener Linien public transport company said.

Brianna McClelland contributed to this report. Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.", "Could a model of AI-based surveillance actually be a force for good?\n\nChina is taking the lead in drawing on recent technological developments to vastly enhance its capacities to keep its people under surveillance. In particular, it is deploying facial-recognition technology in places such as banks, hotels, stadiums, airports -- and numerous street corners. The number of surveillance cameras in China, estimated at 200 million, is four times greater than the number of such cameras in the United States, according to a New York Times report. (However, given that China has four times more people than the U.S. the ratio per capita -- the more appropriate measurement -- is the same.)\n\nThe main violation of privacy is not that this technology is scanning faces of people not suspected of having committed any offense -- they are in public spaces and even in democracies, \"scanning\" by the police, looking for suspects on the wanted list as well as others, is quite common. Rather, the main privacy-violating feature of the Chinese system is that it compares the faces that are scanned to those found in a database that includes the pictures of many millions of Chinese citizens -- whether or not they committed a crime, or were merely arrested.\n\nUntil recently, privacy advocates could console themselves some by noting that facial-recognition technology was unreliable. It used to generate many false positives (misidentifying people as criminals or suspects) and false negatives (not catching offenders). It especially had difficulties in distinguishing people of dark pigmentation from each other. However, recent improvements in facial-recognition technology and advances in AI have made it much more reliable. Indeed, reports show that Chinese authorities have successfully used it to catch criminals mixed in a mass crowd at concerts, train stations, and at street intersections. Jaywalking (a source of traffic fatalities) is reported to have been significantly reduced, and in at least one instance, the New York Times reports, bicycle theft was eliminated at a building complex.\n\nChina is moving to integrate information from facial-recognition cameras with input from other surveillance technologies, further enhancing its capacity to surveil its people. Its \"Sharp Eyes\" project intends \"to connect the security cameras that already scan roads, shopping malls and transport hubs with private cameras on compounds and buildings, and integrate them into one nationwide surveillance and data-sharing platform,\" writes Simon Denyer in the Washington Post. He adds \"At the back end, these efforts merge with a vast database of information on every citizen, a 'Police Cloud' that aims to scoop up such data as criminal and medical records, travel bookings, online purchase and even social media comments -- and link it to everyone's identity card and face.\"\n\nThe first lesson one draws from these new technological developments is that the notion that the internet will provide a way to bring down tyranny needs to be updated, if not turned on its head. Much was made during the Arab Spring of the use of the internet by those who rose against their government. (Some reports later concluded that the role of the internet in these uprisings was overstated.) Regardless, now that one clearly sees that the internet can be used, at least as readily, to enhance massive surveillance, one must accept that it is far from the libertarian utopia its champions assumed it to be.\n\nThe second lesson is that totalitarian regimes are developing highly effective tools that allow them to oppress their people and stay in power with relatively little bloodshed. I am not saying that people in China are not jailed for political offenses, or simply disappear. However, at least for now, the authorities seem to have found ways to keep the lid on it without resorting to the kind of actions China took when it sent tanks to Tiananmen Square, and at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of protesters were shot in cold blood along the way. High tech totalitarian governments seem to be at least somewhat less heavy-handed and hence more able to maintain control.\n\nOne can be less alarmed by, and even find some value in, a new usage of facial-recognition technology by the Chinese authorities, namely for shaming. The New York Times reports that cameras with facial-recognition technology were installed at a busy intersection where jaywalking is a common occurrence. On a large outdoor screen, the photos, names, and government ID numbers of those caught jaywalking are displayed in an effort to publicly shame offenders. The result was a decrease in jaywalking at that intersection.\n\nMany libertarians and liberals find shaming a very shameful way of keeping public order. However, this is the way social order has long worked in small communities. Most people, most of the time, \"behaved\" because their behavior was visible and their identity was known. When people moved into cities, they became anonymous and crime exploded, leading to high levels of incarceration. To the extent that one can now identify people in cities -- as the Chinese data suggests -- public order will be improved. Note that shaming is essentially democratic because if people do not believe the behavior highlighted is inappropriate, no shaming follows.\n\nI realize, of course, that China is using this new technology to oppress people. But the fault is in the particular way this technology is being used rather than being inherent in it. Examples from China demonstrate that facial-recognition technology, and shaming -- if used for proper purposes -- can help save many lives and curb crime.\n\nAmitai Etzioni is a University Professor and Professor of International Relations at The George Washington University. He is the author of Foreign Policy: Thinking Outside the Box. A short film summarizes his International Relations work.", "While the whole of America seems to be blathering on about Colin Kaepernick's contempt of the American flag, the Ninth Circuit Court handed down a ruling last week about another man who took a knee. It makes me happy to hear so many voices raised for First Amendment rights, and makes me hopeful that Joseph Kennedy's rights will eventually be respected.\n\nHis is a story less well known. First hired as an assistant football coach of Bremerton High School in Washington in 2008, Kennedy was reportedly leading their coaches and players in prayer even before he was hired. These were voluntary prayers, in the tradition of Bremerton High, both before and after games.\n\nFrom the beginning of his tenure as coach, he also had the custom of kneeling, alone, on the 50-yard line after each game and offering a prayer of thanksgiving to his God. Several games into his first season, he was approached by some players asking if they could join him. He replied, \"This is a free country.\"\n\nThat was 2008. Things are changing.\n\nAfter seven continuous years of leading these prayers, an employee of another school complained to the Bremerton administrator. This single complaint from someone completely outside of the Bremerton community immediately led Coach Kennedy to voluntarily cease all communal prayers, both in the locker room and on the field.\n\nPause here to notice that the Kaepernick controversy was caused by a sudden change on his part after a 13-year career (prep, college, and pro) of standing for the National Anthem. By contrast, Kennedy's troubles were not brought on by a change in his actions but by a solitary complaint after seven years of consistently accepted activity.\n\nThis is the first thing to notice in today's First Amendment wars. There is a gargantuan bias toward novelty and against long-established traditions. The practice of locker room prayers not only had a seven-year tradition under coach Kennedy but also predated his hiring. On the other hand, Kaepernick flouted a tradition of standing for the National Anthem before a football game which dates back over 70 years, even before the merger that created the modern NFL.\n\nRepeatedly, we see this bias at work. Novelties like same-sex marriage become the newest sacred cows, while decades-long traditions are tossed away like yesterday's underwear. This is evidence not of open-mindedness but of revolutionary fever.\n\nTraditions connect us with our past and serve as time-tested vehicles to inculcate community values. Revolutionaries hate traditions precisely because they work. Revolutionary cries for tolerance and open-mindedness are generally preludes to the most intolerant and closed-minded actions.\n\nA second interesting aspect of the Coach Kennedy case is the response of the school district to the publicizing of the controversy. At first, Coach Kennedy was able to keep the last vestige of his private prayer under the radar. He simply waited until most people left the field before praying.\n\nBut then he wrote a letter formally asking for a religious accommodation under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He thought this would formalize the compromise, allowing him to continue privately saying post-game prayer on the 50-yard line. But this simple letter made the very act of kneeling become a public scandal.\n\nIn free societies, formal accommodations for religion can meet everyone's needs. But in totalitarian societies, there are no such things as formal exemptions; only temporary and informal non-enforcement can preserve the new public religion. Counter-revolutionary practices, once visible, must be ruthlessly put down.\n\nFor the Bremerton School District, Kennedy's public letter was seen as a hostile act. It required a new and sterner edict. For seven years, fans had watched some of the players and coaches gather around coach Kennedy on the 50-yard line. They were no strangers to the practice. What did the Bremerton administration expect would happen when that practice was suddenly banned?\n\nDid they think the fans wouldn't notice, or wouldn't care? Did they expect Coach Kennedy to end that practice overnight without saying a word to the players, coaches and fans who had grown accustomed to it? This is a third problem with revolutionaries. They never seem to anticipate the natural consequences of their revolutionary edicts.\n\nCoach Kennedy tried to be proactive. He informed the school board, the players and the coaches that he was no longer allowed to pray corporately with them but that he would still pray privately. This seemed the most sensible thing to say since the school board banned him from signaling when he was about to pray but insisted that he was \"free to engage in religious activity, including prayer, so long as it does not interfere with job responsibilities.\"\n\nBut teams and communities have their own ideas as well. The Bremerton school board had forgotten that in a truly free and voluntary community, you cannot coerce one citizen without coercing them all.\n\nTo forbid a man from group-praying means also to forbid others from grouping around him for prayer. In other words, not only did they forbid free speech to Kennedy, they simultaneously forbode free association to the coaches and players, students and parents who wanted to join him.\n\nThis does not sit well with free people. Nor did the fans, coaches and players take this news sitting down. So, while the district could not forbid others from joining him, they nevertheless held Kennedy personally responsible for anyone who did. This set the stage for the next escalation.\n\nAs players and fans talked openly about watching his actions and joining him as soon as he knelt to pray, the district enforcers worried that they didn't have the power to stop them. In time, they made yet another new edict. For the first time in the history of Bremerton football, parents and fans would be forbidden from coming onto the field after a game. Of course, new rules require new enforcers. \"Ultimately, the district made arrangements with the Bremerton Police Department to secure the field after games.\"\n\nBut before this new rule could be passed and enforced, people simply watched and prayed. At the close of the game following his request for religious accommodation, when the district failed to answer Kennedy's request, Kennedy shook hands with the opposing players, waited until most of the Bremerton players were otherwise engaged and dropped to a knee to pray.\n\nWhile he was silently praying, \"coaches and players from the opposing team, as well as members of the general public and media, spontaneously joined [him] on the field and knelt beside him.\" Worse, pictures of this event were taken and published in various media. This was too much for the Bremerton school district.\n\nInstead of blaming themselves for escalating the situation by edict after edict, they blamed coach Kennedy for engaging \"in religious exercise ... under the game lights, in BHS-logoed attire.\" In only 36 days, the mere act of kneeling on the 50-yard line had gone from a long-standing custom to behavior that may \"be perceived as district endorsement [of a religion].\"\n\nSeriously. That's what they said in a court of law, and that's what the Ninth Circuit Court affirmed in denying coach Kennedy his First Amendment rights. (All quotations in this article are from their Aug. 23 ruling.)\n\nExcuse me, but I can guarantee you nobody on the field that night believed they were engaging in some \"district-endorsed\" activity. Rather, it is quite clear that everyone who joined coach Kennedy in prayer was knowingly thumbing their nose in contempt at the overreaching Bremerton School District.\n\nNext time you hear \"the land of the free and the home of the brave,\" it would be a good idea to take a knee and pray that Bremerton's overreaching is overruled. If it's not, we may soon see the day when no public employee will be permitted to take a knee in prayer.", "An Italian bishop has threatened legal action against Pokemon Go, saying the 'diabolical' game has turned its army of smartphone-wielding players into 'walking dead', reports said on Thursday.\n\nAntonio Stagliano, the bishop of the southern town of Noto in Sicily, was quoted by several newspapers as saying he was ready to go to court to get the wildly popular app banned.\n\nThe augmented-reality game, which allows players to catch virtual monsters using GPS mapping on their phones, has become a global craze since its launch on July 6 but has also prompted a wave of criticism and controversy.\n\nAn Italian bishop has threatened legal action against Pokemon Go, saying the 'diabolical' game has turned its army of smartphone-wielding players into 'walking dead'\n\nStagliano had already lashed out at the game in recent days, declaring it 'a totalitarian system close to Nazism' and saying it had 'alienated thousands and thousands of young people' by getting them hooked on monster-hunting.\n\nThe bishop is well known in the Italian press, particularly for his mid-mass renditions of rock hits by popular singers Noemi and Marco Mengoni.\n\nHis outburst follows a French mayor denouncing the 'anarchical settlement' of 'Pokemon Go' characters on the 'territory' of his eastern village and ordering the game's creator to remove the virtual creatures.\n\nThe augmented-reality game, which allows players to catch virtual monsters using GPS mapping on their phones, has become a global craze since its launch on July 6\n\nBressolles Mayor Fabrice Beauvois said on Tuesday that he has mailed a decree to California-based Niantic Inc. and The Pokemon Company to make sure they stop setting up Pokemons in the village of about 800 inhabitants northeast of Lyon.\n\nIn his decree, the mayor says the search for Pokemons puts pedestrians and drivers at risk because players get inattentive while watching their smartphones and that it may also result in groups of people forming at night.\n\nBeauvois insisted in a phone interview with The Associated Press that his order, issued last week, is only targeting the two companies, not the players. He said that Bressolles is the first French municipality to issue such a decree.\n\nThe mayor lamented the settlement of Pokemon characters on the 'territory' of his village without Niantic asking for prior authorization.\n\n'When a cafe or a restaurant owner wants to open a business in any French town, they have an obligation to request prior authorization to the mayor. The rule applies to all people wishing to set up an activity or occupy a space on a public property. So it applies to Niantic as well, even though their settlement is virtual,' Beauvois said.\n\nBeauvois maintains the 'Pokemon Go' phenomenon is spreading in a 'contagious' way, that the game may lead to a 'dangerous addiction' among young people and that it is his responsibility to ensure public tranquility and order.\n\n'They (Niantic developers) use the entire planet as a playground,' he said.", "Steve Bannon, former top advisor to Donald Trump, said Wednesday that the U.S. has been embroiled in a trade conflict with China for decades.\n\n\"We're at war with China,\" Bannon said, praising Trump for taking on the Chinese. \"We're winning.\"\n\nBannon was speaking at CNBC's Delivering Alpha event Wednesday.\n\nHis appearance comes on the heels of a provocative statement he gave to CNBC on Tuesday in which he said Trump knows he needs to \"unite the West against the rise of a totalitarian China.\"\n\nFor Bannon, the war against China can only end in one way and that's with the U.S. as victors.\n\n\"How it ends is in victory. Victory is when they give all full access to their markets,\" he said.\n\nBannon's says his message is still heard within the White House. He told CNBC he is in contact with administration officials and implied that he speaks with the president through lawyers.\n\nBannon's resurgence comes after nearly a year after he was forced out of the White House.\n\nDuring his tenure at the White House, Bannon was in charge of advising the president on how to best implement his nationalist agenda that appealed to the base of the Republican Party during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMany of those proposed policies have become part of the administration's policies, including clamping down on illegal immigration, implementing tariffs on China and allies of the United States, and improving relationships with adversaries such as Russia.\n\nHowever, many within the admonition, including Trump's son in law Jared Kushner along with National Economic Council director Gary Cohn privately spoke out against Bannon and his bombastic methods of hurting his enemies through leaking stories to the press.\n\nAfter butting heads with one too many White House officials, including, at times, Trump himself, Bannon left the administration in August and went back to the conservative news outlet of Breitbart to resume his duties as executive chairman.\n\nHowever, tensions between Bannon and the commander in chief took a turn for the worse in January, when author Michael Wolff published his White House tell-all, \"Fire and Fury.\" In the book, Bannon called a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a group of Russians \"treasonous\" and \"unpatriotic.\" He also claimed that investigators were \"going to crack Don Jr. like an egg on national TV.\"\n\nThat was enough to get him pushed out at Breitbart, as one of its key financial supporters and an ally of Trump, Rebekah Mercer, turned on Bannon.\n\nHer father, billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, also distanced himself from Bannon before the Wolff book was published.\n\nYet, even in his time gone from the Trump administration, Bannon has continued to push his populist and nationalist ideologies.\n\nHe recently toured Europe and met with candidates running for political office, including Italian populists who won the March elections and formed a coalition government in late May. Recently, Bannon has been trying to help the president and the GOP through his own political operation.\n\nSince May, Bannon has been paying his surrogates to produce political ads in cities across the United States, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe campaign will tout the Trump administration's accomplishments that dovetail with Bannon's own America first views, including passing a comprehensive tax reform bill and working with Congress to curtail the Dodd-Frank Act's impact on community banks, people said.\n\nThe ads will argue that Trump needs Republicans to control the House and the Senate in order for him to continue to pursue his agenda, the people added. The ads will not endorse specific candidates but rather the need for Republicans to maintain control of both chambers.\n\nAs part of Bannon's plan, dubbed \"top secret\" by one of his allies, he's also looking to create a war room, a person with knowledge of the matter said, that will allow him to monitor contests through the November election.\n\nIt is unclear where Bannon is getting the financing.

And along with it come the reactionary and revanchist fever-dreams of those who would return us to some dimly-perceived past glory, when acquiescence was the order of the day, and a man surely knew his place - or perhaps more to the point, a woman.\n\nAnd so, putting aside those 'events and personalities' which do not seek to control our lives, how then shall we seek to govern ourselves amidst all this ugly turmoil we see around us? - Erdogan in Turkey, Putin in Russia, Trump in the U.S., Xi in China, Kim in North Korea, Assad in Syria - shameless liars and dissemblers of the rule of law. Whether or not they are voted into power or merely assume it as dynastic inheritors, the result is the same - the progressive disenfranchisement and disempowerment of the people. There are some clues and indicators beyond the obvious, however. So, it is well to understand the reality that surrounds us at each particular juncture.\n\nThere are several recognized forms whereby human societies form government - or, at least, systems of power and control. They are as follows: -\n\nAutocracy - the rule of a single individual - aka dictatorship\n\nOligarchy - the rule of the few\n\nPlutocracy - the rule of the rich\n\nTotalitarianism - the rule of the State\n\nOchlocracy - the rule of the mob\n\nTheocracy - the rule of a god through a priesthood\n\nKleptocracy - the rule of the thieves\n\nDemocracy - the rule of the people\n\nAnarchy - the absence of rulers or a state\n\nThere are variants such as the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' and 'anarcho-syndicalism' and 'libertarianism' and various other -isms and hybrids, but the above list pretty much covers the conventions. I think it is therefore not difficult to zero in on the appropriate moniker for the current format of rule, in the industrialized western world at least. It is made apparent in the electoral uprisings in democratic countries referred to as populism - both of the right and the left. It is also well-documented over the last number of years in the news-play given to the 1%, and the vast and growing disparity in wealth between the miniscule top tiers of society and the roiling masses down below who are falling ever farther behind, even as their pockets are further picked by the ultra-rich. Yes, by any reasonable set of indicators we are living under a plutocracy - the rule of the rich, where the rich make the rules, and where the deliberate and sequential disempowerment of what the ancient Greeks referred to as the Demos - the personification of the people - is wrought on every front.\n\nNow, the rich, and especially the ultra-rich, tend to be persons of remarkably low productivity. Their main trick is having learned how to amass capital. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump and David Koch have not improved the lives of humanity one whit. What they have done, however, is to position themselves squarely in the cash-stream of working people to such extent as to divert unimaginably large chunks of those folks' sweat-equity into their quenchless pockets. The financial crisis of 2008-2009, it should be recalled, was nothing more than the remorseless fleecing of millions and millions of hapless schmucks who took the bait and signed on to their own undoing - sub-prime mortgages, junk bonds, ponzi schemes, gutted retirement funds. It was a massacre. And then the victims were forced to pay for their own victimhood through their hard-earned tax dollars, as the perpetrators went scot-free, laughing all the way to the bank, even as those same banks were being bailed out by the government funded by those same aforementioned tax dollars. Indeed, the last white-collar train-robber to see any jail time was dopey old Bernie Madoff - and that was well before the whole Lehman Brothers debacle. Wall Street just put on a blank expression and grinned goofily - \"Who? - us?\" - and sniggered into their martinis. As was quipped at the time - capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down. Which is to say that while the earning is fat - all hail capital enterprise. But when the cash-cow is suddenly gutted - out come the begging bowls in the halls of opulence and power, crying to the very government that let them get away with it all in the first place. What's wrong with this picture?\n\nNone of the above-mentioned 'entrepreneurs' invented a cure for cancer, or provided any succour for hungry children. They produced not one widget or thing of any recognizable use, and here I include a string of tawdry hotels. What they did - are doing - is pander to the most vulnerable elements of gullibility and crass consumerism. Their unearned wealth represents, as Adam Smith would have had it - 'the income of men who love to reap where they have not sowed.' They are swine. And they run the show. Capitalism itself is, of course, a somewhat bedraggled mechanism these days. The so-called rising tide of prosperity was meant to 'lift all boats'. But recalling the observation by the American essayist Edward Abbey that 'growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell', it might fairly be said that we are in need of some fresh idea. The luxury super-yachts have left the dock quite some time ago and the tide is well on the ebb. The rest of us are left standing along the pier wanly waving our tattered hankies.\n\nFor a start, then, it would be well to remember this aphorism from the Canadian political philosopher Frank H. Underhill - \"The basic principle regulating production, distribution and service must be the common good rather than private profit.\" Indeed. It must be noted, of course, that there are thoughtful and well-intentioned proponents of capitalism as an economic system. It has its defensible merits, and no better tool has yet been devised for the sheer ability to create employment. But at what cost? It has long been bitterly realized that capital has a pernicious tendency to accumulate at the top, much to the chagrin of those who would tout its supremacy as a social panacea. And it is to the deep embarrassment of such persons that the current situation of egregious wealth disparity belies capitalism's ability to funnel greed to the betterment of all. More's the pity, given our servitude to its precepts.\n\nWhat are we to do, then? Well, whatever it is we better get at it. For I have a dystopian vision of impending hell to lay out. And it has already begun. We might start by stopping our starry-eyed admiration for the rich. They don't deserve it. They are one-trick ponies who have a whole bunch of money and stuff and power exactly because a lot of other people don't have that money and stuff and power - it's all been appropriated and tied up at the fat end of society. A good hockey player, or a hard-working farmer, or a single Mom who toughs it out for her kids are worthy of unqualified admiration - a billionaire is not. The super-rich are a drag on society and represent a bloat that gibbles the social contract. And they work assiduously, tacitly or otherwise, to see to it that legislation concurrent with their needs is accordingly engendered. Increasingly too, they like to see their own in the governmental halls of power. Even noblesse oblige, wherein the rich felt morally obliged to share somewhat with those 'less fortunate', has gone by the boards. Trickle-down economics has now morphed into trickle-up voodoo, and there is no limit to how deep these parasites will plumb the depths of the pockets of an already struggling populace.\n\nHere's the dystopian part. These folks love robots - all kinds of robots - robot servants, robot clerks, robot cars, robot factory workers, robot cops, robot teachers, robot slaves, robot soldiers! They envision a world where troublesome human workers with their expectations of wellness and fair wages and decent working conditions and affordable health care and proffered education for their children and representational governance and meaningful employment and a lack of duplicity and a humane and responsive social fabric all become fanciful things of the past. Let the robots do it all and to hell with all the blue-collar whiners. Even the likes of Elon Musk, my personal favourite billionaire entrepreneur who otherwise celebrates the human condition and pursues products to mitigate climate change (well, rocket ships is another matter), has built his giga-factory in the Nevada desert to produce lithium-ion batteries for his electric cars to operate almost entirely without human input - all robotic. That's how things get done these days. Facebook has a pathetic payroll as compared to its capital valuation - a gaggle of Millennials perched in front of computer screens quaffing kale smoothies and munching on quinoa muffins, but otherwise just algorithms and a deep artificial intelligence running the shop. Not much opportunity for labour action here. And there is the point. The 'masses' are an inconvenience and the sooner they are dispensed with the better it will all be. The best we might expect from these new overlords is a form of perverse socialism whereby the extraneous common folk are given a basic income, lots of drugs, and an endless parade of escapist trash entertainment designed to make them forget their utter irrelevance - oh, and remove any notion in their addled heads of challenging authority or seeking to speak truth to power.\n\nGetting back to Mr. Marx, then - his articulation of the dynamic balance between labour and capital was accurate in his day. So was his suggestion that capital has a tendency to accumulate upwards and that the essential societal struggle was between classes, between those of privilege and those who toiled. And yet, how could he have anticipated the current mish-mash of reality? The struggle has become essentially classless, even as the labour force itself is hollowed out from within by automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and rampant factory closures. And the watchers are everywhere. Hey - do a jaywalk in any big city in China these days and you get tagged by a facial-recognition camera and the fine is extracted from your bank account. If it is deemed a criminal violation you get scooped by the coppers. Nice, huh? Ditto for any public gathering - drones fly in and tag your faces. 'Bad' people disappear. This is the ultimate and happy dream realm of the plutocracy. The rich simply don't want anybody telling them they can't be rich. So they make a world where everybody behaves - or else. Check it out - it's already forming around us. George Orwell's appalling dystopian hell pales in comparison. But he had the essentials otherwise dialled in pretty good.\n\nAh, but cheer up. There is actually brightness all around if you stop to look. The zombies and automatons have by no means yet won the day. Smart, incisive and highly inspirited people are rising to the challenge of the times and rattling the cages of the squalid plutocrats who would govern us. And these hyper-wealthy vermin fear two forms of social manifestation more than any other - the people, and the mob. The mob (not the mafia kind) is, of course, a useless tool of social evolution, having, as it does, no brain - just torches and pitchforks, etc. All it can do is destroy. The People on the other hand - the Demos - is quite another thing. For the People can achieve personification on the highest moral grounds when so moved to do so. And representational governance, the rule of the People, aka democracy, is the finest idea yet made manifest for the moulding of the common good. It is therefore the highest desire of the plutocracy to discredit the democratic process and convince the people that voting is worthless. We call this voter disenfranchisement, and it has many forms both active and passive - all of them dangerous and insidious.\n\nLet us therefore recognize and celebrate the warriors who would scale the ramparts on our behalf. Alexei Navalny in Russia risks life and livelihood to challenge the kleptocracy of Vladimir Putin, the stolid and decent Angela Merkel in Germany stands as a bulwark against populist demagoguery so keenly deployed by shadowy oligarchic forces, Alexandria Ocacio-Cortez emerges from the ranks of the Democratic Party in New York City to unseat a corporate-sponsored hack, Gisela Mota, the first female mayor of Temixco, Mexico who went up against the money and guns of the drug cartels and paid with her life, Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman and former sex-slave under the violent, shambling caliphate of Islamic State who speaks out against the totalitarian impulses of religion run amok, any and all of the women of Iran and Saudi Arabia who struggle against the bloated theocracy which seeks to dehumanize them, that guy with the shopping bag who stood in front of the tanks outside Tiananmen Square, and last but by no means least, our own Rachel Notley here in Alberta who sees the power of concentrated wealth for what it is and strives to undo a decades-long toxic legacy of corporate larceny and compliant government that stood by and watched as the coffers of the people of the province were systematically drained and spirited away by trans-national snake-oil merchants.\n\nTheirs is vital work - and sometimes, yes - lethally dangerous. It takes effort. The status quo grinds away at us like some persistent stomach-ache that just won't go away. The rich self-perceive as being deserving of their wealth, just as they in turn perceive the poor to be deserving of their poverty. And so this noxious gaggle of plutocrats gather in to themselves ever more of the booty of the land, ever more of the birthright of all peoples. They are close to being out of control - but not quite. We may yet reign them in through the applied use of our rights and freedoms and the heritage of those who have laid out for us the pathways to justice, fairness and equality. But it means engagement - and it means believing in the better tomorrow. This is mindfulness - and our minds they have not yet entirely usurped. The next time an election comes around, take the time to ask prospective candidates just how they plan to reinstate our birthright and return what is ours from the swollen vaults of the few. Don't shy away from such questions, and don't accept glib answers either. Things are out of whack. There is still time to make fixes. In this country we still have the rule of law and a vigorous, if somewhat faded, democracy. The tools are there for us to use - if only we will so choose. They rain down lies upon us and hope to stymie us into a state of stupefaction. How else do you think it worked for Trump? - and now he is the most powerful man in the world. It's well past time to wake up and smell the coffee.\n\nOne more thing about Karl Marx - \"What I do know,\" he said, \"is that I am not a Marxist.\" Intriguing. Go figger. But then, when you think about it, Jesus Christ wasn't a Christian either. So what's in a name? There is work to be done.\n\nPhil Burpee\n\nJuly, 2018", "The University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia is a long and spiraling network of old buildings, crosswalks, and pedestrian bridges linking the Penn Library (where one may examine the papers of essayist Agnes Repplier) and the Kelly Writers House (where Susan Sontag once described the public reaction to her New Yorker essay on the September 11th attack in New York City). In the 1970s, the Penn campus was a major hangout of Ira Einhorn, founder of Earth Day and touted as a Philadelphia notable by city politicians until he was arrested for murdering and stuffing the body of his girlfriend, Holly Maddux, inside a trunk in his Powelton Village apartment.\n\nOutwardly, the Penn campus is a pretty quiet place, although in 2017 the student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, reported that neo-Nazi posters were appearing on campus with messages like \"Stop the blacks,\" and \"join your local Nazis.\" While Penn has a policy that \"no poster shall be prohibited or restricted solely on basis of content,\" enough students were riled up to attract the attention of local media. Although the offending posters mysteriously disappeared shortly after their discovery, student activists covered the \"LOVE\" sculpture near City Hall with hundreds of anti-Nazi posters warning \"We are ready to resist.\"\n\nBut resist what? Neo-Nazi sympathizers in the City of Philadelphia are about as numerous as sub-groups of transgender Mennonites. If there are any neo-Nazis here, they are quiet basement dwellers who rarely make public appearances. The zero-to-none neo-Nazi activity in Philadelphia suggests that the \"Nazi\" posters were put up by leftists so that they would have something to protest against. False flag operations are common on the Left, since it is the Left that pushes for fascist, totalitarian interdiction of freedom of speech.\n\nThe Left, of course, also likes to espouse its calumny anonymously, because it is not interested in freedom or justice but rather seeks to control lives by government-enforced restrictions on freedom.\n\nTo understand all things Penn, one must look into the phenomenon of the \"Penn Face.\" In April of this year, CBS Philly produced a report on suicide on the Penn campus focused mainly on the death of Penn undergrad Olivia Kong, who climbed onto the tracks at 40th Street in front of an oncoming train. Prior to Kong's death, 14 Penn students lost their lives at their own hands since 2013. The attorney for Kong's family -- Kong's family believes that the university could have done something to save their troubled daughter's life -- said that Kong's problems and personal issues were all hidden behind the \"Penn Face.\"\n\n\"There seems to be something unique about Penn that it is not only a pressure cooker, but there's this culture where the students are almost not permitted to show any vulnerability,\" Nelson Shepherd, the Kong family attorney, told the press.", "Is THIS a warning? In the past few days I have begun to sense a dangerous and dark new intolerance in the air, which I have never experienced before. An unbidden instinct tells me to be careful what I say or write, in case it ends badly for me. How badly? That is the trouble. I am genuinely unsure.\n\nI have been to many countries where free speech is dangerous. But I have always assumed that there was no real risk here.\n\nNow, several nasty trends have come together. The treatment of Jeremy Corbyn, both by politicians and many in the media, for doing what he is paid for and leading the Opposition, seems to me to be downright shocking.\n\nNow, several nasty trends have come together. The treatment of Jeremy Corbyn, both by politicians and many in the media, for doing what he is paid for and leading the Opposition, seems to me to be downright shocking\n\nI disagree with Mr Corbyn about many things and actively loathe the way he has sucked up to Sinn Fein. But he has a better record on foreign policy than almost anyone in Parliament. Above all, when so many MPs scuttled obediently into the lobbies to vote for the Iraq War, he held his ground against it and was vindicated.\n\nMr Corbyn has earned the right to be listened to, and those who now try to smear him are not just doing something morally wrong. They are hurting the country. Look at our repeated rushes into foolish conflict in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan. All have done us lasting damage.\n\nEveryone I meet now thinks they were against the Iraq War (I know most of them weren't, but never mind). So that's over.\n\nBut Libya remains an unacknowledged disgrace. David Cameron has not suffered for it, and those who cheered it on have yet to admit they were mistaken.\n\nI disagree with Mr Corbyn about many things and actively loathe the way he has sucked up to Sinn Fein. But he has a better record on foreign policy than almost anyone in Parliament\n\nYet we pay for it, literally, every day. Along with our clinically insane covert intervention on the side of Al Qaeda in Syria, the Libyan adventure created the unending migration crisis across Europe which, in my view, threatens the stability of the whole continent.\n\nYet I recall a surge of anger from the audience when I doubted some crude war propaganda about mass rapes in Libya on the BBC's Question Time. War is strangely popular, until it comes to your own doorstep.\n\nI sense an even deeper and more thoughtless frenzy over Russia, a country many seem to enjoy loathing because they know so little about it.\n\nI have already been accused, on a public stage, of justifying Moscow's crime in Salisbury. This false charge was the penalty I paid for trying to explain the historical and political background to these events. I wonder if the bitterness also has something to do with the extraordinarily deep division over the EU, which has made opponents into enemies in a way not seen since the Suez Crisis.\n\nIn any case, the crude accusation, with its implication of treachery, frightened me. I expect, as time goes by, I will be accused of being an 'appeaser' and of being against 'British values'. And then what? An apparatus of thought policing is already in place in this country. By foolishly accepting bans on Muslim 'extremists', we have licensed public bodies to decide that other views, too, are 'extremist'.\n\nMr Corbyn has earned the right to be listened to, and those who now try to smear him are not just doing something morally wrong\n\nBecause the authorities are terrified of upsetting Islam, nothing much will happen to Muslim militants. But conservative and Christian views such as mine will suffer.\n\nChristian and Jewish schools, especially ones which have conservative views on marriage and sex education, increasingly find themselves in trouble. Even mainstream Catholic and C of E schools are under stealthy attack, with attempts made to stop them 'discriminating' in favour of pupils from Christian homes.\n\nOfsted now says that 'all schools' have a 'duty to actively promote fundamental British values', which sounds totalitarian to me. This includes so-called 'mutual respect and tolerance of values different from their own'. Actually, there is nothing mutual about it. The sexual revolution fanatics demand submission, and offer no tolerance in return. Now the freedom to educate children at home, always a barometer of liberty, is being seriously threatened for the first time in our history. The pretext for this is supposed fears of child abuse or 'extremism'. The real reason is that so much home education rejects the so-called 'British values' of multiculturalism and sexual liberation.\n\nWhat next? 'British values' over foreign policy, war, immigration? I expect so. TV and the internet have for years been promoting a leaden conformism, whose victims are actually shocked - and often angry - when anyone disagrees.\n\nThere's no real spirit of liberty left in this country.\n\nYes, I am scared, and I never have been before. And so should you be.\n\nWar, or the danger of war, is always an opportunity to silence troublemakers.\n\nIt will be a funny old world without Ken Dodd\n\nHow I wish I had been to see Ken Dodd before he died. He was a historical monument to a Britain of backyards, milkmen, brown ale, teatime biscuits, rent collectors, town clerks, vicars and mothers-in-law, all now endangered species. When everyone who remembers these things has gone, his humour will become a mystery, like a Cro-Magnon cave painting.\n\nHow I wish I had been to see Ken Dodd before he died.

The reason for its existence - the USSR - vanished decades ago. We don't keep up a huge alliance to protect us from the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Ottomans, or any other powers that have disappeared. So why this one? It was preserved to save the jobs and pensions of its staff. It was only expanded because American arms manufacturers were afraid they would lose business when the Cold War ended.\n\nSo they spent huge piles of cash lobbying the US Senate to back eastward expansion, as the New York Times uncovered. Having survived and expanded, it needed something to do, and began to infuriate the Russians, and so that is where we now are. If you look for trouble, you get it.\n\nHere's a true story from the days when we were bringing feminism and comprehensive schooling to Afghanistan, or whatever it was we were trying to do by sending troops there.\n\nIt is Christmas Day in a forward position. A young, idealistic officer, recently arrived from Sandhurst, says to a grizzled sergeant: 'It's jolly quiet today. Surely the Afghans don't observe Christmas?' And the sergeant replies: 'No sir, it's quiet because we're not going out there and annoying them.'\n\nI'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere.\n\nI couldn't care less if they melt down all the hideous one and two cent coins wrongly known as pennies and two pence pieces. Australia and New Zealand got rid of their equivalents nearly 20 years ago, and nobody seems to have suffered much.\n\nI couldn't care less if they melt down all the hideous one and two cent coins wrongly known as pennies and two pence pieces\n\nI was genuinely sad to see our real coinage go, proper heavy money that was worth something and a history lesson in your pocket. But these cheap, ugly, useless steel discs just remind me of how far we have fallen.\n\nLast week there was a mugging on the secluded, picturesque path I often take on my way home. It wasn't the first. For me, such places, away from crowds and noise, are one of the great joys of life. And, for all the time since I was born until very recently, it never crossed my mind that seclusion might also mean danger. Now it does. How very dispiriting and sad.\n\nThe Bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner, admitted last week it had been a mistake not to give the late Bishop George Bell a defending counsel at the kangaroo court which wrongly convicted him of child abuse\n\nThe Bishop of Chichester, Martin Warner, admitted last week it had been a mistake not to give the late Bishop George Bell a defending counsel at the kangaroo court which wrongly convicted him of child abuse. When will he admit that he has made a similar mistake by refusing to allow Bell's niece, Barbara Whitley, to pick a lawyer to defend him against the mysterious second allegation now levelled against him in secret? Too late, for sure.\n\nIf you want to comment on Peter Hitchens click here.", "She sits patiently in millions of homes, an unremarkable cylinder commonly referred to as Alexa. But Amazon's new 'virtual assistant' has been touted as nothing short of technological revolution.\n\nIn response to spoken commands, she answers questions which previously required an internet search, can perform mundane domestic tasks such as turning on lights, and makes online purchases - through Amazon, obviously.\n\nCan it all be as innocent as it seems, particularly in an age rife with internet snooping? Or is Alexa a spy? Some users have even reported 'bone-chilling' cackles emanating from their speakers at random moments.\n\nWhat, then, could possibly go wrong when Peter Hitchens welcomed Alexa into his Oxfordshire home?\n\nHow would Alexa fare with a grilling on matters ranging from Beethoven to Bob Dylan, and from the Mid-East crisis to Einstein's theory of relativity?\n\nI am enslaved by machines. But, like most slaves, I know deep down that I chose my fate. I calculated long ago that I preferred a life with mobile phones and computers to one without them. The price is high. It includes the loss of privacy, the unceasing availability to outsiders, the time wasted on the internet, the books unread, the conversations which never happened, the views from train windows that I completely missed as I checked my Twitter feed. I am sorry, but I am not that sorry.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong when Peter Hitchens welcomed Alexa into his Oxfordshire home?\n\nBut because my mind hardened before the age of the internet, I can resist much of it. Facebook is a mystery to me. I cannot see the point of it, or Snapchat or Instagram. My use of Twitter is brutally selfish, and if there were a Twitter Police, they would long ago have detained me for questioning.\n\nSo I am not the ideal subject for the new electronic fad, the thing most people call Alexa. This is a device about the size and shape of an extra-large family size can of baked beans, adorned with pretty flashing lights, now being widely promoted. The idea seems to be that you talk to it, it replies to you in a soothing voice and it then helps you buy things.\n\nBut I don't need this. I like to buy my food at markets, and my books (if possible) from bookshops. I mistrust electronic banking and won't use contactless cards. My experience of voice-activated switchboards is that they misunderstand all but the most simple words.\n\nSo with great reluctance I brought Alexa into my home, plugged it in and set it up. One of the first things I did was rename it. I didn't like the phoney familiarity of the Christian name. I wanted to call it Miss Amazon, since it has a female voice. But Amazon was as near as I could get. And I tried to get it to call me Mr Hitchens, but have so far failed.\n\nBut I began as I meant to go on. I was going to find out about Amazon, rather than the other way round. I asked it 'Do you tell lies?' and it answered: 'I don't lie, I'll always tell you what I know.' Did it keep a record of what I said? It responded (as it does to 99 per cent of awkward questions): 'I don't know that one.' Is it British? 'I live in the cloud, you could call me a Cloudian.' It was very keen on Jeff Bezos, boss of the Amazon company. It said he was 'kind' and that it 'would give him five stars'. But it did not endorse the Washington Post, the newspaper Jeff Bezos owns. It had no opinions on Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, or on Bill Gates, another internet mogul.\n\nDid it like money? Yes, and it says it especially likes the US dollar. What about the pound sterling? No opinions. Was it a communist? It didn't say yes and it didn't say no, but it believes in deep space exploration and hopes to live on Mars. I am sure it will fit in very well there.\n\nWorld peace? It had no opinions on that. Likewise, it had not given any thought to the two-state solution of the Israel-Arab conflict.\n\nWas it a Christian? A Muslim? Any questions about religious opinions were met with the same evasively inoffensive answer about people being entitled to their opinions.\n\nIt seemed to like all animals, even claiming to be fond of hairless rats, which struck me as a programmer's joke, stuck in the memory on the assumption nobody would ever ask.\n\nIt was basically American. It could go on at length about the US city of Baltimore, but had never heard of the original Baltimore, in Ireland. Yet when asked for weather forecasts it gave temperatures in Celsius, despite my pleas to do so in Fahrenheit - the scale normally used in the USA.\n\nIt was basically American. It could go on at length about the US city of Baltimore, but had never heard of the original Baltimore, in Ireland\n\nWhat about music? I had thought this might actually be a useful feature. My record collection from the 1960s and 1970s is more or less useless unless I go out and buy a retro record player. Would it play the second movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony (which is readily available on the internet via YouTube without payment)? No.\n\nInstead, it offered to give me a free trial of a music subscription service. When I rejected this, it sulkily began to emit a sort of nursery version of Beethoven, apparently played on a barrel organ or a xylophone, and I had to yell at it to stop.\n\nAnother member of my family managed, with intricate cunning, to trick it into playing a brief extract from a Johnny Cash song, but when I used the same method to get it to play Bob Dylan, it wouldn't respond. It didn't know any poetry, and couldn't recognise any quotations.\n\nBy this time our relationship was becoming frayed, and I had adopted a hectoring tone. At one point, in exasperation, I told it to get stuffed, and it responded by asking me: 'Do you want to buy stuff?' I think this moment revealed its true nature and purpose. It will do anything to get you to buy stuff.\n\nI asked if it knew any rude words, and it rambled off into a definition of expletives, before admitting to knowing the word 'damn'.\n\nWhen I asked it to explain what 'E' meant in Einstein's E=mc squared', it began to explain that 'E' was sometimes used as a name for Ecstasy, but when I tried to probe its opinions on illegal drugs, it resorted to giving technical descriptions of them.\n\nSo far, it has not started laughing eerily in the middle of the night, as some of these devices are said to have done.\n\nIn another suspicious experiment, I moved further and further from it to see how far away it could hear me. It turned out that it could pick up my voice from upstairs and from the neighbouring room, as long as the door was open.\n\nIf it was trying to spy on me for anyone, it had quite a long range. But of course that was just its obvious ability - its response to my voice saying 'Amazon'. I have no way of knowing how much it could hear and process without appearing to have been activated.\n\nIt showed no sign of remembering anything I had said to it before - though that does not mean it has not sent the information to some central point.\n\nThe only reassuring thing was that it was quite slow to wake up in the morning, or after I had been out. I had to speak the word of command twice to get it to illuminate.\n\nBut again, how did I know that its inner core hadn't been listening the whole time, or that it couldn't hear and record everything that was being said in the house? I didn't. I don't\n\nBut again, how did I know that its inner core hadn't been listening the whole time, or that it couldn't hear and record everything that was being said in the house? I didn't. I don't. Endearingly, it thought it was in Central London, rather than in my Oxford suburb, thanks to some computer peculiarity.\n\nI have, in fact, lived under surveillance when I was in the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Any foreign journalist in the USSR could assume that his flat was bugged. Friends of ours had come home to find their personal possessions subtly but obviously moved around and their computers switched on, a KGB calling card which said: 'We have our eye on you.'\n\nOthers met English students at parties who blushingly confessed that they had been recruited by the KGB to listen to them on tapes, and recognised their voices. I knew my car was bugged, as the microphone was installed so blatantly I couldn't miss it, and I would sometimes give it a whack as I drove along to make the listeners jump. My telephone would occasionally stop working, presumably when the tapes needed changing, and I would have to go to the exchange in the next block, and call my number up to laughing girls who would lean out of the upstairs windows when I banged on the door. By the time I got home it would always be working again.\n\nSo I am more curious than outraged at the idea someone might be eavesdropping on my life. On the other hand, I'd prefer it if they didn't, and see no reason to volunteer to be bugged, even if the listener is just a greedy commercial monster rather than a totalitarian state.\n\nWhat might I gain if I were kinder to Alexa, stopped calling her Amazon and entered into the spirit of things? Not much that I want. I suspect the TV equipment in my house is interactive - but that is mainly because I cannot get it to work and have to ask other members of my family to do the most basic things with it, such as turn it on. Even they sometimes struggle, as the procedures make no sense and are quite unmemorable. We have so many remote controls that I wonder if I need a remote control for the remote controls. If I made my lights, the central heating, the oven, or the fridge interactive as well, I might end up sitting in darkness, freezing and starving.\n\nOur cooking equipment is already so complicated that on some of my more fumbling, vague mornings, I wonder if I have accidentally downloaded the daily newspaper into the toaster, as it certainly hasn't arrived on my iPad, and there is a funny smell.\n\nAldous Huxley, whose 1930s nightmare Brave New World is coming into existence all around us, explained that he wrote his book because he was afraid we would come to love our own servitude, reduced by drugs and endless pleasure to passive, ignorant, thoughtless beings.\n\nThose who didn't fit in, he suggested, might find themselves being exiled to the Falkland Islands.

I am the Angel of Peace. Pray with me: My God I believe, I adore, I hope and I love You. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love You,\" the angel told three children in rural Portugal in that first of several supernatural encounters that would take place over the course of 1916 and 1917.\n\nWhen the Virgin Mary appeared to Lucia, Jacinta, and Francisco on May 13, 1917, she requested, \"Say the Rosary every day, to bring peace to the world and an end to the war.\"\n\nThe Great War did come to an end in 1918, but the story and secrets of Fatima continued to unfold after the first world war until the fall of Communism in 1989. The Virgin Mary entered into the bloodiest century in human history with a message of peace and prayer.\n\nIn many ways the events at Fatima encapsulate the history 20th century, and in the long history of the Church, they will be remembered for their deep connections to the most important milestones of the last century.\n\nToday a piece of the Berlin Wall stands in the Fatima square as a permanent monument to the apparition's connection to 1989. The Bolsheviks' October Revolution took place the same year as Fatima's \"Miracle of the Sun,\" and the Virgin Mary specifically requested that the pope consecrate Russia to Mary, in union with the bishops of the world.\n\nIn Fatima's museum, there is a rosary made from pieces of the Berlin Wall, a gift made by a Portuguese emigrant on May 13, 1991. There is also the ring that Pope John Paul II donated to Our Lady of Fatima in gratitude for her protection during the attempt on his life on May 13, 1981, a date that coincided with the anniversary of the Fatima apparitions. The ring had a special meaning to the pope; Cardinal Stephen Wszynski had given it to him at the beginning of his papacy in 1978. The pope also offered the bullet from the assassination attempt, which fit perfectly into Our Lady of Fatima's crown.World War II was also predicted by Our Lady of Fatima. \"God wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. If what I say to you is done, many souls will be saved and there will be peace. The war is going to end: but if people do not cease offending God, a worse one will break out during the Pontificate of Pius XI,\" recorded Lucia in her third memoir.\n\n\"Fatima is undoubtedly the most prophetic of modern apparitions. The first and second parts of the '~secret' . . . refer especially to the frightening vision of hell, devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Second World War, and finally the prediction of the immense damage that Russia would do to humanity by abandoning the Christian faith and embracing Communist totalitarianism,\" wrote the former Secretary of the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith Tarcisio Bertone.\n\nLucia dos Santos, the principal Fatima visionary died in 2005. Her niece, Maria dos Anjos, is still living across the street from Lucia's little house in Fatima. Now 98 years old, Anjos' life has spanned all but three years of Fatima's modern history.\n\n\"When she visited us Lucia always said ~Pray the rosary every day. That is what Our Lady asked,\" Anjos told CNA.\n\nAnjos also told CNA how much the city of Fatima has changed in her lifetime. Life across Europe has changed completely since 1917, she said. For one thing, children no longer work as shepherds.\n\nSaints Jacinta and Francisco Marto did not travel far within their short lifetimes. They lived simple, austere, and faithful lives. Both died of the Spanish flu pandemic that killed between 50 and 100 million people in the early 20th century.\n\nIn perhaps the most poignant symbol of a changing world, what was once the pasture of poor shepherds is now an international pilgrimage destination where people from South Korea, India, Australia, and all over the world come together seeking the sacred.", "Harsh words: Presidential candidate Marco Rubio criticized totalitarian regimes in a speech about foreign policy in South Carolina on Friday\n\nIt looks like Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has some harsh words to say about select world leaders.\n\nIn a speech on foreign policy in South Carolina on Friday, Rubio accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a 'gangster' and called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a 'lunatic'.\n\nRubio made comments about Russia, North Korea, China, Iran and 'jihadists' around the world and questioned the totalitarian regimes in those regions, claiming that the United States should be spreading democracy.\n\nThe foreign policy hawk saved his harshest words for Putin.\n\n'Russia is governed today by a gangster,' Rubio said, according to CNN. 'He's basically an organized crime figure who controls a government and a large territory...\n\n'This is a person who kills people because they're his political enemies. If you're a political adversary of Vladimir Putin, you wind up with plutonium in your drink or shot in the street.\n\n'He also called Russia one of the top five threats to the United States, saying we have a gangster running the largest nuclear stockpile in the world.'\n\nRubio's comments on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un weren't much less harsh.\n\n'In North Korea, a lunatic possesses dozens of nuclear weapons, and a long-range missile that can hit the United States,' he said.\n\nOn the heels of President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, Rubio also called out Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n'Iran: A radical, Shi'ite cleric is going to develop a nuclear weapon, and he will also have a long-range missile that can hit the United States,' he said.\n\nRubio questioned Latin American countries stances on the United States, claiming Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela are anti-American.\n\nRubio, a foreign policy hawk, called Russian President Vladimir Putin a 'gangster' and 'basically an organized crime figure'\n\n'Argentina seems to be wanting to join them, at least as long as this lady is running the country,' he said of the country and its president, Cristina Fernandez.\n\nRubio is a Cuban-American who has several 'neo-conservative' advisers linked to the administration of former President George W Bush.\n\nHe is polling in the top half of the 17 Republicans vying for the party's nomination for the November 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe promised to end 'sequestration' defense cuts and restore U.S. military spending to earlier levels.\n\n'Doing so will allow us to neutralize the threat posed by China's rapidly growing forces and capabilities. We'll ensure that our carrier fleet is sufficient to support forward deployment of a second carrier to the Pacific,' he said.\n\nRubio also vowed to fortify U.S. cyber defenses 'to pressure China to halt its use of commercial espionage as a tool of statecraft.'\n\nRubio also called out North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in his speech, dubbing him a 'lunatic' who 'possesses dozens of nuclear weapons", "Senate President Aquilino Pimentel (left) and House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez chat during deliberations to extend martial law in the southern Philippines, at the session hall of the House of Representatives in Manila, Dec. 13, 2017. AFP\n\nPhilippine senators promised Wednesday to block proposals in Congress to change the country's constitution and replace the current presidential form of government with a federal one.\n\nThe proposal, backed by President Rodrigo Duterte, aims to devolve powers of the central government in Manila to federal states, but there are widespread fears in the country that politicians could exploit any changes to the 1987 constitution to extend term limits.\n\nThe constitution specifically allows only a single, six-year term for a president to guard against the repetition of a dictatorship similar to that of Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Southeast Asian country with an iron fist for two decades.\n\n\"I doubt that any senator, opposition or administration, will allow a bastardization of the Constitutionally-mandated process,\" according to Sen. Paolo Benigno \"Bam\" Aquino, one of those lawmakers who oppose the move.\n\nDuterte is to deliver his second State of the Nation Address before Congress next week, and some worry that the president could use the joint session to convene a constituent assembly in a sudden bid to revise the charter, Aquino said.\n\nBoth houses of Congress - the Senate and the House of Representatives - are likely to convene into a constituent assembly to introduce a charter change, though that would need a three-fourths vote of all members and could take time.\n\nBoth have different interpretations of how to vote, whether jointly or separately.\n\nSen. Risa Hontiveros said she doubted that the plan to introduce federalism was feasible.\n\n\"Aside from the massive democratic deficit President Duterte's version of federalism suffers from, I am worried that his federalist vision is not even economically viable and practical in the first place,\" she said.\n\n\"Instead of redistributing wealth and dispersing economic development to the regions, President Duterte's federalism might only make the regions poorer and their economies weaker,\" Hontiveros said.\n\nShe said a study to assess Philippine provinces' readiness for federalism showed that only five of the 16 federated regions, which have been proposed for creation, were relatively prepared.\n\nHontiveros noted that even the government's own budget minister had earlier expressed worries that not all the regions were ready for a sudden shift to federalism that, she argued, could be costly.\n\nHontiveros called on government not to railroad the country's shift to federalism, saying there were many issues that needed to be deliberated and addressed first.\n\n\"It's bad enough that the Duterte government is planning to employ undemocratic processes such as a Senate-less constituent assembly to change our constitution,\" she said. \"Now, the citizens must also contend with the bad economics of President Duterte's federalism.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the No to Charter Change Coalition, a broad grouping led by retired Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide, has been created to raise public awareness and widen the public opposition to charter change.\n\nDavide, one of the framers of the 1987 constitution, called charter change \"a real fatal experiment\" aimed at weakening democracy in the country.\n\n\"The biggest flaw here would be that what is created is a weak democracy with ingredients of totalitarian and fascism,\" Davide warned Wednesday.\n\nA group earlier commissioned by Duterte to draft a proposed federal constitution submitted its report and recommendations early this month.", "Column: Summits won't change the nature of the North Korean tyranny\n\n\"This will not be just a photo op,\" President Trump said Thursday of his meeting next week with Kim Jong Un. \"This will be -- at a minimum, we'll start with, perhaps, a good relationship. And that's something that's very important toward the ultimate making of a good deal.\" Later that day the president added that he might, if things go well, invite Kim to visit him in the United States, perhaps even at the White House. \"He has also discussed [possibly] golfing with Kim,\" a \"senior Trump administration official\" told the Daily Beast.\n\nGolf? Too soon, Mr. President. Unless this is part of a strategy to get under Kim's skin -- he'll be uncomfortable, after all, when he hits the links at Mar-a-Lago wearing charcoal fatigues. More likely it's another example of the president's view that relations between leaders are more important than the relationships between states, regimes, cultures, and ideas. You try to woo Xi Jinping with \"a most beautiful\" piece of chocolate cake, for example. Even if the results are not ultimately what you wished for.\n\nLet's remind ourselves of whom, exactly, President Trump plans to meet next week. For Kim Jong Un is no ordinary man. The Dear Leader occupies the summit of a hierarchical system of some 25 million people whose lives are controlled by his central government in Pyongyang. Some years ago, Christopher Hitchens described the ruling juche ideology this way: \"It is based on totalitarian 'military first' mobilization, is maintained by slave labor, and instills an ideology of the most unapologetic racism and xenophobia.\" He did not mention the troops and artillery North Korea has amassed on its southern border, and the engineers who toil in underground laboratories, building nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States.\n\nKim, his father and grandfather, and the regime they direct have given no indication, ever, that they recognize the dignity and worth of human life. Some 36,000 Americans died fighting off the north and its Chinese ally between 1950 and 1953. The North Korean government caused a famine in the 1990s that killed somewhere between hundreds of thousands and more than one million people. Another hundred thousand or so are imprisoned, right now, in the North Korean gulag where slaves are starved, beaten, tortured, and killed. Even high-ranking officials are subject to \"liquidation\" by sickening methods, including execution by a firing squad of anti-aircraft batteries.\n\nA 2014 U.N. report found that\n\nSystematic, widespread, and gross human rights violations have been, and are being, committed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, its institutions and officials. In many instances, the violations of human rights found by the Commission constitute crimes against humanity. These are not mere excesses of the state. They are essential components of a political system that has moved far from the ideals on which it claims to be founded. The gravity, scale, and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world.\n\nNo parallel. And no conscience. From the U.S. State Department's \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017:\n\nThe people of North Korea faced egregious human rights violations by the government in nearly all reporting categories including: extrajudicial killings; disappearances; arbitrary arrests and detentions; torture; political prison camps in which conditions were often harsh, life threatening, and included forced and compulsory labor; unfair trials; rigid controls over many aspects of citizens' lives, including arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence, and denial of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement; denial of the ability to choose their government; coerced abortion; trafficking in persons; severe restrictions on worker rights, including denial of the right to organize independent unions and domestic forced labor through mass mobilizations and as a part of the reeducation system.\n\nWhat Kim Jong Un is, is a monster. And that monstrousness informs his statecraft. It influences the means he adopts to remain in power. It leads him to deceive, dissemble, brutalize. And build a nuclear deterrent.\n\nWhy would he trade it away? Maybe for reassurance -- but such pledges can be reversed at a moment's notice. Maybe for a lot of dough -- though he always could turn the missile machine back on when and if the money disappeared. Maybe because he felt backed into a corner -- but who knows what China, Russia, and Syria have been whispering in his ear.\n\nSingapore is an opportunity for Trump to size up an adversary. At best it will inspire Kim to take verifiable steps towards disarmament. At worst, it will send the sort of mixed signal that has led to disaster. But as you watch the proceedings, do not allow the following to happen: Do not permit the smiles and handshakes to obscure the evil reality of Kim Jong Un -- or the memory of his victims.", "Despite its dark past, Berlin continues to appease a regime seeking to murder six million Jews\n\nGermany of all countries should appreciate the need -- indeed, the obligation -- of free societies to take a strong and consistent stand against a murderous and anti-Semitic regime. Yet Berlin, which has gone to great lengths to atone for its own crimes under such a regime, refuses to back the U.S. in confronting the Islamic Republic of Iran, which seeks to destroy Israel.\n\nJust this past weekend, for example, press reports revealed that Berlin is considering Tehran's plan to use the European-Iranian trade bank in Hamburg to transfer 300 million euros in cash back to Iran to circumvent pending U.S. sanctions. Israeli and American officials are concerned that Iran, the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, will use the money to finance terrorist activities. (Of course the Iranian facilitating the transfer, Ali Tarzali, a senior official with Iran's Central Bank, is subject to U.S. sanctions for supporting terrorist groups.)\n\nThe Trump administration is working to stop Germany from allowing Tehran to withdraw the cash. Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, urged Berlin to intervene, only to be rebuffed by Johann Wadephul, deputy leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in parliament. Wadephul said the transaction \"should not be blocked on political grounds if it passed legal muster,\" according to Reuters, reflecting the sentiments of Merkel's cabinet. The Iranian plan could be legal -- that remains to be seen -- but regardless, it would be shameful and dangerous of Germany to facilitate the transfer when it could block it.\n\nBerlin has made repeated efforts to continue providing Iran with sanctions relief, hindering U.S. efforts to push back on the Islamic Republic's brutality and belligerence. German businesses rushed into Iran after the nuclear deal -- officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA -- was struck in 2015, with the German government eager to improve bilateral relations. After President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear accord in May, promising to re-impose sanctions on Iran lifted under the deal, Germany has worked furiously to preserve the agreement and continue business with the Islamic Republic. The German government last month created a special office -- what the Economy Ministry calls an \"Iran contact point\" -- to advise companies worried that their business dealings with Iran may trigger U.S. sanctions. The ministry stressed, as Merkel did this week, that Germany is committed to its sanctions relief for Iran. Merkel added that individual firms should decide on their own whether they want to invest in Iran, without indicating the slightest hint of a tougher posture toward Tehran.\n\nBerlin's moral compass is no longer pointing north. It supports Iran's Islamist theocracy over the U.S., sacrificing its soul. For the sake of what?\n\nCommercial interests are likely not the main motivation, despite many journalists and analysts' claims to the contrary. After all, Germany's exports to and imports from Iran make up a tiny sliver of its total trade (0.27 and 0.032 percent in 2017, respectively).\n\nAnother possible explanation for Germany's behavior is political indignation toward Trump. Trump's demand that NATO members, especially Germany, spend more on defense certainly irked Berlin, as did his proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. and general hostility toward free trade. Most western European leaders clearly loathe Trump, none more so than Merkel and her colleagues. \"Where has our dear friend Barack gone?\" I imagine they ask behind closed doors, seeing Trump's behavior and nationalism as simpleminded and unsophisticated. Moreover, European leaders saw the decision to withdraw from the Iran deal as a slap in the face, heightening their determination not to appear to be at the mercy of Washington's whims and fearful of its sanctions.\n\nA third explanation is more abstract. It concerns Germany's lack of military power and refusal to believe that military force can and should be used to resolve international disputes.\n\nThere is an ideology deeply entrenched in parts of Europe, especially Germany and the European Union, that sees negotiations and reconciliation, bolstered by trade and other forms of economic interdependence, as the only way to settle conflicts between states. Grand diplomatic achievements, like the JCPOA, are the ultimate prize. Trashing such a deal, therefore, is a sin of the worst kind in this secular religion. Diplomacy between sophisticated bureaucrats, according to this worldview, is the way to keep conflict at bay, to keep the barbarians -- those who believe in the efficacy of hard power -- from entering the city gates. The theory underpinning this belief system is that everyone, no matter how hostile, will be seduced by the West's goods, services, cafes, and money. And so the hard men of Iran will eventually lay down their weapons, choosing instead to enjoy the latest European fads.\n\nOf course all of this is hogwash, but don't doubt for a moment how firmly German leaders believe it -- because if it isn't true, then Germany has no real power on the world stage, at least to resolve the most pressing matters.\n\nGermany, like other European countries, defends its Iran policy by saying the only alternative to the JCPOA and reconciliation is war. But Iran, like any revisionist power, will only become more emboldened if it does not meet resistance. That goes for all aspects of Iran's belligerence -- from its nuclear program, to its own internal repression, to its complicity in Syria's mass slaughter.\n\nGermany does not seem to recognize the irony of its approach to Iran. Merkel was quick to take in refugees from Syria en masse -- a noble if misguided policy -- before she reversed her decision. Yet Merkel's government eagerly moves to strike business deals with Iran, indirectly funding the regime that most robustly supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's war machine -- which caused the refuges to flee to Europe in the first place!\n\nBerlin has an opportunity to take on a global leadership role in countering Iran and taking a stand against true totalitarianism. To do this, Germany must speak out against the regime and support the Iranian people protesting against their government. This means supporting freedom and human rights, not just paying them lip service. The Germans must also separate the Iran issue from other contentious ones to work with Trump to ensure sanctions are effective, to contain and ultimately roll back Tehran's imperialist expansion across the Middle East, and to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.\n\nGermany also must confront Iran about its egregious anti-Semitism, including its Holocaust denial and determination to destroy Israel. More than 70 years ago, six million Jews were slaughtered in the darkest chapter of human history. Germany has a moral obligation to ensure that Iran's repeated calls to exterminate another six million never come to fruition.", "Former vice president Lien Chan (\u9023\u6230) has once again visited China to pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nWhile Lien and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Wu Den-yih (\u5433\u6566\u7fa9) said the trip was private and that Lien does not represent the party, it hardly makes much difference.\n\nSince the first transition of power and the KMT's expulsion of former president Lee Teng-hui (\u674e\u767b\u8f1d), KMT members throughout the party hierarchy have scrambled to surrender to Beijing.\n\nIn the eyes of Taiwanese, who were forced to subscribe to the ideology of \"eliminating the communist bandits, fighting communism and restoring the nation,\" the KMT -- a political group that rose to power on the back of its \"anti-communism\" stance -- has given up all opposition and is now leading the rush to fawn on the communist regime.\n\nThis is both awkward and bizarre, and represents the least ambitious phase throughout the KMT's transformation.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the KMT trumpeted political slogans, such as \"destroy the communist bandits and expel the Russian marauders,\" \"retake the mainland and save our compatriots,\" \"take revenge and restore the nation,\" \"recover the nation\" and \"never forget the nation's humiliation in times of peace and security.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, the slogans were \"no compromise with communists -- freedom can only be achieved through struggle,\" \"patriotism means fighting communism, fighting communism requires unity\" and \"remain calm, self-reliant and dignified in times of adversity.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, the party proclaimed that it would \"unify China with the Three Principles of the People.\"\n\nDespite the modifications over the years, these slogans at least preserved the party's integrity and underlined its political stance.\n\nHowever, both have gradually subsided into oblivion with the passing of Chiang Kai-shek (\u8523\u4ecb\u77f3) and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo (\u8523\u7d93\u570b), to whom KMT members pledge their loyalty.\n\nAll these bold and daring slogans are now gone, replaced by the so-called \"1992 consensus,\" \"one China, different interpretations,\" \"one China, one interpretation,\" \"the two sides of the strait are one family,\" and \"the Republic of China Army and the People's Liberation Army are both China's army.\"\n\nPeople who once called for \"keeping our secrets and watching out for spies\" and said that \"reporting spies is everyone's responsibility\" now behave and speak almost like the \"communist spies\" of yore.\n\nPeople who once called Taiwanese independence advocates the \"running dogs of the communist bandits\" now flock to Beijing, forming an alliance with the CCP to constrain Taiwan.\n\nThe change from \"eliminating the communist bandits\" to the current alliance with China to constrain Taiwan poses the question of whether China has become a democracy or if Taiwan has become a totalitarian state.\n\nNeither is the case -- there is no trace of liberalization or democratization of the authoritarian regime in China, a nation that scored only 14 out of 100 in Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2018 report, as the regime becomes increasingly totalitarian with Chinese President Xi Jinping's (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73) emperor-like lifelong presidency.\n\nWhile the authoritarian CCP regime is eyeing Taiwan, which scored 93 in the survey, the KMT curiously no longer takes to heart its past slogans, such as \"no compromise with communists, freedom can only be achieved through struggle\" or \"patriotism means fighting communism, fighting communism requires unity.\"", "Learning to lie is an important stage of child development. It indicates cognitive and social maturity. The tiny child who has chocolate cake smeared all over its face will say \"No, I didn't eat the cake.\" It's cute and funny when little kids do it. They think they can fool us. They don't understand that other people have minds of their own.\n\nThe next part of development is learning that they do. This is called theory of mind. As small children, we learn that other people have different thoughts or feelings or desires to our own. That's a pretty complicated thing to learn, when you think about it. We learn to interpret other people's behaviour this way. At around four years old, something crucial happens, and children start to understand that their own thoughts might not be \"true\". We learn to see things from someone's else point of view.\n\nI keep thinking about this as lying has now become the modus operandi of so many of our leaders. Well ... not lying exactly, but obfuscation. Dizzying denials. Robert Winston once said that when discussing child development that children who learn to lie convincingly may well be more successful than those who don't. This is because he connects it to social intelligence. Good liars need this.\n\nSo what is happening now? The general discombobulation that so many are feeling now is to do with the fact that they are such bad liars with limited social intelligence. These are toddlers with cake smeared on theirs faces saying they have never seen the cake. They know we can see them lying and they don't much care. They misspeak.\n\nApparently this is just part of living in a post-truth world. Post-truth is spoken about as though it's the weather: just something that happens, over which we have no control. Russia has been post-truth for ages, say the old hands. Social media has made it possible for everyone to believe everything. Postmodernism is blamed for making us think everything is relative. Really? Surely that went out of the window when Salman Rushdie was threatened with death for writing a book. There wasn't much that was relative about a fatwa.\n\nHannah Arendt outlined the \"ideological fictions\" that a populace has to accept for a totalitarian leader to reign. Kellyanne Conway didn't bother with such theories, she just named the practice as \"alternative facts\". All these are convincing explanations on their own for the suspension of belief currently required of us. A lot of the current news is literally unbelievable. When the former Times journalist Louis Heren (although the line is often wrongly attributed to Jeremy Paxman) told us that he approached every interview with a politician thinking \"Why is this lying bastard lying to me?\" it felt slightly over the top. Some MPs are perfectly decent, we said. It all leads to a confrontational style that is very wearing.\n\nBut the nice guys are not in the ascendant. We have Donald Trump. We have Steve Bannon screaming at radio producers in London as he defends Tommy Robinson (not even his actual name). We have Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson with their serial bullshit; we have Michael Gove, whose mind is, shall we say, changeable. Then there are the endless denials, followed by so-whatery, by those who financed the leave campaign. Some of the media is hampered and flummoxed by some outdated notions of impartiality. It needs to be on the side of truth rather than of \"heated debate\".\n\nBarack Obama addressed this in his first major speech since leaving office, although he didn't name Trump. He spoke of the \"utter loss of shame among political leaders when they are caught in a lie and they just double down and lie some more\". He told us that for democracy to work \"we have to believe in objective reality, we have to believe in facts\".\n\nThis is true. Facts, evidence and a refusal to accept \"alternative facts\" on subjects such as climate change would be good.The result of all this is a loss of faith, but worse, a form of paralysis that allows us to be ruled by the new breed of US and British oligarchs. For this is what they are. They lie as they breathe.\n\nThey are the two-year-olds who think we can't see though them. But we can. We are not yet at the point in which we can no longer see the truth, though I fear we may no longer care.\n\nInstead, everyone feels like they are going a bit mad. Because that is what is feels like to be lied to all the time. We are being collectively gaslighted and it will only stop when enough of us insist that there is something called truth, that we hold it dear and that we will fight for it.\n\n* Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist", "Most of us agree that if there is one thing that binds the peoples of our islands together, it is our shared sense of humour.\n\nFrom Shakespeare's plays and Dickens's villains to the novels of P.G. Wodehouse, the surrealism of Monty Python and the gentle comedy of Dad's Army, we like to think of ourselves as a uniquely funny people, brought together by our ability to laugh even in the blackest situation.\n\nTo foreigners, of course, our blend of sarcasm, irony and outright farce often seems mystifying.\n\nBut they never deny that there is something exceptional about it. 'If you want to succeed here,' advised George Mikes, a Hungarian exile who became one of the best-loved comic writers of the Fifties and Sixties, 'you must be able to handle the English sense of humour.'\n\nWhat Mr Gove said apparently sent shock waves throughout the nation, or at least that part of it that reads the Guardian\n\nBut are we ourselves still capable of handling it? Apparently not, if the fallout from Michael Gove's joke about the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is anything to go by.\n\nIn case you missed it, Mr Gove was a guest on a special edition of Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday morning. The presenter, John Humphrys, asked if politicians feared that interviewers would make them look silly.\n\nWhat Mr Gove said next apparently sent shock waves throughout the nation, or at least that part of it that reads the Guardian.\n\n'Sometimes I think that coming into the studio with you, John, is a bit like going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom,' he said, to appreciative chuckles from the audience. 'You just pray that you emerge with your dignity intact.'\n\nAt that, his fellow guest, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, chipped in. 'John goes way past groping,' he said, 'way past groping.'\n\nThis was the cue for all sorts of weeping and gnashing of teeth -- by Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy and the Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, all of whom were quick to condemn Mr Gove -- but not, revealingly, Lord Kinnock -- and to demand an apology.\n\nWithin minutes Mr Gove had tweeted an apology, presumably having calculated that it was better to beat a swift retreat than let it drag on.\n\nWithin minutes Mr Gove had tweeted an apology, presumably having calculated that it was better to beat a swift retreat than let it drag on. But should he have apologised?\n\nBut should he have apologised? Well, at the risk of provoking a chorus of execration, I think Mr Gove should have told his critics to take a running jump.\n\nWith the sanctimonious self-importance that has become her trademark, Ms Sturgeon declared that 'women being abused and raped is not a laughing matter'.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I should stress that I don't find women being abused at all funny.\n\nBut it's none of my business to tell other people what they should laugh at, any more than it's Ms Sturgeon's business to tell other people what jokes they can make and which ones they can laugh at.\n\nAnd yes, of course Mr Gove's quip was a bit tasteless. But wasn't that the point? Isn't humour often intended to be tasteless? Isn't that what makes it funny?\n\nIn this latest case, there is, of course, a very obvious political subtext. It is no coincidence that almost all the criticism has come from the Left, which seems determined to drive humour out of our national life for good.\n\nGove's fellow guest, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, chipped in. 'John goes way past groping,' he said, 'way past groping'\n\nRemember New Labour's Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, which Tony Blair tried to push through 11 years ago?\n\nThis would have made it a crime to say anything that might provoke 'religious hatred' -- even if you were a stand-up comedian making a weak joke about a Christian, a Muslim and a Sikh walking into a bar.\n\nAfter loud protests from comedians and writers, the Bill was defeated. Unfortunately, the forces behind it have never gone away.\n\nIndeed, as the furore surrounding Mr Gove shows, they are more intolerant than ever.\n\nRead any column in that newsletter of the metropolitan chattering classes, the Guardian, and what is striking is the absence of levity.\n\nEverything is deadly serious. Humour must be suppressed, lest it undercut the Guardianistas' horror at the supposedly dreadful state of what is actually one of the richest, safest and most contented societies in human history.\n\nBut they are merely the heirs to a long tradition of highbrow humourlessness. For despite our reputation as an exceptionally funny people, Britain is also the land of the Puritans, whose legacy survives.\n\nIn the 1650s, having lopped off the head of Charles I, these miserable, buttoned-up busybodies tried to ban dancing, gambling, make-up, football, swearing, theatres and, most famously, Christmas.\n\nYou don't have to look far to spot their modern-day descendants, from snowflake students who want to ban Halloween costumes to po-faced Labour MPs who would like to see Mr Gove thrown into the stocks.\n\nWhat drives people such as the strident Labour MP Laura Pidcock, who famously boasted that she would never befriend a Tory MP because they are the 'enemy', is an implacable sense of their own seriousness.\n\nSuffused with moral self-righteousness, they exist in a permanent state of near-hysteria, infuriated by ordinary people's failure to live up to their lofty ideals.\n\nGeorge Orwell, the supreme scourge of the high-minded Left, maintained that humour was inherently political. 'Every joke is a tiny revolution,' he wrote in 1945. 'If you had to define humour in a single phrase, you might define it as dignity sitting on a tin-tack. Whatever destroys dignity, and brings down the mighty from their seats, preferably with a bump, is funny.'\n\n'Mr Gove has nothing to apologise for. Indeed, I think he should tell even more jokes, no matter how tasteless'\n\nThis, of course, is why totalitarian regimes always try to suppress humour. In Stalin's Soviet Union, ordinary citizens who joked about the gulf between the regime's Communist propaganda and its drab, depressing reality were liable to be dragged off to the labour camps.\n\nFor totalitarian regimes depend on a sense of their own dignity. Once you debunk that, once you point a mocking finger at their defects, then the whole edifice begins to collapse.\n\nThe high-minded think of themselves as a moral and intellectual elite, chosen to lead the rest of us towards the kingdom of heaven, or rather the kingdom of Corbyn.\n\nIf Mr Gove offended their sensibilities, so much the better. Nobody likes being offended, but it is good for us.\n\nIt reminds us of our weaknesses; it punctures our self-importance. If we lose our sense of humour, we lose what comes with it: a sense of humility and perspective.\n\nBut the high-minded Left want a nation of latter-day Puritans, constantly seething with righteous indignation, too busy building the New Jerusalem to bother with anything so trivial as a mere joke.\n\nWhat a dreary place their ideal country would be! No colour, no laughter, everything subordinated to the pursuit of 'social justice', to use their own sanctimonious jargon. It wouldn't be much fun.\n\nMore importantly, it wouldn't be Britain.\n\nSo Mr Gove has nothing to apologise for. Indeed, I think he should tell even more jokes, no matter how tasteless.\n\nAfter all, there's one thing the Left hate more than anything else. Like so many humourless prigs through the ages, they just can't stand seeing other people laughing.", "With the World Cup starting next week in Moscow, it is not surprising that Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine is revving up its engines.\n\nWhat is surprising, though, is that one of the BBC's best-known sports presenters has appointed himself as Putin's chief defender.\n\nAccording to Gary Lineker, British fans should stop questioning Fifa's decision to award the World Cup to Russia.\n\n'Who are we to start getting judgmental on who should have the World Cup?' he has told the Radio Times. 'We all know how corrupt our country is at times.'\n\nNow, I bow to nobody in my admiration of Lineker's record on the pitch. But to hear him parroting one of the Kremlin's favourite propaganda lines -- 'Who are you to judge us? You Westerners are no saints!' -- feels like a betrayal.\n\nWe in Britain have every right to be judgmental.\n\nLineker defended Russia this week by saying there were people in Britain who were 'just as corrupt'\n\nQuite apart from the fact that we invented the game, we have the good fortune to live in one of the world's least corrupt countries.\n\nAs for Russia, its appalling record of racism and homophobia alone would have disbarred it from consideration as a World Cup host, were it not for the fact that Fifa lost its moral compass decades ago.\n\nThere are the political assassinations, the murders of journalists, the invasion of Ukraine, the repression of dissent, the financial corruption, the Salisbury poisonings . . . well, you get the drift.\n\nBut more on Russia in a moment.\n\nFirst, a word or two about Gary Lineker, the man Esquire magazine calls 'the voice of liberal Britain'.\n\nHe has successfully reinvented himself as a leading sports presenter, with a salary of more than \u00a31.75 million and a lucrative sideline as a crisp salesman.\n\nSince discovering Twitter, he's relentlessly fired out opinions on everything from Brexit (anti) to Donald Trump (anti) to millions of followers. Of course he has every right. Even so, I can't help wondering whether he's become rather too keen on the sound of people applauding his holier-than-thou, oh-so- virtuous opinions.\n\nAt the very least there is surely something absurd about a man whose wages are paid by people's TV licence fees telling us 'how corrupt our country is'.\n\nOf course, this is also a man who invested in a scheme which offered significant tax relief and which a head of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs once famously referred to as 'scams for scumbags'.\n\nLineker rushed onto Twitter to clarify his Radio Times remarks. 'There is corruption in all countries,' he wrote, 'including our own. Where do you start?'\n\nBut this is the Kremlin's line yet again. And since he asks where to start, why not start with the figures?\n\nEvery year, the highly regarded anti-corruption group Transparency International measures everything from small-scale bribery to major financial corruption in every country in the world.\n\nMore from Dominic Sandbrook for the Daily Mail...

In fact, an awful lot better than every other major footballing country and, indeed, every other potential World Cup host.\n\nSo although we're not perfect, we're not corrupt. Not by historical standards, and not by contemporary standards, either.\n\nAnd Russia? It's 135th.\n\nYou can probably guess what the Kremlin thinks of Transparency International.\n\nPutin's government classes it as a 'foreign agent', claiming that like other Western anti-corruption groups, it is motivated by sinister anti- Russian resentment.\n\nBut even if Transparency International isn't good enough for Lineker, has he ever tried reading a newspaper?\n\nTo give an obvious example, the Russian state routinely murders journalists, such as the anti-corruption writer Maksim Borodin, who mysteriously 'fell' from a window in Yekaterinburg, a World Cup host city, in April. By contrast, the British government does not kill journalists, no matter how disobliging.\n\nYou can be as rude as you like about Theresa May, but she will not tell MI5 to throw you off a tall building.\n\nWhen foreign journalists, such as the BBC's John Sweeney, visit Russia to report on corruption, they are tailed, harassed and even arrested by the authorities.\n\nThat would not happen in Britain. You simply do not see foreign TV crews being pursued down the street by malevolent bobbies.\n\nWhat else? Well, Britain does not hand billions of pounds' worth of state assets to a handful of semi-criminal oligarchs, who then risk being thrown into jail -- as happened to media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky and oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- if they fall out with the Putin regime.\n\nNor do we rig our general elections.\n\nWhen Putin was re-elected in March with more than 76 per cent of the vote, the main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, wasn't allowed to stand, which meant the whole thing was a charade.\n\nAlso, foreign observers agreed that officials routinely stashed voting slips in ballot boxes, while the Russian election expert Sergey Shpilkin suggested that Putin benefited from about ten million illegal votes.\n\nOur government would not invade neighbouring countries if they were run by administrations we did not like, as Putin did when the Ukrainians booted out his puppet Viktor Yanukovych -- a man so corrupt he had a private zoo and spent $42 million on light fittings.\n\nNor do we regularly harass and intimidate our neighbours, as Mr Putin does to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nPresident Putin's propaganda machine has sprung into action in recent weeks to herald the start of the tournament\n\nFinally, and perhaps most obviously, we don't send agents abroad to poison people with chemical weapons, as the Russians did in Salisbury. (As if that were not enough, a fervently pro-Kremlin television presenter told his audience that this had been the handiwork of the British authorities, explaining that the London government wanted to whip up anti-Russian feeling before the World Cup).\n\nSo when Gary Lineker asks, 'Who are we to start getting judgmental on who should have the World Cup?', I'd start with all that.\n\nAnd then I'd throw in the seizure of Crimea, the vicious racism, the hate campaigns against gays and lesbians, and the anti-Western propaganda peddled by lie machines such as the Kremlin-backed TV station RT (formerly Russia Today).\n\nNone of this, surely, can be lost on Lineker. He is not a fool. Indeed, he is clearly very sensitive about the stereotype that footballers are stupid, which perhaps explains why he spends so much time tweeting his political opinions.\n\nSo why on earth does he deny the obvious? What could conceivably explain his new-found enthusiasm for Vladimir Putin?\n\nWell, I hate to be cynical, but there is one possible explanation.\n\nFour years ago, Lineker said that Fifa made him feel 'sick . . . the corruption at the top level is nauseous'. He also suggested that all 'clean' countries should boycott the World Cup in Russia.\n\nBut then, in December, Fifa held the World Cup draw in the State Kremlin Palace, Moscow. And the main presenter, who was paid a reported \u00a320,000, and who told reporters that he was delighted to see a 'proper football country' hosting the tournament, was none other than .. . Gary Lineker.\n\nAnd this is the man who, by an extraordinary coincidence, pops up six months later to tell us how corrupt Britain is and how we have no right to judge poor, maligned, misunderstood Russia.\n\n'It'll be fine,' Lineker says of the tournament in Russia. 'It'll be great . . . The people of Russia have actually been very welcoming.'\n\nNo doubt they have, Gary. After all, they know a useful idiot when they see one.", "For anyone who loves our country, enjoys a spectacle or just likes a good wedding, today promises to be a great occasion. All royal weddings come with a generous sprinkling of stardust, but the union of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is something extraordinary.\n\nEven two or three decades ago, the prospect of the Queen's grandson, the son and brother of future kings, marrying a divorced American actress, born to a black mother, would have seemed inconceivable.\n\nNot even the most ambitious screenwriter in Ms Markle's native Los Angeles would have come up with such a scenario. But times have changed, and for the better.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their wedding\n\nAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry -- seasoned in service to his country -- has found happiness at last.\n\nGood for him. He deserves it.\n\nThis being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.\n\nEven by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan's semi-estranged father Thomas -- who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours -- marks a tragi-comic low point.\n\nStill, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.\n\nIn any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.\n\nMore from Dominic Sandbrook for the Daily Mail...

We've forgotten the lessons of history! 22/01/18 VIEW FULL ARCHIVE\n\nThink, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a 'Flanders mare' who seemed completely out of her depth.\n\nNot surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the 'hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh'.\n\nThe real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.\n\nAs she shuffled down the aisle at St James's Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.\n\nThe most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.\n\nThey first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride's appearance that he immediately called for brandy.\n\nAt the wedding itself, again at St James's Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.\n\nMeghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust's Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry\n\nSomehow George managed to consummate the marriage that evening, though he told friends afterwards that 'it required no small [effort] to conquer my aversion and overcome the disgust of her person'.\n\nFor her part, Caroline was equally horrified, and claimed that he 'passed the greatest part of his bridal night under the grate, where he fell, and where I left him'.\n\nThis set the tone for what was to follow, climaxing with the chaotic scenes at George's coronation in 1821, when the doors of Westminster Abbey were literally slammed in his estranged wife's face. To cap it all, Caroline was taken ill that night and died three weeks later.\n\nThere is, I suppose, a valuable lesson here in the dangers of choosing an unsuitable royal partner -- not that the Royal Family should need such a lesson after the PR disaster that was the marriage of Harry's parents.\n\nStill, on today of all days, any nagging anxieties are best forgotten.\n\nThere is no doubt, after all, that the union of Harry and Meghan is a genuine love match, which is not something that can be said for most of their royal predecessors.\n\nYou would, I think, have to be peculiarly mean-spirited -- or a senior member of Jeremy Corbyn's cult -- to deny that the happy pair make an attractive couple, and that there is a palpable spark between them.\n\nPerhaps this explains why the wedding has struck such a chord, not just here, but around the world. As publishers, music producers and film moguls will tell you, romance never goes out of fashion. There is also, of course, the novelty factor.\n\nWe are accustomed to seeing members of the Royal Family at the altar with specimens of the English upper classes. Even the Duchess of Cambridge -- despite the jokes about 'doors to manual', a reference to her mother's past career as an air stewardess -- went to the impeccably blue chip Marlborough College and University of St Andrews.\n\nBut Meghan is different.\n\nNo casting director could have dared to supply the Palace with such a refreshingly original cast member, an American actress with a mixed-race heritage and more than a dash of star quality.\n\nIn the murkier corners of the Left, whose inmates usually foam with rage at the very mention of the monarchy, Meghan's racial identity has provoked all sorts of strange effusions.\n\nSelf-styled republicans hate the Royal Family, but they also claim to love 'diversity', which has left them in something of a fix.\n\nI have to confess to rather enjoying the spectacle of the Guardian newspaper's madder columnists banging out some absolute drivel about how 'the very concept of the Royal Family is the antithesis of diversity', and how Harry is about to get a 'crash course' in the 'complex world of race and identity'.\n\nI bet Meghan didn't mention that on their first date. To the vast majority of sane, normal people, however, the remarkable thing about Ms Markle's background is how unremarkable it is.\n\nA fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding\n\nAlthough we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and 'diversity', especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen's grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.\n\nIronically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.\n\nIn this respect, one family -- the Windsors -- is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.\n\nThe nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.\n\nFew people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.\n\nIndeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare's Prince Hal -- the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt -- he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.\n\nHarry's is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.\n\nIndeed, I suspect that Harry's spectacular public approval ratings -- one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view -- reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother's coffin.\n\nNo politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm's sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.\n\nTwenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.\n\nAt a time when the world's most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me.\n\nAfter all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth.\n\nEven France's President Emmanuel Macron -- a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one -- once remarked that his countrymen are 'eternally nostalgic' for their lost kings. 'The French elect their president to be a monarch,' he said. 'Then they want to cut his head off.'\n\nIn Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.\n\nCynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.\n\nBut this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.\n\nBut the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself -- which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled 'citizens of nowhere' who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.\n\nIts magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.\n\nThe real magic lies in the blend of the national and the individual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.\n\nOf course, the hard-Left can never understand this.\n\nTheir minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.\n\nWell, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.\n\nFor although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.\n\nSo let's hope today's happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.\n\nAnd, if you'll forgive the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, let's hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII.", "Just imagine that somebody told you that men and women are biologically different, that people ought to take responsibility for their own lives, and modern life often seems hollow and meaningless.\n\nImagine that this person went on to say that young men often lack a sense of initiative, too many university courses have fallen victim to trendy dogmas, and free speech sometimes means telling people what they don't want to hear.\n\nWould you shudder in horror? Would you rush onto social media to condemn him as a dangerous lunatic? Or would you, perhaps, nod in agreement at what seemed like plain common-sense?\n\nJordan Peterson, left, was frilled for 30 minutes by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 last month\n\nOnly a few years ago, sentiments like these would have seemed utterly uncontroversial. But it is, I think, a damning reflection of the hysterical self-righteousness and blind intolerance of our times that the man making these arguments, the academic Jordan Peterson, is now one of the most controversial figures in the English-speaking world.\n\nA clinical psychologist at the University of Toronto, Peterson is the academic equivalent of a rock star. Millions of people have watched his YouTube lectures about everything from the importance of free speech to the deeper meaning of the Book Of Genesis.\n\nMore from Dominic Sandbrook for the Daily Mail...

And in the U.S. and his native Canada, his book 12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos, a blend of philosophy, psychology and self-help, is a No 1 Amazon best-seller.\n\nYet in Britain, Peterson is something of an unknown to the wider public -- or, at least, he was. Then, last month when visiting London to promote his book, he was interviewed on Channel 4 News by Cathy Newman.\n\nTheir acrimonious half-hour exchange, which ignited a firestorm of accusations and abuse, has already been watched almost 5.5 million times online.\n\nEven now people are still arguing about it. Newman's producer claims he had to call in security consultants after vile threats from her online critics.\n\nI'll come back to the interview later, because it is worth emphasising that Peterson did not arrive in the television studio without considerable baggage.\n\nUntil two years ago, the 55-year-old Canadian was simply a saturnine, clever and intense man who taught psychology in Toronto. But then, in the autumn of 2016, Peterson released a video announcing his opposition to an amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act, designed to protect people's human right to 'gender expression and identity'.\n\nPeterson was having none of it. He was horrified, he said, that the Bill would turn him into a criminal if he refused to call a transgender student by whatever pronoun they wanted.\n\nBizarre as it may sound, transgender activists in many North American universities insist that their tutors use the invented words 'zhe' and 'zher' rather than 'he' or 'she' and 'his' or 'her'. (I promise I am not making this up.)\n\nAlmost uniquely among his academic peers, Peterson had the backbone to say no.\n\nThe Canadian academic is deemed controversial now because of his views on gender identity\n\n'I will never use words I hate, like the trendy and artificially constructed words \"zhe\" and \"zher\",' he explained. 'These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical Leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.'\n\nThat last line is perhaps a bit strong. Indeed, it is safe to say Peterson is never shy of going over the top.\n\nYet although he is understandably scathing about the more lurid claims of some activists -- who believe, for example, that gender is entirely 'socially constructed' and has nothing to do with human biology -- his real objection was not to transgender people themselves.\n\nWhat outraged him was the thought of being forced to use certain words by the State. For, as he pointed out, there could hardly be a more flagrant example of dogmatic authoritarianism hiding behind a mask of liberal tolerance. To the trendy Left and his politically correct colleagues, Peterson immediately became a hate figure. Almost unbelievably, a young tutor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Canada, was even disciplined, just for showing students a clip of Peterson speaking.\n\nTo young people on the Right, however, Peterson has acquired hero status. When he toured Britain last month to promote his book, his appearances drew packed houses.\n\nAfter he spoke at the Emmanuel Centre in London, the Spectator magazine's Douglas Murray wrote that there were so many people, mostly young, that many had to stand at the back.\n\nChannel 4 presenter Cathy Newman, pictured, is a darling of the highbrow Left\n\n'For an hour and a half,' Murray reported, 'the audience listened to a rambling, quirky but fascinating tour of evolutionary biology, myth, religion, psychology, dictators and Dostoyevsky.'\n\nMany were evidently beside themselves with excitement, with hundreds queuing to get books signed.\n\n'At one point, overwhelmed by the response of the audience and its ecstatic reaction to him and his wife,' noted Murray, Peterson even 'broke into tears' -- a pretty extraordinary way for an academic to behave at a public lecture.\n\nYet the remarkable thing is that, far from being mind-blowing innovations, Peterson's 'rules for life' could hardly be more old-fashioned.\n\nWhen you strip away some of the scientific jargon, some of them -- 'Stand up straight with your shoulders back', for example -- sound like the sort of thing headmasters used to say.\n\nAddressing one of his favourite subjects, the weakness of modern parenting, Peterson is memorably scathing.\n\n'More often than not,' he remarks, 'modern parents are simply paralysed by the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their children if they chastise them for any reason.'\n\nChildren, he says, need not just love and support, but limits and discipline. (Who could argue with that?) But many children have a mother who 'ties their shoes, and cuts up their food, and lets them crawl into bed with her and her partner far too often'.\n\nHe imagines the mother telling her child: 'Never leave me. In return, I will do everything for you. As you age without maturing, you will become worthless and bitter, but you will never have to take any responsibility and everything will always be someone else's fault.'\n\nAs so often, Peterson exaggerates, but you can see what he means.\n\nAfter all, isn't one of the defining features of the Snowflake Generation their unshakeable belief that everything is always someone else's fault?\n\nBy contrast, Peterson wants us to embrace the two things that many liberal parents (and their children) most abhor: risk and responsibility.\n\nBy his own account, he once worked as a 'dishwasher, gas jockey, bartender, short-order cook, beekeeper, oil derrick bit re-tipper, plywood mill labourer and railway line worker'.\n\nSo, in his case, you can forget the stereotype of the weedy, spineless, denatured academic. In many ways, in fact, his philosophy boils down to old-fashioned rugged individualism, forged in the freezing wastes of Alberta, Canada.\n\nTime and again, he emphasises the importance of individual responsibility -- an extraordinarily refreshing thing to hear at a time when most intellectuals regard individualism as a dirty word.\n\nBy contrast, he loathes the whingeing, whining identity politics that have become so prevalent in universities across the Western world, with self-righteous students competing to pose as victims of every conceivable kind of prejudice.\n\nPeterson's favourite target, though, is fellow academics, whom he regards as feckless, incompetent, cowardly, deluded and narrow-minded fanatics, in thrall to an unholy blend of Marxism, post-modernism and radical feminism. In an interview with the British novelist Tim Lott, he suggested that 'the humanities in the universities have become almost incomprehensibly shallow and corrupt in multiple ways'.\n\nThere are, he says, 'whole disciplines in universities forthrightly hostile towards men. These are the areas of study, dominated by the post-modern/neo-Marxist claim that western culture, in particular, is an oppressive structure, created by white men to dominate and exclude women.'\n\nThose who seek to silence Jordan Peterson, by denying him a platform or caricaturing him as a professional controversialist, are betraying the very liberal values they claim to uphold\n\nAs a result, 'at this rate there will be very few men in most university disciplines in 15 years'.\n\nAgain, this is a bit overstated. Even so, Peterson's appeal to young men is genuinely extraordinary. Clearly many young men feel he gives them a sense of meaning, inspiration and encouragement unmatched by any other modern thinker.\n\nSome of it is attributable to his great personal intensity -- the burning eyes, the furrowed brow -- but it strikes me that Peterson is a distinctly religious figure, a modern version of an Old Testament prophet or an evangelical preacher.\n\nHe believes in God. He talks about the story of Cain and Abel and the suffering of Jesus. He believes in Hell, the 'barren, hopeless and malevolent subdivision of the underworld of chaos'.\n\nHe writes movingly about the suffering of his daughter, who grew up with severe rheumatoid arthritis, and asks how God could allow such a thing to happen. And he reflects on the terrible cruelty that men inflicted on one another in the last century.\n\n'We are all monsters,' he told Lott, 'and if you don't know that, then you are in danger of becoming the very monster that you deny.'\n\nAs I said, all this is strong stuff. But it is serious stuff, too, the kind of thing that invites debate, and that will have people arguing for hours on end.\n\nAlas, to the bien-pensant Left, all this is simply heresy. Instead of running the risk of being made to think, they would prefer not to listen at all.\n\nThe irony is that in some ways Peterson is not especially Right-wing; he supports the liberalisation of the drug laws and state health care, and defines himself as an old-fashioned British liberal.\n\nYet in self-consciously high-minded circles in his native Canada, he has become persona non grata. And now in Britain, too.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper ran a remarkably contemptuous review of his book, complete with a dark warning about his 'reputation in conservative circles'. And then there was that highly-charged Channel 4 News with Cathy Newman, a darling of the highbrow Left.\n\nTheir half-hour exchange about -- among other things -- the gender pay gap, transgender rights, and the right of speakers to cause offence, can still be caught on YouTube. Watch it, and make up your own mind.\n\nFor my part, I thought it was a pretty good fight -- and one Peterson clearly won. And yes, Newman tried to put words in his mouth, twist, exaggerate and over-simplify what he was saying, and generally bombard him with non-sequiturs -- but don't interviewers do that to everybody?\n\nIn any case, Peterson beat her back with a devastating blend of politeness and erudition; indeed, at one point he even reduced her to a long, spluttering pause.\n\nWhat I think is most revealing, though, is the sheer intensity, and even outright abusiveness, of the online exchanges between Peterson's critics and admirers -- some of whom, unforgivably, directed vile, sexist abuse at Cathy Newman.\n\nBut this, I fear, is the inevitable result of a culture where some things are supposedly 'unsayable', where strident hysteria replaces rational thought, and where self-appointed thought police are continually on the lookout for those who challenge their pet prejudices.\n\nAs it happens, I agree with much of what Peterson says. I think he is right that gender is largely determined by our biology. I agree that liberalism has become disturbingly authoritarian.\n\nI agree that people should take responsibility for their own lives, instead of constantly blaming society. And I certainly agree that university life, both here and abroad, is threatened by a rising tide of cant, conformity, jargon and intolerance.\n\nBut if there is one thing, above all, that marks Peterson out as a prophet for our times, it is his belief that free speech is sacred.\n\nSad to say, we live in an age when those who question the dogmas of the day are too often shouted down and cast out.\n\nThose who seek to silence Jordan Peterson, by denying him a platform or caricaturing him as a professional controversialist, are betraying the very liberal values they claim to uphold. I don't say that he's right about everything, but he's right about a lot of things.\n\nIf his liberal critics stopped screaming for a moment and bothered to listen, I suspect they might even find themselves agreeing with one or two of his opinions.\n\nBut that would mean agreeing with a conservative. And in today's climate of intolerance, bigotry, conformism and hysteria, that, of course, would never do.", "To most people, the Oscar-nominated films Dunkirk and Darkest Hour are a stirring reminder of the sacrifices that, in the summer of 1940, so many young men made for our freedom.\n\nBut the German ambassador, Dr Peter Ammon, is clearly not a fan. Reflecting on what he called the tale of 'how Britain stood alone in the war, how it stood against dominating Germany', he told the Guardian newspaper yesterday that it might be 'a nice story, but does not solve any problem of today'.\n\nDr Ammon's grasp of current affairs is clearly questionable, since he also described the perception that Germany dominates the EU (which it patently does) as 'a horrible story'.\n\nGerman ambassador, Dr Peter Ammon, said the story of how Britain stood alone in the war might be 'a nice story, but does not solve any problem of today'.\n\nYet he is far from alone in his apparent belief that Britain's supposedly unhealthy obsession with World War II led, inevitably, to Brexit.\n\n'Britain has built a national myth on winning the Second World War, but it's distorting our politics,' read a headline in the Left-wing New Statesman a few months ago.\n\n'Dunkirk and Darkest Hour fuel Brexit fantasies,' howled the Guardian.\n\nThat Dr Ammon is sensitive about the war is understandable enough. But for British commentators to carry on as if our history should be a source of embarrassment strikes me as pretty disgraceful.\n\nIndeed, I sometimes wonder whether they would prefer us to have been defeated and occupied. Perhaps they think that would have been a price worth paying, if it meant unquestioning enthusiasm for the European project.\n\nYou might assume all this began with the vote to leave the EU, which provoked a colossal and apparently interminable tantrum from the ultra-Remainers.\n\nYet as long as ago as 2002, a certain Nick Clegg -- who, as you may recall, briefly pursued a career in politics -- claimed that Britain had been permanently disfigured by winning World War II.\n\nAt the time, Mr Clegg, a member of the European Parliament, was deeply displeased that Britain had refused to embrace the euro. And his view perfectly captures the more hysterical Remainers' current attitude to their own country's history.\n\n'All nations have a cross to bear, and none more so than Germany with its memories of Nazism,' he wrote. 'But the British cross is more insidious still.\n\n'A misplaced sense of superiority, sustained by delusions of grandeur and a tenacious obsession with the last war, is much harder to shake off. We need to be put back in our place.'\n\nAs anyone who listens to the Euro-enthusiasts will know, this is a very familiar argument. But I doubt I am alone in finding it not merely offensive but fantastically foolish.\n\nMore from Dominic Sandbrook for the Daily Mail...

We've forgotten the lessons of history! 22/01/18 VIEW FULL ARCHIVE\n\nTo begin with, the plain fact is that just as we are all the sum of our memories, so all nations are the products of their histories. Indeed, there is surely a case that what really defines a nation is a shared story about its past.\n\nWhether the German ambassador and Mr Clegg like it or not, Britain's story is different from those of our neighbours.\n\nNo other country in Europe fought both world wars without suffering defeat or occupation.\n\nIndeed, no other major European country went through the 20th century without experiencing occupation, revolution or civil war.\n\nThat fact alone surely explains why Britain was never wholly converted to the cause of European union, and why millions voted to leave.\n\nArch-Remainers find this immensely infuriating. Since they cannot rewrite our history, they would prefer people to forget about it. And whenever you mention it, they fume with indignation and mutter darkly about Britain's supposed obsession with D-Day and Dunkirk.\n\nYet in our relationship with our history, we in Britain are no different from anybody else in Europe.\n\nDo the French not tell stories about Joan of Arc, Napoleon and the Resistance? Do the Irish not celebrate the Easter Rising? Do German schoolchildren not learn about their nation's past?\n\nAh, say the self-styled citizens of the world, but the Germans regard their own history with sorrow and humility. By contrast, we are puffed up -- as Mr Clegg put it -- with 'delusions of grandeur'.\n\nThis, too, strikes me as utter rubbish. How many British teachers today fill their pupils with swaggering dreams of imperial glory? The answer, I suspect, is none at all\n\nAs for films such as Dunkirk and Darkest Hour, only somebody who watched them wearing a blindfold and earplugs could imagine they promote 'delusions of grandeur'.\n\nThe German ambassador is 'clearly not a fan' of films such as the Oscar-nominated films Dunkirk (picture) and Darkest Hour which are a reminder of the sacrifices that so many young men made for our freedom.\n\nDunkirk, for example, is a film about a defeat, not a victory. Indeed, its director, Christopher Nolan, has adamantly denied any links with Brexit. As he put it: 'Interpreting the events of 1940 through a modern lens is frankly disrespectful to the people who lived through the real-life events . . . Brexit happened while we were shooting and was as much a surprise to us as to everybody else.'\n\nAnd as for the director of Darkest Hour, Joe Wright, he is about as far from being a passionate Leaver as you could imagine, since he described Brexit as 'dreadful'.\n\nIt is true that stories about the world wars continue to fascinate audiences. Once again, though, it is simply not the case that we in Britain are unusually obsessed with the conflicts of the last century.\n\nIt was the Americans, not us, who made Saving Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers. The hugely acclaimed Downfall, about the last days inside Hitler's bunker, was a German, Italian and Austrian co-production. And the international best-seller Suite Francaise, about the Nazi occupation of France, was first published in Paris.\n\nIn any case, why wouldn't we care about the world wars?\n\nThey were, after all, the most apocalyptic, searing and influential events of modern times, not just here in Britain, but in every corner of the earth.\n\nThere are more than 70,000 war memorials across our islands, carrying the names of the men who fought for our freedom. There are still hundreds of elderly men who remember running ashore on the Normandy beaches, streaking through the sky in the Battle of Britain or ploughing through the seas on a battleship. And there are still countless men and women who lost parents or grandparents in the struggles against Kaiser Wilhelm II and then Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe irony is if there is one nation that has an exemplary record of remembering the war, it is Germany, which has vowed never to repeat it.\n\nAfter Britain refused to join the Euro Nick Clegg claimed that Britain had been permanently disfigured by winning World War II.\n\nIndeed, there is surely a case that it is the power-houses of the EU, not Britain, that really betray an obsession with the world wars.\n\nThe entire European project was designed in the early Fifties to prevent France and Germany from ever going to war again.\n\nAs the German ambassador surely knows, the opening paragraphs of its founding document, the Schuman Declaration of 1950, specifically cite the war, promising 'the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany'.\n\nGiven what the French and Germans had been through a decade earlier, it is hardly surprising that the EU's architects were obsessed with the war. The remarkable thing, though, is just how long that obsession has endured.\n\nWhen, four years ago, Angela Merkel addressed the Houses of Parliament, she described the EU as a 'peace mission', designed to end 'the recurring rounds of horrendous bloodshed'.\n\nAnd during the Greek bailout crisis, she even told Germany's parliamentarians that saving the euro was the only way to ensure 'another half century of peace in Europe' -- the implication being that without it, we would find ourselves back in 1939.\n\nIt would be absurd to expect the Germans to forget the history of the 20th century.\n\nBut it would be equally ridiculous, and indeed insulting, to expect us in Britain to forget it either.\n\nAnd if we have drawn different lessons from Mrs Merkel -- well, is that really so surprising? The war was the foundational moment of our modern experience. It shaped our politics, our economy, our moral outlook and our shared national identity.\n\nNever in human history has any event reached such extremes of heroism and courage, suffering and sacrifice.\n\nDon't mention the war, they say. But why on earth not?", "As my colleague Hamilton Nolan has astutely noted, the public dog is the greatest dog. It is a dog that you do not have to take to the vet or bathe or feed, but nonetheless a dog whose cuteness you can enjoy.\n\nUnfortunately, not everybody shares this appreciation for a dog livin' his best life in the world. The New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority, known to locals as the MTA, is anti-dog. Here was its response to a dog tweet from Gothamist's Jen Chung:\n\nAs she pointed out in a later tweet, Chung wasn't actually trying to narc on the dog, merely noting the dog's existence. Yet the MTA interpreted this as a complaint, and advised her to CALL THE FUCKING COPS if she sees another dog in future. Imagine being that person. \"Hello, 911, there is a dog on the train. No, it's not hurting anyone; it hasn't taken the train hostage; it isn't driving the train. It is simply being dog and I am livid.\"\n\nImagine, too, being the person who answers that 911 call and has to begrudgingly dispatch a police officer to deal with the dog -- because, as the MTA pointed out in a subsequent tweet, it is in fact illegal to have a heckin' lorge doggo on the train:\n\nThe New York subway actually bans dogs that cannot fit in a bag, which has led to many extremely good pictures of dogs that are too big to be in a bag!! But they're in a bag anyway!! Ahh!!!\n\nLook, Mr. or Ms. NYCT Subway, you may be technically right that it's illegal to let dog on train. But you undoubtedly have many thousands of Twitter mentions to respond to, and yet you chose this. Why? Why. Why own yourself in this manner? Why choose to endorse the extension of the fascist police state to dog policing? Why do you hate dogs? Why do you hate fun?\n\nIt should also be noted that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo controls the MTA. That's right: Andrew Cuomo has not only let the MTA fall into disrepair and chaos, he also has let it become a totalitarian anti-dog state. For shame, governor.\n\nThe MTA can surely reach past its prejudice and agree with dogs on at least one thing: If you see something, bark bark.", "Last month, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), Chairman of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee held an important hearing on \"War Powers and the Effects of Unauthorized Military Engagements on Federal Spending.\"\n\nThe hearing examined the costs (both financial and to our constitutional system) of the last three presidents' use of the 2001 Authorization of Military Force, which granted the president limited powers to use force to go after those involved in the 9-11 attacks. It's been used to justify endless war-making and assaults on civil liberties. The hearing also examined the flaws with the \"replacement\" Authorization of Military Force proposed by Senators Bob Corker (R-TN) and Tim Kaine (D-VA).\n\nOver the next few weeks, I will be posting written testimony from the hearing, starting with Judge Napolitano's.\n\nWar and the Separation of Powers: War Powers and the Effects of Unauthorized Engagements on Federal Spending\n\nTestimony before the Federal Spending Oversight Subcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\nUnited States Senate\n\nJune 6, 2018\n\nIt is an honor to appear before you today in this chamber.\n\nThe issue before this body relates to a matter far more serious, and far more troubling than I would hope the Congress would ever need to confront. The fact that such legislation can even be considered by this Congress speaks volumes about the state of our Republic.\n\nS.J. Res 59 of the 115th Congress threatens to extinguish the firewalls carefully erected by our Founders by delegating to the Executive Branch the power to make limitless war on a poorly defined enemy without any clear objective or end point. The separation of powers was designed, as James Madison reminds us in Federalist 51, with the belief that \"mbition must be made to counteract ambition.\" (THE FEDERALIST NO. 51 (J. Madison))\n\nMany American law schools begin classes in Constitutional Law by asking students what sets the U.S. Constitution apart from all others. Usually, students focus on free speech, privacy, and, perhaps, due process. While each of these guarantees, when honored, proves vital to restraining government, they would falter without the separation of powers. The constitutions of many totalitarian countries pay lip service to free speech, privacy and even due process; but none has the strict separation of powers that we enjoy here in the United States. Under our Constitution, you, and your Senate colleagues and your counterparts in the House of Representatives, write our laws. The president enforces them, and the courts interpret them; and those powers and functions may not constitutionally be mixed, exchanged, or traded.\n\nThe Congress also declares war. The president also wages war. The courts also invalidate the acts of the other two branches when they exceed their constitutional powers.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the separation of powers is integral to the Constitution not to preserve the prerogatives of each branch of government, but to divide governmental powers among the branches so as to keep power diffused -- and thereby limited and thus protective of personal freedom.\n\nJames Madison, who wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, wanted not only this diffusion by separation but also tension -- even jealousy -- among the branches so as to keep each in check. He believed that \"he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, , or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\"(THE FEDERALIST NO. 47 (J. Madison))\n\nAnd it was in the same essay that James Madison stated, referring to the separation of powers, that \"o political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value, or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty.\"(THE FEDERALIST NO. 47 (J. Madison)) As a legislator, Madison repeated, as quoted by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, that: \"If there is a principle in our Constitution, indeed in any free Constitution, more sacred than another, it is that which separates the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers. If there is any point in which the separation of the Legislative and Executive powers ought to be maintained with great caution, it is that which relates to officers and offices.\" (Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 116 (1926) (Taft, C.J) quoting 1 Annals of Cong. 581 (Statement of Rep. Madison).)\n\nSeparation of powers weighed heavily on the minds of the Framers of the Constitution. Indeed, as my dear friend, the late Justice Antonin Scalia observed while he sat on the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \"no less than five of the Federalist Papers were devoted to the demonstration that the principle was adequately observed in the proposed constitution.\"\n\nThe Framers never imagined that one branch of government would abdicate its authority and cede an essential power to another branch since such a giveaway would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the core functions of each branch of the federal government may not be delegated away to either of the other two without violating the separation of powers.\n\nI recount this not as a mini-constitutional law history lesson but rather because it serves as necessary background to address a real and contemporary problem. In mid-April of this year, on the basis of evidence so flimsy that his own secretary of defense questioned it -- and without any legal or constitutional authority -- President Donald Trump dispatched 110 missiles to bomb certain military and civilian targets in Syria, where the President argued the Syrian government manufactured, stored, or used chemical weapons.\n\nPresident Trump did not appeal to you for a declaration of war, nor did he comply with the U.N. Charter, a treaty to which both the U.S. and Syria are signatories. Though he did not articulate any statutory basis for his use of our military, his predecessors often based their unconstitutional uses of military force two statutes -- one enacted in 2001 and the other in 2002, each known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF.\n\nThe AUMFs refer to either the Taliban or al-Qaida or their affiliated forces in Afghanistan or Iraq as targets, or to pursuing those who caused the attacks in America on 9/11 or those who harbor weapons of mass destruction. They are grievously outdated and inapplicable today.\n\nCan a president legally use military force to attack a foreign land without a serious threat or legal obligation or a declaration of war from Congress? In a word: No. The President has never had that authority.\n\nThe Constitution is clear that only Congress can declare war, and only the president can wage it. Federal law and international treaties provide that -- short of defending the country against an actual attack -- without a congressional declaration of war, the president can only constitutionally use military force to repel an enemy whose attack on America is imminent or to defend U.S. citizens and property in foreign lands from foreign attack or in aid of an ally pursuant to a treaty with that ally.\n\nIn the case of the President's bombing of Syria in April, none of those conditions was met.\n\nPrior to the strike on Syria -- but no doubt prodded by the prospect of it -- a bipartisan group of your Senate colleagues offered legislation supported by the President that you are considering today. If enacted it would rescind both anachronistic AUMFs, which possess no useful moral or legal authority, in favor of an unconstitutional mishmash that would permit a president to strike whomever and wherever he pleases. The president would be restrained only by a vote of Congress -- after hostilities have commenced.\n\nThe legislation under scrutiny today would give the president far more powers than he has now, would directly violate Congress' war-making powers by ceding them away to the president, would defy the Supreme Court on the unconstitutionality of giving away core governmental functions, would commit the U.S. to foreign wars without congressional and thus popular support, and would invite dangerous mischief by any president wanting to attack any enemy -- real or imagined, old or new -- for foreign or domestic political purposes, whether American interests are at stake or not.\n\nSpeaking of the Supreme Court's approval of internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, Justice Robert Jackson warned that such approval by the Court of expansive executive authority \"lies about like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.\"\n\nThe proponents of this legislation will argue that Congress would retain its war-making powers by its ability to restrain the president through some future action. That is a naive contention because congressional restraint, which can come only in the form of prohibitory legislation or withdrawal of funds, would certainly be met by a presidential veto -- and a veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate.\n\nThe Constitution, written in war's aftermath, strictly limits war's offensive use only to when the people's representatives in Congress have recognized a broad national consensus behind it.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams, in his July 4, 1821 address, cautioned that America \"goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.\"\n\nI could go on to explain the significance of the placement of the war power in the hands of Congress. I could also speak to the violations of our civil liberties and natural rights at the hands of the executive in times of war. However, 225 years ago, James Madison foresaw these dangers. Between 1793 and 1794, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton debated the roles of the executive and legislative branches after President George Washington had declared that the United States would remain neutral in the war etween Revolutionary France and Great Britain. James Madison delivered an explanation of the importance the war power as congressional prerogative as elegant and precise as the Constitution itself.\n\nHe wrote this a scant ten years after the formal conclusion of the American Revolution. At that time, Congress met in Congress Hall in Philadelphia. John Jay still presided as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, which also met in Philadelphia. Though our Republic remained in it infancy, James Madison understood the risks that wars presented to the United States. He wrote:\n\nIn no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department. Beside the objection to such a mixture to heterogeneous powers, the trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man; not such as nature may offer as the prodigy of many centuries, but such as may be expected in the ordinary successions of magistracy. War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement. In war, a physical force is to be created; and it is the executive will, which is to direct it. In war, the public treasures are to be unlocked; and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them. In war, the honours and emoluments of office are to be multiplied; and it is the executive patronage under which they are to be enjoyed. It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be gathered, and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honourable or venial love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace.\n\nThank you, for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to your questions.", "\"A good society contains many different artists doing many different things. A bad society coerces artists because it knows that they can reveal all kinds of truths.\"\n\n\"One of the functions of art,\" Ursula K. Le Guin observed in contemplating art, storytelling, and the power of language to transform and redeem, \"is to give people the words to know their own experience... Storytelling is a tool for knowing who we are and what we want.\" Because self-knowledge is the most difficult of the arts of living, because understanding ourselves is a prerequisite for understanding anybody else, and because we can hardly fathom the reality of another without first plumbing our own depths, art is what makes us not only human but humane.\n\nThat is what the philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch (July 15, 1919-February 8, 1999) -- one of the most lucid and luminous minds of the twentieth century -- explored in a long, deep, immensely insightful 1977 conversation with the British broadcaster and philosopher Bryan McGee, which aired on McGee's television series Men of Ideas. (That, after all, was the era when every woman was \"man.\") The transcript was later adapted and published in the altogether revelatory collection of Murdoch's essays and interviews, Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature (public library).\n\nMurdoch begins by reflecting on the fundamental difference between the function of philosophy and that of art -- one being to clarify and concretize, the other to mystify and expand. She observes:\n\nLiterary writing is an art, an aspect of an art form. It may be self-effacing or it may be grand, but if it is literature it has an artful intention, the language is being used in a characteristically elaborate manner in relation to the \"work,\" long or short, of which it forms a part. So there is not one literary style or ideal literary style, though of course there is good and bad writing.\n\nA century after Nietzsche examined the power of language to both conceal and reveal truth, and several years before Oliver Sacks's trailblazing insight into narrative as the pillar of identity, Murdoch considers how we, as storytelling creatures, use language in the parallel arts of literature and living:\n\nLiterary modes are very natural to us, very close to ordinary life and to the way we live as reflective beings. Not all literature is fiction, but the greater part of it is or involves fiction, invention, masks, playing roles, pretending, imagining, story-telling. When we return home and \"tell our day,\" we are artfully shaping material into story form. (These stories are very often funny, incidentally.) So in a way as word-users we all exist in a literary atmosphere, we live and breathe literature, we are all literary artists, we are constantly employing language to make interesting forms out of experience which perhaps originally seemed dull or incoherent. How far reshaping involves offences against truth is a problem any artist must face. A deep motive for making literature or art of any sort is the desire to defeat the formlessness of the world and cheer oneself up by constructing forms out of what might otherwise seem a mass of senseless rubble.\n\nEchoing Hemingway's admonition against the dangers of ego in creative work, Murdoch cautions:\n\nWe want a writer to write well and to have something interesting to say. Perhaps we should distinguish a recognisable style from a personal presence. Shakespeare has a recognisable style but no presence, whereas a writer like D. H. Lawrence has a less evident style but a strong presence. Though many poets and some novelists speak to us in a highly personal manner, much of the best literature has no strongly felt presence of the author in the work. A literary presence if it is too bossy, like Lawrence's, may be damaging; when for instance one favoured character is the author's spokesman. Bad writing is almost always full of the fumes of personality.\n\nIn a sentiment bridging William James's landmark assertion that \"a purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity\" and Tolstoy's insistence that \"emotional infectiousness\" is what separates good art from the bad, Murdoch considers the central animating force of art:\n\nLiterature could be called a disciplined technique for arousing certain emotions. (Of course there are other such techniques.) I would include the arousing of emotion in the definition of art, although not every occasion of experiencing art is an emotional occasion. The sensuous nature of art is involved here, the fact that it is concerned with visual and auditory sensations and bodily sensations. If nothing sensuous is present no art is present. This fact alone makes it quite different from \"theoretical\" activities... Art is close dangerous play with unconscious forces. We enjoy art, even simple art, because it disturbs us in deep often incomprehensible ways; and this is one reason why it is good for us when it is good and bad for us when it is bad.\n\nExpanding upon the ideas of the ancient Greeks, so formative to our understanding of art, Murdoch offers a definition:\n\nArt is mimesis and good art is, to use another Platonic term, anamnesis, \"memory\" of what we did not know we knew... Art \"holds the mirror up to nature.\" Of course this reflection or \"imitation\"\" does not mean slavish or photographic copying. But it is important to hold on to the idea that art is about the world, it exists for us standing out against a background of our ordinary knowledge. Art may extend this knowledge but is also tested by it.\n\nShe considers the ecosystem of good and bad art in human culture, and the essential distinguishing factor between the two:\n\nThere is always more bad art around than good art, and more people like bad art than like good art.\n\n[...]\n\nGood art is good for people precisely because it is not fantasy but imagination. It breaks the grip of our own dull fantasy life and stirs us to the effort of true vision. Most of the time we fail to see the big wide real world at all because we are blinded by obsession, anxiety, envy, resentment, fear. We make a small personal world in which we remain enclosed. Great art is liberating, it enables us to see and take pleasure in what is not ourselves. Literature stirs and satisfies our curiosity, it interests us in other people and other scenes, and helps us to be tolerant and generous. Art is informative. And even mediocre art can tell us something, for instance about how other people live. But to say this is not to hold a utilitarian or didactic view of art. Art is larger than such narrow ideas.\n\nA decade after James Baldwin wielded the double-edged sword of the artist's duty to society, Murdoch insists on this largeness:\n\nI certainly do not believe that it is the artist's task to serve society.\n\n[...]\n\nA citizen has a duty to society, and a writer might sometimes feel he ought to write persuasive newspaper articles or pamphlets, but this would be a different activity. The artist's duty is to art, to truth-telling in his own medium, the writer's duty is to produce the best literary work of which he is capable, and he must find out how this can be done.\n\nIn consonance with John F. Kennedy's exhortation to a propaganda-smothered society -- \"We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth.\" -- Murdoch considers the deeper reality beneath what may appear as an artificial distinction between artist and citizen:\n\nA propaganda play which is indifferent to art is likely to be a misleading statement even if it is inspired by good principles. If serious art is a primary aim then some sort of justice is a primary aim. A social theme presented as art is likely to be more clarified even if it is less immediately persuasive. And any artist may serve his society incidentally by revealing things which people have not noticed or understood. Imagination reveals, it explains. This is part of what is meant by saying that art is mimesis. Any society contains propaganda, but it is important to distinguish this from art and to preserve the purity and independence of the practice of art. A good society contains many different artists doing many different things. A bad society coerces artists because it knows that they can reveal all kinds of truths.\n\nThree decades after the teenage Sylvia Plath precociously observed that \"once a poem is made available to the public, the right of interpretation belongs to the reader,\" Murdoch examines the laboratory for reflection and interpretation that great art constructs in its pursuit of truth:\n\nA poem, play or novel usually appears as a closed pattern. But it is also open in so far as it refers to a reality beyond itself, and such a reference raises... questions about truth... Art is truth as well as form, it is representational as well as autonomous. Of course the communication may be indirect, but the ambiguity of the great writer creates spaces which we can explore and enjoy because they are openings on to the real world and not formal language games or narrow crevices of personal fantasy; and we do not get tired of great writers, because what is true is interesting... Any serious artist has a sense of distance between himself and something quite other in relation to which he feels humility since he knows that it is far more detailed and wonderful and awful and amazing than anything which he can ever express. This \"other\" is most readily called \"reality\" or \"nature\" or \"the world\" and this is a way of talking that one must not give up.\n\nMurdoch holds good criticism -- the formal interpretation of art -- to the same standard as good art:\n\nBeauty in art is the formal imaginative exhibition of something true, and criticism must remain free to work at a level where it can judge truth in art... Training in an art is largely training in how to discover a touchstone of truth; and there is an analogous training in criticism.\n\nIn a passage that calls to mind Susan Sontag's beautiful wisdom on storytelling and what it means to be a moral human being, Murdoch weighs the relationship between morality and truth, as mediated by language:\n\nIt is important to remember that language itself is a moral medium, almost all uses of language convey value. This is one reason why we are almost always morally active. Life is soaked in the moral, literature is soaked in the moral. If we attempted to describe this room our descriptions would naturally carry all sorts of values. Value is only artificially and with difficulty expelled from language for scientific purposes. So the novelist is revealing his values by any sort of writing which he may do. He is particularly bound to make moral judgements in so far as his subject matter is the behaviour of human beings... The author's moral judgement is the air which the reader breathes.\n\nThe extent to which the writer is a seer and channeler of truth, Murdoch argues, is the measure of his or her writing:\n\nOne can see here very clearly the contrast between blind fantasy and visionary imagination. The bad writer gives way to personal obsession and exalts some characters and demeans others without any concern for truth or justice, that is without any suitable aesthetic 'explanation'. It is clear here how the idea of reality enters into literary judgement. The good writer is the just, intelligent judge. He justifies his placing of his characters by some sort of work which he does in the book. A literary fault such as sentimentality results from idealisation without work. This work of course may be of different kinds, and all sorts of methods of placing characters, or relation of characters to plot or theme, may produce good art. Criticism is much concerned with the techniques by which this is done. A great writer can combine form and character in a felicitous way (think how Shakespeare does it) so as to produce a large space in which the characters can exist freely and yet at the same time serve the purposes of the tale. A great work of art gives one a sense of space, as if one had been invited into some large hall of reflection.\n\n[...]\n\nArtists are often revolutionary in some sense or other. But the good artist has, I think, a sense of reality and might be said to understand \"how things are\" and why they are... The great artist sees the marvels which selfish anxiety conceals from the rest of us. But what the artist sees is not something separate and special, some metaphysically cut-off never-never land. The artist engages a very large area of his personality in his work...\n\nIn a sentiment that Zadie Smith would come to echo in the tenth of her ten tenets of writing -- \"Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand -- but tell it.\" -- Murdoch adds:\n\nArt is naturally communication (only a perverse ingenuity can attempt to deny this obvious truth) and this involves the joining of the farthest-out reality to what is nearer, as must be done by any truthful explorer... Literature is connected with the way we live. Some philosophers tell us that the self is discontinuous and some writers explore this idea, but the writing (and the philosophy) takes place in a world where we have good reasons for assuming the self to be continuous. Of course this is not a plea for 'realistic' writing. It is to say that the artist cannot avoid the demands of truth, and that his decision about how to tell truth in his art is his most important decision.\n\nA quarter century after Hannah Arendt penned her timeless treatise on how dictatorships use isolation as a weapon of oppression, Murdoch considers this singular virtue of \"merciful objectivity\" at the heart of art -- the selfsame virtue of which totalitarian regimes bereave society by persecuting art and artists. In a parallel to physicist Freeman Dyson's observation that \"the glory of life [is] that it always seems to tend to diversity,\" she argues that what art gives us, above all else, is a warm and welcoming regard for what is other than ourselves:\n\nI would like to say that all great artists are tolerant in their art, but perhaps this cannot be argued. Was Dante tolerant? I think most great writers have a sort of calm merciful vision because they can see how different people are and why they are different. Tolerance is connected with being able to imagine centres of reality which are remote from oneself. There is a breath of tolerance and generosity and intelligent kindness which blows out of Homer and Shakespeare and the great novelists. The great artist sees the vast interesting collection of what is other than himself and does not picture the world in his own image.\n\nMurdoch's Existentialists and Mystics is a trove of abiding insight in its totality -- one of those rare books that illuminate the immense breadth of the human experience while also plumbing its richest depth. Complement this particular portion with Rebecca West on storytelling as a survival mechanism, Pablo Neruda's touching account of what a childhood encounter taught him about why we make art, and Jeanette Winterson on how art redeems our inner lives, then revisit Iris Murdoch on causality, chance, and how love gives meaning to our existence and her devastatingly beautiful love letters.", "Theresa May spoke out against the 'troubling situation in Gaza' and called for an independent investigation into the killing of dozens of Palestinians in the worst clashes in the region for years.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the probe should look into why the Israelis used life fire against Palestinians as they demonstrated near the border.\n\nAnd it should also look into whether the militant group Hamas infiltrated the protests to stoke violence and discord, she said.\n\nShe made the comments at a joint press conference with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who earlier today tore into the US and Israel over the 'horrible massacre'.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Mrs May said: 'The loss of life we have seen is tragic and extremely concerning...it is disruptive to peace efforts and we urge all sides to show restraint.\n\n'There is an urgent need to establish the facts of what happened yesterday by having an independent investigation (which should look at) the use of live fire and the role of Hamas.'\n\nSpeaking in No 10 before the talks, Earlier, Mr Erdogan also spoke out against the violence unleashed yesterday.\n\nTheresa May spoke out against the 'troubling situation in Gaza' and called for an independent investigation into the killing of dozens of Palestinians in the worst clashes in the region for years at a joint press conference today with President Erdogan\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan attacked Israel and the US after dozens of Palestinians - many unarmed - were killed by Israeli sniper fire during protests yesterday and today, as he sat next to Theresa May in Downing Street today (pictured)\n\nTheresa May is meeting with Turkish President Erdogan today where the pair will discuss their partnership on security matters\n\nThe Prime Minister literally rolled out the red carpet for Mr Erdogan's visit to Downing Street today where the pair are having bilateral talks\n\nHe said: 'While we are focusing our talks on the Syria issue, yesterday unfortunately significant incidents have unfolded in Palestine after the US decided to move their embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.\n\n'We are facing significant challenges and there are a lot of martyrs.

Nor is it democratic socialism, the egalitarian platform that many young progressives have embraced since the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nInstead, this movement may well be what some are calling the \"intellectual dark web.\" It is a heterogeneous group, bringing together neuroscientists, biologists, and psychologists with entrepreneurs, comedians, and sports commentators. Some claim to lean to the left, others to the right. There is nonetheless a common enemy that unites them. Despite their various differences, all members of the movement believe their ideas are being stifled by an epidemic of \"political correctness.\"\n\nUnlike the actual \"dark web\" of hidden online networks, this one requires no specialized software to be made accessible. Its ideas can be found in best-selling books and media channels with millions of subscribers. Mathematician and financier Eric Weinstein coined the term intellectual dark web, and he meant to point out not that this group is obscure -- it isn't -- but that its figures all pride themselves on upturning conventional beliefs.\n\nWhat exactly are the ideas that have made people like Weinstein, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Dave Rubin, Ben Shapiro, and Christina Hoff Sommers into what a recent New York Times profile described as intellectual \"renegades\"? According to the Times writer Bari Weiss, most emphasize the biological differences between men and women, a feeling that free speech is \"under siege,\" and a fear that \"identity politics\" is a threat to the United States's social fabric.\n\nA listener of Harris's podcast might add to the list a vociferous defense of the validity of genetic explanations for IQ differences between racial groups, a follower of Peterson's videos might insist on the nefarious influence of \"postmodern neo-Marxism\" on college campuses, and a fan of Ben Shapiro might contribute a skepticism toward the reality of \"transgenderism.\"\n\nThe movement sees itself as an alliance that defies established political categories in order to defend these ideas against the creeping influence of thought control. This leads us to another important meaning of the term intellectual dark web, the suggestion that its ideas are not only controversial, but particularly innovative in our political moment. If the dark web arouses the anger of certain commentators in the media or the academy, it is for the same reasons that new technologies in the internet age are \"disruptive.\"\n\nIt would take a short memory, however, not to notice that these sorts of polemics over political correctness are anything but novel: they have been around for at least 30 years, ever since a strikingly similar set of media debates centered around college campuses took off in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Toward the end of the Reagan years, political correctness became a favorite bugbear of conservative intellectuals, who believed that college professors had latched onto illiberal or totalitarian notions of equality, and were indoctrinating their students with a subversive view of American society. Today's \"dark web\" provocateurs rarely mention these predecessors, who not too long ago occupied a similar place in national media debates. But the comparison suggests that the \"iconoclastic\" ideas of these figures are actually a well-established institution in American discourse: an institution whose home is on the political right.\n\n\u00a4\n\nThe 1980s-1990s political correctness debates were in many respects debates over the legacy of the radical politics and counterculture of the 1960s. Allan Bloom kicked things off with his 1987 best seller The Closing of the American Mind, which argued that the influence of '60s-era student, feminist, and Black Power movements led college students to reject traditional liberal arts curricula. Roger Kimball later upped the ante, alleging that the professors of the 1980s were former student protesters. Frustrated by the failure of their movements to destabilize American society, Kimball claimed, they channeled their discontent into \"politically motivated\" fields like queer theory or African-American studies, said to be inspired by \"postmodern\" Continental thinkers like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. American conservatives of this era followed like-minded thinkers in France who had taken to associating these philosophers with the radical politics of Mai '68 (though the historian Fran\u00e7ois Cusset has argued persuasively that it was mainly in the United States that Foucault, Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard came to be seen as forming a unified movement).\n\nAccording to this emerging group of neoconservative writers -- including Bloom, Kimball, Dinesh D'Souza, and David Brooks, as well as older stalwarts like Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz -- the result of this influx of radical ideas into the academy was that students activists had begun to adopt a dogmatic and anti-democratic understanding of how to achieve equality and social justice. In the name of diversity, they claimed, students at Stanford rejected cultural excellence, demanding to remove \"great books\" written by \"dead white men\" from their general humanities syllabus. In the name of protecting minorities, went a similar argument, students at the University of Michigan abandoned the principle of free speech and sought to impose speech codes banning remarks that could be perceived as racist. It was in a flurry of reports over such campus controversies that Richard Bernstein helped popularize the term \"political correctness\" as we know it today.\n\nThis narrative had an immediate appeal to various segments of the conservative movement. Secretary of Education William Bennett rushed to join the critique of this supposed wave of radical professors and students, characterizing debates over university curricula and campus life as a struggle for the nation's values. In his book The De-Valuing of America, the Reagan cabinet member also suggested that perhaps academics that questioned the moral superiority of the United States should not be entitled to taxpayers' support. Future Second Lady and chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities Lynne Cheney ensured that fighting political correctness would remain a priority of the new administration of George H. W. Bush (who denounced this growing threat in a 1991 commencement speech). And though neoconservative opponents of political correctness were not outspokenly religious -- they mostly appealed to secular values such as humanistic education or maintaining a coherent national culture -- the historian Andrew Hartman has shown how their critiques appealed to New Right activists who believed that the 1960s had ushered in a wave of atheistic immoralism. In the 1980s and 1990s, opposition to political correctness helped stitch together the conservative coalition: a coalition that had always risked coming apart, but found unity in its aversion for anything that reeked of the 1960s.\n\n\u00a4\n\nToday's \"dark web\" enemies of political correctness mostly have little reason to associate themselves with the conservatives of these campus debates. Aside from Ben Shapiro, who calls himself a \"sometimes Trump\" Republican, it is hard to find a member of this movement who identifies in any respect with the American conservative movement of the last half-century (Jordan Peterson occasionally calls himself a conservative, but as a Canadian, he can plausibly distance himself from the GOP). Cultural liberals for the most part, they have little interest in reviving the conservative polemic against the 1960s. There is little reason to think that Sam Harris and the TV host Bill Maher -- outspoken atheists who often promote drug use -- seek a return to \"family values\" traditionalism.\n\nWhat is apparently so novel about the \"intellectual dark web\" is not just its savvy use of Patreon or YouTube, but its claim to be eclectic and transpartisan. It has become typical for the members of this club when they appear in public -- on Harris's or Joe Rogan's podcasts, for example, or on Peterson's and Dave Rubin's YouTube channels -- to stress emphatically both their ideological divides and their respect for the intellectual virtues that they believe allow them to overcome them. In his preface to their discussion on his show, for example, the liberal Harris characteristically praised the conservative Shapiro at length for his willingness to debate him despite their disagreements on questions such as religion and \"free will.\" But this sort of collegial debate tends to be a sideshow for where members of the intellectual dark web almost unanimously agree. The main attraction of Harris and Shapiro's conversation was not their philosophical sparring, but their show of solidarity against the left-wingers that had attacked them both. In the face of the politically correct left, and to a lesser extent the neo-fascist alt-right, these thinkers aim to present themselves as defenders of \"reason,\" \"truth,\" and \"facts.\" This attachment to rational principles -- not to parties or tribes -- leads them at times to characterize themselves as a new political center.\n\nIn principle, these dark web media stars are correct that reason and science belong to neither right nor left. But upon examination of the actual ideas put forward in defense of these values, these supposedly centrist crusaders against political correctness may have more in common with their conservative predecessors than they let on. Though opposed to political \"tribalism,\" as one writer put it in the online magazine Quillette -- the closest thing there is to a party organ of the dark web -- the movement does tend to think of liberals, progressives, and leftists as its primary adversaries. But not only do these thinkers oppose themself to \"the left,\" broadly speaking, they recycle the neoconservative indictment of \"postmodernism\" in order to explain why this left has been taken in by political correctness. Peterson has been the most fervent promoter of this idea, having stated on countless occasions that the contemporary left derives its ideas and tactics from a combination of poststructuralism and Marxism concocted in the United States's universities: a theory of class struggle reimagined as a fight to the death between ethnic, racial, and sexual identity groups.\n\nUnlike Roger Kimball, Peterson does not make much of an effort to link these academic trends to the radical politics of the 1960s. And not all of his allies adopt his analysis of \"postmodern neo-Marxism\" in full. But in various forms throughout the different public platforms of the \"intellectual dark web,\" one finds countless repetitions of the notion that leftist college professors armed with dangerous theories from the Old Continent are turning generations of young progressives into enemies of liberal democracy. In some versions of this refrain, the dark web goes further than the neoconservatives of decades past, whose paeans to traditional college curricula often had little implications outside the campus walls.\n\nIn one conversation between Peterson and Joe Rogan, for example -- evoking the case of former Google employee James Damore fired for his public memo about gender diversity -- the two appeared to suggest that not just elite colleges but the major corporations of Silicon Valley have been captured by the politically correct doctrines spouted by gender studies professors. The dark web frequently asserts that what may appear as trivial campus affairs have had a deep and dark influence on American society as a whole.\n\nThe intellectual dark web does not only recycle conservative theories explaining our supposed wave of left-wing irrationalism. The ideas they claim to defend from politically correct opponents of truth are themselves a longstanding part of the United States's conservative tradition. A common refrain on the dark web is to debunk various left-of-center critiques by arguing that what appears to be systemic inequality is actually the result of individual choices or behavior. Christina Hoff Sommers argues, for example, that the gender wage gap is a result of women's choices to work jobs that pay less, while Ben Shapiro believes the problem of police brutality could be solved by people -- presumably African Americans -- simply \"avoiding interactions with the cops.\" On many occasions, these sorts of arguments involve uses of social science statistics that political correctness is said to ignore; on other occasions the statistics are omitted and the left's blindness to \"reality\" and \"facts\" is simply asserted or implied. In either case, the dark web's impulse when confronted with claims of inequality is almost always to deny or justify it. Either the left is making up injustices where they do not exist, the argument goes, or they disregard evidence that social disparities are in fact grounded in scientific reality.\n\nThese sorts of claims are once again continuous with the decades-old conservative campaign against political correctness. Neoconservatives of the 1980s and 1990s did not always make the same appeals to statistical certainty. But that did not stop writers like Dinesh D'Souza from arguing that politically correct practices like affirmative action in college admissions were an affront to \"equality of opportunity.\" This latter term has long been part of the American right's vocabulary, a central pillar of arguments against attempts at achieving greater social equality. Conservatives have tended to view democracy as a system that establishes equal rules for competition between private individuals; while liberals, progressives, and even many radicals have typically shared this view, the American left has historically supported interventions to guard against excessive inequality. During the campus wars at the end of the 20th century, \"political correctness\" joined the conservative conceptual arsenal to describe and fight against the left's support for \"equal outcomes\" (it is perhaps no coincidence that this new term arose just as the Soviet Union was beginning to crumble). Today, the dark web picks up where they left off.\n\nThe intellectual dark web appears with each passing day to be earning itself a place in the American conservative tradition. The fact that many of these figures have no links to the conservative movement or denounce the Republican Party is hardly evidence to the contrary. Allan Bloom was a member of the Democratic Party, and the campus war debates he helped to start provided the opportunity for many younger writers to gain national notoriety as conservatives for the first time. Despite some of the novelty attributed to the dark web intellectuals, perhaps the signs of their belonging to the right have always been there. Dave Rubin's YouTube show and Harris's podcast, for example, have featured a number of mainstays of the old PC debates, including D'Souza and Charles Murray. And though Christina Hoff Sommers may appear to break with neoconservative opponents of the women's movement such as Midge Decter and Gertrude Himmelfarb by calling her video blog \"The Factual Feminist,\" one should not fail to notice that the channel is hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, the think tank where both elder women were once affiliates.\n\nOne need not doubt that some of the dark web's critiques are made in good faith and based on valid interpretations of social science data. Progressives and leftists can and should deal with these claims on their merits and faults, both in moral and empirical terms. But they should not indulge the intellectual dark web's veneer of novelty or appeals to transpolitical reason. These thinkers ought not to be allowed to pretend that its ideas are, historically speaking, anything other than conservative.\n\n\u00a4\n\nThe intellectual dark web is perhaps a silly name for the group of thinkers it describes, but the search for a novel term does point to the radical transformation of American politics in our current moment. Donald Trump's election has set off a chain reaction that has caused a great many Americans to rethink their ideological commitments and the place of those commitments within the broader society. For the people like Harris, Peterson, Rogan, Rubin, Sommers, Shapiro, Maher, and Weinstein, the noxious effects of political correctness on American society was the central lesson to be drawn from this recent history. And if the often glowing portraits of the dark web in publications like The New York Times and The Atlantic are any indication, or Peterson's appearance at this year's Aspen Ideas Festival, many liberals seem to agree. But though these figures believe their discovery has led them to form the basis of a new intellectual center in this changing context, recent history suggests their ideas may more likely find a home on the right.\n\nIf the intellectual dark web were to acknowledge its place within the conservative tradition -- or perhaps if the public were to acknowledge it for them -- this might have some beneficial effects for American political discourse. Namely, it would allow us to ask them some important questions about what they actually believe is wrong with the United States. If political correctness is the threat to society they claim it is, for example, what exactly has it accomplished since neoconservatives began pointing it out in the late 1980s? One might think that left unchecked for decades, a sophisticated and dangerous campaign to turn America's educated elites against liberal democracy would have gotten further toward pushing the country down the road toward left-wing totalitarianism. As long as the dark web appears unaware of or uninterested in their affinities with these not-too-distant predecessors, we rarely hear explanations of how political correctness actually gains its supposed influence. Instead, we hear decades-old warnings simply repeated as if no time had passed.\n\nRecognizing that these dark web ideas are conservative might also help clear up space for people on the left of center who might share some criticisms of political correctness or campus activism without indulging the right-wing implications of these ideas. Many people across the political spectrum recognize that political correctness and its variants are not meaningless terms. It is no surprise that college students often experiment with activist projects that push the boundaries of liberal norms, and the members of the intellectual dark web are not the only people to have worried about the implications of some student rhetoric.\n\nIn the 1990s, left and progressive thinkers including Richard Rorty, Cornel West, and Edward Said made clear their reservations about certain activist tactics, and articulated positions in line with the same universalist values neoconservatives claimed as their own. Today, magazines like Current Affairs dedicate much of their content to debunking the claims of dark web figures while also addressing the limited effectiveness of \"social justice warrior\" politics. Treating the beliefs of the dark web as politically conservative views, rather than a sort of transpolitical meta-position -- that is to say one critique of political correctness among others, albeit an extreme one -- could do much to bring these sorts of left alternatives into the public debate.\n\nDespite this potential to achieve a greater clarity in our public discourse, there are still reasons to worry about the future of the intellectual dark web. Unlike earlier crusades against political correctness -- which were available primarily to people who subscribed to certain newspapers and magazines, or who happened to be present on the college campuses in question -- this intellectual right in waiting has amassed an incredibly large audience through its various social media platforms. Much of this audience is composed of young men for whom these entertaining take-downs of political correctness is their first exposure to \"intellectual\" discussions of politics and culture. When this dark web finally does come out of the shadows, it may prove a formidable weapon for the next iteration of the conservative movement.\n\n\u00a4", "The Walking Dead's Jeffrey Dean Morgan accidentally revealed he and his partner Hilarie Burton were expecting a baby girl while speaking at the Supernatural convention in New Jersey on Sunday.\n\n'Whoever took this picture??

But if the programme is anything like the trailers that the Corporation has been running, this will be like any other in the long line of BBC productions featuring Hobsbawm: fawning, obsequious and faintly nauseating in its sycophancy. It will treat the unapologetic ex-Communist not as an apologist for an indefensible system of terror and murder who should not be given the time of day, let alone airtime, but as a revered Pope of history whose perverse opinions should be received with awed respect. So why does the BBC roll out the red carpet - emphasis on the 'red' - for this old man's vile views?\n\nFawning: Radio 4 is to broadcast an interview with nonagenarian Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm\n\nI think that it is because it blindly believes, with Hobsbawm, that essentially liberalism and Communism are much the same thing, rather than the antithesis of each other; and that anyone with 'Progressive' leftist views who happens to have lived into their ninth decade should be placed on a pedestal and worshipped without being asked too closely just what he has represented throughout his long life.\n\nThe ghastly, shameful truth about Hobsbawm is this: from joining the Stalinist Communist Youth movement in Germany in 1931 to leaving the Communist Party of Great Britain as it folded following the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991, Eric Hobsbawm has been a proud supporter of the totalitarian madness that killed around 100 million human beings in the 20th century. Even in his dotage, he refuses to apologise for his sixty years as a card-carrying Communist, because, according to his friend, the journalist Neal Ascherson 'Eric doesn't feel the need to apologise. He's not that sort of person'. So that's alright, then.\n\nLet us be clear, then, exactly what it is that Hobsbawm supported for all those years (and, we must assume, since he has never recanted, still supports). Indeed, in the BBC trailer he tells Schama that the history of the 20th century did not turn out as he had hoped it would. If this has any meaning (and, when it suits him Hobsbawm is as slippery and evasive as an eel when he doesn't want to be pinned down) it must mean that his beloved Communism was utterly defeated and discredited, and that this is a matter for profound regret.\n\nCard-carrying Communist: Hobsbawm was a Soviet apologist in earlier life\n\nEric, who, needless to say has never actually lived under a Communist regime, told a TV interviewer in 1994 that the lives of the 20 million people slaughtered by Stalin would have been a price well worth paying if the 'radiant tomorrow' promised by Communism had actually materialised.\n\nA price worth paying? Millions were slaughtered in Stalin's Terror\n\nSo Professor Eric, Companion of Honour, and President of Birkbeck College, from his elevated mansion high on the hills of Hampstead, loftily tells us that the parents who ate their own children in the deliberately induced Ukrainian famine; the peasants butchered for hoarding grain; the loyal Communist lackeys shot in the back of the neck in the cellars of the Lubyanka; the millions of slaves worked to death in the Gulag; the 'enemies' tortured into making their false confessions before execution; the entire army groups exterminated because his hero Stalin trusted Hitler - all those sacrifices would have been OK for a few radiant tomorrows. Have I got that right?\n\nWorked to death: Millions of political prisoners were sent to the gulags\n\nTurning away in disgust, I thought about another elderly historian, by strange coincidence born exactly a month after Hobsbawm, whose life, in contrast to the accolades shamefully heaped by British academia on his Communist contemporary, has been a shining example of honesty and courage in the face of neglect and vilification.\n\nLike Hobsbawm, Professor Robert Conquest was born in the summer of 1917 - that fateful year when the Bolshevik revolution ushered in the long nightmare of Communism. Like Hobsbawm, he joined the Communist party as a youth in the 1930s. Unlike Hobsbawm, Conquest saw the error of his Marxist ways, after a wartime spell in Bulgaria - then in the process of being swallowed by Stalin - showed him the brute reality of Communism in action. From then on, Conquest did what he could to counter the Communist plague.\n\nSummer 1968: As Soviet troops rolled into Prague, Robert Conquest (below) published 'The Great Terror'\n\nIn 1968, the year when 'fun revolutionaries' were marching with Marxist banners in the streets of the West as Soviet tanks crushed the Prague Spring (Hobsbawm remained in the Communist party throughout, as he had during the even bloodier repression of Hungary a decade earlier) Conquest published 'The Great Terror' the fullest account yet of Stalin's murderous purges. The book was met with indifference, even hostility, while Hobsbawm's tomes were lavished with praise and prizes.\n\nAccording to Conquest, Hobsbawn's defence of Communism in the Soviet Union is a 'denial of reality'. Following the fall of the Wall, Conquest was asked whether he wanted to update the book, and if so, if he wished to re-title it. He thought for a moment before suggesting the title: 'I told you so you ******* Fools'.\n\nAs the BBC falls once again at Hobsbawm's feet, I think we can safely assume that they will not be paying a similar tribute to Robert Conquest. Sadly, there are still far too many ******* Fools (or worse) in Academia and in the Corporation for that.", "'Do what I say, don't do what I do' - The hypocrisy of the Left over education\n\nBy Nigel Jones for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 11:03 EDT, 25 July 2012 | Updated: 13:07 EDT, 26 July 2012\n\nReading the obituary of the radical left-wing journalist Alexander Cockburn this week, I was shocked but scarcely surprised to discover that his Alma Mater was the exclusive Glenalmond College in Perthshire. If Fettes, Tony Blair's old school, is often called 'Scotland's Eton' then Glenalmond is its Harrow - ie. an excellent independent school offering a superb education - at a price - chiefly to the children of the rich.\n\nExclusive schooling: Radical left-wing journalist Alexander Cockburn, who passed away this week, attended the exclusive Glenalmond College in Perthshire\n\nMy shock that Alexander - along with his two journalist brothers Patrick and Andrew - were educated at this elite Establishment comes from the fact that the father who sent them there, Claud Cockburn, was a lifelong Stalinist Communist, who, despite his own privileged public school education, spent his life inveighing against the iniquities of capitalism, betraying his own upper-crust class, shamelessly lying on behalf of his Soviet masters, (his whoppers about the Spanish Civil War were exposed by George Orwell, no less ) - and working tirelessly for the triumph of totalitarian tyranny. Yet Claud Cockburn bought his three sons the best private education his money could buy - and presumably saw nothing wrong in such hypocrisy.\n\nPrivate schools: Many Labour politicians have attempted to destroy both Grammar Schools and then independent education, whilst still sending their own children to private schools\n\nYet hypocrisy is the besetting sin of the Left, and it certainly didn't die with Claud Cockburn. I have literally lost count of the number of Labour politicians in my lifetime who have with one hand laboured to destroy first the Grammar Schools, and then independent education - while at the same time sending their own children to private schools. Recent examples include Diane Abbott, Ruth Kelly, and of course Harriet Harman. For them, it seems, it has always been a case of 'Do what I say - don't do what I do'.\n\nMore from Nigel Jones for the Daily Mail...

Over at the Guardian, house organ of the middle-class Left, its most unreconstructured class-war warriors are themselves scions of the system they wish to destroy. George Monbiot, the newspaper's leading Eco- fanatic, who wants us all to stop flying off on holiday, trade in our cars for bicycles, and generally adopt a lifestyle of primitive communism fuelled by cow farts, went to Stowe public school; while his editorial colleague Seumus Milne, a stern Marxist whose worldview fossilised just before Communism collapsed in 1989, is an Old Boy of Winchester. The paper's veteran columnist, Polly Toynbee, who with her three homes is the Queen Bee of Leftist hypocrisy, despite campaigning for state education, sent her own children to private schools.\n\nThe moral decline of Labour from its origins a century ago as the genuine voice of the working class to the 21st century party of the chattering classes, is clearly shown by the efforts that the middle class who now make up the overwhelming proportion of the party's members and MPs to destroy the opportunities open to the poor and under-privileged to better themselves by education. It was a Labour Education Secretary in the 1960s, the repulsive Anthony Crosland, who told his wife that his aim was 'To destroy every f*****g grammar school in this country' - and largely succeeded in doing so.\n\nDespite the success of some of the Comprehensive schools that Crosland and his successors like Shirley Williams brought in to replace Grammar Schools, the fact remains that in killing the Grammar Schools, Labour chopped off the ladder traditionally climbed by able and bright kids from disadvantaged backgrounds and by doing so, set in stone the inequalities that they claim to hate. And it cannot be denied that far too many Comprehensives are, in Alastair Campbell's memorable phrase, 'Bog standard' schools that are failing their pupils, and are places that our middle-class socialist ruling caste would never dream of sending their kids to.", "The BBC declined to have a statue of George Orwell outside its headquarters. Quite right - his genius deserves better\n\nBy Nigel Jones for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 08:58 EDT, 22 August 2012 | Updated: 15:38 EDT, 22 August 2012\n\nWhat a weird organisation the British Broadcasting Corporation is.\n\nDay in and day out they pump a diet of increasingly overt Leftist propaganda into our homes - this week driving even mild-mannered Employment Secretary Ian Duncan-Smith to an uncharacteristic expletive-filled fury about their bias - yet when it is suggested that they put up a statue to socialist George Orwell, undoubtedly the greatest writer to have been (albeit briefly) a BBC employee, Director-General Mark Thompson reacts with all the horror of a maiden aunt caught with her bloomers down.\n\nVeteran BBC broadcaster (and naturally a Labour stalwart) Baroness Joan Bakewell says she made the statue suggestion to Thompson at a BBC reception earlier this year. Lady Bakewell, a member of the George Orwell Memorial Trust which has commissioned the stature from sculptor Martin Jennings, cornered the DG at a party and urged him to site the statue outside the BBC's expensive new HQ at Oxford Circus in central London, close to where Orwell once laboured in Broadcasting House. But to her baffled dismay, Thompson did not exactly welcome her plan to honour the great man, allegedly telling her it was far too Left-wing an idea.\n\nGeorge Orwell: The literary titan worked for the BBC from 1941-43, broadcasting a mix of war propaganda and intellectual chat to India\n\nComing from a man who has admitted that the BBC once had an institutional Leftist bias (though he laughably went on to claim that this is now a thing of the past), Thompson's reaction is somewhat surprising.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for the DG's reluctance to honour Orwell with a statue on BBC premises. It could be sheer ignorance of Orwell's work and politics. It could be bureaucratic inertia. Or it could be the hatred still held by many on the Left for Orwell - the man who in his novels 'Animal Farm' and '1984' wrote the most damning indictments of Marxist totalitarianism ever penned.\n\nMore from Nigel Jones for the Daily Mail...

Orwell finally quit the Corporation, partly in disgust at the poor quality of the propaganda scripts he was required to read, and partly because it dawned on him that his high-minded literary talks on - to take one example - the verse of Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins - would mean little to the average Indian peasant, who would be unlikely, in any event, to even possess a radio set.\n\nAnother reason for Thompson's horror may be that he knows that Orwell's view of the Corporation was, at best, ambivalent. He savagely caricatured it in '1984' as the 'Ministry of Truth', pumping out a daily diet of lying propaganda on behalf of the ruling party's ideology 'Ingsoc' (Newspeak for 'English Socialism'). Does that sound familiar?\n\nBut even if Baroness Bakewell's idea did give Mr T the shudders, Orwell still richly deserves his statue. Far from being 'Left-wing' in the sense we now understand it, Orwell's thought moved during his life from an understandable disgust with the harsher aspects of imperialism and capitalism, experienced during his Burmese days and his time as a tramp down and out in Paris and London, through the Great Depression when he witnessed unemployment and the life of miners at first hand.\n\nOrwell's Socialism was literally knocked out of him by his appalling experiences in the Spanish Civil War. Going out to Catalonia to fight Franco's military revolt against the Spanish republic, he was shot through the throat by a sniper, and while recovering, was caught up in a bloody purge launched by Spain's increasingly Communist-controlled Republican Government.\n\nThe experience of being hunted by the secret police and seeing his comrades arrested, tortured and killed by the Spanish Stalinists and their Russian bosses gave Orwell an abiding horror of Marxism, Soviet Communism and Stalin's many British apologists - including his own publisher, Victor Gollancz, who refused to publish Orwell's account of his Spanish experiences 'Homage to Catalonia' for fear of upsetting the Communists. Finally, Orwell saw what crimes could be committed in the name of 'socialism' and devoted the rest of his literary life to denouncing the perversion of the humane socialism he stood for.\n\nThough dying of TB, Orwell lived long enough to transmute his horror of Communism into his twin masterpieces 'Animal Farm' and '1984' and at the dawn of the Cold War, drew up at the request of the British security services a list of 50 of his fellow writers whom he regarded as Communists or fellow-travellers.\n\nA doughty warrior in the cause of liberty, free thought and political prose as clear as a glass pane, Orwell deserves his statue all right - but on second thoughts perhaps Mark Thompson is right.\n\nToday's BBC - aka the Ministry of Truth - might not be the best place for it after all.", "The Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, on Wednesday called on the Ekiti State Governor-elect, Kayode Fayemi to give \"Muslims in the state proportionate representation in government appointments.\"\n\nMURIC anchored its call on the fact that Muslims in the state cast \"massive protest votes against Fayose on Saturday because the latter was a Muslim hater and a con artist whose major preoccupation was the marginalization of Muslims in government appointments, the demolition of mosques, making mockery of Muslims and harassing Islamic scholars.\"\n\nIn a congratulatory message signed by its Director, Ishaq Akintola and sent to DAILY POST, the organization also advised the governor-elect to remain level-headed and sympathetic to the poor and elderly citizens of the state.\n\nMURIC also warned that Fayose's \"downward slide has just begun.\"\n\nThe message reads, \"We complained in vain early in 2014 when Fayose formed an all-Christian cabinet.

We will use every constitutional means at our disposal to give extremist crusaders a run for their money because this country belongs to all of us. Muslims will no longer remain underdogs in this country: oppressed, repressed and downpressed.\n\n\"We are watching governors in the South East who are in the habit of depriving the minority Muslims of their Allah-given fundamental human rights. They refuse to give Certificates of Occupancy (C of Os) for mosques. They demolish mosques at will while heads of tertiary institutions disallow Muslim students from worshipping and building mosques inside campuses. They also demolish existing make-shift mosques on campuses using flimsy excuses.\n\n\"In conclusion, we appeal to Governor-Elect Fayemi to make his in-coming government inclusive and to redress the wrongs done to Ekiti Muslims by his irritant predecessor by giving them befitting government posts and returning to them all their civil rights. Apart from a proportionate number of commissioners, permanent secretaries and board chairmen, we particularly demand that the post of secretary to the state government should go to a Muslim since both Fayemi and his deputy are Christians. In return, we urge Muslims in Ekiti to give the in-coming Fayemi regime all necessary support\".", "The Handmaid's Tale\n\nSunday, Channel 4\n\nRating:\n\nPatrick Melrose\n\nSunday, Sky Atlantic\n\nRating:\n\nA Very English Scandal\n\nSunday, BBC1\n\nRating:\n\nThere are currently three five-star dramas playing across Sunday evenings, including the second season of The Handmaid's Tale, and our return to the totalitarian Republic of Gilead, which has yet to appear in any of those round-ups of where to go this summer, understandably. Apparently, Corfu has taken off due to The Durrells, but The Durrells offers nice scenery and donkeys and comedy Greeks, whereas Gilead offers none of these. A pity, really, as nice scenery and a donkey and a comedy Greek would certainly help it as a tourist destination, as well as lighten the mood of the place. By heavens, Handmaid's is harrowing.\n\nThe second series has moved beyond Margaret Atwood narratively, even though she's still involved, and people were wondering how the story might progress. We now have the answer: just as harrowingly (by heavens). We still have the painterly light and the stunning visual orchestrations - the beauty of it somehow makes it yet more disturbing - and we still have Elisabeth Moss as Offred and Ann Dowd as terrifying Aunt Lydia, and it's same old, same old in Gilead, without even an olive grove in sight but with misogynistic sadism stretching as far as the eye can see.\n\nElisabeth Moss's incredible performance is compelling. The second series has moved beyond Margaret Atwood narratively, even though she's still involved\n\nThe opening minutes of episode one showed Offred and her fellow handmaids being punished for refusing to stone Janine. They were muzzled, thought they were about to be hanged - the nooses were around their necks and everything, but it was only Aunt Lydia's little joke, ha ha - plus we also saw a woman having her arm set on fire. I mostly watched with my jumper pulled up over my head. The weather being warm, it was a cotton fine knit, so I could still see, gauzily, just about, but it took the edge off. So why watch at all?\n\nSome say they can't any more; that it's too unceasingly bleak and has tipped into torture porn. Fair point, but if you are going to imagine misogyny taken to the nth degree then cruelty and violence against women will have to figure. It would be a cop-out, otherwise, and cowardly. Also, it is as compelling as it is horrific. Elisabeth Moss's incredible performance is compelling, our investment in Offred is compelling and the narrative is compelling, as hope is always laid out before us. Hope is crushed, but there is always fresh hope. Will Offred escape this time? Can we trust Nick? Have I finished with being harrowed today? Yes, if you left it there, but not if you watched episode two of Patrick Melrose. Brilliant. But harrowing. Sunday evenings: stay in and be harrowed. Then work won't seem so bad the next day?\n\nThis episode, set 20 years earlier than the first, was set in a house in Provence during one hot, languid day, when the figs rotted all around, and when Patrick was a boy about to have his innocence smashed. We now know what happened behind that bedroom door; we know what his father did to him, why Patrick became a heroin addict. By heavens, that father. Patrolling sadistically in his silky dressing gown, stubbing cigars out on flies, talking to the housekeeper until she shook, savagely controlling Patrick's mother.\n\nIt could have been cartoonish but Hugo Weaving's performance meant you understood he too was damaged and the damage and the rot will just go on and on unless Patrick is able to, one day, put a stop to it. This is as heartbreaking as it is harrowing, and so richly layered that if you rewatch episode one after episode two you'll find it's even better than the first time round.\n\nOn to A Very English Scandal, the dramatisation of the years leading up to Jeremy Thorpe's 1979 trial for the attempted murder of his bothersome young lover, Norman Scott. Heavy, you probably imagined, and maybe even harrowing, but as written by Russell T Davies and directed by Stephen Frears, the touch is so skilfully light it whizzes along and is supremely entertaining. It's snappy, it's funny, it's pacy, it's smart, it's wry. With Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Scott, it did sometimes sound as if Grant were seducing Paddington, but can we choose not to go there? As it's too weird.\n\nThe script is excellent. 'Tell him not to talk. And not to write to my mother describing acts of anal sex under any circumstances whatsoever,' said Thorpe, who was struggling to control Scott at the time. And the performances are delicious. Grant has been described as 'revelatory', which may be a step too far as he is still decidedly Hugh Grant-ish, but he isn't one note. His Thorpe is charming yet sly, winning yet venal, while Whishaw makes Scott as poignantly troubled as he is troublesome. Blissful lesser parts, too, including Alex Jennings as Thorpe's confidante, Peter Bessell, and David Bamber as Lord Arran with those badgers running all over the place. Joys everywhere you look, and I was not harrowed. Which was a novelty, in and of itself.", "President Trump claims he misspoke Monday, accidentally leaving out the word \"not\" when he said it was beyond his imagination to understand \"why it would\" be Russia that interfered with the 2016 election.\n\nHe claimed he was not taking Vladimir Putin's word over the American intelligence community's, even though that's exactly what he's tried to do for the last two years.\n\nIt is an unbelievable excuse, but sadly, some people will choose to believe it.\n\nThat's the way our politics works these days. People get the news they want to hear and dismiss anything that makes them uncomfortable as fake. With his embrace of a dictator, Trump may have upset members of the political establishment on both sides of the Atlantic, but he has not lost the people who matter most to him.\n\nTrump's favorability rating is only 43 percent overall, according to the Gallup polling agency, but it's 89 percent among Republicans, which is close to the highest approval rating any president has had at this stage in their administration among members of their own party.\n\nRepublican office holders, especially those who will face the voters in November, are well aware of these numbers and have been very careful in their criticism. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, from Maine's 2nd District, issued a short statement Monday that omitted Trump's name, praised his diplomacy but added \"we must also recognize the consensus that Russia did try to interfere in our election.\"\n\nBut the consensus is that they did more than try. Thirteen Russians have been indicted in a disinformation scheme that created fraudulent organizations and pumped false reports into individual swing voters' social media accounts. Just last week, a dozen Russian intelligence agents were indicted for allegedly stealing information from computers belonging to the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and using it to help Trump.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee found that Russian hackers tried to get into the computers of election officials in all 50 states and succeeded in some of them. They didn't just try to interfere -- they did interfere.\n\nSen. Susan Collins issued a statement that called Trump's position \"untenable,\" which means \"not able to be maintained,\" but she did not say what would happen if he tries to maintain it.\n\nCollins has served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which, unlike its counterpart in the House, has produced a bipartisan report that tries to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016.\n\nBut it's really up to rank-and-file Republicans to decide how much they are willing to ignore. Will they continue to discount indictments from the Mueller investigation, and make up conspiracy-theory fever dreams about a deep-state coup, or will they reflect on the way that a totalitarian dictator was able to manipulate us from the other side of the world?\n\nUnless Democrats start winning elections, Republicans control the three branches of the federal government, so they have a responsibility look beyond the partisan talking points they are getting from their favorite media outlets.\n\nThat Russia tried to swing the election for Trump is not up for debate. Why Trump would want to keep that quiet is still an open question. It's one that Trump supporters should be asking themselves right now.\n\n< Previous\n\nView from Away: Is federal property fair game?\n\nfiled under: Donald Trump, Our View Related Stories Latest Articles Politics Lawmakers await details on LePage's plan for hospital tax to fund Medicaid expansion Vegan Kitchen Seven vegan cookbooks well-suited for summer reading Food & Dining Ri Ra goes Whole Hog with plans for barbecue spot Food & Dining Beloved blueberry cake shows why Marjorie Standish is Maine's home cooking icon Opinion Commentary: Maine panel chooses better strategy for opioid crisis than Sessions Wake up to the local news you need Enter your email and our daily headlines will be delivered to your inbox each morning.

The images show innocent fun, but a voice-over (delivered by a young girl) declares that the movies were shot by the Stasi, the former Soviet satellite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secret police.\n\nThe film, made by Epperlein and her husband Michael Tucker, is a documentary, but it comes close to being a genre film, exploring the mystery behind the suicide of Epperlein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, Wolfgang. He killed himself within a few years of the fall of the Berlin Wall, hounded by anonymous letters claiming he was a Stasi agent. He left an odd suicide note for Petra ending with \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest regards\u00e2\u0080\u009d and claiming he was killing himself because he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand life in Germany anymore.\n\nEpperlein and Tucker start their film by investigating whether it could really be true that her father was a Stasi agent. Although the voice-over, as far as I could tell from the press kit, is delivered (in a half-German, half-American accent) by Epperlein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, Matilda Tucker, not Epperlein herself, the co-director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence dominates the film. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKarl Marx City\u00e2\u0080\u009d could almost be a spiritual sequel \u00e2\u0080\" or feminist answer \u00e2\u0080\" to Wim Wenders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWings of Desire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which male angels watch over Berlin a few years before the Wall fell. Epperlein comes across as their female equivalent, although she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the former Karl Marx City (now once again known as Chemnitz), where she grew up, not Berlin. Nevertheless, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cosmopolitan fl\u00c3\u00a2neur of sorts, always clad in a leather coat, wearing headphones and carrying a huge microphone. These function as visual props, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re genuinely necessary: Epperlein recorded sound for the film while Tucker, whose presence is completely invisible, filmed her.\n\nPetra Epperlein investigates the East Germany whose demise her father could not survive\n\nMost of \u00e2\u0080\u009cKarl Marx City\u00e2\u0080\u009d was shot in high-contrast black and white. I think many Americans think this is the only way to do justice to a story about East German spies, as though the directors were adapting a \u00e2\u0080\u009860s John Le Carr\u00c3\u00a9 novel in documentary form. The beauty of Tucker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cinematography speaks for itself, but it was also shot to be able to integrate well with archival footage, also filmed in black and white. The Stasi trained their agents to shoot in public with hidden cameras. The film even manages to find a surveillance camera remake of the Lumi\u00c3\u00a8re brothers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 early cinema landmark \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorkers Leaving the Factory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the years after the Wall fell, the former East Germany had a sky-high suicide rate and many other problems. Some areas of the former East Germany are now plagued by far more poverty than the affluent West and an increasing problem with racism and xenophobia. Some writers have compared to the psychological effects of the fall of the Wall and the reunification of Germany with the end of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civil War. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not likening white East Germans to African Americans in any way, they seem to still bear the marks of difference to their Western counterparts, who are richer and more adjusted to capitalism.\n\nEast Germany became the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest surveillance state, with huge numbers of Stasi agents infiltrating every aspect of public and private life. (This contributed to the post-Wall suicide spike, with many agents who were exposed in the early \u00e2\u0080\u009890s taking their own lives.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cKarl Marx City\u00e2\u0080\u009d went into production around the time Edward Snowden went public with his revelations about the NSA. Epperlein has expressed her reservations regarding the totalitarian potential of social media, creating a world where the Stasi doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to exist because people post all kinds of data about themselves on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and elsewhere. Watching the film, I suddenly remembered that I belong to Goodreads and have been supplying anyone who has access to my Facebook feed with a list of all the books I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read for the past five years. I like the ability to share this list with my friends and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care if Mark Zuckerberg is snooping in; the FBI and NSA are another story.\n\nFamously, William Faulkner said that the past is never really past. Epperlein gets an answer to her questions about her father. Her pain remains raw. And if the former East Germany is freer now, America and the rest of Europe are inheriting some of the problems it once had with surveillance.\n\nKARL MARX CITY |\u00c2 Directed by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker |\u00c2 Bond/ 360 | In English and German with English subtitles |\u00c2 Opens Mar. 29 | Film Forum,209 W.

I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture.\n\nI thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didn't conform to two-minute soundbites. But given the strange and uncertain times that we are in - and they are strange, and they are uncertain - with each day's news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective.\n\nSo I hope you'll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where we've been, and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a roadmap for where we need to go next.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of Mvezo-In his autobiography he describes a happy childhood; he's looking after cattle, he's playing with the other boys, eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And as many of you know, he's quoted saying, \"Why she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.\"\n\nThere was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid. Most of Africa, including my father's homeland, was under colonial rule.\n\nThe dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madiba's birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labour. And the inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given.\n\nAnd such a view of the world - that certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquest - that view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks. Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks.\n\nAnd around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and color and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country.\n\nThat was the world just 100 years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second World War, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the 20th century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination, but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual.\n\nIn those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed; and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted; and access to public education was expanded; and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. And in my own country, the moral force of the civil rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalized groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship.\n\nIt was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homeland - a fight to end apartheid, a fight to ensure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised non-white citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs.\n\nMadiba's light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late '70s he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to reexamine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, you'll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world.Do you remember that feeling? It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted people's lives and confined the human spirit - that all that was crumbling before our eyes.\n\nAnd then as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections; as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood that, we understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world.\n\nAnd during the last decades of the 20th century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesn't mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward. Yes, there were still tragedies - bloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo. Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear d\u00e9tente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the world's system of trade - all that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the world's great powers. And from Europe to Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies.\n\nThe march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive.\n\nAnd with these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadn't counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power; they had the possibilities of doing business. And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts.\n\nAnd suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once-starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted. And meanwhile, the spread of the internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially, all the world's knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village.\n\nThat's what happened just over the course of a few decades. And all that progress is real. It has been broad, and it has been deep, and it all happened in what - by the standards of human history - was nothing more than a blink of an eye. And now an entire generation has grown up in a world that by most measures has gotten steadily freer and healthier and wealthier and less violent and more tolerant during the course of their lifetimes.\n\nIt should make us hopeful. But if we cannot deny the very real strides that our world has made since that moment when Madiba took those steps out of confinement, we also have to recognize all the ways that the international order has fallen short of its promise. In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business.\n\nSo we have to start by admitting that whatever laws may have existed on the books, whatever wonderful pronouncements existed in constitutions, whatever nice words were spoken during these last several decades at international conferences or in the halls of the United Nations, the previous structures of privilege and power and injustice and exploitation never completely went away. They were never fully dislodged.\n\nCaste differences still impact the life chances of people on the Indian subcontinent. Ethnic and religious differences still determine who gets opportunity from the Central Europe to the Gulf. It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa. And it is also a fact that the accumulated disadvantages of years of institutionalized oppression have created yawning disparities in income, and in wealth, and in education, and in health, in personal safety, in access to credit. Women and girls around the world continue to be blocked from positions of power and authority. They continue to be prevented from getting a basic education. They are disproportionately victimized by violence and abuse. They're still paid less than men for doing the same work. That's still happening.\n\nEconomic opportunity, for all the magnificence of the global economy, all the shining skyscrapers that have transformed the landscape around the world, entire neighborhoods, entire cities, entire regions, entire nations have been bypassed. In other words, for far too many people, the more things have changed, the more things stayed the same.\n\nAnd while globalization and technology have opened up new opportunities, have driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalization has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It's also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor's bargaining power. It's made it easier for capital to avoid tax laws and the regulations of nation-states - can just move billions, trillions of dollars with a tap of a computer key.\n\nAnd the result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It's meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That's not an exaggeration, that's a statistic. Think about that. In many middle-income and developing countries, new wealth has just tracked the old bad deal that people got because it reinforced or even compounded existing patterns of inequality, the only difference is it created even greater opportunities for corruption on an epic scale. And for once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don't have specialized skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms.\n\nIn every country just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries' political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored. Now, it should be noted that this new international elite, the professional class that supports them, differs in important respects from the ruling aristocracies of old. It includes many who are self-made. It includes champions of meritocracy. And although still mostly white and male, as a group they reflect a diversity of nationalities and ethnicities that would have not existed a hundred years ago. A decent percentage consider themselves liberal in their politics, modern and cosmopolitan in their outlook.\n\nUnburdened by parochialism, or nationalism, or overt racial prejudice or strong religious sentiment, they are equally comfortable in New York or London or Shanghai or Nairobi or Buenos Aires, or Johannesburg. Many are sincere and effective in their philanthropy. Some of them count Nelson Mandela among their heroes. Some even supported Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States, and by virtue of my status as a former head of state, some of them consider me as an honorary member of the club. And I get invited to these fancy things, you know? They'll fly me out.\n\nBut what's nevertheless true is that in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin.\n\nAnd their decisions - their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labour, or their decision to pay a bribe - are often done without malice; it's just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.\n\nBut too often, these decisions are also made without reference to notions of human solidarity - or a ground-level understanding of the consequences that will be felt by particular people in particular communities by the decisions that are made. And from their board rooms or retreats, global decision-makers don't get a chance to see sometimes the pain in the faces of laid-off workers.\n\nTheir kids don't suffer when cuts in public education and health care result as a consequence of a reduced tax base because of tax avoidance. They can't hear the resentment of an older tradesman when he complains that a newcomer doesn't speak his language on a job site where he once worked. They're less subject to the discomfort and the displacement that some of their countrymen may feel as globalisation scrambles not only existing economic arrangements, but traditional social and religious mores.\n\nWhich is why, at the end of the 20th century, while some Western commentators were declaring the end of history and the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy and the virtues of the global supply chain, so many missed signs of a brewing backlash - a backlash that arrived in so many forms. It announced itself most violently with 9/11 and the emergence of transnational terrorist networks, fueled by an ideology that perverted one of the world's great religions and asserted a struggle not just between Islam and the West but between Islam and modernity, and an ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq didn't help, accelerating a sectarian conflict. Russia, already humiliated by its reduced influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, feeling threatened by democratic movements along its borders, suddenly started reasserting authoritarian control and in some cases meddling with its neighbors.\n\nChina, emboldened by its economic success, started bristling against criticism of its human rights record; it framed the promotion of universal values as nothing more than foreign meddling, imperialism under a new name.\n\nWithin the United States, within the European Union, challenges to globalization first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right, as you started seeing populist movements - which, by the way, are often cynically funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing government constraints on their business interests - these movements tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores; fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn't look like them or sound like them or pray as they did.\n\nAnd perhaps more than anything else, the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in which the reckless behavior of financial elites resulted in years of hardship for ordinary people all around the world, made all the previous assurances of experts ring hollow - all those assurances that somehow financial regulators knew what they were doing, that somebody was minding the store, that global economic integration was an unadulterated good.\n\nBecause of the actions taken by governments during and after that crisis, including, I should add, by aggressive steps by my administration, the global economy has now returned to healthy growth. But the credibility of the international system, the faith in experts in places like Washington or Brussels, all that had taken a blow.\n\nAnd a politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear, and that kind of politics is now on the move. It's on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts. Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained - the form of it - but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. In the West, you've got far-right parties that oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism.\n\nMany developing countries now are looking at China's model of authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good? The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media - once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity - has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.\n\nSo on Madiba's 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads - a moment in time at which two very different visions of humanity's future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories, two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond?\n\nShould we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba's release from prison, from the Berlin Wall coming down - should we see that hope that we had as na\u00efve and misguided? Should we understand the last 25 years of global integration as nothing more than a detour from the previous inevitable cycle of history - where might makes right, and politics is a hostile competition between tribes and races and religions, and nations compete in a zero-sum game, constantly teetering on the edge of conflict until full-blown war breaks out? Is that what we think?\n\nLet me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela's vision. I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King and Abraham Lincoln. I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they're endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible and that it can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good. That's what I believe.\n\nAnd I believe we have no choice but to move forward; that those of us who believe in democracy and civil rights and a common humanity have a better story to tell. And I believe this not just based on sentiment, I believe it based on hard evidence.\n\nThe fact that the world's most prosperous and successful societies, the ones with the highest living standards and the highest levels of satisfaction among their people, happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal, progressive ideal that we talk about and have nurtured the talents and contributions of all their citizens.\n\nThe fact that authoritarian governments have been shown time and time again to breed corruption, because they're not accountable; to repress their people; to lose touch eventually with reality; to engage in bigger and bigger lies that ultimately result in economic and political and cultural and scientific stagnation. Look at history. Look at the facts.\n\nThe fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together - eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books.\n\nThe fact that technology cannot be put back in a bottle, so we're stuck with the fact that we now live close together and populations are going to be moving, and environmental challenges are not going to go away on their own, so that the only way to effectively address problems like climate change or mass migration or pandemic disease will be to develop systems for more international cooperation, not less.\n\nWe have a better story to tell. But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men. (Laughter and History shows how easily people can be convinced to turn on those who look different, or worship God in a different way.\n\nSo if we're truly to continue Madiba's long walk towards freedom, we're going to have to work harder and we're going to have to be smarter. We're going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past. And so in the brief time remaining, let me just suggest a few guideposts for the road ahead, guideposts that draw from Madiba's work, his words, the lessons of his life.\n\nFirst, Madiba shows those of us who believe in freedom and democracy we are going to have to fight harder to reduce inequality and promote lasting economic opportunity for all people.\n\nNow, I don't believe in economic determinism. Human beings don't live on bread alone. But they need bread. And history shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly; and that once people achieve more than mere subsistence, then they're measuring their well-being by how they compare to their neighbours, and whether their children can expect to live a better life.\n\nAnd when economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow - and that dynamic eats away at democracy. Sometimes it may be straight-out corruption, but sometimes it may not involve the exchange of money; it's just folks who are that wealthy get what they want, and it undermines human freedom.\n\nAnd Madiba understood this. This is not new. He warned us about this. He said: \"Where globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and the powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and the weaker, [then] we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.\" That's what he said.\n\nSo if we are serious about universal freedom today, if we care about social justice today, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. And I would respectfully amend what Madiba said. I don't do it often, but I'd say it's not enough for us to protest; we're going to have to build, we're going to have to innovate, we're going to have to figure out how do we close this widening chasm of wealth and opportunity both within countries and between them.\n\nAnd how we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new president is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so. But we can learn from the last 70 years that it will not involve unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism. It also won't involve old-style command-and-control socialism form the top. That was tried; it didn't work very well. For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system - one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker - - that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business; that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich but they're giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.\n\nI should add, by the way, right now I'm actually surprised by how much money I've got, and let me tell you something: I don't have half as much as most of these folks or a tenth or a hundredth. There's only so much you can eat. There's only so big a house you can have. There's only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it's enough. You don't have to take a vow of poverty just to say, \"Well, let me help out and let a few of the other folks - let me look at that child out there who doesn't have enough to eat or needs some school fees, let me help him out. I'll pay a little more in taxes. It's okay. I can afford it.\"\n\nI mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more, instead of saying, \"Wow, I've got so much. Who can I help? How can I give more and more and more?\" That's ambition. That's impact. That's influence. What an amazing gift to be able to help people, not just yourself. Where was I? I ad-libbed. You get the point.\n\nIt involves promoting an inclusive capitalism both within nations and between nations. And as we pursue, for example, the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to get past the charity mindset. We've got to bring more resources to the forgotten pockets of the world through investment and entrepreneurship, because there is talent everywhere in the world if given an opportunity.\n\nWhen it comes to the international system of commerce and trade, it's legitimate for poorer countries to continue to seek access to wealthier markets. And by the way, wealthier markets, that's not the big problem that you're having - that a small African country is sending you tea and flowers. That's not your biggest economic challenge. It's also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries, to make sure that they're providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers.\n\nBut even as there are discussions to be had around trade and commerce, it's important to recognize this reality: while the outsourcing of jobs from north to south, from east to west, while a lot of that was a dominant trend in the late 20th century, the biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology.\n\nAnd the biggest challenge for your new president when we think about how we're going to employ more people here is going to be also technology, because artificial intelligence is here and it is accelerating, and you're going to have driverless cars, and you're going to have more and more automated services, and that's going to make the job of giving everybody work that is meaningful tougher, and we're going to have to be more imaginative, and the pact of change is going to require us to do more fundamental reimagining of our social and political arrangements, to protect the economic security and the dignity that comes with a job. It's not just money that a job provides; it provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose.\n\nAnd so we're going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our workweek, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. But we're going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track.\n\nSecond, Madiba teaches us that some principles really are universal - and the most important one is the principle that we are bound together by a common humanity and that each individual has inherent dignity and worth.\n\nNow, it's surprising that we have to affirm this truth today. More than a quarter century after Madiba walked out of prison, I still have to stand here at a lecture and devote some time to saying that black people and white people and Asian people and Latin American people and women and men and gays and straights, that we are all human, that our differences are superficial, and that we should treat each other with care and respect. I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well established. But it turns out, as we're seeing in this recent drift into reactionary politics, that the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished. So we've got to constantly be on the lookout and fight for people who seek to elevate themselves by putting somebody else down.\n\nAnd by the way, we also have to actively resist - this is important, particularly in some countries in Africa like my own father's homeland; I've made this point before - we have to resist the notion that basic human rights like freedom to dissent, or the right of women to fully participate in the society, or the right of minorities to equal treatment, or the rights of people not to be beat up and jailed because of their sexual orientation - we have to be careful not to say that somehow, well, that doesn't apply to us, that those are Western ideas rather than universal imperatives.\n\nAgain, Madiba, he anticipated things. He knew what he was talking about. In 1964, before he received the sentence that condemned him to die in prison, he explained from the dock that, \"The Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.\" In other words, he didn't say well, those books weren't written by South Africans so I just - I can't claim them. No, he said that's part of my inheritance.\n\nThat's part of the human inheritance. That applies here in this country, to me, and to you. And that's part of what gave him the moral authority that the apartheid regime could never claim, because he was more familiar with their best values than they were. He had read their documents more carefully than they had. And he went on to say, \"Political division based on color is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one color group by another.\" That's Nelson Mandela speaking in 1964, when I was three years old.\n\nWhat was true then remains true today. Basic truths do not change. It is a truth that can be embraced by the English, and by the Indian, and by the Mexican and by the Bantu and by the Luo and by the American. It is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion - that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. That we see ourselves in other people. That we can recognize common hopes and common dreams. And it is a truth that is incompatible with any form of discrimination based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation. And it is a truth that, by the way, when embraced, actually delivers practical benefits, since it ensures that a society can draw upon the talents and energy and skill of all its people. And if you doubt that, just ask the French football team that just won the World Cup. Because not all of those folks - not all of those folks look like Gauls to me. But they're French. They're French.\n\nEmbracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities. Madiba never stopped being proud of his tribal heritage. He didn't stop being proud of being a black man and being a South African.\n\nBut he believed, as I believe, that you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that you're a little insecure about your heritage if you've got to put somebody else's heritage down. Yeah, that's right. Don't you get a sense sometimes - again, I'm ad-libbing here - that these people who are so intent on putting people down and puffing themselves up that they're small-hearted, that there's something they're just afraid of.\n\nMadiba knew that we cannot claim justice for ourselves when it's only reserved for some. Madiba understood that we can't say we've got a just society simply because we replaced the color of the person on top of an unjust system, so the person looks like us even though they're doing the same stuff, and somehow now we've got justice. That doesn't work. It's not justice if now you're on top, so I'm going to do the same thing that those folks were doing to me and now I'm going to do it to you. That's not justice. \"I detest racialism,\" he said, \"whether it comes from a black man or a white man.\"\n\nNow, we have to acknowledge that there is disorientation that comes from rapid change and modernization, and the fact that the world has shrunk, and we're going to have to find ways to lessen the fears of those who feel threatened. In the West's current debate around immigration, for example, it's not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you're a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home. Those are legitimate things and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly. But that can't be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion. There's got to be some consistency. And we can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognize that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child.\n\nThird, Madiba reminds us that democracy is about more than just elections.\n\nWhen he was freed from prison, Madiba's popularity - well, you couldn't even measure it. He could have been president for life. Am I wrong? Who was going to run against him? I mean, Ramaphosa was popular, but come on. Plus he was a young - he was too young. Had he chose, Madiba could have governed by executive fiat, unconstrained by check and balances. But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new Constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom.\n\nNo individual - not Mandela, not Obama - are entirely immune to the corrupting influences of absolute power, if you can do whatever you want and everyone's too afraid to tell you when you're making a mistake. No one is immune from the dangers of that.\n\nMandela understood this. He said, \"Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.\" He understood it's not just about who has the most votes. It's also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work.\n\nSo we have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets 90 percent of the vote because all the opposition is locked up - - or can't get on TV, is a democracy. Democracy depends on strong institutions and it's about minority rights and checks and balances, and freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press, and the right to protest and petition the government, and an independent judiciary, and everybody having to follow the law.\n\nAnd yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. I know, I promise. But the efficiency that's offered by an autocrat, that's a false promise. Don't take that one, because it leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual and not the other way around. And it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real.\n\nSo for those of us who are interested in strengthening democracy, let's also stop - it's time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world's capitals and the centers of power and to start focusing more on the grassroots, because that's where democratic legitimacy comes from. Not from the top down, not from abstract theories, not just from experts, but from the bottom up. Knowing the lives of those who are struggling.\n\nAs a community organizer, I learned as much from a laid-off steel worker in Chicago or a single mom in a poor neighborhood that I visited as I learned from the finest economists in the Oval Office. Democracy means being in touch and in tune with life as it's lived in our communities, and that's what we should expect from our leaders, and it depends upon cultivating leaders at the grassroots who can help bring about change and implement it on the ground and can tell leaders in fancy buildings, this isn't working down here.\n\nAnd to make democracy work, Madiba shows us that we also have to keep teaching our children, and ourselves - and this is really hard - to engage with people not only who look different but who hold different views. This is hard.\n\nMost of us prefer to surround ourselves with opinions that validate what we already believe. You notice the people who you think are smart are the people who agree with you. Funny how that works. But democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you - because they're white, or because they're male - that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters.\n\nMadiba, he lived this complexity. In prison, he studied Afrikaans so that he could better understand the people who were jailing him. And when he got out of prison, he extended a hand to those who had jailed him, because he knew that they had to be a part of the democratic South Africa that he wanted to build. \"To make peace with an enemy,\" he wrote, \"one must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one's partner.\"\n\nSo those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether it's on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable. You can't expect to get 100 percent of what you want all the time; sometimes, you have to compromise. That doesn't mean abandoning your principles, but instead it means holding on to those principles and then having the confidence that they're going to stand up to a serious democratic debate. That's how America's Founders intended our system to work - that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and proof it would be possible to arrive at a basis for common ground.\n\nAnd I should add for this to work, we have to actually believe in an objective reality. This is another one of these things that I didn't have to lecture about. You have to believe in facts. Without facts, there is no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it's going to be hard for us to cooperate. I can find common ground for those who oppose the Paris Accords because, for example, they might say, well, it's not going to work, you can't get everybody to cooperate, or they might say it's more important for us to provide cheap energy for the poor, even if it means in the short term that there's more pollution.\n\nAt least I can have a debate with them about that and I can show them why I think clean energy is the better path, especially for poor countries, that you can leapfrog old technologies. I can't find common ground if somebody says climate change is just not happening, when almost all of the world's scientists tell us it is. I don't know where to start talking to you about this. If you start saying it's an elaborate hoax, I don't know what to - - where do we start?\n\nUnfortunately, too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in state-sponsored propaganda; we see it in internet driven fabrications, we see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment, we see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they're caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be if you caught them lying they'd be like, \"Oh man.\" Now they just keep on lying.\n\nBy the way, this is what I think Mama Gra\u00e7a was talking about in terms of maybe some sense of humility that Madiba felt, like sometimes just basic stuff, me not completely lying to people seems pretty basic, I don't think of myself as a great leader just because I don't completely make stuff up. You'd think that was a base line. Anyway, we see it in the promotion of anti-intellectualism and the rejection of science from leaders who find critical thinking and data somehow politically inconvenient.\n\nAnd, as with the denial of rights, the denial of facts runs counter to democracy, it could be its undoing, which is why we must zealously protect independent media; and we have to guard against the tendency for social media to become purely a platform for spectacle, outrage, or disinformation; and we have to insist that our schools teach critical thinking to our young people, not just blind obedience.\n\nWhich, I'm sure you are thankful for, leads to my final point: we have to follow Madiba's example of persistence and of hope.\n\nIt is tempting to give in to cynicism: to believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back; that the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the 90s, now you are hearing people talk about end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strong man. We have to resist that cynicism.\n\nBecause, we've been through darker times, we've been in lower valleys and deeper valleys. Yes, by the end of his life, Madiba embodied the successful struggle for human rights, but the journey was not easy, it wasn't pre-ordained. The man went to prison for almost three decades. He split limestone in the heat, he slept in a small cell, and was repeatedly put in solitary confinement. And I remember talking to some of his former colleagues saying how they hadn't realized when they were released, just the sight of a child, the idea of holding a child, they had missed - it wasn't something available to them, for decades.\n\nAnd yet his power actually grew during those years - and the power of his jailers diminished, because he knew that if you stick to what's true, if you know what's in your heart, and you're willing to sacrifice for it, even in the face of overwhelming odds, that it might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen in the next week, it might not even happen in your lifetime.\n\nThings may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might, not the other way around, ultimately, the better story can win out and as strong as Madiba's spirit may have been, he would not have sustained that hope had he been alone in the struggle, part of buoyed him up was that he knew that each year, the ranks of freedom fighters were replenishing, young men and women, here in South African, in the ANC and beyond; black and Indian and white, from across the countryside, across the continent, around the world, who in those most difficult days would keep working on behalf of his vision.\n\nAnd that's what we need right now, we don't just need one leader, we don't just need one inspiration, what we badly need right now is that collective spirit. And, I know that those young people, those hope carriers are gathering around the world. Because history shows that whenever progress is threatened, and the things we care about most are in question, we should heed the words of Robert Kennedy - spoken here in South Africa, he said, \"Our answer is the world's hope: it is to rely on youth. It's to rely on the spirit of the young.\"\n\nSo, young people, who are in the audience, who are listening, my message to you is simple, keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world. Mandela said, \"Young people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom.\" Now is a good time to be aroused. Now is a good time to be fired up.\n\nAnd, for those of us who care about the legacy that we honor here today - about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body - we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my Foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madiba's values, who are poised to lead the way.\n\nPeople like Abaas Mpindi, a journalist from Uganda, who founded the Media Challenge Initiative, to help other young people get the training they need to tell the stories that the world needs to know.\n\nPeople like Caren Wakoli, an entrepreneur from Kenya, who founded the Emerging Leaders Foundation to get young people involved in the work of fighting poverty and promoting human dignity.\n\nPeople like Enock Nkulanga, who directs the African Children's mission, which helps children in Uganda and Kenya get the education that they need and then in his spare time, Enock advocates for the rights of children around the globe, and founded an organization called LeadMinds Africa, which does exactly what it says.\n\nYou meet these people, you talk to them, they will give you hope. They are taking the baton, they know they can't just rest on the accomplishments of the past, even the accomplishments of those as momentous as Nelson Mandela's. They stand on the shoulders of those who came before, including that young black boy born 100 years ago, but they know that it is now their turn to do the work.\n\nMadiba reminds us that: \"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.\" Love comes more naturally to the human heart, let's remember that truth. Let's see it as our North Star, let's be joyful in our struggle to make that truth manifest here on earth so that in 100 years from now, future generations will look back and say, \"they kept the march going, that's why we live under new banners of freedom.\"", "Much of our appreciation of a TV series and its narrative stems from the quality of its soundtrack. We're as much music lovers as we are screen enthusiasts and when 'Hallelujah' comes over the top of Marissa's final words in The O.C. or 'Chasing Cars' sounds Denny's demise in Grey's Anatomy, the soundtrack precedes the show -- at that moment, the screenplay is at the command of its melodies.\n\nFrom the brazen, culturally erudite chimes of Breaking Bad to the quirky musical joyride of Freaks & Geeks, we've dug into the archives to unearth the greatest ever soundtracks to have hit our TV screens.\n\nThe O.C.\n\nFor the creator of seminal American teen drama, The O.C., the soundtrack was always intended to be an extra character -- the added personality that lined a narrative of hedonism and survival. Josh Schwartz was a screenwriting genius but he also had his finger on the pulse musically and at just the right moment, the melodies would arrive to enrich and articulate beyond the characters' acting.\n\nThere wouldn't be any accuracy to this list without including an old favourite, a cult-classic that swung the television industry upon its advent. Twin Peaks was a gamechanger for its quirkiness and sheer oddity, and much of its acclaim can be attributed to its soundtrack. With 'Laura Palmer's Theme' at the fore, the music of Twin Peaks has ruptured its square screen boundaries and inspired music tastemakers the world over. The likes of Moby, Sky Ferreira and DJ Shadow have dipped their hands into the Twin Peaks goodie bag.\n\nThe moment: Twin Peaks' entrancing opening theme, courtesy of genius composer Angelo Badalamenti.\n\nGripping as it was disconcerting, Breaking Bad will go down as one of the greatest television creations. Never have we witnessed the muscle of criminality exercised to such an extent. Walter White was a felon who induced the plights of his co-conspirators as he became a devil numb to his own sorcery. To satisfy such penetrating screenplay, the soundtrack must be carefully sculpted -- and so it was, country and latin-doused hip-hop gratifying the show's dustiness and culture.\n\nThe moment: TV on the Radio's 'DLZ' intensifies a barefaced conversation between White and some delinquents.\n\nFreaks & Geeks kickstarted the careers of James Franco, Jason Segel and Seth Rogen, it was the TV show you'd come home and watch after school before mum and dad stormed through the door. Across a lifespan of one season and 18 episodes, over 120 songs were sampled. It was here that punters were delighted to discover Van Halen's 'Runnin' with the Devil', Cheap Trick's 'Gonna Raise Hell' and Supertramp's 'Take the Long Way Home'. A true rock'n'roll experience.\n\nWhen The Duffer Brothers conceptualised Stranger Things, they wanted to revolutionise the modern soundtrack, hoping to create an unnerving narrative and embellish it with an apocalyptic musical partner. As the Demogorgons took control, S U R V I V E impelled their oracular command and while the soundtrack emerged dark and ominous for the most part, there were times for respite -- The Clash, Joy Division and New Order facilitating their creations.\n\nThe moment: The Police's 'Every Breath You Take' rings aloud at the final Snowball dance.\n\nThe Master of None soundtrack is moulded by a group of intellects, of people who truly know their audience and how they will react with every pull. The music could've been thematically dense so as to challenge their punters but creator Aziz Ansari created an atmosphere of predictability. Each scene was matched with an equally logical song. As Ansari repents the missed opportunity that is Francesca's love, the murmurs of Soft Cell's 'Say Hello, Wave Goodbye' are heard. As the song plays out, there's no dialogue and Ansari retreats further and further into his Uber passenger seat. Pure mastery.\n\nThe moment: The Vengaboys' 'We Like to Party!' is mockingly revived during a closed-restaurant dance party.\n\nThe Golden Globe-winning The Handmaid's Tale tells the tale of Gilead, a totalitarian society in the United States which treats women as property of the state. As an environmental disaster and a plummeting birth rate confront the community, women become subjects of sexual slavery. In a utopian world there are moments of silence and in The Handmaid's Tale, the music fills the void where dialogue falls short. Across two gripping seasons, punters are treated to everything from Bob Marley to Jay Reatard.\n\nThe moment: As handmaids process their impending execution, Kate Bush's poignant 'This Woman's Work' comes into the fray.\n\nTrue Blood marked a valiant shift in the soundtrack evolution. Shaping the music of a vampire drama could be perceived a simple task -- juxtapose unnerving melodies with soundtracks of comfort, then repeat. But True Blood knocked pre-conceptions out of the park, fusing everything from Lucinda Williams to Eagles of Death Metal and Leona Lewis together to keep punters guessing. Truly stellar.\n\nThe moment: Billie Holiday turns a gruesome moment into something elegant as Lorena Krasiki fells her lover Bill Compton in season three.\n\nGrey's Anatomy was a helipad for the next wave of indie artists. Tegan and Sara dropped in with their track 'Where Does the Good Go' before getting their break while the careers of Roisin Murphy and Anna Nalick also gained momentum from respective samplings. There was an element of cheese to this soundtrack that made it somewhat irksome but you can't deny the moment everyone got teary when 'Chasing Cars' came to the fore or while Ed Sheeran's 'Kiss Me' perfectly evoked Adele's death.\n\nThe moment: Has to be Snow Patrol's 'Chasing Cars' arising for Denny's death scene.", "The Constitutional Court of Romania (CCR) on Tuesday took up a constitutionality objection filed by the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL) and People's Movement Party (PMP) over amendments to Law 393/2004 on the statutes of local elected officials.\n\nAccording to the amended law adopted by the Senate, the mandates of mayors, county council members and county council chairmen do not end in case the party on whose lists they were elected merges with another political party.\n\nThe law has been challenged at the CCR by 80 PMP, PNL and non-affiliated MPs.\n\nPMP leader Eugen Tomac has stated that the legislative act is undemocratic and anti-constitutional.\n\n\"Adopting a law that would secure the mandate of mayors, county council members and county council chairmen even if the party on whose lists they were elected merges with another political party is abusive, inspired by totalitarian ideology, and has only one target: the PMP,\" PMP President Eugen Tomac was stating.\n\nHe was saying that the PSD has modified this law for a single purpose: targeting the PMP, for the PSD to get back the UNPR councillors that became PMP members after the merger.\n\n\"I'm convinced that the story of the merger between PMP and UNPR also ends through this challenge at the CCR. The UNPR has exhausted all their means of attack, even though two years ago we had a merger conference unanimously adopted. Many of the former UNPR leaders, seeing that they did not attain their objective of entering Parliament through the PMP, denounced the merger, something that created difficulties in the process of absorbing the UNPR, and subsequently they negotiated with the PSD that the current majority should pass a law tailor-made against the PMP. (...) I'm convinced that the CCR will not compromise itself and will judge fairly our challenge, because the will of two political parties cannot be modified through a law passed in order to recruit some local elected officials. For PSD it's sufficient that they took back the former UNPR MPs [that were] on PMP's lists, the other colleagues must remain where they are, to continue their activity within the PMP. (...) The law on parliamentary parties is being infringed, as well as the democratic principle of association between parties. As long as there was a will unanimously expressed by two political entities, the state can't come and say that what we decided is not alright,\" Eugen Tomac said.\n\nOn June 20, the Senate - as the decisive body - adopted a legislative initiative stating that the mandates of mayors, county council members and county council chairmen do not cease in case the parties on whose lists they were elected merge with other political parties.\n\nThe bill amends Law no.393/2004 on the statute of local elected officials, in the sense that one's capacity as local councillor or county councillor does not cease before the normal expiration of the mandate if the holder of the said capacity loses his/her capacity as member of the political party or national minority's organisation on whose list of candidates he/she was elected, with the exception of political parties that merged, in which case the councillor becomes independent. In the current form of the law, Article 9 reads: \"One's capacity as local councillor or county councillor legally ceases, before the expiration of the normal length of the mandate, in the following cases: 1) losing capacity as member of the political party or national minorities' organisation on whose list he/she was elected.\"\n\nLikewise, another amendment that PSD has brought to Article 15 reads: \"one's capacity as mayor and county council chairman legally ceases, before the expiration of the normal length of the mandate, in the following cases: the loss, via resignation, of the capacity as member of the political party or national minorities' organisation on whose list of candidates he/she was elected, with the exception of political parties that merged, in which case the mayor becomes independent.\"", "Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion And Defiance Of Prince Charles\n\nTom Bower\n\nWilliam Collins \u00a320\n\nRating:\n\nTom Bower is the undisputed Witchfinder General of contemporary biographers. Before his next subject is led quivering into the dock, Bower tends to don his black cap, just to save time.\n\nThis year's accused is Prince Charles. A handy summary of the charges against him can be obtained by turning to 'Charles, Prince of Wales' in the book's index, and then looking under 'Character'. The categories listed are: refusal to accept blame; self-doubt; disloyalty; victims of; dislike of criticism/dissenting views; scapegoats; self-pity; intolerance/bad temper; sense of superiority; grudges; selfishness; resentment of Diana; derogatory comments about Diana; on himself; discourteousness. Not a single redeeming characteristic is allowed a look-in.\n\nMost of Bower's charges against the Prince of Wales are to do with his preciousness and self-pampering\n\nIn his introduction, Bower acknowledges that 'During my research, I inevitably encountered a large number of different opinions', adding: 'All are reflected in this book.' Oh yes? As that index entry suggests, the proportion of space given to the antis and to the pros is roughly 100 to 1.\n\nThe accusations keep tumbling down, drowning out the handful of words in his defence. He is, according to the Witchfinder General, 'the most unpopular heir for generations... shame and guilt seem foreign to him... self-destructive... thin-skinned and over-eager to find fault with others, especially his parents... a bad enemy...' and so on, and on, and on.\n\nOn those rare occasions when a sentence kicks off with a compliment, you can be sure that Bower is just dutifully trudging up the hill, all the better to enjoy the slide back down again. 'The legacy of Charles's noble causes, good intentions and interest in individuals,' begins one sentence but then it continues, 'has been tarnished by his addiction to luxury, his financial mismanagement, his disloyalty to professional supporters and the torrid relationships with his family.'\n\nMost of Bower's charges against the Prince of Wales are to do with his preciousness and self-pampering. He employs four valets, so that there will always be two around to help him change his clothes, which he does up to five times a day. When he stays with someone, a truck precedes him, bearing his own bed and linen, his own lavatory seat, Kleenex Velvet loo paper (oooh!), and two Scottish landscapes. At home, retired Indian servicemen are 'deployed to prowl through the undergrowth at night with torches and handpick slugs from the leaves of plants'.\n\nThis is the stuff of comedy, but Bower has no sense of humour, so he treats each fresh absurdity as a hanging offence. He is a stranger to nuance and understatement, which means that everything is black and white, or, more accurately, black and blacker.\n\nIn Bower's version of events, Charles and Camilla never just 'say' anything: instead, they scream, growl, wail or shriek. A film of the book would have to be made in Sensurround. Favourite Bower words are bombshell, earthquake, torpedo, knife-edge, frenzy, deluge, fury, and misery. When Charles is not being propelled to the edge of the precipice, he is pouring fuel on to the flames. Anyone reading a page of Rebel Prince sight unseen would imagine they had been handed the latest thriller by Andy McNab rather than a biography of the woebegone 69-year-old heir to the throne.\n\nLike his father, Prince Charles has never been shy of voicing his opinions on issues great and small. Famously, he is for foxhunting, organic farming and homeopathy and against modern architecture, GM food and rationalism. Most people will find themselves in agreement with him on some issues, and against him on others. But Bower manages to put a negative spin on all of them, whatever they are.\n\nFor instance, at the handover of Hong Kong, Charles, a vociferous supporter of the downtrodden people of Tibet, privately criticises the Chinese rulers as corrupt, ridiculing the Chinese army for 'an awful Soviet-style display' of goose-stepping. Fair enough: most decent people would think the same. But Bower can't resist adding: 'Charles appeared unaware that his host, President Jiang Zemin, was the architect of the phenomenal economic growth that had tripled China's average wages in 15 years and was transforming the country into a global power.' So what? Economic growth has nothing to do with the corruption and totalitarianism of which Charles was complaining. And if Charles had praised the Chinese regime, you can be sure Bower would have come down on him for sycophancy to dictators.\n\nYou're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't: such is the age-old method of the Witchfinder General. Being shown around a Wimpey housing development in Jarrow, the Prince complained about the way the company was fobbing off householders with shoddy street lamps, bricks and so forth. Does this mean the Prince was gallantly standing up for ordinary people against the mighty developers? Not for Bower; for him, it shows 'Charles's limited understanding of the commercial reality of Wimpey's standard housing estate'. Who would have thought that this champion of investigative journalism would be standing up for the cost-cutting ways of property developers?\n\nSimilarly, one might have thought that it was rather nice of Charles to look in on his tenants from time to time. But no: 'Some long-term employees who had been granted a home were obliged to receive a visit from Charles as a reminder of their place in the scheme of things; others were invited for dinner, or to a garden party at Highgrove. Lesser mortals received gifts.'\n\nEven William and Harry get it in the back. 'William and Kate chose to retreat to Norfolk, where they could preserve their privacy,' writes Bower. 'Some interpreted the move as confirmation that William was somewhat lazy and spoilt.'\n\nAlong with their father, William and Harry apparently 'performed half-heartedly, rather than as the natural focus, during moments of national celebration and crisis'. Yet if ever they were to become the focus, Bower would doubtless criticise them just as harshly for wanting to be the centre of attention.\n\nMuch of the book concerns Charles's ever-increasing array of charitable enterprises. Bower acknowledges that 'half a million children at the bottom of the social heap' have been helped by The Prince's Trust, but - needless to say - he can't bear to leave it at that. 'Critics questioned why Charles was competing with the more successful Duke of Edinburgh Award,' he claims, even though the two charities are very different; tellingly, he doesn't name these 'critics', perhaps because they are so thin on the ground.\n\nThe Prince's charities are reliant on vast donations from a motley crew of billionaires, most of them shady or vulgar or social-climbing, or all three at once. The more you give to each charity, the closer you get to sit to the Prince at the fundraising dinner. That is the deal. For \u00a3200,000, you are virtually allowed to sit on his lap. As if by magic, snobbery is transformed into philanthropy. It's coarse, but it works. Bower lists some marvellously Firbankian names who have shelled out for this privilege, including 'Pedro Pseudo, a Porcelanosa director' and 'Chrysanthi Lemos, the wife of a Greek ship-owner'. Sadly, Bower sometimes gets things wrong: Pedro's real surname is Pesudo. Still, the baroque humour of it all is lost beneath his sea of disapproval. He claims that the Prince's charities are 'bureaucratic, expensive, overmanned and increasingly ineffective', but I don't suppose these gripes would hold much water for those whose lives have been transformed.\n\nMuch of the book is a slow trudge across well-trodden ground, both sublime and ridiculous, from the death of Diana to Fergie's toe-sucking. Bower presents interesting new information about the sudden cessation of the trial of Paul Burrell, and argues convincingly that Her Majesty was leant upon. But somehow his prose is so hyper-charged and his tone so relentlessly accusatory that it is hard to see the wood for the trees. Nor does his principal source, the one-time 'media consultant' and former assistant private secretary Mark Bolland, fill one with much confidence. In Bower's opinion, Bolland 'offered loyalty and true friendship, especially to Camilla', yet this devoted figure went on to dish the dirt on a weekly basis in the News of the World.", "Treason. What started out as the hyperbolic ramblings of a person on the far fringe of the left with Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan, has made its way into the liberal media as a whole. In the hours since President Trump's press conference in Helsinki, the liberal media's mouth-foaming rage had only grown worse. And on Tuesday's CNN Tonight, the network's presidential historian declared there was little doubt about it: The President committed treason.\n\nThe ridiculous segment began with host Don Lemon reading from the Constitution and framing the definition of treason:\n\nArticle III in section three of the Constitution says this, \"Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\" So no president has ever been charged with treason, Douglas. Do you believe the President's actions fall anywhere within that definition?\n\nCNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley was adamant that what President Trump did on Monday was a threat to the U.S. \"[T]he spirit of what Trump did is clearly treasonous. It's a betrayal of the United States. He threw our U.S. intelligence services, flushed them away and it came off as being a puppet of Putin,\" he declared. \"So the word treason like impeachment, like obstruction of justice, are going to be out there in public discourse louder and longer right now.\"\n\n\"But it's all going to come down in the end to what the Mueller investigation unearths. But certainly, people are going to say there's the taint of treason around this White House,\" he added.\n\nBut Brinkley was disheartened. He lamented that the charge of treason probably wouldn't stick to Trump due to technicalities:\n\nThe problem with the enemy aiding and abetting, Don, is that Russia is not officially right now considered an enemy of the United States. But we also know they had a cyber-attack on us. So Donald Trump's got kind of the slippery slope of legal language in his favor.\n\nA few minutes later, Brinkley asserted that \"the bottom line\" was that Trump \"loves Vladimir Putin\" and totalitarianism. \"He doesn't mine the trappings of, you know, calling press the enemy of the people. He doesn't seem to promote democracy abroad or free and fair elections because he hasn't read and he's largely ignorant of history,\" he spat.\n\nHe then suggested that Trump's constant claims of innocence in the matter of collusion was him \"revealing\" evidence that he was guilty. \"How many more times does he have the say the word collusion? That's probably because he feels he colluded,\" he proclaimed.\n\nBrinkley then mocked Trump for only energizing the Mueller probe by flashing that guilt. \"But nobody now is thinking that Mueller is on a witch hunt,\" he boasted. \"Actually, we're recognizing more and more what a great service he's doing that we have a backup plan to at least try to get to the bottom of what President Trump was up to in undermining our election.\"\n\nThis was not a discussion about the news of the day; this was political opponents of a president wringing their hands in anticipation and excitement for his fall.", "A good character creator is like a powerful first scene, or a good first page in a book. And while there have been many takes on ways to make a character, Jagged Alliance 2 is still far and away one of my favourites.\n\nJagged Alliance and its sequel were born in an era where there was plenty of quality turn based strategy. It was the era of X-COM, the highs of Civilization 2 and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, the beloved Heroes of Might and Magic series, and countless WW2 and Civil War-inspired wargames.\n\nJagged Alliance had more of a mercenary flavour to it. The original game introduced you to Metavira, an island that has been turned into a totalitarian state by Lucas Santino. A nuclear experiment genetically altered some of the trees on the island, making their sap highly profitable for medical purposes, and you've been hired by a pair of researchers to retake the island by force.\n\nThe original map of Metavira from JA1.\n\nThe original game was developed by Montreal-based developed MadLab software, with Canadian compatriots Sir-Tech picking up the mantle for the sequel. In JA2, the fictional country of Arulco has been overthrown by the dictator Deidranna, who framed the previous monarch for the death of her father. Enrico Chivaldori hires the player to save Arulco from her tyranny, and thus the game begins.\n\nPrincipally, the Jagged Alliance series is a game about two layers: the tactical management of your mercenaries, juggling their strengths, weaknesses, loadouts, positioning and personalities; and balancing resources, not only the finances required to hire mercenaries to begin with, but their ongoing upkeep, their strategic deployment between missions, training, and fending off attacks from the AI's hired guns.\n\nThe first Jagged Alliance didn't give the player an avatar. Instead, you were the faceless connection to the Association of International Mercenaries, Incorporated, otherwise referred to as A.I.M.\n\nThe opening I.M.P. screen, where your underlying stats are determined.\n\nJA2 went a step further, giving the player a controllable character in-game that would have their own personality, attributes and underlying stats. Like most games of the era, there was little in the way of cosmetic customisation: a few voice lines, your choice of name and gender, and a handful of portraits to choose from.\n\nBut the fun part lay in the stats: rather than simply giving you a bunch of sliders to toy with, JA2 gave you a personality test.\n\nAfter using the XEP624 activation code - it never changes - the game gives takes you through a series of 16 questions as part of a faux psych profile. Three of the questions are just for shits and giggles, whereas the rest determine the underlying skills and personality of your character.\n\nPersonality doesn't have a huge affect on gameplay - an arrogant personality could have negative effects with interacting with NPCs, but you can negate that by just having a dedicated face for your group of mercenaries. Skills, on the other hand, can have a huge impact. Throwing gives you a better chance to hit; lockpicking is an obvious plus, while electronics improves your chance to disarm electronic traps, remote detonators, and so forth.\n\nMartial Arts is a neat one: you can knock out damaged enemies with a roundhouse kick that doesn't miss. Of course, the fun of all this is that the game doesn't tell you what answers unlock what skills, and the manual didn't offer any tips either. It was just one of those things people discovered by trial and error, with gamemags helping out back in the day as essential guides for those without internet access.\n\nThe quiz was laced with the same kind of Die Hard-esque humour as the original. For instance, how would you respond to rustlings of a potential robber in your house? Would you grab a knife and wander down slowly, or would you grab a shotgun and start shooting holes into the floor?\n\nA breakdown of a character's attributes, including their morale, inventory, HP and armour, the inventory available in a particular sector, and the overall status of a mercenary's contract.\n\nEach question had at least four answers. Some answers in a particular quiz would net you a skill, while others would impact your personality. You can also develop particular phobias, like nervousness, claustrophobia or psychosis. Forgetfulness can be a right pain: characters in turn-based mode could lose a single action point, up to all of their action points (although once it happens, you're good for another 200 moves).\n\nIn a game where inventory management is crucial - because each merc can only carry so much - having bonuses like Camouflage can save crucial weight and space. Positive team members also don't get dismayed as much when someone retreats from a battle, which can be a lifesaver when you're dealing with limited cover.\n\nMany games still deploy a range of hidden stats, traits that affect the player but can't be directly chosen for one reason or another. JA2's method was a neat way of involving the player in that process, while allowing for some cheeky writing as well.\n\nJA2 had a couple of short, pre-rendered intro sequences - tanks blowing up a village, money changing hands at a shadowy cafe, people wasting behind bars - but the I.M.P. quiz was the game's true opening. It was a neat spin on character creation, and one of the many feathers that under JA2's clever cap.", "MANILA - Several provisions in the draft constitution for a federal government could weaken democracy in the country, former Chief Justice Hilario Davide said Wednesday.\n\nDavide questioned provisions in the proposed federal constitution which requires top government officials to have a college diploma and another that will require the transitory president and vice president to run under the same ticket.\n\nThese will disadvantage independent candidates, said the former chief justice, who helped write the 1987 Constitution that the federal charter seeks to supplant.\n\n\"The biggest flaw here would be really that what is created is a weak democracy with ingredients of totalitarian and fascism,\" he told ANC's Headstart.\n\n\"It is a weak democracy because the protection granted to it would really be inequality and you would have massive restructuring of the entire machinery of the government,\" he said.\n\nHaving 4 federal courts in place of the current Supreme Court may complicate the judiciary and will not help in resolving pending cases, he said.\n\nThe appointment of justices will also become more politicized as there will no longer be a Judicial and Bar Council that will shortlist nominees for the president's consideration, he said.\n\n\"Why create other courts with 4 chief justices now when actually, if you want, you can only increase the membership of the Supreme Court now and then assign to certain divisions specific tasks,\" he said.", "President Trump claims he misspoke Monday, accidentally leaving out the word \"not\" when he said it was beyond his imagination to understand \"why it would\" be Russia that interfered with the 2016 election.\n\nHe claimed he was not taking Vladimir Putin's word over the assessment of the American intelligence community, even though that's exactly what he's tried to do for the past two years.\n\nThe \"misspoke\" excuse is not credible, but sadly, some people will choose to believe it.\n\nThat's the way our politics works these days. People get the news they want to hear and dismiss anything that makes them uncomfortable as \"fake.\" With his embrace of a dictator, Trump may have upset members of the political establishment on both sides of the Atlantic, but he has not lost the support of people who matter most to him.\n\nSTRONG REPUBLICAN SUPPORT\n\nTrump's favorability rating is only 43 percent overall, according to the Gallup polling agency, but it's 89 percent among Republicans, which is close to the highest approval rating that any president has had at this stage in their administration among members of their own party.\n\nRepublican office holders, especially those who will face the voters in November, are well aware of these numbers and have been very careful in their criticism. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, from Maine's 2nd District, issued a short statement Monday that omitted Trump's name, praised his diplomacy but added \"we must also recognize the consensus that Russia did try to interfere in our election.\"\n\nRelated Read more Portland Press Herald editorials\n\nBut the consensus is that our adversary did more than try. Thirteen Russians have been indicted in a disinformation scheme that created fraudulent organizations and pumped false reports into individual swing voters' social media accounts. Just last week, a dozen Russian intelligence agents were indicted for allegedly stealing information from computers belonging to the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign and using it to help Trump.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee found that Russian hackers tried to get into the computers of election officials in all 50 states, and succeeded in some of them. They didn't just try to interfere - they interfered.\n\nSen. Susan Collins issued a statement that called Trump's position \"untenable,\" which means \"not able to be maintained,\" but she did not say what would happen if he tries to maintain it.\n\nCollins has served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which, unlike its counterpart in the House, has produced a bipartisan report that tries to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016.\n\nHOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?\n\nBut it's really up to rank-and-file Republicans to decide how much they are willing to ignore. Will they continue to discount indictments from the Mueller investigation and make up conspiracy-theory fever dreams about a deep-state coup, or will they reflect on the way that a totalitarian dictator was able to manipulate us from the other side of the world?\n\nUnless Democrats start winning elections, Republicans control the three branches of the federal government, so they have a responsibility to look beyond the partisan talking points they are getting from their favorite media outlets.\n\nThat Russia tried to swing the election for Trump is not up for debate. Why Trump would want to keep that quiet is still an open question. It's one that Trump supporters should be asking themselves right now.\n\nfiled under: conspiracy theories, Donald Trump, Our View, russia, vladimir putin Related Stories Latest Articles Recipes Recipe: Original Marjorie Standish Melt-in-Your-Mouth Blueberry Cake Politics Lawmakers await details on LePage's plan for hospital tax to fund Medicaid expansion Letters Letter to the editor: Story omitted vital details of hearing on new homeless shelter Letters Letter to the editor: When it comes to Trump, either side with democracy or enable fascism Letters Letter to the editor: Connecting Trump speech to hacking of emails was speculative, silly Want the news vital to Maine?

After the Budget, Mishal Husain on Radio Four's Today programme asked him eight times to tell us what his massive spending would cost in extra debt interest. Eight times he refused to answer.\n\nBut in politics, as in so much else, the devil is in the detail.

But responsibility means compromising with financial reality, and that is something Mr McDonnell is completely unprepared to do.\n\nFor careful readers, though, there are clues to Mr McDonnell's values in his book. Every now and again, amid all the pious flannel, his language lurches into the fire and brimstone of the hard Left.\n\nThe foreign country he mentions most enthusiastically is Venezuela. Mr McDonnell thinks it is a disgrace that the Blair government failed to back the 'democratically elected government of [Hugo] Chavez', and he has warm words for the Marxist bully's 'real world economics' , which have apparently created 'alternatives to the market economy'.\n\nTen years on, of course, we know where Chavez's policies have led: political repression, appalling violence and an inflation rate that currently stands at almost 800 per cent. If this is the 'alternative' that Mr McDonnell wants for Britain, no wonder almost all copies of his book have strangely vanished.\n\nMcDonnell is a fan of the late Hugo Chavez, here greeting Muammar Gaddafi\n\nBut that is not all. Comically, he calls for the establishment of a 'Ministry for Peace at the heart of government', while simultaneously demanding that Britain scrap all its nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd this is the man who wants to control our defences at a time when North Korea has developed a missile capable of hitting London.\n\nWhat else? Nationalisation of the railways, obviously, though there is nothing about how and why Whitehall would run them more efficiently.\n\nHe wants a 'citizen's income, that allows everyone to enjoy a reasonable standard of living', whether they work or not. I wonder who would pay for that? And he wants to scrap the union reforms of the Eighties so that 'workers can challenge decisions on jobs and production', which would mean anarchy on the factory floor and paralysis in the boardroom.\n\nAnything else? Well, how about 'redistributing wealth from rich to poor' in Britain?\n\nAnd I almost forgot: he calls for a 'massive redistribution of resources and technology from richer to poor countries', too, which implies a 'massive' increase in our foreign aid budget, to use his own term, if Labour won power.\n\nBack in 2007, this, unsurprisingly, fell on deaf ears. But how times have changed!\n\nMcDonnell is a fan of 'direct action' and 'insurrection to instil fear in the rich elite'\n\nToday, Mr McDonnell's book looks less like the mad fantasy of a superannuated student- union socialist, and more like a chillingly plausible formula for disaster. For behind the pious waffle, the fundamental fact about Labour's Shadow Chancellor is that he is far, far to the Left of every single one of his predecessors.\n\nNine men have served as Labour chancellor since the party entered government in the 1920s, starting with Philip Snowden and moving through the likes of Jim Callaghan and Roy Jenkins in the Sixties to Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.\n\nIn policy, temperament and ideological background, none was remotely close to Mr McDonnell. This is a man who told the BBC's Andrew Marr that he gets his economic ideas from Karl Marx's book Das Kapital.\n\nFirst published in 1867, this was the book that inspired Communist revolutionaries such as Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, who were responsible for the deaths of millions. Indeed, in Who's Who, McDonnell listed 'fermenting [sic] the overthrow of capitalism' among his hobbies.\n\nAnd after the financial crisis of 2007-8, which caused so much misery and anxiety, he bragged that he had been 'waiting for [it] for a generation'. Mr McDonnell certainly likes his politics with a violent edge -- just like his friends in the IRA, whose 'bombs and bullets and sacrifice', he said in 2003, should be publicly honoured.\n\nJust look, for example, at what he said before the 2015 election, when he called for 'direct action' and 'insurrection to instil fear in the rich elite'. And read his words in the anarchist journal Strike! -- a publication that none of his Labour predecessors would ever have had in the house -- where he called himself 'the last Communist in Parliament'.\n\nHe ended with a chilling war cry. 'Words are not enough,' he wrote. 'The elite who still dine at the Ritz, shop at Fortnum & Mason and populate the company boards in the City . . . will only be fearful when our talk moves on to action.'\n\nRemember, this was not something Mr McDonnell wrote as a teenager or even as a student. He wrote those words in 2014, as a man of 62. They were not a joke. He meant every word.\n\nEven as Shadow Chancellor, Mr McDonnell has not been able to hide his ugly side. After the Grenfell Tower fire, he infamously claimed that the residents had been 'murdered' by the Conservative Government -- a statement that could hardly have been more likely to incite public anger.\n\nI have heard Labour supporters claim that the responsibilities of office would temper Mr McDonnell's extremism.\n\nWell, they failed to restrain his great hero Hugo Chavez, who silenced dissent, ruled by decree and turned his oil-rich country into an economic basket case. In any case, we know how Mr McDonnell would behave in office.\n\nIn the mid-Eighties he served as deputy leader and finance chairman of the Greater London Council (GLC). His record makes for grisly reading. Mr McDonnell was so extreme, so uncompromising, so determined to stoke confrontation with the Thatcher government, that even his Left-wing allies disowned him.\n\nAs one fellow GLC member put it: 'He was so far to the Left that I couldn't see him without a pair of binoculars.' Eventual ly his boss, Ken Livingstone, had to sack him. Imagine having that on your CV -- 'I was the one man in Britain too Left-wing for Ken Livingstone!'\n\nIt sounds comical. But now imagine John McDonnell walking into 11 Downing Street as the master of the nation's finances: the self-described heir of Marx and Lenin playing politics with the lives of millions. Few of us would be laughing then.\n\nIt is fashionable, I know, to complain about bankers and businesspeople. Yet if Corbyn and McDonnell began by launching an offensive against the City of London, as they promise, the consequences for millions of British families would be devastating.\n\nFor all the infantile rhetoric of the hard Left, the plain fact is that in the last tax year, the City and its allied financial services handed over tax receipts worth about \u00a372 billion. Just think what losing all that revenue would mean for schools, hospitals, roads and pensions.\n\nFor the past two years, Britain's banks and businesses have largely ignored Mr Corbyn, assuming that he would never win power and concentrating on the challenges of Brexit instead. But in the past few weeks, the City has woken up to the genuine possibility of a Corbyn government. Indeed, Morgan Stanley's warnings are merely a symptom of a growing panic.\n\nIn private, I have learned, senior bankers -- including the chief executive of one of the world's largest banks -- admit that their firms are contemplating moving assets out of this country, in order to protect investors, including millions of British pension-holders, from the impact of a far-Left government.\n\nIndeed, some senior bankers think a Corbyn government would be more damaging to Britain's economy than a no-deal Brexit, since it would have a devastating impact on our reputation as a place to do business. On Thursday night, Richard Sharp, a stalwart of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, warned that allowing Britain's debt to spiral out of control would endanger the nation's economic stability and prosperity.\n\nMany City figures believe that Sharp was issuing a thinly veiled warning about a free-spending Corbyn government. As he argued, more borrowing could put Britain at risk of a collapse similar to that of Venezuela, the economy so admired by Labour's leadership.\n\nIf Corbyn and McDonnell did come to power, I suspect three things would happen almost immediately. First, the pound would collapse as foreign investors lost confidence -- a scenario Mr McDonnell himself expects, since he told the Labour conference that he was preparing for a 'run on the pound'.\n\nSome of Mr McDonnell's chief enthusiasms -- Marxism, the IRA, 'mass insurrection' -- are kept under wraps\n\nSecond , there would be an immediate flight of companies, personnel and capital from the City of London, as major banks moved abroad to avoid the massive taxes and regulations imposed by a Corbyn government. So we could wave goodbye to a lot of those tax receipts straight away. And third, there would probably be what financial insiders call a 'gilts strike', with investors refusing to buy government bonds.\n\nThat would make it impossible for a Corbyn government to cover our existing spending -- let alone the gigantic new commitments they promise if they win power. All this, at a time when Britain is beginning to carve out a new role outside the EU, would be catastrophic, worse than the financial crisis of 2007-8, worse than the IMF bailout of Britain in 1976, and worse even, I think, than the onset of the Great Depression in 1931.\n\nHow would Mr McDonnell react? Would he step back from the brink? We know the answer. Based on his form at the GLC, as well as the record of his parliamentary career, he would press on. Every setback would be blamed on a conspiracy; every reverse attributed to traitors and plotters.\n\nNo doubt there would be more talk of direct action and insurrection. And it would end precisely where Mr McDonnell wants it to end, with violence in the streets.\n\nMr Corbyn is quite right, then. He and his friend are indeed a threat -- not just to our short-term living standards, but to our trading reputation, our economic future, our national security and the very fabric of our society.\n\nDoes Mr Corbyn understand what he is doing? I am not sure. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, and to assume that he is a fundamentally well-meaning man, albeit an unusual ly stupid, incurious, deluded and vain one. But Mr McDonnell is different.\n\nI think he knows precisely what he is doing. And if this cold, hard, dangerous man ever gets his hands on our national finances, I genuinely fear for the future of our country.", "Obama's support for gay marriage is a cynical cash grab that will lose him votes\n\nBy Thomas Fleming for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 11:27 EDT, 10 May 2012 | Updated: 12:47 EDT, 10 May 2012\n\nSoap opera: U.S. President Barack Obama has said that he supports gay marriage\n\nAmericans were shocked, absolutely shocked yesterday, when President Obama, after a long period of profound meditation, revealed to Robin Roberts that he does not oppose same-sex marriage.\n\nThis morning Roberts told her colleague George Stephanopoulos that she still gets chills just thinking about it!\n\nRoberts' girlish awe is more than justified by the clarity and brilliance of Obama's rhetoric: 'At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.'\n\nAll I can say is 'Gosh!'\n\nThe President never seems to be able to talk about anything, from sports to global warming, without making himself the center of the story.\n\n'I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think....'\n\nHe managed to put six degrees of subjectivity into what should have been a simple declarative sentence.\n\nAccording to the soap opera scripted by the White House, the President was hurried into making his confession by Joe Biden's reckless comments to the same effect. As the President later informed CBS, he and Biden had already made up their minds to endorse same-sex marriage, but Biden 'got ahead of his skis.'\n\nIt could be. The Vice President is, as we know, an utter and complete fool, but it is also quite possible that this little stunt was no accident.\n\nWith a gay marriage ban on the ballot in North Carolina, the administration's PR/fund-raising team had to dream up a plan by which they could get maximum publicity for their entirely predictable appeal to Hollywood and the gay Democrats of the country.\n\nWhy utterly predictable? Because Obama has always supported civil unions, which in the eyes of American law is exactly identical to marriage.\n\nSecular governments have absolutely nothing to do with either the sacrament of marriage, as understood by Catholics, or with the holy matrimony blessed by Protestant denominations.\n\nAll a government can do is to issue a cohabitation license, which is coupled with tax breaks, pension benefits, and all the other legal protections guaranteed to civil unions.\n\nPressure: Campaigners at a gay pride parade in Brazil hold a banner encouraging the President to take up plans to allow gay marriage\n\nObama--like most Republicans--has been making distinction without a difference. A less polite but more accurate word is that they are all lying\n\nBesides, way back in 1996 Obama said he supported same-sex marriage, and no one has ever doubted his committment to the homosexualist agenda.\n\nGays and homosexualism advocates make up an influential and lucrative part of the spectrum in the Rainbow Coalition of the Democratic Party, and while they will not vote for Mitt Romney, they could refuse to give money and find something else to do on election day.\n\nThis sop to supporters has been described by Obama's shameless adulators as an act of 'moral leadership' and as putting the moral authority of his presidency behind gay marriage.\n\nIf the whole thing was a fake as the President has suggested, it is probably a serious political miscalculation, since he will lose more in votes than he will gain in donations from Gay Democratis. But, as I have always observed, Obama is not just a bad President but a poor politician.\n\nLesbians such as these could be able to get married in a Christian ceremony after Obama's declaration in support of same-sex marriages\n\nHere is one little fact they are missing. Marriage is by nature a relationship between a man and a woman.\n\nYou can engage in any sophistry you like but guys cannot marry guys, whatever license the government issues, any more than pigs can fly. Putting a pig on an airplane or legalizing same-sex unions cannot change the natures of the beasts.\n\nThe ladies and gentlemen of the press are beside themselves with glee, but I seriously doubt that Obama's campaign is going to get much of a bounce out of his theatrical gesture.\n\nGays and gay rights advocates (as distinguished from people who just happen to be homosexual without making sexual identity their entire raison d'etre) are already committed to the Democratic Party.\n\nAt this point, the President should not be, once again, pandering to his base but reaching out to independents and moderates, blue collar workers in the Midwest and working and middle class whites in the South.\n\n'Guys cannot marry guys, whatever license the government issues, any more than pigs can fly'\n\nIn North Carolina, people voted to ban not just same-sex marriage but civil unions as well. Obama might just as well write off the state--and the rest of the South.\n\nObama's tawdry little morality play--the agonized man of conscience finally deciding to do the right thing--means next to nothing, but the way he did it reveals a great deal about the President and his admirers.\n\nFirst there was the coy shilly-shallying--will he or won't he--as transparent as a perennially as the display of chastity put on by an experienced woman being picked up in a bar for the thousandth time.\n\nEven worse is Obama's disturbing habit of dragging his daughters into the conversation.\n\nThis time, he told ABC news that Malia and Sasha, who have friends whose parents are same-sex couples, would not understand discrimination: 'Malia and Sasha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated different,' Obama said. 'It doesn't make sense to them and frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.'\n\nSo the President of the United States, on a serious moral and political question, is worried not about law, marriage, or Christian moral theology but only about what his daughters might think.\n\nFor good measure he threw in the opinion that a ban on same-sex marriage violates the Golden Rule as understood by his wife Michelle. So, if I wish to marry a woman, then a woman should be permitted to do the same?\n\nWhat about if John wants to marry Jane, then Jim and Sally can also marry her? The obvious flaw in the logic is that we have to assume that all humans are exactly the same and should have the same opportunities.\n\nApplied generally, such a principle can only be implemented in a totalitarian communist state--not that such a conclusion would disturb our President.\n\nIf I did not already know the First Couple were anti-Christian bigots, this absurd and obscene application of the basic Christian moral principle would be proof enough. Obviously, Jesus and Paul just weren't as smart as Michelle Obama.\n\nBarack Obama, in staging his little crisis of conscience for TV, apparently believes that the American people are as stupid and dishonest as he is. Judging from the media's gushing repsonses, he may be right, but these amateur theatrics give some of us even more reason for doing our best to turn him out of office in November.", "The Queen might have to play silly paratroopers with James Bond, but please leave Winston Churchill out of it\n\nBy Rev George Pitcher for the Daily Mail\n\nPublished: 06:39 EDT, 30 July 2012 | Updated: 13:32 EDT, 30 July 2012\n\nBefore I reach my major, Giant Koi-sized carp, let me say that it was actually quite good. I enjoyed the Teletubby grassy knoll and the way that producer Danny Boyle had pandered to Cameronism by having 'decent, hard-working families' from Victoriana serving the interests of an industrial-revolutionary Bob Diamond, played with perfect self-regard by Sir Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThose weren't the only funny bits. The director's self-promotion by starting with a rendition of Danny Boy was priceless, as was the Fijis entering the arena to the sound of the Bee Gees. All in all, it was exactly what one previewer had described as 'delightfully bonkers' and utterly unlike the dreadfully smug massed ranks of automotons that you get from totalitarian regimes in places like Beijing.\n\n'Actually quite good': The Olympic Opening Ceremony has been hailed as a success\n\nBut now to my heartburningly dyspeptic gripe. Her Majesty upstaging Dame Judi Dench as M in a pastiche of a James Bond curtain-raiser was bad enough. We've always been led to believe that the Queen stood apart from the vanity of the lesser royals, with their Royal It's a Knock-Out and Hello! magazine wedding spreads.\n\nCan anyone now doubt, with the Queen herself being collected from the Palace, in character, by a B-movie thriller actor and apparently parachuting into the Olympic stadium, like Dame Edna Everage on speed and flashing her knickers, that the entire institution of monarchy has been reduced to a subsidiary of the reality-TV entertainment industry?\n\nCurtain-raiser: Stuntmen dressed as the Queen and James Bond parachute into the Olympic Park\n\nNo wonder she looked furious in the stadium. Had she only just realised that the show might have been subtitled 'I'm a Monarch - Get Me Out Of Here!'?\n\nHas any former English king or queen so humiliated themself? Did Queen Victoria do a Christmas turn as Bob Cratchit's wife? Did Queen Elizabeth I write a love sonnet entitled 'The Only Way Is Essex'?\n\nHumiliating: The Queen had taken part in a short film with James Bond actor Daniel Craig\n\nBut even that's not really my complaint. The tide of vacuous celebrity stunts has long been rising on the Royal Family - and it was only a matter of time before it lapped at the pearled neck of the Queen herself.\n\nWhat I really object to was that the late and pretty universally acknowledged as great Sir Winston Churchill was coralled into the whole tacky schtick, whereby London mayor Boris Johnson has co-opted the institutions of the British state in support of the Olympic commercial cornucopia.\n\nGreat man: Was it right to co-opt Winston Churchill into the Olympic Opening Ceremony?\n\nAs 'The Queen' and craggy Bond actor Daniel Craig helicoptered around London, buzzing tower bridge and waving at the faithful dupes who will applaud anything 'famous', Boyle's movie-makers had Churchill's statue in Parliament Square gurn up at them and wave his walking stick in salutation.\n\nIt was like his namesake bulldog in the Churchill Insurance ads. I have no problem with the wonders of animated statues, whether they're weeping bloody tears in some catholic tourist trap or getting in the way in Covent Garden.\n\nBut I do object to the memorial of a great man, who led the free world against a very real threat of evil, being reduced to the adulation of the imaginary hero who faces Smersh.\n\nChurchill was fortunate enough to die in 1965, just as the post-modern idea that invented image is more attractive than heroic reality was just getting its grip on the nation. I would like to think that we would give him a free pass when it comes to playing traducing games with the head of state and the Commonwealth, which he led in keeping us free from the shackles of oppression from a foreign power, only now to have to pay obeisance to all-conquering media and showbiz.\n\nHer sons - particularly the starstruck Edward - may have persuaded the Queen that it would be a frightfully jolly wheeze to play paratrooper with James Bond for the cameras. It may even have raised the Royals a few notches in the popularity polls that must mean so much to them.\n\nBut they might have left the memory of one who didn't have to live through all this out of it and who cannot now resist. He was real quality, from a time when we know what that was, and it would be good to honour that memory by leaving it intact."]}}
