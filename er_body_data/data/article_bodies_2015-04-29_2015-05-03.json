{"Samsung": {"2015-04-29": ["Later this year, Microsoft Corp could allow apps from competitor Google's Android operating system onto its own Windows phones. On Wednesday, this information was given by two sources familiar with the matter. This move by Microsoft indicates a major shift for the company. The world's biggest software company has been putting efforts to attract users but has managed to grab only 3% of the global smartphone market.\n\nAccording to Strategy Analytics, Samsung's Android phones cover 81% of the market and Apple Inc has 15% of the market. It has been anticipated that Microsoft will announce regarding the move at its developer conference in San Francisco later on Wednesday.\n\nThis summer, the company also has plans to release its new Windows 10 operating system. The operating system is planned to run across PCs, tablets and phones. The PC market is still dominated by the company. However, it hasn't succeeded when it comes to tablets and phones, to a certain extent as a result of a lack of apps.\n\nThis move of allowing Android apps onto its phones and tablets could come out as an important step taken to achieve that. However, it could also lead to the risk of making Windows phones less preferred if they are just seen as emulations of Android devices.\n\nAccording to Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC, \"Their approach recognizes that code for a mobile app can start from any of a number of sources. The only approach to succeed today is to recognize the multiple developer ecosystems out there\". In late morning trading on Nasdaq, Microsoft shares fell 0.5% at $48.9.", "Things are starting to get more exciting in the Android smartphone world these days. LG have just launched the new G4 and while it won't be featured in this list until it hits shelves, it'll certainly make an impact later this year. As for May however, well there are still some excellent options out there no matter what sort of Android smartphone you're looking for, and the flagships of 2015 are here, ready and waiting for you to pick them up at your local carrier store or from Amazon. This list is of the device available in North America right now, and next month's list should be very interesting, indeed.\n\nWhat was once some sort of big movement in the smartphone industry, the OnePlus One is just another Android smartphone. In that it's now easier than ever to get a hold of, and as things with Cyanogen didn't go down too well, it won't have the Cyanogen branding too much longer. The device is a 5.5-inch 1080p affair powered by a Snapdragon 801 and while the hardware is still pretty solid, it's becoming harder to stay a loyal fan of the OnePlus One what with recent delays in their new Oxygen OS, but for enthusiasts and those looking for a different route, the OnePlus One won't disappoint.\n\nWhile the Xperia Z3 is an excellent device, it's fairly tough to get hold of in the US - unless you're a T-Mobile customer - and compared to other devices from the second half of 2014, the Xperia Z3 didn't go quite as far as it could have. It stuck with the Snapdragon 801, 3GB of RAM and 5.2-inch display that the Xperia Z2 launched with this time last year, and it didn't change much at all from the overall experience. Still, if you want a Sony device, the Xperia Z3 has nice, fairly untouched software (complete with a recent upgrade to Lollipop) and it's a well-built smartphone. The Xperia Z3 has recently just been \"relaunched\" on T-Mobile at a lower price point, and now makes for attractive smartphone purchase.\n\nThe Moto X (2014) is an excellent smartphone, and if you're just looking for something that looks nice and has down to Earth software on it, then look no further. After the recent launch of the G4, Motorola was keen to remind everyone that they've been doing leather for a lot longer, and they don't just offer leather, they also offer bamboo and other wood options, too. However, if you want a better camera experience, some more exciting software features and a better display, then there are other options out there. With Moto Maker though, you can choose from wood, leather and a myriad of color options, so if you want a great smartphone to live with that doesn't try too hard to be anything more than it is, the Moto X (2014) will be just what you're looking for.\n\nLG's G Flex 2 was one of the first devices to be announced in 2015, and also one of the first with a Snapdragon 810. In a fetching new red color, the 5.5-inch curvy smartphone looks great, however it's not quite the smartphone we were hoping it to be. Following in the footsteps of the original G Flex, which offered a phone that you could genuinely flex and had a curved display from top-to-bottom, the Plastic OLED flexible panel just doesn't do enough to feel worth it right now. The Snapdragon 810 inside the G Flex 2 doesn't perform as we'd like and it's sadly not what we were expecting from LG this time around. Our review can be found here.\n\nThe DROID Turbo is a classic case of that carrier exclusive smartphone you wish was available elsewhere. Not only does the DROID Turbo look great, but the 5.2-inch Quad HD display, Snapdragon 805 and a massive 3,900 mAh make this a smartphone to admire. It's exclusive to Verizon's network, which may or may not be the deal breaker for you here, but if their network has never let you down and you're happy paying a little extra, then this could be the best device available on Verizon. For a lot of people, the DROID Turbo has all the specs the Moto X should have launched with, and for those on Verizon, you can tap into those specs.\n\nLG just recently announced the G4, and while it bests the G3 in pretty much every major way, the G3 was already a tough phone to beat. It might feature a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, but the device is physically quite small thanks to some wizardry on LG's part. The curved back and rear-mounted buttons help make the G3 feel good in the hand and while the Snapdragon 801 is arguably not as well suited to a Quad HD display as the Snapdragon 805, there's more than enough grunt in the G3 for the majority of users. Even in the face of 1080p displays though, the LG G3's Quad HD display was never all that nice to look at outside of all those pixels. Still, it's led LG to some of their best quarters in company history, so it's clearly done the job!\n\nThe HTC One M9 was recently released, and as we discovered in our review there isn't all that much to write home about. This is when we're talking about the HTC One M8 of course, but the M9 is a Snapdragon 810 powered device with 3GB of RAM and a 5.0-inch 1080p display and it's just as good-looking as last year's model. The camera is the biggest change this year with a 20.7-megapixel sensor instead of an UltraPixel sensor. The camera is a high point here, as is the excellent build quality, but if you were hoping for something a little newer, then there are other options to consider.\n\nAs massive smartphones go, the Nexus 6 is one of the better built and more fully featured out there, it's a great device that shows off what stock Android is capable of, but it is a little pricey. With a Snapdragon 805, 3GB of RAM and a Quad HD display, this holds up as one of the most powerful devices available, even in the face of the Snapdragon 810. With stock Android onboard you're assured speedy updates and it's a good phone for those looking to tinker and mess around with Android as well. The Nexus 6 is also the only smartphone that can enjoy Google's vision for what a wireless network could be, Project Fi, so it recently gained one more string to its bow. It might be pricey, but if you're interested in a powerful, well built Android smartphone the Nexus 6 is a great way to go.\n\nOne of the few devices available that takes a stylus and turns it into an exceptionally useful tool, the Galaxy Note 4 is one hell of a smartphone, especially if you want something with a larger display. The 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display is bright, colorful and the Snapdragon 805 under the hood works great, too. A device for those needing to get something done, the Galaxy Note 4 is an excellent follow-up to the Galaxy Note 3.\n\nSamsung have outdone themselves this year with the launch of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. Yes, there's no longer a removable battery or microSD card slot, but what you gain is a metal build that feels excellent in the hand. Plus, this is the one device that will buck the trend this year of using a Snapdragon processor and instead uses Samsung's Exynos 7420 with great results. It looks good, the color options are great and the camera is vastly improved upon. The Galaxy S6 Edge is essentially the same phone with sloped edges either side. As of right now, these don't do too much but over time, developers will harness this new hardware for all sorts of new features. The Galaxy S6 duo are the best smartphones that Samsung have ever made and the fact that they eschew the Snapdragon 810 which is rare misstep for Qualcomm makes the Galaxy S6 one of the devices to buy in 2015. Our review of this duo can be found here.", "WASHINGTON | Samsung regained the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as sales in emerging markets helped it overtake Apple, a research group says.\n\nIDC said Samsung sold 82.4 million smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5 per cent market share.\n\nEven though the number sold was down 7 per cent from a year ago, Samsung outpaced Apple, whose iPhone sales slipped slightly from the final quarter of 2014.\n\nApple held an 18.2 per cent market share in early 2015 after selling 61.2 million iPhones.\n\nThe figures were impacted by seasonal and other factors. Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple and Samsung were virtually tied with around 20 per cent of the market each, according to several surveys.\n\n\"The challenge made by Apple for the top spot in the fourth quarter returned to a clear lead for Samsung in the first quarter, despite the soaring global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,\" said IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella.\n\n\"Samsung's shipments, given that the S6 was not launched into the market for the full quarter, were driven by large volumes into emerging markets and steady demand for its mid-range and lower-priced smartphones.\"\n\nChinese manufacturer Lenovo was third after completing its acquisition of Motorola from Google. Its 5.6 per cent market share placed it ahead of fellow Chinese group Huawei, with 5.0 per cent, and South Korea's LG at 4.6 per cent.\n\nIDC said the overall global smartphone market grew 16.7 per cent from a year earlier, with total shipments of 337 million units.", "Samsung is once again the top smartphone maker in the world, according to volume sales of devices, according to a new report. Samsung has reclaimed the top spot from Apple, which briefly gained the lead during its iPhone 6 launch.\n\nSamsung is on a roll right now. The company is basking in the success of its latest smartphone duo, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, which are an undisputed success. The company expects to sell more than 70 million of the handsets, and has even had to commission an entire new factory in order to meet demand for the S6 Edge, which is currently exceeding supply and finding frustrated consumers unable to get their hands on the unique dual sided curved display handset.\n\nApple has been similarly successful in creating demand for its latest phone flagship iPhones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The launch of the two handsets last September was an unprecedented success for the company, and the two phones just exceeded sales expectations for the quarter and sent stock in the company shooting up to record highs.\n\nSamsung, however, has toppled Apple from the top spot in terms of volume of smartphone sales for the first quarter 2015 period, regaining its former lead, which it lost to Apple during the IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch period. Samsung's shipments of smartphones worldwide totaled 83.2 million, giving it a 24 percent market share as opposed to Apple's 18 percent market share. What makes the showing more impressive is that the results don't account for most of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge sales, except perhaps for some preorders, which took place in the first quarter.\n\nResearch firm Strategy Analytics reported the results. \"Samsung continued to face challenges in Asia and elsewhere, but its global performance has stabilized sufficiently well this quarter to overtake Apple and recapture first position as the world's largest smartphone vendor by volume,\" stated Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston.", "Chinese brand Xiaomi Inc topped the league table in the world's biggest smartphone market with 12.8 percent of the 110 million units shipped, followed closely by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at 12.3 percent and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, another Chinese player, at 10.2 percent, the data showed.\n\nStrategy Analytics declined to say how many handsets Samsung had shipped in China during the quarter, although it expected the South Korean company to return to the top three in the next one or two quarters following the launch of its flagship S6 and S6 edge models in April.\n\nIt expects Apple to surpass Xiaomi to top the China market later this year on the strength of its popular new iPhone 6 and 6 plus models. Apple on Monday reported a 71 percent increase in sales in China to $16.8 billion.\n\nIt was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 that Samsung did not rank in the top three for China smartphone shipments, according to the research firm.\n\nStrategy Analytics on Wednesday said Samsung overtook Apple to recapture the title of world's top smartphone maker by volume in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nSamsung shipped 83.2 million smartphones worldwide and captured 24 percent market share in the quarter, down from 31 percent a year earlier but better than Apple's 18 percent, it said.\n\n(Reporting by Se Young Lee; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Stephen Coates)", "HTC has not been doing pretty well in the mobile industry in recent years, bowing down to other Android phone makers such as Samsung, LG and even Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nHowever, it seems the Taiwanese manufacturer's shift to the midrange market has worked wonders in terms of its performance in sales.\n\nAccording to a report by Phone Arena, during the first quarter of this year, HTC reported a huge increase in its profit, posting revenue of 1.36 billion USD. That figure is a 25 percent increase year over year.\n\nIn the report, HTC also posted net profit of $11.8 million USD or 1.4 cents a share.\n\nThe increase in sales for the Taiwan-based manufacturer is attributed to last year's extensive Desire lineup.\n\nFor the current quarter that ends in June, the manufacturer reportedly expects 1.5 billion USD in revenue. The launch of the One M9, as well as the upcoming One M9+ would trigger another wave of profit for the Android phone maker.\n\nIn a statement by Cher Wang, HTC Chairwoman and CEO, the company executive commended the manufacturer's focus in improving design in technology \"for the mobile lifestyle.\"\n\nJust as HTC pioneered the smartphone market, it is vital that we drive the connected lifestyle through our pursuit of brilliance and by engaging strategic partners to bring the best and most innovative products to market\", said Wang in an official statement.", "WASHINGTON -- Makayla Stewart still can't believe that her sixth-grade class from Picayune, Miss., built a robot to help her hometown clean its public drains.\n\nAnd that they won a national scholastic technology award for their efforts, the only elementary school to do so.\n\n\"We've worked on it for a really long time,\" said Makayla, who, with her teacher, attended the awards ceremony Wednesday in the nation's capital to represent her class.\n\nThey worked on the project \"Tuesday through Thursday almost every week,\" the 11-year-old said during the event.\n\nThe sixth-graders from Nicholson Elementary School in Picayune, a town of nearly 11,000 in Pearl County near the southern tip of Mississippi, beat competitors from 3,100 schools to became one of the five national winners of the 2015 Samsung Resolve For Tomorrow Contest.\n\nThe prize was nearly $140,000 in cash and technology equipment for their school.\n\n\"I don't know if you know where Picayune, Mississippi, is,\" Sen.

Tesla's next big thing is widely believed to be a stationary battery, which will power homes, offices, and industrial spaces with stored energy.\n\nReports from The Wall Street Journal suggest that Tesla will devote as much as 25 percent of the capacity of its new $5 billion gigafactory, currently being built in Reno, Nevada, to the production of large battery packs for homes and businesses.\n\nOne of the most difficult things about energy distribution is that demand fluctuates dramatically during the day as households use more electricity in the morning and evening and hardly use any during the day while most people are at work. That problem can be multiplied with renewable energy sources, which suffer from supply fluctuations as well -- energy is in abundant supply when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, but production drops off as the weather changes. Cost-effective heavy-duty batteries could help store excess energy and smooth out the issues caused by resource inefficiency.\n\nStill, just because Tesla has had success building car batteries doesn't guarantee it will have success in the stationary battery industry. Venkat Viswanathan, an assistant professor for mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, told Ars over the phone today that cost effectiveness has to be at the forefront for a company trying to sell energy storage units.\n\n\"A car battery needs to be compact, it has to be light, so it can be more expensive than a battery for a stationary market, [where] space is not a constraint and weight is not a constraint,\" Viswanathan said. Especially for businesses looking for economies of scale, alternatives like compressed air energy storage will compete with stationary batteries in cost.\n\nFor individual homes, however, it might make more sense to invest in a battery, but again, cost will be a major issue when space isn't a factor. Tesla's lithium-ion batteries, which will be produced in partnership with Panasonic at its gigafactory, will have to compete intensely with products using cheaper electrodes and electrolytes. (Lead-acid batteries are one example, but several companies and research centers are also experimenting with materials that have advantages over the tried-and-true).\n\nTesla has already built stationary batteries for homes in partnership with SolarCity, a solar panel company that has Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a chairman. SolarCity says it has installed 300 Tesla-branded energy storage units in homes so far. Traditionally, people with solar panels on their roofs sell the excess electricity made during the day back to power companies and then buy power from power companies at night. With a battery pack, a house equipped with solar panels can be more self-sufficient.\n\n\"Tesla's long history of research and development has enabled a cost-effective, wall-mounted storage appliance that is small, powerful and covered by a long lasting full 10 year warranty,\" SolarCity's website says of the Tesla battery unit being used in the pilot program. \"The actual battery unit is about the size of a solar power inverter, and will be mounted on the wall in your garage or near your electrical panel.\"\n\nViswanathan told Ars that buying a battery for energy storage won't make sense in all markets, but in some places, like Hawaii or Scandinavia, where solar and wind energy penetration is high, it could make economic sense for a household to buy a stationary battery. \"There's lots of people who are far removed from the grid, and the stability of the grid is not guaranteed,\" Viswanathan told Ars. \"I would imagine even places like Japan and South Korea might benefit from something like this. In those places such a product makes perfect sense, especially if you've already gone halfway there by installing solar panels.\"\n\nThe WSJ says that SolarCity told California regulators last year that it cost $23,429 to install a stationary battery in a home. The solar power company is letting its pilot participants pay the battery off in monthly installations over 10 years. In leveraging the economies of scale that come with operating its gigafactory, Tesla may be able to reduce the cost of stationary batteries.\n\nStill, stationary batteries haven't become widespread yet, in part because there's been little demand for them from households, and in part because developing deploying units to store energy is expensive. Thus far, governments have largely stepped in to spur further research. In March, the Los Angeles Times reported that the California Public Utilities Commission will require three of the state's largest electricity providers to install 1,300 megawatts of storage capacity by 2024. It also noted that PG&E has received several million dollars in grants from the state to conduct experiments to further energy storage.\n\nThe stationary battery market is also not a sector that Tesla will go into unchallenged -- LG Chem, Samsung SMI, and AES Corp all make stationary batteries too, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDespite what we know about what Tesla may announce tomorrow at 8pm PST, there are still many unknowns. What will this next run of batteries cost? How much energy will they be able to store? Will Tesla announce any partnerships that will help sell stationary batteries to homeowners satisfied with their service on the traditional power grid?\n\nViswanathan told Ars he'll be watching to see what Musk announces regarding the battery's warranty -- \"If I'm a homeowner... I would expect a much bigger warranty\" than Tesla gives on its vehicle batteries, he said. Also, he said, he'll be curious about the battery's projected cost: \"the costs are going to come down substantially year after year,\" Viswanathan told Ars. \"The number I would be interested in is what the target number is three years down.\"\n\nArs will look for answers to all these questions and more tomorrow night at Tesla's event, so stay tuned!", "During its Wednesday earnings call, Apple rival Samsung Electronics reported net profit of 4.63 trillion won ($4.35 billion) for the January to March quarter, a 39% drop from its net profit of 7.49 trillion won in the year ago quarter. A sizable portion of the lost profit came from Samsung's mobile division, which brought in 2.74 trillion won ($2.5 billion) in the first quarter of 2015, vs. 6.43 trillion won in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nDespite the year over year profit loss, Samsung's earnings release highlighted its quarter over quarter improvement and pointed towards increased sales of middle-end smartphones including the Galaxy A series. Samsung doesn't divulge its smartphone sales, but analysts believe the company sold 83.2 million smartphones during the quarter, compared to Apple's 61.2 million.\n\nThe high number of sales let Samsung regain its title of the worlds largest smartphone maker, but many of those sales were for lower-priced phones and not flagship devices, causing it to lose profit year over year. Much of Samsung's profit loss can be attributed to the introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, letting Apple devices compete with Samsung devices on screen size for the first time.\n\nAhead of the launch of the two larger-screened iPhones, big screens were a feature that set Samsung devices apart from iPhones and drew customers for the South Korean company, but with the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus, Samsung has lost some of its grasp on customers seeking devices with bigger displays.\n\nSamsung expects its profits to increase during the second quarter following the global launch of the company's new Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge and on the strength of its semiconductor business. According to Samsung, demand for its curved S6 Edge has been high, but limited supplies have restricted sales.", "SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung, control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.

Much of the anticipation centered around the phone's powerful camera features, which were finally outed in full detail.\n\nThe phone's rear camera packs a 16-megapixel 1/2.6-inch sensor and an f/1.8 aperture lens. By comparison, the highly regarded iPhone 6 camera features a smaller 1/3-inch sensor.\n\nThere's also a great deal of speed in the G4's camera. It can capture a photo in just 0.276 seconds. Loading up the camera app takes just 0.6 seconds.\n\nFor autofocusing, the G4 uses a laser focus system that can be controlled with 9 different AF points when you're not in \"Basic\" shooting mode:\n\nOne feature that sets the G4 apart from many of its competitors is its full-fledged Manual shooting mode, which puts all the controls that photographers expect from high-end cameras into the smartphone's camera interface:\n\nOptions include: white balance, ISO, shutter speed, manual focus, exposure compensation, RAW, histogram, and light meter. Don't want to have to think about a particular option?

It's gorgeous to look at, has a stainless steel design, and includes a European convection oven. While it's not what you'd call inexpensive, at $3200 it's actually cheaper than other slide-in induction ovens like Samsung's Chef Collection Induction Range which runs for a cool suggested retail price of $3,699\n\nAfter boiling it all down, however, it turns out that spending a little extra cash pays dividends in the long run. In terms of both ease of use and sheer cooking performance, the Samsung Chef Collection runs rings around GE's compact 30-inch induction cooker making it the much wiser home appliance choice.\n\nThe GE PHS920SFSS induction range certainly has bold, beautiful looks to match its luxury price tag. Despite being compact and measuring a mere 30-inches wide, GE's liberal use of stainless steel materials in this oven's construction lend it a decidedly premium appearance. Further elevating the slide-in model's visual appeal is a front-mounted control panel. It's stylishly angled downwards plus sports clean lines and a gives the whole appliance a sleek shape. This design choice not only gives the range a futuristic profile, the panel's gentle slope places its buttons and keys within easy fingertip reach.\n\nUnlike the Samsung Chef Collection Induction Range, however, the GE PHS920SFSS lacks physical knobs to control its cooktop burners. That's a shame because one big challenge with induction cooking is the technology's low sensory feedback. For example gas stoves and electric cookers emit flame, heat, light, or some combination of all three. Induction ranges operate in relative stealth, heating compatible cookware using invisible magnetic fields only.\n\nThe Samsung Chef Collection Induction Range does its best to offset this issue by using LED lights placed around each of its burners to mimic the feel of real gas flames. Samsung also installed power level indicators next to each of the range's burners just in case you miss similar labels grafted onto its burner dials. This setup offers three methods which work together to effectively convey cooktop status.\n\nIn contrast to these practical design features, the GE PHS920SFSS range controls feel rather spartan and awkward to operate. The flat control panel houses tiny membrane-style buttons to command the ranges' four induction coils, two large (8 inch diameter), one small (6 inch diameter), and one extra large (11 inch diameter). The cooktop also contains a low-powered electric warming zone (non-induction) that's built for pots six inches in diameter.\n\nUnfortunately I often found it difficult to tell which set of buttons controlled what burner. That's because all the GE PHS920SFSS range's cooktop indicators sit up front on the control panel, not near the burners themselves. The panel's small keys are tricky to locate and tap without looking at them directly. GE certainly has the chops to build a stovetop with an elegant UI. I found the company's Glide Touch interface on its new Monogram Induction cooktop much easier and enjoyable to interact with.\n\nOne positive is that GE thoughtfully equips the small burner (back right) with a \"melt\" button. Pressing this will engage a preset heat level just hot enough to melt delicate ingredients such as butter and chocolate without scorching them. Likewise both of the large 8 inch burners feature similar \"simmer\" keys design for bringing sauces to a gentle bubble without the fear of burning\n\nAside from its futuristic induction cooking surface, the GE PHS920SFSS range offers an oven that's pretty pedestrian. Its 5.3 inch cubic foot capacity cavity is actually a tad small when stacked up against larger 5.8 inch ovens such as the Samsung NX58F5700, Whirlpool WEG730H0DS, and KitchenAid KGRS306BSS. That said the GE does boast a fan and linked heating element which promises true European convection baking and roasting.", "SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday (Apr 29).\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only three per cent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung , control 81 per cent of the market and Apple 15 per cent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.", "As the youngest of four sons, Cho Jung-Ho figured he wouldn't be inheriting the best parts of the conglomerate his father had built over the decades. Sure enough, after the storied patriarch died, in 2002, eldest brother Cho Yang-Ho got Korean Air Korean Air Lines, jewel of the Hanjin Group, at the time South Korea's eighth-largest chaebol. Brother No. 2, Cho Nam-Ho, was awarded Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction, the country's fourth-largest shipbuilder. Brother three, Cho Soo-Ho, who died nine years ago, took control of Hanjin Shipping Hanjin Shipping, whose cargo containers are stacked on ships and freight trains around the globe. \"I got the leftovers,\" says Jung-Ho, who had to content himself with an insurer and a securities firm.\n\n(Click here for the full list of Korea's Richest)\n\nThat division of assets set off a legal battle that climaxed in 2005, when Jung-Ho and Nam-Ho both broke away from the Hanjin Group and set off on their own. Today Jung-Ho can boast that he's far outstripped his brothers in wealth and success. With the insurer and the securities firm as the foundation, he's built a financial powerhouse-the Meritz Financial Group Meritz Financial Group. Its value has multiplied 17 times over since Cho left the Hanjin fold. Meritz Insurance, now as then, ranks among the country's top five fire-and-marine insurers-and is by far the largest of the group's seven companies in terms of assets. But Meritz Securities, once an also-ran, is the real moneymaker, and its stock price has soared 53% this year. Shares in Meritz Financial are up 45% in the same period.\n\nThat performance makes Cho, 56, a billionaire for the first time on our annual list of South Korea's richest. With a nearly 70% stake in Meritz Financial, his fortune now totals $1.3 billion. That's up from $640 million a year ago, when he debuted on the list. Cho Yang-Ho of KAL hasn't made the list since 2010 and is worth a bit more than $400 million; Cho Nam-Ho of Hanjin Heavy comes in at roughly $150 million. Hanjin founder Cho Choong-Hoon, 82 when he died, would no doubt be proud of his youngest son's success if disappointed by the partition of his empire and the bad blood among his battling heirs.\n\nIn his 29th-floor office in Meritz Tower, overlooking southern Seoul's swanky Gangnam district of offices, condominiums and fashionable shops lining broad avenues, Cho Jung-Ho offers an explanation for how he rose so high. \"I kept my focus,\" he says simply. \"The others didn't know how to focus.\" Incessant hard work, he adds, while eschewing the fast life of many of South Korea's second- and third-generation tycoons, also helped. \"I persevere. I work day in and day out.\"\n\nAnother key is Cho's focus on finding the right employees: \"I always interview a lot of people. I've been hiring a lot of people and laying a lot of people off. I'm looking for integrity, experience, dedication.\" He walks across his office and picks a book off a shelf. His choice is Dream Big, the story of how three Brazilian stockbrokers ended up buying three old-line American brands-Anheuser-Busch, Burger King and, with backing from Warren Buffett, Heinz. For Cho the book's central message was find the best people and reward them handsomely: \"This book has the same philosophy as mine.\"\n\nThe name Meritz comes from \"merit,\" he says. He thought of adding the plural \"s,\" signifying \"a lot of merit\" but figured that adding the letter \"z\" made a better impression as a distinctive brand. The name resonates in a country where factors other than accomplishments often decide favors and promotions. For Cho, performance-not personality, old school ties or blood relations-is the ultimate test.\n\nIn running a meritocracy, Cho gives his executives sweeping responsibilities, as long as they outpace the stiff competition. Two of Cho's top lieutenants, hired away from Samsung Securities-Alex Choi, chief executive of Meritz Securities, and Kim Yong-Beom, who heads Meritz Financial and Meritz Insurance-exemplify this philosophy. In fact, he says, all employees get the freedom to excel on their own. \"I give them the right environment to work in. I listen to them. They tell me what's going on. I don't have to motivate people. Everybody has their own goal.\" A major part of his job is to make sure the good ones earn considerably more than their peers at other institutions. \"Those outstanding workers get compensated-bonuses, promotions.\"\n\nMeritz has more than lived up to the promise of its name, but Cho is far from satisfied. He seems restless as an interview begins, saying, \"Normally I don't like giving interviews. I feel we've made some progress, but it's a bit premature. We feel we just got started.\"\n\nIt's as though he still feels the urge to catch up to his older brothers and beat them for the prize. Their father had divvied up everything in elaborate detail in his will, but the three youngest brothers believed that the eldest had wangled more than his share. None wants to discuss it publicly. Choi puts it this way: \"Detailed coverage of the troubled relationship among the brothers would really be unproductive as the disputes are buried privately within the family for the most part.\" He adds that \"the disputes are based on an unfair execution of the will in dividing the portfolio of the Hanjin Group, as perceived by the brothers.\"\n\nThe feelings remain so bitter that Cho is not on speaking terms with his eldest brother, 66-year-old Cho Yang-Ho of KAL. \"I used to fly Korean Air when my father was alive,\" says Jung-Ho, but he hasn't boarded a KAL plane for 12 years. \"I don't fly Korean Air.\" He and Yang-Ho don't say or write a word to each other, not even formally or ceremonially on holidays or at memorials for their father. In fact, Jung-Ho is startlingly blunt: \"I hate him.\"\n\nYang-Ho \"doesn't talk about the past or his brothers,\" says a KAL spokesman, measuring his words. \"It's not something really good that we want to talk about. [The brothers] are not really close. There was a dispute about ten years ago. It was about dividing the Hanjin Group. The younger brothers wanted to get more.\"\n\nJung-Ho's criticism is a remarkable revelation of the behind-the-scenes strife among heirs to chaebol fortunes. He's not finished, though. He says he has serious misgivings about the decision of his sister-in-law Choi Eun-Young, chairman of Hanjin Shipping since her husband Cho Soo-Ho died, to turn over control of the company to Korean Air. \"That was a mistake,\" he says, even though Hanjin Shipping was hemorrhaging cash after a global transportation slump and needed funds that KAL could provide. Nobody asked Jung-Ho's advice, but he definitely has an opinion. KAL, he says, \"has taken a financially unstable company and made it worse.\" But, in fact, the company's share price has risen 23% since the deal was completed last June. And though its revenue fell in the second half of the year, it virtually erased some $530 million in losses posted for the same period in 2013. A spokesman for Eun-Young says \"the best way to survive was to sell to KAL.\" Moreover, he adds, Yang-Ho and Soo-Ho got along fine. \"There was no animosity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jung-Ho and second brother Cho Nam-Ho, 64, remain in close touch. While shipbuilding pulls out of a prolonged worldwide drop in orders, Meritz has provided insurance and advised on bond issues. Now Jung-Ho believes that Hanjin Heavy's outlook is brightening as orders come back. For his part, Nam-Ho has no desire to hark back to old problems. \"So much time has passed,\" says a spokesman. \"We don't have any issues with Korean Air. We want to focus on business. We are maintaining a good business partnership [with Meritz].\" He insists that the company split from the Hanjin Group for business, not personal, reasons.\n\nCho Jung-Ho's business acumen goes back to his studies abroad. After attending boarding schools in Massachusetts and California, he studied economics at the University of Southern California. He worked for several years for Korean Air in Europe before going on to an M.B.A. at IMD in Lausanne.\n\nWith that background he acquired some elite tastes. Touring Europe over the summer with his father, mother (now 93) and brothers, he developed an appetite for fine wines and fancy cars. \"I can tell you 100 labels of wine,\" he says. Like many Korean tycoons and family members, he's a member of the Seoul golf club Trinity, but says, \"Golf is not my foremost leisure activity.\" Though a chauffeur drives him to work in a sober Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz, on weekends he prefers to tool around in his Ferrari, Porsche Porsche or Bentley beyond the capital's swarming traffic. For sound effects, he says, \"I listen to Puccini.\" He also enjoys the company of his two daughters-the elder a research assistant at Meritz Securities, the younger in school. A son lives in California.\n\nCho acknowledges that the transition back to South Korea was difficult. Coming home in 1989 as a director with Hanjin Investment & Securities, as Meritz was then named, he had to get used to talking in Korean rather than English or French. \"I am Korean,\" he says. \"This is a Korean company. Everyone speaks Korean,\" though his top executives-Choi, who has degrees from Amherst and Stanford, and Kim, who went to Seoul National University-are fluent in English.\n\nAt what would appear to be the top of his game, Cho refuses to take an optimistic view of the road ahead. \"I believe the future of life in Korea is not so high,\" he says. Can the \"Korean miracle\" endure? \"I say 'yes' with a lot of apprehension.\" Running scared is certainly part of what makes him tick, but in his case there's a sense of trying not just to stay ahead but to pull far beyond the pack. \"Until I retire, I will remain in this [industry],\" he says, gazing around his spacious office, all stark gray and white lines, without paintings or other souvenirs of success.\n\nThe dispute with his eldest brother may still rankle, but today he is at peace with how things turned out. He recalls his father's attempts to reconcile him to his fate: inheriting the financial assets in an empire that was largely dedicated to transportation, whether by air or by sea. \"When my father divided Hanjin in four different ways, he said to us, 'It might not look fair. Some of you get a bigger share of the prize.' But he added, 'Don't feel so bad; it's how you run the company.' \"\n\nA Case of \"Nut Rage\" Grounds KAL Heiress\n\nKorean Air Lines Chairman Cho Yang-Ho faces a family issue that's more embarrassing than his conflict with his youngest brother. A daughter, Cho Hyun-Ah, or Heather Cho, eldest of his three children, remains in prison, convicted of striking a crew member on a Korean Air plane in December and, as the plane was taxiing for takeoff, interfering with the flight by ordering the plane to return to the gate at New York's JFK Airport.\n\nCho, then KAL's senior vice president responsible for in-flight services, castigated a hostess in first class for serving her macadamia nuts in their bag when she should have put them on a plate. She struck the hostess and ordered the chief steward off the plane. The press was soon describing her as having gone into a \"nut rage.\"\n\nAppointed by her father eight years ago, Cho, 40, had to resign. Convicted and sentenced to one year in prison in February, she is appealing on the grounds that the plane was not endangered. Appearing in a light-green prison uniform, she told an appeals court last month that she would \"reflect on what I need to do to pay for my mistakes.\"\n\nHer reclusive father apologized before the media and again in court \"for the trouble caused by my daughter's foolish conduct.\" He blamed himself for having \"failed to raise my daughter properly.\" -D.K.", "By Emeka Aginam\n\nThe Managing Director of Samsung Electronics West Africa, Brovo Kim has disclosed that Samsung planned first Digital Village would provide access to innovative healthcare and educational needs for the community.\n\nThe project, according to Samsung is located in Oban community located in the Akamkpa local government area of Cross River State.\n\nHe said that the aim of the capacity building program is to increase health outcomes, strengthen educational delivery and increase the economic potential of Oban community.\n\nThe project, which is part of the company's strategic Corporate Citizenship program, would change the lives of the community.\n\nHighlighting the unique features of this solution, Kim said that the Samsung Digital Village is innovative in its design due to its use of alternative energy, which remains a major challenge in Nigeria and is often an obstacle in implementing such initiatives in rural communities.\n\n\"The Digital Village demonstrates our innovative approach to investing in people and their communities. This initiative offers a complete educational infrastructure, comprehensive healthcare solution and power generation capabilities that will spur the growth of small businesses and harness the energy of the sun to minimise running costs, among others,\" Kim said. The launch is scheduled for May 7, 2015.\n\nThe Digital Village, according to him, consists of five key integrated solutions that work together to benefit a community in the delivery of health care services, education and employment.\n\nThey include: a Solar Powered Internet School, Solar Powered Tele-Medical Centre, Solar Powered Dental and Blood Analysis Clinic, a Solar Power Generator, as well as an Administrative Centre.\n\nThe Solar Powered Internet School consists of a container fully equipped with complete education curriculum and smart school technology; it seats 24 students, providing them with access to education using interactive technology.\n\nThe Solar Powered Tele-Medical Centre is equipped with ear, eye and mother and child assessing facilities, while the Dental and Blood Analysis Clinic has a state-of-the-art blood analysis machine for on-the-spot diagnosis, as well as tools to treat dental complications.\n\nSpecifically designed for rural areas, the centre offers professional medical treatment, quick medical diagnosis and health education. It also helps minimise the need for rural dwellers to travel to urban areas for medical attention.\n\nA Solar Power Generator has also been deployed to supply power to the host community to boost small businesses in the area. The generator does not emit pollutants and has negligible maintenance costs, which will lower the environmental impact and reduce overall operating costs. Finally, the Administrative Centre will serve as the coordinating hub for all the Digital Village activities in the Oban community.\n\nSHARE ON TwitterFacebookGoogle+Buffer", "WORLD FINANCE UPDATE:\n\nThe Australian dollar has moved past the US80 cent mark in response to a weaker greenback, and after the Federal Reserve suggested a slow series of rate rises, but likely not as early as June.\n\nAt 0630 AEST on Thursday, the local currency was trading at 80.20 US cents, up from 79.99 cents on Wednesday.\n\nAnd the Australian share market looks set to open lower after Wall Street fell on news the US economy grew just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 0645 AEST on Thursday, the June share price index futures contract was down 41 points at 5,786.\n\nELSEWHERE:\n\nWASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve has left open its timeframe for a rise in interest rates, following a winter slowdown that stalled US economic growth.\n\nFRANKFURT - Inflation in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, crept higher in April with consumer prices rising by 0.4 per cent year-on-year.\n\nFRANKFURT - Euro area private sector loans, a gauge of economic health, have started growing again, suggesting the European Central Bank's monetary policy is beginning to work.\n\nOSLO - Norway's state-owned pension fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, has reported a record quarterly return, owing primarily to the European Central Bank's easing of monetary policy.\n\nNEW YORK - Generic drug company Mylan has raised its bid for a second time for Perrigo, offering $US35.6 billion ($A44.44 billion) for the over-the-counter giant.\n\nMOSCOW - Russia's gas giant Gazprom says its net profits in 2014 plunged sevenfold over the previous year, weighed down by fallout from the Ukraine crisis and shrinking value of the rouble.\n\nNEW YORK - MasterCard says its profit rose 17 per cent in the first quarter, as consumers across the globe spent more on their MasterCards.\n\nMILAN - Car maker Fiat Chrysler returned to profit in the first quarter thanks to a 38 per cent jump in revenue in North America and modest growth in Europe.\n\nWASHINGTON - Samsung regained the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as sales in emerging markets helped it overtake Apple, a research group says.", "Samsung just launched the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge, but that doesn't mean the company is ignoring future flagship devices - or at least two in particular.

Apple came in at second with 61.2 million units shipped, followed by Lenovo and Huawei.\n\nBut Samsung's smartphone shipments dropped 6.2% from the same quarter of last year, making it the only top-six vendor to see a dip in its numbers. Apple, by comparison, saw a whopping 40% jump in its total shipments, while both Lenovo and Huawei increased 14.1% and 27.7%, respectively.\n\nCounterpoint Research pointed out that shipments for Samsung's premium models, Galaxy S5 and Note 4, declined in the premium segment, which was dominated by Apple's iPhone last quarter. iPhones, meanwhile, accounted for 70% of Apple's total revenue, an all-time high.", "Facebook is rapidly expanding its latest inspiring program, Internet.org, an initiative bringing together technology leaders, nonprofits and local communities to connect the two-thirds of the world that does not have internet access. Internet.org, for instance, has recently become available in India, Ghana and Colombia.\n\nRelated: Tech Giants Form Another Group to Bring the Internet to the Global Masses\n\nClearly, this evolving ability to connect the world and move toward greater availability, globally, of resources and knowledge is truly amazing.\n\nThere is also plenty to emulate here: As an executive at a company whose goal is to help mid-sized and large enterprises utilize tools that help them grow, I am always looking for ways businesses can become more successful. Facebook's Internet.org offers some great lessons for organizations, and here are four I'd like to share:\n\nGive in order to get. Facebook is giving free internet to those in need. While this necessitates large financial contributions from Facebook and its partners, all have weighed the pros and cons and ultimately decided on the importance of this initiative. In return, they are building brand awareness with new audiences they were previously unable to reach. Growth depends on acquiring new customers, and businesses have a greater chance of gaining new customers by giving. Now, giving doesn't always equate to a free product or service, but might involve a discount or perk for potential customers who need it. While offering discounts to charitable causes may not at first generate as much revenue, it opens opportunities for future revenue growth. By giving to the greater good, businesses gain new customers and strengthen relationships with their existing clientele.\n\nFacebook is aiming to help solve global concerns, like poverty, lack of resources and inequality, by strengthening global connectivity. The company has identified an issue and developed a solid plan to resolve it. This is a lesson for mid-sized and large enterprises, which often get stuck in a mindset that focuses on the day-to-day routine and product. These companies fail to understand what the customer actually needs. Instead, they should take a step back and put themselves in the mindset of that customer; this way, they can see how their service or product fits the customer's needs. Better yet, they should ask customers what issues they see with the product and how they he business might solve their particular problem.\n\nRelated: With New Organization, Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg Wants Everyone on the Planet to Be Online\n\nFacebook is without a doubt one of the most successful companies ever. But it is not complacent. On the contrary, it's pushing the envelope to grow, using a concept that works -- connecting people with other people. Once a business knows what works for its customers and fulfills that need, the work still isn't finished. Questions need to be regularly asked by companies of all types. How else can a business serve its customers? How can it ensure it keeps its loyal customers coming back for more? And is there a way to further innovate the product or service to make life easier for customers? Understanding what works is the starting point for growing into an even more successful enterprise.\n\nTo establish Internet.org, Facebook partnered with Ericsson, MediaTek, Nokia, Opera, Qualcomm and Samsung. These companies will develop joint projects, share knowledge and mobilize industries and governments to bring the world online. Each partner wll serve a significant purpose. Similarly, mid-sized enterprises looking to accomplish an identified goal can partner with the right company to grow and capitalize on its idea. These companies shouldn't fear working with other businesses, but rather seize the opportunity to open themselves up to new audiences and bigger ideas.\n\nWhile not all businesses have the resources Facebook has to fight a global issue, they are business stewards nonetheless. And there are several key tactics and strategies to be learned from what Facebook has accomplished. Surely, we can all agree that we can learn a thing or two from Facebook.", "The Wall Street Journal recently published an article titled 'How Sony Makes Money Off Apple's iPhone' (paywalled). In it, authors Takashi Mochizuki and Eric Pfanner break down the image sensor market, showing how Sony is well above the rest in every regard.\n\nSourcing information from Techno Systems Research, WSJ shares Sony's impressive numbers. The numbers show the Japanese electronics company reeled in a whopping 40% of image sensor production in 2014, 5% more than the previous year. Behind Sony was OmniVision at 16%, Samsung at 15% and 'Others' which total in at roughly 29%.\n\nMuch of Sony's massive market share is due to their partnership in the world of smartphone makers, most notably Apple, who's consistently used Sony cameras in their iPhone and iPad lineups.\n\nThe report focuses specifically on smartphone cameras, but hidden in the numbers is the truth behind Sony's entire image sensor market, including mirrorless and DSLR sensors, which are used by a number of other manufacturers.\n\nAs promising as Sony's market share currently is, WSJ notes it might not always be that way. Specifically, the article notes:\n\nSome analysts say keeping up with demand might be Sony's biggest immediate challenge. In the long run, Sony could be vulnerable because of its dependence on Apple, which sometimes has shifted suppliers with little warning.\n\nSony isn't just looking to tread water though. Earlier this year, Sony announced it was looking to invest almost $1 billion into image sensor research and development to stay on top of the game.\n\nAs a whole, WSJ reports the image sensor market has grown into a massive $8.65 billion industry last year, an 80% increase since 2009.", "SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics expects the new Galaxy S6 devices to reverse declining earnings and spark profits from its smartphone and components businesses. Shares rose on the prediction.\n\nSamsung trumpeted the coming revival on Wednesday after reporting its fourth straight quarterly drop in net income. Consumers have been switching to Apple Inc.'s larger iPhones and cheaper Chinese devices as the rising South Korean won makes Samsung products more expensive abroad.\n\nMaking chips and screens for its own mobile devices while also supplying rivals may help Samsung blunt the impact of sales gains by Apple, which posted a surge in earnings. The Galaxy S6 phones, including the more expensive Edge with a wraparound display, were released this month to positive reviews and strong demand said to have prompted an acceleration of curved-screen output.\n\n\"The second quarter will be brighter as mobile earnings are expected to improve, largely driven by the increased sales of the S6,\" said Greg Roh, a Seoul-based analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. \"The pricier Edge device will take up half of the total S6 shipment from May, and that will give a strong lift to its mobile business.\"\n\nThe stock has advanced 4.4 per cent this year, compared with the 12 per cent increase in the benchmark Kospi index.\n\nNet income, excluding minority interests, fell 40 per cent to 4.52 trillion won ($4.2 billion) in the quarter ended March, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said.\n\nSamsung, the world's biggest chipmaker, said it should capitalize on stronger demand for the semiconductors used in mobile phones and servers.\n\n\"In the second quarter, the company expects its overall earnings to increase,\" Samsung said. \"In 2015, continued growth is expected due to the growth of emerging smartphone markets, such as China and India.\"\n\nOperating profit at the mobile-phone unit fell 57 per cent to 2.74 trillion won in the first quarter as Apple won high-end customers.\n\nSamsung shipped 83.2 million smartphones in the March quarter, helping it regain the title of world's biggest vendor after dropping into a tie with Apple in the December period, according to Strategy Analytics. Apple shipped 61.2 million iPhones in the most recent quarter, it said.\n\nSamsung has projected record sales for the high-end S6 smartphones released this month. Samsung will sell 46 million this year, said Kevin Lee, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co.\n\nThe phone is among the Samsung products featured in the new Avengers: Age of Ultron movie as part of a global partnership with Marvel Entertainment.\n\nDemand for the curved-screen Edge prompted the company to accelerate production, people familiar with the matter have said. The company can make 5 million units a month, they said.\n\n\"Edge supply is fast-improving, so the tight supply situation will be eased during the second quarter,\" said Park Jin Young, Samsung vice-president of mobile communications. \"If we look at it over the model's life cycle, S6 will be the best-seller.\"\n\nApple this week posted a 33 per cent jump in profit in the quarter ended in March, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 6 models.\n\nProfit at Samsung's semiconductor business, which makes both memory chips and application processors, was 2.93 trillion won, compared with 1.95 trillion won a year earlier.\n\nSamsung, which previously relied on semiconductors from Qualcomm Inc. for its mobile devices, switched to its own processor and modem chips for the S6 lineup.\n\nThe company also is said to have won orders for the main processors in the next iPhone.\n\nThe consumer-electronics division, which oversees TVs and home-appliances, posted a 140 billion-won loss in the quarter from a 190 billion-won profit a year earlier. Samsung expects the unit to have a stronger second quarter on seasonally higher demand for air conditioners and high-end TVs.\n\nIncreasing sales of high-margin screens helped Samsung's panel-making division return to operating profit of 520 billion won in the first quarter.\n\nSamsung Display Co. is expanding sales of its organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, panels from Galaxy devices to Chinese device makers, including Lenovo Group.\n\nSamsung Display, which is 85 per cent owned by Samsung Electronics, is said to have created a standalone team of about 200 employees to work exclusively on Apple products.\n\nCapital spending in 2015 will be similar to the year earlier, though \"there is a strong possibility that it may increase,\" Samsung said. The company spent 23.4 trillion won last year.", "The Samsung NX500 ($799.99 with 16-50mm lens) packs a lot of features into a relatively small frame, including Wi-Fi, a fast 9fps capture rate, and 4K video capability. It uses the same 28-megapixel APS-C image sensor as the high-end NX1, and ships with a compact zoom lens. It's a solid mirrorless camera, but its video codec makes footage a chore to edit on many computer systems. Our Editors' Choice in this category, the Sony Alpha 6000, shoots a little bit faster and includes a built-in EVF and flash.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe NX500 is sized in line with most other mirrorless cameras of its type. The body measures 2.5 by 4.7 by 1.7 inches (HWD) and weighs 10.1 ounces. All versions of the camera have a top plate that's silver in color, but you have a choice of getting it with a black, brown, or white leatherette covering. The handgrip is fairly substantial, adding some depth to the body; it extends just past the lens mount. The Olympus OM-D E-M10 doesn't have quite as deep of a grip, but is a bit larger (3.2 by 4.7 by 1.8 inches) due to an in-body EVF, flash, and image stabilization system.\n\nThe NX500 omits all of these -- stabilization is lens based, an external clip-on flash is included, and there's no EVF or way to add one. The included 16-50mm Power Zoom ED OIS lens is stabilized, but if you want a flash and EVF in a Samsung mirrorless body you'll need to move up to the next model in the NX series, the NX30.\n\nThe flash clips into the hot shoe, located in the typical spot, centered behind the lens, on the top plate. To the right you'll find a dedicated button to launch Wi-Fi functions, a control wheel, and a standard mode dial. The power switch, shutter release, and Autoexposure Lock (AEL) button sit on a slight angle at the top of the handgrip.\n\nRear controls sit to the right of the tilting display. A dedicated movie button sits at an angle, next to the thumb rest, with a rear control dial sitting just to the left of your thumb for easy access. Other rear buttons control exposure compensation, set the focus point, change the information displayed on the LCD, adjust the drive mode, change the autofocus mode, set the ISO mode, and control menu, playback, and delete functions.\n\nThere's also an Fn button. It brings up an on-screen display of shooting functions. Most of these (including the aperture, shutter speed, drive mode, EV compensation setting, ISO, and focus mode) are accessible via control buttons, but from this menu you'll be able to see the set values presented in one place and adjust them via touch or dial as desired. You can control the white balance, picture output mode, metering pattern, flash output, autofocus area, and toggle face detection via this display.\n\nSamsung opted for AMOLED technology for the NX500's rear display, which generally delivers an image with more contrast and a punchier look than a typical rear LCD. The 3-inch display is plenty sharp -- it squeezes 1,036k dots into its frame -- and I had no issues using it outdoors on a bright spring day. The display is sensitive to touch, so you can tap an area of the frame to set focus and exposure; the two parameters can be set independently if desired, which is a unique feature to Samsung cameras. And the display is mounted on a hinge, so you can tilt it to view from below, above, or flip it all the way forward for selfies.\n\nSamsung was a pioneer in putting Wi-Fi into cameras, and the NX500 continues to lead the pack in connectivity. It features dual-band Wi-Fi, so you can connect to 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks and devices, as well as Bluetooth. The latter only works with Android devices; it can be used to set the date and time, add GPS data to photos (based on your phone's GPS), and keep the connection alive between phone and camera for quicker transfers.\n\nIf you have an iOS device you'll have to manually connect to the NX500's Wi-Fi, which is a more typical scenario for connectivity. Once connected, you can use the free Samsung Camera Manager app to copy images and videos over to your smartphone, or to take remote control of the camera. Full manual control is available, and you can even adjust the lens zoom if a power zoom lens is attached to the camera.\n\nPerformance and Conclusions\n\nThe NX500 is a speedy performer. It starts and captures an in-focus image in about 1.5 seconds, which is a solid result when you consider that its power zoom lens must extend as it starts up. The camera focuses in about 0.1-second in bright light, and in 1.2 seconds in very dim conditions. The Sony Alpha 6000 is a little slower to start, requiring about 1.9 seconds, but focuses a bit quicker -- 0.02-second in bright light and 0.8-second in dim light.\n\nThe NX500 rattles off images at just about 9 frames per second. Its sensor has both phase and contrast focus support, so it can track fast action. When the camera is set to continuous AF the burst rate slows just a bit to 8fps, and while a few of the images in our moving target test scene were slightly out of focus, most were crisp and clear. The only real knock is that, if you're shooting in Raw or Raw+JPG mode, your bursts are limited to 6 shots, and even when tested with a fast SanDisk 280MBps memory card, it required 7.5 seconds (Raw+JPG) or 4.5 seconds (Raw) after a full burst to clear the buffer. Things are much better if you're a JPG shooter; the NX500 captures 45 images in a clip, and requires about 7.1 seconds to clear its buffer after a full burst. The Alpha 6000 is a little bit faster, at 11.1fps, and keeps that pace for 22 Raw+JPG or Raw images, or 48 JPG shots.\n\nSee How We Test Digital Cameras\n\nI used Imatest to check the sharpness of the included 16-50mm lens. When we first reviewed the lens with the 20-megapixel NX3000, we were happy with its performance. The NX500's 28-megapixel sensor also nets solid results, although the edges of the frame don't hold up quite as well. At 16mm f/3.5, the lens exceeds our 1,800-line sharpness requirement by a wide margin, showing 2,648 lines on a center-weighted test; but edges are a little murky, showing just 1,327 lines. Stopping down to f/5.6 improves performance across the frame (2,978 lines), and edges increase to a much more respectable 2,283 lines.\n\nAt 33mm f/5, the center-weighted average is a fine 2,208 lines, but edges are a bit dull at 1,525 lines; stopping down to f/8 shows only modest improvement -- the average score is 2,421 lines and edges show about 1,650 lines. When zoomed all the way in to 50mm, the lens shows about 1,934 lines at f/5.6, with edge performance around 1,600 lines. It's a better performer at f/8, with a center-weighed score of 2,398 lines and edges that are just shy of 2,000 lines. Distortion isn't a concern; the NX500 corrects for it when shooting in Raw or JPG. And we're not overly surprised to see some loss of fidelity at the periphery of the frame; other compact zoom designs like this one -- including the Sony 16-50mm -- show issues at the edges. But Samsung's take on this type of lens is still the best of the bunch.\n\nImatest also checks photos for noise, which can detract from details and add unwanted grain as the sensitivity to light (ISO) increases. Despite packing a lot of megapixels (28 of them) into an APS-C sensor, the NX500 manages to keep noise under 1.5 percent through ISO 12800. A BSI sensor design -- which puts less silicon between the lens and light-gathering photosites -- helps here, as does some in-camera noise reduction. I took a close look at photos from our ISO test scene on a calibrated NEC MultiSync PA271W display to see how well images held up when pushing the camera that far. At each full-stop setting beyond ISO 800, there's a slight drop in fidelity when shooting JPGs with default noise reduction settings enabled. But even so, images hold up pretty well through ISO 6400. ISO 12800 shows a bit too much softness and blurriness for my taste, but is still OK if you're looking to post photos to the Web. You should avoid ISO 25600 and 51200 when shooting JPG -- even with JPG noise reduction disabled in-camera, they suffer when compared with Raws processed using Lightroom.\n\nShooting in Raw is definitely the way to go if you're a high-ISO photographer. Even though there's noticeable noise at ISO 12800, detail is strong enough that I wouldn't hesitate to push it that far, even if I'm looking to print images. ISO 25600 is a bit rough, but still useable as well. Regardless of the format in which you shoot, it's a good idea to not crank to ISO 51200 if you can help it. The NX500 goes toe-to-toe with the Sony Alpha 6000 in terms of image quality at high ISOs; both cameras do a great job, and to my eye, the results are close enough to call high ISO quality a tie.\n\nLike the NX1, the NX500 can record 4K video (4,096-by-2,160) at 24fps, UHD video (3,840-by-2,160) at 30fps, and 1080p video at up to 60fps. But unlike its pricier sibling, the NX500 has to crop the active area of the sensor when shooting in 4K or UHD. It does so by roughly a 1.7x magnification, which limits your wide-angle coverage and requires you to do a bit of math to figure out the full-frame equivalent of any 4K footage that you may want to shoot, as the APS-C sensor already introduces a 1.5x crop when compared with full-frame. If you're shooting stills or 1080p footage at the widest setting of the included 16-50mm lens, it's like using a 24mm on a full-frame camera; switch to 4K and that turns into a 41mm field of view. That severely limits your wide-angle capabilities -- even if you own the Samsung 12-24mm f/4-5.6 ED, you're left with a moderate 31mm field of view.\n\nThat said, the MP4 footage does look spectacular, once you manage to transcode it to a format with which you can work. The h.265/HEVC codec employed by the NX500 isn't widely supported, so I used Wondershare to transcode the footage to a format which I could view on an iMac. Samsung includes a video converter as well -- it's accessible via the iLauncher interface that displays when you plug the camera into a computer via USB. You'll need to go through this even if you're just shooting in 1080p -- although that's sure to change with time as the h.265 codec is implemented in more computer systems. Transcoding is something that pro video shooters are used to, but in a consumer model like the NX500 it's off-putting. When you couple in the lack of a mic input -- a feature that pros demand -- it's even more confusing. Samsung used to sell the EM10 add-on mic for the older NX300, but it's no longer available, and there's no similar mic for the NX500.\n\nPlaying back videos in-camera works perfectly, though, and there is a micro HDMI port to connect to an HDTV. It's located right next to the micro USB port, which is used to recharge the battery. I was able to charge via my computer's USB port, or via the included AC adapter. If you're the type of photographer to invest in a spare battery, you should also consider getting a dedicated battery charger, otherwise you won't be able to use the NX500 as the battery charges. The camera supports standard SD, SDHC, and SDXC memory cards.", "Authorities have ordered Uber to suspend its activities in Brazil, and for app store operators to disable the product nationally, arguing that the San Francisco quasi-taxi company violates local transportation laws.\n\nThe injunction, issued Tuesday by Sao Paulo's State Court, is the latest in a series of international regulatory challenges presented to America's most valuable venture-backed start-up.\n\nThe court gave Uber three days to halt services nationwide or face fines of about $30,000 a day. Google, Samsung, Apple and Microsoft were ordered to cease delivering the application and to remotely suspend Uber apps already installed.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the app was active and offering a number of ride options for downtown Sao Paulo.\n\nA public relations company representing Uber in Sao Paulo said Wednesday that it had not been notified of the decision.\n\n\"Uber is a technology company that connects private partner drivers with users. We reiterate publicly that we are committed to offering Sao Paulo residents a safe and trustworthy urban transportation alternative,\" the company said by email.\n\nUber arrived in Brazil last May, and though many Brazilians use another app to order traditionally regulated taxis, Uber has been active and readily available in recent months, often offering lower prices than the taxi fleet.\n\nBrazil is Latin America's largest country, and the world's seventh-largest economy. Its over 200 million residents have provided a fertile market for other U.S.-based \"sharing economy\" services, such as Airbnb.\n\nUber has faced similar regulatory battles around the world, with Germany banning it last month, and South Korea, France and Spain have investigated the company for violating local transportation laws. Uber founder Travis Kalanick was indicted by South Korean prosecutors in December, charged with violating transportation laws.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times", "Technically Incorrect: A California man is flummoxed when AT&T insists he must pay a massive bill that he's sure he didn't deserve.\n\nTechnically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\n\nYes, these things can happen.\n\nBut it's what happens after they happen that often seems bemusing.\n\nIn this case, reported by the Los Angeles Times, 83-year-old Ron Dorff from Woodland Hills, Calif., got a disturbing bill in March from AT&T. It was for $8,596.57. Given that he reportedly thought he had a $51 a month subscription for quite pedestrian dial-up, he thought this was strange.\n\nHe reportedly explained this to AT&T, who reportedly said it would send a technician. A technician who was slower than the dial-up. He allegedly never arrived at all.\n\nThe bills reportedly kept on coming. And increasing. Until they reached $24,298.16. He called AT&T. A rep told him he had to pay.\n\nAt this point, he contacted the Los Angeles Times. Strangely, the minute its David Lazarus called AT&T, the company insisted that the bill would be waived and it was already in the process of doing so before the reporter called.\n\nEven more strangely, AT&T has sent large, slightly inexplicable bills before.\n\nA few years ago, I received an e-mail from the mother of Evan Brainerd, a US Army captain stationed in Afghanistan. One of his soldiers, Pfc. Jose Rivera, had received a $16,000 AT&T bill. AT&T stood firm that it should be paid. When I contacted AT&T, the bill magically evaporated.\n\nThis isn't to single out AT&T. These stories surely happen in many businesses, inside and outside the telecom industry. What is perplexing is why, when a strange bill appears in front of a customer service agent, they don't consider that the source of the strangeness might be the company itself.\n\nMore Technically Incorrect Ranger uses Taser on man flying drone in national park Houston Rockets cause outrage with horseshoot tweet Samsung purportedly takes poke at Apple fanboys searching for iPhone 6S\n\nIn Dorff's case, it seems that his dial-up was constantly dialing up a long-distance number for no apparently sane reason.\n\n\"The charges were due to our customer not using a local phone number option for dial-up connection to his Internet access provider,\" and AT&T spokesman confirmed. \"We have waived the charges and explained to him how to use a local number to reach his service.\"\n\nHowever, I still wonder how charges like these are allowed to escalate without a sufficiently thorough suspicion that it might not be the customer's fault.\n\nWhen American Express, for example, sees a strange amount being charged to my account, it e-mails and/or calls to ask whether I really have just spent $842 on books written in Norwegian. (I apologize, and they tell me not to do it again.) Would it be so difficult for phone companies to be this proactive?\n\nYes, some customers don't tell the truth. Some take their phones abroad and think the charges will be the same as they are at home. (Which they should be, but somehow aren't.)\n\nBut how likely is it that an 83-year-old man with dial-up is going to rack up $24,000 worth of charges?\n\nAT&T says it is \"Mobilizing Your World.\" That's surely more positive than bankrupting it.\n\nUpdate at 1:06 p.m. PT: with statement from AT&T.", "With all the complex technologies that help make flat panel monitors and flat-screen televisions, well, flat, it's no surprise there's some confusion about exactly what's happening behind our favorite screens.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new TV or monitor, it's helpful to know what all the acronyms and spec-speak actually means for your viewing and using experience. Maybe you already appreciate the price differences between LED Full Array and LED Direct Lit TVs, but once you know how these configurations really work, you'll really start seeing their value in a completely different light.\n\nTips: How do you know what type of panel is in your screen? Easy - just check the product page on the manufacturer's website or any instructional information that came with it.\n\nThere's a lot of confusion and misconceptions about the science of panels, so this display explainer aims to give a basic breakdown of the types of displays available today. It's our hope that by the end of our two-page primer you'll be officially certified to school friends and family in screen tech 101. Plus, when it's time to go shopping for a new TV or monitor, you'll be fully informed as to what you're buying.\n\nOne last note on resolution before we get started: All the panels listed - with the exception of plasma - can produce a 4K picture, but nowadays most screens typically come at resolutions of 1920 x 1080, though it's not a hard and fast rule.\n\nNow that we have that cleared up, let's start with the basics: LCDs.\n\nLCD and Light Polarization\n\nIt's no surprise that one of the oldest flat-panel technologies is also the one with the most variant off-shoots. But to understand liquid crystal displays (LCD) you have to first wrap your head around the concept of light polarization.\n\nPolarizing light works like a filter to block and isolate specific light waves. This is why polarized sunglasses are popular, since they block out sunlight through super tiny slits that essentially stops light in its tracks.\n\nIn simple terms, light waves travel vertically and horizontally, and polarized glass uses the slits to block out one of these waves at any given time.\n\nWhen that specific light wave passes through the glass, it can only pass through polarized glass if it is in the same orientation (horizontal or vertical) as the glass. Layers within LCD displays are oriented to let in one of these types of light waves.\n\nLCD variations - TN, VA, IPS and PLS explained\n\nThere are several kinds of LCD displays found in today's TVs and monitors. The distinction is often not spelled out clearly on a spec sheet, but knowing what kind of display you're shopping for can make for smarter purchasing decisions.\n\nTN - Stands for Twisted Nematic, which is one of the most common types of LCDs. Its application in consumer devices use dates back to the late 1960s and traditional TN displays can still be found today in calculators, alarm clocks and budget media players. In other words, most consumer electronics you can find in a drug store.\n\nLCD is comprised of a material known as nematic liquid crystal, which is the substance that's placed between plates of polarized glass.\n\nIt gets its name from the liquid crystal's reaction to an electric field. The absence of such a field twists the cell 90 degrees. Conversely, the presence of an electric field (after voltage is applied to the electrodes) forces the liquid crystal molecules to align with the field.\n\nIn layman's terms that means the presence of electrical current allows light to pass through, while the lack of current means the pixel stays dark.\n\nHow you can explain it to mom: Light travels one of two ways: horizontally and vertically. TN technology works as a kind of \"light dam\" that controls when light does and does not pass, and whether you have a lit pixel or a pixel devoid of light on your screen. Twisted nematic literally twists its light filter horizontally or vertically to block light or to let it go through.\n\nDevices you find it in: Digital watches, calculators, car instrument panel displays, first-generation flat-panel computer monitors as well as various monitors today.\n\nVA - Stands for Vertical Alignment. It's often considered the middle child of the group between TN panels and IPS displays.\n\nLike Twisted Nematic panels, Vertical Alignment panels use liquid crystals and electrical current to tilt polarized glass but have a slightly altered manufacturing process. The result is a deeper black background, better image quality, and a higher contrast ratio over traditional twisted nematic displays.\n\nAs a group, vertically aligned liquid crystal molecules are more organized than TN molecules, which are neither fully vertical nor horizontal. This results in better control of light and less light leakage in VA displays. If you like great viewing angles and dark blacks, and don't mind average response time, VA monitors are fine options.\n\nHow you can explain it to mom: VA monitors are better than TN panels, but still not the best LCD screen you can get.\n\nDevices you find it in: Computer monitors. You'll find them next to IPS and TN displays at the electronic store.\n\nIPS - Short for In-Plane Switching, IPS was primarily designed to solve TN's limitations, including limited viewing angles and color reproduction.\n\nWhereas TN liquid crystals slide around the panels of glass, IPS liquid crystals are kept in place using an electrical field. To generate this field, IPS panels need twice as much electricity to power the increased number of transistors. As a result, IPS displays consume more power than TN displays.\n\nLike Vertical Alignment, In-Plane Switching controls liquid crystal molecules better than Twisted Nematic. To be \"in-plane\" also means to be parallel with the glass outer layers, which leads to more focused light.\n\nHow you can explain it to mom: IPS panels have the best color reproduction of any standard LCD display. The contrast isn't as good as LCD LED displays, but IPS panels are usually cheaper.\n\nDevices you find it in: Computer monitors, competing with VA and TN displays.\n\nPLS - Plane-to-Line Switching technically falls under the IPS classification. The only notable difference is that PLS is manufactured exclusively by Samsung, which claims that PLS is more cost-efficient to produce than IPS.\n\nWith similar response times and contrast ratios, PLS is generally considered similar in nature to IPS, just manufactured by one company.\n\nThat's not to say it's only found in Samsung monitors, though. Samsung makes PLS panels for other device manufacturers like Dell, AOC and even Philips.\n\nHow you can explain it to mom: PLS is a tweaked version of IPS branded by Samsung.\n\nDevices you find it in: Primarily Samsung computer monitors, although Dell, AOC, and Philips buy PLS panels from Samsung for their screens as well.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- Optional leather backs and manual camera controls are two ways LG is seeking to distinguish its new G4 phone from Apple's iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy smartphones.\n\nLG's mobile chief, Juno Cho, said a wireless trade show in Barcelona, Spain, last month confirmed LG's belief that smartphones have become clones of one another.\n\n\"I was almost shocked,\" Cho told The Associated Press. \"Almost all the phones on display and introduced looked very (much the) same -- the same metal casing and emphasis on thinness, overall form factors that are very similar.\"\n\nThe message at Tuesday's announcement of the new G4: We're not like the others.\n\nApple and Samsung dominate the smartphone market, with LG Electronics Inc. and other companies vying for third place with market shares of less than 5 percent each.\n\nLG will make phones with traditional backs, too -- using metal or ceramic. Prices weren't announced, though LG said leather models will cost more in some markets. The G4 is available immediately in LG's home country of South Korea. It will debut around the world in the coming weeks and is expected to reach the U.S. in early June.\n\nApple has long made design a priority, while Samsung began to embrace that this spring with phones that sport a metal frame and a glass back, rather than the plastic used in previous models. In many ways, Samsung's new Galaxy S6 came to resemble Apple's older iPhones. (The iPhone now has metal backs.)\n\nAt Tuesday's announcement, LG made a dig at Samsung, without naming it, by pointing out that glass backs can be marred with fingerprints. The G4 will have a choice of leather finishes. Some of Samsung's older phones had imitation leather backs. The G4 uses real leather and has stitching down the middle -- for looks, more than anything.\n\nIf leather isn't for you, metal and ceramic backs are options. Motorola's Moto X phone offers leather, wood and other non-traditional materials as made-to-order options. With LG, they are part of standard models.\n\nLG is adding features to improve low-light images. These are improvements over the average smartphone, though Apple and Samsung have also been incorporating these features -- namely, the inclusion of a lens that can open wider to let in more light and reduce blur.\n\nThe G4 also has a plethora of manual controls, rivaling those of full-body cameras known as single-lens reflex, or SLR. LG said no other major smartphone released \"this year\" has that capability. LG was careful about the phrasing, as older phones from Nokia -- now part of Microsoft -- have that level of control. The feature was popular among some experienced photographers, though most people are fine with automatic settings.\n\nThe G4 differs in letting people save images in RAW format, which permits a greater degree of editing. Most cameras use JPEG, which takes less storage space but introduces distortion in the compression.\n\nOne nice feature is the ability to snap a photo by pressing the power button on the back twice, even if the phone's display is off. Samsung's S6 launches the camera with the double press of the home button, but the user still has to then take the shot. LG also made a dig at Samsung for this, without naming the company.\n\nAs much as LG tries to be different, the layout of the G4's photo gallery resembles the iPhone's. In an interview, Cho said LG \"felt that kind of experience is important for the customer.\"\n\nFew phones have removable batteries these days, in part to keep phones thin. LG sacrificed thinness so the battery can be removed and replaced with a spare. The G4 also has a slot for a memory card -- something lacking in the iPhone and S6 phones. LG keeps the slot -- especially important if people start storing all their photos in RAW.", "LG Electronics Inc. says its quarterly profit has plunged 59 per cent from a year earlier with losses from TVs offsetting a modest improvement in its smartphone business.\n\nTHE Korean company said on Wednesday its January-March net profit fell to 38.4 billion won ($A44.88 million) from 92.6 billion won a year earlier. Sales were flat at 14 trillion won while operating profit slumped 37 per cent to 305 billion won. Its TV business lost money as weak currencies in emerging markets sapped demand. LG sold a record high number of smartphones but its mobile profit was thin. Even after selling 15.4 million smartphones, up 26 per cent, the division's operating profit margin was just 2 per cent. Apple's margin was more than 20 per cent while Samsung's was about 10 per cent.", "Samsung reclaims the smartphone crown from Apple, but faces uphill battle anyway\n\nSamsung has clawed back its crown from Apple as the world's biggest smartphone seller by volume, but it still has a long way to go to reclaim its golden years.\n\nWhile still on top of the industry, the Korea-based tech giant posted yet another profit decline on Wednesday, its fourth-consecutive quarter of declines. The $4.3 billion it made in the first quarter of 2015 is 39% lower than the same period in 2014.\n\nSamsung has been hit by what Neil Mawston, executive director of Strategy Analytics, called a \"pincer movement.\" Competition on the high end of the market from Apple and the low end from Chinese upstarts like Huawei have pinched Samsung's business.\n\n\"It's taken several quarters for Samsung to react to [the competition] and to create products to slow down that attack,\" Mawston said. \"Samsung probably has another year or two of work to say they've recovered.\"\n\nTo do this, Samsung is banking on its new high-end products -- notably the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge -- to compete with Apple's iPhone 6 and 6+ and help get the company back on track.\n\nSamsung and Apple were in a dead heat at the end of 2014 for the number of smartphones shipped.\n\nApple caught up partly due to an unexpectedly steep decline in Samsung's sales of the S5, its previous flagship phone. The decline was so severe that J.K. Shin, head of the company's mobile business, is still considerably lower than the same period last year.\n\nSamsung's newest flagship phones - bigger and flashier - are meant to reverse the trend. Those phones just went on sale in the U.S. and have a retail price from $600 to more than $1,000, and enthusiasm from company executives for the new phones have sent the company's stock price higher.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple's earnings continue to soar thanks to its tightening grip on the high-end smartphone market. Apple has also enjoyed significant growth on Samsung's turf, with sales in China growing 72%.\n\nApple also dominates Samsung in a very important metric -- how much money it makes from each smartphone sold. Samsung may sell more phones, but Apple makes more money per phone. Apple's gross margin, which takes into account how much money is spent in comparison to cash brought in, is a whopping 40.8%. Samsung's is well below that, at around 35%, though it is starting to edge back up.\n\nApple makes for a formidable opponent, but Samsung has also been facing growing competition from companies closer to its headquarters in Korea.\n\nChinese smartphone manufacturers -- most notably Huawei and Xiaomi -- have taken a big chunk out of the lower, more inexpensive end of the smartphone market that had been an important source of money for Samsung.\n\nIn response, Samsung developed new low-cost phones including the India-focused Z1 that costs $92.\n\nSamsung executives said Wednesday that the company was preparing to go on the offensive in emerging markets with mid- and low-end smartphones.\n\nThere's some signs that Samsung's turnaround efforts are starting to work.\n\nThe company's mobile profit has actually increased over the last couple quarters -- far better than the declines of early and mid-2014.\n\nJeff Orr, an analyst for ABI Research, said that Samsung has spent years investing in making its own smartphone parts such as microchips and screens. That should mean its can make more money from each phone, since it does not need to rely on outside suppliers.\n\n\"All of that work and all of that investment that the company has had on the high end will be trickling down to the other designs and hopefully yield better cost control,\" he said.\n\nThe company is still far from in the clear. In fact, its current situation may be more indicative of a new normal. The lower end of the market will continue to be competitive, while Samsung will still have to deal with Apple.\n\nAppealing to such a large group of consumers, Orr said, will be difficult.\n\n\"Samsung has to compete with every Android and Windows phone company out there,\" Orr said. \"It has to really balance itself across the needs of a great market.\"", "IDC said Samsung sold 82.4 million smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5 per cent market share.\n\nEven though the number sold was down 7 per cent from a year ago, Samsung outpaced Apple, whose iPhone sales slipped slightly from the final quarter of 2014.\n\nApple held an 18.2 per cent market share in early 2015 after selling 61.2 million iPhones.\n\nThe figures were impacted by seasonal and other factors. Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple and Samsung were virtually tied with around 20 per cent of the market each, according to several surveys.\n\n\"The challenge made by Apple for the top spot in the fourth quarter returned to a clear lead for Samsung in the first quarter, despite the soaring global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,\" IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said.\n\n\"Samsung's shipments, given that the S6 was not launched into the market for the full quarter, were driven by large volumes into emerging markets and steady demand for its mid-range and lower-priced smartphones.\"\n\nChinese manufacturer Lenovo was third after completing its acquisition of Motorola from Google. Its 5.6 per cent market share placed it ahead of fellow Chinese group Huawei, with 5.0 per cent, and South Korea's LG at 4.6 per cent.\n\nIDC said the overall global smartphone market grew 16.7 per cent from a year earlier, with total shipments of 337 million units.\n\nThe IDC survey results looked at handset sales numbers rather than sales revenue.", "SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft Corp is set to allow apps from rival Google Inc's Android system onto its own Windows phones later this year in an attempt to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move would mark a radical shift in strategy for Microsoft, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones because they have so few users, and few people use the phones because there are fewer apps than on Android or Apple Inc phones.\n\nFollow live coverage of Microsoft's Build conference below.

Fast forward to 2015 and Microsoft's grand future vision is on the cusp of becoming reality.\n\nAt Build, Microsoft's annual developer conference held here at San Francisco's Moscone Center, the company spent the better part of the morning on Wednesday talking up new dev tools and monetization pipelines for Windows 10, Azure, and Office. In a rare bit of showmanship for Redmond, the software giant saved its most exciting bit for last -- an eye-popping showcase of HoloLens.\n\nHoloLens is an augmented-reality headset that runs on Microsoft's next-gen operating system, turning the world around you into a holographic wonderland where virtual objects and information overlays float in the physical space before your very eyes. Unlike virtual reality platforms like the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR, which bring you into a full-blown virtual world but blind you to your surroundings, HoloLens lets you see the real world around you but adds virtual elements to it which you can manipulate to a certain degree.\n\nMicrosoft's holographic interface is still in the prototype phase. At Build, the company gave no concrete indication as to when it might become commercially available, instead treating conference attendees to a sort of progress report on the state of the technology, hosted by HoloLens project head Alex Kipman.\n\nThe big news Wednesday was that Microsoft, after years of tinkering with the technology in its own labs, is starting to let outsiders play around with its hologram toys. Kipman lifted the curtain on the Windows Holographic Platform, a toolkit for developers to create HoloLens apps for Windows 10.\n\nAs with other Windows 10 products and services, HoloLens will be part of Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform integration, with holographic apps working across all devices and screen sizes supporting the next-gen OS, Kipman said.\n\nMeanwhile, a few lucky Microsoft partners have already been working with the company to develop demo apps for HoloLens -- in all instances, to stunning effect.\n\n\"The portability of experiences, enabled by Windows 10, can change the way that makers like you interact with the physical things that you build,\" Kipman said before overseeing a procession of HoloLens demos during Build's opening keynote.\n\nThere was Miko, a simple, Raspberry Pi-powered robot with an expressive, holographic avatar ready to follow orders at its operator's command. Kipman's team also collaborated with Case Western University's Cleveland Clinic to create a holographic biology lesson which built a virtual man's body up, layer by layer, from skeleton to skin.\n\nPerhaps the most immediately useful HoloLens application for many of us will be a nifty little trick Microsoft has cooked up to turn a living room into a living PC, allowing HoloLens wearers to move their holographically represented desktop displays to and from surfaces like tables and walls, and even manipulate what's happening on those screens with gestures and voice.\n\nHoloLens owes much to Microsoft's Kinect sensor for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, which Kipman also developed. The headset maps physical space using scanning technology created for Kinect. PCMag had a hands on with HoloLens back in January. Based on Kipman's presentation, it looks like some of the bugginess of that earlier version has been smoothed out, but we'll be demoing HoloLens again here at Build to get a better read on how far this exciting new interface has come in the past few months, so stay tuned.", "Samsung, which has just released weak first-quarter earnings, has a currency problem. After a 12 month period during which South Korea's won advanced 23 percent against the euro, Samsung is having trouble maintaining its sales. But the won has also declined in value against the U.S. dollar, which has raised the company's materials costs.\n\nSamsung's profits, in other words, are getting crushed between two separate negative exchange rate dynamics. And to top it off, Apple, Samsung's primary competitor in cell phone sales, has just released a product, the iPhone 6, that's dominating the industry.\n\nThe situation adds a new wrinkle to a famous observation that Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-Hee made in 2007. Taking stock of Korea's recovery from the Asian crisis a decade earlier, Kim warned \"we are sandwiched\" between highly-developed Japan and low-cost China. Kim called for an innovation boom to support Korea's continued economic rise. Samsung's recent travails (profits slumped 40 percent last quarter, the sixth straight quarterly decline) couldn't have been what Kim had in mind.\n\nThere's a reason you don't see Apple CEO Tim Cook sweating over exchange rates: His company's innovative products have earned the status of luxury objects. Even when Apple copies Samsung's shtick -- by offering a bigger screen on its iPhone 6, for example \u00ad-- the company's reputation as an innovator remains unscathed.\n\nSamsung, by contrast, has never managed to create any game-changing product -- a Korean-made Walkman or iPhone, say -- that would grant it protection from currency fluctuations. The company has found plenty of success in the unsexy business of making supplies for competitors, including Apple, but that's not the sort of reputation that allows it to charge consumers a premium.\n\nLee Jae Yong, who is poised to replace his hospitalized father as Samsung's boss, seems to have taken heed. He has been unwinding the company's holdings in disappointing sectors like defense; moving talent from mobile phones to Internet initiatives; and making ambitious bets on new products, including bio-pharmaceuticals, memory chips, batteries and organic light-emitting diode displays.\n\nSamsung has also placed a new emphasis on cutting-edge design. The company's new Galaxy 6 phone is a design marvel, and although first quarter sales were underwhelming, Samsung is counseling patience. The second quarter, it says, will look better, with indications that the new smartphone is starting to sell briskly.\n\nBut Lee's maneuvers still risk shortchanging his company. The biggest question facing Samsung isn't where it will be three or four quarters from now, but three or four years from now. Say what you want about Sony or Sharp sliding toward irrelevance, but in their heyday those iconic Japanese companies changed the tech world by staying one step ahead of shifts in consumer markets.\n\nIn that sense, Samsung should be focused less on Apple than scrappy upstarts like China's Xiaomi, which is producing low-cost cell phones that are especially popular in its home market. The average price for Samsung's headsets are currently around $200, but, in order to better compete in Asia's biggest economy, the company should probably think about lowering costs.\n\nKorea's strong won could and should catalyze positive changes for Samsung, and the broader Korean economy. But that will demand that the country's corporate chieftains quit blaming the Bank of Korea for their woes and instead get in touch with their inner entrepreneurs. By making investments in research and development and encouraging greater risk taking among their employees, they could enliven Korean growth and make their companies less vulnerable to the whims of currency traders.\n\nThey should also take advantage of the won's relative strength among the currencies of eastern Asia. The yen's 12 percent drop versus the won over the last 12 months means it's possible to imagine Japan's tech powers of yesteryear, like Sony and Sharp, being acquired by an ambitious Korean CEO like Lee. Such a move would certainly take Samsung's competitors by surprise -- and it might even help the company escape the uncomfortable currency bind it has found itself in.\n\nTo contact the author on this story:\n\nWilliam Pesek at wpesek@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor on this story:\n\nCameron Abadi at cabadi2@bloomberg.net", "Seoul, South Korea - Samsung's global sales and profits fell in the first quarter, and the company's consumer electronics division posted an operating loss.\n\nConsolidated sales were off 12.2 percent to 47.1 trillion won ($44 billion) compared to the year-ago quarter, while operating profits slipped 30 percent to 5.98 trillion won ($5.6 billion).

Consumers have been switching to Apple's larger iPhones and cheaper Chinese devices as the rising South Korean won makes Samsung products more expensive abroad.\n\nMaking chips and screens for its own mobile devices while also supplying rivals may help Samsung blunt the impact of sales gains by Apple, which this week posted a surge in earnings. The Galaxy S6 phones, including the more expensive Edge with a wraparound display, were released this month to positive reviews and strong demand said to have prompted an acceleration of curved-screen output.\n\n\"The second quarter will be brighter as mobile earnings are expected to improve, largely driven by the increased sales of the S6,\" said Greg Roh, a Seoul-based analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. \"The pricier Edge device will take up half of the total S6 shipment from May, and that will give a strong lift to its mobile business.\"\n\nSamsung's net income, excluding minority interests, fell 40 per cent to 4.52 trillion won ($4.2 billion US) in the quarter ended March, the company said.\n\nSamsung, the world's biggest chipmaker, said it should capitalize on stronger demand for the semiconductors used in mobile phones and servers.\n\n\"In the second quarter, the company expects its overall earnings to increase,\" it said. \"In 2015, continued growth is expected due to the growth of emerging smartphone markets, such as China and India.\"\n\nOperating profit at the mobile-phone unit fell 57 per cent to 2.74 trillion won in the first quarter as Apple won high-end customers.\n\nSamsung shipped 83.2 million smartphones in the March quarter, helping it regain the title of world's biggest vendor after dropping into a tie with Apple in the December period, according to Strategy Analytics.

Apple and Samsung dominate the smartphone market, with LG Electronics Inc. and other companies vying for third place with market shares of less than 5 percent each.\n\nLG will make phones with traditional backs, too - using metal or ceramic. Prices weren't announced, though LG said leather models will cost more in some markets. The G4 is available immediately in LG's home country of South Korea. It will debut around the world in the coming weeks and is expected to reach the US in early June.\n\nHere's how the G4 stacks up:\n\nThe design\n\nApple has long made design a priority, while Samsung began to embrace that this spring with phones that sport a metal frame and a glass back, rather than the plastic used in previous models. In many ways, Samsung's new Galaxy S6 came to resemble Apple's older iPhones. (The iPhone now has metal backs.)\n\nAt Tuesday's announcement, LG made a dig at Samsung, without naming it, by pointing out that glass backs can be marred with fingerprints. The G4 will have a choice of leather finishes. Some of Samsung's older phones had imitation leather backs. The G4 uses real leather and has stitching down the middle - for looks, more than anything.\n\nIf leather isn't for you, metal and ceramic backs are options. Motorola's Moto X phone offers leather, wood and other non-traditional materials as made-to-order options. With LG, they are part of standard models.\n\nThe camera\n\nLG is adding features to improve low-light images. These are improvements over the average smartphone, though Apple and Samsung have also been incorporating these features - namely, the inclusion of a lens that can open wider to let in more light and reduce blur.\n\nThe G4 also has a plethora of manual controls, rivaling those of full-body cameras known as single-lens reflex, or SLR. LG said no other major smartphone released \"this year\" has that capability. LG was careful about the phrasing, as older phones from Nokia - now part of Microsoft - have that level of control. The feature was popular among some experienced photographers, though most people are fine with automatic settings.\n\nThe G4 differs in letting people save images in RAW format, which permits a greater degree of editing. Most cameras use JPEG, which takes less storage space but introduces distortion in the compression.\n\nOne nice feature is the ability to snap a photo by pressing the power button on the back twice, even if the phone's display is off. Samsung's S6 launches the camera with the double press of the home button, but the user still has to then take the shot. LG also made a dig at Samsung for this, without naming the company.\n\nAs much as LG tries to be different, the layout of the G4's photo gallery resembles the iPhone's. In an interview, Cho said LG \"felt that kind of experience is important for the customer.\"\n\nExtras\n\nFew phones have removable batteries these days, in part to keep phones thin. LG sacrificed thinness so the battery can be removed and replaced with a spare. The G4 also has a slot for a memory card - something lacking in the iPhone and S6 phones. LG keeps the slot - especially important if people start storing all their photos in RAW. - AP", "SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will allow apps from rival Google Inc's Android system onto its own Windows phones later this year to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple Inc phones.\n\nAllowing Android apps onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap. But the strategy runs the risk of making Windows phones less attractive if they are merely seen as emulations of Android devices.\n\n\"The only approach to succeed today is to recognize the multiple developer ecosystems out there,\" said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC.\n\nMicrosoft executive Terry Myerson made the announcement at the company's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.\n\nHe said Windows phones will run a subsystem which would enable them to run apps written in Android code, although the phones would still use extensions provided by Windows.\n\nFor example, an Android restaurant-finding app would automatically use Microsoft's Bing maps for directions rather than Google's maps, as it would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also said Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple, meaning that it should be easy for developers to bring their iOS apps to Windows phones.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung, control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones.\n\nMicrosoft shares fell 0.4 percent to $48.96 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)", "The Dell UltraSharp U34215W is a huge, 34-inch, curved-screen monitor that delivers outstanding performance and is packed with features.\n\nCurved-screen monitors haven't quite taken the market by storm, but they are beginning to trickle in. With the UltraSharp U3415W ($1,199.99), Dell joins LG and Samsung in releasing a gargantuan, 34-inch, ultra-wide, curved display designed to bring enhanced panoramic viewing to the desktop. This monitor uses In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel technology to deliver rich, accurate colors and solid gray-scale performance, with wide viewing angles. It is equipped with numerous I/O ports and offers a USB hub and daisy-chaining capabilities, and it comes with a height-adjustable stand. The U3415W doesn't come cheap, but you get a lot of monitor and great performance for your money. It's our top pick for ultra-wide monitors.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nDell's UltraSharp monitors have always maintained a pleasing aesthetic, but the U3415W takes it to another level with a slick, (mostly) bezel-free design that makes the gigantic 34-inch panel look even larger than it already is. The U3415W does sport a thin (3/4-inch), matte-black bottom bezel that holds a Dell logo, four touch-sensitive function buttons, and a Power switch, but the top and side bezels are practically microscopic.\n\nThe slightly curved 34-inch Wide Quad High Definition (WQHD) panel has a maximum resolution of 3,440-by-1,440, a 300-nit brightness level, and a 21:9 aspect ratio. It is housed in an 18.6-pound, matte-black cabinet measuring 32.5 by 14.7 by 3 inches (HWD), and it has a non-reflective, anti-glare coating. The cabinet is supported by a square, silver stand with a mounting arm that gives you 4.5 inches of height, 60 degrees of swivel, and 26 degrees of tilt maneuverability. By way of comparison, the LG 34UC97-S offers tilt adjustability, but lacks support for height and swivel adjustments. The U3415W has a pair of 9-watt speakers that are very loud and deliver robust, distortion-free audio. You don't get booming bass with these speakers, but they do provide enough bottom to keep from sounding tinny.\n\nYou get a boatload of ports with this monitor, including two full-size DisplayPort connectors (one in and one out) that allow you to daisy-chain multiple monitors, a mini-DisplayPort input, an HDMI 2.0 input, a separate Mobile High Definition (MHL) input for connecting to and charging smartphones and tablets, an audio line-out for external speakers, and six USB 3.0 ports, two of which are upstream connectors that allow you to share a keyboard and mouse with two PCs. My only gripe here is that all of the USB ports are at the rear of the cabinet; a few side-mounted ports would make it easier to plug and unplug peripherals like thumb drives and MP3 players.\n\nThe U3415W offers plenty of basic and advanced picture settings and a user-friendly menu system. In addition to Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma settings, there are seven picture presets (Standard, Multimedia, Movie, Game, Paper, Color Temp, and Custom). If you choose the Custom setting, you can tweak Offset and Gain levels for red, green, and blue colors, as well as Hue and Saturation levels for red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, and magenta colors. Other adjustments include Sharpness, Dynamic Contrast, Picture-in-Picture (PIP), and Picture-by-Picture (PBP) settings, as well as a calibrated Uniformity Compensation setting that adjust all areas of the screen to maintain uniform brightness and color with respect to the center of the screen.\n\nThe U3415W comes with a 3-year warranty on parts, labor, and backlight. Included in the box are a mini-DisplayPort cable, an HDMI cable, and an upstream USB cable. You also get a printed Quick Start Guide and a CD containing a User Guide, drivers, and Dell's Display Manager software, which allows you to change picture presets using a mouse and keyboard and apply presets to specific applications. It also contains an Easy Arrange utility that lets you use predefined or custom window layouts.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe U3415W delivers very accurate colors out of the box. As shown on the chromaticity chart below, red, green, and blue colors (represented by the colored dots) are all very closely aligned with their ideal CIE coordinates (represented by the boxes). As is usually the case with quality IPS panels, colors appear evenly saturated and rich in tone. Gray-scale performance is also top-notch; the panel had no trouble reproducing every shade of gray on the DisplayMate 64-Step Gray-Scale test and displayed intricate highlight and shadow detail on my test images.\n\nAs was the case with the LG 34UC97-S, the U3415W's curved screen brings you a bit closer to the action while gaming or watching movies. Playing Call of Duty: Black Ops on the big screen was exhilarating, as was watching Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier on Blu-ray. The 34-inch, wide-screen is ideal for users who typically work with several windows open, as well as those who work with large documents or spreadsheets.\n\nThe panel's 5-millisecond pixel response keeps ghosting to a minimum, but doesn't eliminate it completely. I observed slight ghosting while playing Burnout Paradise on the Sony PS3 console but only when the background was very dark. Input lag (the time it takes for the monitor to react to a controller command) is a non-issue, thanks to the U3415W's low 10.5-millisecond lag time (as measured with a Leo Bodnar Lag Tester).", "The phones that make you go: MWauuauuuughghAARGH!\n\nHow do you make a phone that stands out?

That's right, real bonafide leather made of the skin of dead animals.\n\nDon't think about it too much or it might make you a bit queasy. Not only that but you can get your LG G4 in an array of retina-searing colours. Is it classy or just about the creakiest phone design decision of the last 12 months? We're honestly not sure yet.\n\nHowever, it's far from the worst mistake we've seen in our time looking over the world of phones.

And just as the original The Matrix thrust the all-time classic Nokia 8100 into the spotlight, The Matrix Reloaded saw Samsung have a stab at another 'movie' phone: the $500 Samsung NPH-N270 Matrix.\n\nIt was meant to be the futuristic phone of our daydreams. It was, well, horrible. Looking like something that belongs on the building site of a Mad Max-style apocalypse rather than a catwalk.\n\nThe over-designed speaker flips up and out of the tiny screen while the phone's body is needlessly bulked out. It looks less like a prop from the classy Matrix movies, more like a reject from Batman & Robin. Ouch.\n\nPrev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Virgin Mobile Lobster 700TV\n\nRelease date: 2006\n\nDude, there's something on your shoulder. No, seriously, there's a great big lump coming out of your neck. Never has a phone looked so much as it has inadvertently grown an unfortunate puss-filled cyst on its side than the Virgin Mobile Lobster 700TV.\n\nSo... why? Well, the 700TV was among a mercifully small group of phones that tried to offer more than just phone features years before app stores as we now know them exploded, and the lump was needed to fit in the extra hardware and controls for a DAB radio and TV tuner.\n\nThat's right, the Virgin Mobile Lobster 700TV could receive digital radio and Freeview TV. Sounds pretty neat now, doesn't it? While we'd kinda like these features back now, please, they didn't change the world back in 2007 with this \u00a3199 lumpy monstrosity.\n\nWasn't that expensive, though.\n\nPrev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Siemens Xelibri 6\n\nRelease date: 2003\n\nHave you ever wanted a phone that doubles as a make-up compact? Of course you haven't. Well that's what Siemens had a crack at with the Xelibri 6.\n\nThis was just one phone from a range obnoxiously and reductively aimed at a female audience. You can probably imagine the focus group that came up with it now.\n\nPeople that use phones every day are busy and don't have the time to pamper themselves before the work commute. So why can't they do it on the way to work?\n\nFair enough, we've all seen someone sort out their mascara on the train. But do you want your phone to look like a mirror-clad oyster shell that won't even fit in your pocket? Thought not.\n\nPrev Page 4 of 11 Next Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Vertu Signature Cobra\n\nRelease date: 2006\n\nLuxury phones are a bit of a tough sell for the normal person when standard top-end ones cost the same as many of us spent on our first cars. That's Vertu's game, though.\n\nIt makes phones for people who pop Cristal just for the sound of the cork flying out. And sometimes it produces amazing-looking devices. But other times it goes...the wrong way.\n\nThe Vertu Signature Cobra was its nadir. It's like Vertu took a good-looking phone, clad it with gold and then filled a piping bag full of dog mess and made a snake-snaped frame for the thing, finishing it off with glitter and sequins.\n\nMaybe some people are so rich that normal rules of taste and decency don't apply. But there's a limit. To top it off, the thing cost $310,000/\u00a3213,000 and that was back in 2006.\n\nPrev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Motorola V100\n\nRelease date: 2000\n\nHaven't you always wanted a phone that looks like a toy picked up at the airport to silence a 5-year-old on a flight to Magaluf? No? Well that's what the Motorola V100 seemed to be about.\n\nTranslucent blue plastic and more cheap rubbery buttons make us wonder: who is this for exactly?\n\nWell, back in 2000 when the phone was released it was designed to appeal to SMS addicts who found T9 typing just not, well, enough.\n\nFor those not born in the '80s, SMS'ing is texting and T9 was how we used to type out messages before everything from gaming to tax returns was done on touchscreens. Kids today don't even know they're born.\n\nPrev Page 6 of 11 Next Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Kyocera Blade\n\nRelease date: 2003\n\nSometimes trying hard backfires. Back in 2003 Sony Ericsson was the king of style phones. That's right: Sony didn't make phones on its own back in those days.\n\nHowever, in trying to nick some of the style cues Sony Ericsson established, Kyocera went way overboard, making a phone that'd make you cringe rather than go 'ooh', in the Blade.\n\nIt's no wonder Kyocera phones never really took off. At 23mm thick it was also chunky enough to fill a pocket alone. That's even thicker than some of the construction site-ready phones Kyocera makes these days.\n\nPrev Page 7 of 11 Next Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Samsung Upstage\n\nRelease date: 2007\n\nUntil Android kicked off and the Galaxy series took hold, Samsung was left clutching at straws in the mobile world. Even Motorola had bags more success. But it wasn't for lack of trying on Samsung's part.\n\nTake the Samsung Upstage from 2007. Even the name suggests it thought it was going to wipe the floor with everything else and start a phone revolution.\n\nWhat was it? A naff candy bar phone with an extra screen and bonus buttons on the back that made it a Jekyll & Hyde monster, a phone and MP3 player hybrid. No surprise: it was a total flop.\n\nLet's not forget, this was the same year the iPhone launched. Samsung comes up with a lot of ideas. Not all of them are golden. Not nearly all of them. It launched for $150 with a contract in the US.\n\nPrev Page 8 of 11 Next Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Nokia 7600\n\nRelease date: 2003\n\nBack in the 2000s, Nokia was the king of phones. But it had a few real misses: meet the Nokia 7600.\n\nIt had a bizarre teardrop-shaped body that looks nice on paper. But in real life? It's madness. The Nokia 7600 was chunky as anything, and almost impossible to use. This was back in the days before touchscreen and the buttons were plastered on each side of the screen in two totally non-ergonomic straight columns.\n\nNot only did it look weird enough to earn you nothing but ridicule from friends, it was just about impossible to use for the first there weeks too. A stone cold classic. Not.\n\nPrev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Motorola StarTAC Rainbow\n\nRelease date: 1996\n\nStarTAC? Star of tacky, more like. Making phones anything but black has been a hard road for phone-makers over the years. There were the years of cringey pink mobiles, before companies like Nokia showed how it's done with their Lumia phones. And then there was the StarTAC Rainbow.\n\nThe Motorola StarTAC Rainbow was.... well. It was a bold effort. As if a rainbow vomited onto a boring old clamshell phone, its colours just don't fit with the rest of the design. And back in 1997 this wasn't all that cheap either. The original StarTAC cost $1000.\n\nIn fairness, the Motorola StarTAC Rainbow is remembered by some as a bit of a minor classic. But you don't half need some cojones to pull one off.\n\nPrev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Xcute DV1\n\nRelease date: 2005\n\nWe may have forgotten this, but in the 2000s we saw some incredibly innovative phone cameras. The Nokia N93 had an optical zoom. The Nokia N86 has variable aperture. Yep, Nokia was the king of phone cameras back then, and Samsung also made the first 8-megapixel phone.\n\nThese high-end cameras were packed into serious phones. But Xcute got the wrong end of the stick and crammed one into a clamshell phone called the Xcute DV1 back in 2006.\n\nIt looks like the sort of phone you'd pick up at Carphone Warehouse to send SMSs and play Snake on, but then there's that giant growth in its hinge. It looks like someone has sellotaped a bazooka onto the thing. Boy, this is a bad-looking phone.\n\nBut at least it's interesting.

I gasp as I learn that Microsoft this week secured a wearable patent: glasses that can detect the feelings of anyone in your field of vision.\n\nIt's entitled \"Wearable emotion detection and feedback system.\"\n\nIts abstract declares that this is \"a see-through, head mounted display and sensing devices cooperating with the display detect audible and visual behaviors of a subject in a field of view of the device.\"\n\nIt's a little like those things NBA players wear when they have pink eye. It's a lot more intrusive.\n\nThe idea is that you'll be able to tell when that big-toothed smiley salesman in front of you is, in fact, deeply angry. You'll be able to tell if the sullen-looking bartender you're talking to is, in fact, in love.\n\nYou'll have to wear them on every first date, so that you can be clear whether the person on the other side of the table really does think you're gorgeous or is just saying so. And just imagine how you'll be able to, finally, finally know what your spouse is truly feeling.\n\nYou can surely imagine the science behind this. In Microsoft's words: \"During interactions, the device, recognizes emotional states in subjects by comparing detected sensor input against a database of human/primate gestures/expressions, posture, and speech. Feedback is provided to the wearer after interpretation of the sensor input.\"\n\nYes, it's just like those non-verbal communication experts they always wheel out at election time, so that you can be informed whether Candidate X is nervous and evasive or whether he's so in love with himself that the world is, for him, a mere mirror of adoration.\n\nIt's adorable how the scientists behind this idea speak of humanity. For example: \"Emotions have an important influence in human lives, and can influence psychological and social behavior.\"\n\nWell, quite.

And, finally, came a photo of an unidentified small boy carrying a rifle.\n\nIt is not known when or where the photographs were taken.\n\nThey came to light during the testimony of defense witness Mark Spencer, a digital forensics expert from Arsenal Consultants.\n\nSpencer said the images were recovered from an encrypted file called \"Document\" on Tsarnaev's Samsung laptop after his death.\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over by his brother in the aftermath the deadly bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon.\n\nJUST WATCHEDHow did Tsarnaevs prepare for Boston bombing?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\n\nHow did Tsarnaevs prepare for Boston bombing? 01:43PLAY VIDEO\n\nThe defense expert delved into Tamerlan's computer files in much the same way federal prosecutors rooted through his younger brother's Sony laptop earlier in this trial.\n\nTamerlan the heavy, Jahar the pawn\n\nDzhokhar \"Jahar\" Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 counts relating to the bombings and their aftermath; 17 counts, involving the murders of three marathon spectators and an MIT police officer, carry the death penalty as a possible sentence.\n\nDefense attorneys are fighting to convince jurors to spare 21-year-old Jahar Tsarnaev from execution and instead sentence him to life in prison without parole. The defense strategy includes shifting the focus of the trial to Tamerlan's radical beliefs and the power he held over his younger brother. They are trying to make Tamerlan the heavy and Jahar his pawn.\n\nOne of the witnesses, a boxing coach who knew the brothers when they were younger, spoke the words that surely were music to the defense attorneys' ears. Asked to describe Jahar, John Curran said: \"I remember mentioning to somebody that he was like a puppy following his brother.\"\n\nThe subject of Tamerlan has dominated the testimony. Besides the computer expert and his former boxing coach, witnesses have included his music teacher, his mother-in-law, his wife's best friend, a handful of classmates and acquaintances and his landlady's son.\n\nThey spoke about how he pursued a career as an amateur boxer but was disappointed when his lack of U.S. citizenship stifled his progress. He went from hard-drinking, pot smoking drug dealer to clean-living, devout stay-at-home dad.\n\nWhile he once was a flashy dresser who left a plume of aftershave behind him and wore boots the color of aluminum foil, he began to walk the streets of Cambridge in the flowing robes of devout Muslims.\n\nAll the while, the defense says, he obsessively trolled the Internet in search of the messages of violent jihad.

Another friend refuses to testify and planned to invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination if he was forced to take the witness stand.\n\nReports of FBI interviews with the two men -- the missing Magomed Dalokov and reluctant Viskian Vakhabov -- were read into the court record on Tuesday. Dalokov went to a gym and boxed with the brothers on the Friday night before the bombings. Vakhabov told the FBI that Tamerlan Tsarnaev spoke often about his belief in violent jihad and believed it was \"the right way to go.\"\n\nThe defense had planned to introduce evidence that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was violent with his wife, Katherine Russell, but that avenue of questioning was cut off by a prosecutor's objection.\n\nThe trial record, as it stands, is as follows:\n\nKatherine Russell's best friend since childhood, Gina Crawford, is on the stand.

She called the FBI when she learned he was dead.\n\n\"At some point Ms. Russell thought for a moment that it could have been Tamerlan that bombed the Boston Marathon, and the reason she thought that was because he had become intensely radical in his views of Islam and politics, and she was aware that the FBI had interviewed him at some point,\" Clarke explained at yet another sidebar.\n\n\"So she had these immediate concerns, and then she pushed them out of her head because she thought how horrible could it be that she could have that thought about him, her own son-in-law.\"\n\nBoston bombing: The dead and injured 20 photosBoston bombing: The dead and injured 20 photosLingzi Lu, 23, was a graduate student from China, studying statistics.

Microsoft will also look at allowing apps from other platforms on its phones, said one source, opening the door to thousands of Apple iOS apps.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nThe strategy runs the risk of making Windows phones less attractive if they are merely seen as emulations of Android or Apple devices. But Microsoft may have no choice, according to analysts.\n\n\"Their approach recognizes that code for a mobile app can start from any of a number of sources,\" said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC. \"The only approach to succeed today is to recognize the multiple developer ecosystems out there.\"\n\nMicrosoft is expected to make the announcement at its developer conference in San Francisco later on Wednesday.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, currently has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market.

We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc.\n\n'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now.\n\n'This was not an easy decision, and I think it's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category.'\n\nAs the Apple Watch starts shipping to people who pre-ordered the timepiece, tech experts at iFixit have begun taking the gadget apart to see what's inside.\n\nIt is the first time many of the features of the Apple Watch have been confirmed, including the timepiece's battery.\n\nAccording to iFixit's so-called 'teardown' the battery inside is 205mAh - 14 times smaller than the battery of the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nWhen the battery life of the Apple Watch was announced, boss Tim Cook said it would last 'all-day'. But this is actually 18 hours with 'typical use.'\n\nOfficial tests found typical use equates to just 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music.\n\niFixit removed the battery inside the Sport model and found it is 3.8 V, 0.78 Wh lithium-ion battery running at 205mAh.\n\nIt is likely the higher end models and the 42mm versions of the Watch feature the same technology, but this hasn't been confirmed.\n\nBy comparison, the battery in the Moto 360 - which is around $100 (\u00a3100) cheaper than Apple's version - is slightly larger at 300mAh, as is the battery in the Samsung Gear Live.\n\nWhile the battery inside the iPhone 6 Plus is 2,915 mAh, more than 14 times larger than the battery in the watch.\n\nThe Moto 360 is said to last up to 24 hours, although with typical use this drops to almost half and the battery on Samsung's Gear Live manages to last longer - up to 48 hours but 16 hours with typical use.\n\nSoftware, apps and chips can directly impact the battery life of devices and this is why batteries of the same size can last for varying periods of time.\n\niFixit's teardown of the Apple Watch also reveals the Taptic Engine, the mechanism behind the clock, and a waterproof speaker.\n\nThe Taptic Engine is a linear actuator inside the Watch that produces haptic feedback. It is what is used to send heartbeats to friends, for example.\n\nIn less technical terms this taps the wearer on the wrist whenever they receive an alert or notification, or press down on the display.\n\nThis is combined with 'subtle audio cues' from the speaker driver.\n\nOn the back of the Watch's case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect the wearer's heart rate.\n\nApple Watch uses this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi\u2011Fi in a connected iPhone, to measure physical movement such as steps, distance and calories.\n\nThe chip in the Apple Watch is called S1 and it is said to be similar in power to the A5 that powered the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S.\n\nIt is called a System in Package (SiP) chip and Samsung reportedly supplied the RAM and flash storage. The S1 is covered in a resin shell designed to protect the chip from impact and water.\n\nIn terms of storage, Apple has confirmed all three models of the watch will ship with 8GB of total storage.\n\nThis will be used to run the Watch's iOS software and apps and at least 2GB of this will be free for music and photos.\n\nAlthough this is the equivalent to just 240 songs, it does mean the timepiece can be used independently for certain tasks. The number of tracks it can store will also vary depending on the file sizes.\n\nElsewhere, the Watch uses Apple's MagSafe technology with inductive charging. This is built on the underside of the watch base.\n\nThis means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector onto a charging port, where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically.\n\nMagSafe is the name of the connector Apple uses with its MacBook range.\n\nThe screen on the Watch has a laminated Retina display made from a 'single crystal of sapphire.' While on the Sport collection the screen has the added protection of Ion-X glass.\n\nThe 38 mm model has a resolution of 272 x 340 pixels (290 PPI), while the 42 mm model is 312 x 390 pixels (302 PPI).\n\nBy comparison, the iPhone 6 has a resolution of 1920x1080-pixel (401 PPI).\n\nAll models will be sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions depending on which colour the owner chooses.\n\nPrices for the Sport model start at $349 in the US and \u00a3299 in the UK, while the stainless steel Watch starts at $549 (\u00a3479).\n\nThis means US employees will only pay $174.50 and $274 respectively, while in the UK the price drops to \u00a3149.50 and \u00a3239.50.\n\nAndreas Pouros, co-founder at digital agency Greenlight told MailOnline: 'The Apple Watch may be shiny and new, but it's also completely unproven. There's no telling how consumers will use it or if it will even take off.\n\n'Building apps for it may pay off, but it's a massive gamble; and one that most marketers aren't willing to take.\n\n'By comparison, Google estimates that around 50 per cent of searches are conducted from mobile devices, through mobile browsers and its own search apps.\n\n'With so much at risk, even marketers who have already developed a mobile website would be better off putting their money into improving the user experience and targeting mobile users than building a smart watch app that could be dead in the water within months.'\n\nApple's smartwatch officially went on sale today, but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock.\n\nInstead, consumers have to pre-order the watches online or go to select partner shops and boutiques to buy the Watch today.\n\nUsually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores.\n\nBut analysts believe the company feared the queues might be 'embarrassingly small' and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang.\n\nIn fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations.\n\nAs a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today.\n\nAnalysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year.\n\nStephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, told MailOnline: 'It was rather sad not to see all those technophiles camping outside Apple Stores this week.\n\n'I doubt this new sales strategy will do much harm to sales of the Watch, as Apple has incredible brand loyalty, but neither should it underestimate the impact those queues had. They are the most photographed and talked about queues in the world and I can think of no other brand gets that kind of exposure for a product launch."], "2015-04-30": ["A question that I've received over 50 times so far is \"is the Samsung Galaxy S camera really that good?\" Well, I've been using this guy right here, the Galaxy S6 Edge and the Galaxy S6 as my daily driver for about a week and a half now and I've been doing a little bit of traveling, I've been using this phone on a daily basis. so that means, I have taken quite a few videos and photos and this is sort of my Samsung Galaxy S6 Camera Review and an overall perspective on why I think this is the best camera in the mobile industry.\n\nSo first of all, let's go ahead and talk about the hardware of this camera here. It's pretty much a very simple thing. It's a 16MP camera sensor over a 1/2.3-inch sensor. It also has Optical Image Stabilization and it has a lot of good software to make your videos and photos look very beautiful.\n\nOver the past couple generations of Galaxy S, devices have taken huge strides in making the camera almost near perfection and in my opinion, the Galaxy S6 is really the best camera around. In my opinion, better than the iPhone 6. I'm not sure if I'm going to rate it as much as a Lumia 1020 but that's really out there in terms of the megapixel war.\n\nFirst of all, let's dive into the photos because that's usually how I go into these reviews. First of all, dynamic range is really on point. HDR works beautifully. Really good dynamic photos here like a New York skyscraper. We're looking at really beautiful looking blue skies, a nice building. Colors and exposure are all in perfect harmony. And also photos like in nature, like in parks and stuff, the photos just look really beautiful. The detail from the 16MP photo look really good. The leaves are very green, the cells you can almost see the cells of the leaves. It just looks really, really crisp.\n\nOne thing that I've noticed while using the Galaxy S6 is really how fast autofocus is. It is really crazy fast. Autofocus is like a sniper rifle, we're talking about super-fast autofocus. It works really well and you'll see how that also works in video because while we're doing 4K video, the focus is unbelievably good.\n\nEven zooming in and popping into any of these photos, you really don't lose so much detail. You're only going to start seeing details and artifacts when you really go again like 400-500%. But when do you ever do that on your desktop computer, most of all your photos are going to be on Instagram, Facebook and maybe on other types of media sharing websites. But other than that, you're really not going to blow up any of these photos and print them. You probably could, it would probably look really good because the photos just look that good.\n\nMoving in to the video side of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, is 4K UHD video an OIS? First of all, the 4K video is unbelievably good. It records unbelievably good and rich video. I mean, everything, the smooth the colors are great. You're basically getting the same dynamic range as you are getting when you're using HDR mode on the photos side of the Galaxy S6 and that just looks really stunning. I actually used the Galaxy S6 as a standalone 4K camera on some of my shoots with Danny Winget a couple of days ago and the video just looks very good.\n\nOIS also works very good. If you have really shaky hands or if you're walking or something, you'll probably see the little kind of stabilization effects on the edges of the video but overall, it does a very good job at stabilizing shaky hands while you're walking or really, it just does a good job in making your video look that much better.\n\nIn general, 4K video on any type of video recording on the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge is just really fun to do. You have tons of options on the camera, you have tons of things you can do when video recording. You can do slow motion video, you can do 4K UHD video if you want to. You can really do a whole lot of stuff off this camera.\n\nThe only gripe I still have on the Galaxy S6 is the camera application is still a little rather confusing but it definitely is improving the software and hopefully the next generation of TouchWiz will see a very good and intuitive software in the camera department.\n\nSo my overall impression on the Galaxy S6 and really the camera is how flipping good the camera is. It's super crisp, super detailed. It is literally the best camera on a mobile phone I've ever used. Better than the iPhone 6, better than any phone I've actually used in all of my time of being a phone reviewer. It's just really, really good. I'm happy that Samsung has nailed this camera and I'm really looking forward to how the heck they're going to improve this camera in the next iteration. You have the Note 5 coming up in September, the Galaxy S7 next year. It's definitely going to be interesting to see how Samsung can really improve this. We're probably going to talk about 6K video recording, right type of quality on the next Galaxy S7, which would be pretty epic.\n\nSo I want to hear what you guys think about the Galaxy S6 camera. You saw all of my staples during this video, you've probably looked at samples online from different reviewers. I want to hear what your thoughts are on the Galaxy S6 and its camera primarily.

There's even an Internet-enabled Barbie doll in the works that can \"talk\" with a child.\n\nWithout proper safeguards, \"all of the data that different devices and sites have collected about you can be combined, then exploited by marketers or stolen by hackers,\" the magazine said.\n\nBedoya said his center combed through numerous devices' privacy policies and found that in general, they were written to protect manufacturers rather than consumers. Specifically, Bedoya said, he read through policies from makers of smart TVs, Nest home thermostats and some glucose monitors.\n\n\"Most of what they give you are disclaimers -- 'We reserve the right to do this, we reserve the right to do that,'\" he said.\n\nBut he also said that there are no federal privacy laws and few state laws governing the use of data obtained by smart devices. \"There's no pressure on these companies to make these privacy policies anything other than a set of disclaimers. The laws encourage them to be vague.\"\n\nBedoya said the Assembly bill, by Mike Gatto, D-Los Angeles, would ask device manufactures to \"get your consent before they collect the data,\" which would be \"what consumers care about.\"\n\nStill, Bedoya said, consumers should protect themselves by reading through the fine print and calling \"the companies out when they see them doing something they don't think is right.\"\n\nSamsung rewrote\n\n\"Consumers may not have legal rights that are as clear as we would wish them to be, but they can use the power of the people,\" Bedoya said. \"If you have a Facebook profile or a Twitter profile, you should use that as a podium.\"\n\nConsumer Reports also recommended using passwords on devices and related Internet accounts, and learning how to find the \"off\" setting on certain tracking features. People should also never leave connected devices on while not in use. And if the Internet-connected device doesn't offer a \"tangible benefit to you, buy the non-connected version.\"", "If you use these words and phrases your mum and dad will be very confused\n\nThe English language is evolving at a faster rate now than at any other time in history because of social media and instant messaging, a language expert has said.\n\nProfessor John Sutherland from University College London is the UK's leading English expert, and has led a study into common social media and \"text speak\" terms that found most parents were baffled by the language used by their children.\n\nAccording to the study, which was commissioned by technology giant Samsung to mark the launch of the Galaxy S6, there was now a \"seismic generational gap\" between the older and younger generations when it came to how modern informal language was used.\n\nModern terms such as \"fleek\" and \"bae\" were found to be the most commonly confused by parents, with just 10% of the 2,000 surveyed being able to identify the true meaning of \"bae\" -

Could this finally be the death of the traditional camera? Probably not, but enjoy seeing improvements in smartphone photography.\n\nThe camera will load in just 0.6 seconds, so you'll only have yourself to blame if you miss a shot. There's also a dedicated rear key to make it easier to open and snap immediately.\n\nThe LG G4's camera comes with a f1.8 lens and a larger 16 megapixel image sensor, making it one of the best in the business. The lens allows 80 percent more light to hit the image sensor than in the LG G3. LG seems confident in its ability to take excellent pictures in low-light settings.\n\nSelfie fans will be pleased to hear that there's an 8 megapixel sensor on the front of the G4. Not only that, but it seems destined to be used with selfie sticks thanks to the gesture recognition, which can be used to take a picture.\n\nLG took plenty of opportunities to knock Samsung's most recent efforts. The camera opens faster, the G4 comes with microSD support, and you can remove the battery. There were plenty of shots fired during the press conference.\n\nElsewhere, there were fewer surprises thanks to the number of leaks ahead of the announcement. The G4 will utilise a six-core Snapdragon 808 processor rather than the 810 chip used in many phones this year. It will run Android Lollipop with some custom tweaks.\n\nLG did not reveal when the handset will be released. It will be available with a leather back, or a ceramic plastic with a metallic finish.

Mobile phone manufacturers then spent years trying to pack in as much as they could into smaller and smaller mobile handsets. Yet as soon as this was perfected, we were introduced to the tablet - designed to make use of the users growing entertainment and browsing needs.\n\nBut now, just a few years on, it seems that mobile handsets are getting bigger and even tablets are starting to drop in size, like the iPad mini. So, are consumers ultimately looking for the perfect sized device that can do all the things they need it to on a daily basis yet still be a conveniently sized in order to carry around? And if so, surely it's a great gap in the market fit for the phablet.\n\nThe unfortunately nicknamed phablet merges together qualities of both a smartphone and a tablet, and dimension-wise, the screen itself is typically sized somewhere in between 5 and 7 inches. Even though on the face of things it may just seem like the phablet is simply a quickly tacked together hybrid put out there to appease both consumer markets, but now even smartphones are reaching the dizzying heights of 5+ inch sized screens. So what makes the likes of the iPhone Plus 6 or the Samsung Galaxy S6 want to head into phablet territory?\n\nIf we head all the way back to 1993 you may just about recall the AT&T EO 440 Personal Communicator. It has been described as the first true phablet, and this multitasking dinosaur did actually provide a combination of both phone, and what we now consider to be tablet-related, functionality. It was about the size of a small clipboard, and thanks to the wireless cellular network modem and built in microphone that it included, it also allowed you to make calls, fax and even email.\n\nThe EO 440 didn't exactly set the world alight and with the internet and the World Wide Web slowly snowballing through the 1990's it wouldn't be long before other technologies around us would soon help pave the way to new and innovative devices that could interact with these world changing technological advances.\n\nWhile the mobile phone was fast evolving itself in to the smartphone, at a time when the Internet had truly become a global phenomenon and when wireless networking technology had already begun to offer freedom and flexibility for many different industries, it did seem that the mid-naughties had so much more to offer creative developers and designers. Suddenly we leap forward to 2007 and are once more introduced to the coming together of phone and tablet technology but with something that had a lot more to offer than that of AT&T's effort in the early 90's.\n\nThe fresh-faced HTC Advantage X7500 was unleashed which was set to pave the way for future 'phablet'-esque devices to hit the market. It featured a magnetically attached keyboard, WiFi, Bluetooth, a USB 2.0 port, SIM and miniSDHC slots. It certainly piqued the interest of many consumers looking for something more than just a phone but something more portable and lightweight than laptops that were on offer at the time. The phablets biggest drawback came with its staggering price tag which certainly pushed many potential customers elsewhere.\n\nThere were plenty of less successful monikers soon after the Advantage such as the Nokia N810 WiMAX, the home based Verizon Hub, and the extremely bug-infested Dell Streak. It wasn't until 2012 when it looked like Samsung had finally constructed the best of both worlds with its memorable release of the Samsung Galaxy Note.\n\nThe new and shiny Android-based device was met with much praise from critics and consumers alike, which was apparent when it managed to sell over one million units in just the first two months of release. It went on to sell over 10 million units worldwide and has since been followed up with numerous new and improved editions being released each and every year since. The original Galaxy Note came with a crisp 1280 x 800 5.3 inch screen, a powerful 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, and utilized an S Pen stylus.\n\nIt's even more incredible to think that the Galaxy Note was actually criticized by some non-believers when it first arrived. Many believed that the device was actually laughable when it was being used as an actual phone. Its 5.3 inch screen was the main cause of concern, a great size for working on but how could holding such an oversized handset be comfortable or respectable? I mean this wasn't the early 90's anymore! But it had more than limited appeal and people responded positivity to the screen increase. Had the market changed, did we want more phone, phablet, or tablet for our money?\n\nFast track to today and there is at least one phablet from every major smartphone manufacturer, even some from companies less known to consumers in larger markets like the U.S., like Huawei's Ascend Mate 7. The Mate 7 is a great display at how far the design of phablets have come with a sleek metal body, but it also showcases that phablets are a device category that is popular with consumers the world over. Samsung has popularized the phablet category with their successful 'Galaxy Note' series of devices, which is now currently in its 4th iteration with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Note Edge, both offering Samsung's best technology in a phablet device to date with improved S-Pen functionality, a better screen and improved camera. It's also sporting the biggest display of any Note device so far. Bigger still is the Samsung Galaxy Mega, which is an absolutely massive device. It harbors on the edge of being perhaps slightly too large coming in at 6.3-inches, but nevertheless there was still a market for people who had a need for a screen of that size.\n\nWhile Samsung's phablet devices are easily the front runners (at least the Galaxy Note series), others have stepped up to grab hold of a piece of the market in what is now clearly a more acceptable size for a smartphone. LG responded to Samsung's Galaxy Note and Galaxy Mega with their own LG Vu, putting their own spin on a phablet with a more oddball aspect ratio. Dell and HTC also entered into the mix with the Dell Streak and HTC One Max devices, providing consumers and loyal fans of their respective brands with an option for a smartphone with a larger screen size. Google and Motorola have partnered together for 2014's Nexus device with the Nexus 6, sporting one of the biggest displays on a more well-known smartphone. This is of course after Sony had released its Xperia Z Ultra much earlier, which not only came in its original form with the stock Sony UI but was also granted (for a time) a spot in the Google Play Store's 'Devices' section as one of the Google Play Edition smartphones, sporting a 6-inch display with Sony hardware and the loveable stock Android experience of a Nexus.\n\nHas the market changed, do we want more phone, phablet, or tablet for our money? Most definitely their is a market for large screen smartphones, in fact whole ranges of them you can pick up at The Smart Phone Company, and it doesn't look like users these days mind whatsoever about resting their cheek and ear up against these hefty new devices to keep in touch with family and friends.", "At BUILD 2015 the company unveiled its plans to begin incorporating new security features and password protection methods into the final build of Windows 10.\n\nThe first inclusion in the lineup is one you might already recognize: biometric fingerprint scanning. This option is certainly nothing new, and has been supported in Windows going back as early as XP and 2000. Some laptops already come with the option to use your fingerprint alongside your password for user verification, and Microsoft says we should expect Windows 10 to be fully compatible with older readers as well as newer Windows phones with a built-in fingerprint scanner of their own.\n\nRelated: Your Windows 10 phone might be the only PC you'll ever need\n\nNext will be a feature you've probably already seen on devices like the Samsung Galaxy: facial recognition using the onboard camera. In order to get past your password prompt, the camera will take a reading of the user's face, using specialized software to scan their features and grant access even if they're wearing new glasses, have a different hairstyle, or grew a swirly mustache.\n\nBut just in case both your face and your fingerprint aren't enough verification, users will also have the option to include an iris scan in the credential key-chain. Though there aren't any devices on shelves with compatible hardware just yet, Microsoft says we can expect to see iris scanning laptops and peripherals for desktops start to roll out sometime in the next 12 months.\n\nLast is Microsoft Passport, a password service which will ask users to create unique PINs to tie to their Microsoft Live account, instead of a pair of alphanumerical credentials that might be easily guessed by friends or family members who happen to know the name of your first pet.\n\nRelated: Microsoft wants you to use its Windows Store for apps, makes a ton of changes\n\nThe PIN will do everything from logging you into your desktop to making it quick and easy to make purchases on the Windows Store, as well as using any Azure Active Directory or OneDrive cloud services.\n\nIf you want to use Windows Hello, though, you must choose one of these new security methods. It will not work for users who stick with an old-fashioned password.", "The English language is evolving faster than ever -- leaving older Brits literally lost for words, research has revealed.\n\nA detailed study has identified the social media language and mobile messaging terms that perplex millions of parents and which point to a future where emoticons mayreplace the written word.\n\nBeing 'on fleek', meaning 'looking perfect' is a popular term young kids are using that parents don't understand, as is 'bae' short for baby or meaning 'Before Anyone Else'.\n\nThe phrase, often championed by the likes of Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, left 90 per cent of parents in the dark.\n\nAnd 'fear of missing out' - commonly abbreviated to 'FOMO' - also leaves parents scratching their heads.\n\nThe study was led by the English language expert Professor John Sutherland wascommissioned to mark the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S6 phone.\n\nThe results point to a seismic generational gap in how we use and understand modern informal text speak while also suggesting older style abbreviations and acronyms such as TXT are now so old they are considered antiquated by the younger generation.\n\nThe poll found that 86 per cent of all British parents think teenagers speak an entirely different language on social media and mobile messaging.\n\nThe top 10 also featured the popular Instagram term TBT (Throw Back Thursday), used for posting old images on the social media network, alongside the phrase 'Thirsty' used to describe people who are looking for attention.\n\nThe study also reveals the top ten now outdated text, social media and instant messaging which the under 16 generation would now consider outdated.\n\nThe poll found that 80 per cent of British parents believe that text speak has changed over time with a few terms such as LOL and OMG crossing generations to stand the test of time.\n\nJohn Sutherland, Lord Northcliffe Professor Emeritus of Modern English Literature at University College London, said: \"The Samsung Galaxy S6 Evolution of Text study provides us with a fascinating overview of how our informal language has evolved over the last 25 years and points to a future where we will see pictorial messaging in the ascendant.\n\n\"The limitation of characters on old handsets were a key factor in the rise of acronyms in text messaging such as TXT, GR8 and M8.\n\n\"However, technological evolution has meant that these words are now effectively extinct from the text speak language and are seen as 'antique text speak'.\n\n\"Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S6 give people a much a wider range of communication options which means we are no longer restricted to a limited numbers of characters.\n\n\"The use of audio and visual messaging has become more commonplace with the soaring popularity of social media and instant messaging apps such as Instagram, Vine and Snapchat.\n\n\"In fact we are moving to a more pictographic form of communication with the increasing popularity of emoticons.

The LS27D590CS-ZA ($399.99) reviewed here is a 27-inch display that uses a Vertical Alignment (VA) panel to deliver good color and gray-scale performance, with inky blacks and wide viewing angles. Although its curved panel gets you closer to the action while gaming and watching movies, this monitor maxes out at 1080p and lacks certain features, like USB ports and a height-adjustable stand. For around $50 more, our top pick for midrange big-screen monitors, the Acer K272HUL, offers a higher resolution and more video inputs.\n\nDesign and Features\n\nThe LS27D590C's half-inch, glossy-black bezels, curved cabinet and stand, and brushed aluminum trim offer a sleek, minimalist design. The cabinet measures 24.54 by 14.40 by 2.34 inches (HWD). The T-shaped stand has a slight curve that matches the curve of the panel, but doesn't have height, swivel, and pivot adjustments. However, it does let you tilt the panel 20 degrees backward and 2 degrees forward. The monitor has two embedded 5-watt speakers that are relatively loud and can be cranked up without distorting, but they don't offer much bass response.\n\nAs with the Samsung LS27D590PS, there aren't any function buttons on the front of this monitor. Instead, the settings menus are accessed and navigated using a jog button on the rear of the cabinet on the lower-right side. The button, which also acts as a Power switch, is much easier to use than the traditional multi-button configuration used on most monitors. Also at the rear of the cabinet are HDMI, VGA, and DisplayPort video inputs, an audio input, and a headphone jack. Like the Acer K272HUL, the LS27D590C doesn't have any USB ports.\n\nPicture settings include Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Image Size (Aspect Ratio), and four presets (Standard, Cinema, Dynamic Contrast, and Custom). There's also a Game Mode that is much brighter than the other presets and produces oversaturated colors. There are individual sliders for adjusting red, green, and blue saturation levels and five Color Temperature settings, but you don't get the advanced 6-Axis Color settings that you do with the Acer H257HU. Samsung backs the LS27D590C with a one-year warranty on parts, labor, and backlight. Included in the box are HDMI and audio cables and a Quick Setup Guide.\n\nPerformance\n\nAs shown on the chromaticity chart below, the LS27D590C delivers mostly accurate colors. The colored dots represent the panel's measured color coordinates, and the boxes represent the ideal color coordinates as described by the International Committee On Illumination (CIE). As you can see, red and blue colors are closely aligned with their ideal coordinates, while green is slightly skewed. Fortunately, this flaw is minor and doesn't result in tinting or oversaturated colors.\n\nThe LS27D590C's VA panel was able to display each shade of gray on the DisplayMate 64-Step Gray-Scale test, but it can't match the intensity and sharpness of a high-end In-Plane Switching (IPS) panel such as the one used on the NEC MultiSync EA244UHD. That said, the monitor produced very dark blacks and provided good shadow and highlight detail while displaying my test images and while displaying scenes from Marvel's Ironman 3 on Blu-ray. As with the LG 34UC97-S and the Dell UltraSharp U3415W, the LS27D590C's curved screen gives you a feeling of immersion; it's a subtle effect but it makes gaming and watching movies a bit more pleasurable.\n\nSpeaking of gaming, the panel's 4-millisecond (gray-to-gray) pixel response kept ghosting to a minimum while I played Crysis 3 on a PC and Call of Duty: Black Ops on the Microsoft XBox 360 console. Its 11.8-millisecond input lag (the time it takes to react to a controller command, as measured by the Leo Bodnar Video Signal Lag Tester) isn't quite as fast as the BenQ XL2430T (9.5 milliseconds), but it's still pretty fast, and I did not notice any lag whatsoever.", "Since it introduced the first Galaxy S phone in 2010, Samsung has ruled the high-end Android phone market. But two years ago, the situation started to change. Other phone companies like LG and HTC caught up to Samsung.\n\nLast year, however, the situation became drastic for Samsung as Apple came out with an iPhone with a large screen. The Galaxy S6 (and the Galaxy S6 Edge) is Samsung's answer to the mighty iPhone. And it is a damn good answer.\n\nJust as Apple moved out of its comfort zone and decided to put a bigger screen in the iPhone to make it remarkably good, with Galaxy S6, Samsung has moved away from using plastic bodies for its phone.\n\nWhile it looks good, the design of the S6 is still not all that original. The rounded corners of the metal frame and the speaker grill seem to be inspired by the design of the iPhone 6.\n\nBut the overall effect is pleasing to the eye. The glass back cover and the metal alloy frame make for a nice combination, although the phone is a little slippery to hold.\n\nThe phone is very slim with a thickness of just 6.9mm, and is astoundingly light at 138 grams despite packing in a 5.1-inch screen. This makes carrying it in the hand or putting it in one's pocket very easy, which is a welcome change compared to much bigger phones in the market like the Moto X.\n\nWhat makes the S6 really good is its core hardware. The screen has a resolution of 1440 X 2560 pixels, making it extremely sharp. This means text and images look super sharp and clear on the screen of the S6. The screen is also extremely bright and shows vivid colours.\n\nOther components are equally good. The octa-core processor in the phone is fast. Unlike many other phones that use Qualcomm processors, the new Galaxy is using Samsung's own Exynos chip.\n\nWhether a user is playing a demanding game or editing a photo with Instagram, the phone doesn't feel slow.\n\nIt also helps that the phone has 3GB RAM and according to Samsung, a rather fast 32GB internal speed.\n\nThe 16-megapixel camera is one of the best ever put in a phone. It is so good that for the first time an Android phone rivals the camera performance of an iPhone 6. It clicks extremely detailed photos with excellent colours in good light. Even in low light the performance is very good due to the wide aperture (F1.9) of the camera.\n\nThe 5-megapixel front camera is also one of the best in its class, and comes with an ultrawide lens so that a user can fit more people into group selfies.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 has a number of unique features. It comes with a fingerprint sensor, which can be used to lock or unlock the phone. Unlike the scanner in the Galaxy S5, this one works in a much better way. Then, there is the heart rate sensor at the back. This is hit-and-miss, so it's more of a gimmick.\n\nThe phone is powered by Android Lollipop. But Samsung has customised it with its own user interface called Touchwiz. This is the only weak point of the Galaxy S6. While TouchWiz and Android are versatile and full of unique features, the iOS that powers the iPhone or even Sense, which is inside HTC phones, is more streamlined.\n\nBattery life is also could have been better. The phone lasts around 12 to 13 hours - good enough for a single day of use - but falls short of what some other Android phones can manage.\n\nBut overall, the S6 is one hell of a phone. With it, Samsung has finally created a phone that can not only match but in some cases surpasses the iPhone 6. The fact that it does so at a price of Rs 49,900, lower than the price of the iPhone 6, is even more impressive.\n\nMisplaced your phone? Do a Google search\n\nIf you have an Android phone and if you can't remember where you put it just moments ago, whether on the dining table or under a pillow on the sofa, stop the frantic search. Instead, do a Google search for it.\n\nLast week Google came out with a feature that helps you locate your misplaced or lost phone. To locate your phone, all you have to do is put \"Find my phone\" in the Google search. The website then looks for the location of your phone and then displays it in a map.\n\nOn the same web page, you also get an option to \"ring\" your phone. Once you click on that, your phone will ring for five minutes at full volume so that you can locate the sound and find it. The phone rings even if it is the silent mode.\n\nNow of course, there are a certain requirements for this feature. First of all, you can find your phone only if you are logged into Google using the same email/Google ID that you use on your phone. It also requires that your phone has the location services on, has the latest version of the Google services installed, and has the Android 4 or newer version running on it.\n\nOn your phone, you can turn on the location services from settings. Additionally, from the same settings you can also check the version of the Android that your phone has.", "HELSINKI (AP) -- Buoyed by strong overall sales, Nokia made a net profit of 177 million euros ($195 million) in the first quarter from a loss a year earlier, but its shares plummeted more than 10 percent Thursday over a weak performance at its main networks unit.\n\nDespite a rise in sales in all its operations for the third quarter in a row, Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri described the networks division's profits -- which fell 60 percent -- as \"unsatisfactory,\" saying the company was hurt by increased competition and \"strategic entry deals, particularly in China.\"\n\nInvestors were disappointed and Nokia's stock fell nearly 11 percent to close at 6.04 euros on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.\n\nAnalyst Hannu Rauhala from Pohjola Bank described Nokia's networks profit as \"a clear disappointment.\"\n\nDespite the drop in networks profit, the Finnish company's overall revenue surged 20 percent in the period, to 3.2 billion euros from 2.6 billion euros a year earlier and it swung into profit from a net loss of 239 million euros a year earlier.\n\nThe former top mobile phone maker, which peaked in 2008 with a global market share of 40 percent, failed to meet the smartphone challenge of the iPhone, Samsung and cheaper competitors in Asia. But its fortunes changed when it sold the ailing cellphone unit to Microsoft last year and started showing growth in the three remaining operations -- networks, mapping services and technologies.\n\nEarlier this month, Nokia announced a major deal to acquire French networks company, Alcatel-Lucent, which could make it the leading global networks provider. Suri described it as a \"good deal\" with benefits to shareholders.\n\n\"We are moving fast on the necessary integration planning, and have already established a structure designed to minimize disruption to our ongoing business,\" he said.\n\nNokia says it expects savings of 900 million euros by 2019 when the two companies join, with 200 million euros reductions in interest expenses per year by 2017.\n\nSuri added that he was optimistic about the rest of the year, especially on deals with new customers.\n\n\"I see the impact of strategic entry deals to ease in the second half (because) most of the costs of these new deals you take up-front,\" Suri said. \"The momentum in some regions (will) overall improve for us.\"\n\nNeil Mawston of Strategy Analytics near London said Nokia might have bitten off more than it can chew with the 15 billion-euro acquisition.\n\n\"It's a big deal and not necessarily always easy to pull together,\" Mawston said. \"Nokia is obviously quite an experienced company but it's been through the wringer during the past few years and needs a period of stabilization before going on acquisition sprees.\"\n\nNokia's technologies section doubled sales to 193 million in the quarter, while HERE mapping services grew 25 percent to 261 million euros. Networks, which accounts for more than 80 percent of revenue, grew 15 percent to 2.6 billion euros. The company said it expects growth to continue in all three sectors.", "A report from a couple of days ago revealed that both the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge were having some RAM management problems which is odd especially when you consider the phone has an abundance of it. However the issue was the Samsung's software was too aggressive in managing the RAM, going as far as shutting them down automatically even when the user just wants them to run in the background.\n\nThe good news is that Samsung Mobile UK appears to have acknowledged the problem and has posted on its Facebook page that they are working on a series of micro-updates to the handset that will supposedly help deal with the problem. According to the Samsung Mobile UK's social media rep, \"Micro-updates are in the process of being rolled out to correct issues relating to device performance and stability Johan!, Keep checking for these on your device via Settings>About device>Software update>Update now.\"\n\nIt is unclear if these micro-updates will address the problem, but basically what it needs to do is stop being so aggressive in managing the RAM of the handset. We get what Samsung is trying to do but perhaps they're a tad overzealous in the process, either that or the feature isn't configured well to understand which app needs shutting down and which don't. In the meantime have any Galaxy S6/S6 Edge owners received an update that addresses the problem?", "Both Samsung and LG have launched their brand new flagship devices, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the LG G4, respectively. Both devices have received solid reviews and buyers are having a difficult time choosing between the two. We compare the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the LG G4 to see how they stack up against each other in terms of design, display, specs, performance and price.\n\nDimensions: The Samsung Galaxy S6 measures 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8mm and weighs 138g, while the LG G4 is larger and heavier at 148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8mm and weighing 155g.\n\nDesign: The Samsung S6 has a screen set in a magnesium-alloy frame and a toughened glass backside, with black, blue, white, gold and green options. The LG G4 comes with eight different leather backings, as well as two polymer (plastic) ones that lend it a premium look.\n\nDisplay: The Samsung Galaxy S6 features a 5.1-inch Quad HD display, 577ppi with a Super AMOLED panel, while the LG G4 sports a 5.5-inch Quad HD IPS \"Quantum Display\" (2,560 x 1,440), which LG claims improves color by 20 percent, brightness by 25 percent, contrast by 50 percent, and is 50 percent brighter than those of its competitors.\n\nSpecs: The Galaxy S6 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 64-bit Octa Core (Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57), ensuring a power-packed performance. LG has avoided using the Snapdragon 810 system in the G4, as Qualcomm has not yet addressed the overheating issue of the SoC model, and instead runs on a Snapdragon 64-bit hexacore 808 processor clocked at 1.8GHz.\n\nStorage: The LG G4 comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can be increased up to 128GB via a microSD card slot, while the Galaxy S6 comes in fixed 32GB, 64GB or 128GB models with no-microSD slots in either of the variants.\n\nFollow us\n\nBattery: The Galaxy S6 has a non-removable 2,550 mAh battery, with a 10-minute charge providing four hours of battery life, while the LG G4 comes with a 3000 mAh removable battery pack.\n\nCamera: LG's new phone has a 16-megapixel rear camera with f/1.8 aperture, laser auto focus, and optical image stabilization 2.0., resulting in higher resolution shots which capture 80-percent more light. The LG G4 also sports a front-facing 8MP camera with improved gesture shot for better selfies. The Galaxy S6 sports a rear 16-megapixel and a front 5-megapixel camera, along with a newly overhauled camera app.\n\nOperating system: The Galaxy S6 runs Google's Android Lollipop 5.0.2, while the LG G4 runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with LG's UX 4.0 on top on it.\n\nPrice: The 32GB Galaxy S6 model costs $199.99 on contract and the 64GB model costs $299.99 on contract, or $399.99 for the 128GB version. The Galaxy S6 is also available off-contract for around $684.99, or $999 for a factory unlocked version. LG is yet to announce the pricing for the G4, but will be targeting the Samsung Galaxy S6, as the company sees the vegetable-tanned leather back as a luxury offering and believes that consumers won't mind paying a premium for it.", "After posting our lengthy Samsung Galaxy S6 review a few weeks back, it behooved us to do something similar for its sibling, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. Sure, we briefly talked about some of the new Edge features already in our S6 review, but we felt like going more in depth with these new Galaxy S6 Edge features in a review all of their own.\n\nOn the hardware front, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are near identical for the most part, sporting nearly the exact same internals as one another (with the exception of a very small 50mAh increase in battery capacity for the S6 Edge). It's this reason for our review, we'll be focusing on the one feature that sets the two apart: the $100 extra curved Edge display.\n\nIt's the single defining feature of the Galaxy S6 and most can agree it improves upon the traditional boring \"flat\" smartphone design with something that looks like it stepped out of science fiction. The fact that the phone can often times be found appearing solo in Samsung Galaxy S6 marketing materials has us feeling like this is the Galaxy S6 Samsung wanted to make, but simply couldn't due to constraints surrounding production of its curved AMOLED display. Without a doubt the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge looks fresh, leaving Samsung with a product to finally set itself apart in a crowded market. In other words, they done did good.\n\nSamsung would love for you to believe that the S6's \"Edge display\" brings some kind of added functionality to the phone by displaying UI elements not normally viewable (or difficult to see) on a regular flat screen. Truth is, you could probably view the exact same information on a flat display when viewing the phone at a downward angle.\n\nWhen looking at the phone directly from its side (if you're laying in bed and viewing on your nightstand for instance), information from the Edge screen features are actually cut in half where they sit a lot higher than the actual edge of the display. How's that for irony?\n\nBefore we got our hands on it, we were honestly expecting something much more extreme and/or closer to what we saw with the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. Upon closer inspection, the Edge display is actually much more discrete than it appears in promos and it's probably better off. If the curve was angled any more than it already is, it would make full-screen viewing an extremely awkward experience.\n\nThat's not to say the curved display doesn't take some getting used to. Viewing web pages, videos, or images online feel strange at first, with your eyes focusing only on the flat portion of the display, discounting anything wrapping over to the curve portion. Aside from the image becoming warped and colors looking off, the curved edges also pick up a fair amount of glare, making full-screen viewing a bit more difficult than usual.\n\nWe'll admit, it's only really a problem when using the phone outside or when the display is dimly lit. Turn up the brightness indoors, and you shouldn't have much of a problem, if at all. It was bothersome enough for us to want to run back to our boring, basic, flat S6 unit. In the end, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge isn't necessarily going to turn any heads and anyone that doesn't know much about technology likely wont be impressed by this hardware feat.\n\nApart from its handsome good looks, the Edge doesn't really offer up any real-world benefit. In fact, the curved display actually makes for a smartphone that's both more difficult to view and awkward to hold. This is all thanks to the same metal frame from the Galaxy S6, only on the Edge, it shrinks down around the sides of the device. This allows that curved edge to extend halfway down its sides.\n\nThe problem is with such little surface area to grab onto, you never quite feel like you have a confident grip of the S6 Edge. Doesn't help matters that the metal frame also feels like non-stick Teflon.\n\nNeedless to say, unless you're comfortable with your phone flipping and flopping out of your hands and onto pavement -- you're going to want to invest in some protection. Using a case largely remedies this lack of grip issue , but you may find the selection of cases for the S6 Edge is much more limited than say, the regular S6 model (we listed some of our favorites right here).\n\nAnd although it may sound weird to say, using a case was probably our favorite part about the S6 Edge. Because the frame is so far along the sides of the phone, equipping a case -- even those bulky rugged ones -- never impedes on the edge itself. This allows your finger to reach and slide over the edges of the curved display without the usual thick rim of a case getting in the way. We absolutely loved that.\n\nSpeaking of sliding our fingers over the edge of the display, grabbing UI elements -- like slide-out navigation menus -- feels a hundred times more enjoyable than your usual flat device. We did notice a sort of dead zone along the sides (as well as slightly thicker black bezels), more than likely there to compensate for fingers that may slightly encroach on the Edge display when holding the device. We should also note there were more unintentional screen presses along the edges when viewing full screen media and/or playing video games. It was more than frustrating.\n\nWe should note, tempered glass screen protectors (the only kind we use on our phones these days) present a very real challenge for the Galaxy S6 Edge as the vast majority available only cover the middle flat portion of the display -- not the curved edges. There are very few tempered glass screen protectors available for the S6 Edge (we did find this one from Amzer), but expect to pay a higher premium than usual. This means plastic film screen protectors are generally going to be your best bet for now, but at least they're inexpensive.\n\nUltimately, the way that 3D-ish display felt when gliding our fingers across was easily the best feature of the S6 Edge and something that made transitioning back to flat phones feel.... well, a little boring to us. But as we mentioned, a nice case is all but mandatory for this version of the S6. Thankfully, we listed some of our favorites in a previous post right here.\n\nEven if the Galaxy S6 Edge doesn't bring any real world functionality in and of itself, the phone is bundled with a handful of exclusive software features to help take \"advantage\" of its curved display. Sure these features could have come bundled on the Galaxy S6 and worked just as well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nIn this portion of the review, we're going to examine Samsung's new \"Edge screen\" features for the Galaxy S6 Edge and evaluate whether or not they are helpful, or just more bloat Samsung packed onto the device to try and fool the masses. Let's get to it.\n\nEdge lighting is an S6 feature that allows the edge of the display to light up whenever you receive a phone call or notification. It only works when the phone is faced down and gives users the option to reject calls by long pressing the heart rate sensor (you can even set this up to shoot out a customized quick reply).\n\nEdge lighting also works with People edge, so it'll glow with the color you set for some of your favorite contacts. This is so you can always see who's calling/notifying at a glance. But you know what also works for seeing who's calling at a glance? Setting your phone face up like the good Lord intended.\n\nNot only is Edge lighting almost completely pointless, it's downright dangerous if you care about keeping your phone in pristine condition. You will -- I repeat, will -- be scratching your phone's display if you lay it face down on just about any hard surface. Tiny bits of dirt, salt, or any other micro particles will scratch up the display, Gorilla Glass 4 or not. The only time this feature would even be acceptable is when using a screen protector, but even then -- why not just set the phone upright?\n\nThe People edge is probably going to be the feature most people use on the Galaxy S6 Edge. It's basically a persistent shortcut on the home and lock screen that appears along the right or left side of the phone's display, giving you quick access to your favorite contacts. Pull it out, and you can quickly call, text message, or email one of the contacts you've preselected (up to 5).\n\nSince these contacts are all color coded (blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple), it's easy to see at a glace any missed notifications and quickly address them by tapping on the appropriate icon. There's also an option to have your phone alert you every time you pick it up to ensure you never miss a notification from the people you care about most (or those who keep you on a short leash). You can even toggle what kind of notifications you'd like to receive (missed calls, messages, or emails).\n\nThis is actually a neat feature, don't get us wrong. But it's just one that doesn't really require the Edge screen to exist. It could have been just as helpful on the regular S6. Of course, that doesn't take anything away from People edge which was something we found actually came in handy for the most part.\n\nInformation stream is basically a news ticker that displays feeds according to your interest. Since they're only displayed on the edge screen -- and the main screen is \"turned off\" -- Samsung says it shouldn't eat up too much battery life when displayed. Activating the Information stream (when enabled in Edge screen options) is done by performing a quick swiping gesture on the Edge screen while the phone is sleeping. After that, a ticker will be displayed according to the feeds you've set up and for however long you'd like (15 seconds, or even up to 10 minutes).\n\nOptions for the news ticker are fairly limited at this point and include general Android notifications (specific apps can be turned off, but all are enabled by default). As far as news feeds, Yahoo! News, Twitter Trends, Yahoo! Finance, and Yahoo! Sports available on the device, with the ability to download feeds from Whoscall - Caller ID & Block, RSS Feeds for Edge, and BILD Newsticker. Tapping on a news item will open the browser and pull up the article. Oh, and weather can also be displayed, with the settings controlled by the general Samsung weather app.\n\nWe found Information stream somewhat useful, but couldn't help but feel like it sucked up more battery life than Samsung lets on. This wouldn't have been so much of a big deal if Samsung simply added the option to display Information stream only while the phone is charging.\n\nNight clock is the final Edge screen feature and, well, does exactly what the name suggests. It displays a dimly lit clock on the Edge screen for easy viewing while laying on your nightstand. When enabled, it's up to the user to set the display time and the duration maxes out at 12 hours, so you can't have it on 24/7.\n\nDespite only displaying a dimly lit clock -- which is supposed to keep the \"main screen\" off -- we noticed a good deal of battery drain than when normally sleeping. We activated Night Clock in a pitch black room and actually noticed the entire display was dimly lit. Suddenly that battery drain made a lot more sense. In the end, this meant that unless we were plugged in for the night, Night clock wasn't a viable option for us, again, something Samsung could have easily rectified by adding the option to display only while charging.\n\nNow that we've fully examined the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and every single one of its Edge screen features, it's time to reach a verdict. At $100 extra for the S6 Edge, does the curved display actually bring anything more to the table than sexy good looks? The short answer: no. But does it really have to?\n\nIn a world of cookie cutter smartphones, it's clear someone needed to step out and finally do something different. It just so happened to come from the unlikeliest of places, Samsung, who has done a great job at building a smartphone that looks unlike all the rest and even steals some of the lime light away from beauties like the iPhone 6 or HTC One M9.\n\nAs long as you understand what you're getting, we don't think anyone should feel bad dropping 100 extra dollars for the S6 Edge. People value good design. They do it all the time. I found myself buying more expensive plastic silverware simply because it looked nicer than the cheap stuff. Others may splurge on designer name clothes or shoes because they simply fit better or look nicer than the stuff they find at Walmart. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nWe will say, for the more thrifty buyer, that $100 might be better spent on upgrading the internal storage of the Galaxy S6 (which also sees a $100 jump for every configuration). Just something to keep that in mind if you can't decide between a 32GB S6 Edge, or 64GB regular S6 for the same price.\n\nSure, we found the Edge screen was little more than a gimmick to get you to pluck down more money for a smartphone that does everything the regular version can do. While spending an extra $100 is probably asking a little bit much (Samsung really couldn't have made it only $50 more?), we couldn't help but find ourselves suckered into picking up the S6 Edge over the regular model.\n\nIf you received a little extra dough in your tax refund and have $100 burning a hole in your pocket than by all means, treat yo self. As long as you know what your money is getting you, ain't no one going to fault you for it.", "The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge come with a number of security features that aim to prevent thievery and prying eyes. One of the first layers of security is the Galaxy S6 passcode lock, a feature that works in conjunction with the Galaxy S6's improved fingerprint sensor. Today, we want to show you how to setup the Galaxy S6 passcode lock in an effort to protect your new phone.\n\nIn March, Samsung announced the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, two new flagships that have quickly become two of the best Android smartphones on the market. The two devices come equipped with a number of powerful features including Quad HD displays, gorgeous premium designs, excellent cameras, and a fingerprint sensor for added convenience and security.\n\nThe two devices come with an array of security features including the Android Device Manager that allows users to remotely wipe their phone and Samsung KNOX, a feature aimed at enterprise users. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge also come with some basic security features that take just a few minutes to setup and use.\n\nOne of those features is the Galaxy S6 passcode lock. The Galaxy S6's passcode lock is the first line of defense against potential thieves and friends that like to snoop on your files and your business. Setting up a Galaxy S6 passcode is one the first things you'll want to do when you turn on the phone and we want to show you how to get the most out of the feature.\n\nHere, we show you how to setup a fingerprint passcode, a pattern passcode, a PIN, and a password. Each has a different level of security ranging from low (pattern/PIN) to high (password).\n\nWhen you first turn the Samsung Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge on, the setup process will prompt you input your fingerprints as an added layer of security. This how to assumes that you didn't setup your fingerprint sensor during the initial setup process.\n\nOnce you're in there, you'll notice a Fingerprints section under the Security tab. Tap that. If you've already setup your fingerprint sensor, it may ask for your fingerprint to gain access.\n\nNext, you'll want to select Add Fingerprint and then you'll need to go through the process. The entire process only takes a few minutes as it asks you to input your fingerprint. Once you setup one fingerprint, you can add others. This is useful if you primarily use on hand, or different fingers, to unlock your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6's fingerprint sensor is a touch-based sensor which means that you need only to press your thumb or another finger down to unlock the phone.\n\nIf you spend a ton of time in one place, you'll also want to consider using Smart Lock. To access it, head into Secure Lock Settings in the Lock screen and security section. Once you're there, select Smart Lock.\n\nHere, you can set your trusted places. Once you setup a trusted place, your phone will recognize where it is. If it's in a trusted location, it won't required a fingerprint scan. Once you leave the area though, it will lock itself up.\n\nIn the same Lock screen and security section, you'll find several other lock screen options. To access them, select Screen lock type. Once you're in there, you'll notice a medium security feature called Pattern.\n\nIf you've owned an Android phone at any point before this, pattern will probably be familiar. Pattern allows you to draw a unique pattern to unlock your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nIf you opt to use the Pattern lock feature, the pattern shouldn't be simple. Instead, we recommend a complex pattern that will be hard for people to guess. Just don't make so difficult that you have a hard time remembering it.\n\nYou'll need to input your pattern twice before it sticks.\n\nIf you don't want to have to remember a pattern, and many of you won't, you can make things a little easier on yourself. The PIN feature, found in the same Screen lock type section, allows you to draw up a set of numbers to unlock your phone.\n\nSamsung requires you to use at least four numbers and the PIN can't contain more than 16 digits. We don't recommend using 16 digits unless you have impressive memory recall. Once you decide on a set of numbers, input them and the device will save them as your PIN code.\n\nIf numbers aren't your thing, you can also setup a password to lock your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge. The Password option is found in the Screen lock type section that we've mentioned several times over.\n\nPassword is different from PIN in that it allows you to use letters and characters. Your password must contain at least four characters including one letter. It cannot contain more than 16 characters. Again, you'll want to find a median between simple and complex. It shouldn't be easy to guess nor should it be impossible for you to figure out each time you want to unlock your phone.\n\nEnter your password when it prompts, enter it again to confirm, and your Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge will now be protected by a password.\n\n--\n\nYou can switch between fingerprint, PIN, password, and pattern at any time. One thing to note. While the device will remember your fingerprints, it won't remember your PIN, password or pattern. You'll need to input those each time you switch.", "It's finally official: LG unveiled its next flagship, the LG G4, at events simulcasted throughout the globe. With an exterior engineered around the tenant of \"comfortable elegance\" and a litany of hardware enhancements over last year's model, the Korea-based electronics giant has made what is calls a \"handmade masterpiece.\"\n\nBut the G4 isn't the only fancy new handset on the block. Samsung released its own highly anticipated smartphone, the Galaxy S6, to critical acclaim last month -- DT's own Ted Kritsonis scored them a 4.5/5. And if demand is any indication, it's a very compelling devices in its own right.\n\nThe obvious question, then, is how the G4 measures up to the S6, arguably its biggest rival. While we've yet to put LG's smartphone through its paces, we've cursorily compared the two in the meantime to illustrate the biggest differences.\n\nDesign\n\nWhen you walk into a store, a smartphone's design is what attracts you, and what sticks with you. After all, after you buy that smartphone, you'll see it a countless number of instances every day, for years. It may sound like common sense, but unless you want to end up regretting your purchase every time you pull it out of your pocket, you want a phone with a design that you find pleasing.\n\nLG claims the shock-absorbing bend makes the G4 20 percent more durable than the G3\n\nWhat about the G4's? It's less striking than refined -- there aren't many surprises in store for those already familiar with the LG G3. It adopts the same, inoffensive design language, delegating the speaker, power, and volume buttons to the upper back for a minimalist presentation. It's just as curvaceous, too: the rear panel arcs as it tapers on either side, a contoured bezel borders the display, and the entire outer shell itself is ever-so-slightly curved. That last characteristic is a major selling point -- LG claims the shock-absorbing bend makes the G4 20 percent more durable than the G3. The effect, lucky for those put off by the G Flex 2's exaggerated angle, is nearly imperceptible.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is flat, by contrast. Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and rear, which fabricator Corning claims is twice as tough as Gorilla Glass 3, the iteration in use on the G4. But the display glass is just the beginning of the aesthetic differences between the phones. The Galaxy S6 is a refinement of Samsung's design paradigms, retaining the signature Galaxy home button and sensor placement. There are, however, touches worth noting, like a metal bezel made entirely of aluminum, bottom-level speaker placement (the G4's is on the back), and a bulging camera module.\n\nJeffery Van Camp/Digital Trends\n\nIf some of those sound like compromises, they are. Samsung made them in the pursuit of thinness, which it definitely achieved -- the Galaxy S6 measures just 6.8mm, a number the 9.4mm thick LG G4, can't touch.\n\nBut the G4 is a standout in other areas, namely some of its removable (unlike the S6) back covers. LG says material engineers spent more than three years researching and developing the leather, which uses Gutermann's Mara sewing threads for the stitching. It's very soft to the touch (a characteristic the company attributes to its proprietary, 3-month vegetable tanning process), and in our limited experience it's also fairly resistant to scratching.\n\nIf leather isn't to your liking, though, LG will offer three \"metallic craft\" plastic covers in three colors: \"titan black,\" \"shiny gold,\" and \"ceramic white.\" Like the brushed finish on the G3's rear panel, they definitely won't be mistaken for metal, but they're an appealingly neutral alternative to the more conspicuous leather.\n\nIn terms of coloration, the S6 and G4 are evenly matched. The S6 comes in white, black, gold, and blue, while the G4 will be available in black, beige, blue, and yellow.\n\nWhat about size, you ask? While it's true the G4's display is a few tenths of an inch larger than the Galaxy S6's (5.5 inches versus 5.1 inches), it never feels unwieldy -- like the G3 before it, LG's managed to squeeze the panel into a relatively compact frame. One-handed operation is out of the question for most, but it's never uncomfortably large.\n\n- Winner: LG G4 (so far)\n\nThe LG G4 is more comfortable to hold and practical, but the Galaxy S6 does look prettier with its dual-glass sides.\n\nProcessing power\n\nThe internals are where things get interesting. The Galaxy S6 eschews Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC for the in-house, 64-bit Exynos 7420. It's an eight-core monster of a chip, packing more than enough oomph to send the Galaxy S6 soaring past competitors in benchmarks.\n\nLG chose the less exotic route. A Snapdragon 808 processor powers the G4, which the company says is very purposeful -- it collaborated with Qualcomm to \"optimize\" the processor. LG may have had its reasons to skip the 810, but optimizations may not be enough to push it over the performance gap.\n\n- Winner: TBA\n\nLG's processor is slightly weaker, but may produce better battery life.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Galaxy S6 made the jump to Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) AMOLED to much fanfare, but it was a catch-up move, in a sense -- the G3 achieved that a year ago, but with compromises in brightness and contrast. The G4's panel is an improvement in every way. It's what LG calls a \"Quantum\" LCD IPS display: by using negatively charged liquid crystal instead of the typical positive and leveraging a color-transforming backlight, LG says the G4 is able to reproduce more accurate, less saturated colors than all other competing display technologies.\n\nOur initial comparison between the S6 and G4 screen yielded mixed results. Some colors, like red, looked far better on the G4, but the differences were harder to perceive in photographs with lots of blues and greens. It'll take more testing to make a definitive call, but LCD does have it's inherent drawbacks -- blacks on AMOLED are inherently better, for one, and power consumption is, in some cases, lower. We also noticed a yellowish tinge on the S6, a tinge that remained even after switching off the Adaptive setting in the display options. It's possible we have a bad panel, but a similar, subtler shift towards warmer colors was observable on the our Nexus 6, too. There definitely appears to be something to LG's claims.\n\n- Winner: LG G4 (so far)\n\nHead to head, LG's screen looked better. Samsung also doesn't fully take advantage of its AMOLED screen, rarely showing deep blacks.\n\nBattery and storage\n\nThe other divergences are many. The G4 has a 3000mAh battery, while the S6 settles for 2550mAh. We don't know for sure yet, but we are guessing that the G4 will hold a charge longer. And since it's battery is removable, there is some more flexibility there, as well.\n\nWhen it comes to storage, Samsung has taken the Apple route of removing its MicroSD slot and instead selling 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB models of the Galaxy S6. This is a fine route, but we like LG's decision to make a 32GB model and including a MicroSD slot that can hold up to 2TB cards.\n\n- Winner: LG G4 (by a landslide)\n\nCamera\n\nConsidering the amount of use smartphone cameras get, it's no LG and Samsung spend so much time improving them. The S6, for its part, packs 16-megapixel back-facing shooter with a f/1.9 aperture lens and built-in optical stabilization. That falls slightly short of the G4's specifications: f/1.8 aperture -- \"the brightest lens in the world on a smartphone,\" LG says -- and \"three-dimensional optical stabilization,\" which ups the compensation level and accounts for motion on the z-axis (forward and backward) in addition to the x (vertical) and y axes (horizontal).\n\nJeffery Van Camp/Digital Trends\n\nThat's not the only trick the G4 has up its sleeve, though. LG's \"color spectrum sensor\" is an inconspicuous little meter beneath the flash that uses light and object recognition to \"read color as you understand it with your own eyes.\" It's meant to help automatically adjust white balance and color temperature, but that's proven hard to test in our short time with the G4. It'll take shooting in different lighting environments to highlight the differences, if any, the new sensor makes.\n\n- Winner: LG G4 (so far)\n\nSo far, we are impressed with the LG G4's ability to replicate the natural color of objects and not wash them out, though it did tend to make objects bolder and brighter than in real life.\n\nOverall winner: LG G4 (so far)\n\nSo far, who is the winner? Probably the G4. While we haven't had a chance to thoroughly review the hardware yet, what we've observed so far is enough to give it the edge over the S6. Accessories like leather backing aside, the display's colors are incredibly impressive. The camera, too, seems to take shots at least as bright and colorful as the S6, although we'll have to take a lot more shots to see if it holds up in dimmer lights. And the G4 just feels great in the hand -- it's light and conforms to the curve of your fingers, very unlike the angular and hefty competition.\n\nIf you're in the market for a new smartphone, then, we recommend waiting for the LG G4.

With several companies announcing \"microgrid\" products or projects last month, interest is mounting for power systems that can serve something the size of a corporate campus or a remote community. Stationary batteries can help smooth out the power flow at times when renewables are not producing (lack of wind, or lack of sun, for instance).\n\nAlong with building the multibillion-dollar battery Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla has teamed up with solar installer SolarCity, where Musk is chairman and the top shareholder, on battery-based storage for homes and businesses that have solar panel systems. That stored power can be used when the sun isn't shining.\n\nTesla and SolarCity last month said they've teamed up to build entire tiny power grids using Tesla lithium-ion batteries. Samsung SDI also announced a strategic alliance along similar lines, with global automation technology firm ABB (NYSE:ABB).

On a sequential basis however, shipments declined 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Among smartphone manufacturers, Samsung remained on top with a 27.8% share of Indian smartphone shipments in Q1. That was down 17% from the 33.3% slice of the Indian smartphone market that Sammy owned in the first quarter of 2014. However, the latest data shows a 1.5% increase on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nDespite shipments that are trending lower, Micromax finished behind Samsung with 15.3% of the Indian smartphone market after the first quarter. That is a decline from the 16.7% slice of the Indian smartphone pie that it owned after last year's first quarter, and the 19.5% Micromax owned after Q4 2014.\n\n\"There has been significant push by Indian government for \"Make in India\", and it seems like almost every of the top 10 mobile phone player has expressed their intentions toward setting up a manufacturing plant in India. However, we believe the real \"Make in India\" developments are still a good 12-18 months away due to the lack of component suppliers' ecosystem. Players like Samsung & Micromax which are already assembling phones in India are well positioned to take advantage of early moves to local manufacturing as compared to other players.\"-Counterpoint Research\n\nIntex, Lava and Lenovo finished third, fourth and fifth respectively. All three brands finished the first quarter with a larger share of the Indian smartphone market than the amount they held during last year's first and fourth quarters.\n\nCounterpoint also notes that strong marketing and buyback deals helped Apple iPhone shipments in the quarter. Last year it took Apple 12 months to sell one million iPhone units in the country. This year, it is close to reaching that number of sales in half of the time. Lumia shipments were also strong in India, growing 20% year-over-year for the first quarter. The Microsoft Lumia 535 was a standout performer. While Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi reported lower shipments for the first quarter of this year, Counterpoint says that it was among the top shippers of 4G LTE flavored smartphones into the country. Top Xiaomi models included the Xiaomi Mi Note 4G and the Xiaomi Redmi 2 4G.\n\nOverall, India is now the third largest smartphone market in the world, shipping twice as many smartphones in the first quarter of this year as Japan did.\n\nSamsung continues to top India's smartphone market\n\nsource: CounterpointResearch via fonearena", "LED LCD is the dominant TV display technology by far, especially now that plasma is dead. Its only potential competitor is OLED, found on few high-end TVs made exclusively by LG. Here's a look at the pros and cons of each.\n\nFor the last decade or so TV buyers were forced to answer the question \"LCD or plasma?\" with their hard-earned dollars. Now plasma has been removed from consideration.\n\nPretty much every sold today TV is based on good old LCD technology, whether manufacturers choose to call them \"LED TVs,\" \"SUHD\" TVs or something even more futuristic-sounding like Quantum Dot TVs.\n\nThe exception is OLED. Televisions based on Organic Light Emitting Diode display technology are fundamentally different from LCD TVs. The most basic difference is that each pixel provides its own illumination, while all of the pixels in an LCD TV are illuminated by an LED backlight.\n\nRelated articles OLED vs. LED vs LED vs plasma The state of OLED Improving the LCD What is Samsug's SUHD?\n\nThe first OLED TVs started shipping in 2013. For now they're only made by LG and they're quite expensive, starting at $2500 for the 55EC9300. Judging from the performance of that TV, however, OLED is a picture quality force to be reckoned with.\n\nOLED may be the picture quality heir apparent, but LCD isn't going down without a fight, introducing plenty of new variants that could keep the contest close for years to come.\n\nSo which one is better? Read on for their strengths and weaknesses. In general we'll be comparing OLED to the best (read: most expensive) LCD has to offer, mainly because there's no such thing as a cheap OLED TV. And when a particular advantage is likely to change in the future (read: next year) we've marked it \"(for now)\".\n\nIf you're curious how LCDs work check out LED LCD backlights explained and LED local dimming explained. If you're curious about OLED, check out The State of OLED.\n\nLight output (brightness)\n\nWinner: LCD\n\nLoser: OLED\n\nBoth TV types are very bright compared to plasma, and can look equally good in a sunny room. When it comes down to it, no modern TV could ever be considered \"dim\".\n\nLCD gets the nod here specifically because the whole screen can be brighter, a function of its backlight. OLED can't do a full screen as bright, but parts of the image can be as bright, or brighter, than many LCDs. Full-screen brightness isn't very important in the real world, however, so this category is a relatively hollow victory for LCD.\n\nLight output also plays a big part in High Dynamic Range (HDR), which we'll discuss a little later.\n\nBlack level\n\nWinner: OLED\n\nLoser: LCD\n\nAt the other side of light output is black level, or how dark the TV can get. OLED wins here because of its ability to turn off individual pixels completely. It can truly produce perfect black.\n\nThe better LCDs have local dimming, where sections of the screen can dim independently of others. This isn't quite as good as per-pixel control because the black parts still aren't absolute, but it's better than nothing. The best LCDs have full array local dimming, which provides even finer control over the contrast of what's on screen, but even they can suffer from \"blooming,\" where a bright area spoils the black of an adjacent black area.\n\nCheck out LED LCD backlights explained and LED local dimming explained for more info.\n\nContrast ratio\n\nWinner: OLED\n\nLoser: LCD\n\nHere's where it comes together. Contrast ratio is the difference between the brightest a TV can be, and the darkest. OLED's the winner because it can get nearly as bright as LCD, and produce absolute black with no blooming. It has the best contrast ratio of any modern display.\n\nContrast ratio is the most important aspect of picture quality, even though it's rarely measured (or even talked about) these days. A high contrast ratio display will look more realistic than one with a lower contrast ratio.\n\nFor more info, check out What is contrast ratio? and Contrast ratio (or how every TV manufacturer lies to you).\n\nResolution\n\nTie\n\nThis one's easy. Both OLED and LCD are widely available in Ultra HD 4K form. In fact there's only one current 1080p OLED, the aforementioned 55EC9300, and it might be the last of its kind. With LCD, plenty of 1080p models are available too.\n\nRefresh Rateand Motion Blur\n\nWinner: LCD\n\nLoser: OLED\n\nRefresh rate is important in reducing motion blur, or the blurring of anything on screen that moves (including the whole image if the camera pans). Sadly, the current version of OLED has motion blur, just like LCD.\n\nOLEDs, and all current 4K TVs, have a 120 Hz refresh rate. Cheaper LCDs are 60Hz and some 1080p LCDs are available up to 240 Hz, though the marketing suggests much higher rates.\n\nMarketing is one thing, but according to CNET's tests the LG 55EC9300 topped out at 600 lines, while many high-end LCDs hit 1,200, thanks technologies like scanning backlights and black-frame insertion that are just as important to busting blur as native refresh rate. That's why LCD wins for now.\n\nThe only other OLED CNET tested has extensively, the Samsung KN55S9C from 2013, scored higher on our motion resolution test. So there is hope for OLED in this category.\n\nCheck out What is refresh rate? and Fake refresh rates: Is your TV really 120Hz? for more.\n\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR)\n\nWinner: LCD\n\nLoser: OLED (for now)\n\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) is one of the upcoming technologies that could significantly improve picture quality. It's an expansion of contrast ratio, an improvement in brightness, and more. The demos we've seen of it look impressive, but we'll have to wait until the end of the year to see what real TVs with real HDR content (via 4K Blu-Ray or streaming), look like. For now, there are just a handful of very expensive LED LCD models that are compatible.\n\nLG has shown a HDR-capable OLED, but it's a prototype and none of the 2015 models support HDR.\n\nAlso check out HDR for photography vs. HDR for TVs: What's the difference?.\n\nExpanded Color Gamut\n\nWinner: LCD\n\nLoser: OLED (for now)\n\nAnother of the new TV technologies rolling out this year is expanded color gamut. On TVs capable of supporting it, and while viewing content that has it, a wider range and richness of colors will be possible. There are several TVs, using tech like quantum dots, that will be able to show expanded colors once there are discs that have content, which should happen later this year with 4K Blu-ray.\n\nThe current LG OLEDs use blue and yellow phosphors, and red, green, and blue color filters, to create the full spectrum of ATSC color. Is it possible for these to be tweaked to work with the expanded color gamuts coming? Possibly, but for now none of the LG OLEDs (unlike its Prime UHD LCD TVs, for example) markets color gamut compatibility.\n\nCheck out Ultra HD 4K TV color, part I: Red, green, blue and beyond and Ultra HD 4K TV color, part II: The (near) future for more info.\n\nViewing angle\n\nWinner: OLED\n\nLoser: LCD\n\nOne of the main downsides to LCD TVs is a change in picture quality if you sit away from dead center (as in, off to the sides). How much this maters to you certainly depends on your seating arrangement, and how much you love your loved ones.\n\nA few LCDs use In-Plane Switching (IPS) panels, which have better off-axis picture quality than other kinds of LCDs, but don't look as good as other LCDs straight on (due primarily to a lower contrast ratio). If you're sitting off to the side, curved screens may let you see the far side of the screen better, but the closer side is going to be as bad (or worse).\n\nOLED doesn't have the off-axis issue LCDs have. Its image looks basically the same even from extreme angles.\n\nUniformity\n\nWinner: OLED\n\nLoser: LCD\n\nUniformity refers to the consistently of brightness across a TV's screen. Most edge-lit LED LCDs are pretty terrible with this, \"leaking\" light from their edges.\n\nOLED is much better from what we've seen. Unlike plasma, however, it isn't perfect, with some early models having parts of the screen slightly dimmer. We're anxious to check out forthcoming flat OLED TVs because the curve might be responsible for some of OLED's uniformity issues.\n\nEnergy consumption\n\nWinner: LED LCD\n\nRunner-up: OLED\n\nOLED's energy consumption is directly related to screen brightness. The brighter the screen, the more power it draws. It even varies with content. A dark movie will require less power than a hockey game or ski competition.\n\nLCDs energy consumption only varies depending on the backlight setting. The lower the backlight, the lower the power consumption. A basic LED LCD with its backlight set low will draw less power than OLED.\n\nThe only way to make OLED more energy efficient is to reduce its brightness, but since that reduces its contrast ratio as well, it's not ideal. So we'll give this category to LCD, even though it's fairly close and neither uses much power. Assuming average energy costs, running the LG 55EC9300 55-inch OLED five hours a day in its brightest picture mode only costs about $45 per year.\n\nCheck out What you need to know about TV power consumption for more info.\n\nLifespan\n\nTie?\n\nLG has only said that OLED will have \"similar\" lifespan to LED LCDs. But since no one has definitive numbers on how long LED LCDs last, this is pretty vague.\n\nSince OLED is a newer technology, if you're the type of person who can't stop worrying about the longevity of their TV, well, I guess LCD is your only option. Though keep in mind, there's no guarantee about those either, as any glance at Amazon or Internet forums will tell you.\n\nGenerally though, flat panels are very reliable.\n\nBurn-in\n\nToo early to tell\n\nAll TV's can \"burn in,\" or develop what's called \"image persistence,\" where a ghost of an image remains on screen. It's really hard to do this with LCDs. It's seems to be easier with OLED, but they're how susceptible they are to permanent image retention is still unclear.\n\nRegardless, don't leave a static image on screen all night.\n\nPrice\n\nWinner: LCD\n\nLoser: OLED\n\nYou can get 50-inch LCDs for around $500. The oft-cited 55-inch LG 55EC9300 costs 5 times that, and 65-inch models start at $9,000.\n\nThat said, OLED will get cheaper, and we've already seen dramatic price drops in just the last year.\n\nAlso, the most expensive LED LCDs that deign to compete with OLED for picture quality, including the full-array local dimming, HDR models with expanded color gamuts and the fixins' mentioned above, are in the $6000 to $8000 range themselves.\n\nAnd the picture quality winner is...OLED\n\nLCD dominates the market because it's cheap to manufacture and delivers good enough picture quality for just about everybody. But according to CNET's comparison reviews and multi-TV shoot-outs, OLED wins for picture quality, largely due to the incredible contrast ratio.\n\nWith the advent of HDR and expanded color gamut, that could change. We'll have to see if OLED is able to continue beating LCDs that have these new technologies.\n\nNo matter what, though, the death of plasma hasn't caused the step-back in picture quality many of us feared. In fact, we seem to be moving even further forward, with potentially better LCDs than ever.\n\nOn the high-end, at least. The budget LCDs of today can't hold a candle to the budget plasmas of yore. Oh well. Sic transit gloria.\n\nGot a question for Geoff?

Like the successful companies that have risen out of the neighbouring Taiwan and South Korea, Chinese tech companies are gradually moving from simply producing devices to controlling and selling them under their own brands. That's how Asus, HTC, Samsung, and LG all rose to prominence: following Western blueprints and capitalizing on already having the means of production for advanced technological devices.\n\nThe difference now, though, is that China is a leader in tech consumption, not merely production. Being amazingly successful in a smaller country like South Korea can surely be lucrative, but Samsung products had to go global for the company's success to be globally significant. Xiaomi, Huawei, and Lenovo's own-brand smartphones, on the other hand, collect almost all of their sales in their native China. And they are the three companies tussling for third place behind Apple and Samsung in the global smartphone sales rankings.\n\n\"Success in China almost guarantees a place in the top 10 global market share stakes,\" explains mobile industry analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight. \"That comes with associated benefits. Scale equals a strong position in the supply chain, component procurement, and more cost-effective manufacturing.\" He cautions that popularity in China is no guarantee of global success -- citing Huawei's extensive and so far relatively unsuccessful investment into establishing itself as a global brand -- but that might not actually matter. HTC and LG are global brands, but their sales are being eclipsed by the relatively obscure Xiaomi.\n\nFour years ago, Nokia believed the key to its healthy survival as a mobile manufacturer was gaining a foothold in the crucial US market. It was taken as a given that to succeed in such a hyper-competitive industry, a company had to establish itself in the most important market -- but is that still the United States? Today we are seeing companies thriving without any significant US presence. Xiaomi has no plans to test US waters, but it has growing revenues and a vibrant user base. It also has the lead in Chinese smartphone volume sales, eclipsing the mighty iPhone and Galaxy smartphones.\n\nThe recognition of China's importance is evident everywhere in the mobile industry. HTC is, for the first time, introducing two flagship smartphones this year, with the One M9+ being tailored to the needs and preferences of the Chinese market. In February, around the turn of the Chinese New Year, Lenovo brought Motorola back to China, setting it up as a sort of exotic alternative to local offerings, one where user customization is paramount.\n\nBut no one has benefited from China's growing appetite for smartphones more than Apple. Even as the developed world was becoming saturated with iPhones, Apple kept expanding its sales with the help of China. The iPhone first became available in China in 2009, relatively early in its now gloried history, and has kept growing in line with the country's expansion in disposable income and smartphone demand. This past quarter, Apple sold more iPhones in China than in the United States, belying prognostications that the Chinese market wouldn't be receptive to such a premium, high-margin device.\n\nBen Evans of Andreessen Horowitz explains this phenomenon succinctly: it's all down to income inequality. Even while the country suffers from widespread rural poverty and the most common phone purchases are of devices with negligible profit margins, \"there are, say, 100 million people in China who can buy luxury goods, and they want the best.\" And, according to a recent survey of Chinese millionaires, the best when it comes to making luxury purchases and gifts is Apple. Ahead of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Cartier, and Bvlgari. Interestingly, Samsung also makes it into the top 10 rankings in that survey, which suggests a close association in the Chinese consumer's mind between advanced technology and luxury. The Apple Watch Edition is a product that sits at precisely this intersection of electronics and opulence.\n\n\"That's why the 5C flopped in China\" after doing just fine in the USA, continues Evans. Apple's appeal is about status first and specifications second. Still, the Cupertino company unlocked a great deal of untapped Chinese demand when it introduced larger iPhones late last year, leading to the most profitable quarter in corporate history. \"For a range of reasons, the Chinese like big phones,\" says Evans, and \"when Apple offered one, they switched away from Samsung.\"\n\nThe phablet-sized iPhone 6 Plus might not exist were it not for China's predilection for bigger screens. The One M9+ certainly wouldn't. Only Japan, by virtue of its insularity and specific requirements for things like waterproofing, and the US could previously command such tailored solutions to their customers' whims. But just as China has surpassed Japan to become the world's second biggest economy, so have the preferences of its consumers risen in global importance. Apple still hasn't made a waterproof iPhone for the Japanese, but it's shown itself highly responsive to Chinese needs. The difference is scale.\n\nMobile analyst Avi Greengart summarizes the demands of the Chinese consumer as follows: \"Chinese consumers prize status, absolute value, and local content.\" Because Apple already has the luxury status, it can afford to sell its devices at a premium that other smartphone brands can only dream of commanding. When Apple presented greater value with its literally greater iPhones, China responded enthusiastically and bought even more. The local content aspect is Apple's greatest weakness so far, and it's where the local manufacturers continue to hold an advantage. Though that's apparently not big enough of a hurdle to prevent record iPhone sales.\n\nThe recent trend in the smartphone market has been a polarization between the two premium global leaders -- Apple and Samsung, who can sell high-end devices at a healthy profit -- and the litany of smaller manufacturers engaged in a price war that sees them barely scraping by. Just take a look at HTC's operating margin for the past three quarters: it's gone from 0.4 percent, to 0.3, to 0.05 percent. The middle class of smartphone manufacturers like HTC is being squeezed out of existence by the big guys at the top and the geographically limited Chinese companies that have smaller costs and cheaper manufacturing. And it's all down to China's scale. It amplifies everything happening within the country's economy to the point where it affects the entire world. China wants its phones to either represent high status or great value for money, so that's what we've got: the premium iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, on the one hand, and the spec-laden Xiaomi Mi Note and OnePlus One, on the other.\n\nChina isn't the absolute kingmaker of the mobile world just yet, but its influence is already enormous, with many believing it to be of preeminent importance. \"There is no doubt China is the most important market to be successful in, way more so than the US,\" says Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. \"Smartphone growth is now coming from emerging countries. That's the new battleground with China and India playing a key role.\" The growth of those economies has sprung up a fundamentally new and different mobile industry, where established global leaders like HTC, LG, Sony, and Microsoft's mobile division struggle to find their proper place. Apple, on the other hand, has taken a comfortable seat at the top of the heap and is weathering this disruption in luxurious style.", "Apple's large-screen iPhones are a big hit in China, taking market share from Samsung and selling at a pace that may make China a greater source of revenue than the Americas for Apple in coming years, analysts said.\n\nThe world's most valuable consumer electronics company reported on Monday a 71 percent increase in sales in China to $16.8 billion, driven by its new, bigger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. In the first three months of the year, for the first time, Apple (AAPL.O) sold more iPhones in China than in the United States.\n\nConsumer demand for the newest electronics pushed sales in China to 29 per cent of total global sales for Apple in the first quarter, compared with 21 percent a year ago. By comparison, the Americas represent 37 per cent of total sales, but are growing more slowly at only 19 per cent last quarter.\n\n\"The bigger screens on iPhone 6 have been selling like hot cakes,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in New York, who estimated that China could represent as much as 40 percent of Apple's revenue by 2017. For Apple, China is \"the golden goose,\" he said.\n\nThe surge in sales, helped by Chinese New Year gift-buying, was caused by a latent build-up in demand, analysts said. \"Apple fans in China had been waiting years for bigger-screen iPhones and they are upgrading at a furious rate to the new models,\" said Neil Mawston, executive director at research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nSamsung won over millions of Chinese mobile customers four years ago with its Galaxy Note 'phablet', creating a whole new category somewhere between a phone and a tablet, with screen sizes of more than five inches diagonally, compared to the previous standard of about four inches.\n\nApple is starting to win some of them back again.\"Apple really had no choice but to come back with a bigger screen iPhone for the 5-inch category to bring those switchers back, and that's precisely what they've done,\" said Mawston.\n\nEasier to write in Chinese\n\nChinese customers gravitated naturally to the bigger screen size, as it makes it easier to input Chinese characters with a finger or stylus on the screen and is more effective for video.", "HTC One M9 has got away from its much touted Ultrapixel shooter, which was also present in the One M8. HTC also rectified the camera hardware in order to make it work better. The latest feature to collaborate with One M9 camera, is the facility to save and send pictures in the RAW format.\n\nFor all those wondering what is it, RAW is a setting which can be usually found on digital cameras, it is basically a file type option that is preferred by ace photographers over the JPEG format because it captures the picture as it is (in its original texture).\n\nThe latest update for this feature doesn't even require a firmware correction, unlike many other OEMs, HTC had already worked on the basic apps, so that users would just be required to update the camera app right away through Google Play.\n\nInterestingly, the same feature LG announced on its G4. This update by HTC surely seems to rival LG's latest flagship in terms of camera hardware.\n\nThe RAW feature won't come very handy for most of the general users. Especially, If a user is clicking a picture to simply upload on the Instagram, this feature will not really matter that much. Now, talking about the casual photographers HTC has also added image filters (even the third-part ones will work well). Also, this feature will not enable itself by default, in order to save the photo in RAW format, users would be required to go into the camera app settings and turn it on.\n\nMoreover, RAW plays an important role when using photo editing apps like, CameraBag 2, or Photoshop. RAW provides enhanced editing control, and it doesn't end up compressing the images, unlike the JPEG format.\n\nHTC One M9 is the first device to roll out an update for RAW support, even the devices like Samsung Galaxy S6 or S6 edge lack the feature.", "Virtual reality is great for getting closer to things. And for so many young people, it doesn't get much better than getting close to celebrity athletes and superheroes.\n\n72andSunny's new Samsung campaign has plenty of both, thanks to the client's stable of star atheletes and its partnership with Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron. The centerpiece is a two-minute VR experience for the Galaxy S6 and Gear VR Headset in which you're placed dead center in the middle of a battle between the Avengers and Ultron robots.\n\nAdweek previewed the impressive VR experience last week. (It will be available for download later today at the Oculus Store.) Those without a Gear headset can still get an approximation of it, though. The YouTube video below was designed as a 360-degree experience -- if you watch it on an Android device, you can move the phone around in all directions and see difference parts of the room as the action unfolds:\n\nFor the 72andSunny creatives, it was a nice way to continue to experiment in the burgeoning VR space. \"It's kind of like looking at a sculpture instead of looking at a photograph,\" partner and executive creative director Bryan Rowles said. \"You have to make sure everything is moving and interesting at all times.\"\n\nThe larger campaign, themed \"We Are Greater Than I,\" is part of the Galaxy S6 launch globally and is built around the idea of teamwork. That's a theme for Samsung across its sports and entertainment projects, and it's a theme of The Avengers as well -- thus, the partnership was nice conceptual fit.\n\n72andSunny also made two cinematic films for the campaign, in which four celebrity athletes and two superfans are recruited to be Avengers themselves. The athletes include official Samsung endorsers Lionel Messi, surfer John John Florence and cyclist Fabian Cancellara -- as well as Green Bay Packers running back Eddie Lacy (who isn't a Samsung athlete but who got the gig mostly because wears a Hulk Under Armour compression shirt under his football jersey).\n\nCheck out those films here:\n\n\"We didn't want the films to be dead ends,\" said Rowles. \"That's where the virtual reality experience came about. You get to experience this campaign, not just watch a film about it.\"\n\nThe third piece of the campaign extends to the real world, as Samsung is distributing 1,000 briefcases globally that will have a Galaxy S6 in it, plus the VR goggles with the Avengers VR experience preloaded on the phone.\n\nMany more people will see the films than experience the VR. But Jamie Park, head of experiential marketing at Samsung Mobile headquarters in South Korea, tells Adweek that even limited reach with the VR can have a remarkable effect.\n\n\"We've seen a growing interest from studios around the additive experience VR can deliver to fan engagement,\" Park said. \"We have been partnering with other brands to help create VR storytelling content, and you will continue to see more of that in the future. We believe that a single great experience can create an enormously positive impact that will help strengthen both brands and build long-term customer loyalty.\"", "With the month of April coming to a close and Android 5.0 Lollipop update details continuing to swirl, we want to take a look at the most important things Samsung Galaxy Note 3 users need to know about the Galaxy Note 3 Android 5.0 Lollipop release.\n\nApril has been an extremely busy month for Samsung and its carrier partners. The company released two brand new flagships in the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge and its also been pushing a number of Android 5.0 Lollipop updates to its former flagship phones and tablets.\n\nWe've seen the Samsung Galaxy S5 Lollipop update make solid progress. We've seen the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop updates push out to users all over the globe. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update has finished up in the United States. Even the Samsung Galaxy S4 Lollipop release has been gaining steam.\n\nIn particular, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop release has been picking up pace as we push through the month of April toward the summer. We've seen a flurry of new updates roll out and we've seen several new release details arrive for owners of the aging phone. Samsung's been pushing updates rapid fire and we want to make sure that you're caught up to speed as we move into a new month.\n\nToday, we take a look at the progress of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update as we outline the most recent and the most important details that've emerged in the past four weeks.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update is humming along. In the United States, all five Galaxy Note 3 carriers including AT&T and Verizon have updated their models with Android 5.0 Lollipop. U.S. Cellular rolled out its Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update a few days ago, the last US carrier to do so. Owners can check for these updates in the device's settings.\n\nSamsung's been busy outside of the United States as well and we've seen a number of updates push out in the past two weeks. The company's Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update recently pushed out for users in Germany, Switzerland, Poland, and Russia. There's still plenty of work left to do but April was extremely kind to the Note 3.\n\nWe haven't seen many carriers confirm details ahead of time but we do expect May to be a busy month for the Galaxy Note 3. Samsung hasn't said anything but it's clear that we're finally in the thick of the Note 3's roll out.\n\nOwners of international Galaxy Note 3 models will want to keep an eye out for carrier-specific information. Samsung has a tendency to keep a low profile during its roll outs and specific information typically comes from carriers themselves.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update has made great strides but there are still plenty of carriers that remain silent about their plans for the Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop update. This doesn't mean that they won't release the update but what it does mean is that the releases are probably weeks or perhaps even months out.\n\nInternational carriers like Vodafone and Telstra in Australia typically confirm updates once they reach the carrier testing phase. They, and plenty of other carriers, haven't confirmed anything. At least not yet.\n\nThe testing process can be extremely unpredictable and we've already seen several Galaxy-bound Lollipop updates hit snags behind the scenes. The same could happen to the Galaxy Note 3. We'll continue to keep users updated in the month of May which again figures to be extremely busy for Galaxy Note 3 carriers around the world.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo, a niche version of the Galaxy Note 3, hasn't seen its Android 5.0 Lollipop update and it's still not clear when it might roll out to users.\n\nIn late March, Samsung France confirmed a Galaxy Note 3 Neo Lollipop update. At the time, the company said that the update would be rolled out sometime over the \"course of the year.\" The information was intentionally vague because everything depends on the testing process.\n\nWe haven't seen Samsung France or anyone else provide any updates so Galaxy Note 3 Neo users will need to remain patient as Samsung works to get the update ready for public consumption.\n\nAs the Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop roll out grows in size, so do the complaints about the software. In the past month, we've seen and heard a ton of complaints about Galaxy Note 3 Lollipop problems. While there are third-party fixes available, bug fixes for US variants are nowhere in sight.\n\nIt is, however, encouraging to see Samsung roll out bug fix updates for devices like the Galaxy S4. It means that we could see it roll out bug fixes for the Galaxy Note 3 (and perhaps, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo as well) down the road.\n\nRemember, bug fix updates are unpredictable and random so Galaxy Note 3 users will want to keep an eye and an ear out as we move from April to May. Those that can't wait will want to take a look at our fixes for common Galaxy Note 3 problems.\n\nWe still don't have a read on bug fixes for users in and outside of the United States but we do have a read on Samsung's next big project. Samsung is working on an Android 5.1 Lollipop update.\n\nSamsung's next version of Lollipop is all but confirmed for the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge and there's a chance that it will roll out to devices like the Galaxy Note 3 down the road. We haven't heard anything specific for the Galaxy Note 3 but it's still an update that Galaxy Note 3 users should be paying attention to as we move out of the month of April.\n\nFirst off, there's a good chance that it will come with bug fixes for Lollipop problems. More importantly, it appears that Samsung is tacking on a Guest Mode feature that allows Galaxy users to setup several unique profiles. This is important for those that share their phone with their kids, family members or with friends and co-workers.\n\nIt's not clear when Samsung plans to start pushing the update in force but that should become clearer as we push into the summer.", "The LG G4 is coming to market with a leather back, the HTC One M9 looks the same as last year, and the Sony Xperia Z4 isn't coming to the United States. The iPhone has rounded edges now, and they've released a big one, too! Even the Samsung Galaxy S6 is pretty much just an internal upgrade on what was delivered last year, when you consider the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. This device, I contend, is the future of the aesthetically pleasing smartphone.\n\nFashion has suddenly become important. With the launch of the iPhone 6, it's like a blast from nowhere: packs of technology enthusiasts fancy themselves fashionistas, deciding which band to buy with their next multi-hundred-dollar accessory.\n\nAccessories for accessories, that is.\n\nBut I'm not talking about fashion. The Galaxy S6 Edge sits in your pocket most of the day, after all.\n\nI'm talking about industrial design, and graphic design.\n\nI believe the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is the most well-designed smartphone ever created by Samsung, and that it might be the most aesthetically pleasing smartphone released in the past several years.\n\nOn the back of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge you've got a bit of a lump where the camera array juts out.\n\nAt first glance, the camera doesn't look great. It's not a very user-aware sort of lump either, when you first start to try to get used to it. I feel like I'm about to get a big gash in the lens glass every time I put the device down.\n\nUpon closer inspection, however, there are several extremely well-thought-out elements here around the lens.\n\nFirst - the glass leading up to the metal rim around the glass the covers the lens leaves an indistinguishable gap. Small enough that no dust appears after using the device several weeks.\n\nThe same is true of the gap between the metal rim and the glass of the camera lens.\n\nThe transition from one glass to the other is one that won't be tarnished any time soon.\n\nIn previous Samsung Galaxy smartphones, the collection of sensors and LED flashes has been directly below the camera array, making the device a bit more symmetrical.\n\nBut we don't want symmetrical, we want beautiful.\n\nSometimes symmetrical can be beautiful, sure, but a mix of symmetry and asymmetry makes the difference between mechanical and natural, art and design. Samsung has reached a point where they've got a healthy balance.\n\nOn the right of the phone you've got a single power/lock button, while on the left you've got your volume up and volume down buttons. At first the power button looks like it's been placed randomly.\n\nBut look to the volume buttons and you'll see. First, there's approximately enough space above the top bottom for another button of the same size, creating a natural place for the remaining two buttons to rest.\n\nAcross the phone and down one more space you'll find the next button - the power button.\n\nThese buttons also sit in perfect positions for your pointer finger and thumb - if you're right-handed.\n\nThe edge on the Galaxy S6 Edge is the real crown on this design, opening up the device's design where all previous smart machines were closed.\n\nGenerally I'm not a fan of devices with no bezel at all. The few that exist leave no room for your eye to rest, a place where your eye naturally knows to stop. With the Galaxy S6 Edge, you still get that resting place for your eyes while the sides of the phone fall away.\n\nThe smooth transition from the top and bottom of the phone to the sides with a dip make for a design that doesn't waste any space.\n\nNot that the display itself doesn't waste any space, since it kind of does when you consider the curve and the oddity of the edges of the screen when viewing content full-screen. But the oddity is far outweighed by the unique experience.\n\nThe experience that feels completely natural now that I've used the device for several weeks.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is a fantastic smartphone in its own right. It has a top-tier camera, an operating system that's cleaner than any Samsung smartphone released in the past, and it rolls with a display that's absolutely gorgeous.\n\nIt's also a sign of great things to come.\n\nSamsung is in the perfect position to continue to create devices like this - devices that push the boundaries of what a smartphone can look like while remaining usable in the real world.\n\nDevices that function and compete with the best smartphones in the world while remaining on the cutting edge, creating a look and a feel that no other company has yet accomplished.\n\nI look forward not only to more Samsung smart devices, but to more competition from other industry leaders - and newcomers to the smartphone design world - as well.", "Welcome to Daily Deals, the regular post where we search for discounts, sales, offers, and money off hardware and software for you, the discerning MacNN and Electronista reader.

Can the company's 2015 flagship, the LG G4, do better? We can start by comparing the two phones' features and specs.\n\nThe LG G3 had an excellent ratio of screen size to phone size. Though the G4 is still doing well in that department, it actually takes a micro-step backward: it has the same screen size, but is 2 percent taller and 1 percent wider.\n\nThe G4 is also 10 percent thicker than its predecessor. But keep in mind these are rounded backs we're looking at, so they're naturally going to be thicker than uniformly thin phones like the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6.\n\nThe G4 is also 3 percent heavier than the G4.\n\nThe LG G4 isn't the first genuine leather phone we've seen (Motorola offers a leather-clad variant of the Moto X), but it's still nice to see some premium materials on an LG flagship.\n\nThe leather G4 is only one (likely more expensive) option, however. Other versions of the G4 will have plastic backs, coated with either metallic or ceramic finishes.\n\nLG likes to make the fronts and sides of its phones completely buttonless, instead placing the volume and power keys in a vertical configuration on the phones' backsides.\n\nThe leather version of the G4 will ship in both brown and black variants. The \"metallic craft\" plastic model has a darker gray color, while the \"ceramic craft\" plastic G4 is a lighter cream color.\n\nNo differences here, as we still have an ample 5.5 inches of screen real estate on the new model.\n\nThe G3 was the first flagship with a Quad HD display, and the G4 sticks with that 1440p resolution. LG does say that its new screen has 20 percent more accurate colors, 50 percent better contrast (perhaps trying to make up some ground vs. AMOLED screens' biggest strength) and gets 25 percent brighter.\n\nBoth handsets use IPS panels, though LG is describing that upgraded display in the G4 as \"IPS Quantum.\"\n\nIt isn't a pronounced curve like on the LG G Flex 2, but the G4's screen (along with the phone itself) has a slight curve to it.\n\nThere's no 16 GB version of the G4; it ships with 32 GB internal storage by default.\n\nBoth handsets let you expand that internal storage by popping in a microSD card.\n\nThe G3's RAM was either 2 GB or 3 GB, depending on which storage option you went with. The G4 comes standard with 3 GB.\n\nLG stuck with the same size of battery in this year's flagship.\n\nSamsung sealed the Galaxy S6's battery shut, but LG still lets you swap out its G-phones' batteries.\n\nQualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 - found in many recent Android flagships - isn't in either of these phones.\n\nThe non-US version of the G3 shipped by default with wireless charging tech built-in. The G4 doesn't appear to even give you that option (at least not without the help of a case).\n\nThe G4's rear camera jumps up to 16 MP, from the 13 MP found in the 2014 model.\n\nThe new model's camera also has a quick-launch shortcut. Instead of using a home button double-tap to launch the camera app, like on the Galaxy S6, the G4 lets you actually take a picture (without even turning the screen on, if you're so inclined) by double-tapping the volume down key.\n\nIncidentally, LG says that the G4's camera app can fire up in 6/10 of a second. We'll need to test that ourselves, but if that holds up it will beat the GS6's less than two seconds record.\n\nThe G4's front-facing camera gets an even bigger boost, climbing all the way to 8 MP.\n\nLG is touting the G4's wide \u0192/1.8 aperture as a selling feature. The company says that it lets in 80 percent more light than the G3's \u0192/2.4 camera.\n\nLG's laser-based autofocus, which quickly measures the distance from sensor to subject, returns in the G4.\n\nBoth phones have Optical Image Stabilization in their rear cameras, but LG says the OIS in the G4 is improved over last year's version.\n\nPerhaps due to overheating concerns, LG passed on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 in the G4, going instead with the slightly less powerful (but still 64-bit) Snapdragon 808.\n\nThe G3 is running Android 5.0 Lollipop, while the G4 will launch with Android 5.1 at its core. LG also has some tweaks to its custom UI in the new model (we'll have more on that when we review the G4).\n\nLG hasn't announced exact US release info yet, but the G4 is already available for sale in the company's native South Korea. For what it's worth, the G3 launched in the US in July, around two months after its Korean debut.\n\nWe also don't know what the G4 will retail for when it launches stateside. That asterisk next to the G3's price is there because that price will vary a bit (you can find it for as little as US$375 on Amazon).\n\nDitto for on-contract pricing: we'll have to wait and see.", "-- Windows Tablets added 1.1 points of market share in Q1 2015 year-on-year\n\nBOSTON, April 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Windows-based Tablets continued to grab more market share from competitor-branded Tablets by Apple and Google in the first quarter of 2015.

The electric car manufacturer is expected to unveil a home and commercial power storage solution. Tesla is said to be at the forefront of innovative battery technology and its $5 billion Gigafactory in Nevada, that is currently under construction, is expected to be the largest battery manufacturing facility across the globe when it opens in 2017.\n\nKeeping in view Tesla's high ambitions, with respect to its battery production, Bernstein analysts have assessed as to how much of the company's entire value is on part of its battery manufacturing division, said to contribute significantly to earnings once its fully operational. It should be noted that Bernstein doesn't cover Tesla's stock and therefore doesn't have a rating and a price target on it. Analysts at the firm value the Gigafactory at $40-$100 per one Tesla share or 20%-40% of the stock's current price. The Gigafactory that is expected to be operational in the next two years, reportedly with a production capacity that is greater than the entire battery manufacturing industry in 2013.\n\nThe investment firm sees robust growth for Tesla's battery division in the near term, noting that the company has substantial cost advantage with its small cylindrical battery technology, over competing manufacturers operating in the same segment. They however note that as suppliers such as Panasonic, Samsung SDI and LG Chem, upgrade their own technological capabilities, Tesla would lose its cost advantage.\n\nBernstein estimates that by 2020, when the Gigafactory ramps up to provide a production output of 35GWh, Tesla would account for 19% of the overall industry supply. Five years after that this will decline to 8%, as competitors make increasing developments in NMC based large prismatic-cells. Although Tesla's NCA-based small cylindrical cells are adequate for cars like the one's it manufactures, Bernstien believes it will face a tough time in the energy storage space due to the presence of NMC-based prismatic cells, that are more preferred in the segment.\n\nThe firm also added that Tesla could greatly benefit from SolarCity, which is majority-owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. As SolarCity expands it network of clean energy solutions using home battery storage as key component, Tesla's Gigafactory would see ample demand for it products.\n\nEven so Bernstein maintains that Tesla's prospects, with regards to battery production, 'go beyond SolarCity and luxury motor vehicles'. Bernstein notes that if Tesla succeeds in its greater objectives, which is to 'transform energy into technology' in the process shaking up auto and energy markets across the globe, the above mentioned value for the Gigafactory would be greatly understated.\n\nBernstien noted that the Gigafactory can allow Tesla to sell energy storage at 17% gross margins into 'a $2 trillion oil market and $400 million oil market'. Bernstein claims that considering the limitless long term opportunities at Tesla's disposal from this division, the company should shift its focus away from auto manufacture to only batteries. Tesla shares were down more than 2% in later trading hours.", "Noted cartoon fan Eddie Lacy has long been transformed into the Hulk in the artwork of football fans because of his wrecking-ball running style. Now the Green Bay Packers running back becomes the Hulk in a pair of videos promoting Samsung's Galaxy S6 smartphone and Gear VR and the movie \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron\" based on the Marvel Comics superheroes.\n\nOnce he's rolling u can't stop him #HulkMode #Hulk can't wait for this season #HulkSmash @Lil_Eazy_Ana_42 pic.twitter.com/zOf0xoVPnW -- swaggy_josbee(@josefue37324810)\n\nApril 4, 2015\n\nThe first video was released on Tuesday, and the second video was released on Thursday.\n\nIn a bit of foreshadowing, Lacy finds his briefcase invitation to join the virtual Avengers in a weight room while working out wearing a Hulk T-shirt. Via virtual reality, the former Alabama star gets to smash like the Hulk - even saying, \"Hulk smash\" -- and run through robots as though they were would-be tacklers in the NFL.\n\nAppearing with Lacy in the videos are soccer star Lionel Messi, surfer John John Florence, cyclist Fabian Cancellara and two \"lucky superfans,\" who have been identified as fourth-grader Bobby Martinez of Kansas City and Sasha Blanc, a mechanical engineer from Prague.\n\nLacy is preparing for his third NFL season. After winning the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2013, Lacy picked up where he left off in 2014. Despite suffering a concussion in the season-opening game, Lacy became the first player in Packers' history to rush for at least 1,000 yards and to score more than 10 touchdowns in each of his first two seasons. Lacy ran for 1,139 yards in 2014 after rushing for 1,178 in 2013. He scored 13 touchdowns this season after scoring 11 last year. Including the playoffs, Lacy produced 10 consecutive games with more than 100 yards from scrimmage. He became the first running back in Green Bay history to have at least 100 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown reception in three straight games.", "The LG G4 will have a QHD display, top-shelf camera, and an optional leather body. When it becomes available in May, the LG G4 will join the Samsung Galaxy S6, HTC One M9, and iPhone 6 as a flagship smart phone.\n\nOver the past few months, the field of top-tier Android phones has gotten considerably more crowded. In March Samsung announced the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge smart phones, which debuted to good reviews, and later that month HTC launched the One M9, its flagship handset. Not to be left out, this week LG officially announced the G4, its high-end smart phone for 2015.\n\nLG has been leaking details about the G4 for several weeks, but now it's official: the handset will have a 5.5-inch screen, a 16-megapixel camera sensor, and some fashion-conscious design choices such as an (optional) leather-encased body. The LG G4 will run Android 5.1 \"Lollipop,\" the latest version of the operating system, with a little bit of LG-specific software running on top.\n\nThe G4's camera is probably its strongest feature. The cameras found in Android smart phones are notorious for never being able to take pictures that are quite as good as those you'd get from an iPhone, even though they stack up on paper in terms of megapixels and sensor quality. But the G4 could change that reputation. Reviewers say the G4 takes very clear, sharp images even in low light, and with its default camera settings. LG's camera software allows the user to control shutter speed, ISO, and white balance, and the camera has automatic image stabilization and a special sensor to help it capture colors more accurately.\n\nLike last year's model, the LG G3, the G4 has its power and volume buttons located on the back of the phone's body, and its build is slightly curved, which LG says makes the display 20 percent less likely to break if the phone is dropped. The display has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, also known as \"QHD\" (Quad High Definition), and LG says it has the same color accuracy rating as the screens professional use to do color grading for movies.\n\nUnder the hood, the G4 has 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal storage (which can be expanded by adding a MicroSD card), and a zippy six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor. The phone's battery is removable, and LG says users can expect up to 14 hours of talk time, though of course the phone may not actually last that long in real life.\n\nThe G4 should be available on all the major US carriers, in the UK, and elsewhere, by the end of May. LG hasn't announced pricing yet, but the G4 will probably cost about the same as its predecessor, which went for $200 on contract when it launched in the US last summer.", "An important Android OS feature that's been missing from Samsung's latest flagship handset is expected to arrive with Android 5.1 for Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. There's no word as yet when this update will arrive, but according to a new report the Android 5.1 update for Galaxy S6 is going to bring Guest Mode to the new handsets. This feature was first introduced by Google for tablets with the Jelly Bean update, Lollipop brought it over for smartphones.\n\nGoogle brought Guest Mode to smartphones with Android 5.0 Lollipop but Samsung decided to remove this feature from Lollipop that was loaded on the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nNevertheless, it has been confirmed in a new report that both handsets are going to receive the Guest Mode feature in Android 5.1. The feature is said to work exactly as it does on any other Lollipop-powered smartphone.\n\nUsers will be able to create a separate account for people they want to provide controlled access to, that way all of their apps, data and files will remain inaccessible to the guest user who will have their own homescreen and no access to the areas closed off by the device owner.\n\nSamsung has not yet said when it will start rolling out Android 5.1 for Galaxy S6, so it could take some time before this feature arrives on the company's latest flagships.", "TOKYO - Once at the leading edge of consumer electronics, Sony (SNE) is now more lumbering giant than trend-setter after falling behind competitors such as Samsung Electronics and Apple (AAPL).\n\nSony watchers are urging the down-on-its-luck company to rediscover its pioneering ethos. Founded in 1946, Sony symbolized Japan's rebirth after its World War II defeat, rising from humble beginnings. It had little else besides the smarts of founders Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita, to come up with hit after hit: the transistor radio, home tape recorders, the Walkman portable recorder-and-player.\n\nIn a sign of its travails, the Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment conglomerate Thursday reported a net loss of 126 billion yen ($1.1 billion) for the fiscal year through March, almost as bad as the 128.4 billion yen loss it racked up the previous fiscal year. Annual sales rose nearly 6 percent to 8.2 trillion yen.\n\nSony is forecasting a return to profit at 140 billion yen ($1.2 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2016. It is seeking to rebuild its operations around its strengths. Here's what's ailing and promising in Sony's business areas:\n\nTelevisions\n\nBack in the 1960s, Sony dominated in TVs with its own technology called Trinitron, which boasted such a reputation for image quality it won an Emmy Award in 1973. But Sony underestimated the industry's switch to flat-panel TVs from CRT, or cathode-ray tubes. Sony has lost money in its TV business for the past decade. Samsung of South Korea leads with about a third of the global TV market share, followed by LG Electronics. Sony trails with under a tenth of the market.\n\nLast year, Sony split off the TV division as a wholly owned entity. And it's banking on 4K TV technology, or \"ultra-HD,\" with image quality superior to high-definition and each set costing as much as $25,000. The problem: Rivals are all working on the same.\n\n\"Sony management keeps saying the electronics market is shrinking. But that's a given. Sony in the past came up with products that created new product sectors,\" said Yasunori Tateishi, who has written a book on Sony's woes.\n\nImage sensors\n\nImage sensors are used in devices such as smartphones, digital cameras, medical devices and self-parking cars, and translate the information of a pictorial image into digital signals. Sony's sensor technology, known as CMOS, was years in the making and its development was expensive, causing the division to post years of losses. Sony might be finally ready to cash in on the investment. It's moving aggressively into high-end video cameras and SLR, or single-lens reflex, cameras, underpricing powerful Japanese rivals Nikon and Canon.\n\nSony's latest cameras can take smooth video of fast-moving objects and shoot video where there's almost no light. Although smartphones have eroded Sony's Cyber-shot digital camera business, the company is now wooing professional and upscale amateur photographers. Sony also acquired a 20 percent stake in medical equipment maker Olympus in 2012 to develop endoscopes and other surgical tools packed with Sony technology, such as three-dimensional imaging and 4K.\n\nKazunori Ito, analyst at Barclays in Tokyo, believes image sensors, along with games, can be counted on to be the new profit drivers for Sony, at a time when restructuring charges are winding down. The cameras are drawing new fans, including Havard Ferstad, a 34-year-old IT consultant and Tokyo resident, who has bought a 200,000 yen ($2,000) Sony camera. \"The thing is that Sony has high quality sensors in their still cameras, and they are giving it to consumers at a relatively low price,\" he said.\n\nGame machines\n\nThe first PlayStation video-game home console, which went on sale in Japan in 1994 and in the U.S. in 1995, has been a hit. With three successors already out, a fifth, or PS5, is almost certain. Sony has also delivered popular hand-held machines, starting with the PlayStation Portable, discontinued last year, and the PS Vita.\n\nSony has only two major rivals in the game-machine business: Nintendo and Microsoft (MSFT). The PlayStation 4 is at the top, and the PlayStation Network, which has more than 100 million registered accounts worldwide, carries content and services, including games, streaming video, TV shows and chats. The game-networking platform will extend to more devices, such as TVs and tablets. In the U.S., Sony recently entered the pay-TV business with an online package of more than 50 channels starting at $50 a month, called PlayStation Vue, for PlayStation owners in three cities.\n\n\"That's the power of the PlayStation brand, a brand that has been cultivated over the course of 20 years as the core gamers' system,\" said Jeffrey Wilson, senior analyst with PCMag.com, who points to \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Metal Gear Solid 4\" as strong exclusives. \"Right now, Sony needs to give gamers what they signed up for when they purchased a PS4 - a string of good games.\"\n\nEntertainment\n\nIn 1995, Sony acquired Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion, which was widely criticized as overpriced. Norio Ohga, president at that time, was a former opera singer and musical connoisseur, with a vision to make Sony an entertainment company. Whenever Sony had a hit movie, such as the \"Spider-Man\" series, or a popular musical release from artists like Beyonce and Daft Punk, that helped offset its losses in the electronics business.\n\nBut striking the right balance between electronics and entertainment has been difficult. In 2009, Howard Stringer, then Sony chief, scoffed at a reporter's question about whether Sony planned to produce material by Michael Jackson, a Sony artist who died that year, using 3-D technology. Sony later reversed course and produced 3-D versions of Jackson's music videos, including the post-mortem \"This Is It.\"\n\nRecently, Sony Pictures suffered from a hacking attack over its movie called \"The Interview,\" which spoofs an assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The film was released in independent theaters and through Internet outlets in December.\n\n\"Those interested in cinema and who watch Sony's films are primarily judging the company by the quality of the films they produce and release, so whether they sell electronics is not really on their minds,\" said Maggie Lee, a film critic for Variety. Lee said the hacking woes actually drew more interest in \"The Interview,\" and she also had praise for \"Coming Home,\" directed by Zhang Yimou and Sono Sion's \"Shinjuku Swan\" as strong recent offerings.\n\nRobots\n\nThe Aibo entertainment robot, on which Sony pulled the plug in 2006 under a plan to cut costs, was a perfect example of the \"synergy\" that has been an elusive goal for decades, creatively bringing together two areas of Sony's expertise: entertainment and gadgetry. The mechanical pets, costing about $2,000 each, were programmed with a disarming \"personality,\" drawing fiercely loyal fans. Never mind only 150,000 of the toy-poodle-sized toys were ever sold. They boosted Sony's image as an innovator that was more than about just money-making. Stringer's decision to kill Aibo set off an uproar from owners.\n\n\"Sony became too Americanized. It used to be a different kind of company,\" said Nobuyuki Norimatsu, nicknamed \"Aibo doctor,\" of A-Fun, a company of engineers who do repairs for discontinued electronics goods. Last year, Sony ended maintenance services for Aibo. Norimatsu has a Buddhist priest chant prayers for the robotic spirits before taking an Aibo apart.

Year-on-year, Sony's revenue increased by 5.8 percent to \u00a58.2 trillion.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sony's Mobile Communications unit, which develops the Xperia smartphones, gets part of the blame for another year in the red.\n\nThe future of the mobile division has been in question since a new head of Sony Mobile Communications was appointed in October last year. Sony announced layoffs and pulled the plug on the PlayStation Mobile platform but hasn't been able to turn around its fortunes.\n\nDuring Sony's fourth quarter, running from January to March, revenue was flat, but the number of phones it sold dropped.\n\nFaced with Apple and Samsung's domination of the high end and competition from new and old Chinese vendors at the low end, Sony and other companies such as HTC are struggling to get people to buy their phones. Sony was the 10th largest phone maker in 2014 with a 2 percent market share, according to Gartner.\n\nWhile Sony expects all other segments to make an operating profit during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, Mobile Communications will still record a loss, the company said.\n\nIf Sony wants to turn around its smartphone fortunes, it needs to break the mold a bit more,and give away more of its content, including movies, said Nick Spencer, senior practice director at ABI Research, in a recent interview.\n\nBut it seems the company has already planned for a different future. In February, Sony announced its latest turnaround plan that will see increased spending on the games and network services division, hoping to attract more gamers to the PlayStation and its PlayStation Network.\n\nAlong with music and movies, the company is also betting on the unit that makes image sensors for smartphones. The sensors will get more funding, to be spent on research and increased production.\n\nThe company's goal is \u00a5500 billion in operating profit for its fiscal year to March 31, 2018. In the short term, the goal is to turn around to a \u00a5140 billion profit in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 from a net loss of \u00a5126 billion in the previous year.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com", "MUMBAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Indian smartphone maker Micromax Informatics Ltd (IPO-MINF.NS) is looking to raise capital from private investors or through a stock market listing, as it expands into new business segments including personal computing, its co-founder said.\n\nMicromax, backed by private equity firms including Sequoia Capital and TA Associates, has held discussions with a group of investors led by Japanese mobile telecom firm SoftBank Corp , Reuters reported last month.\n\nThose talks were about the sale of a 20 percent for up to $1 billion, two people had said, which values the Indian firm at around $5 billion.\n\nVikas Jain declined to confirm any ongoing talks but said the company was also open to the option of an initial public offering of shares possibly on a local stock exchange.\n\n\"As we talk, both the options remain open.

Samsung will utilise the two new models to combat Apple as well as to help recover current declining profits heading into the next quarter.\n\nApple continued to find success with larger screened iPhones, which produced its strongest second quarter ever with 61.2 million units shipped.\n\nMuch of the success this quarter came out of Greater China as rapid 4G adoption, Apple retail expansion, and an increased appetite for premium devices elevated the brand to new levels.\n\nOverall, the iPhone grew 40 percent year over year and a remarkable 63 percent in emerging markets.\n\nLenovo is once again in the top three, proving that its Motorola acquisition is paying off nicely.\n\nLenovo has strategically positioned both brands and the coinciding models in the proper markets to maximise brand awareness and global reach. Lenovo also unveiled new premium-built handsets at CES with the P90, Vibe X2 pro, and Vibe Shot proving that it is not just focused on the low-end.\n\nHuawei remained in the number four position with a continued push on premium devices from its P-Series and Honor portfolios.\n\nHuawei's mid-range and high-end models accounted for a third of its smartphone shipments in the first quarter, up from just 5 percent a year ago. Huawei's Y-series sold briskly both inside and outside of China as a valuable low-cost option in many markets.\n\nLG regained the number five spot worldwide from Xiaomi as it once again bet big on entry-level 4G enabled devices as well as focusing on the mid-tier in North America.\n\nIts L-series and F-series portfolio succeeded in both emerging and developed markets. LG also shipped the innovative curved G Flex 2, which it showed off at CES earlier in the year. LG's diverse portfolio, with models ranging in prices, features, and design, enabled the brand to overtake Xiaomi's more limited geographic presence to hit the top five.\n\nJoin the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

The company's GAAP revenues declined 1% due to currency-related headwinds. However, its core sales improved 4%, to reach $2.43 billion, driven by growth at its Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments. Corning Corning's Display Technologies and Environmental Technologies segments were also in the positive. Its Life Sciences segment reported a decline in core sales as a result of foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nCorning's core earnings increased 14%, to $484 million, driving a 21% increase in core earnings per share, to reach $0.35. The market was expecting earnings per share of $0.34. Despite the earnings beat, Corning's stock declined 1.4% through the day, as investors did not welcome the prospects of lower revenue growth in the future due to currency headwinds.\n\nSee our complete analysis of Corning here\n\nOptical Communications Drives Top Line Growth\n\nThe growing video content on websites and increased usage of cloud-based services has been driving internet traffic. The proliferation of smartphones and tablets has also added to the internet traffic by enabling easy access. In order to cater to the increased traffic, service providers have been forced to upgrade their networks from copper wire to optical fiber-based networks. This helped drive Optical Communications' first quarter revenue by 18%, to reach $697 million. The segment's net income and revenue also benefited from the integration of TR Manufacturing, a provider of fiber-optic and copper cable interconnects and electro-mechanical assemblies to original equipment manufacturers, which Corning had acquired earlier in January.\n\nGoing forward, we expect to see continued growth in Corning's Optical Communications segment driven by the consolidation of TR Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics Samsung Electronics' fiber optics business. Corning acquired Samsung Electronics' fiber optics business on March 31. The acquisition led to the integration of Samsung's fiber optic manufacturing facilities in South Korea and China into Corning's Optical Communications division. The segment will also benefit from growth in internet traffic, which should drive demand for optical fiber. Cisco forecasts that the global network traffic will grow at an average rate of 23% every year through 2018. Specialty Materials Grows On Gorilla Glass 4\n\nCorning's Gorilla Glass volumes were up 20% in the first quarter. We believe that the demand for Corning's latest version of cover glass, Gorilla Glass 4, helped drive the growth in volumes. Most recently, Gorilla Glass 4 was featured on the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which were launched on April 10. Samsung placed orders for 13 million units of the smartphones, which must have had a significant impact on Gorilla Glass 4 volumes, particularly because Gorilla Glass 4 has been used on both sides of the S6 and S6 Edge. We expect to see the same trend drive growth in the next quarter.\n\nIn the past year, Gorilla Glass pricing had taken a beating. However, pricing improved slightly in the first quarter driven by Gorilla Glass 4 as Corning charged a premium for Gorilla Glass 4's features. Corning earlier claimed that Gorilla Glass 4 had the best drop performance in the industry.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "Samsung's Galaxy S6 is a great device, no doubt about it. It has all the elements needed for a great smartphone: a large, high quality display, powerful processor, a great operating system with countless features, and two amazing cameras.\n\nHowever, the competition out there is merciless. Apple has hit the South Korean giants hard with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, and now the LG G4 seems to be out for blood, as well.\n\nThe G4 hasn't even been properly unveiled yet, and Forbes has already made a detailed comparison of the cameras on the two smartphone heavyweights, and even though LG has some hardware advantages over the Galaxy S6, the question remains whether or not is it worth extra $$$.\n\n\"One aspect of which the company is most proud is the G4's main lens. Its f/1.8 aperture is currently the brightest on any smartphone and is a massive improvement on the f/2.4 lens found on the current G3 model. Perhaps more importantly it just pips Samsung's excellent f/1.9 Galaxy S6 camera at the post\", says Forbes, later adding that the 0.1 difference might not be \"incredibly important\", as LG likes to put it.\n\nManual control over shutter speed, ISO and white balance are also big advantages for the G4.\n\nStill, the automatic snapshots are what will ultimately determine the better camera for most owners. Both Apple and Samsung are extremely good at that, and we will still have to wait and see just how LG's flagship G4 can compete with the duo.\n\nStartup time, handling of the phone while taking pictures, megapixels; those are all elements making the difference between a good camera and a great camera.\n\n\"These early details look very promising, but the Galaxy S6 is a very tough act to follow and it will definitely take more than just an f/1.8 lens to pull it off\", Forbes concludes.", "By making the app store for its own OS available nearly everywhere, the electronics giant may be trying to tempt more developers into creating apps for the platform.\n\nThe app store for Samsung's Tizen, its alternative mobile operating system, has expanded from just two countries to 182 -- including the US, the UK and China.\n\nThe South Korean electronics giant confirmed the big jump in a statement to The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.\n\nThe application marketplace was previously available in India and Bangladesh, but is now also operating in such places as Australia, Canada, Japan and Mexico, according to a list published by Tizen-focused site Tizen Experts. For now, only free apps are listed in the marketplaces in the new countries.\n\nBy making the Tizen Store available globally, Samsung could be trying to tempt more developers into making apps for the platform. While Tizen has attracted some prominent developers to build titles for its platform, including game maker Electronic Arts, the Tizen marketplace is an afterthought for most developers. Google's Android and Apple's iOS mobile operating systems are where the vast majority of users are. Cash-strapped developers trying to get their apps to go as far as possible benefit the most from developing apps for those platforms. It's an issue that other second-tier operating systems, like Windows Phone and BlackBerry, deal with as well.\n\nTizen was initially designed to be Samsung's answer to the two dominant forces in mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. However, after a string of delays and setbacks, Samsung decided that it would offer Tizen as an alternative to customers in emerging markets who were seeking low-cost smartphones.\n\nEarlier this year, Samsung finally launched its Tizen-powered smartphone, the Z1, in India and Bangladesh. The device is available for under $100 off-contract, making it affordable for customers who want to jump into the smartphone market but don't have the cash to buy a higher-end alternative running Android or iOS.\n\nTizen has also made its way to other Samsung products, including the company's wearables. A handful of wearables, including the Samsung Gear S and the Gear 2, are running on Tizen. Samsung said in January that Tizen will run on all of the company's smart televisions in 2015.\n\nNow that the Tizen Store is available worldwide, Samsung could be positioning the marketplace for more usage and thus, attract more popular apps. Having more devices running on Tizen, including the smart TVs, could help its efforts in that area.\n\nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Tizen Store expansion.", "The company lost 126 billion yen ($1.05 billion) in the fiscal year ended in March, but it expects to turn that around with a 140 billion yen profit next fiscal year.\n\nSony might have posted a loss for the fiscal year ended in March, but the company says that the future looks much brighter.\n\nSony said (PDF) on Thursday that it expects to post a profit in the fiscal year ended March 2016 of 140 billion yen ($1.2 billion), more than making up for the loss of 126 billion yen the company suffered for the fiscal year ended in March. That profit would be the first the company would tally since the fiscal year ended in 2013 and its biggest profit in seven years. It would also mark an important turnaround for a company that has been facing its fair share of troubles over the last couple of years.\n\nLooking even further ahead, the company is predicting a $4.2 billion profit by the end of its 2017 fiscal year, ending in March 2018.\n\nSo how do they aim to do that?\n\nAlthough Sony has been able to turn its gaming division around and focus its efforts in other areas, mobile continues to be a source of trouble as consumers opt for devices from Samsung, Apple, and countless China-based handset makers, like Xiaomi and Huawei. In February, Sony acknowledged its woes in mobile, saying that the \"challenging competitive landscapes\" in that market has forced it to rethink its strategy. Over the next several years, Sony will focus on only a few territories to sell its products. The company also hasn't ruled out selling its mobile division.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony has experienced issues in other areas, forcing it to shed its television division and get out of the PC business. It plans to also offload its audio and video segments and says it will continue to get rid of more business segments that are proving to be a drag on its financials.\n\nThose efforts are part of a broader strategy, announced in February, that will focus the conglomerate on four core businesses: the PlayStation gaming division, its film studio Sony Pictures, Sony Music, and the devices business that includes sensors and other components bundled into popular smartphones and tablets. Sony said at the time that it would invest heavily in those areas and reduce its spending on other, under-performing segments.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony's latest forecast seems to follow the company's logic on growth. Sony's Devices business will see its operating income jump by 32 billion yen year-over-year in the 2015 fiscal year ended March 2016. Sony Pictures and Sony Music will also generate a higher operating profit. Sony's gaming business, however, is expected to be down.\n\nSony was once a dominant force in the tech space. Many of its products, including televisions, gaming products and devices like the Walkman music player, established the company as a leader and helped it achieve billions of dollars in profits in the 1990s and early 2000s. By the start of this decade, however, the company's business started on a steep decline as the PlayStation 3 initially failed to gain traction, the Walkman was a distant memory, and everything from digital cameras to mobile devices were getting hit hard by competitors.\n\nSony's troubles in mobile have been a thorn in CEO Kazuo Hirai's side. In October, the company tried to shake up the division by appointing a new executive. The effort, which proved to be fruitless, came after Sony slashed its full-year smartphone sales forecast from 50 million units to 43 million. To put that into perspective, Apple sold over 61 million iPhones in its last-reported quarter, alone.\n\nInterestingly, Sony's mobile business, which has been a source of trouble for company, will contribute heavily to the company's success this fiscal year. The company expects its operating loss in that division to fall from 217.6 billion yen to 39 billion yen. However, the reduction will be due to a decline in costs related to the restructuring of Sony's business and not necessarily greater demand for its products. Indeed, the company says it expects fewer sales this fiscal year.\n\nAlthough all eyes are on Sony's future, its past year wasn't nearly as troubling as some of its recent years. The company reported on Thursday that revenue was up 5.8 percent to 8.2 trillion yen. Sony was also able to reduce its losses a bit from 128.4 billion yen in the prior year to 126 billion yen for the year ended March 31. According to Sony, its gains in the past year was built atop the \"strong performance of PlayStation 4\" and the popularity of its image sensors in mobile products. Still, shareholders don't seem all that pleased with Sony's performance and forecast for next year. The company's shares are down 68 cents, or about 2 percent, to $30.02 in early trading on Thursday.", "At Wednesday's press conference, Hall of Fame promoter Bob Arum hinted about a new mystery sponsor for Manny Pacquiao.

TENAA has certainly proved to be a reliable source of information in the past, as you would expect from the country's official certification authority.\n\nNonetheless, you'd be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at some of the specs outlined for the Nubia Z9.

Happily the activity hasn't been restricted to the hardware side of things either; more much-needed 4K content has crept onto the scene too. So let's have a look through some of the highlights.\n\nNew 4K TVs roll in\n\nWhile almost all the main TV brands have now missed the TV target launch dates they announced at the CES in January, a few more new 4K UHD TVs have trickled in over the past few weeks.\n\nSamsung has accounted for the lion's share of these. First it added the JS9000 series to its 'SUHD' range, which deliver high dynamic range playback as well as a UHD resolution. Joining the previously reviewed UN65JS9500 (UE65JS9500 in Europe), the JS9000 SUHD series offers a cheaper SUHD option by using edge LED lighting rather than the direct LED lighting used in the JS9500s.\n\nSamsung's JS9000 SUHD TVs offer both HDR and UHD playback.\n\nThe Forbes review of the UN65JS9000 concluded that \"a sensibly set-up UN65JS9000 is simply as good as edge-lit LCD TVs currently get\" - though it added that if you can afford the extra $1000 needed for the UN65JS9500 you should spend it, as the flagship model does offer a significant step-up in performance.\n\nLess bright but cheaper SUHD models have also emerged in the shape of the curved JS8500 series and a 65-inch flat JS850 model, while if you're willing to give up the high brightness and HDR playback of the SUHD models Samsung now also offers curved JU7500 and flat JU7100 4K UHD models. Look out for reviews of these more affordable new Samsung models soon.\n\nThe other significant 4K TV arrival is the first of LG's 4K OLED TVs. After endless delays apparently caused by continuing issues producing large OLD panels in sufficient numbers, the $12,000 65EC9700 is finally fairly widely available. In fact, there's one on my test bench as we speak, which I'll be reviewing for Forbes in the next few days.\n\nThis isn't the only 4K LG OLED TV in town either: the brand has also managed to introduce its more affordable EG9600 series, available in 55-inch and 65-inch versions, costing 'just' $5,500 and $9000 respectively.\n\nHere's hoping that by the time the next 4K UHD TV Digest comes around Sony Sony and Panasonic Panasonic might finally have got some of their new 4K TVs on sale too.\n\nSony Adds HDR To New 4K TVs\n\nIn other 4K TV news this month, Sony announced that some of its imminent 4K TVs will support High Dynamic Range playback. Sony had previously suggested both at the CES and a UK product event that HDR would only be implemented on all-new ranges of TVs due to be launched in the final quarter, but now, as recently reported by Forbes, the X930C and X940C ranges, expected in May, will both receive firmware upgrades in the summer that will make them capable of playing HDR sources.\n\nSony's X930C 4K TV.\n\nI can't help but wonder if the LCD panels inside the X930C and X940C models are really capable of doing HDR content justice given that the feature appears to be a last-minute addition, but hopefully I'll be impressed when the TVs arrive for testing.\n\nWorld's First 4K TV Channel Goes Live\n\nWith live TV viewing still making up around 90% of TV content consumption, for 4K to go truly mainstream it's going to need to be supported by a few TV channels.

If the G4 is the greatest phone ever, why not use the top of the range processor?\n\nQualcomm also points out that Samsung went in-house for the processor in the Galaxy S6 rather than using the Snapdragon 810.\n\nExamining the detail, however, you soon discover that LG isn't claiming that the G4 is the flagship. It majors on having a fast f/1.8 lens, great battery life, a new user interface and a leather back. LG doesn't claim that the G4 is the fastest phone yet. And the LG Flex 2 does use the Snapdragon 810.\n\nQualcomm's chip pricing has always been shrouded in secrecy. It works hard to make sure that rival customers don't know what the other is paying. It is however to be expected that LG will be paying less for the 808 than the 810.\n\nWhat no manufacturer ever says is \"it's engineered down to a price\", however true that might be, so instead LG's Dr Ramchan Woo, head of smartphone planning, said: \"Our objective with LG G4 was to create a smartphone with the optimal balance of performance, functionality, efficiency and design innovation.\"\n\n\"By working closely with Qualcomm Technologies on the LG G4 smartphone,\" Dr Woo continued, \"we were able to deliver on this high bar of innovation that both companies set.\"\n\nBoth Qualcomm and LG talk a lot about battery life. In practice the 808 has a very similar processor architecture. It runs at a slower clock speed which will help both battery life and reduce heat, and the graphics processor is downgraded a little on the 808.\n\nHow useful the extra power is on the 810 depends on the application. If a game is driving all four cores hard you'll see a difference, particularly over short periods of time because when the chip heats up, that will cut the clock speed. In a long gaming session an 808 may start slower but overtake an 810 as the 810 gets cut by heat - and then see the 808 slow as that too gets hot. This is familiar territory for all processors.\n\nA Qualcomm spokesman refused to comment to The Register, telling us \"all decisions on the components of a handset are down to the individual OEM.\"\n\nSo what Qualcomm isn't saying is that the 808 was chosen on price, and what LG isn't saying is that there will be another handset, above the G4 which will have a Snapdragon 810.

With a dramatic shift in build material and quality, significant changes in hardware, and a far improved software experience, Samsung has finally delivered what many were looking for in the Galaxy S6.\n\nOf course, Samsung is known for pushing its boundaries, and this came in the form of the Galaxy S6 Edge, bringing forward a concept seen last year in the Galaxy Note Edge, and introducing it to the mainstream. With the release of two worthy flagship smartphones from the company, the obvious question that will be on your mind is with regards to which one is better suited to you. That is what we attempt to answer, as we take an in-depth look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 Edge!\n\nOn the design front, there is basically just one differentiating factor between these two devices, namely the curves on either side of the screen in the case of the Galaxy S6 Edge. Both devices do retain the tried and true design language of previous Samsung devices though, complete with the same tactile home button up front and standard placements for the volume rocker and power button.\n\nThe similarities continue on the back, as both devices sport a protruding camera module that is accompanied by a heart rate monitor. Both devices also have glass back panels, which eliminates the ability to remove the back cover and additional hardware features that they entailed. The Galaxy S6 is a tad taller and only a few grams heavier that the Edge variant, a difference that is largely negligible.\n\nWhen it comes to design, what makes the case for the Galaxy S6 Edge is indeed its slopes on the right and left portions of the screen, a significant difference that might have to felt to be believed. The inclusion of two edges started to make sense after holding the device. The fact that they come down to meet the palm allows for a side to side handling experience that is perhaps better than what you would get with the slab form factor of almost every other smartphone out there.\n\nGrip and accidentally turning on the display are mild concerns when it comes to the Edge variant. But when holding on to the phone, a very prominent lip is present in the metal frame that tilts down very slightly, and mainly sticks out from behind the screen. So with a good pinch, there aren't a lot of problems with keeping the phone in check without triggering the screen accidentally. However, the same cannot be said when holding the phone in the landscape orientation, as I did find it a little tough to hold the device on the edges without some fidgeting.\n\nThe width of the devices is pretty much the same, but with the screen coming down on either end, the Galaxy S6 Edge actually feels more narrow, and that makes a lot of difference. Aesthetically as well, the S6 Edge is the one that will definitely turn heads. While the original looks like a mashup of the Galaxy and Xperia lines due to its dual glass panels, the Edge version will be instantly recognizable to the tech-savvy, and given Samsung's big marketing push, likely to the common consumer soon enough. If handling is a big deal to you, the S6 Edge offers an experience that has to be felt, and its uniqueness is something that will certainly stay with you.\n\nThe sentiments on the design side of things hold true when it comes to the display, with the curves of the Galaxy S6 adding to the overall viewing experience as well. First, on the specifications front, both devices offer nothing short of what you would expect from a Samsung flagship, with their 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screens featuring a Quad HD resolution, resulting in the super high pixel density of 577 ppi. Both displays are vivid, colorful, and sharp, and don't miss a beat in work, play, or media consumption.\n\nWhat makes the Galaxy S6 Edge so compelling is the fact that its screen is essentially one entity, and doesn't have a specific area sectioned off for the edge capabilities, as was the case with the Galaxy Note Edge. We will explore the features of the edge in the software section below, but worth a mention is that they only take up one side of the display, and further, only appear when specifically triggered. It does feel like Samsung has finally figured out that the edges aren't made for supposedly game changing features, but rather to offer literally a new way of looking at a device.\n\nAs such, elements of the Android 5.0 Lollipop Material Design are also given an auxiliary benefit, with a roll-in effect of various UI elements that may not always be noticed, but are certainly appreciated every time it is. As an example, watching media in the landscape orientation makes the heads up notifications look even better because of this effect. The edges don't move any of the frame away from your viewpoint, and once again, are mostly there more for aesthetics and convenience, with a few features that for the most part, stay out of the way.\n\nAnother big change with their latest flagships was Samsung's decision to give the Snapdragons of the world a skip in favor of its in-house Exynos processor, something that looks to have worked to great effect. Under the hood, both phones pack the octa-core Exynos 7420 processor, backed by the Mali-T760 MP8 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. It is also worth mentioning that the built-in storage benefits from a UFS 2.0 flash memory construction that helps keep things super speedy and optimized, a case that has been made against expandable storage, that just won't be able to keep with installed memory. It's also packing LPDDR4 RAM, which represents a huge leap forward in memory performance for mobile devices\n\nBoth these devices race through the elements of the dialed-back TouchWiz interface, with virtually every stutter and hiccup from the past now eliminated. The only real stutter that we've ever seen involves the Flipboard-powered Briefing screen, which has to refresh every time you swipe to it, slowing down an immediate return to the homescreens as a result.\n\nAll other tasks are handled extremely well, even if you're trying to perform them at the same time using Multi-Window or the S Window capabilities. Almost no problems were seen with gaming as well, though the phone does get quite warm, but not uncomfortably so, while running the more processor intensive applications. The edge screen panels don't down the Galaxy S6 Edge either, so its speed doesn't get hindered because of its slightly higher feature set. As such, performance is one aspect where things are very much a tie, and is a non-factor for anyone confused between these two devices.\n\nThe big story since the announcement of these devices has been the lack of replaceable batteries and expandable storage, that have been otherwise staple features of the Samsung line. These phones do pack more than most when it comes to hardware though, including a better implementation of the fingerprint scanner embedded into the home button, and the now vertical heart rate monitor that, in our testing, worked a little faster than previous editions found on Samsung devices.\n\nConnectivity with the LTE networks has been very steady on either device, and the quality of voice calls are as good as they've ever been. The sound coming from the speaker in its new position at the bottom gets adequately loud, no matter which iteration of the phone you get.\n\nBattery life on either device is pretty standard, despite the higher resolution displays. Of course, we come back again to the primary difference between the two smartphones, the edges. There are no real hardware capabilities that put the edge over the top in this regard, though the different form factor does mean different third party accessories.\n\nAs you may have seen, or can check out below, in the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge camera shootout, it has to be said the camera package Samsung has put out this year is definitely among the best. A rear-facing 16 MP camera with a f/1.9 aperture adds auto-HDR to a laundry list of capabilities, with the front-facing 5 MP unit sporting the same as well.\n\nThe camera application comes with a variety of modes, including panorama and slow motion video capture at 120 fps, and can easily be activated by a double tap of the home button, which is one of the best felt enhancements with the latest Galaxy offerings.\n\nUsing these cameras in all but the lowest light in indoor situations yields some really great looking photos, and with an auto mode that performs extremely well, most of the guesswork is taken out of the smartphone photography experience. Extra features, and a manual Pro mode, are available to those who want it, but for the general user who just wants to capture memories, both of these devices are great companions to have.\n\nTo some extent, smartphone cameras were struggling to get to the point of replacing even typical point and shoot devices, but things are closer than they've ever been with the current crop of flagship smartphones, and the possibilities offered by the latest additions to the Galaxy S line are prime examples of that evolution.\n\nAs has been mentioned a few times already, the latest iteration of the TouchWiz software experience available with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge has been toned down considerably, to the pleasure of many. Not only has a lot of gimmicky aspects been put aside, but those that are still available aren't very prominent in their presence. Even the pop-up tutorials about how to use the different features are largely absent, and turning off features like S Voice is very easy to do this time around. The user interface still features a pretty colorful aesthetic, but the available theme engine can be used to change the look to anything that better suits your tastes.\n\nWith the software experience also mostly the same between both devices, it's better to take a look at what makes the Galaxy S6 Edge different, and what features and capabilities the edge panels offer. First, these panels and features don't show up until triggered, which happens only from a standby position via a few swipes on the side that are pre-determined by the user.\n\nThe night clock comes up, and then you can swipe from the bottom portion to see notifications, news tickers, and a number of other edge panels that can be installed from the Settings menu. Despite some usefulness to the news tickers, the scrolling generally focuses on one story at a time, and thus pales in comparison to using even the Briefing screen instead. It can also be a good way of looking at notifications quickly, but waking the phone up and seeing them on the lockscreen is arguably still faster.\n\nFinally, there is the People Edge, which houses five of your favorite contacts with specific colors assigned to them for easy access to calls and messages. While its functionality as a speed dial was great, the main gripe I had with it was the messages required the use of the native messaging app, instead of something else that you may already be comfortable with using, such as Hangouts. While the phone is upside down, the color assigned to the contact will glow on the side to let you know exactly who is calling in a very interesting way. That said, there aren't a lot of situations where you will have your phone screen placed down on a table, and it honestly does look like the underside of an import tuner car.\n\nOverall, the main takeaway from the software side of things is how much better the Samsung TouchWiz UI has gotten, helped by how optimized it is with the company's own processing packages. The edge features are there for those who specifically need them, but all said and done, there might not be a whole lot of people who do.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing the price points is when you realize that wanting the sloped edges requires a premium over the already not particularly cheap Galaxy S6. The Galaxy S6 Edge costs about $150 more overall for the unlocked version, and will result in higher monthly payments on various network carriers. For example, The S6 Edge will cost $10 per month on the Simple Choice monthly plan from T-Mobile.", "We told you guys about Samsung's newest line of affordable tablets -- the Samsung Galaxy Tab A -- back when they went up for pre-order last week.

Year-on-year, Sony's revenue increased by 5.8 percent to \u00a58.2 trillion.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sony's Mobile Communications unit, which develops the Xperia smartphones, gets part of the blame for another year in the red.\n\nThe future of the mobile division has been very much up in question since a new head of Sony Mobile Communications was appointed in October last year. Sony has announced layoffs and pulled the plug on the PlayStation Mobile platform, but hasn't been able to turn around its fortunes.\n\nDuring Sony's fourth quarter, running from January to March, revenue was flat, but the number of phones it sold dropped.\n\nFaced with Apple and Samsung's domination of the high end and competition from new and old Chinese vendors at the low end, Sony and other companies such as HTC are struggling to get people to buy their phones. Sony was the tenth largest phone maker in 2014 with a 2 percent market share, according to Gartner.\n\nWhile Sony expects all other segments to make an operating profit during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, Mobile Communications will still record a loss, the company said. If Sony wants to turn around its smartphone fortunes, it needs to break the mold a bit more, and give away more of its content, including movies, Nick Spencer, senior practice director at ABI Research, said in a recent interview.\n\nBut it seems the company has already planned for a different future. In February, Sony announced its latest turnaround plan that will see increased spending on the games and network services division, hoping to attract more gamers to the PlayStation and its PlayStation Network.\n\nAlong with music and movies, the company is also betting on the unit that makes image sensors for smartphones. The sensors will get more funding, to be spent on research and increased production.\n\nThe company's goal is \u00a5500 billion in operating profit for its fiscal year to March 31, 2018. In the short term, the goal is to turn around to a \u00a5140 billion profit in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 from a net loss of \u00a5126 billion in the previous year.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\n2015 State of The IT Channel Survey : IT'S TIME!!!

The release date is set to May 12, but LG hasn't said anything about a different smaller version of its G4 flagship.

But for the time being, we don't really known how much lower the specs are going to go.\n\nOther device manufacturers have been following this path.

It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.", "In this shocking video a man baits dogs to attack a defenceless sheep.\n\nThree dogs can be seen terrorising the farm animal in a field in Barrow, Cumbria on New Year's Day last year, dragging it down every time it tries to struggle free.\n\nDean Quirk, 26, of Barrow, admitted baiting a dog after performing a last-minute u-turn and changing his plea to guilty at Furness Magistrates Court on Wednesday.\n\nHe will be sentenced on May 6.\n\nQuirk's crime was only discovered after a police raid on the home of Andrew Fenton on March 19 last year.\n\nAfter seizing a camera, a Samsung table and mobile phone at Fenton's property, police discovered the video and began proceedings against Quirk.\n\nFenton, 29, was jailed for 26 weeks last November for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal by also baiting dogs to target sheep.\n\nHe was also guilty of failing to remove his dog Kenya from the sheep after the attack.\n\nInsp Will Lamping said: 'It was as a result of the case involving Fenton that led us to Mr Quirk and him being identified as the other person on the video footage after appeals and a lot of man hours.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- The iPhone is still the engine behind Apple's phenomenal success, even if attention lately has been focused on its new smartwatch.\n\nWhile skeptics question whether the company's future is tied too much to one product, the iPhone's popularity was the reason Apple turned in another blow-out financial report Monday. The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak.\n\nApple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the three-month period and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit.\n\nAs expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers bought a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But the 61 million was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014.\n\n\"We're seeing great results all over the world,\" Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion.\n\nOther products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion -- continuing a steady decline in tablet sales.\n\nApple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month after the quarter ended. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on a conference call that he was \"thrilled\" with customer response, but added that it's difficult to gauge demand because initial supplies are limited. Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions.\n\nThe iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week.\n\nAs iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising another 1 percent in extended trading.\n\nThe iPhone isn't just Apple's dominant product, said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. \"It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.\"\n\nMarket researchers, however, expect smartphone growth to slow down worldwide this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in industrialized countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace.\n\n\"They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,\" said investment analyst Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. \"At some point, the market dynamics change,\" he said, adding that the question is what could replace the iPhone if sales begin to slow.\n\nCook said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi by appealing to a growing middle class. He also said only 20 percent of iPhone owners have purchased the newest models, which he painted as a sign that many more will eventually upgrade to the 6 or 6 Plus.\n\nMaestri, meanwhile, said the company is diversifying with new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, which on Monday added Discover to the list of payment cards that work with the service. While he acknowledged these currently provide minimal revenue to Apple, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.\n\nApple also announced Monday an expansion of its 2-year-old effort to give investors a bigger share of the company's huge profits. Maestri said Apple will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. In total, he said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017.\n\nApple ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash and short-term securities. But since most of that is parked overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. tax rates, Maestri said Apple will likely take advantage of low interest rates to borrow money for the program.", "A crowdfunding campaign for a sleek modular smartphone concept has been unceremoniously dumped by IndieGoGo, which shuttered the project's page on Friday morning.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign for a sleek modular smartphone concept has been unceremoniously dumped by IndieGoGo, which shuttered the project's page on Friday morning.\n\nAs first reported by ModularAndroid.com, the project page was taken down and all pledges were refunded.

Moreover, the Fonkraft design looked a lot more like a traditional smartphone than Project Ara, with its more blocky, Lego-like appearance.\n\nJoin the Computerworld newsletter!

TSLA -0.01 % makes a bid to dominate the budding market for electricity storage, it faces lots of competitors and rival technologies, energy experts say. And plenty of challenges -- including driving down the price of its \"power walls\" to a level that will prompt price-sensitive consumers to spring for them.\n\nTesla announced Thursday that it is repackaging the lithium ion batteries it now uses in its electric cars to sell them as electricity-storage devices for homes, businesses and utilities. The battery packs are meant to absorb electricity when it is cheap and plentiful -- during a sunny afternoon for a house with rooftop solar panels, for example -- and release the power when electricity is expensive or scarce.\n\nMore\n\nHeard on the Street: Tesla's Battery Could Power Utilities Tesla Launches Used Car Sales Via Web\n\nSo far the market for electricity storage remains small, though growing quickly; last year about $128 million worth of such batteries were installed around the country, mostly at utilities, according to GTM Research, which tracks the renewable energy industry. Just 1% of the capacity was installed at homes.\n\nTesla plans to change all that. At an event to formally announce the battery products, Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, said it is \"trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world.\" The company's shares, which had risen by about 6% in the days before the party, ended Friday almost unchanged at $225.96, down nine cents.\n\nA few companies, including Sungevity and Sunrun Inc., plan to offer battery systems for consumers who have solar panels, at prices they say will be competitive with Tesla's. For bigger users, companies including Sunverge Energy Inc., Stem Inc. and Greencharge Networks offer lithium-ion batteries made by companies like LG Chem 051910 -1.09 % and Samsung, 005930 1.81 % with various financing options. Another group of companies sells what are known as flow batteries, which are more common for very large users like utilities.\n\n\"So many companies are fighting over a market that's practically nonexistent right now,\" said Haresh Kamath, energy storage expert at the Electric Power Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. \"Tesla is betting they can produce a charismatic product that consumers will want to buy -- like what Apple did with the iPhone.\"\n\nTesla will have to sell eight home battery systems to equal the size of each battery pack going into one of its luxury cars, he said.\n\nEnvironmentally conscious consumers -- think: Nissan 7201 -0.68 % Leaf drivers -- are likely to opt for these types of home batteries, said Venkat Srinivasan, head of the battery program at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. But battery prices need to drop by about 75% before they go mainstream, he said. \"The big catch will be decreasing the costs.\"\n\nTesla says it has an answer for that, too: the giant battery factory it is building in Reno, Nev., with Panasonic Corp. 6752 -1.62 % , which makes the batteries it uses in its cars. Tesla says the new plant can cut 30% off the cost of producing batteries.\n\nENLARGE Tesla unveiled Thursday a suite of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities, including a very large utility pack called a Powerpack. Photo: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nFor consumers, Tesla is offering a 7 kilowatt-hour system for $3,000 and a 10 kilowatt-hour battery pack for $3,500. Since the average house creates an electrical load of 2 to 5 kilowatts, the packs could power an entire house for a couple of hours. Or they could run essential household circuits -- a refrigerator, microwave, lights and fans -- throughout the evening when solar panels don't produce, provided there was enough sun during the day to charge up the batteries.\n\nThe devices, which feature a 10-year warranty, would be bolted to a wall near an electrical panel. Special controllers would toggle between batteries and solar panels, deciding when to put power on the grid or pump it into batteries. These same smart controls would also decide when to release power from the batteries.\n\nBatteries are only a small piece of the total cost of a solar/storage system. An integrated system includes solar panels, batteries and inverter, smart controls, building permits, labor and other costs that can add up to $20,000 or more.\n\nTesla's prices for installing batteries and other equipment are on the low end of the energy storage market's current range of $800 to $2,000 a kilowatt-hour, said GTM Research analyst Ravi Manghani. Those installation prices need to drop by half or more, to less than $500 a kilowatt-hour to attract a lot of demand, he predicted.\n\nBut there are other, less cost-conscious customers for energy storage. Businesses, which pay extra charges based on their peak demand for power, are already starting to use the equipment to cut their energy use and utility bills.\n\nUtilities themselves are also interested in bigger battery systems to help them even out the fluctuating flows of electricity from solar farms or wind turbines, keeping the grid stable or eliminating the need for expensive grid upgrades.\n\nUtilities think energy storage will become an essential part of the electric system in coming years because so much renewable energy is being added to the grid, said Mark Rawson, head of technology for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California.\n\nLithium ion technology, which Tesla uses, looks good today because it can absorb and release electricity relatively quickly and can go through many charge and discharge cycles without failing, he said. \"But I wouldn't say it's a silver bullet. There's still lots of innovation happening.\"\n\nWrite to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com and Cassandra Sweet at cassandra.sweet@wsj.com", "It has been three weeks since Samsung's new Galaxy S series flagship smartphones featuring cutting edge technology went on sale in the UK and other regions across the globe.\n\nWhile most of you are quite familiar with Galaxy devices, those who have bought a brand new Galaxy S6 or, S6 Edge would be in search of guides to access all the new features Samsung has stuffed.\n\nIBTimes UK brings you a list which bundles a whole lot of tips and tricks to get started with the new Galaxy devices.

For the purposes of looking into this further, it helps to categorize phablets and differentiate them from smartphones. Flurry looks at usage data in the following categories:\n\nPhablets are essentially a larger phone or a smaller tablet with cellular radio capability. While there are smaller 8 inch tablets like the iPad Mini and Samsung Galaxy Tab 8 that sport cellular capability, the phablet definition is limited to screen sizes under 7 inches -- perhaps that being the limit of how ridiculous it looks to put such a device to your ear to use as a phone.\n\nThe report noted that phablets usage has more than tripled over the past two years, growing from 5% to 20% of active devices. Most of this growth appears to come at the expense of medium-sized phones (3.5 to 4.9 inches). Flurry's numbers are based on the 1.6 billion devices that it claims it tracks, its analytics capabilities being integrated into some 540,000 apps. The company has been in the mobile analytics space since 2005 and was purchased by Yahoo in July 2014 for an estimated $240 million.\n\nSamsung ignited the phablet segment with the introduction of the original Galaxy Note in 2011. That model had a 5.3-inch screen, which was gigantic for a phone at that time. While somewhat derided at first in the US as not really a phone, it has proven popular in all markets around the world, selling 50 million devices in the first two years. It has spawned many competitors, and now the flagship phones from Samsung, LG, Microsoft's Nokia, Sony, OnePlus One, and others are all in the phablet size range. Apple jumped into the fray last fall with the introduction of the iPhone 6 Plus, and it has also been hugely popular.\n\nPhablets have been most popular in Asia, where people tend to use them as their one device for both phone capabilities and their portal to the Internet. In the second quarter of 2013, research firm IDC reported that phablets shipments were double that of tablets and laptops in the Asia Pacific region. In high growth markets like India, phablets account for more than 30% of all smartphone sales, and tablet sales are declining.\n\nWe can slice and dice the numbers all day long, but what does it really mean? In the end, phablets are just another form factor. They are popular because they offer distinct advantages. As we rely more on our devices that are always with us for all sorts of information and communication, for a great number of people the larger screen size is simply easier to read and use for most apps.\n\nWhile not everyone wants to carry a device with a 6-inch screen around, and one handed use may not be easy, the increased screen size - especially with today's high resolutions - make for a better experience for many. And while holding a large phone to the ear may be awkward, there are many Bluetooth headsets and speakers, as well as nearly ubiquitous Bluetooth in cars that mitigate that. More significantly, voice, while still important, is no longer the killer app in mobile devices.\n\nThe phablet will likely most cannibalize small tablet sales. There is a fair amount of overlap there. If you have 5.5-inch phablet, is a 7-inch tablet that much of a step up in screen? The numbers already show a decrease in sales in that tablet size. But there is still a big difference in a 5.5-inch versus a 9- or 11-inch tablet screen, and apps can be optimized for both and offer different experiences. As far as laptops, they will continue to decline overall, as tablets will cannibalize more of casual use for Internet browsing, apps, and content consumption. But they won't go away, any more than desktops have gone away.\n\nClearly the mix of devices we use has changed and will continue to evolve. As technology enables certain capabilities in new form factors that are smaller, lighter, more portable, longer lasting (batteries), and so on, then people shift their habits and device usage. We should expect the same with wearables. As wearables get more sophisticated, for example, adding GPS and cellular capability, some of those will replace certain smartphone sales. In the end, it's just another phase of the evolution of computing we've been experiencing for the past 50 years.\n\nWhat does it mean from the point of view of the major ecosystems? Given Android's openness and availability to device manufacturers, Android phablets dominate in the market. There are countless (well, OK, many) phablet devices available, versus just one iPhone phablet. But that dominance has not translated to larger tablets (yet), where Apple still holds a 36% share of the market (in shipments) and a larger share of the revenue and profit. BlackBerry is no longer a player at this point, and it remains to be seen what Microsoft and Windows 10 does in mobile devices going forward. One might surmise that Apple might want more of a budget phablet, especially to capture additional market share in Asia. Nokia had a 6-inch phablet and one would think Microsoft is not going to be left out in that segment in the future.\n\nIt's difficult to say what will happen in the future by just extrapolating from today's trend. New technologies - like folding screens - might create entirely new categories of mobile devices. We may be talking about foldiphablets in five years.", "The smartphone has a better screen and cameras than the G3, its predecessor\n\nView all images\n\nLG Electronics is giving its latest flagship smartphone, the leather-covered G4, a big removable battery and a power-efficient processor, hoping a long battery life will help it stand out among tough competitors.\n\nThe G4, teased for weeks, was finally unveiled on Tuesday at events around the world. The company hopes to repeat the success it had last year with the G3 and compete head-on with the Galaxy S6 from Samsung, arguably the best Android-based smartphone. But LG has chosen a slightly different approach on the inside and the outside.\n\nLike Samsung, LG used premium materials other than plastic. But instead of using a mixture of aluminium and glass, LG covered the back of the G4 in leather. There are six colors to choose from: black, red, brown, blue, beige and yellow. For leather-averse people, there is a version of the phone with a ceramic back covered in a diamond pattern.\n\nThe G4 has a slight curve along its entire body, which makes the phone more comfortable to hold and more resistant to damage than a flat smartphone when dropped face down, according to LG.\n\nInside, the G4 is the first phone powered by the Snapdragon 808 processor. The 808 uses four power-efficient Cortex-A53 processor cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, which offer better performance but are more power-hungry. LG says the processor offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency. Other high-end Android-based devices such as the Galaxy S6 and HTC's One M9 (which is powered by the Snapdragon 810) use four of each core.\n\nThat gives the G4 an edge when it comes to battery life, at least on paper. It's estimated to last 20 percent longer than the G3, from the same battery capacity, LG said. Just like the G3, it has a 3,000mAh battery that can be removed, a rarity in today's high-end smartphones.\n\nLG has also worked on improving are the camera and the display.\n\nThe screen has the same size and resolution as the G3's, at 5.5 inches and 1440 by 2560 pixels, but it offers better brightness, contrast and color reproduction. Despite the improvements, the new screen shouldn't hurt battery life, according to LG.\n\nUntil in-depth tests are conducted, we won't know exactly what difference the combination of the processor and the new screen will have on the G4's overall performance.\n\nThe main camera's resolution has been upgraded to 16 megapixels. The larger sensor lets in a lot more light to take better images in dark environments. Performance is helped by the camera's upgraded optical image stabilization and laser autofocus. A new feature called Color Spectrum Sensor (CSS) adjusts the cameras white balance and flash color for more natural-looking images.\n\nOn the software side, LG has added support for saving images in a RAW format in addition to JPEG. A new manual mode lets users control the focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance.\n\nThe camera on the front has an 8-megapixel resolution, up from 2.1 megapixels on the G3.\n\nThe G4 has a surface size of 148.9 millimeters by 76.1 millimeters; it's between 6.3 and 9.8 millimeters thick and weighs 155 grams, so it's slightly bigger and heavier than the G3. It has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage that can expanded using the microSD card slot.\n\nThe smartphone will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May. Pricing wasn't immediately available.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\nJoin the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Samsung recently introduced its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge smartphones.\n\nThe upside for Apple is that it increased its share in the first quarter to 17.7 percent from 15.3 percent in the same quarter last year.\n\nSamsung's increased shipments haven't helped boost its financials, which it announced ahead of Strategy Analytics' report. The company said that revenue in its mobile division during the quarter was down by a fifth while operating profit in the division dropped by 57 percent year-on-year.\n\nOverall, smartphone shipments worldwide grew 21 percent annually to 345 million from 285 million phones in the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, global smartphone growth slowed to 21 percent from 33 percent, reflecting increased penetration and maturity of key markets like China, U.S., and Europe.\n\nLenovo, which acquired Motorola Mobility from Google, registered a market share of 5.4 percent, but this was lower than the close to 7 percent share it had in the same quarter last year. Lenovo is facing competition in China's LTE market, while its Motorola business is struggling to expand in its core market of North America and in India, which it has identified as a growth market, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nHuawei increased its share in the quarter to 5 percent, as it starts selling online in China and through retailers across Africa, in line with a focus on developing regions.\n\nSmartphones accounted for eight out of every 10 mobile phones shipped in the quarter, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nSamsung also led the global mobile phone market after shipping 99 million phones for a 22.2 percent share down, down from 27.4 percent in the same quarter last year. Apple captured a 13.7 percent share, up from 10.6 percent.\n\nMicrosoft, which now owns Nokia's phone business, accounted for 7.6 percent of the market, down from 11.4 percent. The company shipped 33.7 million phones, losing ground in feature phones, while potential Lumia smartphones customers hold back purchases ahead of the launch of Windows 10 later this year.\n\nTotal mobile phones shipped were 445 million, up 8 percent from the same quarter last year.\n\nJohn Ribeiro covers outsourcing and general technology breaking news from India for The IDG News Service.

But there are still differences that may be relevant to your purchase decision. Here's a spec comparison between the phones:\n\nDesign\n\nA more premium design has been a common theme for this year's launches of high-end smartphones. The Galaxy S6 combines a metal frame with a glass back, while the G4 has a plastic frame and offers the option of a back made of leather or a mixture of ceramics and plastic.\n\nThe G4's leather back looks good, but the other materials aren't on the same level. Still, the leather gives the phone a pleasant texture, and the G4 feels better to hold than the Galaxy S6, which is the better looking of the two.\n\nProcessor\n\nBoth the Galaxy S6 and G4 are powered by ARM-based processors, though with slightly different configurations. The Snapdragon 808 is LG's processor of choice for the G4. It is the first to pick that chip, and the reasoning was that it offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency.\n\nThe processor uses the same ARM cores as Qualcomm's top model, the Snapdragon 810. Both chips use four Cortex-A53 cores, but while the 810 has four Cortex-A57 cores, the 808 has two. The Galaxy S6 is powered by its in-house developed Exynos processor that also has four Cortex-A53 cores and four Cortex-A57 cores.\n\nScreen\n\nSamsung and LG are in agreement that a smartphone in the high-end segment should have a screen with a 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution. But they differ on what's the best screen size: the Galaxy S6 has a 5.1-inch screen while the G4's screen measures 5.5 inches.\n\nCompeting vendors make the case that the addition of the higher resolution takes too much of a toll on the battery. However, the screens on the Galaxy S6 and the G4 look really good, and features like quick charging make a shorter battery life less of a hassle. The G4 also has a user exchangeable battery.\n\nSize\n\nThe big screen on the G4 comes at a cost. The Galaxy S6 is 17 grams lighter than the G4, which weighs 155 grams. The Samsung device is also smaller: it measures 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 millimeters compared to the G4's dimensions of 148.9 x 76.1.7 x 9.8 mm. The G4 is unfortunately bigger and heavier than its predecessor, the G3, as well.\n\nStorage\n\nSamsung and LG have chosen slightly different approaches when it comes to integrated storage. The Galaxy S6 comes with 32GB, 64GB or 128GB, while the G4 has 32GB of storage. But people who chose the latter can expand the capacity using the MicroSD card slot, which Samsung decided to skip. The optimum configuration would be 64GB and a MicroSD card slot, so neither company gets it completely right.\n\nCamera\n\nSmartphone vendors have long relied on camera improvements to help convince users to upgrade, and the G4 and Galaxy S6 are no different. The main cameras on both models have a 16 megapixel resolution. And features such as optical image stabilization help improve performance in low-light conditions. The Galaxy S6 has a 5 megapixel front camera and the G4 has an 8 megapixel version.\n\nPricing\n\nIt seems the G4 will be the cheaper of the two. The smartphone will cost from \u00a3500 (US$765) including tax and without a contract, compared to \u00a3600 for the 32GB version of the Galaxy S6 when buying it from Samsung. The G4 will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\nJoin the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

But Apple is closing in, thanks to demand for its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and may even overtake Xiaomi this year.\n\nIn this year's first quarter, Xiaomi claimed a 13 percent share, while Apple captured 12 percent, research firm Strategy Analytics said Wednesday. In the first quarter of last year, Apple's share was 8 percent compared to Xiaomi's 11 percent.\n\nXiaomi, a maker of inexpensive Android phones, is riding on the success of its Redmi models, which can start at 599 yuan (US$98) when bought without carrier subsidies.\n\nBut the company's smartphone shipments have been declining over the past two quarters, Strategy Analytics said. Apple, on the other hand, witnessed booming sales. In the quarter, Apple shipped 13.5 million smartphones to the country, up from 7.8 million units a year ago.\n\nDemand for iPhones is so high that Apple could become China's largest smartphone vendor later this year, Strategy Analytics added. Apple's iPhone 6 starts at 5288 yuan, making it more expensive than phones from Xiaomi.\n\nChinese consumers have said the iPhone 6's bigger-screen size and Apple's famous brand are reasons why customers are flocking to buy the devices.\n\nAs for Samsung Electronics, the South Korean company's market share continues to sag. It ranked as China's fourth largest vendor in the quarter, with a 10 percent market share, said Linda Sui, an analyst with the research firm.\n\nThis is the first time since the end of 2011, when the company was ranked fourth place in China, she added. Samsung had once been China's leading smartphone vendor, but it's faced intense competition from Apple and domestic handset vendors such as Xiaomi, offering low-cost but feature-rich smartphones.\n\nSamsung, however, recently launched its newest flagship phones, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, which should catapult the company back into the top 3 rankings, Sui added.\n\nRanking in third place was Huawei, which also had a 10 percent share. It accomplished this, by selling more phones online and improving its product design, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nJoin the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

After leaving the plane with a tired and fractious family, you find yourself stood before the luggage conveyor belt - with no sign of your suitcase.\n\nBut one firm is attempting to reduce the stress of worrying if your bag has been irretrievably lost - by fitting their designs with microchips.\n\nThe technology, using global positioning systems similar to that found in a mobile phone, could also end the uncertainty over when a bag is about to appear on a baggage carousel.\n\nIt could also share specific information with an owner's mobile phone so if you are prone to leaving bags behind it can send an alert if you stray more than a few meters from it, also helping to reduce theft.\n\nThe smart bag, which is being developed by Hong Kong based Samsonite in partnership with South Korea's Samsung, could also be able to offer travellers a raft of other features.\n\nSamsonite chief executive Ramesh Tainwala told the Mail: 'Smart luggage will be able to communicate with you but it needs to be able to do much more than just give its location.\n\n'We are working with Samsung to create something that is more than a gimmick.'\n\nThe future will see your bag sending you a message when it has left the aircraft and then again when it is about to join the carousel.\n\nBut the technology does not stop there - the chip can also send out an alert if the bag is being opened and the firm is also working on a project to develop 'self-propelling' luggage.\n\nThis could spell an end to having to cart your bags about.\n\nThe firm has been testing luggage fitted with an engine that is able to follow its owner just inches behind.\n\n'This is a utopia we are working towards but we are not quite there yet,' says Tainwala. 'It's a blue sky idea where the bag will follow you 6 inches behind. It's a bit like a programmable remote control car.\n\n'At this stage the real focus is on a motor with a remote control that needs to be light and small. The early prototypes use an engine that takes up a third of the space and weighs 20 kilos.\n\n'But if you look at music speakers, they used to be huge and are now tiny. So we revisit this project regularly.'\n\nOne project that is likely to become available much sooner will be the bag that self-checks in at the airport.\n\nSamsonite is working with Emirates, Lufthansa and KLM Air France to bring an end to that holiday nightmare - the lengthy airport check in.\n\nPassengers can already generate their own boarding pass at home or on their mobile phones but have to stand in line to deposit their bags to get a receipt.\n\nThe new smart bags will check themselves in. The airlines are working on technology that means as soon as a passenger arrives at the airport the chip would identify who owns the bag.\n\nIt will then be remotely programmed with details such as the airline and destination, and rather like the baggage carousels at the end of a journey, passengers will just leave their bags on a conveyor.\n\nIt will check the weight, and then generate a unique identifying code for your bag and that journey, and send it to you mobile phone.\n\nTainwala says: 'Emirates and Lufthansa are working on this. There is no reason why luggage can't get connected. If you can communicate with your bag then why not the airlines?'\n\nThe technology does have some issues. It does not work if there are connections with different airlines who do not use the same technology.\n\nThere are also security issues - the airlines will not want passengers to be able to connect to their bags while in flight.\n\nOne idea that might not catch on is convincing consumers that luggage is a fashion accessory that needs to be replaced every six months to keep on trend.\n\nIn the next few weeks the firm will launch a range of limited edition Liberty print bags, in trade mark floral design, aimed at moving Samsonite into the world of fashion.\n\n'We are trying to encourage people to change their bags every six months to keep pace with trends,' says Tainwala.\n\nIt's a big ask given some of his products retail for upwards of \u00a3600 a piece.\n\n'The most important thing is luggage must be seen as a beautiful object of desire and part of your personality,' he says. 'When you walk with luggage it says something about you'.\n\nThe firm is looking to offer a trade in programme, similar to a car dealership, where customers are offered a rebate to trade up to the latest model.\n\nIn the next few weeks it will also start a trial in France and Germany where customers can personalise their bags online printing their names on the wheel handle, and changing the colours of handles and locks.\n\nEventually the whole bag will be able to be personalised in terms of colours and even images with bags emblazoned with pets, children and individual designs.", "SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, executive vice president Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nFollow live coverage of Microsoft's Build conference below.

It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.", "Windows 10 has already been confirmed as a singular unifying operating system that will work across desktops, tablets and smartphones. However, Microsoft has revealed that the Operating System (OS) will be able to morph into a full-fledged desktop OS with \"Continuum,\" when the Windows Phone senses it.\n\nWith Continuum for phones, we believe any phone can be your PC,\" said Joe Belfiore, Microsoft's corporate vice president of the operating systems group, on Wednesday at the company's annual developer conference in San Francisco.\n\nJoe has essentially offered a way to carry our entire workstation in our pockets. Smartphones are getting ever powerful and already have hardware that will put last year's desktop computers to shame. If they are able to run a complete and full-blown version of Windows 10, it could spell the end of desktop computers and may slash the sales of laptops and tablets as well.\n\nIt may appear as though Microsoft is unconcerned about the impact on sale of hardware, but instead is solely focused on building a holistic ecosystem of devices that run on a single OS and have a singular App Store. On the contrary, the Redmond-based company's latest announcement might just help push the sale of tablets and ultra-books.\n\nContinuum is a basically a software tool or an instructional sub-layer that senses how you are using the device running Windows 10 and then molds the user-interface accordingly. For example, Continuum will sense when you're using Windows 10 with a mouse and keyboard attachment or when you've switched to a touch interface with finger- and pen-based inputs.\n\nContinuum Will Sense The Hardware Connected To Windows Phone And Reconfigure The User Interface\n\nAccordingly, the user-interface will alter, allowing the user to be a lot more productive with a mouse-keyboard layout and enable the user to consume more content with a touch-based interface.\n\nThose who have used Samsung's Galaxy Note, will realize the dynamic alteration of the user-interface is quite similar to their device, when they whip out the stylus. However, Microsoft has extended the feature to a great extent, demonstrated Joe, during Microsoft's Build 2015 keynote.\n\nWhen Joe plugged his Windows Phone into a PC monitor, the PowerPoint App realigned to become a full-blown PC Application. Joe noted the company was able to offer this feature, \"because it is in fact the same code that you would see for PowerPoint on a PC.\" Essentially, any \"app\" when opened on the phone, Continuum switched them to PC-style apps when the device was docked.\n\nMultitude Of Portable Devices Running Windows 10 Could Start Replacing Traditional Workstations\n\nFor an operating system that is touted to work across myriad hardware platforms, Continuum seems to be an ideal component in Windows 10 which might finally allow us to carry our workstation in our pocket, provided it sports some pretty powerful internals.\n\n[Image Credit | TechCrunch, WPD]", "Apple Watch and tattoos aren't such great bedfellows, it seems. If you're hoping to use the heart rate monitor and you're inked, you could find yourself disappointed.\n\nWhile it's a popular idea to get a tattoo to commemorate events in your life, Apple's latest technology could prove useless if you've had it done. At upwards of $17,000 for a top-of-the-line, 18-karat gold wearable, this is one app you might discover you can't use.\n\nWhile it's unclear exactly what extent the tattoo problem can reach, the most common issue is with the sleeve ink jobs.\n\nApple has confirmed that the device's method of measuring your heart rate can clash with deviations in skin color. The device's sensor uses an infrared and green-colored light to determine blood flow, and some kinds of ink - it isn't clear which types, colors, or patterns cause problems - interfere with the information the Apple Watch reads through a tattoo.\n\nApple Watch has tattoo trouble - Apple confirms http://t.co/kmQC2rtcve pic.twitter.com/9BnZUiW5cu\n\n-- Sharon Profis (@sharonprofis) May 1, 2015\n\nThe ink can absorb the light and throw off the sensor, in some cases making the application useless. Apple has updated the support page on their website with a disclaimer for the new wearable.\n\n\"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance. The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\"\n\nThis could also create problems with the marketability of the device, since there is already competition from Sony, Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, LG, and Pebble, says CNet. If the heart rate monitor is a reason for the purchase, Apple could lose money to potentially less expensive competitors.\n\nEven Fitbit and Microsoft have wearable bands which offer the same utility.\n\nThe same sensors it uses to measure your heart rate are the ones it uses to determine if you're wearing it, and if it doesn't think it's being worn, it might not work at all. Tattoos could be Apple's greatest enemy until they can find a way around it.\n\nSo far, the Apple Watch tattoo problem isn't setting it back though. The device is already on back-order, with pre-ordering consumers likely not seeing theirs until June or July.\n\n[Image via Apple / I4U]", "The high-end smartphone battle is getting even more interesting with the launch of LG's latest model\n\nView all images\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 has emerged as the benchmark for flagship smartphones running Android, but there are lots of challengers, including the new G4 from LG Electronics.\n\nThe companies have had many of the same goals when building their respective high-end models, including improving the looks and the cameras. But there are still differences that may be relevant to your purchase decision. Here's a spec comparison between the phones:\n\nDesign\n\nA more premium design has been a common theme for this year's launches of high-end smartphones. The Galaxy S6 combines a metal frame with a glass back, while the G4 has a plastic frame and offers the option of a back made of leather or a mixture of ceramics and plastic.\n\nThe G4's leather back looks good, but the other materials aren't on the same level. Still, the leather gives the phone a pleasant texture, and the G4 feels better to hold than the Galaxy S6, which is the better looking of the two.\n\nProcessor\n\nBoth the Galaxy S6 and G4 are powered by ARM-based processors, though with slightly different configurations. The Snapdragon 808 is LG's processor of choice for the G4. It is the first to pick that chip, and the reasoning was that it offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency.\n\nThe processor uses the same ARM cores as Qualcomm's top model, the Snapdragon 810. Both chips use four Cortex-A53 cores, but while the 810 has four Cortex-A57 cores, the 808 has two. The Galaxy S6 is powered by its in-house developed Exynos processor that also has four Cortex-A53 cores and four Cortex-A57 cores.\n\nScreen\n\nSamsung and LG are in agreement that a smartphone in the high-end segment should have a screen with a 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution. But they differ on what's the best screen size: the Galaxy S6 has a 5.1-inch screen while the G4's screen measures 5.5 inches.\n\nCompeting vendors make the case that the addition of the higher resolution takes too much of a toll on the battery. However, the screens on the Galaxy S6 and the G4 look really good, and features like quick charging make a shorter battery life less of a hassle. The G4 also has a user exchangeable battery.\n\nSize\n\nThe big screen on the G4 comes at a cost. The Galaxy S6 is 17 grams lighter than the G4, which weighs 155 grams. The Samsung device is also smaller: it measures 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 millimeters compared to the G4's dimensions of 148.9 x 76.1.7 x 9.8 mm. The G4 is unfortunately bigger and heavier than its predecessor, the G3, as well.\n\nStorage\n\nSamsung and LG have chosen slightly different approaches when it comes to integrated storage. The Galaxy S6 comes with 32GB, 64GB or 128GB, while the G4 has 32GB of storage. But people who chose the latter can expand the capacity using the MicroSD card slot, which Samsung decided to skip. The optimum configuration would be 64GB and a MicroSD card slot, so neither company gets it completely right.\n\nCamera\n\nSmartphone vendors have long relied on camera improvements to help convince users to upgrade, and the G4 and Galaxy S6 are no different. The main cameras on both models have a 16 megapixel resolution. And features such as optical image stabilization help improve performance in low-light conditions. The Galaxy S6 has a 5 megapixel front camera and the G4 has an 8 megapixel version.\n\nPricing\n\nIt seems the G4 will be the cheaper of the two. The smartphone will cost from \u00a3500 (US$765) including tax and without a contract, compared to \u00a3600 for the 32GB version of the Galaxy S6 when buying it from Samsung. The G4 will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\nJoin the PC World newsletter!

The company hopes to repeat the success it had last year with the G3 and compete head-on with the Galaxy S6 from Samsung, arguably the best Android-based smartphone. But LG has chosen a slightly different approach on the inside and the outside.\n\nLike Samsung, LG used premium materials other than plastic. But instead of using a mixture of aluminium and glass, LG covered the back of the G4 in leather. There are six colors to choose from: black, red, brown, blue, beige and yellow. For leather-averse people, there is a version of the phone with a ceramic back covered in a diamond pattern.\n\nThe G4 has a slight curve along its entire body, which makes the phone more comfortable to hold and more resistant to damage than a flat smartphone when dropped face down, according to LG.\n\nInside, the G4 is the first phone powered by the Snapdragon 808 processor. The 808 uses four power-efficient Cortex-A53 processor cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, which offer better performance but are more power-hungry. LG says the processor offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency. Other high-end Android-based devices such as the Galaxy S6 and HTC's One M9 (which is powered by the Snapdragon 810) use four of each core.\n\nThat gives the G4 an edge when it comes to battery life, at least on paper. It's estimated to last 20 percent longer than the G3, from the same battery capacity, LG said. Just like the G3, it has a 3,000mAh battery that can be removed, a rarity in today's high-end smartphones.\n\nLG has also worked on improving are the camera and the display.\n\nThe screen has the same size and resolution as the G3's, at 5.5 inches and 1440 by 2560 pixels, but it offers better brightness, contrast and color reproduction. Despite the improvements, the new screen shouldn't hurt battery life, according to LG.\n\nUntil in-depth tests are conducted, we won't know exactly what difference the combination of the processor and the new screen will have on the G4's overall performance.\n\nThe main camera's resolution has been upgraded to 16 megapixels. The larger sensor lets in a lot more light to take better images in dark environments. Performance is helped by the camera's upgraded optical image stabilization and laser autofocus. A new feature called Color Spectrum Sensor (CSS) adjusts the cameras white balance and flash color for more natural-looking images.\n\nOn the software side, LG has added support for saving images in a RAW format in addition to JPEG. A new manual mode lets users control the focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance.\n\nThe camera on the front has an 8-megapixel resolution, up from 2.1 megapixels on the G3.\n\nThe G4 has a surface size of 148.9 millimeters by 76.1 millimeters; it's between 6.3 and 9.8 millimeters thick and weighs 155 grams, so it's slightly bigger and heavier than the G3. It has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage that can expanded using the microSD card slot.\n\nThe smartphone will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May.

Samsung recently introduced its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge smartphones.\n\nThe upside for Apple is that it increased its share in the first quarter to 17.7 percent from 15.3 percent in the same quarter last year.\n\nSamsung's increased shipments haven't helped boost its financials, which it announced ahead of Strategy Analytics' report. The company said that revenue in its mobile division during the quarter was down by a fifth while operating profit in the division dropped by 57 percent year-on-year.\n\nOverall, smartphone shipments worldwide grew 21 percent annually to 345 million from 285 million phones in the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, global smartphone growth slowed to 21 percent from 33 percent, reflecting increased penetration and maturity of key markets like China, U.S., and Europe.\n\nLenovo, which acquired Motorola Mobility from Google, registered a market share of 5.4 percent, but this was lower than the close to 7 percent share it had in the same quarter last year. Lenovo is facing competition in China's LTE market, while its Motorola business is struggling to expand in its core market of North America and in India, which it has identified as a growth market, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nHuawei increased its share in the quarter to 5 percent, as it starts selling online in China and through retailers across Africa, in line with a focus on developing regions.\n\nSmartphones accounted for eight out of every 10 mobile phones shipped in the quarter, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nSamsung also led the global mobile phone market after shipping 99 million phones for a 22.2 percent share down, down from 27.4 percent in the same quarter last year. Apple captured a 13.7 percent share, up from 10.6 percent.\n\nMicrosoft, which now owns Nokia's phone business, accounted for 7.6 percent of the market, down from 11.4 percent. The company shipped 33.7 million phones, losing ground in feature phones, while potential Lumia smartphones customers hold back purchases ahead of the launch of Windows 10 later this year.\n\nTotal mobile phones shipped were 445 million, up 8 percent from the same quarter last year.\n\nJohn Ribeiro covers outsourcing and general technology breaking news from India for The IDG News Service.

Gold Associates. \"There have been a lot of false starts over the years, even from Apple ... and certainly others too that have ticked-off consumers.\"\n\nIt's surprising that there aren't more glitches and complaints given the growing complexity, number of working parts and lines of code in wearables and mobile devices, analysts noted.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge onboard diagnostic screen in landscape modeMatt HamblenThis photo shows how the onboard diagnostic screen should rotate into landscape mode -- unlike the faulty units.\n\nThe issues at hand\n\nMost recently with the Apple Watch, which shipped April 24, customers this week tweeted concerns under the hashtag #tattoogate about the heart-rate monitor not working on tattooed skin.\n\nThere was also a report in the Wall Street Journal overall Watch production was slowed because of a faulty taptic engine, used to gently tap the wrist for alerts, made by one of two manufacturers. That report was a disappointment to some customers on waiting lists.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman refused to comment on the taptic engine report. On the tattoo matter, she pointed to an Apple support website that states, \"Apple Watch may not be able to get a reliable heart rate reading every time for everybody.\"\n\nThe Watch's heart rate sensor uses photoplethysmography technology with LED lights on the back to detect the amount of blood flowing through the user's wrist. The website adds: \"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance. The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\"\n\nA separate concern with the Samsung Edge goes back to when the smartphone started shipping April 10. Three weeks later, customers are still complaining on user forums about a screen rotation problem from portrait (vertical) to landscape (horizontal) that Samsung has said affects a \"very limited\" number of Edge devices.\n\nUser responses\n\nWith the new Samsung Edge smartphone, some users seem willing to go to a store or use a delivery service to get a second, third, or even fourth copy of the same device if the first one goes flunky.\n\nOne forum comment posted by \"overtheVerizon\" on April 26 said the third Edge obtained from Verizon Wireless was working so far, an indication that the problem was hardware-related, not because of a software continuity foible.\n\nAt one point on April 22, Samsung advised users to call 1-800-SAMSUNG for help, but many users said in forums it might be best to return a faulty device to the carrier involved for an exchange if done before the 14-day return period expires. A Verizon Wireless community forum included a recommendation to Verizon customers with an Edge to call 1-800-922-0204, while noting that the Samsung warranty on the phones is good for one year.\n\nA Verizon spokesman, in an email to Computerworld, said the rotation problem affects a small number of devices, but he couldn't say if the issue was hardware or software-related. He also said the problem was still being evaluated by Verizon, separately from Samsung. At one Best Buy store, a repair technician told Computerworld that Samsung is aware of the problem with the Edge and urged customers to call the 1-800-SAMSUNG. He couldn't say what the source of the problem is.\n\nThe Apple Watch is still early in the game, but some disappointments about the tattoo-related problem have already surfaced. One user with wrist tattoos named \"Techjas\" got the Watch recently and asked on the Apple Watch forum, \"How is Apple going to handle it? Right now I am not sure I want a watch I have to 'rig' to get it to work correctly.\"\n\nBusiness as usual\n\nThe typical industry response to such concerns is that new products sometimes have glitches and that's to be expected.\n\nBut the problem goes deeper than that, to how well vendors and carriers handle the service calls and visits to stores when problems arise -- if only to retain loyal customers. Based on user forums, the service calls for the Edge rotation problem can sometimes be easy, but are more often exasperating.\n\nA senior project manager at a tech company who asked not to be named emailed Computerworld to say he called the Samsung support line because his Edge phone's screen was locked in portrait position. He was told to send the device back to Samsung for evaluation, but the manager was concerned because he would have no phone for nine business days with no loaner phone provided. The only other option he was offered was to contact his carrier, and if he had third-party insurance he should use it to \"see what can be done.\"\n\nWhat angers customers more than a technical problem is being ignored by a vendor or treated like an idiot for making a complaint, in person or over the phone with a service representative.\n\n\"Vendors don't admit any problems until they absolutely have to,\" Gold said. \"That sometimes leaves consumers in the dark and potentially unable to fix some problems with their devices.\"\n\nWhen vendors do make an admission, the problem may be waved away as an \"issue\" or a \"glitch\" or something \"easily fixed\" by a software update or a supposedly simple return to the store.\n\nCustomers who love a certain vendor -- Apple is a prime example -- seem to be willing to put up with a lot of headaches. \"If you are in love with Apple, you are more accepting of any faults that come along, but this applies to other vendors too,\" Gold said.\n\n\"Consumers have gotten spoiled over the years in expecting all products released to be great upfront, when in reality many vendors take significant risks with new technology that doesn't work as planned,\" Gold said.\n\nWith smartphones, it has become easier to switch carriers or smartphone platforms, which poses a problem for vendors that need customers to remain loyal to maintain profits. \"It's a big problem for vendors in a hyper-competitive market like phones to even admit there is a problem, with the fear it will dramatically affect sales,\" Gold said.\n\nCarolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel, said Samsung did well in acknowledging the screen rotation issue and then in saying there was a fix. \"Possibly that second step could have been a bit more specific, so if that problem persisted with some users, they would know what to do,\" she said.\n\nSeveral analysts said the Samsung Edge problem does appear to affect a limited number of phones, an indication of a possible hardware problem with the phone's accelerometer or the software directly related to it.\n\nBecause the extent of the problem seems limited, it probably won't affect Edge sales dramatically. \"It is probably a faulty batch, which will eventually all be replaced,\" said Boris Metodiev, an analyst at 451 Research. Samsung has predicted overall sales of 70 million combined for the Edge and its cousin the Galaxy S6.\n\nMeanwhile, the reported Apple Watch problem with the taptic engine could slow down production although demand still seems sky high.\n\nAs for problems reading heart rates through tattoos, Apple's website makes it fairly clear the issue is something that users with tattoos will have to live with, or connect to an external heart rate monitor wirelessly.

Revenue increased 58.4% year over year to $762.1 million for the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $751.83 million.\n\nThe company said it expects earnings of $1.28 a share and revenue of $800 million for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $1.19 a share and revenue of $781.81 million for the fiscal third quarter.\n\n\"Skyworks outperformance underscores the success of our diversification strategy, as positive momentum across our customer base, end markets and product lines helped to mitigate normal March quarter seasonality,\" Chairmand and CEO David J. Aldrich said.\n\nInsight from TheSteet's Research Team:\n\nSkyworks Solutions is a part of Bryan Ashenberg's\n\nGrowthSeeker.com Portfolio. Here is what Bryan had to say about the stock in a recent alert:\n\nManagement guided fiscal third-quarter revenue to $800 million (up 36% year over year), ahead of Wall Street's forecast of $781 million. Third-quarter EPS are now projected to be $1.28, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.19, and gross margin was targeted to be 48%, up 130 basis points sequentially. Management expect margins will trend positively over the course of 2015. The company continues to see itself on a path to $7 in annualized EPS over the next couple of years, with a 50%+ gross margin. The company is now forecasting a 55%+ incremental gross margins, up from 52%.\n\nFor the second quarter, the company's gross margin totaled 46.7%, up 200 basis points year over year and flat vs. the prior quarter, though ahead of guidance of 46% to 46.5%. Its operating margin of 34% is up a robust 690 basis points year over year, and compares to 35% last quarter. For the second quarter, power amplifiers represented 31% of revenue, integrated mobile systems 47%, and broad markets 22%. Revenue from the company's broad markets, which serve the connected home, networking, media, automotive, and medical markets, grew 27% year to date, well ahead of the analog market.\n\nThe company said that its SkyOne Ultra front-end module has been designed into Samsung's GS6, which combined with strength at Apple (\n\nAAPL:Nasdaq) to allow the company to outperform despite some softness in the Chinese smartphone market. Management expect the migration to 4G/LTE technologies in China will continue and believe 4G smartphones in China will ramp up from around 100 million units in 2014 to a range of 225 million to 250 million in 2015.\n\nSkyworks' balance sheet remains strong as well. The company generated $155 million in cash from operations during the quarter. Cash now totals $1.054 billion, or $5.40 per share, with no debt.\n\nWe have been steadfast believers in the mobile-device megatrend and of wireless connectivity spreading far beyond current applications. Skyworks is everywhere, and continues to diversify its business into broad markets, leading to less seasonality and higher profits. We remain confident that Skyworks is an excellent long-term play on this trend, that its growth outlook is strong and that its visibility is improving.\n\nSkyworks continues to support our thesis that it pays to own a quality name, as the company remains incredibly well positioned to continue to post gains in a healthier end market and in the new world of the Internet of Things.\n\n-Bryan Ashenberg, \"\n\nSkyworks' Guidance Is Better Than Expected,\" originally publiched on 5/01/15 on GrowthSeeker.com\n\nTheStreet Ratings team rates SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n\"We rate SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS INC (SWKS) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, expanding profit margins and good cash flow from operations. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company is trading at a premium valuation based on our review of its current price compared to such things as earnings and book value.\"\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here:\n\nSWKS Ratings Report\n\nSWKS data by YCharts\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 25 Stocks for 2015", "SYDNEY: China's factories stayed stuck in the slow lane in April while Japanese output went into reverse and South Korea suffered its worst export performance in two years, adding urgency to calls for more state stimulus in all three economies.\n\nThailand has already surprised by cutting interest rates this week, while speculation is mounting that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will chop its rates to a record low of 2 percent at a May 5 policy meeting.\n\nThe need for action is all the greater as China, the former engine of global growth, remains jammed in neutral.\n\nChina's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held at 50.1 in April, just a fraction above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.\n\n\"As the economy still faces strong headwinds and the risk of deflation has not diminished, the authorities will need to continue to roll out easing measures in the coming months,\" said Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ.\n\nFollowing an aggressive one-percentage-point cut in banks' reserve requirement ratios last month, ANZ expects China's central bank will lower its interest rates further this quarter.\n\nChina's annual economic growth slowed to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter, hurt by a housing slump and a downturn in investment and manufacturing.\n\nIn just the latest effort to turn the ship around, China's cabinet unveiled new measures on Friday to boost employment, offering more flexible tax breaks to companies to hire and preferential loans to business starters.\n\nBeijing aims to create at least 10 million new jobs in 2015 and keep the urban jobless rate below 4.5 percent.\n\nNOT ENOUGH INFLATION\n\nIn Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI fell to 49.9 in April, from 50.3 in March, taking it into contractionary territory for the first time since May last year.\n\nJapan is emerging from recession at a snail's pace as companies remain wary of ramping up spending despite record profits and consumers keep their wallets shut.\n\nThat is challenging the Bank of Japan's bold pledge to accelerate inflation to 2 percent through massive money printing.\n\nWhile core inflation did edge up a tick to an annual 2.2 percent in April, it is set to fall back toward zero in May when the impact of last year's rise in sales taxes drop out.\n\nNeither have wages benefited as the BOJ hoped. Data out on Friday showed wage earners' total cash earnings were almost flat in March and inflation-adjusted real wages marked a two-year stretch of declines.\n\nAcross in South Korea, government figures showed exports fell 8.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the sharpest drop since February 2013, as shipments to China, the United States and the European Union all lost ground.\n\nConsumer price inflation there is running at a 16-year trough of just 0.4 percent.\n\n\"The government will be sure to focus policy on boosting consumption as exports are no longer performing as they did in the past,\" said Stephen Lee, an economist at Samsung Securities.\n\nThe doleful data follows news the United States grew a bare 0.2 percent annualized in the first quarter of the year, held back by wild weather, a port strike and a strong dollar.\n\nYet there were glints of light in more recent data.\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 15-year low last week and consumer spending rose in March, aided in part by a pick up in wage growth.\n\nAn upturn in wages has long been a key goal of the Federal Reserve and revived market expectations that interest rates would start to rise later this year, albeit not until September at the earliest.\n\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "Luxurious and distinctive -- this is the first Samsung smartphone device - that I'm aware of - that has an all-metal body without a removable battery.\n\nIn the appearances stakes it is probably the most beautiful, the most elegant of Samsung smartphones to date and among the current generation of premium smartphone devices gives the iPhone 6 a run for its money and is much ligher and curvier than the M9 One from HTC.\n\nWhen I first laid eyes on the S6 at the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona I was immediately smitten. Firstly, by the shiny kaleidoscope of colours it came in: from black, to white, to gold to a very bewitching racing-car green. And next by the screen quality, how fluid the software seemed, how well the OS ran; it is a lot more elegant than previous incarnations of Samsung devices.\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress I sensed the smug satisfaction from the Samsung executives all around me. They had completed a new product build that had no discernable loose strings. The product, from the hardware to the OS and its shiny, sleek exterior, came together as one.\n\n\"We have learned from our successes and missteps,\" Samsung Mobile's CEO JK Shin told thousands of attendees at the big reveal of the S6 and the S6 Edge.\n\nPreviously I didn't buy into Samsung's idea of premium phones, since they were mostly being coated in cheap, flimsy removable plastic. This time they got it right with a phone that feels premium. Or did they?\n\nThe only difference between the S6 and the S6 Edge is the curved screen on the Edge. But this adds to the price. According to Samsung the curved glass was created by a process called 3D thermoforming, a process of heating and moulding the glass at a temperature of 800 degrees Celcius.\n\nThis creates an immediatley impressive first impression and I have to say I love how the content on the device appears to wrap itself around the curves of the super Amoled screen.\n\nThe overall impression is a solid, endurable device that feels good in your hand.\n\nThe device comes with a 5.1-inch screen that has an impressive resolution of 577 pixels per inch.\n\nAnother appearane change is the use of a single microUSB port and gone is the USB 3.0 connector of the S5. This looks much more elegant but I'm sure some users will miss the USB 3.0 connector for various reasons. Also gone is the old dependable SD card slot, which is a big change.\n\nThe device comes in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB configurations so that's plenty of data storage for whatever your needs.\n\nThe Android operating system on the device is Android 5.1 Lollypop and I have to say I like what Samsung has done with it. Samsung is famed for either over-engineering Android with its own embelishments or not doing enough with it and I have to say rival HTC has always done a better job.\n\nThis time Samsung has gotten it right. The Android OS feels elegant, is less cluttered and feels colourful and natural - more a Monet than a Kandinsky.\n\nSamsung has also added new features such as colour themes as well as personalisation themes that are there if you want them but at the same time sit respectfully in the background. Areas of the device have been colour coded, Samsung has enabled one-touch auto reply.\n\nAlong with the S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung also revealed the Gear VR, which works with the deivces to bring you Oculus Rift. I tried this in Barcelona too and if I had any doubts about VR, they are long gone.\n\nIn terms of camera technology Samsung has managed to squeeze its new real-time HDR feature into the 5MP front-facing camera, a world first for smartphones. The same real-time HDR technology features on the 16MP rear-facing camera too, which Samsung claims provides better lighting and clarity than on the competing iPhone 6.\n\nIn terms of battery life, I found the battery to be dependable. A single charge would last me 24 hours and beyond. Unfortunately I didn't get to test the wireless induction charging capability that Samsung has introduced for the S6 and S6 Edge. Apparently it can be 40pc charged in 10 minutes and can be fully charged in half the time it takes to charge an iPhone 6. However, in fairness, I found the battery could be fully charged using a standard plug within an hour, which is respectable.\n\nSamsung needed to pull something magical out of the hat to compete with the focus on craftsmanship evident in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus as well as devices from HTC and LG.\n\nThe result is perhaps one of the most premium devices on the market and it will give the iPhone 6 a run for its money.\n\nBut on the other hand the device is pricey - perhaps too pricey to compete in the realm of devices from Xiaomi and Huawei that are hurting Samsung in markets like China.\n\nBut here in Ireland the premium phone will compete in the premium market and the device ranges from \u20ac249.99 right up to \u20ac749 depending on price plans. The device is available from Vodafone, Meteor, Three and Tesco Mobile.", "Quarterly results plus those of Amazon, Facebook and Google excite investors.\n\nFour of the world's most exciting and high-profile companies - Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google - released quarterly results in the past 10 days.\n\nThese announcements have generated a huge amount of commentary, analysis and sharemarket activity.\n\nFor example, US$15.7 billion ($20.7 billion) worth of Apple shares traded on April 28, the day after the company's profit announcement. This was three times Apple's average market turnover for the previous few weeks and is the equivalent of nearly two-thirds of the total value of all shares traded on the New Zealand sharemarket over the past 12 months.\n\nAmazon, Facebook and Google's share trading value shot up to US$7.6 billion, US$6.2 billion and US$2.8 billion respectively on the day following their profit announcements, around three times the normal daily average.\n\nThese figures clearly indicate that sharemarket activity benefits from quarterly profit announcements rather than the six-monthly reporting requirements in New Zealand and most other countries.\n\nApple, which has a sharemarket value of US$721 billion, announced sales revenue of US$58 billion for the March quarter, a 27 per cent increase over the same period in the previous year.\n\nThe iPhone, which represented 69 per cent of Apple's revenue in the latest quarter, remains the company's most important product. iPhone sales have soared from 18.6 million units in the March 2011 quarter to 43.7 million units in the March 2014 quarter and 61.2 million units in the latest three-month period.\n\nThe iPhone's average selling price has increased from US$596 to US$659 per unit over the last 12 months. This reflects the launch of iPhone 6 in September last year.\n\nThe other development is that Apple's Chinese sales soared to US$16.8 billion in the latest quarter compared with US$9.8 billion for the same period last year.\n\nApple is second to Samsung in terms of smartphone sales - 61.2 million units compared with Samsung's 83.2 million units in the March 2015 quarter - but Samsung's Android smartphone prices are falling and are nearly a third of the price of the iPhone.\n\nAs a consequence Samsung's net earnings for the March quarter were down 39 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2014, while Apple's earnings increased by 33 per cent, to US$13.6 billion, year-on-year.\n\nOne of Apple's main strengths is the integration of its hardware (iPhones), software (iOS platform) and app store (iTunes). This enables the company to realise higher prices for its hardware and discourages customers from switching to Android devices.\n\nHowever, the smartphone and tablet markets are incredibly competitive and Apple will have to sustain its innovation in order to maintain its premium price position. The continuing development of its app store will be particularly important in this regard.\n\nAmazon reported net sales of US$22.7 billion for the March quarter, a 15 per cent increase over the same period in the previous year.\n\nThe company has changed its segmentation reporting into three new divisions - North America, which represents 59 per cent of sales, International 34 per cent and Amazon Web services (AWS), which accounts for 7 per cent of revenue.\n\nThe first two represent the company's traditional online retail operations while AWS is essentially an on-demand, pay-as-you-go cloud storage and IT resources offering.\n\nAmazon reported a small loss for the March quarter, as it did for the full December 2014 year, but most commentators take a positive view of the company for a number of reasons including:\n\n* It has 278 million active customers.\n\n* Amazon is leading the move from brick-and-mortar retailing to online retailing.\n\n* It is a low cost operator, particularly compared with brick-and-mortar retailers, and is also a major disruptive force in digital media and cloud computing.\n\nAmazon is an incredibly ambitious and innovative company with 165,000 employees, a 32,400 increase over the past 12 months. Founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos won't rest easy until he has completely dominated a number of the traditional retailing sectors.\n\nFacebook reported revenue of US$3.5 billion for the March quarter, a 42 per cent increase over the same period last year. The company has a sharemarket value to revenue ratio of 16.4 times based on the last 12 months' revenue of US$13.5 billion and a market value of US$221 billion.\n\nOne of Facebook's main attractions is its 936 million daily active users compared with 802 million 12 months ago. There were major concerns a number of years ago that Facebook didn't have effective apps for mobile devices but 798 million of the 936 million daily active users now gain access through mobile devices.\n\nFacebook has 1.4 billion monthly active users representing nearly 20 per cent of the world's population, a remarkable statistic.\n\nThis massive user base gives Facebook enormous advertising opportunities because individuals post a huge amount of personal information that is highly valuable to advertisers on an anonymous basis. Facebook also has a relatively captive audience because it is difficult for users to leave once they have posted a large amount of personal information and have developed a widespread network of online friends.\n\nFacebook can confidently claim that it dominates the social media sector but it is a volatile area as Rupert Murdoch discovered with MySpace. Facebook faces competitive pressure, regulatory risks, privacy issues and the possibility of lower than expected support from advertisers.\n\nGoogle reported revenue of US$17.3 billion for the March quarter, a 12 per cent increase year-on-year. Google is clearly the world's largest search engine followed by Bing and Yahoo, which are a third of Google's size.\n\nBing is owned by Microsoft while Yahoo, which has a share market value of US$40 billion, reported revenue of US$1.2 billion for the March quarter.\n\nGoogle's main assets are its search facilities and YouTube which generate 68 per cent of group revenue. Google's search facility has an estimated 1.1 billion unique monthly visitors, more than all the other search engines combined, while YouTube has over one billion users with 300 hours of new video uploaded every minute.\n\nGoogle also has a wide range of other offerings to attract and keep customers, including Gmail, Google Maps and the Chrome browser, although Google Glass appears to be a commercial failure at this stage.\n\nA number of industry commentators are picking that Apple Watch will also be a commercial failure but this won't have a major impact on Apple because of the success of the iPhone.\n\nGoogle reported net earnings of US$3.6 billion from continuing operations for the March quarter, slightly below the March 2014 quarter figure.\n\nHowever, the share valuations of Google and Facebook are based on their huge audience reach, and the massive advertising revenue potential this offers, rather than their current profitability. Amazon's allure is based on its proven ability to disrupt and replace brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nApple's position is quite different. There is a narrowly held view that the company has already achieved its full potential in terms of new products, revenue and profitability and it will be extremely difficult to maintain this momentum in the longer term. However, given the company's recent performance, it would take a brave person to bet on this outlook.\n\nThere is no doubt that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google continue to have enormous potential and their progress, and share price performances, will be fascinating to watch in the years ahead.\n\n* Brian Gaynor is an executive director of Milford Asset Management which owns shares in Apple, Facebook and Google on behalf of clients.", "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, with a Powerpack unit the background unveils suit of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities at Tesla Design Studio April 30, 2015 in Hawthorne, California. Musk unveiled the home battery named Powerwall with a selling price of $3500 for 10kWh and $3000 for 7kWh and very large utility pack called Powerpack. | Kevork Djansezian via Getty Images\n\nTesla Motors just released the iPad of energy storage.\n\nThe electric automaker on Thursday unveiled a line of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries -- the sort used in the electric automaker's Model S sedans -- meant to store solar energy and power homes and businesses. The sleek, wall-mounted devices collect excess energy from solar panels throughout the day for use at night.\n\nThe batteries, due out this summer, come in two variations. The commercial-scale Powerpack, currently getting a test run at 10 retail stores across the U.S., can be used by businesses. The consumer model, the Powerwall, will sell for up to $3,500 and could rev the nascent energy-storage industry's engine.\n\n\"It's the iPad of stationary storage,\" Jay Whitacre, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the chief technology officer at the sodium-ion battery company Aquion Energy, told The Huffington Post. \"Tablets were out there and no one really wanted them. Then came the iPad.\"\n\nAs with Apple's iconic tablet, Tesla -- armed with CEO Elon Musk's starpower -- could make solar-storage batteries fashionable. Though the company already has a considerable field of rivals, including tech goliath Samsung and Swiss battery startup Alevo, which raised $1 billion in private funding last year, none have generated the same amount of attention as Musk. On stage at a Tesla facility outside Los Angeles on Thursday, the product launch was akin to a new iPhone announcement.\n\nBut the real challenge will be to make owning the home device economical.\n\nThe first problem is the cost. At $3,500 each, the batteries are expensive. And since each one is limited to storing 10 kilowatt-hours of electricity, many homeowners would need to buy several in order to power their homes fully. Tesla is building a $5 billion plant in Nevada, dubbed the Gigafactory, which will produce lithium-ion batteries en masse. But, until then, the price will remain high. To boot, homeowners would have to bear the cost of installing solar panels or wind turbines to charge the batteries in the first place.\n\nThe other issue is the current electricity rate structure in the United States. Here, electricity is more expensive during the day, when solar panels generate energy, and cheaper at night. Utility companies will buy consumers' excess solar generated during peak hours and recirculate it into the power grid, then sell it back at a cheaper night rate, when solar panels aren't producing energy.\n\nTherefore, there's little incentive for people to use solar-storage batteries that hang onto energy during the day if they could be selling it at peak prices to the utility companies and buying it back later on the cheap.\n\n\"It only makes sense for storage if it's more expensive to buy electricity at night and sell it back during the day,\" Brian Warshay, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told HuffPost. \"But most people aren't on those types of rates.\"\n\nGermany, on the other hand, does offer those rates. The country encourages the use of solar storage by charging high rates for electricity drawn from the power grid in the evenings.\n\nSome states have pioneered models similar to Germany's. Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the country, at over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Rates in New England are also high, topping more than 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nBut, across the U.S., the average price of electricity was about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour in February, the most recent month calculated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"For the most part,\" Warshay said, \"grid electricity is just really cheap.\"\n\nAt the moment, then, Tesla's new batteries stand as something of a proof of concept. But if the company can decrease its manufacturing costs, and if states start pricing electricity more aggressively, Musk's vision of a solar-powered future could become a reality.", "The smartphone has a better screen and cameras than the G3, its predecessor\n\nView all images\n\nLG Electronics is giving its latest flagship smartphone, the leather-covered G4, a big removable battery and a power-efficient processor, hoping a long battery life will help it stand out among tough competitors.\n\nThe G4, teased for weeks, was finally unveiled on Tuesday at events around the world. The company hopes to repeat the success it had last year with the G3 and compete head-on with the Galaxy S6 from Samsung, arguably the best Android-based smartphone. But LG has chosen a slightly different approach on the inside and the outside.\n\nLike Samsung, LG used premium materials other than plastic. But instead of using a mixture of aluminium and glass, LG covered the back of the G4 in leather. There are six colors to choose from: black, red, brown, blue, beige and yellow. For leather-averse people, there is a version of the phone with a ceramic back covered in a diamond pattern.\n\nThe G4 has a slight curve along its entire body, which makes the phone more comfortable to hold and more resistant to damage than a flat smartphone when dropped face down, according to LG.\n\nInside, the G4 is the first phone powered by the Snapdragon 808 processor. The 808 uses four power-efficient Cortex-A53 processor cores and two Cortex-A57 cores, which offer better performance but are more power-hungry. LG says the processor offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency. Other high-end Android-based devices such as the Galaxy S6 and HTC's One M9 (which is powered by the Snapdragon 810) use four of each core.\n\nThat gives the G4 an edge when it comes to battery life, at least on paper. It's estimated to last 20 percent longer than the G3, from the same battery capacity, LG said. Just like the G3, it has a 3,000mAh battery that can be removed, a rarity in today's high-end smartphones.\n\nLG has also worked on improving are the camera and the display.\n\nThe screen has the same size and resolution as the G3's, at 5.5 inches and 1440 by 2560 pixels, but it offers better brightness, contrast and color reproduction. Despite the improvements, the new screen shouldn't hurt battery life, according to LG.\n\nUntil in-depth tests are conducted, we won't know exactly what difference the combination of the processor and the new screen will have on the G4's overall performance.\n\nThe main camera's resolution has been upgraded to 16 megapixels. The larger sensor lets in a lot more light to take better images in dark environments. Performance is helped by the camera's upgraded optical image stabilization and laser autofocus. A new feature called Color Spectrum Sensor (CSS) adjusts the cameras white balance and flash color for more natural-looking images.\n\nOn the software side, LG has added support for saving images in a RAW format in addition to JPEG. A new manual mode lets users control the focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance.\n\nThe camera on the front has an 8-megapixel resolution, up from 2.1 megapixels on the G3.\n\nThe G4 has a surface size of 148.9 millimeters by 76.1 millimeters; it's between 6.3 and 9.8 millimeters thick and weighs 155 grams, so it's slightly bigger and heavier than the G3. It has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of integrated storage that can expanded using the microSD card slot.\n\nThe smartphone will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May. Pricing wasn't immediately available.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\nJoin the Computerworld newsletter!

Samsung recently introduced its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge smartphones.\n\nThe upside for Apple is that it increased its share in the first quarter to 17.7 percent from 15.3 percent in the same quarter last year.\n\nSamsung's increased shipments haven't helped boost its financials, which it announced ahead of Strategy Analytics' report. The company said that revenue in its mobile division during the quarter was down by a fifth while operating profit in the division dropped by 57 percent year-on-year.\n\nOverall, smartphone shipments worldwide grew 21 percent annually to 345 million from 285 million phones in the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, global smartphone growth slowed to 21 percent from 33 percent, reflecting increased penetration and maturity of key markets like China, U.S., and Europe.\n\nLenovo, which acquired Motorola Mobility from Google, registered a market share of 5.4 percent, but this was lower than the close to 7 percent share it had in the same quarter last year. Lenovo is facing competition in China's LTE market, while its Motorola business is struggling to expand in its core market of North America and in India, which it has identified as a growth market, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nHuawei increased its share in the quarter to 5 percent, as it starts selling online in China and through retailers across Africa, in line with a focus on developing regions.\n\nSmartphones accounted for eight out of every 10 mobile phones shipped in the quarter, Strategy Analytics said.\n\nSamsung also led the global mobile phone market after shipping 99 million phones for a 22.2 percent share down, down from 27.4 percent in the same quarter last year. Apple captured a 13.7 percent share, up from 10.6 percent.\n\nMicrosoft, which now owns Nokia's phone business, accounted for 7.6 percent of the market, down from 11.4 percent. The company shipped 33.7 million phones, losing ground in feature phones, while potential Lumia smartphones customers hold back purchases ahead of the launch of Windows 10 later this year.\n\nTotal mobile phones shipped were 445 million, up 8 percent from the same quarter last year.\n\nJohn Ribeiro covers outsourcing and general technology breaking news from India for The IDG News Service.

But there are still differences that may be relevant to your purchase decision. Here's a spec comparison between the phones:\n\nDesign\n\nA more premium design has been a common theme for this year's launches of high-end smartphones. The Galaxy S6 combines a metal frame with a glass back, while the G4 has a plastic frame and offers the option of a back made of leather or a mixture of ceramics and plastic.\n\nThe G4's leather back looks good, but the other materials aren't on the same level. Still, the leather gives the phone a pleasant texture, and the G4 feels better to hold than the Galaxy S6, which is the better looking of the two.\n\nProcessor\n\nBoth the Galaxy S6 and G4 are powered by ARM-based processors, though with slightly different configurations. The Snapdragon 808 is LG's processor of choice for the G4. It is the first to pick that chip, and the reasoning was that it offers the best balance between high-end performance and power efficiency.\n\nThe processor uses the same ARM cores as Qualcomm's top model, the Snapdragon 810. Both chips use four Cortex-A53 cores, but while the 810 has four Cortex-A57 cores, the 808 has two. The Galaxy S6 is powered by its in-house developed Exynos processor that also has four Cortex-A53 cores and four Cortex-A57 cores.\n\nScreen\n\nSamsung and LG are in agreement that a smartphone in the high-end segment should have a screen with a 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution. But they differ on what's the best screen size: the Galaxy S6 has a 5.1-inch screen while the G4's screen measures 5.5 inches.\n\nCompeting vendors make the case that the addition of the higher resolution takes too much of a toll on the battery. However, the screens on the Galaxy S6 and the G4 look really good, and features like quick charging make a shorter battery life less of a hassle. The G4 also has a user exchangeable battery.\n\nSize\n\nThe big screen on the G4 comes at a cost. The Galaxy S6 is 17 grams lighter than the G4, which weighs 155 grams. The Samsung device is also smaller: it measures 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 millimeters compared to the G4's dimensions of 148.9 x 76.1.7 x 9.8 mm. The G4 is unfortunately bigger and heavier than its predecessor, the G3, as well.\n\nStorage\n\nSamsung and LG have chosen slightly different approaches when it comes to integrated storage. The Galaxy S6 comes with 32GB, 64GB or 128GB, while the G4 has 32GB of storage. But people who chose the latter can expand the capacity using the MicroSD card slot, which Samsung decided to skip. The optimum configuration would be 64GB and a MicroSD card slot, so neither company gets it completely right.\n\nCamera\n\nSmartphone vendors have long relied on camera improvements to help convince users to upgrade, and the G4 and Galaxy S6 are no different. The main cameras on both models have a 16 megapixel resolution. And features such as optical image stabilization help improve performance in low-light conditions. The Galaxy S6 has a 5 megapixel front camera and the G4 has an 8 megapixel version.\n\nPricing\n\nIt seems the G4 will be the cheaper of the two. The smartphone will cost from \u00a3500 (US$765) including tax and without a contract, compared to \u00a3600 for the 32GB version of the Galaxy S6 when buying it from Samsung. The G4 will start its global rollout on Wednesday in Korea and is expected to go on sale in Europe and the U.S. at the end of May.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\nJoin the Computerworld newsletter!

BG stock tends to perform better when the oil price recovers because it eases concerns over the development of expensive projects, such as in Brazil and East Africa.\n\nSince the cash and stock deal was first discussed by Shell and BG's executives over a phone call in mid- March, the price of oil has risen by 25 percent to $65 per barrel.\n\nGiven that the deal was based on the average share price of BG stock in the three months to April 7, BG's shareholders risk feeling they are not getting full value for that oil bounce.\n\n\"The maths would suggest that were the oil price at or above $80 then Shell would be snaring BG for a very attractive price,\" said Matthew Beesley, head of global equities at Henderson, which has $81 billion under management including BG's stock.\n\n\"While the total determination is of course dependent on the level of Shell shares at the time of issuance to BG shareholders, above $80 its not inconceivable that BG shareholders could start to agitate for a higher bid or indeed a competing bid,\" added Beesley.\n\nBG investors will receive 383 pence in cash and 0.4454 Shell B class shares for each of their BG shares. At current prices, that values BG shares at around 13 pounds, a premium of around 12 percent to where they now trade.\n\nShell, which reports its first quarter results on Thursday, declined to comment.\n\nIvor Pether, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which has $82 billion under management including Shell stock, said he believed that even at $75-$80 per barrel the deal worked for Shell both strategically and financially.\n\n\"If the oil price shot up to that level while the deal was completing it could prompt some debate about the value being offered to BG holders. But you would have to believe the oil price rise was here to stay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't expect major regulatory hurdles, but the timetable isn't clear yet,\" Pether said adding that Shell needs clearance from anti-trust authorities in Brazil, the EU, Australia and China before it can issue offer documents to BG's shareholders.\n\nShell has said it does not expect major obstacles in obtaining anti-trust clearance but has indicated it could extend into 2016 given the complexity of talks.\n\n\"With CEO Ben van Beurden loudly espousing the strategic rationale of the deal and the role it can have in foisting change upon Shell, they'll be looking to get it approved by regulators and closed as soon as they can ? just in case,\" said Beesley.\n\nVan Beurden is determined to make Shell a mega-player and the merger with BG will allow Shell to overtake its top rival U.S. ExxonMobil\n\nVan Beurden has already traveled to Brazil, where he met with the country's leadership as well as Trinidad, where BG has large gas facilities.\n\nChina and Australia will be next on the agenda as the Shell leadership is perfectly aware of the pressures the rising oil price has created, according to industry and banking sources.\n\nBack when the deal was first discussed, it wasn't only the oil price but several other factors, which helped Shell persuade BG's board it was the right deal.\n\n\"The stars really aligned back in March,\" one senior source familiar with the discussions said.\n\nSeveral days before Van Beurden called BG's veteran chairman Andrew Gould to offer the deal, BG's stock fell heavily on news that rival Portuguese firm Galp saw delays to projects in Brazil because of an ongoing corruption probe.\n\nHowever, in the past few weeks the general mood in the oil market has improved, with most industry watchers saying prices could rise further from now on.\n\n(writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Keith Weir)", "New York, NY -- (ReleaseWire) -- 04/29/2015 -- Glycol ethers manufactured through reaction of alcohols with propylene oxide or ethylene oxide.

Also, prices for agricultural products were up 4 percent.\n\n\"Contrary to what we've seen from Syngenta, Dow Chemical and DuPont,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note, comparing BASF's results with those of rivals. \"The best we've seen so far.\"\n\nQuarterly net income fell 20 percent to 1.17 billion euros, below average expectations for 1.27 billion.\n\nShares in BASF were up 0.2 percent at 89.27 euros by 0858 GMT, in line with Germany's blue-chip DAX index.\n\n($1 = 0.9007 euros) (Additional reporting by Patricia Weiss; Editing by Mark Potter)", "For artist Tom Forrestall, buying a Mercedes-Benz 300 SD in 1980 was his most daunting purchase since he'd acquired a five-apartment building for its studio space, three years out of art college.\n\n\"A gigantic amount of money at the time, $43,000, maybe $42,000 and change,\" Forrestall said. What he couldn't know, though, was that it would turn out to be a steal: the 300 SD has proved to be a most durable Mercedes.\n\nIts motor was derived from the five-cylinder turbo diesel that powered Daimler-Benz's sleek C-111 to multiple speed records in 1978. Tuned for the road, it was nigh indestructible.\n\nForrestall's was still like new as it rumbled into its fourth decade surpassing 230,000 km and every bit as strong as the artist's will to paint. That year, 2010, the 74-year-old Forrestall flew to Israel and produced 24 watercolours for the Atlantic Jewish Council.\n\nNow the Dartmouth, N.S.-based master of magic realism has assured the 300 SD's perpetuity by painting the car itself. It was on exhibit at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, N.B., recently along with 40 sketches that mapped Forrestall's vision. A national tour is in the planning stages. Some day, he hopes, his car will appear at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nHow this came about has all to do with the difficulty a man can encounter in letting go - and how a woman can put the skids to such reluctance.\n\n\"We were trying to get the garage cleared for a variety of reasons,\" Forrestall's companion, Mary O'Regan, said in a telephone interview, \"and the challenge was, his car was in there, on stilts [meaning jack stands, on which the car had wintered every year since its purchase].\n\n\"One of my interests is attachment theory,\" continued the York university professor of child psychology, \"so for this particular attachment, a reason had to be found for Tom to realize the car needed to be removed. Mice! I said mice would be nesting in the glove box.\"\n\nForrestall nibbled at that cheese, the trap snapped shut. Soon the car not only was removed, Forrestall heard himself saying the time had come to sell: really, he'd not driven it since buying a new E350 wagon in 2011.\n\nThe Kijiji ad had no sooner appeared than attachment blossomed anew. He remembered: All those summer drives from Dartmouth to the 200-year-old farm house at Annapolis Royal; how his late wife, Natalie, had convinced him that $43,000 wasn't too much to spend on a car; cold winter mornings when he'd boost the 300 SD's big battery and start the car as it stood on its jack stands for its continuing well-being.\n\n\"Then I said, 'Why don't you paint it and keep it as your logo car,'\" O'Regan said. \"Tom didn't miss a beat, he said, 'I'll paint the seasons.' And thinking of Sir Thomas More, who was known as A Man For All Seasons, I suggested we name it A Car For All Seasons.\"\n\nWithin months, Mercedes-Benz Canada both bought the car and commissioned the work. O'Regan calls it serendipity that she told another artist, Janne Reuss, about Forrestall's project, and Reuss happens to be married to Tim Reuss, president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Canada. Beyond that, the O'Regan family has been selling cars since 1915, and in 2006 bought the Halifax Mercedes-Benz dealership from which Forrestall had purchased his 300 SD. \"Truly, Mary was the key to all this coming together,\" he said. \"If I'd called Mercedes-Benz with the idea, they might have told me to get lost.\"\n\nHe painted the car over the winter of 2014 in the showroom of O'Regan Mercedes-Benz in Halifax, using 15 colours of auto paint supplied by BASF, the German company that provided the car's original silver grey. Customers in for an oil change were invited to add a blade of grass, a snow flake.\n\nNow, as Beaverbrook gallery visitors view the completed work, a snowstorm has blanketed the 300 SD's trunk. Ah, but winter gets short shrift in Forrestall's panorama. A mirror strategically placed overhead by exhibition curator Nick Webb reveals spring giving way to summer on the roof, then blooming on the hood over the trusty diesel, lush green wild flowers and fiddleheads. Autumn's blowing leafs cascade rearward along the doors, back toward winter.\n\nPortraits of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler, as well as Mercedes Jellinek, daughter of the Austrian importer who insisted her name be added, appear among the flora as a tribute to the project's patron. Still, there can be no doubting, wherever the car's touring may take it, the 300 SD's real ownership. It's Tom Forrestall's, has been since 1980 and forever more.", "* Nokia leads tech selloff after telecoms profit miss\n\nLONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - European equity indexes fell for a third straight day on Thursday, weighed down by a selloff in technology stocks after disappointing numbers from Nokia and by a strengthening euro.\n\nShares in the Finnish firm fell 8.6 percent after it posted quarterly profits well below forecasts at its main telecom network equipment business, citing lower software sales, higher costs and challenging conditions in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"It came as a surprise to many because Nokia's business mix was supposed to be a bit better than this,\" Evli Bank analyst Mikko Ervasti said.\n\n\"It looks like has Nokia had to make quite a lot of very basic network implementation, which is quite a costly business that yields better results later when those networks get their upgrades.\"\n\nSector peer Alcatel Lucent dropped 8 percent while Ericsson was down 1.2 percent and the broader STOXX Europe 600 tech index fell 1.9 percent.\n\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of European shares traded 0.7 percent lower at 1,569.18 points by 0756 GMT, partly supported by strong results at insulin maker Novo Nordisk and chemical firm BASF.\n\nThe index has fallen 3.8 percent over the previous two sessions, depressed by disappointing U.S. consumer confidence and output data, which curbed growth expectations for Europe's largest trading partner and boosted the euro against the dollar.\n\nA widespread bout of profit taking on European shares, which are still up 14.7 percent this year, even took a toll on companies that reported better-than-expected results.\n\nFrench bank BNP Paribas, Novo Nordisk, Norwegian oil firm Statoil and chemical firm BASF were between flat and down 2.6 percent despite beating consensus expectations with their quarterly reports.\n\nWith just over a third of European earnings releases out by Wednesday, 61 percent of companies had met or beaten expectations, StarMine data showed.\n\nInvestors were awaiting euro zone inflation data for April at 0900 GMT for confirmation that Europe's own nascent economic recovery remained on track.", "Shares in the Finnish firm fell 8.6 percent after it posted quarterly profits well below forecasts at its main telecom network equipment business, citing lower software sales, higher costs and challenging conditions in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"It came as a surprise to many because Nokia's business mix was supposed to be a bit better than this,\" Evli Bank analyst Mikko Ervasti said.\n\n\"It looks like has Nokia had to make quite a lot of very basic network implementation, which is quite a costly business that yields better results later when those networks get their upgrades.\"\n\nSector peer Alcatel Lucent dropped 8 percent while Ericsson was down 1.2 percent and the broader STOXX Europe 600 tech index fell 1.9 percent.\n\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of European shares traded 0.7 percent lower at 1,569.18 points by 0756 GMT, partly supported by strong results at insulin maker Novo Nordisk and chemical firm BASF.\n\nThe index has fallen 3.8 percent over the previous two sessions, depressed by disappointing U.S. consumer confidence and output data, which curbed growth expectations for Europe's largest trading partner and boosted the euro against the dollar.\n\nA widespread bout of profit taking on European shares, which are still up 14.7 percent this year, even took a toll on companies that reported better-than-expected results.\n\nFrench bank BNP Paribas, Novo Nordisk, Norwegian oil firm Statoil and chemical firm BASF were between flat and down 2.6 percent despite beating consensus expectations with their quarterly reports.\n\nWith just over a third of European earnings releases out by Wednesday, 61 percent of companies had met or beaten expectations, StarMine data showed.\n\nInvestors were awaiting euro zone inflation data for April at 0900 GMT for confirmation that Europe's own nascent economic recovery remained on track.\n\nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Louise Ireland)", "European stocks declined for a third day, heading for their first monthly drop of the year, as the Federal Reserve left open the prospect of interest-rate increases even amid weak U.S. growth.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 percent to 395.19 at 8:15 a.m. in London, heading for a monthly drop of 0.5 percent.

The global value market for pesticides stood at US$54.8 billion in 2014 and is projected to reach US$81.8 billion by 2020, expected to register a CAGR of 6.95% between 2015 and 2020.\n\nFactors driving the markets for pesticides include decreasing arable land, increasing population and the requirement of improving crop yields. On the other hand, regulatory authorities such as EPA (Environment Protection Agency) frequently come up with stringent laws related to curbing pesticide use for alleviating environmental damage and increasing consumer awareness about pesticide consumption, which is expected to be instrumental in slowing down growth in demand for synthetic pesticides.\n\nIn addition, several highly toxic pesticides have either been banned or are in the process of being phased out, thereby opening new avenues for growth in demand for Biopesticides. For instance, chemicals such as glyphosate (herbicide), atrazine (herbicide) and chlorpyrifos (insecticide), to name a few, remain under constant reviews and can be either gradually phased out or even banned if more eco-friendly options are made available. Being organic, free of chemical residues and eco-friendly products, Biopesticides have been witnessing faster growth in demand compared to their synthetic counterparts.\n\nRequest a free sample from the study for comprehensive analysis: http://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-crop-protection-chemicals-pesticides-market-industry\n\nGovernments in several countries have come up with initiatives aimed at promoting the development and use of Biopesticides because of their low toxicity, greater safety and higher effectiveness in controlling pests. However, growth in the market has also been hampered due to the entrenched pesticides market, low per capita usage of pesticides in several regions, shrinking farm lands, and burgeoning research and development costs.\n\nSynthetic Pesticides covered in this report are classified into Herbicides, Insecticides, Fungicides and Other Synthetic Pesticides, while categories of Biopesticides include Bioherbicides, Bioinsecticides, Biofungicides and Other Biopesticides. The report also analyzes the global market for Pesticides by application area, including Crop-Based Applications (Grains & Cereals, Oilseeds and Fruits & Vegetables) and Non-Crop-Based Applications (Turf & Ornamental Grass and Other Applications). Synthetic pesticides dominate the global scenario in terms of volume consumption and value demand, though Biopesticides are slated to register faster growth in both these parameters over the 2014-2020 analysis period. By application area, crop-based end-uses of pesticides are likely to maintain the fastest growth in terms of volume consumed and value demand during the similar period, and retain the leading raking in terms of largest application area.\n\nBrowse more information on the report and an in-depth table of contents: http://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-crop-protection-chemicals-pesticides-market-industry\n\nDespite being the largest market for Pesticides, demand growth in North America is likely to be the slowest, while Asia-Pacific is expected to emerge as the fastest growing market. Asia-Pacific is forecast to be the fastest growing, with a 2015-2020 volume CAGR of 7.9%. US, China, Japan and Taiwan have the highest per capita (Kg/ha) usage of pesticides when compared to low consumption in countries like India, Greece among others. However, the need for food security and better reforms will drive the market in these countries.\n\nSubscribe to free alerts or browse our comprehensive literature on Agrochemicals: http://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/agriculture/agrochemicals\n\nMajor companies covered in the report include American Vanguard, Arysta LifeScience, BASF SE, Bayer CropScience, BioWorks, Cheminova, Chemtura Corp, Chr Hansen, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, FMC Corp, Isagro SpA, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Makhteshim Agan, Marrone Bio Innovations, Monsanto, Natural Industries, Novozymes A/S, Nufarm Ltd, Sumitomo Chemical, Syngenta AG and Valent Biosciences.\n\nAbout Mordor Intelligence\n\nMordor Intelligence is a global market research and consulting firm offering in-depth market analysis reports and consulting services.

Brown is a decorated combat veteran who served for 15 years in the Marine Corps and completed 7 tours of combat in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom before retiring from active duty in October of 2014. During his tenure in the military, Mr. Brown received over a dozen medals and commendations for his dedication and service to our country. Now, Brown is bringing his military experience, work ethic and talents into the board room at ALG.\n\n\"I am very excited about my new career opportunity with ALG and ready to utilize the leadership principles and traits that I learned in the Marine Corps in a corporate capacity,\" stated Mr. Brown.\n\nALG sought out the services of Brown with an eye towards helping war veterans integrate successfully into the corporate world soon after they return home. The firm identified Brown as a perfect candidate to accomplish such goal. Now, Brown works directly with ALG's managing partner, Ben Solomon, and is spearheading the firm's advertising, marketing and publicity campaigns.\n\n\"We are very pleased to haveAndre Brown join Association Law Group and are confident in his abilities,\" stated Ben Solomon, managing partner of ALG. \"It is an honor and a privilege to work with someone like Andre who has sacrificed so much for our country and the freedoms we all enjoy,\" stated Solomon. \"We hope that other law firms will follow in our path of hiring war veterans who are returning home after their service to our country ends,\" added ALG senior partner, Michael A.

Stagnant wages and rising costs of living are squeezing household budgets to their limits. In many communities, new jobs are scarce for those looking. It has been the slowest economic recovery in our lifetime.\n\nIt is critical that we work together in order to make the changes needed to strengthen and grow our economy. We need to do more to encourage job creation, which will put more Americans back to work and revive our sluggish economy.\n\nThese proposed trade partnerships are critical to upholding America's role within the global economy. For decades, America was the top recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) - the term used to describe whenever a foreign company like Honda, BASF, Novo Nordisk or Nestle decides to establish operations in the United States. Now more than ever, global companies have options on where to invest, and many are choosing to create jobs in countries other than the United States. Last year, China became the largest recipient of FDI, pushing the United States to the third position, behind Hong Kong.\n\nForeign companies employ more than 5.8 million Americans, pay 33 percent higher wages than the economy-wide average and support 18 percent of America's manufacturing jobs. Most importantly, 90 percent of all global investment that flows into the United States comes from T-TIP- and TPP-based companies. Approving TPA so that we can finalize these two agreements could significantly benefit our economy by increasing global investment in America.\n\nAccording to research recently published by the Organization for International Investment, if both agreements were implemented, more than 1.4 million new American jobs would be created as a result of increased global investment. The trade partnerships would spur a direct impact of more than 400,000 new jobs at T-TIP- and TPP-based companies operating in the United States. The industry getting the biggest job boost would be the manufacturing sector, followed by the wholesale and retail trade sector, and the professional and business services sector.\n\nMore than 455,000 additional jobs would be created at U.S. companies that are suppliers to these FDI companies. As global companies establish and grow their American presence, their purchases from U.S. suppliers will also expand, causing those suppliers to hire more American workers to meet the increased demand. The professional and business services sector, manufacturing and other services industries would see the largest job gains.\n\nIn addition, nearly 575,000 additional jobs would be created when U.S. workers hired by global employers and U.S. suppliers spend their income in local communities across the country. These sectors include education and health services, wholesale and retail trade and leisure and hospitality industries.\n\nA common misunderstanding about trade is its relationship with job creation. Some ask: Why should international trade be a priority when so many Americans here at home are struggling to find work? The answer is simple - T-TIP and TPP will not only open markets for U.S. made goods, they will encourage global investors to create jobs in America.\n\nIn my home state, global investment already plays an important role in the economy, employing 224,000 Ohioans. That's about five percent of the private sector workforce. More than 1,000 foreign companies that insource jobs in the U.S., have a presence in Ohio, playing a vital role in our state's economy.\n\nPassing TPA and approving T-TIP and TPP will do even more to strengthen the economy in our states, and across the nation. Implementation of the T-TIP and TPP trade agreements will trigger a surge of increased foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy.\n\nPassing TPA and strong, balanced trade agreements is crucial to America's future economic well-being - we need to ensure that the United States remains a global force in the world's economy. Congress should act quickly to create opportunities for hardworking Americans.", "Syngenta, Bayer, Dow, BASF Retain Leadership in Global Market\n\nIndiana Ag Connection - 05/01/2015\n\nMordor Intelligence announces its publication of the 2015 updated version of their report Global Crop Protection Chemicals (Pesticides) Market - Growth, Trends And Forecasts (2015 - 2020).\n\nAccording to the comprehensive report on crop protection chemicals, the global volume market for pesticides is projected to reach 3.4 million tons by 2020 from 2.3 million tons in 2014, with a CAGR for volume growth being 6.2% between 2015 and 2020. The global value market for pesticides stood at US$54.8 billion in 2014 and is projected to reach US$81.8 billion by 2020, expected to register a CAGR of 6.95% between 2015 and 2020.\n\nFactors driving the markets for pesticides include decreasing arable land, increasing population and the requirement of improving crop yields. On the other hand, regulatory authorities such as EPA (Environment Protection Agency) frequently come up with stringent laws related to curbing pesticide use for alleviating environmental damage and increasing consumer awareness about pesticide consumption, which is expected to be instrumental in slowing down growth in demand for synthetic pesticides.\n\nIn addition, several highly toxic pesticides have either been banned or are in the process of being phased out, thereby opening new avenues for growth in demand for Biopesticides. For instance, chemicals such as glyphosate (herbicide), atrazine (herbicide) and chlorpyrifos (insecticide), to name a few, remain under constant reviews and can be either gradually phased out or even banned if more eco-friendly options are made available. Being organic, free of chemical residues and eco-friendly products, Biopesticides have been witnessing faster growth in demand compared to their synthetic counterparts.\n\nGovernments in several countries have come up with initiatives aimed at promoting the development and use of Biopesticides because of their low toxicity, greater safety and higher effectiveness in controlling pests. However, growth in the market has also been hampered due to the entrenched pesticides market, low per capita usage of pesticides in several regions, shrinking farm lands, and burgeoning research and development costs.\n\nSynthetic Pesticides covered in this report are classified into Herbicides, Insecticides, Fungicides and Other Synthetic Pesticides, while categories of Biopesticides include Bioherbicides, Bioinsecticides, Biofungicides and Other Biopesticides. The report also analyzes the global market for Pesticides by application area, including Crop-Based Applications (Grains & Cereals, Oilseeds and Fruits & Vegetables) and Non-Crop-Based Applications (Turf & Ornamental Grass and Other Applications). Synthetic pesticides dominate the global scenario in terms of volume consumption and value demand, though Biopesticides are slated to register faster growth in both these parameters over the 2014-2020 analysis period. By application area, crop-based end-uses of pesticides are likely to maintain the fastest growth in terms of volume consumed and value demand during the similar period, and retain the leading raking in terms of largest application area.\n\nDespite being the largest market for Pesticides, demand growth in North America is likely to be the slowest, while Asia-Pacific is expected to emerge as the fastest growing market. Asia-Pacific is forecast to be the fastest growing, with a 2015-2020 volume CAGR of 7.9%. US, China, Japan and Taiwan have the highest per capita (Kg/ha) usage of pesticides when compared to low consumption in countries like India, Greece among others. However, the need for food security and better reforms will drive the market in these countries.\n\nMajor companies covered in the report include American Vanguard, Arysta LifeScience, BASF SE, Bayer CropScience, BioWorks, Cheminova, Chemtura Corp, Chr Hansen, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, FMC Corp, Isagro SpA, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Makhteshim Agan, Marrone Bio Innovations, Monsanto, Natural Industries, Novozymes A/S, Nufarm Ltd, Sumitomo Chemical, Syngenta AG and Valent Biosciences.\n\nSend this article to a friend", "Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/g46659/global) has announced the addition of the \"Global Nitrobenzene Market by Application (Aniline and Others), by Geography - Analysis and Forecast to 2019\" report to their offering.\n\nThe global nitrobenzene market was estimated at $8,219.1 million in 2014 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.9% from 2014 to 2019.

It does nothing to slow the growth of grass, so you have to mow anyhow. The most you would save is mowing once or twice a year. The impact on the environment is not worth it because the residue of spray will end up in the nearest lake or stream especially after the first rain.\n\nThe state just passed laws restricting farmers in the Sandusky River watershed from spreading manure or fertilizer on frozen ground. This was done to help control the algae bloom on Lake Erie. Spraying instead of mowing in Jefferson Township, as well as most of Crawford County, will impact Lake Erie because most of it is in the Lake Erie watershed. If the township and county spray, the largest effect will be on Lake Galion, Lowe-Volk Park, the Sandusky River and the two lakes on Lower Leesville Road.\n\nFriends of Lowe-Volk Park as well as our other parks in the county should be concerned because you will get water from the south from County Road 35 and Allens Run, from the north you get water from Leesville Road, both go into the Sandusky River that runs through Lowe-Volk Park. Lake Galion will get water from Middletown Road and County Road 35.\n\nIf you are concerned about what is going on in your townships or county engineers, Jefferson Township will meet at 7 p.m. April 27. If you are concerned, please attend. The herbicide that was used last year was Plateau by BASF Company. What they intend to use this year is Opensight by the Dow Company.

Syngenta, which has a market value of about 29 billion Swiss Francs ($31 billion), has concerns about a combination, which would face antitrust hurdles, the people said, and the companies may fail to reach an agreement, they said.\n\nCombined with Syngenta, Monsanto would become the largest player in the world for both seeds and crop chemicals and a formidable competitor to Bayer AG, BASF SE and Dow Chemical Co. Basel-based Syngenta is the world's largest maker of crop chemicals whereas St. Louis-based Monsanto is the largest maker of seeds and dominates the global market for genetically modified crops like corn and soybeans.\n\nMonsanto jumped as much as 3.6 percent in afterhours trading, after closing at $113.96 in New York, giving the company a market value of $54 billion. A spokeswoman for Monsanto declined to comment, while a representative for Syngenta had no immediate comment when reached by phone.\n\nEarlier Effort\n\nThe companies held preliminary talks last year with advisers about a combination, before Syngenta's management decided against negotiations, people familiar with the matter said at the time. No agreement was made after concerns were raised about the strategic fit, antitrust issues and relocating the company.\n\nTo address antitrust issues, Monsanto has planned for a deal that would include a sale of portions of the combined business, one of the people said Thursday. The U.S. company last year reached out to potential bidders of those assets, including Bayer, this person said.\n\nA spokesman for Bayer said the company doesn't comment on rumors or speculation.\n\nSeed Probes\n\nMonsanto's dominance in the seed industry was the subject of U.S. antitrust probes at the federal and state levels a few years ago. The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division dropped its probe into possible anti-competitive practices in the seed industry in 2012, and a month later at least seven states led by Iowa ended their five-year investigation without taking action.\n\nOpposition to genetically modified crops led BASF SE in 2012 to announce a relocation to the U.S. from Germany of the plant-science division that develops such crops.\n\nDuring the talks last year, a purchase of Syngenta was -- in part -- viewed as an opportunity for Monsanto to move its tax location to Switzerland, where corporate tax rates are lower than in the U.S. Such deals, known as inversions, have since come under increased scrutiny from U.S. legislators, and it's not certain that any revived offer would be structured to move Monsanto's official address."]}, "Apple": {"2015-04-29": ["Apple Inc limited availability of the Apple Watch after a key component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe component, called the taptic engine, produces the sensation of being tapped on the wrist, the newspaper reported.\n\nApple declined to comment on the story.\n\nApple has not given any sales figures for its hotly anticipated Apple Watch since it began taking orders this month.

A simple word, one that is out there almost before you know you've said it, and yet I choke on it. Not my parents. They relished saying no. Is it generational? I don't know. But I do know that the advent of smartphones -- and with them the never-ceasing can we get this app question - has shown me to be a traitor to my own Spartan upbringing.\n\nSpeaking of smartphones, a word about artificial intelligence. Everywhere you go, all you hear is that robots are taking over. Doctor, lawyer, journalist - no profession is safe from the long arm of the algorithm. Breathless talk of the coming day of singularity, when artificial intelligence will surpass all human knowledge.\n\nHere's why everyone should relax. First, just look at your vacuum cleaner. Do you really see him in your pipe and slippers, flipping through the current issue of Salt Water Sportsman? Me neither. And second, if machines will truly be like us, then they'll be like us in all respects. Smart? Yes, but also, petty, vindictive, selfish and, ultimately, lazy. Just as soon as they have the conn, they'll outsource everything right back to us. So we'll again be sitting in a seventh floor cube farm in accounts payable, wondering why the new receptionist always seems to notice Chet's cologne but never mine, and the machines will go back to being pencil sharpeners, calculators and whatnot. Circle of life.\n\nBut back to smartphone apps. At first the novelty of them made me indulgent. I suspect many parents acted this way. It was amazing what the boys at Apple had enabled. I started rationalizing, coming up with nobler and nobler justifications. With these apps I am arming my children with weaponry necessary to contend in a digital future.\n\nNow I realize they were just playing me, showing me only the apps they wanted me to see, like Vocab-Master. Visions of perfect SAT scores, early admissions and valedictory addresses rich with T.S. Eliot references clouded my judgment. But then they made the classic blunder of overplaying their hand. App or no app, no adolescent uses the words stevedore or meretricious as often as they were. I knew they were up to something. It soon dawned on me that for every app designed to raise one's IQ, there were an equal number of irretrievably stupid ones, like Rhymes with Cat, that they had downloaded, and these were the ones being used when I wasn't around. It's just 99 cents was compelling for a while, but not when asked twice a day, month after month. One day I looked in the mirror and didn't like the face staring back at me: I had become a yes-man to my kids.\n\nAnd so I recalled the example of my parents. A duke and duchess of dashing hopes, they were. And not afraid to discipline. Mom could answer truthfully that she didn't believe in spanking, but this was only because she found the head-knuckle much more effective. Dad so frequently meted out arm punches - tattoos as they were innocently called - for real and perceived transgressions that sometimes he got ahead of himself in the count. Rather than apologize, he'd just say \"that's for something bad that you'll do later.\"", "Later this year, Microsoft Corp could allow apps from competitor Google's Android operating system onto its own Windows phones. On Wednesday, this information was given by two sources familiar with the matter. This move by Microsoft indicates a major shift for the company. The world's biggest software company has been putting efforts to attract users but has managed to grab only 3% of the global smartphone market.\n\nAccording to Strategy Analytics, Samsung's Android phones cover 81% of the market and Apple Inc has 15% of the market. It has been anticipated that Microsoft will announce regarding the move at its developer conference in San Francisco later on Wednesday.\n\nThis summer, the company also has plans to release its new Windows 10 operating system. The operating system is planned to run across PCs, tablets and phones. The PC market is still dominated by the company. However, it hasn't succeeded when it comes to tablets and phones, to a certain extent as a result of a lack of apps.\n\nThis move of allowing Android apps onto its phones and tablets could come out as an important step taken to achieve that. However, it could also lead to the risk of making Windows phones less preferred if they are just seen as emulations of Android devices.\n\nAccording to Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC, \"Their approach recognizes that code for a mobile app can start from any of a number of sources. The only approach to succeed today is to recognize the multiple developer ecosystems out there\". In late morning trading on Nasdaq, Microsoft shares fell 0.5% at $48.9.", "Microsoft Microsoft is trying to reboot its mobile mojo -- yet again -- with a little help from the PC and a big assist from the folks who build the apps that run on its devices.\n\nIn an effort to court those developers, including many who have been lured by the larger opportunity offered by Apple's Apple's iOS and Google's Google's Android, Microsoft promised that its new operating system, Windows 10, will run on one billion devices in the next two to three years.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive developer platform ever,\" Terry Myerson, Microsoft's executive vice president of operating, said during a keynote at the company's Build conference for software developers. Windows 10 is expected to ship later this year.\n\nThe goal is attainable, especially when counting PCs, where Microsoft remains a powerhouse, said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead, president of Moore Insights and Strategy. Windows 10 will be able to run on the millions of PCs that currently run Windows 7 or Windows 8, and it will be pre-loaded into some 300 million new PCs that will ship in this year, according to estimates.\n\n\"Microsoft is trying to impress upon developers that it's bigger than iOS and Android. They have a much larger footprint,\" said Moorhead.\n\nOf course, it is in the mobile world where Microsoft is suffering, as Windows Phones account for a tiny fraction of the smartphone market. Microsoft is trying to get around that problem by erasing the lines between the mobile and PC world. The linchpin of that approach are Windows 10's universal apps, which will work any sized device, from phones to PCs and even the Xbox One game console and HoloLens, the company's new augmented reality device. Universal apps are intended to simplify life for the developers, who will be able to create one version of their software for all devices that use Microsoft's operating system-although there will be some additional coding necessary for transferring apps to Xbox and HoloLens.\n\nMicrosoft's boldest new move to resurrect its mobile fortunes was its announcement that iOS and Android developers will be able to use the same code to create version Windows versions of their apps. The move should drastically increase the number of apps that run on Windows phones.\n\nDevelopers still have to do some work to convert their apps. King Digital Entertainment has already used the iOS code for its hugely popular Candy Crush to create a Windows 10 app. Microsoft also showed off an Android version of the Choice Hotels app working on a Windows phone.\n\nMicrosoft's Biggest Hits And Flops\n\n\"Everybody thought hell would freeze over before Microsoft would do something like that,\" said Moorhead, referring to Microsoft opening up its development platform. \"It convinces everybody that Microsoft is in it to win it. They're willing to put all their sacrificial lambs out there. They're willing to do what it takes to thrive in a cloud and mobile world.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also making it easy for developers to move their older Windows applications -- those built on .Net and Win32 -- as well as Web apps written in Javascript to Windows 10.\n\nTo make developing for Windows more appealing, Microsoft will integrate its Windows Store and its artificial intelligence assistant Cortana more deeply in Windows 10. Windows 10 users will be able to control apps straight from the home screen using Cortana. For example, a user could communicate with a friend through the messaging app Viber by just commanding Cortana. The Windows Store will collect information about which apps you use and how you use them and then suggest other apps you might be interested in straight from the Start menu.\n\nMicrosoft is also working hard to make Windows 10 phones easier to use, especially in emerging markets. The company announced at Build that it will allow carrier billing in its Windows Store, so users will be able to buy apps using the mobile number rather than having to enter their credit card. That will be appealing to the millions of smartphone phone users in developing countries who don't have credits cards, said Myerson. Microsoft said 90 mobile operators around the world will support this carrier billing with the company.\n\n\"Windows 10 represents a new generation of Windows built for an era of more personal computing,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the conference. \"The mobility of the experience is what matters, not the mobility of the device.\"\n\nFollow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com", "For the first time since 2011, Apple has made more money from selling desktops and notebooks than iPads. So does this mean the PC is making a comeback?\n\nEver since Steve Jobs walked onto the stage of the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts on Jan 27, 2010 and introduced the first iPad to the world, analysts have been talking about the death of the PC.\n\nAnd while the tablet's popularity exploded at a rate never before experienced in the history of consumer electronics - Gartner claims 229 million were sold in 2014 alone - sales are not only cooling, it looks as if the computer might actually be making a comeback.\n\nIn amongst the numbers regarding huge iPhone sales and information about being swamped with demand for its first smartwatch, Apple's latest quarterly earning figures show that its computer sales are also up - considerably.\n\nApple sold 4.6 million Macs over the last three months - a 10% year-on-year increase - and those figures only run to the end of March, meaning that they don't include sales of its latest notebooks, which didn't go on sale until April 10.\n\nThe company sold 12.3 million iPads over the same period but, for the first time since 2011, Apple has made more in revenues from its PCs than from its tablets.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple doesn't differentiate between notebook and desktop sales when presenting its figures, but the signs suggest its portable PCs are seeing a boost in popularity.\n\nAccording to Digitimes' Asian supply chain sources, notebook shipments are expected to grow 11% over the next quarter and this upturn is being driven by demand for MacBooks and Google's Chromebooks.\n\nThe publication's own research, published ahead of Apple's figures, correctly forecast higher Mac sales and even Gartner, whose latest report into the state of the PC industry - published on April 9 - is positive about notebooks, convertibles and hybrid computers, despite painting a grim picture for the immediate future of the desktop.\n\n\"PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality. Our early study suggests strong growth of hybrid notebooks, especially in mature markets, in 1Q15,\" said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner.\n\nAs well as the re-emergence of the notebook, 2015 could still also be the year that the tablet gets a new lease on life.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple is developing a larger, productivity-focused tablet - that the press has dubbed the iPad Pro - which is expected to boast a 12in display and offer computing power on a par with an ultrabook PC.\n\nHowever, when the company chooses to release it is anyone's guess.", "The iPhone has created something of a technological dynasty since the release of its original version back in 2007, and has been unstoppable ever since. However, with the release of new Apple Watch, it is worth examining whether or not this new Apple Inc. product has the potential to outshine the gadget that has been dominating the tech market for the past eight years.\n\nEach time a new iPhone is announced in terms of current plans to create a new model, the world goes crazy. Speculation begins immediately concerning possible new specs and features, as well as what the design will look like and how the newest model will differ from those previous overall. Indeed, even though the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were only released in September of last year, people had instantly moved on to discussion of the iPhone 7 and what could possibly be improved from the model that had just been released. The question remains as to whether or not this is simply the human nature of people wanted to move onto the next best thing as soon as possible, or rather if it has anything to do with the product itself never actually being good enough or newly innovative enough to keep the interest of those using it for more than a brief period of time.\n\nThe Apple Watch was released on April 24, and is currently available in nine countries: the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK, France, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Germany. Yesterday, several news reports stated that current CEO Tim Cook was having to set the product up for release in even more countries due to overwhelmingly popular demand, demand which Cook says is beginning to overpass the quantity currently available for shipping.\n\nSo, what makes the Apple Watch so different from the iPhone? Company honchos are referring to the product as their \"most personal product yet\", this being for one undeniable reason: it is wearable. Even though iPhone users can and usually do carry their device on their person in some manner or other, whether it be in a pocket of their clothing or in whatever carrying apparatus they are using at the time, there is often much concern regarding the misplacing or losing of the iPhone itself. Indeed, the internet contains various horror stories detailing dropped, stolen, broken, and/or lost iPhones wherein the purchaser was left upset and often angry at the situation. With a wearable device, users are far less likely to forget their product somewhere or end up having it pilfered after leaving it on a ledge or the like for even a moment. Unlike iPhones, the Apple Watch is not so heavy and easily damaged, therefore even if it is dropped it will most likely survive. These are a few reasons why this newest company product may end up outshining the iPhone.\n\nThere is also the fact that the product is, for lack of a better term, new and exciting in a way that the iPhone has not been since its first inception. The Apple Watch is simply something that people have never truly experienced before, and it cannot (yet) be compared and scrutinized with eight years worth of the same type of product. This is not to say that individuals will not eventually become bored with the idea, as they have done with the iPhone, but this new Apple product will most likely be able to outshine the iPhone for at least the first few models it produces.", "The Apple Watch is about to appear on wrists everywhere, as the Cupertino firm fights a losing battle to keep up with the huge demand for its coveted timepiece.\n\nMore than 3,000 apps were compatible with the device at launch, and iOS developers are scrambling to optimise theirs before the market becomes too crowded.\n\nWith so much choice on offer, it can be difficult to know where to begin, so we've collected all the best apps to make the most of your new wearable.\n\nWe'll update this regularly, so keep coming back to discover even more useful apps.\n\nHow to shop for an Apple Watch: 6-step guide to try-on appointments\n\nThe first Apple Watch reviews are in - 'beautiful', 'impressive', 'frustrating'\n\n1.

And yet, Amy Hess, the executive assistant director of the FBI's Science and Technology Branch, failed to clearly say exactly what the FBI wants from Apple, Google, and other companies -- once again.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on encryption technology, with the goal of discussing American law enforcement claims that new security measures by Apple and other companies might hinder investigations, and what can be done to prevent that. The FBI, as well as President Barack Obama and other government officials, are worried that the encryption used to secure data stored on a cellphone, as well as messages sent by cellphone users, could stop investigators from accessing relevant information during investigations.\n\nWhen asked directly if the FBI wants a backdoor, Hess dodged the question and did not describe in detail what actual solution the FBI is seeking.\n\n\"We are simply asking for information that we seek in response to a lawful order in a readable format,\" Hess responded, while also repeating that the Bureau supports strong encryption. \"But how that actually happens should be the decision of the provider.\"\n\nWhen pressed again, Hess said that it would be okay for the FBI not to have a key to decrypt data, if the provider \"can get us that information by maintaining the key themselves.\"\n\nThe problem, according to numerous technologist and encryption experts, is that you cannot design a secure encryption system that would allow for something like that. Because if someone has a key, or a backdoor to access supposedly encrypted data, criminals or malicious hackers can get their hands on that too.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) asked whether anyone among the witnesses believed you could build a technically secure backdoor with a \"golden key\" -- a term that's been used by some to describe a potential solution in the past -- and encouraged them to raise their hand if they did.\n\nNo one, including the FBI's Hess, as well as Daniel Conley, the Suffolk County District Attorney in Massachusetts, who denounced that mobile phones are \"the tools of terrorists\" and that encryption will help perverts and terrorists, raised their hand.\n\nTechnologists and privacy advocates quickly decried the FBI's lack of technical details when requesting a solution to what the bureau calls the \"going dark\" problem, a scenario where unbreakable encryption is so pervasive that agents don't have access to relevant data during investigations.\n\nMatt Blaze, an associate professor in computer science at Penn and a respected cybersecurity and cryptography expert, repeated that point during the hearing, saying that there's no such thing as \"security systems that can be bypassed by the good guys but that also reliably keep the bad guys out.\"\n\n\"As a technologist I can't ignore a stark reality, which is simply that it can't be done safely.\"\n\nBut, in a bizarre response, Conley complained about Blaze's and other technologists' attitude, invoking the moon race.\n\n\"Jeez I hate to hear talk like 'that cannot be done.'\" he said. \"Think about if Jack Kennedy said 'we can't go to the moon. That cannot be done.' He said something different, we're gonna get there in the next decade.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, technologists mocked Conley's weird metaphor.\n\nEven the members of the committee seemed strongly opposed to the idea of weakening encryption to help law enforcement agents get their hands on certain information.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D- Calif.), who described himself as a recovering computer scientist major, said that \"creating a pathway for decryption only for good guys is technologically stupid.\"", "Book review: Jake Halpern's Bad Paper: Chasing Debt from Wall Street to the Underworld is a page-turner.

Apple declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif., tech company is rushing to boost inventory of the watch, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said Monday in an interview. \"We are working very, very hard to catch up from a supply standpoint -- keep in mind this is not only a new product but it's an entirely new category,\" he said.\n\nTests of the watch found a reliability issue with the part made by AAC Technologies Holdings, one of the two suppliers for the taptic engine, the newspaper said. Parts from the second supplier, Nidec, weren't having the same issues.\n\nThe introduction of the watch, which has a touch-screen display and works in tandem with a user's iPhone, has been in stark contrast to typical rollouts of Apple products, when buyers have lined up outside stores for the chance to get the new devices on the first day.\n\nAngela Ahrendts, Apple's retail chief, had told employees that tight inventory and high demand meant the watch initially wouldn't be available for sale in company stores and urged workers to send shoppers online to make a purchase.\n\nCustomers have been able to schedule demonstrations in Apple's stores since April 10, when online preorders began. Shipment times quickly pushed past the official release date of April 24, with some customers promised delivery as late as June, depending on the version of the watch they purchased. Apple has sent messages to some buyers that their orders would be shipped earlier than expected.\n\nA snafu with the watch's components would follow a supplier issue with Apple's larger-screened iPhone 6 and 6 Plus introduced last year. The phones were expected to have display screens made of sapphire, but Apple's supplier GT Advanced couldn't meet the requirements. The supplier filed for bankruptcy in October.\n\nThe new iPhones without the extra tough screens went on to fuel record sales globally, helping boost revenue in China by more than 70 percent last quarter.", "Apple Inc limited availability of the Apple Watch after a key component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe component, called the taptic engine, produces the sensation of being tapped on the wrist, the newspaper reported.\n\nApple declined to comment on the story.\n\nApple has not given any sales figures for its hotly anticipated Apple Watch since it began taking orders this month.

After running some tests, Apple found that the Taptic Engines from AAC Technologies in Shenzhen, China \"started to break down over time.\" This caused Apple to discard assembled Apple Watches with the faulty Taptic Engines, which has ultimately bottlenecked the rollout of the wearable.\n\nIt is said that Apple will be employing Foxconn as another assembler, in addition to Quanta Computer, to ease supply constraints. Foxconn won't be ready to go until late 2015 at best, which points to a potential supply issue for the holiday season.\n\nMeanwhile, many who preordered an Apple Watch are still waiting. However, Apple is making progress on the orders, with many shipping sooner than the initial shipment dates.

Samsung has reclaimed the top spot from Apple, which briefly gained the lead during its iPhone 6 launch.\n\nSamsung is on a roll right now. The company is basking in the success of its latest smartphone duo, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, which are an undisputed success. The company expects to sell more than 70 million of the handsets, and has even had to commission an entire new factory in order to meet demand for the S6 Edge, which is currently exceeding supply and finding frustrated consumers unable to get their hands on the unique dual sided curved display handset.\n\nApple has been similarly successful in creating demand for its latest phone flagship iPhones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The launch of the two handsets last September was an unprecedented success for the company, and the two phones just exceeded sales expectations for the quarter and sent stock in the company shooting up to record highs.\n\nSamsung, however, has toppled Apple from the top spot in terms of volume of smartphone sales for the first quarter 2015 period, regaining its former lead, which it lost to Apple during the IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch period. Samsung's shipments of smartphones worldwide totaled 83.2 million, giving it a 24 percent market share as opposed to Apple's 18 percent market share. What makes the showing more impressive is that the results don't account for most of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge sales, except perhaps for some preorders, which took place in the first quarter.\n\nResearch firm Strategy Analytics reported the results. \"Samsung continued to face challenges in Asia and elsewhere, but its global performance has stabilized sufficiently well this quarter to overtake Apple and recapture first position as the world's largest smartphone vendor by volume,\" stated Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston.", "Chinese brand Xiaomi Inc topped the league table in the world's biggest smartphone market with 12.8 percent of the 110 million units shipped, followed closely by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at 12.3 percent and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, another Chinese player, at 10.2 percent, the data showed.\n\nStrategy Analytics declined to say how many handsets Samsung had shipped in China during the quarter, although it expected the South Korean company to return to the top three in the next one or two quarters following the launch of its flagship S6 and S6 edge models in April.\n\nIt expects Apple to surpass Xiaomi to top the China market later this year on the strength of its popular new iPhone 6 and 6 plus models.

This is after Apple decided to increase to production numbers in February because of the predicted demand.\n\nApple needed to destroy some of the production-finished watches with the Taptic engine defect because repairing them would prove to be more expensive rather than making new ones. The blame is most likely being put on the supplier of the engine in Shenzhen, China -- AAC Technologies.\n\nThere have been no word on whether Apple is deciding to take legal action against the said engine supplier, but PC World reports that the iPhone maker is now turning to Japanese supplier Nidec to increase their production.\n\nTaptic engines from the second supplier were not defective, well, at least most of them are not. The Apple Watch deliveries are still delayed, however, as the number of orders led to the shortage in supply. After the pre-ordering on April 10, Apple decided to ship some of the models in June, instead of the expected April release date.\n\nTo further aid in the speed of the production, Apple is reportedly finding another company that will assemble all the Apple Watch parts into a finished product. The original company that was tasked to do this was Quanta Computer from Taiwan. Foxconn, which has been a partner of Apple for years assembling their iPhones, is most likely the candidate.\n\nSome Apple Watch models are even reported to be delayed in deliveries much later than June. Add that to the new Taptic engine problem and it might take longer. What is the deal with the said engine anyway?\n\nBesides using the engine to make the Apple Watch vibrate, it is also used to simulate physical touch. It has been deployed in some of Apple's MacBook models. The Taptic engine is actually one of the key components of the Apple Watch, according to Ars Technica .\n\nThis is not the first time that there was a delay in the delivery of Apple products. For instance, some 2013 Mac Pro orders actually took several months before being delivered to the customers. In addition, if you wanted to order the new MacBook model today, it will still take more than a month before it reaches you.\n\nStill, delays like these do not stop Apple fans from being loyal to their products. Reports earlier this month are saying that Apple is on its way to having a $1 trillion valuation because of the confidence of stock holders. Their profits also soared after the launch of their newest iPhone 6 and the integration of the Apple Pay.\n\nFor those who cannot wait for the actual shipment of Apple Watches, there are some already popping up on eBay with the Edition costing up to $16,900.

For every successful piece of data storage technology, there have been dozens more that were laughably bad.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the technologies that shaped modern data storage, as well as where we go from here.\n\nFrom Punch Cards to Holograms - A Short History of Data Storage\n\nHistorical Data Storage Timeline\n\nData storage formats come and go, but the one consistent factor is Moore's law, which is the observation that over the history of computing, technology shrinks, and power doubles approximately every two years. While the original law was merely meant to speak to the ability to shove roughly twice as many transistors into an integrated circuit, the law has since been unofficially expanded to apply to technology as a whole, and its ability to (roughly) double computing power every two years.\n\nWhile we're getting to a stage that's close to \"Peak Moore's Law\" in that we're not necessarily doubling computing power nearly as fast as we were a decade or two ago, the effect still holds true to the extent that every two years we seem to barrel through a wall we previously thought impassable, or at least currently impassable.\n\nYou can see just how applicable the law is when you start to line up technologies side-by-side and realize just how far they've progressed in the form of data storage.\n\nPunch Cards (or Punched Cards) and Paper Tape (1700s)\n\nPunch cards feature heavy card stock along with a rudimentary grid pattern. Along this pattern, specific slots are \"punched\" out, which allows for easy scanning (by a computer or card reader) for data-heavy projects and tasks.\n\nWhile the punch card was first thought to have been invented in the 1700s by Jean-Baptise Falcon and Basile Bouchon as a way to control textile looms in 18th century France; modern punch cards (used for data storage) were masterminded by Herman Hollerith as a way to process census data for the upcoming 1890 United States Census.\n\nIn 1881, Hollerith - after spotting inefficiencies in the 1880 census - began work on a way to rapidly improve the speed of processing enormous amounts of data. Calculating data into usable numbers after the 1880 census took nearly eight years, and the 1890 census was estimated to take 13 years to count, due to an influx of immigrants after the last census. The idea of not having tabulated data for the previous census while they were recording the current census led the United States government to assign the Census Bureau, and Hollerith (a Census Bureau employee at the time) in particular, to find a more efficient means in which to count and record this data.\n\nAfter experimenting with two similar technologies: punch cards and paper tape (similar to the punch card, but connected for easier feeding), he ultimately decided to explore the punch card after discovering the paper tape - although easier to feed through a machine quickly - was very easy to tear which led to inaccuracies in data recording.\n\nHollerith's method was a rousing success, and after utilizing the punch card method, the 1890 census had a full count, and data graph after just one year. After his success with the 1890 census, Hollerith formed a company called Tabulating Machine Company, which was later part of a four company consolidation into one new company, known as Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR). Later, CTR was renamed and is now known as International Business Machines Corporation, or, IBM.\n\nPunch cards saw improvements in technology up until the mid-60s before they started to be phased out by modern computers that were getting cheaper, faster and more economical than utilizing punch card technology. While almost entirely phased out by the 70s, punch cards were still used for a variety of tasks, including data recorders for voting machines as recently as the 2012 election.\n\nPaper tape, on the other hand, started to show some real promise. While punch cards were still the dominant technology of the time, paper tape was used for applications in which it was better suited, and improved upon over the years until it ultimately formed the foundation for a new technology, magnetic tape.\n\nTube Storage (1946)\n\nWhen it comes to tube storage, there were only two main players: Williams-Kilburn and Selectron. Both machines were known as random access computer memory and used electrostatic cathode-ray display tubes in order to store data.\n\nThe two technologies varied slightly, but the simplest implementation used what was known as the holding beam concept. A holding beam uses three electron guns (for writing, reading and maintaining the pattern) in order to create subtle voltage variations in which to store an image (not a photo). To read the data, operators used a reading gun that scanned the storage area looking for variations in the set voltage. These changes in voltage are how the message was deciphered.\n\nThe first of these tubes was the Selectron tube, which was developed for the first time in 1946 by Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and had an initial planned production run of 200 pieces. Problems with this first series led to a delay which saw 1948 pass by while RCA still didn't have a viable product to sell to their primary customer, John von Neumann. Von Neumann intended to use the Selectron tube for his IAS machine, which was the first fully electronic computer built at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey. The primary appeal for von Neumann when selecting the RCA tube rather than the Williams-Kilburn model was due to the original Selectron's boasted memory storage of 4096 bits as opposed to Williams-Kilburn and their 1024 bit capacity.\n\nEventually, John von Neumann switched to the Williams-Kilburn model for his IAS machine after numerous production issues had caused RCA to give up on the 4096 bit concept and instead switch to the rather disappointing 256 bit version. While still used in a number of IAS-related machines, the technology was ultimately abandoned by the 50s, as magnetic-core memory became more popular, and cheaper to produce.\n\nMagnetic-core Memory (1947)\n\nOften referred to as \"core\" memory, magnetic-core technology became the gold standard of storage technology and had an impressive run of approximately 20 years as the dominant technology in computing during that era - most notably by IBM.\n\nCore memory uses magnets in order to create a grid with each intersection of the X and Y axis being an independent location responsible for storing information. Once connected to an electrical current, these gridded sections turn clockwise or counterclockwise in order to store a 0 or a 1. To read the data, the process works in reverse, and if the grid location is unaffected, the bit is read as a 0. If the grid shifts to the opposite polarity it's read as a 1.\n\nCore was the first popular type of memory available in consumer devices that used random-access technology, which we now know as RAM. At the time, random-access memory was a real game changer as the technology allowed the user to access any memory location in the same amount of time. This technology was later advanced by the introduction of semiconductor memory, which led to the RAM chips we use in our devices today.\n\nMagnetic-core memory was first patented in 1947 by amateur inventor Frederick Viehe. Additional patents filed by Harvard physicist An Wang (1949), RCA's Jan Rajchman (1950) and MIT's Jay Forrester (1951) for similar technology make the waters a bit cloudy when trying to determine who the actual inventor was. All of the patents were slightly different, but each were filed within just a few years of one another. In 1964, after years of legal battles, IBM paid MIT $13 million for the rights to use Forrester's 1951 patent. At the time, that was the largest patent-related settlement to date. They had also previously paid $500 thousand for the use of Wang's patent after a series of lawsuits due to the patent not being granted until 5 years after filing, a period of time in which Wang argued that left his intellectual property exposed to competitors.\n\nMagnetic-core memory works by representing one bit of information on each core. The cores were then magnetized either clockwise or counterclockwise, thus allowing each bit to be stored and retrieved independently by arranging the wires around the board in a way that allowed the core to be set to either a one, or a zero depending on magnetic polarity. When the electrical current powering the board was altered, it made it possible to alter the way in which the 1's and 0's were stored and retrieved.\n\nWhile the technology mostly died in the 70s it brought about the foundation of modern computing and random-access memory solutions - specifically, internal memory solutions.\n\nCompact Cassette (1963)\n\nThe compact cassette uses magnetic tape wrapped around two spools which are sheltered inside of a hard plastic container. As these spools spin, specialized recorders write data by manipulating the magnetic coding into triangular or circular patterns on the surface of the tape. When played through a tape player, two heads advance the tape at a standard speed (1.875-inches per second) and an electromagnet reads the variations in the tape data in order to create sound.\n\nMuch like magnetic-core memory, the compact cassette is also a magnetized storage solution. However, aside from both being magnetic, they differ in almost every other possible way. For one, the compact cassette doesn't utilize random access memory technology. Instead, compact cassettes - or just cassette tapes, as they're commonly known - utilize sequential memory. This means the information is stored in sequence, and it takes longer to access individual pieces depending on where they are located on the tape.\n\nThe compact cassette improved on another technology - the magnetic tape - which was used in the 1950s for audio and film recording (based on paper tape technology) and is still used today in some instances of music or film recording. The major improvements to the magnetic tape brought the size down significantly, making it more easily transportable, and more viable in consumer devices.\n\nWhile the first compact audio cassette was introduced by Phillips in 1963, it took over a decade for the format to gather any real steam. In 1979, with Sony's introduction of the Walkman, the format rose to immense popularity and stayed there for well over a decade until the CD started to come into its own in the early to mid-90s.\n\nIt's important to note that the technology behind magnetic tape, and the cassette in particular, were also responsible for another storage medium that started to gain widespread consumer acceptance around this timeframe - the VHS cassette. While magnetic tape - or cassettes - are only used in specialized and very niche applications, they did pave the way for more portable, faster, and higher quality data storage mediums.\n\nThe Floppy Disk (1960s)\n\nMuch like the cassette tape, the floppy disk uses surface manipulation of the inner magnetic disc in order to record data. When placed into a disk drive, an electromagnet looks for variations on the surface of the disk in order to recover the information contained within it.\n\nThe first floppy disks were just as their name implies, floppy. The disk itself was a piece of thin and flexible plastic designed to hold a magnetic material inside. Initially, these disks were 8-inches, before the 5 1/4-inch versions were released and then both gave way to the much smaller - and not so floppy - hard plastic 3 1/2-inch diskette (also called a floppy disk).\n\nThe earliest versions of the technology started to surface in the late 1960s before becoming a computing mainstay in the early 70s. Floppy disks relied on a FDD (floppy disk drive) in order to read the data stored on the magnetic interior of the disk. For more than two decades, the floppy disk was used as the primary readable and writable storage device for personal computers.\n\nWhile limitations on the technology started to become more apparent in the early 90s, disks were still widely used - in conjunction with compact disc drives - to provide an additional layer of support in instances in which backups or data storage were required. Even though CD technology was entering the market, and bridge technology, such as the ZIP drive was relatively common, the technology to write to a CD was still a few years off for consumers (and quite expensive). This led to personal computers being built and shipped with floppy disk drives long after they had outlived their usefulness.\n\nIn 1998, Apple introduced the iMac, which was the first commercial success in the personal computing market that didn't include a floppy disk drive. Despite the iMac's success, the floppy disk drive didn't disappear completely from consumer-grade personal computers until 2002.\n\nLaserDisc (1978)\n\nAlthough it looks similar to a DVD or CD (albeit quite a bit larger) the LaserDisc (LD) was actually quite different. LD stored audio and video in the pits and lands (grooves) on the surface of the disc through a process called pulse-width modification. Playback was accomplished through an LD player using a helium-neon laser tube in which to retrieve and decode the stored information.\n\nLaserDisc was a short-lived format that was never all that well-received by anyone but the most hardcore videophiles. However, it's an important inclusion due to the groundwork it laid for more popular optical disc formats such as CDs, DVDs, and later Blu-ray. It is important to note, however, that LaserDisc, although similar to the aforementioned technologies, wasn't digital technology. That said, it certainly offered the best analog picture and sound to quality to date.\n\nThe format itself was only used for storing audio and video, although it did have practical applications that could have - if utilized - extended to computing and other data storage mediums. While VHS and Betamax video cassettes were slugging it out for market share in the 80s, LaserDisc quietly emerged in 1978 without much fanfare.\n\nAlthough rather cumbersome in size, LD offered audio and video quality that was unmatched at the time. It was the first format of its kind that allowed users to pause images or use slow motion functions without noticeable losses in video quality. Laserdisc wasn't without its faults, however. One major drawback was having to flip the massive disc every 30 or 60 minutes (depending on the type of disc) before the even pricier players that rotated the optical pickup to the other side of the disc became popular.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the bulky and expensive players, as well as the cost of the disc itself, LD could have been a quite popular format for audio and video storage.\n\nThe format did gain slight acceptance in Japan, with approximately 10-percent of all Japanese households owning a Laserdisc player (compared to 2-percent in the US), but by the early 2000s the format was mostly dead as the smaller - and cheaper - DVD started to gain popularity.\n\nModern Data Storage Hard Disk Drive | HDD (1980s)\n\nThe HDD records data on a thin ferromagnetic material on the surface of a spinning platter. Data is by written by rapidly changing sequential binary bits to the surface of the platter. The data is then read from the disk by detecting these transitions in the surface magnetization in the form of 1s and 0s.\n\nIntroduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs started as devices that were about the size of a washing machine, with less storage than three 3.5-inch floppies (3.75 Megabytes of total storage vs. 4.32 Megabytes on the three floppy disks). Needless to say, it wasn't really a viable option for most practical purposes, and in the sense of modern computing we didn't begin to see the HDD in consumer-grade computers until the late 1980s. While the technology was small enough to fit in modern computers by the early 80s, the cost was still prohibitive for most consumers.\n\nThe drives themselves work by using a flat cylindrical device that looks a lot like a CD. The device - called a \"platter\" - holds recorded data by writing to the disk using sequential changes in the direction of magnetization in order to store data as binary bits on a thin layer of ferromagnetic material covering the outside of the platter.\n\nThese bits are read by spinning the platter and reading the transitions in the magnetization in order to form a clear picture, in binary, of what is stored on the drive. HDDs are another example of random-access memory, as they are capable of recalling data written anywhere on the strip of ferromagnetic material (on top of the platter) in about the same amount of time no matter where they are located.\n\nOver the years, technology improved allowing the platter to spin faster, thus reading and writing information more quickly. Initial consumer HDDs offered a speed of 1,200 RPMs, while standard speeds on modern HDDs are typically 5,400 or 7,200 RPM. Hard disk drives can spin at up to 15,000 RPMs on the most high-performance servers although this is still rather rare.\n\nModern drives are moving away from platter-based technology in favor of flash memory. Flash memory - or SSD (solid state drive) are faster, more reliable than a traditional HDD, and consume less power. That said, HDDs still dominate the market due to a lower price point.\n\nCompact Disc (1979)\n\nCDs use a similar technology as LaserDisc, only in a digital format. Much like LD, information is stored within the pits and lands of a disc. Instead of analog data, this data is written in a series of 1s and 0s. To read the data within the pits and lands of the disc, a laser reads the coded information by measuring the size and distance between the bits.\n\nThe term \"compact disc\" (or CD) was coined by Phillips and worked in conjunction with Sony to deliver a format that could ultimately replace the cassette tape as the next generation of audio storage and playback technology in 1979. The format became an international standard in 1987 although consumer use of the CD wasn't popular until the early 1990s. CDs quickly moved past audio-only storage and were later adapted to store data (CD-ROM), as well as video, images, or even entire computer or console games through a wide variety of disc types.\n\nBy the mid-90s the CD was the most popular data storage means in the world, and by 2000 it had surpassed the cassette tape as the most popular method of storing audio files. As consumers adopted the technology, the format quickly moved past audio-only storage and was later adapted to store data (CD-ROM), as well as video, images, or even entire computer or console games.\n\nAlso of note, this is one of the first modern technologies since the audiocassette that allowed users not only read access but the ability to write to the disc with relatively inexpensive and consumer-targeted writeable drives.\n\nWhile CDs aren't widely used for data storage, games, or video due to advances in flash memory, hard drives, and better optical formats such as DVD and Blu-ray; it is still quite popular as a storage solution for music and is number two to the MP3 in terms of total usage for this purpose.\n\nDVD and Blu-ray\n\nDVD and Blu-ray use the same sort of technology as a CD with the notable difference being in the amount of storage a disc contains. In addition, the recovery method differs slightly as each of the two technologies uses a different laser in order to read the information contained on the disc.\n\nDVD - or digital versatile disc - is another optical technology much like LaserDisc or CD. Although similar in appearance, CDs and DVDs vary in the amount of storage space contained on each. While the CD can hold a mere 700 MB of data, DVDs on the other hand could hold up to 4.7 GB on a standard disc, and 17.08 GB of data on a dual-layer, dual-sided disc.\n\nThe DVD wasn't made as a technology to replace CDs, but instead to hold larger amounts of data in addition to being a standardized format for video. CDs on the other hand, were envisioned as mainly a data or audio storage medium. While the conversation could stop there, due to both types of discs being able to handle audio, video, and other types of data storage, the DVD is in fact the better choice for video due to adoption by Phillips, Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic in 1995 due to its larger storage size which allowed higher quality audio and video for film playback.\n\nThe DVD is still in use, but its usefulness for data storage has been stripped away due to flash storage, such as high capacity SD cards or flash drives.\n\nMovies, on the other hand, are still made on DVD, although Blu-ray is the current standard. DVDs have a max resolution of 480i, while Blu-ray features crystal clear 1080p (what do these numbers mean?), which - combined with the decreasing cost of Blu-ray players - has led people to the newer format. That said, in 2014, DVD movies still outsold those on Blu-ray, so it seems DVD isn't quite dead... yet.\n\nSSD and Removable Flash Storage\n\nThe SSD (solid state drive) is the heir apparent to the standard HDD due to faster read and write times, improved reliability, and more energy efficient due to the absence of a platter spinning at 5400 or 7200 RPM. SSD is actually a rather old technology that has roots in the previously discussed section on RAM and magnetic-core memory. Originally, SSDs were RAM-based, which meant it didn't require moving parts like an HDD in order to operate. The one significant drawback to RAM-based SSDs, however, was its volatile nature that required a constant power source in order to prevent data loss.\n\nCurrent SSDs aren't reliant on RAM-based technology; instead, they use the more modern Flash storage.\n\nRemovable Flash storage devices - essentially the portable version of the SSD - are also quite popular. These devices use Flash technology in order to store data on SD cards or USB drives, which make them the smallest, fastest and most portable storage medium to date. Modern removable flash storage devices can hold up to 512 GB which means they're not only portable, they're powerhouses which are beginning to replace physical hard drives in some computers and devices.\n\nThe Move to Replace Physical Storage\n\nAs data storage technology and worldwide connectivity continue to improve the next generation of data storage is likely going to be improvements to technology we already have, before ditching physical storage altogether - for the most part. The chances of all forms of physical storage disappearing are slim to none, but the future of data storage for consumer technologies is markedly less physical.\n\nBlu-ray - although still the best in class for movies - might just be the best example of this shift away from physical storage as the decade-old format has yet to win the war with its predecessor - the DVD. A number of factors contribute to the fact that DVDs still outsell Blu-ray worldwide and upon closer inspection these factors tell us most of what we already know about the future of data storage.\n\nDVDs are not the biggest Blu-ray competitor. The reason DVDs are still outselling Blu-ray obviously aren't technology-related, the cost of a Blu-ray disc or player aren't prohibitive, and there is no shortage of titles available. The real reason DVDs are still outselling Blu-ray discs is due to a split interest in the consumer market.\n\nIn past generations, such as DVD vs VHS, one technology just had to be better, and not too far out of line in pricing with the other. Blu-ray, on the other hand, has to compete with not only DVD, but streaming technology which is not quite a format war, but does lead to some fragmentation of the HD video market.\n\nThis alone is why DVD is still the most dominant physical video format. If you figure streaming rentals, sales and Blu-ray purchases, the next-gen technologies outsell DVDs by a wide margin. The problem, it seems, is market fragmentation as Blu-ray competes not just with DVD, but with its (possibly) next-generation competitor, streaming online video.\n\nStreaming Media\n\nThe biggest competitor for CD, DVD and Blu-ray is streaming media. With Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, and dozens more, the world is full of options for music and high definition video.\n\nWith the convenience, and relative cost-effectiveness of streaming newly-released, as well as classic and hard-to-find movies, music and more, the future of data storage for entertainment is decidedly virtual.\n\nFor anyone that doubts the viability of streaming media and its ability to take down physical formats, look no further than large video chains - like Blockbuster - or even newer and more innovative technologies such as rental kiosks, or even Netflix. Netflix and their DVD via mail service offering started the wheels in motion for disruption in a video rental industry that remained relatively unchanged for decades. Now, although it's still offered in some parts of the world, Netflix is slowly backing away from their DVD mailing efforts in exchange for cheap, on-demand content that you can stream from a number of popular consumer devices.\n\nCloud-based Technology\n\nWhile streaming media is set to disrupt physical data storage formats such as the CD, DVD and Blu-ray disc, cloud-based technology aims to provide the same sort of treatment for physical HDDs, SSDs, and removable flash media, such as SD cards and USB drives.\n\nTo put it into perspective, hard drive technology is getting cheaper and storage capacity is improving, yet laptop and desktop computers are all trending downward in the amount of storage space they come equipped with. While these are all easily upgradeable, the move toward smaller internal storage is largely due to the expanding use of cloud-based technologies in order to store data, files, photos, videos, and more.\n\nWhile the chances that we'll completely do away with any sort of internal memory is rather slim - as we still need internal memory to run our operating systems - the days of limited internal memory in devices is already upon us, and we'll continue to see this effect compound as connection speeds get faster and worldwide connectivity to the web continues to grow.\n\nThe biggest concern with widespread adoption of cloud-based technology is still security. While it's not without merit, it has been proven again and again that physical storage is much more prone to data breaches and theft than encrypted information stored in the cloud. Still, we're not quite at the tipping point in the cloud versus physical storage debate; but I suspect it'll happen sooner rather than later.\n\nFuturistic Takes on What the Data Storage Could Look Like\n\nAn online backup company called Backblaze is trying to find answers to the question of how long a typical hard drive could last. After running 25,000 hard drives simultaneously for testing purposes, the current attrition rate is approximately 22 percent after just four years. Some may last decades, others will fail within the first year, but the hard truth is that modern drives aren't built to last forever - and they won't.\n\nThis sort of failure rate leads to a search for more reliable storage methods, and here are two of the most exciting.\n\nHolographic Data Storage\n\nCurrent storage technologies are dependent on magnets or optical means in which to write information, one bit at a time, on the surface of an object.\n\nHolographic data storage wants to make the leap to recording information throughout the volume of the storage media. The technology is capable of reading and writing millions of bits in parallel, as opposed to the bit-by-bit approach which could lead to astronomically high amounts of data capacity when compared to modern storage means.\n\nDNA Storage\n\nIn the scientific journal Nature, an article by researchers from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) detailed the successful storage of 5 million bits of data containing text and audio were successfully retrieved and reproduced from a single DNA molecule about the size of a speck of dust. The retrieved data consisted of a 26-second audio clip of the \"I Have a Dream Speech,\" all of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, a photograph of the EBI headquarters in the UK, a well-known paper on the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick and a file describing the methods used to encode and convert the data.\n\nTheories have surrounded the use of DNA as a data storage tool for some time now, but the main issue has been the rapid breakdown of DNA in tissue when not stored in a controlled environment. This, however, may have been solved with a recent breakthrough.\n\nAdditional findings from a study detailing the long-term stability of data encoded in DNA were published in an article by researchers from ETH Zurich. Inside the study, researchers found that encapsulating the DNA in glass spheres could protect the data and allow for error-free recovery for up to 1 million years at temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius and 2000 years if stored at 10 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe technology is quite exciting and if estimates are correct, that each cubic millimeter of DNA can hold 5.5 Petabits of data, then it could be a real breakthrough in terms of long-term data storage and recovery. Right now, the technology is cost prohibitive, requiring approximately $12,000 dollars per MB to encode the data and another $220 dollars to retrieve it.\n\nWhile both of these technologies open the door to what the future could hold, they're still very new and largely speculative at this point. The truth is, we aren't quite sure what the future of data storage holds, but that doesn't make it any less exciting to think about.\n\nHow many of these storage devices have you used? Which ones are you most excited about (of those listed - or others) for the future?

Statistics published earlier this week by online commerce market research firm Slice Intelligence revealed that only 22pc of already purchased watches had been dispatched in US on launch weekend. Estimated shipping dates currently range from a couple weeks to months.\n\nThe component in question is what Apple calls the 'taptic engine', a mechanism designed to produce the sensation of being tapped on the wrist. Wall Street Journal sources say that reliability testing on the Apple Watch caused some taptic engines supplied Chinese firm AAC Technologies Holdings Inc to break down over time.\n\nAs the consumer tech giant did not experience the same problem with taptic engines produced by a second supplier, Nidec Corp, it has now shifted nearly all of its production of the component to Japanese firm. How long it will take to make-up the deficit, however, is unclear.\n\n\"Our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on available supply and the order in which they were received,\" Apple told the newspaper. \"We know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.\"\n\nThe new watch, Apple's first all-new category of hardware since the release of iPad in 2010, is available in two sizes (38mm and 42mm) and across three editions: Apple Watch Sport (US$349 to US$399), Apple Watch (US$599 to US$1,099), and from US$10,000 for the Apple Watch Edition.\n\nJust this week the company posted record second quarter financial results. Sales of the Apple Watch did not come into play in the quarter, though early signs are promising, with reports suggesting the company could sell up to 20m units within the first year.", "By Dave Parrack on 29th April, 2015 | Tech News | 2 Comments\n\nGrounded by malfunctioning iPads, Google purchases patents, Dropbox adds comments, Star Wars games land on Steam, stream Seinfeld on Hulu, and the Apple Watch gets blended.\n\nBuggy iPads Down AA Flights\n\nDozens of American Airlines flights were grounded after the iPads used by the pilots crashed without warning. American Airlines use iPads as electronic flight bags, with pilots switching from using the weighty paper-based alternative in 2013.\n\nAccording to Quartz, this was intended to prevent pilots from getting injured carrying heavy flight bags. Dumping the 35-pound bags also saves on fuel costs. Unfortunately, the switch to iPad has invited other problems, and of a potentially more serious nature too.\n\nThe iPads are used to share flight plans with the pilots, and pass other information onto the flight crew. However, what AA described as \"an issue with a software application\" meant the iPads stopped functioning correctly, leading to the flights being grounded until the problem was fixed.\n\nAs anyone who uses technology on a regular basis knows, this basically means turning it off and on again. Which somehow took American Airlines several hours to accomplish.\n\nAll Your Patents Are Belong To Google\n\nIf google had bought Tesla I wonder if they would have opened up all their patents.\n\n-- Stephen Bird (@sebirdman) April 21, 2015\n\nGoogle wants your patents. All of them. Or at least those it feels have some value. In order to find these patents and buy them from their current owners, Google has created a new Patent Purchase Promotion. Which is essentially a marketplace designed to remove any friction from the process.\n\nThe marketplace will open on May 8 and stay open until May 22. Individuals and businesses are invited to put their patents up for sale during that window, and Google will then determine which patents it wants to purchase. Google hopes to have all sales tied up by the end of August.\n\nThe big idea here is for Google to buy up valuable patents before they fall into the hands of patent trolls out to make a fast buck. As noted by TechCrunch, the added bonus for Google is that it gets to see what patents are currently available, and pick and choose those which it thinks will pay off financially over the longterm.\n\nDropbox Adds Comments To Shared Files\n\nNow available to all Dropbox users -- commenting! http://t.co/Dtr0GX9V0l pic.twitter.com/sH7WX7mcEN\n\n-- Dropbox (@Dropbox) April 28, 2015\n\nDropbox is adding a commenting option to all shared files. Formerly only available to business users, all Dropbox users on the Web can now add comments, and the feature will soon be coming to mobile too.\n\nThis all means you can have conversations with people around Dropbox files, whether they're your own or ones that have been shared with you. Mentioning someone by name or email address adds them to the conversation, and you can choose to receive email notifications when a new comment is added.\n\nStar Wars Games Touch Down on Steam\n\nSteam has added a host of new Star Wars titles to its store, with Star Wars: TIE Fighter Special Edition, Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, Star Wars: X-Wing Special Edition, and Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter all being available to download either individually or as part of a bundle.\n\nThis is all just in time for Star Wars Day on May 4th, and in advance of the new Star Wars: Battlefront game due to arrive in November.

If you don't like Star Wars then you should consider moving somewhere off the grid for the rest of 2015.\n\nHulu Streams Every Seinfeld Episode\n\nHulu has reportedly bought the rights to stream every episode of Seinfeld on its service. The deal for rights to show all 180 episode is, depending on which source you believe, worth between $130 million (Deadline) and $180 million (Variety). Which works out to between $700,000- and $1 million-per-episode.\n\nWith Netflix having secured the rights to stream Friends in its entirety, this pitches two of the best comedies of the 1990s against each other.

It's hard to believe that less than a decade ago, we were witnessing the birth of industry giants such as YouTube and Facebook. A lot has happened since then, and today we're going to focus on some of the most disruptive tech breakthroughs in this time period.\n\nAs with any list of this nature, it's not all-encompassing, and will remain largely open to debate about the inclusions and snubs. Feel free to share those opinions with me in the comment section below!\n\n2005 YouTube\n\nYouTube was founded by three early employees of PayPal - Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim - in February of 2005. Just over a year later, the service was purchased by Google for $1.65 billion.\n\nDepending on which of the original co-founders you ask, YouTube either started as:\n\nA dating service that inspired to be similar to a video version of the popular website (at the time) Hot or Not, or; A sort of video directory inspired by Jawed Karim's struggles to find clips of Janet Jackson's infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" at the 2004 SuperBowl.\n\nUltimately it became (and still is) the most popular video sharing website online, and currently features 300 hours of video uploaded to the site every minute! Once you remove the annoying parts, it's actually one of the better video hosts online for both uploading and viewing.\n\n2006 Facebook Opens Its Doors to Everyone\n\nFacebook officially launched on February 4, 2004 but 2006 saw the rapidly growing social network open its doors to the public for the first time. Initially, the founders had limited the websites registrations to students of Harvard University, but later expanded to other Boston-area colleges, Ivy League Schools, and then Stanford University before allowing public registrations in 2006.\n\nMyspace was the industry giant during Facebook's initial days, but the platform ultimately removed Tom from your top 8 shortly after its public release. Since then, Facebook has achieved a meteoric rise that saw founder Mark Zuckerberg turn down at least two billion-plus dollar offers before taking the company public with a valuation of $104 billion. Facebook scams and privacy concerns aside, Facebook remains one of the most popular sites on the web with over 1.3 billion active users and (as of February 2015) a current market cap of $212 billion.\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter was created in March 2006, and officially launched in July of that same year. The website brought the term \"microblogging\" to the forefront due to its 140-character limit on text updates, called \"tweets\". Before this time, blogs were the main form of short-form opinion and dialogue between users, but Twitter turned the world on its head by offering a service that allowed people to express quick thoughts or opinions, share links, and converse freely amongst one another without the need for the cumbersome personal blog that most of us has become accustomed to.\n\nThe most disruptive element to Twitter is the speed at which it can be used to circulate information. During revolutions or periods of conflict in Greece, Moldova, Iran, Liberia, Egypt, Tunisia and others, Twitter was widely used as a platform to relay information on the ground to major media outlets, and an organizational tool for the protestors and revolutionaries.\n\nTwitter was arguably the most valuable piece of the Egyptian revolution due to media and Internet blackouts by the Mubarak regime that made organization and information sharing difficult.\n\n2007 iPhone and iOS\n\nRiding the wave of the iPod release, Apple set out to - once again - disrupt the way in which consumers used their devices. While it wasn't the first smartphone on the market, it was clearly the best of its time and to this day, each new iteration is wildly successful in terms of number of units sold.\n\nSteve Jobs led the development of the iPhone along with a team of 1,000 Apple employees who started work on the device in 2004. \"Project Purple\" as it was referred to, saw secretive collaboration between Apple (who wanted - and received - full creative control over the production and implementation) and AT&T (then Cingular Wireless). At a cost of $150 million and thirty months of development time, the iPhone was announced at Macworld 2007, and released on June 29, 2007.\n\nAmazon Kindle\n\nThe first generation Kindle released on November 19, 2007 with a retail price of $399. It sold out in less than 6 hours, and remained out of stock until April of 2008. Possibly the most historically disruptive technology on the list, the Kindle completely changed the way most of us read everything from books and magazines to newspapers and trade journals. This, in and of itself isn't an easy feat, as not much has really changed in the world of books and magazines in the last century.\n\nThe original Kindle featured a 6-inch screen and 250 MB of internal storage. The key selling point of the device was the Whispernet feature, which allowed you to download, read and store publications over a 3G connection.\n\n2008 Android\n\nAndroid had rather humble beginnings as an operating system that utilized location data and owner preferences in order to custom tailor a user experience to its owner as opposed to the one-size-fits-all approach used by industry giants Symbian and Windows Mobile. The company struggled, and was eventually acquired by Google in 2005.\n\nFast forward to 2008, and Android released the first consumer product that utilized its operating system, the HTC Dream. The goal was to open standards for mobile developers to better utilize phone hardware in hopes of further breakthroughs in the mobile space. From its humble beginnings, Android grew into the most popular operating system in the world. As of 2014, devices using the Android OS made up 77.8 percent of the global market.\n\n2009 Google Maps Turn-by-turn Navigation\n\nIn-car and personal navigation systems had been around for a few years prior, but Google revolutionized the portable GPS market when they announced their public beta release for Google Maps Navigation on October 28, 2009.\n\nWhat made the offering disruptive was the idea that instead of downloading and installing firmware updates featuring new maps, or CDs with updated navigation data, you could now do this wirelessly, over a mobile internet connection (3G at the time). In addition, this made the standalone navigation system rather redundant for smartphone users as yet another technology was swallowed by the all-encompassing smartphone.\n\nWe'll stop there for now for the sake of brevity. Be sure to keep an eye out for part two of this post where we'll discuss tech from 2010 to current, such as the iPad and Instagram. See you there!\n\nAs for this part, what'd I miss?

Unless you've rooted or jailbroken your device, the answer is probably no. Smartphone viruses are real, but app stores do a pretty good job of filtering them out.\n\nOf course, no process is perfect. Stuff has gotten through, which we'll get to.\n\nBut assuming you stick to your phone's official software store - the App Store for iOS and Google Play on Android - the odds of infection are extremely low, thanks to approval processes on both platforms. Let's talk about how these systems work, what kinds of malware have gotten through, and how you can protect yourself.\n\nHow Do The Filters Work?\n\nAs of spring 2015, both major mobile platforms review software before adding it to their app stores. For one platform, this is a recent change.\n\nGoogle's Android Market (now Google Play) was once famously open, meaning apps of all sort were put into the store without a lot of oversight. Problems like malware were caught by users - Google would take down apps when problems were reported. A software malware filter was eventually added, which scanned all submissions for known infections.\n\nSometime in late 2014 Google went even further, employing someone to look over every app.\n\nHuman reviewers (not kittens) manually review every app that goes into the store. Google's approval for apps tends to be fast - usually a couple of hours, sometimes a few days.\n\nApple's not so speedy - apps sometimes take a week to get through the App Store approval process. Human reviewers have gone through every app since the Store launched, meaning developers have to wait a long time after submitting their app before it shows up in the store. Software with malware is usually rejected (along with a lot of other apps).\n\nSay what you will about how long this process takes - and many have said plenty - but the result is that very few of the millions of apps in the App Store have ever featured malware.\n\nBoth systems mean that the software you install using the official stores on your phone were reviewed, by some combination of software malware filters and human reviewers. The odds of something nasty getting through all that is low, but not impossible: some things have gotten through on both platforms.\n\nExamples of Malware Getting Through\n\nContrary to popular belief, iPhones can get malware, mostly if they're jailbroken. But it's been proven, in theory, that malware could slip through Apple's famously strict filtering process. A research team at Georgia Tech managed to sneak some malware into an app, and Apple's process did not catch it. Being researchers, they pulled the app themselves - a courtesy actual scammers probably wouldn't bother with.\n\nActual adware has gotten through Google Play's process. Earlier this year Durak, a fairly popular card game, was found to include malware. This would stay dormant for a while - likely the reason it wasn't caught - before showing popup ads for third party app stores. (Presumably, if you installed these third party app stores, you'd end up with even more problems).\n\nGoogle has since removed Durak from Play, but it's possible similar apps could slip through in the future. If you're suspicious, follow our steps to find out if your Android device has malware.\n\nDon't Panic, But Stay Vigilant\n\nIt's worth noting that, in both these cases, the apps were eventually found and removed from their respective stores. In this way, users serve as a second approval process: discovering and reporting malware, which gives Apple and Google a chance to remove the offending apps.\n\nThis means that, if you want to avoid such malware, the following steps will go a long way:\n\nStick to software found in the official app stores: Google Play on Android and the App Store on iOS. Avoid apps with very few reviews, or that were added to the app store only recently, unless you really trust the company that makes it. Google apps you're not sure about, to find third-party reviews from sites you trust. Malware Outside App Stores\n\nWhile official app store infections are possible, they shouldn't be the main concern for mobile users. Most Android malware, for example, comes from third-party app stores (i.e., not Google Play) or pirated software from shady sites (read this before downloading cracked Android apps).\n\nBut malware doesn't have to come from apps at all. Wirelurker, for example, infects iOS devices via OS X, over USB - and it works regardless of whether your iOS device is jailbroken. To quote Palo Alto Networks, a security firm:\n\nWireLurker monitors any iOS device connected via USB with an infected OS X computer and installs downloaded third-party applications or automatically generated malicious applications onto the device, regardless of whether it is jailbroken.\n\nSo, part of keeping your mobile devices free from infection is keeping your desktop devices clean - and even Mac users need to be vigilant. Here's how to tell if your Mac has malware.\n\nDon't Panic\n\nI'm not a big fan of the walled-garden approach to application distribution, but I have to admit: malware is a pretty strong argument for this approach. But I'm sure you all have opinions, so let me know what you think in the comments below (even if it's that I'm a horrible wrong person, who is wrong).\n\nAds by Google Get the best tips from MakeUseOf in your inbox, free!

However given that they both run very different operating systems, there are only so many features that can be shared and this is where Microsoft comes in.\n\nDuring their Build conference, the Redmond company announced Continuum. However unlike Continuity, Continuum will turn your phone into a desktop. For example if you have access to a screen, keyboard, and mouse, all you'd have to do is connect your phone to it and it will then transform itself into a desktop and give users a desktop-like experience.\n\nEssentially what happens is that your phone will act as the main hub that powers everything. Apps will scale itself to fill up the screen and in some instances will also be able to transform its user interface to work better with a mouse and keyboard, and according to Microsoft even your favorite keyboard shortcuts in apps such as Microsoft Word will work just fine.\n\nThe dual screen capability also means that you can keep using your phone while plugged into a screen and have two things going on at once on separate devices, even though they are connected to each other. Of course the question is how many developers will actually take advantage of this and upscale and edit their apps to make it Continuum-friendly remains to be seen. However it is an intriguing idea and one that we're sure professionals on the go will want to take advantage of in the future.", "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on a roll these days, with new Surface tablets about to hit stores, Office apps on tablets, a quarter that beat analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings and excitement continues to build for Windows 10. Today the company kicked off Microsoft Build 2015, the developer conference The Verge calls \"Microsoft's most important event of the year.\"\n\nSource: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Build is a developers conference, and that's what makes it so critical to the future -- Microsoft has to get developers excited. Getting them to ramp up their software for Windows 10 is obviously important, but new technology like HoloLens and cross-platform iOS and Android initiatives need developer support if they're to succeed.\n\nThe key note was schedule for two and a half hours, but actually went for three. It included not just Windows 10 updates and developer-centric technical jargon, but also peeks at some exciting new Microsoft products.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Microsoft Build 2015.\n\nMicrosoft Build: All About Platforms\n\nThree platforms were spiked out as being a focus for the company going forward:\n\nThe intelligent cloud -- Azure Productivity and business process Personal computing\n\nThe stats around Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, were impressive: 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, 1.4 million databases and a growth rate of 90,000 new customer subscriptions/month. Big reveals on the intelligent cloud front included a free, cross-platform Visual Studio Code editor for Windows, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) OS X and Linux. Also getting the spotlight were Azure's machine learning and analytics capabilities.\n\nWith Office, the message was that Microsoft is moving away from the idea of Office as a series of standalone apps, toward the concept of Office as a platform. With 1.5 billion users, it's a big platform.\n\nIt's the idea that you can open an Excel spreadsheet in Windows 10, then open the same thing in Excel on an iPad or other device with all the data just magically appearing. Microsoft has been pushing this concept for a while now, but the platform idea is getting deeper. For example, developers can now write add-ons for Office apps, which will work in iOS, Android and online, as well as on the native Windows software.\n\nWindows 10\n\nPersonal computing was all about Windows 10. It's being pushed as a unified operating system that spans multiple classes of devices (including mobile and PCs) with a single app store for minimized developer effort and maximized revenue. Universal Windows 10 apps will run on all these devices, unlike the Apple approach that requires iOS and OS X apps to be developed separately.\n\nAmong the promises made to developers:\n\n\"Integrate Cortana into your apps, integrate Xbox Live into your apps. Add natural user interactions to your apps like pen of speech, and turn your apps into holograms.\"\n\nMicrosoft pledged a goal of having 1 billion devices running Windows 10 within a two-to-three year window after release.\n\nNew ways of releasing apps to the Windows Store were demonstrated. Websites can register with the Windows Store to be opened on a PC as an app, and existing Win32 and .NET apps can be offered (they'll run in isolation in Windows 10 for safety).\n\nThe biggest news was on the mobile front. Android developers will be able to port their apps to Windows 10 with the code remaining largely intact -- Windows' navigation services are used instead of Android's, but that's the only real difference. In addition, Microsoft's Visual Studio will support re-compiling iOS apps for Windows 10. On the smartphone and tablet front, this could go a long way toward solving Windows' app disadvantage compared to the two big mobile platforms.\n\nNaturally, the latest features of the Windows 10 operating system were showed off, including transparency in the Start Menu, the return of Jump Lists, Windows spotlight and new Cortana capabilities.\n\nThe new Windows 10 web browser (formerly known as Spartan) finally has an official name: Microsoft Edge. Microsoft's next-generation browser also supports extensions, like Chrome and Firefox do now -- in fact, an extension written for Chrome then recompiled for Microsoft Edge was demonstrated.\n\nContinuum was demonstrated again, this time on a smartphone showing how a Windows 10 phone can scale up to a PC -- plug it into an external monitor, use a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and it's basically a desktop experience.\n\nHoloLens\n\nWindows HoloLens stole the show in terms of visual displays. While the entertainment possibilities of the technology seem endless, the company showed video illustrating its use in business and brought out a professor to explain how it's being used in medical education.\n\nHoloLens runs universal Windows apps, so all the new Windows 10 software will run within HoloLens.\n\nMicrosoft Build: New Hardware?\n\nMicrosoft gave away a free Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) Sceptre convertible laptop to attendees -- dissing the MacBook Pro in the process -- but that was it for hardware. A new Lumia flagship smartphone and Surface Pro 4 had been rumored, but didn't make the cut.\n\nWrapping up the keynote, Nadella said his goal as the company celebrates its 40th anniversary is to move users away from needing to use Windows to wanting to use Windows. Based on the Windows 10 and HoloLens demonstrations at the Windows Build keynote, the company is definitely on the right track.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp., speaks during a keynote session at the Microsoft Developers Build Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.\n\nThe word of the day for Microsoft is: platform. On Wednesday, CEO Satya Nadella and his lieutenants ran through a nearly three-hour keynote presentation to kick off the company's annual Build developer conference in San Francisco, and no word came from executive lips more often than \"platform.\"\n\nNadella called Microsoft a platform company. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's executive vice president of operating systems, only referred to Windows 10 as a platform. Microsoft Azure, a cloud service to build and deploy apps on? Yes, it's also a platform. HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality headset, which runs Windows 10, was even positioned as a platform that'll define the future of how we interact with computers -- taking on both wearables and virtual reality at once.\n\nThe reason Microsoft's platform push is important to you -- whether you're an investor, developer or consumer -- is because it reflects how the company views itself, and where it's moving in order to attract customers beyond the core Windows business users and devotees. Microsoft has had a string of flops with Windows Phone 7, 8 and 8.1; and Windows 8 and 8.1. By ignoring Web standards adopted by Google's Chrome Web browser, Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox, Microsoft's Internet Explorer grew largely irrelevant. And while Apple's Mac sales continue to grow, the Windows PC market remains in an overall downward slope.\n\nOne Windows, Everywhere\n\nCentral to Windows Phone and Windows 8 is the idea that your phone, tablet and PC should run software that looks and behaves the same. Windows 10's major theme is much the same: that it's one operating system that's able to run the same apps across all these different devices -- a sermon Nadella and those in Redmond hope will win over consumers, developers and investors alike.\n\nMicrosoft's idea of one continuous platform runs contrary to the vision of both Apple (with OS X, iOS and now a Watch OS) and Google (with Chrome OS, Android and its wearable platform, Android Wear). Microsoft showed off almost no new features for Windows 10 during the keynote, and execs didn't say when it would arrive on new devices. (A Microsoft spokesman said the company is sticking to the \"summer\" timeframe it first threw out back in January.) But they did show Windows 10 running on phones, PCs and the HoloLens augmented reality headset.\n\nContinuum: Your Phone Can Be a PC\n\nA new feature will allow Windows 10 phone owners to plug their devices into a PC display, using the phone as though it were an actual desktop computer.\n\nIn his demo, Joe Belfiore, a corporate vice president in the operating systems group, plugged a phone into a monitor and controlled what was on screen with a keyboard and mouse. He checked some email and edited a PowerPoint presentation and PowerPoint didn't look like a dumbed-down phone version, but the full-blown PC variant.\n\nContinuum, as it's called, will eventually be a part of Windows 10, but it's all still very much in development. When it does become a reality, it will require special hardware, such as compatible phones and/or monitors.\n\n1 Billion Devices in 3 Years\n\nMyerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, said that more than 1 billion new and existing phones, tablets and PCs will be able to run Windows 10 and that over the next two to three years, the company wants to get the people who use those machines to convert over to Windows 10.\n\nThe goal is hugely ambitious, especially since Windows 8 sales never came close to reaching that number. In February 2014, the last time Microsoft publicly shared its Windows sales numbers, the company said it had sold more than 200 million licenses. Windows 7 sold more than 240 million.\n\nAndroid and iOS Apps on Windows -- Maybe\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of news coming from Build today was that Microsoft has built Windows 10 to allow developers to easily port over apps built for Android and iOS. If developers take the time to bring their apps over to Windows 10 smartphones (Microsoft isn't calling them Windows Phones anymore), this could mean a long-overdue boom in Windows smartphone apps. But whether or not developers take pains to do this remains to be seen.\n\nWhile the news might be encouraging for Windows Phone users who are bummed they're missing out on the latest apps found on other handsets, this is likely to have little impact on Windows tablets or laptops. After all, when was the last time you ran a phone app on your desktop, outside of Angry Birds?\n\nEdging Out Internet Explorer\n\nIn January, Microsoft showed off Project Spartan, a new Web browser that's built to run on phones, tablets and PCs. Well, Project Spartan has a new name: Microsoft Edge. How much Edge has in common with Internet Explorer remains to be seen. But, Microsoft is adamant that Edge is built for the modern Web -- desktop and mobile. Belfiore demoed Edge, showing off Cortana for voice searches, as well as its built-in note taking and annotation features. Will Edge be able to help Microsoft gain the ground Internet Explorer lost?\n\nHoloLens: Apps Wanted\n\nMicrosoft demoed apps for its HoloLens augmented-reality headset for the first time today. The demo was partially to show off how potentially cool HoloLens could be, and to prod developers into making \"universal Windows apps\" that run on phones, tablets, PCs and HoloLens, too. Microsoft said that NASA, Disney, AutoDesk and video game developer Unity are all working on HoloLens apps right now. And it gave a demo of an app that dissected a human body for medical students studying anatomy. The app, which is being tested by students and professors at Case Western Reserve University, allowed HoloLens wearers to see bodies and body parts in a life-sized scale or blown up to see otherwise minute details.\n\nJust as it did in January, HoloLens wowed us and left us with the impression that while Windows 10's success isn't guaranteed, and Windows phones are still languishing, Microsoft does have some cutting-edge ideas in the works. Microsoft brought hundreds of HoloLens headsets to Build for developers and press to try out (we haven't gotten a demo yet), and says the headset should go on sale later this year. When and how much? Well, Microsoft isn't saying just yet.", "During its Wednesday earnings call, Apple rival Samsung Electronics reported net profit of 4.63 trillion won ($4.35 billion) for the January to March quarter, a 39% drop from its net profit of 7.49 trillion won in the year ago quarter. A sizable portion of the lost profit came from Samsung's mobile division, which brought in 2.74 trillion won ($2.5 billion) in the first quarter of 2015, vs. 6.43 trillion won in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nDespite the year over year profit loss, Samsung's earnings release highlighted its quarter over quarter improvement and pointed towards increased sales of middle-end smartphones including the Galaxy A series. Samsung doesn't divulge its smartphone sales, but analysts believe the company sold 83.2 million smartphones during the quarter, compared to Apple's 61.2 million.\n\nThe high number of sales let Samsung regain its title of the worlds largest smartphone maker, but many of those sales were for lower-priced phones and not flagship devices, causing it to lose profit year over year. Much of Samsung's profit loss can be attributed to the introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, letting Apple devices compete with Samsung devices on screen size for the first time.\n\nAhead of the launch of the two larger-screened iPhones, big screens were a feature that set Samsung devices apart from iPhones and drew customers for the South Korean company, but with the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus, Samsung has lost some of its grasp on customers seeking devices with bigger displays.\n\nSamsung expects its profits to increase during the second quarter following the global launch of the company's new Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge and on the strength of its semiconductor business. According to Samsung, demand for its curved S6 Edge has been high, but limited supplies have restricted sales.", "IBM and Oracle are among the top guesses; other possibilities include SAP, HP, Apple and Microsoft\n\nA report that Salesforce.com is entertaining takeover offers whipped up a storm of speculation Wednesday, as analysts and other observers mulled the possibility and what it could mean for the enterprise software market.\n\n\"It would require a massive deal for that to happen,\" noted Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst with Constellation Research. \"Salesforce still has a lot of growth ahead.\"\n\nSpurred by the approach of a potential acquirer, Salesforce has hired financial advisers to help it field such offers, according to the Bloomberg report, which was based on anonymous sources. The company's stock closed up 11.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization just north of $47 billion.\n\nSalesforce did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRumors have swirled for some time that Salesforce is for sale, Wang noted, and clearly suitors would have to be very large companies.\n\n\"You'd have to ask who could afford it, and who could get it done,\" said Michael Fauscette, a group vice president with IDC. \"The afford list is maybe: IBM, Oracle, SAP, Apple, Microsoft.\"\n\nIn the \"who could get it done\" category, however, the list is much shorter, Fauscette added. \"IBM might seem like a logical choice, but I wonder if the fairly new CEO could pull it off -- and whether [Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff] would let that happen.\"\n\nOracle is a more likely candidate, \"and don't rule out SAP,\" he added.\n\nAlso worth remembering is Oracle's acquisition of Sun, when then Oracle CEO Larry Ellison \"let someone else set the price\" but wasn't willing to lose the deal, according to Fauscette.\n\nOracle also got the vote of Frank Scavo, president of Computer Economics.\n\nMicrosoft, SAP, HP and IBM were all on Scavo's list of possibilities, but both Microsoft and SAP would have to integrate Salesforce's software with their respective Azure and Hana platforms. \"I dont think either Microsoft or SAP would want to plop down $50 billion just to have the opportunity to start work on a big infrastructure project,\" Scavo said.\n\nHP, meanwhile, \"couldnt make the Autonomy acquisition fly for $10 billion, so Im not sure theyd want to try Salesforce for five times that amount,\" he added.\n\nThe logical buyer is IBM, said Denis Pombriant, managing principal at Beagle Research Group. \"The company could afford it, and they have cash that they don't know what to do with -- they are buying back shares to increase shareholder value,\" Pombriant noted.\n\nIn addition, aside from its consulting business, \"IBM doesn't have a big portfolio of future invention that will carry it forward, so an acquisition is logical,\" he added. If it does turn out to be IBM, Oracle \"will make a play in its own defense, and while we're at it HP will join the fray for similar reasons,\" Pombriant predicted.\n\nOf course, the cultural differences are stark between Salesforce and IBM, he noted.\n\n\"Salesforce is California laid-back, IBM is New York pinstripes; Salesforce is a risk taker and IBM is risk averse,\" he said. \"I don't think Benioff or his company would survive in IBM. IBM is where software companies go to die.\"\n\nRegardless of the identity of any potential buyers, there could be several factors motivating Salesforce to consider putting the company up for sale.\n\n\"The best time to sell, of course, is when the share price is at or near its top,\" Scavo pointed out. \"So, its possible that Salesforce sees selling out as a better opportunity right now than to continue to invest for growth.\"\n\nThe company may feel the need of a larger organization to help it, \"perhaps to fill in the lack of their own infrastructure portfolio,\" suggested IDC research manager Larry Carvalho.\n\nIn the end, the company is obligated to shareholders to entertain all offers, Wang pointed out. \"What they really want to do is get ahead of that and put in a mechanism to ensure a fair and objective process.\"", "SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung, control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.

Amazon just posted results from a great quarter on the back of strong revenue and earnings growth, while Microsoft is pushing towards highs unseen since 2000 and the company appears to be handling what could have been a rough transition away from PCs pretty well all things considered.\n\nBeyond these two, the top component in the Nasdaq, Apple, continues to be an all-star performer.

They also announced the official name for a new web browser, called \"Edge,\" that they promised will be faster and more useful than the Internet Explorer that's been a Microsoft mainstay for 20 years.\n\nAll those initiatives are tied to the impending release of Windows 10, the centerpiece of Microsoft's ambitions to regain the stature it commanded when Windows-based PCs dominated the computing world. Today, after losing ground to smartphones and tablets that run software from rivals Apple and Google, Microsoft wants to make Windows 10 the universal software for PCs, phones and other Internet-connected gadgets.\n\n\"Windows 10 represents a new generation of Windows, built for an era of more personal computing,\" CEO Satya Nadella said during a keynote speech, adding that today's consumers and corporate workers want to have the same experience when they are using a variety of devices.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has previously shown off some features of Windows 10, it's hoping to enlist an army of software developers as allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm for the new release. The company is using the three-day conference, called Build, to demonstrate more features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,\" vice president Terry Myerson said.\n\nTo win over consumers who use competing software, Microsoft needs to persuade outside developers, who create software for consumers and corporate clients, it's worth their time to create new apps and programs for Windows 10.\n\n\"Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,\" said J.P. Gownder, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. He said Microsoft has struggled with a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem, in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for Windows because relatively few people use Windows phones and tablets.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 1.4 million apps for Android phones and about the same for Apple devices, while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on Windows phones and tablets.\n\nMicrosoft's move to help developers adapt their Apple and Android apps for Windows 10 is a major change from the past, when each company maintained rigid differences in their software platforms. Microsoft is also hoping to entice developers by promising that apps for Windows 10 will work equally well on PCs, mobile gadgets, Xbox game consoles and even the HoloLens.\n\nThe company has another big carrot to wave in front of those developers: Microsoft has already said it will release Windows 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have PCs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of Windows, provided they upgrade in the coming year. That could help create a huge new audience of Windows 10 users in a relatively short time, Gownder said.\n\nMyerson predicted there will be a billion devices using Windows 10 within the next two to three years. Apps for all those devices will be distributed through a single Windows app store. Myerson also said Microsoft will partner with wireless carriers so consumers who lack credit cards can pay for apps on their phone bill -- a popular method in developing nations.\n\nMicrosoft has not said exactly when Windows 10 is coming, although some were hoping the company would announce a date on Wednesday.\n\nSince he became CEO last year, Nadella has been presiding over a major overhaul at Microsoft. He has redesigned some of Microsoft's most popular programs for mobile users and invested in new \"cloud-computing\" services, in which businesses pay to use software that's housed in Microsoft's data centers.\n\nMicrosoft announced several new initiatives Wednesday for its Azure cloud-computing service, which has emerged as a fast-growing rival to a popular cloud business operated by Amazon. Microsoft is releasing new programming tools for Azure clients to create programs for computers that run Apple and Linux software, as well as those that run Windows.", "Mac: Pixelmator, our favorite image editing app for Mac was updated with a few new tricks today, including a much faster Repair tool, support for Apple's new Photos app, and more.\n\nThe new Repair tool is way faster than the previous one, which makes editing images a lot easier.

Beyond that, you can now open images from the Photos app directly from Pixelmator, and if you have one of the new MacBooks, paint with pressure sensitivity using the Force Touch trackpad.

Apple noted the amount could be \"material,\" though said it couldn't estimate the level.\n\n\"The company believes the European Commission's assertions are without merit,\" Apple said in the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.\n\nThe European Union in June 2014 opened an investigation into Apple's tax practices in Ireland. At the time, the group said it was examining whether Apple's tax rate -- about 2 percent, which is far less than the standard 12.5 percent corporate tax -- amounted to illegal state aid from Ireland. Apple has said it obtained the better rate through negotiations with the Irish government.\n\nSee also China passes US to become Apple's biggest iPhone marke Strong iPhone demand pushes Apple's sales -- again Apple dodged paying billions in taxes, subcommittee says\n\nThe company operates two subsidiaries in Ireland. It doesn't have to pay US taxes on the money generated from regions those businesses serve -- including Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- as long as the money remains overseas and is reinvested in non-US regions. The EU, however, believes the rate Apple pays in Ireland is too low, even for a country where the normal corporate tax rate is about a third the rate of the US.\n\n\"When public budgets are tight, and citizens are asked to make efforts to deal with consequences of the crisis, it cannot be accepted that large multinationals do not pay their fair share in taxes,\" Europe's competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia said last year when announcing the investigation.\n\nEU and US investigations\n\nThe EU probe follows a similar investigation by the US government. A US Senate subcommittee in May 2013 questioned Cook about the amount of cash Apple keeps offshore, saying it exploited tax loopholes by setting up subsidiaries in overseas locations with lower tax rates. The US Internal Revenue Service is currently examining Apple for the years of 2010 through 2012.\n\nCook, in his opening statement at the Senate hearing in 2013, said Apple had become \"the largest corporate income taxpayer in the United States,\" with a 2012 federal cash effective tax rate of 30.5 percent. That year, Apple paid the US Treasury nearly $6 billion in cash, which equated to more than $16 million per day. The company disclosed Tuesday that for the quarter ended March 28, it paid a tax rate of 26.9 percent, which is below the US federal rate of 35 percent because of its overseas holdings in Ireland.\n\nAs of March 28, Apple had $193.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, up $15.6 billion from three months earlier. More than $171 billion, or 89 percent, of that amount is held overseas. Cook testified in 2013 that Apple's foreign subsidiaries at the time held 70 percent of the company's cash \"because of the rapid growth of our international business.\"\n\n\"Under the current US corporate tax system, it would be very expensive to repatriate that cash,\" Cook said during his Senate testimony in 2013. \"Unfortunately, the tax code has not kept up with the digital age. The tax system handicaps American corporations in relation to our foreign competitors who don't have such constraints on the free flow of capital.\"\n\nInside Apple Watch launches around the world... See full gallery 1 - 4 / 46 Next Prev\n\nApple's revenue increasingly is coming from overseas, which boosts the amount of cash held outside the US. In the most recently reported quarter, 37 percent of Apple's sales, or $21.3 billion, came from the Americas while the remainder came from Europe, Greater China, Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific. Greater China passed Europe to become Apple's second largest market overall with revenue of $16.8 billion. The region also surpassed the US to become Apple's biggest iPhone market. Overall, Apple's generated $58 million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter that ended March 28.\n\nApple's not alone when it comes to finding strategies to avoid paying high tax levels. Many large US companies, facing the possibility of steep tax bills in their home countries, have taken steps over the years to shift revenue into overseas shell companies. Some, like Cisco and Qualcomm, have pushed for tax holidays that would allow them to bring foreign-held cash back to the US at much lower tax rates. They have argued that such holidays would allow them to create more jobs and help the economy, but critics say that's often not true. Instead, companies often institute dividends and other policies to reward investors and executives.\n\nStill, Apple and others have defended their tax strategies.\n\n\"We pay all the taxes we owe -- every single dollar,\" Cook testified in 2013. \"We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don't depend on tax gimmicks. We don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell products back into the US to avoid US taxes. We don't stash money on some Caribbean island. We don't borrow money from our foreign subsidiaries to fund our US business in order to skirt the repatriation tax.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal earlier reported the news.", "It's impossible to ensure that only good guys will be able to access them, lawmakers say\n\nU.S. lawmakers are skeptical of an FBI request for Congress to mandate encryption workarounds in smartphones, with critics saying Wednesday that back doors would create new vulnerabilities that bad guys can exploit.\n\nIt's currently impossible for smartphone makers to build in back doors that allow law enforcement agencies access to encrypted communications but also keep out cybercriminals, witnesses and lawmakers said during a hearing before the IT subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nLaw enforcement representatives called on lawmakers to find a way to allow access to encrypted data as a way to prevent serious crime. Late last year, FBI Director James Comey called for a public debate on encryption after Apple and Google announced they would offer new encryption tools on their smartphone OSes.\n\nBut most lawmakers questioned the need for encryption workarounds. Building in back doors for encryption on smartphones would be \"technologically stupid,\" said Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat with a background in computer science. Apple and Google have responded to public demand for encryption because of an \"out-of-control surveillance state,\" he added.\n\nWith all kinds of unencrypted digital information and tracking technologies available to law enforcement agencies, police are living in a \"golden age of surveillance,\" added Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and committee chairman. \"We're certainly not going to go dark, and in some ways, we've never been brighter.\"\n\nCongress needs to find the right balance between privacy and national security, but building back doors in encryption would be similar to \"drilling a hole in a windshield,\" Chaffetz said. If Apple can figure out how to circumvent smartphone users' encryption, \"so can the nefarious folks in a van down by the river,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI doesn't need to hold the keys to encrypted information on smartphones, but policymakers and the technology industry need to figure out a way to allow law enforcement access to criminals' devices when a judge issues a warrant, said Amy Hess, executive assistant director at the FBI's Science and Technology Branch. Tech companies should implement encryption workarounds in the product \"design phase,\" she said.\n\nWhen criminals are storing information on encrypted devices, the process of obtaining search warrants may be \"an exercise in futility,\" Hess said. The FBI believes that \"no one in this country should be beyond the law,\" she added. \"The notion that a suspected criminal's closet could never be opened, or his phone could never be unlocked, even with properly obtained legal authority, is troubling.\"\n\nPolice have used information on smartphones to investigate many crimes, including child pornography and human trafficking, added Daniel Conley, district attorney in Boston. He called on Congress to require smartphone makers to allow law enforcement access to encrypted data and on technology companies to come up with new ways to allow law enforcement access to data.\n\nPolice agencies need access to digital information to solve crimes, and they don't otherwise track people, he added. \"We don't monitor websites where people visit or aggregate data about people's personal health, wealth or shopping habits,\" Conley said. \"That, frankly, is the purview of companies like Apple and Google.\"\n\nConley had harsh words for data collection by technology companies. \"Their nominal commitment to privacy rights would be far more credible if they were forbidding themselves access to their customers' interests, search terms and consumer habits, but as we all know, they're taking full advantage of their customers' private data for commercial purposes,\" he added.\n\nOther witnesses at the hearing said encryption workarounds would cause serious problems for technology vendors. U.S. smartphone apps that allow back doors would likely be banned in many European countries, said Jon Potter, president of the Application Developers Alliance. In addition, if the U.S. demands encryption back doors, other countries will follow suit, he said.\n\n\"Nearly every digital business wants to be global,\" he said. \"But mandatory government back doors may spark a trade war and imprison businesses in their home country.\"\n\nGrant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for The IDG News Service.

The report claims that Taptic Engines manufactured by AAC Technologies Holdings were found to break down over time forcing Apple to slow production of the Apple Watch until June.\n\nThe Taptic Engine was built to \"tap\" Apple Watch users on the wrist whenever they receive an alert or notification, or press down on the display. It is a main Apple Watch feature touted by Apple CEO Tim Cook during the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference in February, when he famously said the Watch would \"tap\" you every 10 minutes to remind you to stand up \"because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer\".\n\nThe Apple Watch has gotten off to a rocky start. Shipping times were quickly pushed back to June when pre-orders opened on April 10, and there are currently no models available in Apple's own retail stores.\n\nApple Watch users have also taken to Reddit and Twitter to report that wrist tattoos are disrupting the sensors found on on the bottom Watch, and some users have learned that showering wile wearing their device is not such a great idea.\n\nEven after admitting that Apple was struggling to keep up with demand, Cook noted that the company still plans to start selling the Watch in additional countries beginning in June.", "Why is Apple having such a hard time keeping up with the demand for the Apple Watch? Could it be that they are swarmed with orders? Possibly. Could it also be that they're working on a build-to-order system to prevent overproduction? That could be it too, but according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the issue with Apple's slow rollout of the Apple Watch is due to a faulty component.\n\nThe culprit in question is that of the taptic engine which is the component used inside the device to give users that buzzing sensation on their wrists whenever they receive a notification. That being said, it seems that it was only after mass production of the Apple Watch that it was discovered during reliability testing that the taptic engines began to break down over time which is obviously not a good thing after you've spent at least $350 on the device.\n\nHowever before you panic and think that maybe your device might be one of the affected units, you can rest assured that chances of that are slim. Apple apparently believes that the units they have shipped out do not contain the defective unit so you guys should be good for now, hopefully. In the meantime Apple is said to have moved production to Nidec, a Japan-based manufacturer whose units did not display the defect.\n\nPreviously some of the components were manufactured in part by AAC Technologies based out of China. However it has been noted that because Nidec will need some time to increase its production to keep up with demand, this also means that shipping times are not likely to see huge improvements anytime soon, although so far they have been improving.", "The taptic engine, designed by Apple to produce the sensation of being tapped on the wrist, is supplied by two manufacturers: China's AAC Technologies (2018.Hong Kong) and Japan's Nidec Corp (6594.Japan).\n\nAfter mass production began in February, some taptic engines supplied by AAC Technologies start to break time over time. Nidec does not seem to have any problem.\n\nApple seems to be dropping AAC Technologies and in search for a new supplier, reported Journal's colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and Lorraine Luk:\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said Apple is considering adding a second assembler of the Watch, to supplement Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc. (2382.Taiwan) Those people said Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317.Taiwan) and the main assembler of the iPhone, recently started early testing to potentially produce the Watch.\n\nThis hiccup is now creating a supply bottleneck:\n\nApple last week told some watch suppliers to slow production until June, without explaining why.\n\nApple started accepting orders for the Watch online on April 10 and began shipping watches to customers on Friday. It is selling the watch online and in select designer boutiques, but not in its own retail stores.\n\nIn a memo to retail-store employees earlier this month, Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts said stores won't get watches to sell until the end of May because of \"high global interest combined with our initial supply.\" New online orders will be delivered in June, Apple says on its website.\n\nShares of AAC Technologies are trading at 13.8 times forward earnings, in line with its 5-year historical average.

The next big thing in mobile devices: disappearables.\n\nEven as the new Apple Watch piques consumer interest in wrist-worn devices, the pace of innovation and the tumbling cost, and size, of components will make wearables smaller - so small, some in the industry say, that no one will see them.\n\nWithin five years, wearables, such as the Apple Watch, could be overtaken by hearables - devices with tiny chips and sensors that can fit inside your ear. They, in turn, could be superseded by disappearables - technology tucked inside your clothing, or even inside your body.\n\n\"In five years, when we look back, everything we see (now) will absolutely be classified as toys, as the first very basic steps of getting this right,\" says Nikolaj Hviid, the man behind smart earbuds, called The Dash.\n\nDeveloped by Munich-based Bragi GmbH, The Dash is a wireless in-ear headphone that looks like a discreet hearing aid. Packed inside is a music player, 4 gigabytes of storage, a microphone to take phone calls - just nod your head to accept - and sensors that monitor your position, heart rate and body temperature.\n\nNick Hunn, a consultant who lays claim to the term hearables, reckons The Dash is just the start. He predicts smartwatches will dominate wearable sales for the next three years, hearables will then overtake and, by 2020, will account for more than half of a US$30 billion wearable device market.\n\nThis rapid shift is being driven, he says, by a new generation of chipsets using Bluetooth wireless communication and using far less power than their predecessors. Designers now realize \"the ear has potential beyond listening to music - it's an ideal site for measuring a variety of vital signs,\" Hunn wrote in a recent report.\n\nEYEBALL POWER\n\nA parallel revolution in sensors is making this possible.\n\nKow Ping, whose Hong Kong company Well Being Digital Ltd provides algorithms and reference designs on wearable sensing to companies, such as Philips, Motorola, Haier and Parrot, says chipmakers have invested heavily in reducing the power consumption and size of sensors.\n\nAn accelerometer, which measures things like position, motion and orientation, for example, is now 1 square millimetre. \"A few years ago,\" he says, \"it was two or three times as big and two or three times less refined.\"\n\nWhen they can harvest energy from the body's heat or motion they'll be even smaller, autonomous and ubiquitous.\n\nAndrew Sheehy of Generator Research calculates that, for example, the heat in a human eyeball could power a 5 milliwatt transmitter - more than enough, he says, to power a connection from a smart contact lens to a smartphone or other controlling device.\n\nAnd Ping's company is working with a top Asian university to add sensors to a sports bra which could harvest energy from relative motion. In five years, he says, \"there will be people building sensors into every existing wearable device or apparel.\"\n\nBUTLER FEEDBACK\n\nBragi's Hviid calls these \"disappearables.\" And while medical and fitness top the list of what these devices might measure, he and others are looking beyond that. A dozen sensors in your pants, he suggests, could advise on how to improve your posture or gait when trying to impress a suitor.\n\n\"It's more like a butler ... they do some basic stuff that you really want, but there are deeper experiences in there,\" Hviid says.\n\nSheehy points beyond the personal, as parallel advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence \"come together and lead to some remarkable use cases:\" a politician's contact lens, for example, might provide real-time feedback from a sample of voters, allowing for a speech to be tweaked on the fly.\n\nA lot of this technology is already here.\n\nGoogle is working with Novartis on a contact lens to measure glucose levels in tears. The health-care group has also invested in Proteus Digital Health, a biotech start-up which promises edible embedded microchips, the size of a grain of sand, which are powered by stomach juices and transmit data via Bluetooth.\n\n\"We're looking at a major technological revolution of a similar magnitude to the mobile revolution,\" says Sheehy.\n\n'VERY TRICKY'\n\nNot everyone agrees that disappearables are necessarily just around the corner. Wearables still need to gain widespread acceptance - remember Google Glass - and the technology still needs to finessed.\n\nWhile Bragi has raised more than $3 million from crowdfunding website Kickstarter and another $10 million from angel investors, Hviid says communication problems between the left and right earbuds have delayed launch of The Dash until September. It was originally due out late last year.\n\nPing's company has been working since 2006 on wearables, and owns more than a dozen patents, but he says bringing all the technical parts together, understanding the consumer and mastering manufacturing pose a real challenge.", "Early adopters of the Apple Watch, Apple Inc's first new product in five years, complain that a number of its key functions are disrupted by their tattoos.

One Reuters reporter, Matt Siegel, demonstrated the issue on his 42mm version with stainless steel case and black classic buckle, which cost A$1,029 ($822). He has a tattoo on one wrist and found his watch locks on tattooed skin and does not deliver the soft pings that alert a user to incoming messages. \"I should be turning my wrist and every time I look at the watch I should be seeing the time of day. Once it's on my wrist once and unlocked it should stay that way, it shouldn't be locking itself ever single time,\" he said. The heart rate readings were also significantly different on the tattooed and untattooed wrists. An Apple support article says the watch uses green LED lights paired with light-sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through the wrist and calculate the frequency of heart beats. A spokesman for Apple in Sydney declined to comment on Thursday (April 30), but three Apple employees at its flagship Sydney store, including a senior advisor from its tech support line, said they were unaware of any issue. A website support page from the company says tattoos can interfere with readings from the heart rate monitor, but does not mention interference with other functions. \"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance. The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings,\" it said.", "LOS ANGELES -- A new smartphone app allows Californians who record encounters with police to automatically submit the video to their local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe ACLU said Thursday that California is the latest state where the free \"Mobile Justice\" app is available on both Apple and Android phones. The app has also been released in Oregon, Nebraska, Missouri and Mississippi, said spokeswoman Sandra Hernandez.\n\nThe technology enables users to record and upload video of law enforcement encounters so that ACLU lawyers can look for due-process violations, according to the organization. The goal is to ensure that video of potential police misconduct is preserved, even if a cellphone is tampered with or destroyed.\n\n\"The concerns over police practices, including racial profiling and excessive use of force, are very real for communities across the state,\" said Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. \"This app will help serve as a check on abuse.\"\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has said his officers always assume they're being videotaped and that the public has a right to do so as long as they're not interfering with police work.\n\nThe ACLU said those who submit videos can remain anonymous and their personal information would not be retained by the organization. Officials said the ACLU could make public the videos that are received via the app.\n\nThe recent string of controversial police killings nationwide have shown the importance of video captured by civilians, the ACLU said.\n\nCellphone video recorded the killing of a homeless man by Los Angeles police during a confrontation on Skid Row in March. The incident led to several protests. The family of Charly Leundeu Keunang this week filed a $20 million claim against the city. Authorities have said the man refused to obey their commands and reached for an officer's gun. The officers were placed on leave, pending the investigation.", "First, the technology sector gave us Google's bean bags and Facebook's feted ping-pong tables.\n\nNow these companies are raising jousting skyscrapers into the Silicon Valley skyline.\n\nFacebook has just this month moved into new headquarters designed by Frank Gehry, designer of Spain's Guggenheim Museum.\n\nIts chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, describes it as the largest open-floor plan in the world. Atop it lies a nine-acre rooftop park.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, and Apple are also creating their own new colossal headquarters.\n\nGoogle, searching for more space, will move shortly into its new \"Googleplex\".\n\nApple's \"spaceship\", a vast watchstrap fashioned like a flying saucer, has already attracted the moniker of 'death star' from the unkind.\n\nAnd Amazon's Seattle glass-dome biospheres, planned to open in 2016 and 2017, play none-too-subtly on its name.\n\nEach is a stab at capturing an imaginative futuristic high ground - and employees - from competitors.\n\nBut they also hark back to vaunted tech structures like Bell Labs' buildings and MIT's Building 20, hastily erected in 1943, but flexible and forcing people working on very different projects to meet.\n\nTech has grown out of the garage.\n\nThe audacious scale of these spaces is a bid at bettering the odds of the serendipitous encounters - bumps in Silicon Valley vernacular - which helped Building 20's occupants share ideas across specialisms.\n\nShiny new workplaces are springing up from San Francisco to Shoreditch and Shenzhen.\n\nIt 's not just technology behemoths who have embraced this way of working. The BBC's new Broadcasting House, for example, encourages hot desking, with 460 workstations in its open-plan newsroom alone.\n\nBut this brave new world of work has critics.\n\nFor some, open plan spaces suggest managers on the room's sidelines, watching workers huddled in the middle like prey on the African savannah.\n\nSeattle architecture firm NBBJ is behind the Google and Amazon buildings, as well as the new Guangdong headquarters for Chinese internet titan Tencent.\n\nOffices are moving away from the idea that time at a desk is a measure of how productive you are, says Ryan Mullenix, an NBBJ design partner, and the chief designer of the new Google building.\n\nAnd more broadly, away from ideals of industrial efficiency associated with early twentieth-century American mechanical engineer Franklin Taylor.\n\nSometimes a longer walk to get coffee may be better than a shorter one.\n\n\"It's who you see on the way to coffee, and movement which charges your brain, which is really valuable and part of work,\" says Mr Mullenix.\n\nThe social side of work may soon be the only reason we have office buildings, says Scott Wyatt, NBBJ's chairman.\n\n\"Getting together with people in teams is where innovation happens, and makes us happy,\" he says. \"You're not going to be happy holed up at home doing all your work.\"\n\n\"The company which gives the employees the choice at any given moment to optimise their effectiveness is going to win,\" says Mr Wyatt.\n\nAnd a recent all-night hackathon, where ideas are developed, sponsored by NBBJ produced an app to let employees find available working spaces nearby, arranged by variables such as light, ambient noise, and the number of people around.\n\nCrucial in all this is the new mobility which stems from more portable devices and cloud computing.\n\n\"If you sit at your desk for more than twenty minutes, you start getting stupider,\" says the chairman.\n\nHis architecture firm posts maps next to lift doors, suggesting outdoor walking routes for meetings of various lengths.\n\nTechnology, media, and telecommunications firms set trends in the future design of the office, because they are the first sectors with members of Generation X - those born from the early sixties to the early eighties - in the boardroom, says architect Nicola Gillen.\n\nShe specialises in performance and the built environment at the firm AECOM.\n\nShe says many of the newest ideas about the office trace their origin to British architect Dr Frank Duffy CBE, who in the 1960s brought Northern European ideas of flexible office landscaping (or B\u00fcrolandschaft) into the English-speaking world.\n\nInfluenced by Scandinavian egalitarianism, these theories encouraged different levels of staff to work together in non-hierarchical environments in an open floor.\n\nThey appealed to many in postwar Europe. They also seem to appeal to the youngest graduates of today.\n\nMillennials \"are used to different ways of working, sharing, and collaborating, even from an early age,\" says Elaine Rossall, head of London market research for property consultants Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nShe thinks there has been a retreat from the last decade's enthusiasm for working from home, and points to growing so-called \"worktivity\" amenities, from running tracks to social, play, and eating areas, \"to kind of keep people in the building\".\n\nThe youngest workers also are digital natives, who come into the workplace expecting to have the latest type of tech, says Paul Phillips, head of consultancy services at the workplace consultancy Assurity Consulting, based in West Sussex.\n\nHe thinks wearable technology will soon lead to new ways of presenting information about a building to its users.\n\nAnd increasingly globalised businesses and markets will spur new development in telepresence and teleconferencing, to cut costs and help the environment, he says.\n\nWith acute skill shortages in certain areas of the tech sector, to attract and retain young graduates it is increasingly important for employers to adapt to their habits, Mrs Rossall says.\n\nAnd also to where they are.\n\nMillennials have gravitated to grittier urban areas with lower housing costs, like East London.\n\nThis in turn opens up new areas of London to employers, who can draw their workforce from a different catchment.\n\nCompanies like Amazon, with its Seattle office, are moving away from suburban business parks, and back into cities.\n\n\"It's where their young and hip employees want to live, of course, but walkable urban campuses are also much more environmentally sustainable than suburban office parks,\" says Seattle-based Scott Bonjukian, who writes a blog called the Northwest Urbanist.\n\nAt the same time, he is worried this move will lead to rapidly rising rents, and lessen the very diversity of our neighbourhoods, places, and people which makes urban environments attractive.\n\nAnother challenge for designers of the future office is catering for workers from four generations, Millennials, Generations X and Y, and Baby Boomers in senior management.\n\nOpen-plan offices can be cheaper for companies to set up, by up to 20%, according to Dr Vinesh Oommen, at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nBut despite the efforts of some architects, they can easily be done badly.\n\n90% of studies found open-plan offices were associated with higher levels of stress and elevated blood pressure, Dr Oommen found.\n\nAnd older generations might particularly relish having a room of their own.\n\nMr Mullenix says whether the open office is good or bad is \"probably the wrong question\".\n\nIt is the ability to create different areas within a campus and building, catering for different working styles that is important, he says.\n\nArchitectural and design innovations quickly radiate from buildings like Google's to shape the office of the future.\n\nAnd tellingly, the tech sector has made Office a byword for software as much as bricks-and-mortar hardware.\n\nSo don't be surprised if in the future you soon find yourself working in a wifi biosphere, a deathstar, or a bean-bag.", "Clean-water advocate takes Earth Day swim in New York's Gowanus Canal, a Superfund siteMore >>\n\nJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe started a three-day visit to California on Thursday with plans to check out tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the governor.\n\nDuring a speech at Stanford, Abe said Japan needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years.\n\nHe compared the effort to Japan sending baseball players to major league baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe said he plans to meet with Google and Facebook executives and visit electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nLater in the day, the Japanese leader will head to San Francisco and invite Gov.

Interest rates? Soft macro data? Miss Scarlet in the kitchen with a lead pipe?\n\n\"I think that this market is all about Eve. Yeah, the original Eve who was tricked by the serpent into eating the forbidden Apple from the tree and the whole investor class has now been paying a price,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nInvestors were enticed to bite into the forbidden fruit and bought Apple stock ahead of earnings on Monday. As a result, Cramer now sees that the entire stock market is paying the price, and the pain will not end until Apple bottoms.\n\nGoing back to basics, investors buy stocks because they want them to report good numbers on both the top and bottom line. When the numbers are better than expected, that will trigger analysts to guide estimates higher for the stock.\n\nAnd if the company throws in a juicy dividend on top of fabulous numbers, that's even better! Not to mention if it sells at a dramatic discount to the average stock in the S&P 500.\n\nSo what the heck happened to Apple? It did all of these things, yet the stock has dropped almost 4 percent in a straight line. So basically, if Apple can't go higher, then the entire rationale to buying stocks has been flipped on its head.\n\nAnd in Cramer's perspective, that means we should have faith in nothing. Not stocks that benefit from a strong dollar, and not stocks that do well in low or high interest rate environments. Nada.\n\n\"Ever since we swallowed the Apple, the whole race of stocks seems cursed,\" Cramer said.\n\nCramer did say last week that he anticipated Apple to go down for three days after it reported, and then would try to find footing. Could this be a good time to jump in and do some buying for your portfolio? It's certainly a good time to buy a high-quality company with strong fundamentals, like Apple, regardless of whether stocks are cursed.\n\nRead MoreCramer: Stocks are cursed and it's Apple's fault\n\nFor the last few days, Cramer has been warning investors that there is a huge sea-change happening in the market. One where the weak dollar is boosting U.S. companies that do business overseas.\n\nEaton Corp is a classic industrial play with a huge exposure internationally that manufactures electrical control products, power management systems, hydraulics, truck transmissions and aerospace systems.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company managed to report a strong quarter, even though it faced headwinds from the strong dollar. It managed to offset it through a combination of cost controls and improving margins.\n\nDoes it have the strength to power higher? Cramer spoke with Eaton CEO Sandy Cutler to find out.\n\n\"I think that many companies, us too, experienced a pretty slow January and February, particularly here in the U.S. We were really pleased to see it recover in the third month of the quarter,\" Cutler said.\n\nTime and time again, Cramer has been asked the same question. Is it time to buy the oils? Prepare yourself -- Cramer is ready to make a severe judgment.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nIn Cramer's opinion, there was a time to buy oil and now that window has closed. The market heard a lot of chatter about crude on Thursday when the top dog of oil companies, Exxon-Mobil, reported numbers that weren't as weak as expected.\n\nLooking back, Cramer can see that the charts of almost all of the oils show we were at the bottom when oil was at $43.\n\nAt the same time, various distressed oil companies offered stock on the market, that turned out to be great buys. Carrizo offered 4.5 million shares at $45.50, and it's now at $55. Concho offered 6 million shares at $108, and it is now at $126.\n\n\"That's what a bottom looks like, not these actions where many of these oil stocks have now shot up to where they were when oil was at $90. That's right, $30 higher than where it is now,\" Cramer added.\n\nSo Cramer sent a warning to investors interested in the oil patch -- now is not the time to buy. You have missed the boat, do not act now.\n\nRead MoreCramer: Buy oil stocks? Don't you dare\n\nAs Cramer turns his attention to the next generation of technology, he circled back to his long-time favorite Harman International Industries.\n\nWhat the heck just happened to it?\n\nHarman is the maker of high-end audio equipment for car stereos and professional grade gear. But its core business is producing automobile infotainment systems that integrate everything in the car from navigation, safety solutions and smartphone connectivity to media and software that lets the car run.\n\n\"When you think about the connected car, you think of Harman,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nWith the car industry leaning more toward connectivity, could Harman's stock ride back into the land of profits? To find out, Cramer sat down with Harman's CEO Dinesh Paliwal.\n\n\"Harman is all about leading the connected car, the automotive space. Nothing had changed. The auto sector is very strong, we came in very strong,\" Paliwal said.\n\nRead More Cramer: Hot play on the driverless car\n\nIf there is one thing that Cramer learned about connectivity in San Francisco this week, it is that convenience is king.

The app has also been released in Oregon, Nebraska, Missouri and Mississippi, said spokeswoman Sandra Hernandez.\n\nThe technology enables users to record and upload video of law enforcement encounters so that ACLU lawyers can look for due-process violations, according to the organization. The goal is to ensure that video of potential police misconduct is preserved, even if a cellphone is tampered with or destroyed.\n\n\"The concerns over police practices, including racial profiling and excessive use of force, are very real for communities across the state,\" said Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. \"This app will help serve as a check on abuse.\"\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has said his officers always assume they're being videotaped and that the public has a right to do so as long as they're not interfering with police work.\n\nThe ACLU said those who submit videos can remain anonymous and their personal information would not be retained by the organization. Officials said the ACLU could make public the videos that are received via the app.\n\nThe recent string of controversial police killings nationwide have shown the importance of video captured by civilians, the ACLU said.\n\nCellphone video recorded the killing of a homeless man by Los Angeles police during a confrontation on Skid Row in March.

Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink, the watch would automatically lock again,\" the user wrote.", "There was a time, not so long ago, when Microsoft and computing were synonymous. Since then, Macs have carved out their own slice of the marketplace, and devices like smartphones and tablets have muddied the boundaries of the PC's reach.\n\nMicrosoft is preparing to undo all that.\n\nWe've all heard the marketing spiel about a unified user experience across Windows PCs, phones, and tablets. Microsoft's 2015 BUILD keynote assembled all the pieces into one impressive whole. This isn't just a clever line for an ad campaign, it's a comprehensive attempt to turn Windows from an OS into multi-platform ecosystem.\n\nMillions of people around the world use Windows for work and at home. However, with the concept of the PC becoming more intangible, Microsoft is clearly aware it could eventually be in trouble if it doesn't expand. Windows needs to become more than just the OS most use on their PC. Microsoft has known that for years, but now it actually has a workable plan to achieve its goal.\n\nBringing developers on board\n\nMicrosoft wants to offer the same experience to Windows users on their phones and tablets as experienced by those on their desktop computer. A similar experience isn't enough. Only the real thing will suffice, as proven by Continuum. The devices will matter less and less, because they're simply conduits to give users access to Windows.\n\nJust as you can upload a clip of your best performance in Halo directly from your Xbox One to your OneDrive, or sync a tidbit from OneNote across your phone, tablet and laptop, expect to see your Windows devices become increasingly intertwined. Some might find the trend annoying, but many will love how it makes common tasks easier.\n\nAny platform is only as good as the software that can be used on it, and that's why Windows is way behind in mobile.\n\nMicrosoft made sure to push this movement heavily at BUILD, because the developers in attendance are the ones who will make the company's vision a reality. Any platform is only as good as the software that can be used on it, and Microsoft are going wide in the hopes of delivering as much quality content to their users as is possible.\n\nRelated: Microsoft's new browser is officially named Edge, supports Chrome and Firefox extensions\n\nWe saw plenty of different coding languages producing software for a host of devices during Microsoft's BUILD keynote, and that wasn't any coincidence. Whether it's offering up a more open version of the Office suite with support for custom-made add-ins, or providing an Android emulator as part of Visual Studio, Microsoft is designing tools to make Windows the home of development.\n\nBeyond that, there's the key element of crossover between Windows 10 on all platforms. Microsoft wants to make it as easy as possible for development to cover PCs, tablets and phones. That goal is to make programming for Windows more appealing, and thus populate the Windows Store with the sort of apps users want to download.\n\nEngaging the audience\n\nWith developers committed to the advantages Windows allows them, Microsoft can aggressively court consumers. A well-stocked Store will tempt Windows emigrates back to the OS, and there is already a plan to keep them on board afterwards.\n\nTake Cortana, for instance. Personal assistant software still seems likely to capture the imagination of the mainstream, but Microsoft's version seems to have an underpinning that ties into their aim of broadening the reach of Windows as a whole. Cortana has been touted as an assistant that will learn about user's habits and interests to deliver the best possible service. We saw a slight twist on that idea in Microsoft's BUILD keynote, where Joe Belfiore explained some changes to the Windows Lock Screen.\n\nThe new Spotlight feature will expand upon promotional efforts to publicize Windows Store content. Users will be able to tell their device what interests them and what doesn't, similar to the system currently in place as part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview to customize Lock Screen wallpapers.\n\nOn the surface, it's a minor point, but Belfiore's wording when demonstrating the functionality might illuminate its greater purpose. He referred to users teaching their device about their preferences, which suggests much more of a relationship than simply checking a box in the Control Panel.\n\nMicrosoft is attempting to develop the relationship between users and the Windows OS over time. Between a work PC, a tablet for recreational use and a smartphone, users will be able to train Windows to fit into their life just as they desire. And once that's done, it'll be hard for said users to jump to another OS.\n\nCapturing the future\n\nMicrosoft is looking to the future while keeping its focus on real world applications. And if that's not interesting enough, well, the company has HoloLens in its back pocket when it needs to deliver the wow factor.\n\nMaybe, in 10 years, we'll use holograms as casually as touch screens are engaged with today. Maybe not. But it's something for Windows users to look forward to.\n\nAccessing your Excel spreadsheets from your phone is undoubtedly practical, but it doesn't have the same impact that interacting with a virtual dinosaur skeleton does. Technology needs a little spectacle to grab the consumer's attention, and Microsoft have delivered just that alongside their more functional developments.\n\nRelated: Windows 10 isn't just a step back to the desktop, it's a step up\n\nMaybe, in 10 years, we'll use holograms as casually as touch screens are engaged with today. Maybe not. The point is, it's something for Windows users to look forward to. It signifies that Microsoft has ideas for the future. That's key if consumers are going to evangelize for Microsoft the way others do for Apple and Google.\n\nMicrosoft wants to make Windows more all-encompassing than ever before, going beyond the PC platform to deliver a truly device-agnostic service. That desire isn't just about technology. It's about recapturing the pioneer spirit that launched the company to the top 40 years ago.", "It seems that the Apple Watch and arm tattoos don't get along in what's already been dubbed #TattooGate.\n\nAccording to Reuters, tattoo ink wreaks havoc with the Apple Watch sensors, disrupting a number of its key functions.\n\n\"Turns out people with wrist tattoos will be unable to use Apple Watch for Apple Pay because it can't sense you're alive.

Anything that reduces that light's reflectiveness -- ink pigmentation within your skin, for example -- can interfere with that sensor.\"\n\nOne solution to the issue is to turn off \"Wrist Detection\" in the Apple Watch app, which will prevent the device from auto-locking, but it also switches off Apple Pay, which won't help users like Steve T-S.\n\nOf course, another more obvious resolution to the problem is to wear the Watch on your other wrist, if it's not tattooed.\n\nTattoos aren't the only potential issue for the Apple Watch's sensors.\n\n\"It's also worth noting that prominent scars and other potential skin aberrations can trip the Watch's sensors,\" iMore added.\n\nEven if wrist ink isn't an issue for you, check out \"5 Reasons NOT to Buy an Apple Watch.\"\n\nAre you an Apple Watch owner?

But in the case of Apple, a stock Cramer owns for his charitable trust, Action Alerts PLUS, the company did all of those things and shares have fallen in a straight line ever since.\n\n\"I see things out there I just don't like,\" Cramer told viewers. If the markets won't reward Apple for posting one of the best quarters in corporate history, then the rest of the markets are in trouble.\n\nThe exact scenario was seen through today's session, with Yelp shares slammed 23% on its earnings release, LinkedIn posting a massive 24% decline on its earnings and AmerisourceBergen giving back nearly all of its gains after it reported.\n\nWhat could help stem these declines? Oil could stop going higher, or the sellers could just fizzle out eventually, or perhaps new leadership could emerge. The banks maybe?

Profit was up from $46.5 million the year before.\n\nGoogle Australia and New Zealand managing director Maile Carnegie. Photo: Christopher Pearce\n\nBut its tax bill is only a fraction of its Australian profits, which don't count for more than $2 billion worth of income it earns through advertising locally on its lucrative search engine business.\n\nGoogle is among a number of technology companies - including Apple, Microsoft, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto - that are under audit by the Australian Taxation Office for their use of marketing hubs in Singapore.\n\n\"We've invested nearly $1 billion dollars in Australia over the last three years, employing a local workforce of 1200 people,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"There is always more we can do, but we are deeply committed to providing great products for Australians, and supporting our customers here.\"\n\nGoogle, headquartered in the United States, says it global corporate tax rate is 19 per cent for 2014, and it incurred taxes of $3.3 billion.\n\nIts Australian arm claimed $4.9 million in the research and development tax offset.\n\nThe company said it paid $19.7 million in payroll and \"other\" taxes such as fringe benefits in Australia.\n\nGoogle Australia's managing director, Maile Carnegie, recently told the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance that their tax arrangements were well within the law.\n\nThere are estimates Google's tax rate in Singapore is as low as 10 per cent.\n\nMs Carnegie did not confirm how much tax the company paid in the island nation, but confirmed to the inquiry earlier this month that the tax generated from Google's advertising revenue, is paid in Singapore.\n\n\"Google Australia provides sales and marketing services to Google Singapore, and we get basically revenue for those services,\" she said in evidence to the inquiry.\n\nBut Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan later gave evidence disputing the claims made by Google and the other companies under audit who had given testimony.\n\nHe said that while Google paid some tax in Singapore, \"we believe it's a very small amount as revenue booked in Singapore is moved to a tax haven, Bermuda, through a series of licensing fee payments\".\n\n\"This means the majority of profits made in Australia end up in Bermuda where no tax is paid.\"\n\nMr Jordan - who pledged the agency will beat a budget target of hitting $1.1 billion in revenue from multinationals by 2017 - expects to finalise audits by the end of the year.\n\nSo far the ATO has raised $250 million in liabilities through audits of multinationals, but this amount does not include the 12 tech companies under audit.\n\nIn the meantime, the Abbott government wants to work with the United Kingdom to implement interim measures to tax multinationals. It could announce new measures in the May budget, just months before the OECD hands down its final plan.\n\nThe OECD has been tasked by G20 governments to deliver a plan that stops companies profit shifting. This plan is due by October, but the immense public pressure mounting on political leaders to act fast, means that they could move sooner in introducing or beefing up domestic tax laws.\n\nMs Carnegie told the inquiry she was against the federal government taking unilateral action. \"It will add more complexity and more uncertainty and will lead to less innovation and less growth and job creation,\" she said.", "Rep. Ted Lieu lambasts gov't request for more access to encrypted devices.\n\nDespite the best efforts of law enforcement to convince a Congressional subcommittee that technology firms actually need to weaken encryption in order to serve the public interest, lawmakers were not having it.\n\nDaniel Conley, the district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, testified Wednesday before the committee that companies like Apple and Google were helping criminals by hardening encryption on their smartphones. He echoed previous statements by the recently-departed Attorney General, Eric Holder.\n\n\"In America, we often say that none of us is above the law,\" Conley wrote in his prepared testimony. \"But when unaccountable corporate interests place crucial evidence beyond the legitimate reach of our courts, they are in fact placing those who rape, defraud, assault and even kill in a position of profound advantage over victims and society.\"\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who described himself as a \"recovering computer science major,\" provided one of the most forceful counter-arguments. (He is just one of four House members with computer science degrees.) Lieu also is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves and served for four years as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps.\n\n\"It is clear to me that creating a pathway for decryption only for good guys is technologically stupid, you just can't do that,\" he said, underscoring that he found Conley's remarks \"offensive.\"\n\nHe argued:\n\nIt's a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. Why do you think Apple and Google are doing this? It's because the public is demanding it. People like me: privacy advocates. A public does not want a an out of surveillance state. It is the public that is asking for this. Apple and Google didn't do this because they thought they would make less money. This is a private sector response to government overreach.\n\nThen you make another statement that somehow these companies are not credible because they collect private data. Here's the difference: Apple and Google don't have coercive power. District attorneys do, the FBI does, the NSA does, and to me it's very simple to draw a privacy balance when it comes to law enforcement and privacy: just follow the damn Constitution.\n\nAnd because the NSA didn't do that and other law enforcement agencies didn't do that, you're seeing a vast public reaction to this. Because the NSA, your colleagues, have essentially violated the Fourth Amendment rights of every American citizen for years by seizing all of our phone records, by collecting our Internet traffic, that is now spilling over to other aspects of law enforcement. And if you want to get this fixed, I suggest you write to NSA: the FBI should tell the NSA, stop violating our rights. And then maybe you might have much more of the public on the side of supporting what law enforcement is asking for.\n\nThen let me just conclude by saying I do agree with law enforcement that we live in a dangerous world. And that's why our founders put in the Constitution of the United States -- that's why they put in the Fourth Amendment. Because they understand that an Orwellian overreaching federal government is one of the most dangerous things that this world can have. I yield back.\n\nFundamental misunderstanding\n\nWhen Ars contacted Lieu after the Wednesday hearing he said that he was not surprised at the testimony of Conley and others in law enforcement.\n\n\"They have a job to do and it is in their interest to make access to data by law enforcement as easy as possible,\" he told Ars by e-mail.\n\n\"But I was surprised at their rhetoric stating that companies seeking to protect and encrypt Americans' data from unconstitutional government intrusion are implicitly helping terrorists and criminals,\" he said. \"That view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue. Private-sector technology companies are responding to the American people's demand that our current out-of-control surveillance state be brought under control.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on his \"technologically stupid\" comment regarding backdoors, Lieu wrote:\n\nBackdoors create unnecessary vulnerability to otherwise secure systems that can be exploited by bad actors. Backdoors are also problematic because once one government asks for special treatment, then other governments with fewer civil liberties protections will start asking for special treatment. In addition, computer code is neutral and unthinking. It cannot tell if the person typing on a keyboard trying to access private data is the FBI Director, a hacker, or the leader of Hamas as long as that person has the cryptographic key or other unlocking code. The view that computer backdoors can only be used by \"good guys\" reflects a lack of understanding of basic computer technology.\n\nBut, when asked what steps Lieu takes in his personal or professional life to protect his digital security, he simply responded: \"That's private.\"\n\nThe entire hearing, which runs two hours and 15 minutes, is viewable below.", "Amidst torrential downpours and a brisk breeze, the Campbell River Comets Track and Field Club, along with the Campbell River Christian School track team, competed in the second annual \"Candy Apple\" Cross-Country Relay Race on Tuesday evening.

On Tuesday, the messaging service reported revenue and offered an outlook that fell short of Wall Street's expectation. On top of that, investors had been rattled when Twitter's earnings report came out inadvertently nearly an hour ahead of schedule.\n\nThe sharp declines came amid a particularly bad week for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was down some 3 percent this week, on pace for its worst week this year. Tech darling Apple seems to be the biggest culprit for the drop. Its shares fell 2.7 percent on Thursday and are down nearly 4 percent for the week.\n\nNot even Facebook seems immune to the dump, even with last week's solid earnings report behind it. Its shares are down 3.4 percent for the week, although they are up about 1 percent for the year.\n\nThe double-digit stock declines at Twitter and LinkedIn show that investors have little patience for weakness in highly valued social media stocks. Twitter attributed its revenue shortfall to weaker-than-expected contributions from some of its newer advertising products. The shortfall came at a time investors were looking for stronger advertising growth to make up for less-than-stellar user numbers. Without either, investor confidence was shaken.\n\nSterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said he wasn't surprised that Wall Street reacted severely, given Twitter's high share price valuation and - at least until this week - its strong performance this year.\n\nLinkedIn, whose high-flying stock has been battered for far less than Thursday's weak outlook, gave investors a rare negative surprise. It said its weak view resulted from changes in currency exchange rates, costs of its pending acquisition of Lynda.com and other items. The $1.5 billion deal announced earlier this month is the largest in LinkedIn's history.\n\nFor the current quarter, Mountain View, California-based LinkedIn expects adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share on revenue of $670 million to $675 million. Analysts were forecasting much higher adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $719 million, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Lynda acquisition is expensive, but LinkedIn is \"building a great long-term business,\" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.\n\nHe also said there's often a sharp market reaction to LinkedIn's earnings, with the stock moving at least 6 percent after results came out in the past eight quarters and 10 percent or more in half of them.\n\nOn Thursday, however, the reaction was far more extreme, The company's stock tumbled $63.93, or 25 percent, to $188.20 in extended trading. The stock had closed down 2 percent.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It does everything Google Authenticator can do, and more.\n\nA password is a terrible way to protect an online account, because anybody who learns your password owns the account, even if they're half a world away. A password manager lets you use tough-to-remember passwords, but in a data breach it doesn't matter if your password was \"*txE6xVy$rjMO@0t\" or \"password.\" You can vastly enhance your security by using a two-factor authentication scheme, and Twilio's Authy makes two-factor authentication easier than ever.\n\nExperts divide authentication factors into three types: something you know (a password, for example), something you have (a physical object), and something you are (a fingerprint or other biometric trait). Authy turns your smartphone into a physical token that's needed for login, along with the password. A hacker who steals or guesses your password will be foiled by the authentication step that requires that token.\n\nHow It Works\n\nIn 2011, the Internet Engineering Task Force released a standard for Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). The concept is simple enough. When the user registers a TOTP-supporting device with a secure website, a unique shared key is created. Both the device and the server can generate a time-based one-time password by processing that key along with the current time. By convention, each TOTP is good for 30 seconds. You log in using your regular password, then enter the current one-time password from your device, and you're in. A malefactor who somehow plucks that one-time password out of the ether will find it useless within 30 seconds.\n\nAuthy and Google Authenticator both build on TOTP, and in fact you can use Authy on any site that supports Google Authenticator. Why would you switch to Authy? There are quite a few reasons; I'll go into detail later.\n\nGetting Started With Authy\n\nSetting up Authy to use your smartphone as a token is simple. You install the Authy app on the phone, give it your phone number, and either click a verification link or enter a verification code. That's it; Authy is ready to use. Getting started on my Apple iPhone 6 took almost no time.\n\nThe exact technique for setting up two-factor authentication varies from site to site. However, for most sites you'll follow the prompts until you get a chance to select Google Authenticator. At that point, the site displays a QR code. Snap the QR code with Authy and bam! You've got two-factor authentication. Digging into the app, I found that it directly supports at least two dozen popular sites, among them Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, Lastpass, Evernote, and WordPress. Over 10,000 other websites and applications, large and small, use Authy directly for authentication, with no connection to Google Authenticator.\n\nYour registered sites appear across the bottom of the app's window. Tapping one brings up the current authentication code for that site, along with a countdown timer that shows how much of the code's 30-second lifetime remains. It works much the same on Android and iOS, though I observed that the iOS edition displays a circular progress bar with a label counting down seconds while the Android edition just uses a simple progress bar.\n\nOf course, if a hacker with pocket-picking skills manages to obtain both your password and your authentication smartphone, you could be in trouble. As with the strictly device-based security used by oneID, you need to secure your device thoroughly. Use a strong passcode, or biometric authentication, and turn on Authy's PIN protection (iPhone users can upgrade to Touch ID authentication).\n\nLastPass 3.0 and LastPass 3.0 Premium both support Google Authenticator. That means you can protect your LastPass account using Authy, and then go on to use Authy for two-factor authentication of your other secure sites. You could do the same with Dashlane 3.\n\nMulti-Device Features\n\nYou need a smartphone to get started with Authy, but once that task is accomplished you can install Authy on other smartphones, tablets, or desktops, and sync data between the devices. Authy supports iOS, Android, and BlackBerry mobile devices, as well as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. There's even an Authy app for the Apple Watch; just glance at your wrist for the authentication code.\n\nBy installing the Authy desktop app and Chrome extension, you can bypass the smartphone altogether. The desktop app prompts you to create a master password, but doesn't require it (an oversight, in my opinion). Note that the master password is device-specific, so if you install on multiple desktops you could conceivably create multiple master passwords. When the master password is in place, the app requires you to re-enter it periodically. Using the Chrome extension, you can get the current code for any of your registered sites, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it in, with no need to get out your phone.\n\nYes, this is definitely chipping away at the definition of two-factor authentication. Someone who has access to your desktop computer could conceivably break in, because the desktop computer becomes the \"something you have\" factor. If you choose to use the Authy desktop app, you absolutely must protect it with a strong master password. In addition, you should password-protect your user account on the desktop and lock the account any time you step away.\n\nThere's another benefit to the Chrome extension that I didn't notice right away. If you click to view the current code for a site, and that site isn't open, you'll get a phishing warning. That's handy!\n\nEnabling Authy on another smartphone or tablet is a snap. On the new device, you enter the phone number of your smartphone, and respond to an access prompt that appears on that smartphone. Just like that, Authy is enabled on the new device.\n\nLost a device? You can use the Authy app to remove that device from the sync process. Note, though, that for sites using Google's implementation of TOTP the token will continue to supply codes for already-registered sites. A prudent user will disable and re-enable two-factor authentication on these sites.\n\nIf you've enrolled all the devices you want, you can set Authy to stop accepting more devices. There's also an option to save an encrypted backup of your secure keys to the cloud.\n\nI noticed a Bluetooth option in the Authy iOS app. I enabled it, but couldn't find any way to make it interact with my PC. It turns out this feature is Mac-specific, and that even on Mac it's having trouble with some recent changes in Bluetooth implementation.\n\nWhy Authy?\n\nI mentioned earlier that you can use Authy on any site that supports Google Authenticator. But why would you bother? Well, Authy is just better in a number of ways.\n\nWhen you set up an account to authenticate via Google Authenticator, your access to that account on mobile devices is cut off. You must enter a lengthy all-lowercase \"application password\" to re-enable access for each application on each device. Authy users can simply install Authy on the device, obviating the need for this annoying process.\n\nIf you get a new phone, you can easily transfer over all of your Authy registrations. With Google Authenticator, you'd have to go through the registration process again for every site. And Google Authenticator doesn't offer any way to revoke access for a lost or stolen phone.\n\nThe whole concept of time-based passwords breaks down if the client and server aren't synchronized time-wise. Authy has a reputation for staying in sync even when your device doesn't have network access, more so than Google Authenticator. However, I didn't find a way to test this.", "The Joy of Tech is a comic about technology and pop culture, created by Nitrozac and Snaggy, and updated three times a week.

Could it be that the Apple Watch components cost more which is why Apple needs to charge more just so they can turn a profit?\n\nMaybe not because according to a report from IHS Technology (via VentureBeat), it turns out that the Apple Watch's components cost a total of $81.20. Throwing in an extra $2.50 for manufacturing costs, it brings the total to $83.70. According to IHS, this makes the Apple Watch have the highest markup amongst Apple's products so far.\n\nThe most expensive component according to them is the display which costs $20.50 for the Ion-X version. No word on how much the sapphire or Edition bodies cost. That being said how accurate IHS' estimates is unclear. A few days ago, Apple's CEO Tim Cook addressed reports of cost breakdowns, claiming that so far none of the breakdowns he's seen about any of their products is close to what the reality is.\n\nWe suppose it is entirely plausible given that Apple might get cheaper components because of the amount of orders they place. There are also other factors to take into consideration, such as the hours put into manufacturing the product in which salaries needs to be paid. There is also the process of designing the product, testing it, and also marketing it, all of which have costs that need to be factored into the final price as well.", "Fancy tuning your guitar with a watch?

Growth is anemic, most companies are coming short of revenue estimates and guidance continues to be on the weak side, causing estimates for the current period to come down.\n\nThe strong U.S. dollar has widely been blamed for the Q1 weakness. The 'dollar scapegoating' makes sense, particularly when we compare the results of large-cap companies with small-cap operators. The large-cap companies in the S&P 500 index have substantial exposure to currency issues. After all, they earn an estimated 40% of their revenues from beyond the U.S. shores. Smaller companies aren't entirely focused on the domestic market either, but they have a lot less international exposure.\n\nYou can see this divergence in the contrasting Q1 revenue performance of the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 companies. While an unusually high proportion of S&P 500 members are coming short of consensus revenue estimates, the issue isn't that pronounced with the Russell 2000 members. We should keep in mind however that while we are quite further along in the reporting cycle for the large-cap index (68.7% of S&P 500 members have already reported results, as of April 30th), we are still at a relatively early stage for the small-caps (37.5% of Russell 2000 members have reported results).\n\nThe S&P 500 Scorecard\n\nIncluding this afternoon's results from the likes of Gilead ( GILD ), Visa ( V ), Expedia ( EXPE ) and others, we now have Q1 results from 344 S&P 500 members that combined account for 76% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 344 companies are up +5.9% from the period last year, with 66.1% beating earnings estimates. Total revenues for these companies are down -3.5% from the same period last year, with only 38.8% beating top-line estimates.\n\nHere is the current scorecard for the 344 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, as of 5:30 Eastern on April 30th.\n\nThis is weak performance compared to what we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters, as the side-by-side charts below shows.\n\nThe left-hand side chart compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for these 344 S&P 500 members with what these same companies reported in the preceding quarter and the average growth rates for these companies in the preceding four quarters (the 4-quarter average is through 2014 Q4). The right-hand side chart does the same comparison for these 344 S&P 500 members, but compares only the earnings and revenue beat ratios.\n\nHere are the takeaways from looking at these comparison charts\n\nThe earnings growth rate (+5.9%) is decent enough, but is weaker relative to other recent periods. The earnings growth comparison becomes extremely lopsided once the Finance sector's strong growth numbers are excluded (the chart below shows the Q1 growth comparison with and without FinanceThe revenue growth rate -3.5%) is notably below what we saw from this group of companies in Q4 (+1.2%) as well as in the 4-quarter average (+3%).The earnings beat ratio is about in-line with the recent past.The revenue beat ratio is notably below what these same companies reported in the preceding as well as 4-quarter average.\n\nThe Russell 2000 Scorecard\n\nIncluding all of the reports after the market close, we now have Q1 results from 748 Russell 2000 members that combined account for 43.7% of the small-cap index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these Russell members are up +15% from the same period last year on +5.9% higher revenues, with 43.7% beating earnings estimates and 35.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nHere is the current scorecard for the 745 Russell 2000 companies that have reported results already\n\nThis is modestly better performance than we have seen from the same group of 432 Russell 2000 members in other recent periods, as the charts below show.\n\nThe most notable takeaway from the Russell 2000 comparison chart above is the revenue beat ratio. Revenues are weak both for the S&P 500 as well as the Russell 2000, but the magnitude of weakness is notably higher for the large-cap index. The chart below focuses solely on the beat ratio by doing a side-by-side comparison of beat ratios for the two indexes.\n\nThe Bottom line\n\nThe relatively favorable reporting season for the Russell 2000 members does not mean that the overall earnings picture isn't weak - it is fairly weak. While a number of the Russell members will eventually generate a lot of earnings and make it to the large-cap index at some stage in the future, but the magnitude of their current earnings pale in comparison to what the large-caps make. All of the Russell 2000 members combined will earn roughly equal to what Apple ( AAPL ) earned on its own in Q1. That said, the small-caps do have an advantage in limited exposure to the strong U.S. dollar.\n\nFor a detailed look at the Q1 earnings season, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report .\n\nNote : Want more articles from this author?

Royal Dutch Shell reported an increase because last year's results were weighed down by one-time \u00adcharges.\n\nExxon's production in the first quarter rose 2 percent from a year ago as energy flowed from new projects in the United States and Papua New Guinea, so the profit plunge was almost entirely due to lower prices.\n\nExxon lost money on exploration and production in the United States -- a segment from which it had earned $1.2 billion a year earlier. Production outside the United States remained profitable, but earnings fell by more than half. Refining and marketing earnings rose.\n\n\u25cf The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid plummeted to its lowest level in 15 years last week, evidence that employers are laying off few workers despite a sharp slowdown in economic growth.

The messaging service on Tuesday reported revenue and offered an outlook that fell short of Wall Street's expectation. On top of that, investors were rattled when Twitter's earnings report came out inadvertently nearly an hour ahead of schedule.\n\nThe sharp declines came amid a particularly bad stretch for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was down some 3 percent this week, on pace for its worst week this year. Tech darling Apple seems to be the biggest culprit for the drop. Its shares fell 2.7 percent on Thursday and are down nearly 4 percent for the week.\n\nNot even Facebook seems immune to the sell-off, even with last week's solid earnings report behind it. Its shares are down 3.4 percent for the week, although they are up about 1 percent for the year.\n\nThe double-digit stock declines at Twitter and LinkedIn show that investors have little patience for weakness in highly valued social media stocks. Twitter attributed its revenue shortfall to weaker-than-expected contributions from some of its newer advertising products. The shortfall came at a time investors were looking for stronger advertising growth to make up for less-than-stellar user numbers. Without either, investor confidence was shaken.\n\nSterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said he wasn't surprised that Wall Street reacted severely, given Twitter's high share price valuation and -- at least until this week -- its strong performance this year.\n\nLinkedIn, whose high-flying stock has been battered for far less than Thursday's weak outlook, gave investors a rare negative surprise. It said its weak view resulted from changes in currency exchange rates, costs of its pending acquisition of Lynda.com and other items. The $1.5 billion deal announced earlier this month is the largest in LinkedIn's history.\n\nFor the current quarter, Mountain View, California-based LinkedIn expects adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share on revenue of $670 million to $675 million. Analysts were forecasting much higher adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $719 million, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Lynda acquisition is expensive, but LinkedIn is \"building a great long-term business,\" said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis.\n\nHe also said there's often a sharp market reaction to LinkedIn's earnings, with the stock moving at least 6 percent after results came out in the past eight quarters and 10 percent or more in half of them.\n\nOn Thursday, however, the reaction was far more extreme, The company's stock tumbled $52.83 to $199.30 in extended trading. The stock had closed down 2 percent in the regular trading session before the earnings report.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If so, they were mistaken.\n\nHouse reps on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee tore into the Feds' demands for skeleton keys to decrypt citizens' private files.\n\nThe panel met on Wednesday to question law enforcement and technology experts about the FBI's proposals for backdoors in encryption. Cryptographers say it is impossible to build secure encryption systems that only allow Uncle Sam in and keep hackers out.\n\nUnusually, the committee has not one but two members who actually know something about technology. Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is one of only four US congressfolk who holds a computer science degree, and Representative Will Hurd (R-TX) is a former CIA agent who ran a cybersecurity company before being elected.\n\nBoth congressmen listened as Daniel Conley, district attorney of Massachusetts, called on Congress to ban Apple and Google's on-by-default file encryption in cellphones. Conley said the technology was aiding child pornographers, terrorists and, rather bizarrely, people who take upskirt photos of women on public transport.\n\n\"In America, we often say that none of us is above the law,\" Conley said [transcript PDF]. \"But when unaccountable corporate interests place crucial evidence beyond the legitimate reach of our courts, they are in fact placing those who rape, defraud, assault and even kill in a position of profound advantage over victims and society.\"\n\nHis colleague Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI's science and technology branch, claimed [transcript PDF] that rapists, child abusers, and terrorists, were piling into encryption. Agents' monitoring was \"going dark\" thanks to encryption, she added. Hess wants backdoors added to security software source code to allow access to data on demand - with a warrant, of course.\n\nYoutube video\n\nThese demands cut little ice with the committee, which roasted both speakers over the technical impossibility of their plans, and had some choice words about the practices used by law enforcement to surveil and track suspects.\n\n\"Why do you think Apple and Google are doing this? It's because the public is demanding it. A public does not want an out-of-control surveillance state,\" Lieu said.\n\n\"Apple and Google don't have coercive power. District attorneys do, the FBI does, the NSA does, and to me it's very simple to draw a privacy balance when it comes to law enforcement and privacy: just follow the damn Constitution. And because the NSA didn't do that and other law enforcement agencies didn't do that, you're seeing a vast public reaction to this.\"\n\nHurd said that there were already hacking tools that could be used by agents that worked, recounting how when he was a network penetration tester for banks he would always offer to either charge a fee, or be allowed to keep what he could steal. No one took the second option because he always got in.\n\nHe said the FBI and cops should be held to a higher standard when it came to civil liberties. He promised the committee would be watching the FBI's proposals \"very carefully\" to make sure privacy isn't trampled underfoot.\n\nHis colleague Representative Blake Farenthold (R-TX) also took the chance to put the boot in. He asked the panel of experts if anyone knew of a \"gold standard\" encryption system that could be backdoored - no one raised their hands.\n\nWhile the bulk of the session covered encryption, Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) asked Hess point blank if it is possible for the FBI to track people's location using their cellphones without a warrant. After offering to brief him privately on the matter twice, she admitted that yes, it is possible.\n\nAll in all it was a chastening and somewhat sore session for the Feds. It's also clear that, with elections not too far off, Congress seems to be understanding that the voting public is peeved at privacy invasions by the state. \u00ae", "The Apple Watch is a statement in more ways than one; aside from a few minor quibbles, it shows a lot of promise.\n\nThe Apple Watch experience, more than that of any other Apple product, is defined by details. Some are amazing and genuinely delightful, while others remind you that Apple's foray into a new category of computing is still a first-generation product.\n\nA few of those details became immediately apparent to me in a week of wearing and using the watch. The build quality, materials, and (dare I say about a product produced in the millions of units?) craftsmanship of the Apple Watch are stunning. On the wrist the thickness doesn't feel bulky, as many of the side-on photos suggest.\n\nMany people will gloss right over the appearance, but before shrugging those observations off as just fashion or eye candy, remember that the watch is a deliberate visual statement. To sell a watch -- any watch -- to potentially millions of people is to sell fashion, because it's always visible on your wrist, not tucked into a purse or pocket like a phone.\n\nUnlike with mechanical watches, the watch's display is usually off to conserve battery power. When you raise your wrist, the face lights up to reveal a crisp, high resolution Retina screen. The quality is impressive: The smooth animation of the second hand on one of the faces prompted a friend to exclaim, \"That doesn't look digital at all.\" That raise-to-wake motion has worked well in my experience, but the screen goes back to sleep too quickly.\n\nMy battery concerns evaporated when I accidentally left the watch on overnight, and didn't charge it until it was down to 12 percent -- 36 hours since the previous charge.\n\nMore small software details add up: Ten watch faces are available, most with options to customize the \"complications\" (a traditional watch term for added functions), but you can also use those to create ready-made versions for specific activities, like the Simple face with a stopwatch and time instead of the current temperature and activity level.\n\nOne amusing (to me) option is the ability to set the clock ahead, for people who habitually run late.\n\nHowever, don't expect to intuit the interface right away. Aside from checking the time, two features you'll use most are Notifications and Glances. Responding to notifications as they arrive is quick, thanks to pre-made responses and Siri dictation, which I'd say has worked well for me about 80 percent of the time.\n\nYou can also swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal all notifications, like the iPhone. Glances are quick peeks into some apps' data, which appear when you swipe from the bottom of the screen.\n\nBut those swipes work only when you're viewing the watch face, not within apps or on the Home screen, which displays apps as a flotilla of soap bubbles. The mental model you construct to make up for lack of visual cues for those features isn't consistent throughout the experience.\n\nAfter almost a week of using the watch, I also still forget that many functions, like clearing everything in the Notification list, are available via Force Touch, which involves actually pressing harder (not longer) on the screen.\n\nAnd then there are little rough-edge details that have cropped up the longer I use the watch. Pressing the side button brings up the friends screen, but it can display only 12 names. And that screen is the only way to access the Digital Touch features like tapping, drawing doodles, or sending your heartbeat to someone else with an Apple Watch.\n\nMany apps suffer quite a bit of lag when communicating with their counterparts on the iPhone, and sometimes the watch doesn't realize its own abilities. For example, you can tap the Mail app from the Home screen to check your email, but if you ask Siri if you have any new messages, it tells you to use the Handoff feature to open the Mail app on the iPhone.\n\nEven Apple, with its enormous success, design sensibility, and massive research and development efforts, still creates 1.0 versions of software that need to be shaken out in the real world.\n\nAll that said, I like the Apple Watch quite a bit, and see a lot of promise in it. I purchased a 42 mm aluminum Apple Watch Sport, but every model, regardless of case or cost, is equal in the eyes of software. These issues are all things that can be worked out in software updates.", "EDITORS' PICKS\n\nBest New Beach-Fashion Boutique: Fugate's Sarasota\n\nImagine a boutique in posh St. Barts but without the eye-popping price tags.

Microsoft \"Edge\" is the new web browser announced by the company for Windows 10, which its exponents claimed would give a new experience to millions of internet users. \"I am really excited about where we are in this journey,\" Indian-American Nadella told the Microsoft developers community at the company?s flagship annual event Build 2015 as his team unveiled details of the Windows 10, which is being highly anticipated by people. \"Windows 10 is a new generation of windows. It is built for new era of personal computers. It is built for variety of devices. It?s also build with a foundation of trust. It?s a very different windows in terms of how we deliver, how we keep it alive. It?s one unified store,\" Nadella said in his key note address to the Build 2015 event, being attended by developers from across the world. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Executive VP, Operating Systems said with Windows 10 the company is targeting the broadest device ever. \"We are talking about one platform, wherein a single app can run across all devices. Windows is the only echo system wherein you get to develop an app across all the systems,\" he said. Windows 10, after it is launched, he said, would be free for upgrade. Within two-three years of Windows 10 release, there would be one billion devices running Windows 10. This would make Windows 10 much ahead of its other competitors from Apple and Google operating systems. In his address, Nadella said Microsoft was founded by two developers some 40 years ago with the bold ambition to empower other developers to build new and great things. \"In the 40 years, a lot of devices have come and gone. But what has remained constant is the ethos is that we are a developer company and a platform company first,\" he said. Facing challenges from companies like Google and Apple, Nadella promised to take Microsoft to a new level by launching new products, adding more features to the existing products and making it available across all kinds of devices. \"We're going to want all developers exploit and take advantage of the platform of the conference,\" he said. \"When we talk about empowering every person it starts with empowering every developer on the planet,\" he added. He also related his personal stories of ordinary people to narrate his ideas and vision of the company.", "By BRANDON BAILEY and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writers\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- It's an annoying problem for the unlucky few: the Apple Watch's heart rate monitor and even some other features might not work if you have a tattoo on your wrist.\n\nInked and irked Apple fans have dubbed the issue \"TattooGate\" on Twitter, complaining that they must choose between their body art and their stylish gadget. Apple, for its part, acknowledged the issue on its support website.\n\n\"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance,\" the site reads. \"The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\"\n\nSeveral watch owners complained about the problem on social media this week, even posting videos that show the watch working well on an undecorated wrist, but repeatedly locking or pausing when worn on an arm with a tattoo. Some said it appeared the watch's screen-lock feature was triggering because the sensors thought the watch was not sitting on their wrist.\n\nThat was frustrating and \"a bit embarrassing\" for Graham Edgell, a Los Angeles printing broker who loves Apple products and was eager to show off his new watch to friends after his wife bought it for him. Edgell, 38, said he thought a software glitch was interfering with the watch's message notifications and other features, until he heard about others having trouble with their tattoos.\n\nEdgell solved his problem by moving the watch further down on his wrist, away from the dark floral tattoo that stops just above the cuff of his shirt sleeve. \"When it was on the tattoo, it was as if it had lost connection with my skin,\" he said. \"Now it's absolutely fine.\"\n\nThe watch tracks heart rates through a common medical technique that measures how much light is absorbed by blood. An Apple representative referred a reporter to the company's website, which explains \"Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light-sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist -- and the green light absorption -- is greater.\"\n\nWhile the problem doesn't occur with all tattoos, it may be more likely to affect people with dark red or black ink on the side of the wrist where they wear their watch, according to anecdotal accounts.\n\n\"So far it's not been an issue,\" said Nick Borelli, a 34-year-old marketing executive in Cleveland. He has a black tattoo on the inside of his wrist -- but not the side where he has worn the Apple Watch. He added that he likes the watch but worries the glitch could affect a large \"target demographic\" of young, tech-savvy people with tattoos, who are likely to be interested in the watch as a gadget and fashion accessory.\n\nThe same problem may affect other fitness bands that use that method. At least one tattooed owner of a Fitbit device posted a similar complaint on the Reddit online forum in January. A Fitbit representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIf tattoos can interfere with the way light is absorbed through the skin, there so far doesn't appear to be a problem with dark skin or scars. Some experts say natural skin pigmentation wouldn't block the green light used by Apple, although researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have found dark skin can affect the results of blood oxygen sensors that use infrared light.\n\nThe tech industry has confronted problems with skin coloring in the past. Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard both fielded complaints several years ago about facial recognition sensors in gaming consoles and computers that struggled to detect people with dark skin. Both companies suggested poor lighting interfered with the sensors' ability to measure the contrast between eyes and other facial features.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market bounced back on Friday as investors picked up companies that had dropped earlier in the week. Major indexes recovered nearly all their losses from a fall the day before.\n\n\"It's an odd day in the markets,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. The news out Friday was mostly disappointing, he said. Big corporations' earnings reports weren't all that good.\n\nExpedia was an exception. The online travel company turned in sales that topped Wall Street's estimates, driving its stock up $7.46, or 8 percent, to $101.69.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 22.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 2,108.29. That's after dropping 1 percent the day before.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 183.54 points, or 1 percent, to 18,024.06, while the Nasdaq composite rose 63.97 points, 1.3 percent, to 5,005.39.\n\nCharlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, cautioned against reading too much into a day with light trading. \"The rally is fun,\" he said, \"but it doesn't mean much.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq lost 1.7 percent for the week as investors sold many of the technology companies that have fared well this year. Strong gains for Apple and other tech stocks helped the Nasdaq finally topple a record high last Thursday. So, what changed?\n\nSmith said Apple's earnings had something to do with it. Apple is big enough that its moves can swing the Nasdaq higher or lower. Last week, investors bought Apple's stock in anticipation of another blowout earnings report when the tech giant reported results Monday. In the three days afterward, Apple's stock lost 6 percent.\n\nLinkedIn plunged after the online networking service warned of weaker earnings in the months ahead, a result of the stronger dollar and the company's pending purchase of Lynda.com, an online learning company. Twitter continued a slump started earlier in the week when the company turned in disappointing sales and cut its revenue outlook. Twitter dropped $1.12, or 3 percent, to $37.84, while LinkedIn lost $46.92, or 19 percent, to $205.21.\n\nRoughly a third of all the companies in the S&P 500 reported first-quarter results this week, and the news was mixed. Falling oil prices and a rising dollar hammered many of them. Analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 will say overall earnings inched up 0.6 percent compared with the same period of last year, according to S&P Capital IQ, a provider of financial information. But revenue is expected to drop 1.4 percent.\n\nAblin said that investors are wrestling with a slew of diverging trends. Recent reports have raised concerns about the economy's strength. On Wednesday, the government said that it nearly stopped growing in the first three months of the year. To some investors that's not such bad news: Weak economic growth could lead the Federal Reserve to postpone its plans to raise a key borrowing rate. Record low interest rates have helped the stock market soar since the financial crisis.\n\n\"Economic data has recently been disappointing,\" Ablin said, \"but that keeps the Fed offstage.\"\n\nIn Europe, the only major market open for trading was in Britain, where the FTSE 100 finished with a gain of 0.4 percent.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4 percent. New Zealand's benchmark rose 0.1 percent. Most markets in Asia and Europe were closed for the International Workers Day holiday.\n\nBack in the U.S., government bond prices sank, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.12 percent from 2.03 percent the day before.\n\nIn commodities trading, gold dropped $7.90 to end at $1,174.50 an ounce, while silver lost 2 cents to $16.14 an ounce. Copper added 4 cents to $2.93 a pound.", "Security researchers have developed an automated system for detecting Android apps that secretly connect to ad sites and user tracking sites.\n\nThere are essentially two starkly different environments in which to download apps. The first is Apple's app store, which carefully vets apps before allowing only those deemed fit to appear. The second is the Google Play store, which is more open because Google exercises a lighter touch in vetting apps, only excluding those that are obviously malicious.\n\nBut because Google Play is more open, the apps it offers span a much wider quality range. Many connect to ad-related sites and tracking sites while some connect to much more dubious sites that are associated with malware.\n\nBut here's the problem -- this activity often takes place without the owner being aware of what is going on. That's something that most smartphone users would be appalled to discover -- if only they were able to.\n\nToday, Luigi Vigneri and pals from Eurecom in France have a solution. These guys have come up with an automated way to check the apps in Google Play and monitor the sites they connect to. And their results reveal the extraordinary scale of secret connections that many apps make without their owners being any the wiser.\n\nVigneri and co began by downloading over 2,000 free apps from all 25 categories on the Google Play store. They then launched each app on a Samsung Galaxy SIII running Android version 4.1.2 that was set up to channel all traffic through the team's server. This recorded all the urls that each app attempted to contact.\n\nNext they compared the urls against a list of known ad-related sites from a database called EasyList and a database of user tracking sites called EasyPrivacy, both compiled for the open source AdBlock Plus project. Finally, they counted the number of matches on each list for every app\n\nThe results make for interesting reading. In total, the apps connect to a mind-boggling 250,000 different urls across almost 2,000 top level domains. And while most attempt to connect to just a handful of ad and tracking sites, some are much more prolific.\n\nVigneri and co give as an example \"Music Volume Eq,\" an app designed to control volume, a task that does not require a connection to any external urls. And yet the app makes many connections. \"We find the app Music Volume EQ connects to almost 2,000 distinct URLs,\" they say.\n\nAnd it is not alone in its excesses. The team say about 10 percent of the apps they tested connect to more than 500 different urls. And nine out of 10 of the most frequently contact ad-related domains are run by Google.\n\nThe user tracking sites that apps connect to are less pervasive. More than 70 percent of apps do not connect to any user tracking sites. But those that do can be extravagant, some connecting to more than 800 user tracking sites. What's more many of these are created by organizations that Google has designated with \"top developer status.\" The worst offender is an app called Eurosport Player which connects to 810 different user tracking sites.\n\nA small proportion of the apps even seem designed to connect to suspicious sites connected with malware.\n\nMost users of these apps will have little, if any, knowledge of this kind of behavior. So Vigneri and co have developed their own app that monitors the behavior of others on a user's smartphone and reveals exactly which external sites these apps are attempting to connect to.\n\nThey call their new app NoSuchApp or NSA for short \"in honor of a similarly acronymed monitoring agency.\"\n\nThat should give Android users confidence in the apps they use. \"With this application, our goal is to provide a mechanism for end users to be aware of the network activity of their installed Android applications,\" say Vigneri and co.\n\nThe team plan to make the app publicly available on Google Play in the near future.", "Marilyn Monroe once said that becoming a blonde changed her life and made her a star.

Chemicals in every profession have their challenges.\u00c2 When you are going from dark to lighter, there is a chemical process that must happen to change the color. As the process occurs, the darker hair is lightened first to a reddish orange, then to an orange gold, then a golden yellow, and finally the desired\u00c2 \"level\" of blonde is reached but not always the desired \"tone\". Often the color has to be toned to achieve the beautiful end result.\u00c2 We are in an instant gratification society. Ladies come in to the salon with black or brown hair and expect to leave the salon the same day with perfectly platinum or buttery blonde. Often it works like that but in many cases it takes a few processes to achieve perfection. Allow the process.\u00c2 Be aware of this. Never go in for a complete color change the day of an important event. Allow a few days for any adjustments that may be needed. Color means chemicals.\u00c2 Communicate with your stylist on what you are looking for. Bring pictures.

So is President Barack Obama. His solution is to give him the authority to fast-track international trade deals by limiting the ability of Congress to participate in them.\n\nBacked by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and other trade organizations, Obama is pushing the Bay Area's congressional delegation to get on board so he can accelerate deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which could enormously help the tech community.\n\nBut many lawmakers, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, Mike Honda, Jackie Speier, Eric Swalwell, Mark DeSaulnier, Barbara Lee and Jerry McNerney, are either undecided or flat against it. Some, such as Lofgren and Eshoo, typically are on tech's side.\n\nWe're all for free trade, but we see their point.\n\nThis legislation calls for trade negotiations to be done essentially in secret. Corporate executives and lobbyists would have opportunities to shape the language, but the public would not. Members of Congress and staff members with security clearances would be able to read the documents along the way but not take notes or make anything public, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nAfter an agreement is reached there would be a 60-day period for public comment and another 105 days for Congressional review. But this would not be an opportunity to suggest changes to make the pact better. Sometimes a minor tweak of language means the world in winning support and confidence.\n\nAt the end of the review, Congress would have to take a yes-or-no vote on the deal.\n\nBy contrast, European nations working on a similar trade agreement are posting draft legislation online during negotiations.\n\nObama has talked a good game on transparency. During his first campaign, he said: \"The current Fast Track process does not mandate the agreements include binding labor and environmental protections nor does it give an adequate role to Congress in the selection and design of agreements. I would will work with Congressional leaders to ensure that any new TPA authority fix these basic failings and open up the process to the American people for their participation and scrutiny.\"\n\nTrade agreements can create binding policy at all levels of government on labor, financial and environmental issues. Some already fear that Hollywood will use the Trans-Pacific Partnership revive the Stop Online Piracy Act, horrific legislation to hold Web companies responsible for policing the Internet. Hollywood wants to use trade agreements to control piracy, but using a treaty to enact policy broadly opposed by the public would be wrong.\n\nTrust is in short supply in Washington on both sides of the aisle. This is not the time to hunker down on secrecy. Let people see what's in the works and maybe catch fixable problems before they blow up in a yes-or-no showdown.", "Last week in Washington, we witnessed the fruits of bipartisan labor. Republican and Democratic members of two congressional committees approved legislation that could have a major positive impact on California's economy and on our national trade agenda.\n\nTrade has always been critical to California's economy. In 2013, California exported $168 billion in goods and services. That is why this bipartisan legislation needs the support of California's congressional delegation when it is considered by the full House and Senate next month.\n\nThe Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., includes requirements to protect the free flow of data and prohibits countries from trying to lock data and information inside their borders. Passing TPA gives California's congressional delegation -- which represents companies such as Apple, Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce.com, and Symantec -- the opportunity to help shape the agreements that will drive the economy for years to come.\n\nIn years past, trade meant exporting iconic California products such as almonds, oranges and wine. But a new type of trade is emerging as companies across all sectors of our economy move data around the globe to create and deliver innovative goods and services. For example, the American Red Cross uses Salesforce.com's technology to connect with volunteers and partners during disasters. This requires data from various locations around the world to be fed into a digital operations center, which the American Red Cross uses to monitor and respond to real-time needs.\n\nThe freedom to move and share data across borders is critical to how companies across industries -- like health care, energy, manufacturing and more -- respond to customers and develop exciting new technologies. As global trade is increasingly driven by digital innovation, and the jobs linked to trade are increasingly high technology jobs, making sure that other nations do not create barriers to trade that undermine this has become even more important.\n\nUnfortunately, more and more countries are enacting anti-competitive trade policies that restrict the movement of important data across borders, forcing companies to relocate operations within their borders. These policies are designed to help domestic companies grow at the expense of U.S. companies, and they pose a severe threat to the health and competitiveness of American businesses and innovators. Moreover, passing TPA gives the United States a stronger negotiating position with foreign governments so our trade negotiators come home with the best possible outcome.\n\nThe future of the global economy has tremendous promise. The world will create 4.4 million information technology jobs over the next four years to support data innovation. To ensure California captures this promise, we need modern trade agreements that support today's economy.\n\nThe first step to achieving that is passing TPA legislation that promotes a 21st century economy. Passing TPA gives Congress the power to make sure trade agreements promote and protect jobs in California and deserves the support of the state's congressional delegation.\n\nVictoria Espinel is president and CEO of the software industry trade group BSA (The Software Alliance). She wrote this article for this newspaper.", "NEW YORK - Apple confirmed Friday that tattoos can in fact prevent the Apple Watch from working properly.\n\nSpecifically, the company said in an update on its support site that certain tattoos can interfere with the heart rate sensor on its smartwatches.\n\n\"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance,\" Apple says. \"The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\"\n\nApple listed other factors that can affect the sensor's performance, including skin perfusion, or how much blood flows through skin.\n\n\"If you're exercising in the cold, for example, the skin perfusion in your wrist may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading,\" according to Apple.\n\nSome irregular movements, such as tennis or boxing, can also interfere with the heart rate monitor. \"Rhythmic movements, such as running or cycling, give better results.\"\n\nSome Apple Watch owners took to Reddit and Twitter to complain about the tattoo issue earlier this week.\n\nThe problem stems from the way the Apple Watch senses your heartbeat. According to Apple, the back of the watch rapidly flashes green and infrared light at your skin, which gets absorbed or reflected by your blood. When your heart beats, there is more blood in your wrist, while there is less blood between beats. By sensing the timing between your heartbeats, the Apple Watch can calculate your heart rate.\n\nAs it turns out, solid-colored tattoos -- particularly red ones -- also absorb the green light and reflect red light. Black tattoos, which absorb both green and red light, can also screw up the Apple Watch's heart rate sensor.\n\nThe Apple Watch works fine with dark-colored skin, scars and skin abrasions, which are translucent, allowing light to pass through. Tattoo ink is opaque, so that light can't penetrate your skin.\n\n\"If you're not able to get a consistent reading because of any of these factors, you can connect your Apple Watch wirelessly to external heart rate monitors such as Bluetooth chest straps,\" Apple advises.", "In the future, your car will anticipate your every need, from where you're heading to what you'd like to listen to along the way -- and, of course, drive itself.\n\nThat's the vision automakers are test-driving in Silicon Valley, which has emerged as ground zero in the race to re-imagine the automobile. Car companies ranging from General Motors to Mercedes have set up shop in the nation's hotbed of technology and innovation for a dose of inspiration -- and a little wheeling and dealing -- as they hash out how their vehicles will connect to the Internet, interact with users and drive autonomously.\n\nAnd with Apple and Google increasingly eyeing the road, they're shifting their efforts into overdrive.\n\nCars have remained comparatively low-tech as everything from phones to thermostats have undergone digital makeovers. But automakers can no longer deny that connected cars are the way of the future -- and they're pursuing the talent they need to engineer the shift, said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, a consulting firm in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBy focusing on Silicon Valley, automakers are \"almost unanimously admitting they don't have the internal resources to address the issue,\" he said. \"Those who do have the knowledge, insight and skills to address the issue are all in one village.\"\n\nCapped off by Ford's expansion earlier this year, most major automakers now have a presence in Silicon Valley. And even the early entrants have redoubled their efforts in recent years, transforming their Silicon Valley offices from far-flung research outposts to core arms of the company, said Chris Gerdes, who directs the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University. He credits Google -- whose cars routinely whir around sans drivers -- with giving the traditional automakers a sense of urgency.\n\n\"Companies are realizing that to get the most out of their Silicon Valley offices, they need more than just a few people,\" Gerdes said. \"They need to have an office that is doing exciting work and can compete for the very best talent the valley has to offer.\"\n\nThe pace of innovation is so brisk that some car companies project their vehicles will be running autonomously in at least some situations within the next five years. But when it comes to autonomous driving, honing the technology is just the beginning -- the real test will be how drivers react, said Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan Research Center Silicon Valley.\n\nAt Nissan's Sunnyvale, Calif., office, engineers are working on software for autonomous driving alongside a team of in-house anthropologists and sociologists whose mission is to ensure humans remain at the center of the design so they feel comfortable relinquishing the wheel, whether weaving through traffic in San Francisco or cruising through a neighborhood in Berkeley, Sierhuis said. Working with university partners, Nissan recently launched an ambitious research project to study how cultural norms for driving vary from place to place.\n\n\"You can't just rip out the steering wheel without understanding what that means,\" Sierhuis said.\n\nOutside the confines of their labs, automakers are capitalizing on their offices in the valley to form relationships with the tech industry's key players. BMW has a long track record of working with Apple and will have an app on the new Apple Watch, noted Uwe Higgen, who directs the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nHonda collaborates with tech companies large and small and recently opened a studio for developers in Mountain View. The release of Android Auto -- Google's platform for apps in cars -- and Apple's rival CarPlay has done much to spur developers' work on cars, said Nick Sugimoto, a senior program director at the Honda Silicon Valley Lab.\n\n\"Customers are really eager to get this in their cars,\" he said.\n\nAuto executives stationed in the Bay Area also act as their companies' eyes and ears in the valley, ensuring that they do not fall behind either the technological curve or the whims of modern drivers.\n\nAnd some automakers are even willing to look beyond the car. Ford is collecting data from cyclists to better understand bike usage, said Jim Buczkowski, Ford's director of Electrical and Electronics Systems for Research and Advanced Engineering. It helps the company prepare for a future in which city dwellers will seamlessly shift between various modes of transportation, perhaps driving their car to a train station, hopping aboard, and then mounting their bikes for the last leg of the journey, he said.\n\n\"We know that our cars and trucks are going to have to work very effectively with other forms of transportation to avoid congestion,\" he said.", "Apple Inc limited availability of the Apple Watch after a key component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe component, called the taptic engine, produces the sensation of being tapped on the wrist, the newspaper reported.\n\nApple declined to comment on the story.\n\nApple has not given any sales figures for its hotly anticipated Apple Watch since it began taking orders this month. Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday that demand continued to outstrip supply.", "Free Comic Book Day is always the first Saturday in May, which would make this Saturday Free Comic Book Day!

But could they have seller's remorse now that the averages closed in the green on Friday?\n\n\"Now, I don't think we're necessarily out of the selling woods, though, because we're in a real conundrum here,\" the \"Mad Money\" host added.\n\nInvestors are perplexed right now, thanks to the weakening dollar and rising price of crude. They had previously favored stocks of companies within the United States because they weren't hurt by a strong dollar. They also banked on companies that benefited from the low price of gasoline.\n\nBut then, when the dollar strengthened, these stocks lost their luster, and now investors are wary of the same stocks they loved just last month. And while they are no longer in love with domestic stocks, the international companies aren't doing so well right now.\n\nPut all of this together, and we have a treacherous marketplace. One where Cramer sees a major sea change happening. One where no stocks are in favor right now: domestic, international, everything! That's what caused a major selloff.\n\nOn Friday, investors were finally able to breathe because oil went down and the dollar went up. That stopped the selling, at least for one session. But could investors from April have seller's remorse in May?\n\nWith this in mind, Cramer shared his game plan of stocks and events that he will be watching for next week.\n\nMonday: Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Denny's\n\nBerkshire: Monday morning brings the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Lately, Cramer has seen the same old pattern again. Investors get gloomy and sell, and then they hear the Oracle of Omaha speak, and it brings their spirits back up.\n\nCramer expects Monday to be no different. In fact, he thinks Warren Buffett will be filled with optimism when he speaks.\n\n\"So expect Buffett to work some magic when we come in Monday,\" he said.\n\nDenny's: With the price of oil on the rise, investors have turned against the biggest beneficiaries, the retail and restaurant groups. Will this craziness ever end? Cramer thinks Denny's will have some great things to say, and the stock will go higher on Tuesday.\n\nTuesday: Estee Lauder, Disney\n\nEstee Lauder: Cramer is looking for a big number from it, but doesn't expect a pop in the stock when it reports.\n\nDisney: Cramer is worried that this has run too much ahead of the quarter. Thus he recommended investors just hope that both Disney and Estee Lauder come down on Monday so they can buy it on weakness. Otherwise you have to wait.\n\nWednesday: Battleground day -- Tesla, Whole Foods\n\nTesla: Frankly, Cramer's not expecting much from Tesla. He absolutely hated its last quarter and thinks the stock has run lately because it has had a high-profile announcement. He expects the stock to run up ahead of the quarter, and then sell off.\n\nWhole Foods: The stock has acted terribly lately, which tends to foreshadow weak numbers. However, Cramer thinks this one has been punished quite a bit. He recommended buying half ahead of the quarter and then half later if the stock sells off.\n\nThursday: Alibaba, Tableau Data\n\nAlibaba: Forget it -- Cramer does not want to own it. If you want to own it, he advised you to buy Yahoo, which has a huge stake in the company.\n\nTableau Data: This is the single most expensive stock that Cramer follows, because it has such great growth. If Tableau goes up after it reports, Cramer thinks it is a good idea to get in on stocks like Workday and Splunk, which could have pin action associated with Tableau.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer\n\nCramer Remix: Take this action on Apple now\n\nCramer: Buy oil stocks? Forget it\n\nCramer: Stocks are cursed -- Apple's fault\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriday: Nonfarm employment report\n\nThe Labor Department's nonfarm employment report is the single most important macro number that anyone could imagine. Investors are saying that if we have strong job numbers, the Fed will likely tighten soon.\n\n\"But I think we're in a real rock-hard-place situation here, because if employment is robust, then we'll sell off in anticipation of a Fed rate hike,\" Cramer said.\n\nWhat if the number is weak? That will mean there is a sell off ahead, out of fear that the economy is slowing. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nUltimately, Cramer suspects that investors who sold in April will have seller's remorse in May. That will only get worse when Warren Buffett works his magic on Monday and tells everyone to buy. But after that, it will go right back to business as usual, and Cramer will be taking his cue from stocks that move after earnings.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nAssociated Press writer Olga R. Rodriguez reported from San Francisco contributed to this story.", "Dashboard cameras, which continuously record driving video, are nothing new, but Thinkware puts a new twist on the technology with its Dash Cam X500, using the camera to add driver assistance features and its GPS to warn of speed or red-light cameras.\n\nThe Thinkware Dash Cam X500 goes for $279 in the US and \u00a3199 in the UK, where speed zones and cameras would make it more useful. Australian pricing was not available, but the company does have an Australian distributor.\n\nThe Dash Cam X500 attaches to the windshield, near the rearview mirror, and automatically begins recording whenever you start the car. An accelerometer senses impact, causing the X500 to save video of a collision, which can later be used as evidence in legal proceedings.\n\nAt 4.1 inches long and 2 inches high, and with its camera lens, the X500 resembles a pocket-size digital camera. Lending to that resemblance is the LCD dominating the back of the device. Four buttons are stacked next to the LCD, and the top of the X500 features a power port and two connector ports designed for the X500's accessories. The X500 saves its video to a microSD card in the side of the device and its own internal storage.\n\nA plastic attachment point on top of the X500 lets you slide it onto the included mounting bracket.\n\nAlthough the X500 lacks a touchscreen, I found it easy to navigate its onscreen menus using the four buttons on its back. The two center buttons scroll through feature lists, while the top and bottom buttons let me go back or select features.\n\nIn addition, Thinkware includes file viewer software that works on Windows or Apple OS. This viewer shows video windows for front and rear video, along with a map window showing the car's location during recording, vehicle speed and even pitch, yaw, and roll angles.\n\nAlthough most of the viewer software looks fine, the file chooser is very rough. A window shows all the video files created by the X500, separated into categories for Continuous, Motion, Event and Manual. The problem here is that, even for a short drive, the X500 creates a lot of video files. The file names include the date and time in a string, which can be difficult to visually parse. It would be better if the viewer software parsed the file information for time and location, then gave users a better interface for finding relevant video clips.\n\nTo test the X500, I installed it in a 2015 Toyota Camry. The plastic mounting bracket includes an adhesive pad that sticks to the inside of the windshield. Make sure to get that bracket precisely where you want it, as the adhesive pad is very difficult to remove. Putting it just in front of the rearview mirror kept it from blocking my view of the road, but I had to run its power cable over the sun visor, down the side of the car, then back over to the console to reach the 12-volt power point.\n\nThe included power cable is long enough to run through a car, but it would be more convenient if Thinkware used a USB plug rather than the cable's fixed 12-volt adapter, which monopolizes an entire power point in a car.\n\nAs soon as I turned on the car, the X500 turned on, and its female voice prompt told me continuous recording had begun. In later testing I found that it won't run without the microSD card inserted in its slot. Thinkware includes a 16MB card with a full-size SD card adapter in the package.\n\nI headed out onto he street, the X500 working unobtrusively in the background, until its forward camera thought I was about to hit someone or I approached an intersection with a red-light camera. While I drove, the X500 periodically beeped at me, leaving me to interpret what that beep might mean. I had its forward collision alert and lane departure warning enabled, and it would also beep when it recorded an impact event. Although I never actually collided with another car, the X500 saved almost 20 Event videos over about a 40-minute drive.", "When publicly held companies have excess cash, they often face two main choices: issue dividends, or buy back shares from the marketplace.\n\nBoth actions are considered roughly equal in terms of benefit to stockholders. On this week's Money Matters, financial commentator Greg Heberlein explains why he prefers dividends.\n\nWhenever profitable companies wind up with large hoards of cash that aren't needed for product development or mergers and acquisitions, they come under a lot of pressure to share the wealth with stockholders.\n\nTwo prime examples would be Apple's $137 billion cash on hand, and Microsoft's more than $60 billion cash reserve.\n\nDividends\n\nDividends pay cash directly to shareholders. For most stocks, dividends are paid quarterly. Inherently, the returns exceed what one would receive in a savings account. That's because stocks carry higher risks.\n\nDividends vary widely. The average dividend paid today on stocks in the Standard and Poor's 500 index is just over 2 percent.\n\nIn 1932, during the Great Depression, dividend yield set a record at 13.6 percent. In 2000, when the dot-com explosion shot markets to the stratosphere, the yield bottomed at 1.11 percent.\n\nIn a share buyback, a company repurchases its own shares, removing them from the marketplace. As a result, an individual shareholder's stake as a percentage of the whole company has grown. This tends to boost the stock price.\n\nSo, instead of receiving a cash dividend, the shareholder has the option of selling the stock at a higher price.\n\nBut there's a hitch with buybacks.\n\nCorporate executives are a lot like individual shareholders. Everyone knows the way to win in the stock market is to buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, studies show that many of us actually buy high and sell low.\n\nThe pressure to buy stocks is greater as the price rises, or peaks, than it is when the stock price is in a valley.\n\nSo if a company repurchases shares at the peak, the company loses money as the price falls, just as the shareholder would by buying at the top.\n\nIn the long run, one would expect both company and individual to do well, because most substantial companies see their stock prices rise over extended periods. But that's little consolation to the individual who may wish or need to sell before that happens.\n\nIn a contest between dividends and share buybacks, the dividend wins.\n\nAlso note that when a company announces a buyback, the stock usually rises. However, that buyback can be illusory - it might take years to complete, or never be completed at all.\n\nCorporate executives are not bound by such pronouncements. But a cash dividend is money in the bank.", "NEW YORK -- Technology stocks are trading at levels not seen since Y2K and that may trigger some bad memories. After all, the last time the index reached a record high it quickly plummeted in what became known as at the dot-com crash.\n\nBut this time the Nasdaq composite index is very different from what it was in 2000, financial advisers say. The bull market that began after the recession may eventually lose steam, but advisers say there's no need for investors to panic or change up their 401(k)s or other retirement accounts.\n\nThe Nasdaq is just a number, says Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. As long as investors have a diverse mix of U.S. and international stocks and bonds in their accounts, Ritter says, there is no need to worry.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite is not dependent on the technology sector like it was in 2000. \"It's diversified,\" says Hugh Anderson, partner and managing Director at HighTower Advisors in Las Vegas.\n\nTech companies still make up a big part of the Nasdaq composite. About 40 percent of the more than 2,500 stocks in the index are tech stocks. That's considerably less than what it was in 2000, when about 65 percent of the index was made up of tech stocks. A more balanced index, which is also led by health care, cuts against another steep drop if the technology sector falls into a slump.\n\nFifteen years ago, many technology companies were unproven startups such as Pets.com or Kozmo.com, and they eventually flopped. Today's tech companies are a big part of everyday life, such as Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., says Beth Lynch, an investment adviser at Schneider Downs Wealth Management in Pittsburgh. These companies are powering the search engines, and making smartphones we use to regularly buy goods online.\n\nSome companies that were on the index in 2000 have grown since. Apple, for example, didn't release the first iPhone until 2007. Today, Apple is the world's largest company with a market capitalization of $760 billion. \"Today you have more stable companies,\" says Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Bank in Philadelphia. Apple and Microsoft Corp., for example, hold billions of dollars in cash.\n\nAnd investors are backing actual results, rather than largely speculating about the potential growth of a startup. Corporate earnings, actual and projected, are what is driving stock prices higher, says Benjamin Beck, managing partner of Beck Bode Wealth Management in Boston. He says investors should focus on what companies expect to earn in the 12 months, not on their share prices or the level of an index.\n\n\"If you're focused on an all-time high,\" says Beck, \"you're on the wrong road.\"\n\nStill, if you're nervous, you can check how much of your retirement account is exposed to technology stocks. Three of the most widely held stock funds in 401(k)s are the Vanguard Institutional Index, the Fidelity Contrafund and the Fidelity Spartan 500 Index, according to 401(k) rating company BrightScope. Although technology represents the largest percentage of each fund's portfolio, its weighting is only slightly bigger than the next largest sector.\n\nYou can check how much exposure you have by looking through the funds in your retirement accounts and plugging the ticker symbols into the \"Instant X-Ray\" on Morningstar.com. The portfolio tool will give you a breakdown of what sectors and types of stocks a fund invests in.\n\nIn the short term, the Nasdaq is likely to fall slightly as investors sell stocks to cash in on recent gains. \"It's part of the normal process,\" says Lynch from Schneider Downs Wealth Management.", "The company expects all products areas except mobile to make an operating profit during its fiscal 2016\n\nSony's CEO Kazuo Hirai has some difficult decisions to make as consumers continue to shun the company's smartphones, resulting in continued losses.\n\nThe company on Thursday reported a net loss of \u00a5126 billion (US$1.1 billion) for its latest fiscal year, which ended on March 31. Year-on-year, Sony's revenue increased by 5.8 percent to \u00a58.2 trillion.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sony's Mobile Communications unit, which develops the Xperia smartphones, gets part of the blame for another year in the red.\n\nThe future of the mobile division has been very much up in question since a new head of Sony Mobile Communications was appointed in October last year. Sony has announced layoffs and pulled the plug on the PlayStation Mobile platform, but hasn't been able to turn around its fortunes.\n\nDuring Sony's fourth quarter, running from January to March, revenue was flat, but the number of phones it sold dropped.\n\nFaced with Apple and Samsung's domination of the high end and competition from new and old Chinese vendors at the low end, Sony and other companies such as HTC are struggling to get people to buy their phones. Sony was the tenth largest phone maker in 2014 with a 2 percent market share, according to Gartner.\n\nWhile Sony expects all other segments to make an operating profit during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, Mobile Communications will still record a loss, the company said. If Sony wants to turn around its smartphone fortunes, it needs to break the mold a bit more, and give away more of its content, including movies, Nick Spencer, senior practice director at ABI Research, said in a recent interview.\n\nBut it seems the company has already planned for a different future. In February, Sony announced its latest turnaround plan that will see increased spending on the games and network services division, hoping to attract more gamers to the PlayStation and its PlayStation Network.\n\nAlong with music and movies, the company is also betting on the unit that makes image sensors for smartphones. The sensors will get more funding, to be spent on research and increased production.\n\nThe company's goal is \u00a5500 billion in operating profit for its fiscal year to March 31, 2018. In the short term, the goal is to turn around to a \u00a5140 billion profit in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 from a net loss of \u00a5126 billion in the previous year.\n\nSend news tips and comments to mikael_ricknas@idg.com\n\n2015 State of The IT Channel Survey : IT'S TIME!!!

Samsung has been notoriously involved in such \"success\" stories but we've been hearing of similar reports related to phones launched by LG or Apple.\n\nToday brings us gloomy news related to one of Google's phone, the Nexus 6 to be precise. We know that the Nexus 6 isn't one of the phones to boast the longest battery life, but the story we're about to share with you isn't related to the device's life cycle.\n\nApparently, the phone also has some technical issues with the battery. We've been hearing stories that the power house inside the Nexus 6 has been found to swell, causing the rear cover to pop open.\n\nNexus 6 battery explodes for no apparent good reason\n\nBut in the case of this particular user from Twitter the battery of her Nexus 6 actually ended up exploding. Thankfully, no fire ensued. The whole affair happened while the phone was lying unused. It wasn't charging either.\n\nNot that charging overnight should have had destructive side-effects such as this. The affected user took the opportunity to post a bunch of photographs of the affected Nexus 6 on Twitter for the whole world to see.\n\nSince the Nexus 6 isn't a terribly popular phone, you probably haven't heard about these battery issues. Regardless, it seems some items are affected by real problems and hopefully Motorola will find a way to deal with them.\n\nIt's unknown whether the Nexus 6 owner contacted the manufacturing company to complain about the damage, but in all likelihood she did.\n\nIn related news, the Nexus 6 is the only phone Google is waiting to promote its wireless carrier plans in the US, which launched under the banner of Project Fi.\n\nGoogle is offering the chance to user to pick up the handset through Project Fi with a 24-month installment plan ($27 / \u20ac25 per month for the 32GB model and $29 / \u20ac27 for the 64GB model). Naturally one can purchase the device contract-free, if you deem this the better option.\n\nGoogle also offers unlimited domestic talk and text plus unlimited international texts and low fees for cellular data in the US and abroad.\n\n@jasuja whoa! As in, exploded? -- Rohin Dharmakumar (@r0h1n) May 1, 2015", "LOS ANGELES (AP) - After demonstrating the merits of a Japanese-made bullet train to California's governor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is heading to a session with Japanese-Americans to promote expanded trade between his country and the U.S.\n\nAt the halfway point of his three-day visit to California, the Asian leader will attend a Japan-U.S. Economic Forum on Friday in Los Angeles at which he is expected to announce policies to facilitate American investment in Japan, said Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.\n\nThe prime minister, who studied at the University of Southern California's School of Policy, Planning, and Development, will also meet and show support to Japanese students attending U.S. universities, Ito said.\n\nHe is scheduled to attend a reception Friday night, with former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and actor George Takei among the guests.\n\nOutside the economic forum in downtown Los Angeles, about a hundred people chanted and held signs demanding justice for the sexual slaves kept by the Japanese during World War. The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high-speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

One tech company's most baffling bauble, or the herald of a new era in wrist-mounted personal computers?\n\nOne thing's for certain: there's no shortage of opinions about the Apple Watch.\n\nApple's big bet on wearable technology is now out in the wild, and lots has already been said about it. About how it connects you to important things going on in your digital life, with buzzwords such as Glances and Digital Crown and Force Touch, which sounds vaguely like a Darth Vader sex move.\n\nIn order to get a figurative and literal grip on Apple's latest device, I bought two Apple Watches to put through their paces: a 42 mm grey aluminum model with a plastic sport strap ($519) and a stainless steel 38 mm model with a classic leather strap ($849). Note to my bosses: one or both of these are going on eBay by the end of the week. I don't get paid enough to keep them.\n\nI'm not going to describe all of the Apple Watch's core features, or tell you how you swipe, tap and poke it. For that, check out the guided tour videos below on apple.ca/watch. Perhaps with the volume down, as their voiceovers are uniquely grating.\n\nI'm here to tell you what's good about Apple's foray into wearable tech, and what's not. What they've done right, and what they haven't. And to offer 10 things I like about the Apple Watch, and 10 things I really don't.\n\nNobody does industrial design quite like Apple, and the Apple Watch is no exception. Both the aluminum and stainless steel models are lovely to look at, and the tiny screen is dazzling. Most smartwatches are bulky beasts, but even the 42 mm Apple Watch is surprisingly light and comfortable. It won't rival a Rolex or Breitling for style, but it also doesn't scream, \"Hey, look at me! I'm wearing a giant freakin' computer on my wrist!\"\n\nIt's great at poking you\n\nAside from telling the time - with customizable watch faces ranging from animated jellyfish to Mickey Mouse - the Apple Watch's most useful feature is giving your wrist a gentle vibration when it needs to tell you something, and displaying the information on its screen. Whether it's an iMessage, a calendar reminder, a Stanley Cup playoff score or any of the other thousands of potential notifications, the Apple Watch wants to feed you bite-sized pieces of data at the appropriate moment. And it does that pretty well.\n\nYou can make phone calls on your wrist\n\nWant to feel like George Jetson? Try making or receiving phone calls on your watch. The sound quality from the Apple Watch speaker is a bit tinny (although my friends say my voice sounds fine on their end), but the mere fact you're holding a conversation by talking into your wrist feels very sci-fi. Very Dick Tracy. Very Secret Service. Or maybe just very silly.\n\nDigital Touch is dumb but amazing\n\nOne of the goofiest features of the Apple Watch is its so-called Digital Touch, which allows you to send special types of messages to other Apple Watch owners - taps, fingertip doodles and even your heartbeat. It sounds dopey, and it is, but it's also a lot of fun. The first thing I did with my watch was to send a penis doodle to my friend, and if that's not a glorious use of technology, I don't know what is. Taps are a fun way to annoy your watch-owning pals, and sending your heartbeat to a special someone could be an intimate way of telling them you're thinking about them. The faster your heartbeat, the more vigorously you're... thinking about them.\n\nIt makes fitness (sort of) fun\n\nThe Apple Watch has a built-in activity monitor and workout app, and several companies, including Nike and Strava, have launched fitness apps for the watch. It's oddly motivating to get little digital trophies for hitting your weekly activity goals, or to get helpful reminders from the Lifesum app to drink some water before dinner so you don't eat as much. Advice which you then promptly ignore, and order the full-size chorizo nachos. Not for sharing.\n\nThe heart-rate monitor really works\n\nI expected the Apple Watch's built-in heart rate monitor to be flaky, as many wrist-worn monitors are, but I did a side-by-side comparison with a chest-strap heart monitor and the results were surprising. During a 30-minute cardio workout, the Apple Watch was never off by more than five beats per minute from the chest-strap monitor, and was usually within two or three. It's not accurate enough for professional athletes (and the watch tracks changes in heart rate more slowly than a dedicated heart monitor), but it's not too shabby.\n\nIt listens to you\n\nBy raising your wrist and saying \"Hey Siri\" or holding the Digital Crown button down for a second, you can activate the Apple Watch's version of the iPhone's voice-driven assistant, Siri. Since typing on the watch's wee screen just isn't feasible, this is the way to do everything from asking for driving directions (\"Hey Siri, take me home\") to texting someone (\"Hey Siri, send a message to James saying please buy an Apple Watch so I can send you offensive doodles.\") The downside is that when dictating a message, there's no way to edit Siri's transcription before sending it. If you mess up, you need to start again from scratch, or just send the message as a voice note.\n\nYou can control your iPhone camera with it\n\nThis isn't a new feature on smartwatches, but it's especially well-implemented on the Apple Watch. Tap the camera icon and the screen will show a live feed from your iPhone camera, allowing you to take photos or activate a three-second countdown timer. You can't switch to the iPhone's front-facing camera or use any other camera modes - including video recording - but it's one of those little gimmicks that makes you go, \"Heh, neat.\"\n\nThe hand-off feature is (mostly) well done\n\nWhen an Apple Watch app runs up against something it can't do on its own, it will often prompt you to pull out your iPhone and continue using the full-fledged version of the app. While not all apps support this hand-off feature, it's seamless in those that do - just swipe up on the app icon in the lower left corner of your iPhone lock screen, and it will pick up at the spot you left off on the watch.\n\nSome apps work really well\n\nWant to know when the next bus is coming? Tap the Transit app and see all the routes nearest to you. Want to know if your flight is delayed? Tap the Air Canada, WestJet or other airline app for updates on flights that you've entered into your iPhone. Want to pay for that non-fat, extra-hot hazelnut latte? The watch's Passbook app stores scannable barcodes for many rewards cards, including Starbucks. (Apple Pay, the tap-and-go payment system being rolled out in the U.S., is rumoured to be coming to Canada this fall.) Yes, all this stuff can be done on your iPhone - the reality is almost anything that can be done on the Apple Watch can be done on your iPhone - but some tasks are especially well-suited to quick glances at your wrist.\n\nApple Watch apps can take anywhere from two to 10 seconds to launch, and some in particular - such as the Maps app - are especially slow to pull data over the Bluetooth connection that tethers the watch to your iPhone. The act of raising your wrist to turn on the watch's display (which is always off by default) can also take a second to register, which can be disconcerting until you get used to it. Maybe it's to be expected in a first-generation product, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\nThe app screen is a mess\n\nOnce you start downloading a few - or a few dozen - apps to your watch, you'll be faced with an ever-expanding galaxy of tiny circular icons floating on your Apple Watch home screen. While you can rearrange their placement, there's no way to group them, no way to delete or hide the default Apple apps and no way to know what icon belongs to what app without actually launching it, as they lack labels of any sort. Most of the app icons are fairly intuitive, but you'll inevitably reach a point where you have apps that you can't even identify. It's a fustercluck.\n\nThe Apple Watch's e-mail app will show you the contents of your inboxes and selected folders, let you read plain text messages and... that's about it. You can use Force Touch - a stronger push on the screen, sort of like a right click on a mouse - to delete, flag or mark e-mails as unread, but there's not even a rudimentary way to reply to e-mails. You can, however, use the hand-off feature to open an e-mail up on your iPhone and reply to it there.\n\nOther than music - you can use the Apple Watch to control playback on your iPhone, or store up to 2 GB of music on the watch itself to jam out to via Bluetooth headphones - the Apple Watch isn't designed for media consumption. It's surprisingly bad even for looking at photos, with a very minimal level of zoom, and there's no video playback option at all. Why would I want to look at photos or watch videos on such a tiny screen? Because I'm wearing a $500 computer on my wrist, and it would be cool. Is that too much to ask?\n\nThere aren't enough ways to customize notifications\n\nWhile you can freely choose which apps will tap your wrist and emit a little \"ding!\" when they have something to tell you, there's no way to assign different patterns of taps or alerts to different apps, and the watch won't mirror the custom sound and vibration patterns you've set on your iPhone. It would be really helpful to not have to look at the screen to know the difference between an incoming VIP e-mail and the watch prompting you to haul your butt out of your chair and stand up for a while.\n\nThe only sounds I've heard from my Apple Watch are alerts, alarms and the voice of the person I'm talking to on the phone. Most apps seem to have no audio at all, and even the GPS navigation on the Maps app only uses dings and vibrations to notify you of upcoming turns, rather than spoken directions. Which means glancing at your wrist to see which way you're supposed to turn, which means almost rear-ending a city bus and scaring the crap out of your passenger. Um, hypothetically. That didn't happen to me. Maybe.\n\nLots of apps haven't reached their potential yet\n\nAside from the App Store already being crowded with a hodgepodge of useless or redundant Apple Watch apps (including no fewer than two dozen dice-rolling apps), even some the slick, professional apps feel oddly hamstrung. For example, you can use the Amazon app to search for products by voice (and even order them right from your watch, if you're brave enough to have one-click ordering turned on), but the app only returns five search results, with no way to request more. There will inevitably be updates that address some of these shortcomings, but right now a lot of Apple Watch apps fall on the wrong side of the line between usefulness and novelty.\n\nThe battery lasts less than 24 hours\n\nApple says you should be able to get 18 hours of Apple Watch use on a single battery charge, and unless you're constantly fiddling with the thing, you'll likely get even more. But you're going to have to get into the habit of connecting it to its magnetic charging cable every night at bedtime (which negates the Apple Watch's potential usefulness as a sleep tracker, something I really like about the Pebble watch.) The watch does have a low-power reserve mode in which it does nothing more than tell the time, but then it ceases being an Apple Watch and becomes just a, you know, watch-watch.\n\nThere will be a better one out next year\n\nMany major tech companies refresh their popular products every 12 to 18 months, and given Apple's track record with this, there's no reason to expect the Apple Watch will be any different. If you buy one, know that you're buying a first-generation product that will be rendered obsolete in a year and a half at the outside. Apple Watch 2 or Apple Watch Air or Apple Watch Pro - whatever they decide to call it - will be Apple's thinnest, lightest, bestest, most awesomely magically personal watch ever when it comes out, and you'll be left holding something that feels a bit slow, fat and ugly.\n\nIt's too expensive\n\nThis is the biggest sticking point with the Apple Watch. The minimum entry point is $449 for the 38 mm aluminum sport watch, and tops out at $1,459 for the 42 mm black stainless steel watch with a link bracelet. (Or you can get an Apple Watch Edition model, starting at $13,000. But you're not going to do that, because you have at least a shred of common sense.) And the Apple Watch strap prices - running from $69 to $599 - feel like nothing short of robbery. Hopefully third-party straps will be on the market soon, because if you're willing to pay $599 for a watch strap, you are a fool. And as the saying goes, you and your money are soon parted.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nThe Apple Watch is a beautiful little toy. It doesn't do much that you can't do with your iPhone, but after only five days of wearing one, my wrist already feels a bit naked when I take it off. Wait, what? I have to look at my PHONE to see who's messaging me? What is this, the dark ages of 2010?\n\nThat said, the Apple Watch is not fully baked, not in its current form. Like the first-generation iPhone that launched in 2007, it needs time for its software to mature, and another generation or two for its hardware to become more robust. Wearable technology is the future, there's no denying that. But while the Apple Watch is probably the best and most beautiful smartwatch you can currently buy, these devices are still in their infancy.\n\nWill the Apple Watch ultimately be a success? Hard to say. It's folly to bet against Apple, but this is the company's first brand new product category since the iPad, and the first done without the guidance of the late visionary Steve Jobs. If nothing else, it will spur other smartwatch manufacturers to step up their game, and the competition will ultimately make wearable technology better for everyone.\n\nBut if 2020 rolls around and I'm not using my smartwatch to control my jetpack and summon my robot butler, there's going to be hell to pay.

Now the company has announced both and as you would expect from the Swiss company, this is not an affordable product.\n\nTAG Heuer did not launch its smartwatch, but did officially say it was going to make one, teaming up with Google (Android Wear) and Intel (chip tech) to complete the product. Some analysts are saying the companies arrival in the wearable market could be seismic and are comparing it to Apple?s impact.\n\nOf course, that remains to be seen, but TAG Heuer explained why it had decided to go with Google instead of building its own OS:\n\nIt would be absurd, it would be arrogant to believe that we could develop our own [operating system].

The batteries are all under the umbrella of what the company is calling Tesla Energy.\n\nIt's more exciting than it sounds.\n\nThe batteries can provide backup power during grid outages, store excess solar energy for when the sun isn't shining (instead of sending it back to the grid at wholesale prices), and store power from the electric grid when it's cheapest -- instead of tapping into the grid when energy usage is at its costly peak. This means that electric vehicle owners can store energy during the day and charge their cars with that energy at night.\n\nMusk, Tesla's CEO, hammered home his vision during a livestreamed press conference. After walking on stage, the first thing he did -- before announcing anything about Tesla Energy -- was show a picture of a coal plant and a graph of the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.\n\n\"I think we collectively should do something about this, and not try to win the Darwin Award,\" he said, referring to cheeky awards given to people who die in especially stupid ways. \"The obvious problem with solar power is that the sun doesn't shine at night. Even during the day, energy generation varies. It's important to smooth out that energy generation and retain enough so that you can use it at night.\"\n\nThe Tesla Energy batteries are a way to do that -- and to hear Musk tell it, they're much better than other storage batteries that have come before. \"The issue with existing batteries is that they suck. They're expensive, they're unreliable, they're sort of stinky, ugly, and bad in every way,\" he said.\n\nTesla's product for homes, called the PowerWall Home Battery, is made up of a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack, a control system, and software. It comes in two versions: a 10kWh/$3,500 pack, ideal for backup power applications, and a 7kWh/$3,000 version for daily use. That cost excludes installation and the inverter, so the real price could be significantly higher. The PowerWall is available to buy on Tesla's website now, with shipping in the next three or four months.\n\n\"It looks like a beautiful sculpture on the wall,\" said Musk. The PowerWall is stackable (up to nine can be stacked at once) and can be mounted in a garage or on the outside of a house.\n\nWhile it's not cheap (though as many have pointed out, it's cheaper than some editions of the Apple Watch), Musk imagines that the PowerWall -- which is already out in the wild as part of a pilot project with 300 customers of SolarCity, the solar company run by Musk's cousin -- could be used in remote parts of the world where electricity is intermittent or expensive.\n\nTesla's battery system solution for larger customers, the PowerPack, is \"designed to scale infinitely,\" according to Musk, who speculated that 160 million PowerPacks could transition the entire U.S. to renewables.\n\nA number of business customers, including Amazon, Target, and Jackson Family Wines are already using it.\n\nAmazon Web Services, for example, is planning to launch a 4.8 mWh pilot of the batteries in northern California as a way to make intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind more reliable. Jackson Family Wines already has 21 Power Packs installed, providing 4.2 MW of storage capacity.\n\nTesla is also working on a handful of utility projects, with companies like Southern California Edison and OnCor.\n\nTesla's new Nevada battery factory, the Gigafactory, will produce 50 million kWh of lithium ion batteries by 2020, and Musk hinted that a big chunk of that production capacity will be used to make PowerWalls and PowerPacks. As we mentioned previously, one of the Gigafactory's goals is to lower lithium-ion battery costs by 30%, and having dedicated production for storage batteries could make sure that it's always working at full capacity.\n\nIn order to create any sort of battery-powered renewable energy revolution, Tesla can't be the only big player. It isn't -- as Musk pointed out, other companies make battery packs already. But Tesla is also planning to open-source all patents related to its batteries, including those for the Gigafactory, which will itself be the first of many Gigafactories. We have the solar panels and the wind turbines: The next step for renewable energy is batteries.", "Apple is working on an iPad with a 12.2in screen, making it the company's largest tablet yet, according to rendered images of the new gadget leaked online.\n\nRumoured for months but not yet seen in public, the tablet - dubbed iPad Pro - will blur the lines between Apple's iPad and MacBook ranges in a bid to enter the professional tablet market currently occupied by Microsoft and its Surface Pro.\n\nPublished on Twitter by reliable technology tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer, the image is from December 2014 showing the iPad's back and sides, which appear to be made from the same aluminium as the iPad Air 2 and a USB Type C port, the same as the new 12in MacBook and replacing the Lightning connection of previous iPads.\n\nThe iPad Pro is expected to be powered by Intel's latest line of processors, known as Broadwell, which are estimated to arrive in time for Apple's annual WWDC developer conference in June. This is where the new iPad is expected to debut, alongside an updated 15in Retina MacBook Pro, also packing the new processors.\n\nAccording to the render, the iPad Pro will measure 223 x 306 x 7.2mm, compared to the 169.5 x 250 x 6.1mm of the iPad Air 2, which has a 9.7in display. Four speaker grills can be seen on the render, although given the extra processing power of the Pro model, two of them could well be for cooling rather than emitting sound.\n\nApple currently sells iPads in two sizes, the 9.7in iPad Air 2 and the 7.9in iPad mini 3.

PETERSBURG, Fla.-Poison's \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" blared from the speakers this morning as 300 credit union executives gathered to hear CSCU \u00ad\u00adSenior Vice President of Finance & Technology Tom Davis talk about the future of emerging payments at the 2015 CSCU Solutions conference in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nIntroduced as \"the Mick Jagger of payments\" by the lead singer of an '80s cover band that kicked things off, Davis spent about an hour talking about where one of the credit union industry's biggest sources of revenue is headed.\n\nThe number of credit unions is dropping, he warned, citing predictions that there will only by about 5,400 credit unions by 2018. \"Look around you; some of you might not be here by then,\" he warned. \"You have to realize the value of your payment products.\"\n\nThe mood quickly turned serious as Davis ran through the litany of companies elbowing their way into the payments sector - each carrying its own set of risks, opportunities and threats for credit unions. They included big names, such as Amazon Payments, PayPal, Apple Pay, Square, Isis, Google, Samsung and even Facebook, which launched a payment feature within its Messenger tool in March. \"Facebook?!\" Davis exclaimed. \"Who the heck thought Facebook would start taking payments?\"\n\nTo Davis, the opportunities in emerging payments seem to outweigh the risks, however. \"We're going to be OK,\" he told the crowd. \"We're going to be just fine.\"\n\nMuch of his focus was on Apple Pay, which he said is still a small player despite its highly publicized launch.\n\nThough about two-thirds of contactless dollars go through Apple Pay right now, he said, Apple Pay as a whole is just 0.07% of consumer spend. In fact, he said, 85% of iPhone 6 users who have credit cards haven't used Apple Pay.\n\n\"It hasn't taken off yet,\" he said. \"There's a lot of talk about it. We know it's there, but we've still got a long way to go. There's a lot of disinterest in that space right now. It's just not there yet.

Apple, for its part, acknowledged the issue on its support website.\n\n\"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance,\" the site reads. \"The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\"\n\nSeveral watch owners complained about the problem on social media this week, even posting videos that show the watch working well on an undecorated wrist, but repeatedly locking or pausing when worn on an arm with a tattoo. Some said it appeared the watch's screen-lock feature was triggering because the sensors thought the watch was not sitting on their wrist.\n\nThat was frustrating and \"a bit embarrassing\" for Graham Edgell, a Los Angeles printing broker who loves Apple products and was eager to show off his new watch to friends after his wife bought it for him. Edgell, 38, said he thought a software glitch was interfering with the watch's message notifications and other features, until he heard about others having trouble with their tattoos.\n\nEdgell solved his problem by moving the watch further down on his wrist, away from the dark floral tattoo that stops just above the cuff of his shirt sleeve. \"When it was on the tattoo, it was as if it had lost connection with my skin,\" he said. \"Now it's absolutely fine.\"\n\nThe watch tracks heart rates through a common medical technique that measures how much light is absorbed by blood. An Apple representative referred a reporter to the company's website, which explains \"Apple Watch uses green LED lights paired with light-sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats, the blood flow in your wrist -- and the green light absorption -- is greater.\"\n\nWhile the problem doesn't occur with all tattoos, it may be more likely to affect people with dark red or black ink on the side of the wrist where they wear their watch, according to anecdotal accounts.\n\n\"So far it's not been an issue,\" said Nick Borelli, a 34-year-old marketing executive in Cleveland. He has a black tattoo on the inside of his wrist -- but not the side where he has worn the Apple Watch. He added that he likes the watch but worries the glitch could affect a large \"target demographic\" of young, tech-savvy people with tattoos, who are likely to be interested in the watch as a gadget and fashion accessory.\n\nThe same problem may affect other fitness bands that use that method. At least one tattooed owner of a Fitbit device posted a similar complaint on the Reddit online forum in January. A Fitbit representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIf tattoos can interfere with the way light is absorbed through the skin, there so far doesn't appear to be a problem with dark skin or scars. Some experts say natural skin pigmentation wouldn't block the green light used by Apple, although researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have found dark skin can affect the results of blood oxygen sensors that use infrared light.\n\nThe tech industry has confronted problems with skin coloring in the past. Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard both fielded complaints several years ago about facial recognition sensors in gaming consoles and computers that struggled to detect people with dark skin. Both companies suggested poor lighting interfered with the sensors' ability to measure the contrast between eyes and other facial features.\n\nAs for the Apple Watch issue, some social media users have mocked it as a complaint from spoiled hipsters. Others wondered how it happened that Apple didn't have a single designer or tester with a wrist tattoo who would have noticed the problem. Apple suggests that users who can't get a consistent heart rate reading connect their Apple Watch wirelessly to external heart rate monitors.\n\nThis isn't Apple's first \"-gate\" problem. \"Antennagate\" in 2010 was a short-lived problem with the iPhone 4's antenna design, which caused reception problems when people covered a certain spot on the antenna with their bare hand.\n\nThough it created an uproar at the time, \"Antennagate\" didn't seem to hurt the iPhone's popularity or sour Apple's devoted fan base -- and it seems unlikely that \"TattooGate\" will make or break the Apple Watch.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market bounced back on Friday as investors picked up companies that had dropped earlier in the week. Major indexes recovered nearly all their losses from a fall the day before.\n\n\"It's an odd day in the markets,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. The news out Friday was mostly disappointing, he said. Big corporations' earnings reports weren't all that good.\n\nExpedia was an exception. The online travel company turned in sales that topped Wall Street's estimates, driving its stock up $7.46, or 8 percent, to $101.69.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 22.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 2,108.29. That's after dropping 1 percent the day before.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 183.54 points, or 1 percent, to 18,024.06, while the Nasdaq composite rose 63.97 points, 1.3 percent, to 5,005.39.\n\nCharlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, cautioned against reading too much into a day with light trading. \"The rally is fun,\" he said, \"but it doesn't mean much.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq lost 1.7 percent for the week as investors sold many of the technology companies that have fared well this year. Strong gains for Apple and other tech stocks helped the Nasdaq finally topple a record high last Thursday. So, what changed?\n\nSmith said Apple's earnings had something to do with it. Apple is big enough that its moves can swing the Nasdaq higher or lower. Last week, investors bought Apple's stock in anticipation of another blowout earnings report when the tech giant reported results Monday. In the three days afterward, Apple's stock lost 6 percent.\n\nLinkedIn plunged after the online networking service warned of weaker earnings in the months ahead, a result of the stronger dollar and the company's pending purchase of Lynda.com, an online learning company. Twitter continued a slump started earlier in the week when the company turned in disappointing sales and cut its revenue outlook. Twitter dropped $1.12, or 3 percent, to $37.84, while LinkedIn lost $46.92, or 19 percent, to $205.21.\n\nRoughly a third of all the companies in the S&P 500 reported first-quarter results this week, and the news was mixed. Falling oil prices and a rising dollar hammered many of them. Analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 will say overall earnings inched up 0.6 percent compared with the same period of last year, according to S&P Capital IQ, a provider of financial information. But revenue is expected to drop 1.4 percent.\n\nAblin said that investors are wrestling with a slew of diverging trends. Recent reports have raised concerns about the economy's strength. On Wednesday, the government said that it nearly stopped growing in the first three months of the year. To some investors that's not such bad news: Weak economic growth could lead the Federal Reserve to postpone its plans to raise a key borrowing rate. Record low interest rates have helped the stock market soar since the financial crisis.\n\n\"Economic data has recently been disappointing,\" Ablin said, \"but that keeps the Fed offstage.\"\n\nIn Europe, the only major market open for trading was in Britain, where the FTSE 100 finished with a gain of 0.4 percent.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4 percent. New Zealand's benchmark rose 0.1 percent. Most markets in Asia and Europe were closed for the International Workers Day holiday.\n\nBack in the U.S., government bond prices sank, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.12 percent from 2.03 percent the day before.\n\nIn commodities trading, gold dropped $7.90 to end at $1,174.50 an ounce, while silver lost 2 cents to $16.14 an ounce. Copper added 4 cents to $2.93 a pound.\n\nOil fell nearly 1 percent Friday, the first trading day in May, following a gain of more than 20 percent the month before. U.S. oil slid 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $59.15 a barrel. Brent crude slipped 32 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $66.46 a barrel.\n\nIn other trading:\n\n-- Wholesale gasoline was barely changed at $2.045 a gallon.", "A support page on Apple's website confirmed that some tattoos can disrupt the Apple Watch heart-rate sensor.\n\nReports surfaced in recent days that the Apple Watch ran into trouble for some users whose wrists had tattoos. On Apple's website, a page dedicated to monitoring heart rate cites several factors, such as motion and blood flow, that can disrupt the reading. Tattoos are one of them:\n\nPermanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance. The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings.\n\nThe page was updated April 29. Apple didn't have additional comment beyond the statement on the support page.\n\nThe problem doesn't affect every person with a tattoo using the wearable. Whether this will be a big deal for buyers depends on whether they are drawn to Apple Watch as a fitness wearable. The Journal's Joanna Stern recently wrote that fitness bands just can't compete with the emerging class of smartwatches.\n\nApple's support page lists other ways people can measure heart rate. The blog 9to5Mac earlier reported the update to Apple's support site.", "Is it a toy, or is it a tool? A novelty gimmick, or necessary gizmo? One tech company's most baffling bauble, or the herald of a new era in wrist-mounted personal computers?\n\nOne thing's for certain: there's no shortage of opinions about the Apple Watch.\n\nApple's big bet on wearable technology is now out in the wild, and lots has already been said about it. About how it connects you to important things going on in your digital life, with buzzwords such as Glances and Digital Crown and Force Touch, which sounds vaguely like a Darth Vader sex move.\n\nIn order to get a figurative and literal grip on Apple's latest device, I bought two Apple Watches to put through their paces: a 42 mm grey aluminum model with a plastic sport strap ($519) and a stainless steel 38 mm model with a classic leather strap ($849). Note to my bosses: one or both of these are going on eBay by the end of the week. I don't get paid enough to keep them.\n\nI'm not going to describe all of the Apple Watch's core features, or tell you how you swipe, tap and poke it. For that, check out the guided tour videos below on apple.ca/watch. Perhaps with the volume down, as their voiceovers are uniquely grating.\n\nI'm here to tell you what's good about Apple's foray into wearable tech, and what's not. What they've done right, and what they haven't. And to offer 10 things I like about the Apple Watch, and 10 things I really don't.\n\nNobody does industrial design quite like Apple, and the Apple Watch is no exception. Both the aluminum and stainless steel models are lovely to look at, and the tiny screen is dazzling. Most smartwatches are bulky beasts, but even the 42 mm Apple Watch is surprisingly light and comfortable. It won't rival a Rolex or Breitling for style, but it also doesn't scream, \"Hey, look at me! I'm wearing a giant freakin' computer on my wrist!\"\n\nIt's great at poking you\n\nAside from telling the time - with customizable watch faces ranging from animated jellyfish to Mickey Mouse - the Apple Watch's most useful feature is giving your wrist a gentle vibration when it needs to tell you something, and displaying the information on its screen. Whether it's an iMessage, a calendar reminder, a Stanley Cup playoff score or any of the other thousands of potential notifications, the Apple Watch wants to feed you bite-sized pieces of data at the appropriate moment. And it does that pretty well.\n\nYou can make phone calls on your wrist\n\nWant to feel like George Jetson? Try making or receiving phone calls on your watch. The sound quality from the Apple Watch speaker is a bit tinny (although my friends say my voice sounds fine on their end), but the mere fact you're holding a conversation by talking into your wrist feels very sci-fi. Very Dick Tracy. Very Secret Service. Or maybe just very silly.\n\nDigital Touch is dumb but amazing\n\nOne of the goofiest features of the Apple Watch is its so-called Digital Touch, which allows you to send special types of messages to other Apple Watch owners - taps, fingertip doodles and even your heartbeat. It sounds dopey, and it is, but it's also a lot of fun. The first thing I did with my watch was to send a penis doodle to my friend, and if that's not a glorious use of technology, I don't know what is. Taps are a fun way to annoy your watch-owning pals, and sending your heartbeat to a special someone could be an intimate way of telling them you're thinking about them. The faster your heartbeat, the more vigorously you're... thinking about them.\n\nIt makes fitness (sort of) fun\n\nThe Apple Watch has a built-in activity monitor and workout app, and several companies, including Nike and Strava, have launched fitness apps for the watch. It's oddly motivating to get little digital trophies for hitting your weekly activity goals, or to get helpful reminders from the Lifesum app to drink some water before dinner so you don't eat as much. Advice which you then promptly ignore, and order the full-size chorizo nachos. Not for sharing.\n\nThe heart-rate monitor really works\n\nI expected the Apple Watch's built-in heart rate monitor to be flaky, as many wrist-worn monitors are, but I did a side-by-side comparison with a chest-strap heart monitor and the results were surprising. During a 30-minute cardio workout, the Apple Watch was never off by more than five beats per minute from the chest-strap monitor, and was usually within two or three. It's not accurate enough for professional athletes (and the watch tracks changes in heart rate more slowly than a dedicated heart monitor), but it's not too shabby.\n\nIt listens to you\n\nBy raising your wrist and saying \"Hey Siri\" or holding the Digital Crown button down for a second, you can activate the Apple Watch's version of the iPhone's voice-driven assistant, Siri. Since typing on the watch's wee screen just isn't feasible, this is the way to do everything from asking for driving directions (\"Hey Siri, take me home\") to texting someone (\"Hey Siri, send a message to James saying please buy an Apple Watch so I can send you offensive doodles.\") The downside is that when dictating a message, there's no way to edit Siri's transcription before sending it. If you mess up, you need to start again from scratch, or just send the message as a voice note.\n\nYou can control your iPhone camera with it\n\nThis isn't a new feature on smartwatches, but it's especially well-implemented on the Apple Watch. Tap the camera icon and the screen will show a live feed from your iPhone camera, allowing you to take photos or activate a three-second countdown timer. You can't switch to the iPhone's front-facing camera or use any other camera modes - including video recording - but it's one of those little gimmicks that makes you go, \"Heh, neat.\"\n\nThe hand-off feature is (mostly) well done\n\nWhen an Apple Watch app runs up against something it can't do on its own, it will often prompt you to pull out your iPhone and continue using the full-fledged version of the app. While not all apps support this hand-off feature, it's seamless in those that do - just swipe up on the app icon in the lower left corner of your iPhone lock screen, and it will pick up at the spot you left off on the watch.\n\nSome apps work really well\n\nWant to know when the next bus is coming? Tap the Transit app and see all the routes nearest to you. Want to know if your flight is delayed? Tap the Air Canada, WestJet or other airline app for updates on flights that you've entered into your iPhone. Want to pay for that non-fat, extra-hot hazelnut latte? The watch's Passbook app stores scannable barcodes for many rewards cards, including Starbucks. (Apple Pay, the tap-and-go payment system being rolled out in the U.S., is rumoured to be coming to Canada this fall.) Yes, all this stuff can be done on your iPhone - the reality is almost anything that can be done on the Apple Watch can be done on your iPhone - but some tasks are especially well-suited to quick glances at your wrist.\n\nApple Watch apps can take anywhere from two to 10 seconds to launch, and some in particular - such as the Maps app - are especially slow to pull data over the Bluetooth connection that tethers the watch to your iPhone. The act of raising your wrist to turn on the watch's display (which is always off by default) can also take a second to register, which can be disconcerting until you get used to it. Maybe it's to be expected in a first-generation product, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.\n\nThe app screen is a mess\n\nOnce you start downloading a few - or a few dozen - apps to your watch, you'll be faced with an ever-expanding galaxy of tiny circular icons floating on your Apple Watch home screen. While you can rearrange their placement, there's no way to group them, no way to delete or hide the default Apple apps and no way to know what icon belongs to what app without actually launching it, as they lack labels of any sort. Most of the app icons are fairly intuitive, but you'll inevitably reach a point where you have apps that you can't even identify. It's a fustercluck.\n\nThe Apple Watch's e-mail app will show you the contents of your inboxes and selected folders, let you read plain text messages and... that's about it. You can use Force Touch - a stronger push on the screen, sort of like a right click on a mouse - to delete, flag or mark e-mails as unread, but there's not even a rudimentary way to reply to e-mails. You can, however, use the hand-off feature to open an e-mail up on your iPhone and reply to it there.\n\nOther than music - you can use the Apple Watch to control playback on your iPhone, or store up to 2 GB of music on the watch itself to jam out to via Bluetooth headphones - the Apple Watch isn't designed for media consumption. It's surprisingly bad even for looking at photos, with a very minimal level of zoom, and there's no video playback option at all. Why would I want to look at photos or watch videos on such a tiny screen? Because I'm wearing a $500 computer on my wrist, and it would be cool. Is that too much to ask?\n\nThere aren't enough ways to customize notifications\n\nWhile you can freely choose which apps will tap your wrist and emit a little \"ding!\" when they have something to tell you, there's no way to assign different patterns of taps or alerts to different apps, and the watch won't mirror the custom sound and vibration patterns you've set on your iPhone. It would be really helpful to not have to look at the screen to know the difference between an incoming VIP e-mail and the watch prompting you to haul your butt out of your chair and stand up for a while.\n\nThe only sounds I've heard from my Apple Watch are alerts, alarms and the voice of the person I'm talking to on the phone. Most apps seem to have no audio at all, and even the GPS navigation on the Maps app only uses dings and vibrations to notify you of upcoming turns, rather than spoken directions. Which means glancing at your wrist to see which way you're supposed to turn, which means almost rear-ending a city bus and scaring the crap out of your passenger. Um, hypothetically. That didn't happen to me. Maybe.\n\nLots of apps haven't reached their potential yet\n\nAside from the App Store already being crowded with a hodgepodge of useless or redundant Apple Watch apps (including no fewer than two dozen dice-rolling apps), even some the slick, professional apps feel oddly hamstrung. For example, you can use the Amazon app to search for products by voice (and even order them right from your watch, if you're brave enough to have one-click ordering turned on), but the app only returns five search results, with no way to request more. There will inevitably be updates that address some of these shortcomings, but right now a lot of Apple Watch apps fall on the wrong side of the line between usefulness and novelty.\n\nThe battery lasts less than 24 hours\n\nApple says you should be able to get 18 hours of Apple Watch use on a single battery charge, and unless you're constantly fiddling with the thing, you'll likely get even more. But you're going to have to get into the habit of connecting it to its magnetic charging cable every night at bedtime (which negates the Apple Watch's potential usefulness as a sleep tracker, something I really like about the Pebble watch.) The watch does have a low-power reserve mode in which it does nothing more than tell the time, but then it ceases being an Apple Watch and becomes just a, you know, watch-watch.\n\nThere will be a better one out next year\n\nMany major tech companies refresh their popular products every 12 to 18 months, and given Apple's track record with this, there's no reason to expect the Apple Watch will be any different. If you buy one, know that you're buying a first-generation product that will be rendered obsolete in a year and a half at the outside. Apple Watch 2 or Apple Watch Air or Apple Watch Pro - whatever they decide to call it - will be Apple's thinnest, lightest, bestest, most awesomely magically personal watch ever when it comes out, and you'll be left holding something that feels a bit slow, fat and ugly.\n\nIt's too expensive\n\nThis is the biggest sticking point with the Apple Watch. The minimum entry point is $449 for the 38 mm aluminum sport watch, and tops out at $1,459 for the 42 mm black stainless steel watch with a link bracelet. (Or you can get an Apple Watch Edition model, starting at $13,000. But you're not going to do that, because you have at least a shred of common sense.) And the Apple Watch strap prices - running from $69 to $599 - feel like nothing short of robbery. Hopefully third-party straps will be on the market soon, because if you're willing to pay $599 for a watch strap, you are a fool. And as the saying goes, you and your money are soon parted.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nThe Apple Watch is a beautiful little toy. It doesn't do much that you can't do with your iPhone, but after only five days of wearing one, my wrist already feels a bit naked when I take it off. Wait, what? I have to look at my PHONE to see who's messaging me? What is this, the dark ages of 2010?\n\nThat said, the Apple Watch is not fully baked, not in its current form. Like the first-generation iPhone that launched in 2007, it needs time for its software to mature, and another generation or two for its hardware to become more robust. Wearable technology is the future, there's no denying that. But while the Apple Watch is probably the best and most beautiful smartwatch you can currently buy, these devices are still in their infancy.\n\nWill the Apple Watch ultimately be a success? Hard to say. It's folly to bet against Apple, but this is the company's first brand new product category since the iPad, and the first done without the guidance of the late visionary Steve Jobs. If nothing else, it will spur other smartwatch manufacturers to step up their game, and the competition will ultimately make wearable technology better for everyone.\n\nBut if 2020 rolls around and I'm not using my smartwatch to control my jetpack and summon my robot butler, there's going to be hell to pay. Get on that, Apple. Someone's got to.", "It's seemed like a long wait from when rumors of the Apple Watch first emerged two years ago to April 10, 2015, when Apple began accepting pre-orders. I was one of the lucky early purchasers and my Watch has finally arrived. So was all that anticipation worth it?\n\nI bought the 42mm stainless steel model with the black sports band for $599 (the smaller 38mm model costs $50 less); it arrived four days after the official April 24 ship date. Currently, orders placed online show a June ship date, and the devices are expected to be available in Apple stores in June.\n\nAs of this writing, I've spent about 48 hours with the Watch and I'm still growing accustomed to its ins and outs. So far, I've used it to track workouts, control music, send messages, get directions and look up currently-playing songs using Shazam -- and I may have even looked at it once or twice to tell the time. This is a collection of my first impressions.\n\nAn impressive design\n\nMy first thought when I took the Watch out of its box was that it's much smaller than I expected; I even checked the label to make sure I had received the 42mm version. If you haven't seen one in person, it's clear that close-up photos let you see the design details, but definitely give the Watch an appearance of bulk. In the hand, or on the wrist, this isn't the case at all.\n\nNeither the stainless steel nor the aluminum model (which I had a chance to look at earlier) feels cheap. The stainless steel version comes with a ceramic back, which covers the heart rate monitoring sensors, and a sapphire crystal display. The quality of the build process and materials used is evident, even with the sport band (which is made of fluoroelastomer, a material that feels like soft, rubberized plastic). I found the Watch to be very comfortable to wear and not obtrusive, whether I was working out or just wearing it casually.\n\nThe Watch looks and feels like an actual watch, complete with a crown on the side which Apple calls a Digital Crown. The Digital Crown gives the user manual control, allowing you to zoom into apps, scroll through lists, and make changes to settings. It works in concert with the Watch's haptic feedback, so it's easy to tell when you've reached the end of lists, for instance.\n\nNext to the Digital Crown is the side button, which gives quick access to your list of contacts and different ways to connect with them. From that list, you can send them messages and emoticons, call their phones, or, if they have an Apple Watch, send sketches, taps or your heartbeat.\n\nThe other important technology is the Force Touch display, which offers access to settings or other hidden options via touch screen when you press down on the screen more firmly. (It's the same haptic feedback technology used in the new MacBook's trackpad.) I found it worked well in daily use. Force Touch provides access to a variety of options without cluttering up the interface with superfluous icons or menus.\n\nGetting started\n\nThe initial setup and pairing process is pretty slick, even for Apple. After I removed the Watch from its casing and pressed the side button, startup took about a minute. Once the Watch boots up for the first time, you then have to tap the screen to select a language. It then needs to be paired -- for that, both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have to be enabled on the iPhone. Tap on the Start Pairing buttons on both devices, and the process is initiated.\n\nAt this point, a \"swirling dust\" animation begins on the Watch. On the iPhone, the rear camera is activated and a Watch-sized square appears on the screen. You have to align the Watch display within this square to initiate the link. Once the two devices are linked, the iPhone displays a similar animation that syncs up with the one on the Watch.\n\nApple has provided videos and a user's guide to help new owners get started.\n\nIf you were anticipating its arrival as much as I was, you're likely already aware that the Watch is designed to offer quicker access through Watch apps to functions you'd normally do on the phone, such as receiving notifications and alerts, and to track fitness and health goals.\n\nCustomization and personalization is key to using the Watch, but customizing the various faces and application settings can feel daunting and even a little overwhelming at first. There are so many configuration options available -- and that's before you take into account third-party Apps and Glances.\n\nThe Watch comes with a variety of faces, most of which can be tweaked by force-pressing the face and tapping Customize. But you need to use the Watch app on the iPhone to configure app preferences. There are default settings in place on the iPhone app to help get you up and running as quickly as possible -- mostly by mimicking the way your iPhone apps are configured -- and that's probably the best way to proceed at first. Over time, you can then decide which apps you need, and which notifications you want; I found that I had to cut down considerably on the number of notifications I'd allow to interrupt my day.\n\nUsing the Watch is fascinating. Compared to the iPhone and iPad, it is not as intuitive a device, mostly because the interactions happen on such a small display. I spent the first couple of days poking, pressing and guessing what could be done, or even what should be done on the Watch instead of the phone.\n\nI also had to learn the difference between a Glance (a quick way to get at an app's data, which can be accessed from the Watch face by swiping up and then side-to-side to switch between various bits of information), a Notification (which is an alert from an app that's can be accessed from the Watch face by swiping down) and an App (which can be launched by tapping on the associated Glance or Notification, or by pressing the Digital Crown to access the App screen).\n\nSome first impressions\n\nTwo days isn't a lot of time to offer a comprehensive look at all the Apple Watch can do, but some things stick out immediately. Here are a few things that struck me in my initial tryout:\n\n\" The Watch is better with less. I recommend only keeping the Apps and Glances you actually use, and that you customize the settings to only allow important notifications to get through. Otherwise, all you're doing is shifting interruptions from your pocket to your wrist.\n\n\" From what I'd read, I expected the Watch to be slow -- and sometimes it is. Some apps take longer to load than others, and sometimes the Watch face will turn itself off before the App or Glance is actually loaded. Hopefully, future software updates by Apple and third-party developers will offer optimizations that speed things up a little.\n\n\" There are tons of nice little touches spread throughout the Watch. For instance, you can long-press to clear all notifications; you can use the Settings Glance to ping your iPhone when you misplace it; you can cover the Watch display with your hand to mute and turn off the display. And I really like that the Watch's haptic feedback taps your wrist using different patterns to direct you in Maps; it's now possible to get directions without Siri constantly interrupting currently-playing music.\n\n\" The Watch can be used for making payments at retail locations that accept Apple Pay, so I set up all of my credit cards using the Watch app on the iPhone. (Even if you've already set up Apple Pay on your iPhone, you have to do it again for the Watch.) Doing so requires a passcode, and since the passcode need only be entered when you put the Watch on -- it detects when the owner takes it off as a security measure -- I recommend a longer, more secure passcode (especially since making a payment doesn't require any passcode entry at all).\n\n\" In my opinion, the volume for Watch alerts is too low, even when the sound is set to its highest setting.\n\nAlso, the haptic engine is a lot softer than I thought it would be. It's possible that I received a defective unit -- according to The Wall Street Journal, problems with this component is the primary reason for the Watch's delay and short supplies. (When the madness dies down, I'm going to visit an Apple store and see if it there is a problem with my Watch. In my follow-up review later this month I should have more information.)\n\n\" I use Siri all of the time on my iPhone, and I'm using it even more on the Watch. The only problem is that the \"Hey, Siri\" command to activate the feature sometimes isn't recognized and I often have to repeat myself.\n\n\" Whenever I lift the Watch, it's usually to look at the face to tell the time. But sometimes I want to view the last app and continue doing what I was doing. You can set this option in the Watch app on your iPhone, or on the fly, just double-press the Digital Crown. That returns you to the last app used.\n\n\" I have read some reviews complaining that raising the Watch doesn't activate the display fast enough. I feel the Watch responds appropriately, but then again, I'm not a traditional watch wearer. For the past six months I've been using a Microsoft Band, and I'm accustomed to having to press a button to check the time. The fact that the Apple Watch turns on the display with a flick of the wrist is a step up for me.\n\nThat said, I can see how the Watch -- which keeps the display off most of the time to save power -- might seem slow to someone accustomed to a traditional watch.\n\nWhat is a problem, though, is that the Watch display turns off far too quickly. Sometimes the Watch will turn itself off before an App or Glance has even finished loading. Touching the Watch display instantly turns it on again, but that should be unnecessary. There should be a way to lengthen the time before the display shuts itself off.\n\n\" I really like how Handoff -- the process of moving a task from the Watch to your iPhone -- is implemented. For example, at one point I dictated a note using the Watch; however, I then got an alert saying that I had to complete the task on the phone. I pulled out my iPhone, pressed the Home Button to turn on the display, and swiped up on the little Siri icon on the bottom left of the Lock Screen. When I did that, Siri on the iPhone confirmed that my note was taken.\n\nThe logical question remains: What is the point of having the Watch if you still have to complete tasks (such as taking a note) on the iPhone? That issue could be a deal-breaker for some -- but not for me. Not all of the tasks Siri does on the Watch need to be completed on the iPhone, but for those that do, it's nice to know that the action will be transferred intact to another device. That's pretty neat integration, even if it is implemented to compensate for a shortcoming.\n\n\" Another issue: My heart rate monitor was off-base during a couple of my workouts, including just this morning; I like to think I'm calm and zen, but it was clear that the Watch wasn't picking up my heart rate accurately. A restart cleared up the issue temporarily, but for people with tattoos, the heart rate monitoring may not work properly. If this continues, I'm going to reach out to Apple and see if this is a known issue (and no, I don't have tattoos.)\n\nBottom line\n\nAfter a couple of days using it, I think the Watch is an interesting device. It's clearly only an accessory to the iPhone and not a necessary one, but it's also useful in very specific ways -- such as giving discreet directions and gentle reminders to move, tracking your fitness and integrating with the Apple Health app. It's also a device that you need to spend time with to appreciate fully.\n\nSo was the Apple Watch worth the wait? I'd say, yes. As I noted, I'm not someone who normally wears jewelry or watches. However, the Apple Watch may change my mind.\n\nJoin the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high-speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

(ASE, \u65e5\u6708\u5149), the world's largest integrated circuit designer, is expected to post an almost 10 percent quarterly increase in sales for the April to June period on the back of Apple Inc. orders, market analysts said Friday.\n\nThey said orders from Apple for the production of its Apple Watch, which was released in certain countries earlier this month, could help ASE offset the effects of the second-quarter slow season.\n\nASE is likely to post \"high single-digit\" sales growth for the three-month period, the analysts said.\n\nTheir forecast reflected ASE's projection at an investor conference Thursday that its sales in IC packaging and testing services and in electronics manufacturing services will grow on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.\n\nBased on the forecast of rising sales, analysts said, ASE is expected to spend more than US$800 million in 2015 to expand production capacity. The company's 2015 capex forecast was just shy of the US$1.05 billion it spent last year.\n\nAnalysts said ASE's investments will focus on advanced technology processes, including bumping services, flip-chip packaging and testing, wafer level packaging, and system-in-package technology.\n\nIn the first quarter, ASE posted NT$4.47 billion (US$146 million) in net profit, down 43 percent from the previous quarter due to the slow season. However, the January-March figure represented a 30 percent year-on-year increase and the highest ever first-quarter net profit in the company's history.\n\nASE's first-quarter consolidated sales dropped by a quarterly 15.6 percent to NT$64.66 billion, which was, however, an 18.2 percent year-on-year increase. ASE said its top 10 clients accounted for about 53 percent of its total first-quarter revenue.\n\nSales generated from services for chips used in communications devices made up 55 percent of ASE's total revenue in the first quarter, services for chips used in autos and consumer electronics gadgets represented 34 percent, and services for chips used in personal computers accounted for 11 percent.\n\nIn the first quarter, ASE's gross margin on a consolidated basis stood at 19 percent, down from 21.4 percent in the previous quarter but up from 18.9 percent a year earlier.\n\nIts operating margin for the January-March period fell to 9.7 percent from 12.8 percent in the previous quarter but was higher than the 9.3 percent recorded a year earlier.\n\nEarlier this week, it competitor Siliconware Precision Industries Co.

Messengers nearby bid on the job. One might be able to deliver the item within an hour for $20. Another could do it for $10, but it'll take longer. Users can see what types of vehicles the messengers are using -- whether it's a Toyota Prius or a scooter or a bicycle or a Metro pass -- how many deliveries they've completed and their rating on the app. Users select a messenger, he or she picks it up, and the app tracks the item on a map.

However, its other usage cannot be ignored -- the audio jack can also be used to transmit data.\n\nMore usages of the audio jack to connect devices are being developed all the time. Peripherals like iHealth Lab's Glucometer[1] (blood sugar calculator), the Irdroid[2] (provides infrared remote functions to control TVs, set-top boxes, and audio components), and Flojack*[3], an NFC reader (creates near-field-communications functionality for interaction with NFC tags or mobile devices) are made possible through audio jack connectivity.\n\nSince wearable devices and peripherals have broad market prospects, I believe that the audio jack will be the prime data communication portal. In this article I will explain more details of this new feature.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe audio jack interface has two standards: OMTP and CTIA[4]. OMTP is an international standard; ATIS is an American standard, which is used on the Apple iPhone* and iPad*. They are different with V-Mic and GND position, the difference are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. OMTP & CTIA How to transmit data\n\nWhen we send a 0x00FF data value, the first step is to convert the digital data value to an analog signal. We need to modulate the data value. Normally, we use a sine wave carrier for the analog signal.\n\nFigure 2. FSK[5] modulation signal[6]\n\nThe second step, in Android systems, is to call the audioTrack API[7] function to play the buffer. The following code sends data to the buffer using the audioTrack function.\n\npublic void send(byte[] bytes_pkg) { int bufsize = AudioTrack.getMinBufferSize(8000, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT); AudioTrack trackplayer = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 8000, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, bufsize, AudioTrack.MODE_STREAM); trackplayer.play(); trackplayer.write(bytes_pkg, 0, bytes_pkg.length); } How to receive data\n\nAs a receiver, we need to translate the analog signal to a data value, demodulate the signal to remove the carrier signal, and decode the data by protocol. The protocol can be a public data format or private definition protocol.\n\nFigure 3. Demodulate the signal6]\n\nIn Android systems, we use the audioRecord API[8] function to record the audio\n\npublic void receive(){ int minBufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(AUDIO_SAMPLE_FREQ, 2, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT); AudioRecord ar = new AudioRecord(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC, AUDIO_SAMPLE_FREQ, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_MONO, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, minBufferSize); ar.startRecording(); } How to harvest energy from audio signals\n\nObviously, power is required to drive the circuit for audio jack peripherals. For example, the L-channel sends data information. The R-channel sends sustained square or sine waveforms. These waveforms can be transformed to power that enables the MCU (Micro Controller Unit) and several sensors.\n\nCase study: infrared peripherals\n\nAndrolirc[9] is a Github-based project. Its function is to use the audio jack interface to send infrared commands. We can study this project to understand audio jack data communication. Androlirc uses the LIRC[10] library to create a data buffer. This library is a Linux* infrared library that supports several types of interfaces, for example: USB, audio jack, etc. Androlirc can use the LIRC library as a data encapsulation or data capsulation. Across the marketplace, you can find many infrared coding types, such as the RC-5 and RC-6 protocols. In the example, we use the RC-5 protocol to control a TV set. First, we need to modulate the data value using a 38k frequency sine waveform to generate buffer data; then we use the Android audio API function to play the audio buffer data. Meanwhile we can use one of two channels to play a sine or square waveform to power on the peripherals hardware.\n\nCase study: audio jack development tools\n\nNXP Semiconductors' new smartphone solution, Quick-Jack*[11], is a tool/development board based on a prototype project called Hijack. Hijack[12] is a University of Michigan student project. The Hijack platform enables a new class of small, cheap, phone-centric sensor peripherals that support plug-and-play operations. We can use the NXP Quick-Jack developed board to help build our prototype product design. Figure 4 shows a smartphone displaying the indoor temperature from the audio jack-based peripheral temperature sensor.\n\nFigure 4. Temperature value from Quick-Jack\n\nFigure 5 shows how we can control the peripheral's LED using an Android-based application.\n\nFigure 5. Controlling the LED on the Quick-Jack Summary\n\nWearables and smart device peripherals are becoming more prevalent in the consumer market. The audio jack as a data communication function is being adopted by more and more ODMs and iMakers. Perhaps in the future, audio jack data communication functions will be universally supported by smartphone OSs.\n\nReference http://www.ihealthlabs.com/glucometer/ihealth-align/ http://www.irdroid.com/ https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flomio/flojack-nfc-for-ipad-and-iphone http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/4676 http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioTrack.html http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html https://github.com/zokama http://lirc.org http://www.nxp.com/news/press-releases/2014/05/nxp-unveils-smartphone-quick-jack-solution-transforming-audio-jack-into-multi-purpose-self-powered-data-port.html http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/projects/hijack/ About the Author\n\nLi Liang earned his Master degree in signal and information processing from Changchun University of Technology.

In September 2013, Apple released the iPhone* 5 with a 64-bit A7 processor onboard. Thus began the mobile technology race.\n\nIt turns out that the Android-based kernel GNU/Linux* has been supporting processors with 64-bit registers for a long time. Ubuntu is \"GNU/Linux\" while Android is \"Dalvik/Linux\". Dalvik is the process virtual machine (VM) in Google's Android operating system, which specifically executes applications written for Android. This makes Dalvik an integral part of the Android software stack, which is typically used on mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers, as well as more recently on devices such as smart TVs and wearables. Nevertheless, all developers who use the NDK have to rebuild their programs under the latest architecture, and the ease or difficulty of this process depends on the tools that Google will provide. In addition, Google should provide backward compatibility, i.e., NDK 32-bit applications should run in Android 64-bit.\n\nThe first Intel 64-bit processors for mobile devices were created in the 3rd quarter of 2013 and were the new powerful multicore System on a Chip (SoC) for mobile and desktop devices. This new SoC family consists of Intel\u00ae AtomTM processors for tablets and 2 in 1 devices, Intel\u00ae Celeron\u00ae processors, and Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae processors for 2 in 1 devices, laptops, desktop PCs and All in One PCs.\n\nIn October 2014, Google released a preview emulator image of the 64-bit Android L for developers. This allowed them to test their programs and rewrite code, if necessary, before the OS is released. In a Google+ blog developers indicated that programs entirely created with Java* do not require porting. They ran them \"as is\" in the L- version of the emulator, which supports 64-bit architecture. Those using other languages, especially C and C++, will have to perform some steps to build against the new Android NDK. Several older versions of Android-based devices with 64-bit processors are on the market. However, manufacturers may have to update them rather quickly; otherwise, there will be a lack of software apps for users.\n\nAndroid 64-bit L emulator\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced that Android would support 64-bit in the coming L release. This is great news for those who want the most performance possible out of their devices and apps. The list of benefits highlighted by Google in this update include a larger number of registers, increased addressable memory space, and new instruction sets.\n\nThe Android emulator supports many hardware features likely to be found on mobile devices, including:\n\nAn ARM* v5 CPU and the corresponding memory-management unit (MMU) A 16-bit LCD display One or more keyboards (a Qwerty-based keyboard and associated Dpad/Phone buttons) A sound chip with output and input capabilities Flash memory partitions (emulated through disk image files on the development machine) A GSM modem, including a simulated SIM Card A camera, using a webcam connected to your development computer. Sensors like an accelerometer, using data from a USB-connected Android device\n\nThis is a great step forward for building our favorite devices and apps. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait for Android L to drop before we can enjoy these new performance boosts. A few weeks after Android L releases, Revision 10 of the Native Development Kit (NDK) should be posted with support for the three 64-bit architectures that will be able to run the new version of Android: arm64-v8a, x86_64, and mips64. If you've built an app using Java, your code will automatically have better performance on the new x86 64-bit architecture. Google has updated the NDK to revision 10b and added an emulator image developers can use to prepare their apps to run on devices built with Intel's 64-bit chips.\n\nKeep in mind, the NDK is only for native apps, not those built with Java on the regular Android SDK. If you have been looking forward to getting your apps running on 64-bit, or if you need to update to the latest version of the NDK, hit the developer portal to get your download started.\n\nDeveloping with the x86_64 Android NDK\n\nThe Native Development Kit (NDK) is a toolset that allows you to implement parts of your app using native code languages such as C and C++. For certain types of apps, this can be helpful so you can reuse existing code libraries written in these languages, but most apps do not need the Android NDK. You need to balance the benefits of using the NDK against its drawbacks. Notably, using native code on Android generally does not result in a noticeable performance improvement, but it always increases your app complexity. You should only use the NDK if it is essential to your app and not because you simply prefer to program in C/C++.\n\nYou can download the latest version of Android NDK from: https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html\n\nIn this section I'll review how to compile a sample application using the Android NDK.\n\nWe will use the sample application, san-angeles, located in the Android NDK samples directory: $ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles\n\nNative code is located in the jni/ directory:\n\n$ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles/jni\n\nNative code is compiled for specified CPU architecture(s). Android applications may contain libraries for several architectures in one apk file.\n\nTo set target architectures you need to create the Application.mk file inside the jni/ directory. The following line will compile the native libraries for all supported architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := all\n\nSometimes, it's better to specify a list of target architectures. This line compiles the libraries for x86 and ARM architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := x86 armeabi armeabi-v7a\n\nBecause we are building a 64-bit app, we need to compile the libraries for x86_64 architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := x86_64\n\nRun the following command inside the sample directory to build libraries:\n\ncd $ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles\n\nAfter the successful build, open the sample in Eclipse* as an Android application and click \"Run\". Select the emulator or a connected Android device where you want to run the application.\n\nTo support all available devices you need to compile the application for all architectures. If the apk file size with libraries for all architectures is too big, consider following the instructions in Google Play Multiple APK Support to prepare a separate apk file for each platform.\n\nChecking supported architectures\n\nYou can use this command to check what architectures are included in apk file:\n\naapt dump badging file.apk\n\nThe following line lists all architectures:\n\nnative-code: 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86', 'x86_64'\n\nAnother method is to open the apk file as a zip file and view subdirectories in the lib/ directory.\n\nOptimization of 64-bit programs Reducing the amount of memory an app consumes\n\nWhen a program is compiled in the 64-bit mode, it consumes more memory than its 32-bit version. This increase often goes unnoticed, but memory consumption can sometimes be two times higher than 32-bit apps. The amount of memory consumption is determined by the following factors:\n\nSome objects, like pointers, require larger amounts of memory Data alignment and data structure padding Increased stack memory consumption\n\n64-bit systems have a larger amount of memory available to user applications than 32-bit systems. So if a program takes 300 Mbytes on a 32-bit system with 2 Gbytes of memory but needs 400 Mbytes on a 64-bit system with 8 Gbytes of memory, in relative units, the program takes three times less memory on a 64-bit system. The one disadvantage is performance loss. Although 64-bit programs are faster, extracting larger amounts of data from memory might cancel all the advantages and even reduce performance. Transferring data between the memory and microprocessor (cache) is not very cheap.\n\nOne way to reduce memory consumption is to optimize data structures. Another way is to use memory-saving data types. For instance, if we need to store a lot of integer numbers and we know that their values will never exceed UINT_MAX, we may use the type \"unsigned\" instead of \"size t\", as discussed in the next section.\n\nUsing memsize-types in address arithmetic\n\nUsing ptrdiff_t and size_t types in address arithmetic might give you an additional performance gain along with making the code safer. For example, using the type int, whose size differs from the pointer's capacity, as an index results in additional data conversion commands in the binary code. We might have 64-bit code and the pointers' size is 64 bits while the size of int type remains the same - 32 bits.\n\nIt is not easy to give a brief example to show that size_t is better than unsigned. To be impartial, we have to use the compiler's optimizing capabilities. But two variants of the optimized code often get too different to easily demonstrate their difference. We managed to create something like a simple example after six tries. But the sample is far from ideal because instead of the code containing the unnecessary conversions of data types discussed above, it shows that the compiler can build a more efficient code when using size_t. Consider this code, which arranges array items in the reverse order:\n\n<code1.txt> unsigned arraySize; ... for (unsigned i = 0; i < arraySize / 2; i++) { float value = array[i]; array[i] = array[arraySize - i - 1]; array[arraySize - i - 1] = value; }\n\nThe variables \"arraySize\" and \"i\" in the example have the type unsigned. You can easily replace it with size_t and compare a small fragment of assembler code shown in Table 1.\n\narray [arraySize - I - 1] = value;\n\narraySize, i : unsigned\n\narraySize, i : size_t\n\nmov eax, DWORD PTR arraySize$[rsp]\n\nsub eax, r11d\n\nsub r11d, 1\n\nadd eax, -1\n\nmovss DWORD PTR [rbp + rax*4], xmm0\n\n...\n\nmov rax, QWORD PTR arraySize$[rsp]\n\nsub rax, r11\n\nadd r11, 1\n\nmovss DWORD PTR [rdi + rax*4 - 4], xmm0\n\n...\n\nTable 1 - Comparing the 64-bit assembler code fragments using the types unsigned and size_t\n\nThe compiler managed to build a more concise code when using 64-bit registers. We do not want to say that the code created using the type unsigned (column 1) will be slower than the code using the type size_t (column 2). It is difficult to compare the speed of code execution on contemporary processors. But you can see in this example that the compiler built a briefer and faster code when using 64-bit types.\n\nNow let us consider an example showing the advantages of the types ptrdiff_t and size_t from the viewpoint of performance. For the purposes of demonstration, we will take a simple algorithm of calculating the minimum path length.\n\nThe function FindMinPath32 is written in classic 32-bit style with unsigned types. The function FindMinPath64 differs from it only in the way that all the unsigned types in it are replaced with size_t types. There are no other differences! Now let us compare the execution speeds of these two functions (Table 2).\n\nMode and function Function's execution time 1 32-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath32 1 2 32-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath64 1.002 3 64-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath32 0.93 4 64-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath64 0.85 Table 2 - The time of executing the functions FindMinPath32 and FindMinPath64\n\nTable 2 shows reduced time relative to the speed of execution of the function FindMinPath32 on a 32-bit system. This table was developed for the purpose of clarity. The operation time of the\n\nFindMinPath32 function in the first line is 1 on a 32-bit system. This represents our baseline as a unit of measurement.\n\nIn the second line, we see that the operation time of the FindMinPath64 function is also 1 on a 32-bit system. No wonder, because the type unsigned coincides with the type size_t on a 32-bit system, and there is no difference between the FindMinPath32 and FindMinPath64 functions. A small deviation (1.002) only indicates a small error in measurements.\n\nIn the third line, we see a performance gain of 7%. We could well expect this result after recompiling the code for a 64-bit system.\n\nThe fourth line is of the most interest for us. The performance gain is 15%. By merely using the type size_t instead of unsigned, the compiler built a more effective code that works even 8% faster!\n\nThis simple and obvious example shows how data that are not equal to the size of the machine word slow down algorithm performance. Mere replacement of the types int and unsigned with ptrdiff_t and size_t may result in a significant performance gain. This result applies first of all to those cases where these data types are used in index arrays, in address arithmetic and to arrange loops.\n\nIntrinsic functions\n\nIntrinsic functions are special system-dependent functions that perform actions that cannot be performed at the C/C++ level of code or that perform these functions much more effectively. Actually, they let you get rid of inline assembler code because it is often undesirable or impossible to use.\n\nPrograms may use intrinsic functions to create faster code due to the lack of overhead expenses on calling common functions. The code size is a bit larger of course. MSDN gives a list of functions that can be replaced with their intrinsic versions. Examples of these are memcpy, strcmp, etc.\n\nBesides automatic replacement of common functions with their intrinsic versions, you may use intrinsic functions explicitly in your code. This might be helpful due to these factors:\n\nInline assembler is not supported by the Visual C++ compiler in the 64-bit mode while intrinsic code is. Intrinsic functions are simpler to use as they do not require knowledge of registers and other similar low-level constructs. Intrinsic functions are updated in compilers while assembler code must be updated manually. The built-in optimizer does not work with assembler code. Intrinsic code is easier to port than assembler code.\n\nUsing intrinsic functions in automatic mode (with the help of the compiler switch) will let you get some percentage of performance gain and using the \"manual\" switch helps even more. That is why using intrinsic functions is a good way to go.\n\nAlignment\n\nData structure alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. It consists of two separate but related issues: data alignment and data structure padding. When a modern computer reads from or writes to a memory address, it will do this in word-sized chunks (e.g., 4-byte chunks on 32-bit systems) or larger. Data alignment means putting the data at a memory offset equal to some multiple of the word size, which increases the system's performance due to the way the CPU handles memory. To align the data, it may be necessary to insert some meaningless bytes between the end of the last data structure and the start of the next, which is data structure padding.\n\nFor example, when the computer's word size is 4 bytes (which is 8 bits on most machines, but could be different on some systems), the data to be read should be at a memory offset that is some multiple of 4. When this is not the case, e.g., the data starts at the 14th byte instead of the 16th byte, then the computer has to read two 4-byte chunks and do some calculation before the requested data has been read, or it may generate an alignment fault. Even though the previous data structure ends at the 13th byte, the next data structure should start at the 16th byte. Two padding bytes are inserted between the two data structures to align the next data structure to the 16th byte.\n\nAlthough data structure alignment is a fundamental issue for all modern computers, many computer languages and computer language implementations handle data alignment automatically\n\nIt is good in some cases to help the compiler by defining the alignment manually to enhance performance. For example, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) data must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary. You may do this in the following way:\n\n// 16-byte aligned data __declspec(align(16)) double init_val[2] = {3.14, 3.14}; // SSE2 movapd instruction _m128d vector_var = __mm_load_pd(init_val); Android Runtime\n\nAndroid Runtime (ART) applications were developed by Google as a replacement of Dalvik. This runtime offers a number of new features that improve performance and smoothness of the Android platform and apps. ART was introduced in Android 4.4 KitKat; in Android 5.0 it will completely replace Dalvik. Unlike Dalvik, ART uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler (at runtime), meaning that ART compiles an application during its installation. As a result, the program executes faster and that improves battery life.\n\nFor backward compatibility, ART uses the same byte code as Dalvik.\n\nIn addition to the potential speed increase, using ART can provide a second important benefit. As ART runs app machine code directly (native execution), it doesn't hit the CPU as hard as just-in-time code compiling on Dalvik. Less CPU usage results in less battery drain, which is a big plus for portable devices in general.\n\nSo why wasn't ART implemented earlier? Let's look at the downsides of Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. First, the generated machine code requires more space than the existing byte code. Second, the code is pre-compiled at install time, so the installation process takes a bit longer time. Finally, it also corresponds to a larger memory footprint at execution time. This means that fewer apps can be run concurrently. When the first Android devices hit the market, memory and storage capacity were significantly smaller and presented a bottleneck for performance. This is the reason why a JIT approach was the preferred option at that time. Today, memory is much cheaper and thus more abundant, even on low-end devices, so ART is a logical step forward.\n\nIn perhaps the most important improvement, ART now compiles your application to native machine code when installed on a user's device. Known as ahead-of-time compilation, you can expect to see large performance gains as the compilers are set for specific architectures (such as ARM, x86, or MIPS). This eliminates the need for just-in-time compilation each time an application is run. Thus it takes more time to install your application, but it will boot faster when launched as many tasks executed at runtime on the Dalvik VM, such as class and method verification, have already taken place.\n\nNext, the ART team worked to optimize the garbage collector (GC). Instead of two pauses totaling about 10ms for each GC in Dalvik, you'll see just one, usually under 2ms. They've also parallelized portions of the GC runs and optimized collection strategies to be aware of device states. For example, a full GC will run only when the phone is locked and responsiveness to user interaction is no longer important. This is a huge improvement for applications that are sensitive to dropping frames. Additionally, future versions of ART will include a compact collector that will move chunks of allocated memory into contiguous blocks to reduce fragmentation and the need to kill older applications to allocate large memory regions.\n\nLastly, ART makes use of an entirely new memory allocator called Rosalloc (runs of slots allocator). Most modern systems use allocators based on Doug Lea's design, which has a single global memory lock. In a multithreaded, object-oriented environment, this interferes with the garbage collector and other memory operations. In Rosalloc, smaller objects common in Java are allocated in a thread-local region without locking and larger objects have their own locks. Thus when your application attempts to allocate memory for a new object, it doesn't have to wait while the garbage collector frees an unrelated region of memory.\n\nCurrently, Dalvik is the default runtime for Android devices and ART is optionally available on a number of Android 4.4 devices, such as Nexus phones, Google Play edition devices, Motorola phones running stock Android, and many other smartphones. ART is currently in development, and seeking developer and user feedback. ART will eventually replace Dalvik runtime once it becomes completely stable. Until then, users with compatible devices can switch from Dalvik to ART if they're interested in trying out this new functionality and experience its performance.\n\nTo switch or enable ART, your device must be running Android 4.4 KitKat and be compatible with ART. You can easily turn on ART runtime from \"Settings\" -> \"Developer options\" -> \"Runtime option\". (Tip: If you can't see Developer options in Settings, then go to \"About phone\", scroll down, and tap the Build number 7 times to enable developer options.) The phone will reboot and start optimizing the apps for ART, which can take around 15-20 minutes, depending on the number of apps installed on your phone. You will also notice an increase in the size of installed apps after enabling ART runtime.\n\nNote: After switching to ART, when you reboot your device for the first time, it will optimize all the apps once again; which is kind of annoying.\n\nAs Dalvik is the default runtime on Android devices, some apps might not work on ART, though, most existing apps are compatible with ART and should work fine. But in case you experience any bugs or app crashes with ART, then it's wise to switch back and stay with ART.\n\nSwitching to ART on devices requires you to know where to find the switching option on the device. Google has hidden it under Settings. Fortunately, there is a trick to enable ART runtime on device that are based on Android 4.4 KitKat.\n\nDisclaimer: Before trying this, you should make a backup of your data. Intel won't be responsible if your device gets bricked (won't turn on regardless of what you try). Try it at your own risk!\n\nRequires Root Don't try if you have WSM Tools installed as they don't support ART.\n\nTo enable ART, carefully follow these steps:\n\nMake sure your device is rooted. Install 'ES File Explorer' from the Play store. Open ES File Explorer, tap the menu icon from top left corner and select Tools. In tools, enable the 'Root Explorer' option and grant full root access to ES explorer when prompted. In ES explorer, open the Device (/) directory from Menu -> Local-> Device. Go to the /data/property folder. Open the persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file as Text and then select ES note editor. Edit the file by selecting the edit option from top right corner. Rename the line from libdvm.so to libart.so Go back to the persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file and select 'Yes' to save the file. Then reboot the phone. The phone will reboot now and start optimizing the apps for ART. It can take time to reboot depending on the number of apps installed on your device.\n\nIn case you want to revert back to Dalvik runtime, simply follow the above steps and rename the text in persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file to libdvm.so.\n\nConclusion\n\nGoogle has released a 64-bit emulator image for the forthcoming Android L - but only for the Intel x86 chip. The new emulator will allow developers to build or optimize older apps for the upcoming Android L OS and its new 64-bit architecture. Moving to 64-bit increases the addressable memory space, and allows a larger number of registers and a new instructions set for developers, but 64-bit apps aren't necessarily faster.\n\nJava apps automatically gain the benefits of 64-bit because their byte code will be interpreted by the new ART VM which is 64-bit.This also implies that no changes to pure Java apps are necessary. Those built on the Android NDK will need some optimization to include the x86_64 build target. Intel has advice on how to go about porting code that targets ARM to x86/x64. Using the new emulator, developers will only be able to create apps for Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 processor-based chips.\n\nIntel has been providing developers with tools and good system support for Android particularly its Intel\u00ae Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel\u00ae HAXM) and a range of Intel Atom OS images. Many Android programmers regularly test on emulated Intel architecture even though most of their deployment is to ARM devices. As well as the new emulator there is a 64-bit upgrade to the HAXM accelerator which should make using HAXM even more attractive. To quote Intel:\n\n\"This commitment is evident not only in the delivery of the industry's first 64-bit emulator image for Intel architecture, and 64-bit Intel HAXM within the Android L Developer Preview SDK, but also in many other innovations along the way such as the first 64-bit kernel for Android KitKat earlier this year, the 64-bit Android Native Development Kit (NDK), and other 64-bit advancements over the last decade.\"\n\nCould it be that a change to Intel architecture might happen as part of the change from 32-bit mobile to 64-bit mobile?\n\nThe Android SDK includes a virtual mobile device emulator that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you prototype, develop, and test Android applications without using a physical device. The Android emulator mimics all of the hardware and software features of a typical mobile device, except that it cannot place actual phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys, which you can \"press\" using your mouse or keyboard to generate events for your application. It also provides a screen in which your application is displayed, along with any other active Android applications.\n\nTo let you model and test your application more easily, the emulator utilizes Android Virtual Device (AVD) configurations. AVDs let you define certain hardware aspects of your emulated phone and allow you to create many configurations to test many Android platforms and hardware permutations. Once your application is running on the emulator, it can use the services of the Android platform to invoke other applications, access the network, play audio and video, store and retrieve data, notify the user, and render graphical transitions and themes.\n\nRelated Articles and Resources Get information and download Android NDK, Revision 10d here.

Therefore, these types of option strategies are considered appropriate for sophisticated traders with proper risk management and discipline due to the limitless losses.\n\nSelling calls is typically done against existing stock holdings in an attempt to create income from the position by capturing premium. For example, assume that a trader owns 1,000 shares of Apple Inc., which is trading at $125. The trader sells 10 calls at a strike price of $150 for $2. Each option contract represents 100 shares, so the sale nets the trader $2,000.\n\nEssentially, if Apple climbs above $150, the trader must sell his position or buy back the options. If Apple does not climb above that level by the option's expiration date, he can hold onto his shares and pocket the premium. Owning the shares takes the risk away from this strategy.\n\nIn the case of naked selling of call options, the risk is theoretically unlimited. Suppose a trader sells calls on a company that is trading for $10. He believes the upside is limited for the company and sells 100 calls at a strike price of $15 for $1. From this sale, he collects $10,000.\n\nIt turns out that the trader's judgement is incorrect, and a competitor buys out the stock for $50. All of a sudden, the call options that the trader is short climbs to $35, even though he sold them for $1. His $10,000 profit would turn into a $350,000 loss. This example illustrates the dangers of naked selling call options.\n\nNaked selling of put options can be quite dangerous in the event of a steep fall in the price of a stock. The option seller is forced to buy the stock at a certain price. However, the lowest the stock can drop to is zero, so there is a floor to the losses. In the case of call options, there is no limit to how high a stock can climb, meaning that potential losses are limitless.", "SYDNEY - Early adopters of the Apple Watch, Apple Inc's first new product in five years, are complaining that a number of its key functions are disrupted by their tattoos.\n\nOwners of Apple Watch - including this reporter, who bought a 42 mm version with stainless steel case and black classic buckle for A$1,029 ($979) - have found that their inked skin confuses the sensors on the underside of the device.\n\nUsers of the watch, which went on sale last week, took to social media on Thursday under the hashtag #tattoogate to air their frustration with the flaw from Apple's renowned design house.\n\nOne anonymous user on Reddit, an entertainment, social networking, and user-generated news website, said the device's locking mechanism, which should disengage when the watch detects it is being worn, failed to work on decorated skin.\n\n\"My hand isn't tattooed and the Watch stayed unlocked.

The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Taipei-based technology analyst, who is in regular contact with AAC, said he was not aware of the tattoo problem, but did not expect it would have a significant impact on production.\n\n\"We have been hearing suppliers encountering some bottleneck issues for Apple Watch's production such as problems with its displays, haptics or assembly,\" he told Reuters, adding that those issues were quite common for new products.", "SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, executive vice president Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nFollow live coverage of Microsoft's Build conference below. Mobile users click here.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3% of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung, control 81% of the market and Apple 15%, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said.", "Apple Inc limited availability of the Apple Watch after a key component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe component, called the taptic engine, produces the sensation of being tapped on the wrist, the newspaper reported.\n\nApple declined to comment on the story.\n\nApple has not given any sales figures for its hotly anticipated Apple Watch since it began taking orders this month. Chief executive Tim Cook said on Monday that demand continued to outstrip supply.\n\nSome taptic engines supplied by Shenzhen, China-based AAC Technologies Holdings Inc started to break down over time, the Journal said, citing the people. The company is one of two suppliers of these components to Apple, it said.\n\nAs a result, Apple is now sourcing nearly all of its components from the other supplier, Japan's Nidec Corp. It may take time for the company to increase production, the people told the Journal.\n\nThe Journal said an AAC spokeswoman declined to comment about the company's customers. Reuters was unable to reach the company for comment outside of regular business hours in China.\n\nNidec was not immediately available for comment.

There will be no impact to the electrical grid in Japan,\" Musk said in the interview.\n\n(Reporting By Manya Venkatesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "India woke up to telecommunications through the reforms of the late 1990s: the power of DOT was curtailed, VSNL was privatised, private and foreign companies were permitted, new methods of working were permitted. At the time, wired lines were mainstream and wireless communications was novel. However, setting up wire lines in India is very hard. India leapfrogged, and jumped into the mobile revolution for both voice and data. The concept of not having a land line at home was exotic in the US when it was normal in India. In similar fashion, India was an early adopter of electronic order matching for financial trading, and of second generation pension reforms: these things became mainstream in the world after they were done in India.\n\nCould similar leapfrogging take place in the field of electricity? An important milestone in this story will come about with the announcement by Tesla Motors on Thursday the 30th of April, 2015.\n\nElectricity consumption fluctuates quite a bit within the day. More electricity is purchased when establishments are open (i.e. daytime), when it's too hot or too cold, and when humans are awake in the dark. The electricity system has to adjust its production to ensure that instantaneous consumption equals instantaneous generation.\n\nIf producers are inflexible and consumers are inflexible then generation will not equal consumption. The puzzle lies in creating mechanisms through which both sides adjust to the problems of the other in a way that minimises costs at a system level.\n\nFor producers, it is not easy to continually modify production to cater to changing demand. The two most important technologies -- coal and nuclear -- are most efficient in large scale plants which run round the clock. It may take as much as a day to switch off, or switch on, a plant. These plants are used to produce the 'base load': the amount of electricity that is required in the deep of the night. Other technologies and modified plant designs are required to achieve flexibility of production within the day. This flexibility comes at a cost. Suppose the lowest demand of the day is L and the highest is H. For the electricity system as a whole, a given level of average production is costlier when H/L is higher. The cheapest electricity system is one where H/L=1; this runs base load all the time.\n\nMatters have been made more complicated by renewables. Solar energy is only available when it's light, while peak demand of the day is generally in the late evening. Electricity generation from windmills is variable. Further, the planning and despatch management of the grid is made complicated when there is small scale production taking place at thousands of locations, as opposed to the few big generation plants of the old days.\n\nThere are thus a large number of decisions: how to produce, how much to produce and when, how much to consume and when. Economic efficiency is achieved by putting a market in between buyers and sellers, where the price of spot electricity continuously fluctuates. The electricity industry, organised around this price, becomes a self-organising system where a large number of players make uncoordinated decisions about how much and when to consume, how to produce, and how much and when to produce. The price in this market is the summary statistic of 'the problem of electricity, worldwide' as articulated above. Here's an example (source) of the key patterns, from PJM Interconnect, the biggest power market of the world:\n\nFrom the viewpoint of both consumers and producers, these massive price fluctuations beg the question: How can we do things differently in order to fare better? The question for consumers is: How can purchase of electricity from the grid be moved from peak time to off-peak time? The question for producers is: How can more production be achieved at peak time?\n\nAll this is true of electricity worldwide. Turning to India, there are two key differences.\n\nThe first issue is that ubiquitous and reliable electricity from the grid has not been achieved. The mains power supply in India is unreliable. The euphemism 'intermittent supply' is used in describing the electricity supplied by the grid in India. Households and firms are incurring significant expenses in dealing with intermittent supply . Intermittent power imposes costs including batteries, inverters, down time, burned out equipment, diesel generators, diesel, etc. Diesel generation seems to come at a cost of $0.45/kWh. When power can be purchased from the grid, it isn't cheap, as a few buyers are cross-subsidising many others.\n\nIn large parts of India, the grid has just not been built out. There are numerous places where it would be very costly to scale out the conventional grid. There are places in India where calculations show that a large diesel generator in a village has strengths over the centralised system. There are small towns in Uttar Pradesh where private persons have illegally installed large generators and are selling electricity through the (non-functioning) grid, in connivance with the local utility staff.\n\nGlobal discussions of energy systems talk about base load and peak load. In India, the existing generation capacity is not adequate even at base load! The apparent H/L in the data is wrong; demand at the peak is much greater than H -- we just get power cuts. Every little addition to capacity helps. There has been a large scale policy failure on the main energy system. Perhaps more decentralised solutions can help solve problems by being more immune to the mistakes of policy makers.\n\nThe second interesting difference is high insolation with high predictability of sunlight.\n\nNote that the deep blue for the European map is 800 kWh/m2 while for the Indian map, the same deep blue is 1250 kWh/m2. Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim get more sunlight than Scotland.\n\nSubstantial technological progress is taking place in wind and in solar photovoltaics (SPV).\n\nWind energy is enjoying incremental gains through maturation of engineering, and also the gains from real time reconfiguration of systems using cheap CPUs and statistical analysis of historical data from sensors.\n\nThe price of crystalline silicon PV cells has dropped from $77/watt in 1977 to $0.77/watt in 2013: this is a decline at 13% per year, or a halving each 5 years, for 36 years. This is giving a huge surge in installed capacity (albeit a highly subsidised surge in most places).\n\nFor decades, renewables have been a part of science fiction. Now, for the first time, massive scale renewable generation has started happening. The present pace of installation is, indeed, the child of subsidy programs, but the calculations now yield reasonable values even without subsidies. If and when the world gets going with some kind of carbon taxation, that will generate a new government-induced push in favour of renewables, which could replace the existing subsidies in terms of reshaping incentives.\n\nElectricity generation using renewables is variable (wind) or peaks at the wrong times (solar). In addition, wind and solar production is naturally distributed; it is not amenable to a single 100 acre facility that makes 2000 MW. These problems hamper the use of renewables in the traditional centralised grid architecture. These problems would be solved if only we could have distributed storage.\n\nWhat would a world with low cost storage look like? Imagine a group of houses who put PV on their roofs and run one or two small windmills. Imagine that these sources feed a local storage system. The renewable generation would take place all through the day. When electricity prices on the grid are at their intra-day peak, electricity would be drawn from the storage system.\n\nFor the centralised system, the cost of delivering electricity at a certain (x,y,t) can be quite high: perhaps households at certain (x,y,t) can sell electricity back to the grid.\n\nThis is the best of all worlds for everyone. The grid would get a reduced H/L ratio and would be able to do what the grid does best -- highly efficient large-scale base load technologies. The grid would be able to deliver electricity to remote customers at lower cost. Consumers would be better off, as payments for expensive peak load electricity would be reduced.\n\nThis scenario requires low cost storage. For many years, we were stuck on the problem of storage. In recent years, important breakthroughs have come in scaling up lithium-ion batteries, which were traditionally very expensive and only used in portable electronics. Lithium Ion batteries have 2.3 times the storage per unit volume, and 3.1 times the storage per unit mass, when compared with the lead acid batteries being used with inverters in India today.\n\nTesla Motors is an American car company. They have established a very large scale contract with Panasonic to buy Lithium Ion batteries. Nobody quite knows, but their internal cost for Lithium Ion batteries is estimated to be between $200/kWh and $400/kWh. On Thursday (30 April 2015), they are likely to announce a 10 kWh battery for use in homes. It's cost is likely to between $2000 and $4000 for the battery part, yielding a somewhat higher price as there will also be a non-battery part. (It is not yet certain that the part they announce will be 10 kWh. There are many stories which suggest this will cost $13,000, which are likely to be wrong).\n\nA 10 kWh battery can run for 10 hours at a load of 1000 Watts. Note that Tesla is only pushing innovations in manufacturing; they are not improving battery technology. Many others are on the chase for better battery technology.\n\nStupendous progress has happened with batteries in the last 20 years. Only two years ago, this price/performance was quite out of reach. It is a whole new game, to get a Lithium-Ion battery at between $200 to $400 per kWh. Suddenly, all sorts of design possibilities open up. Further, this is only the beginning.\n\nExperts in this field in the US believe that when Lithium Ion batteries are below $150/kWh, they will be fully ready for applications in the electricity industry in the US. These experts believe this number will be reached in 5 to 10 years.\n\nThe rise of storage links up to the rise of electric cars in two ways. First, electric cars are driving up demand for lithium-ion batteries and giving economies of scale in that industry. Second, a home which has an electric car has that battery! The present technology in electric cars -- Tesla's Model S -- has a 85 kWh battery, which is good capacity when compared with the requirements of a home.\n\nRenewables have generated excitement among science geeks for a long time, but have disappointed in terms of their real world impact. Scientific progress in renewables, and in batteries, are coming together to the point of real world impact.\n\nStorage is one method for coping with the intermittent generation from renewables. The other method is to make demand more flexible. As an example, a smart water heater or a smart air conditioner could do more when electricity is cheap, and vice versa. This would make consumption more price elastic.\n\nThe Indian environment with expensive and intermittent electricity from the grid is an ideal environment for renewables + batteries.\n\nDistributed generation and distributed storage are seen as ambitious cutting edge technology in (say) Germany. Perhaps the natural use case for this is in India. In Germany, the grid works -- there is no problem with achieving high availability. In Germany, there isn't that much sun. In India, every customer of electricity suffers increased costs in getting up to high availability, and there is plentiful sunlight.\n\nA weird thing that we do in India is to charge high prices for the biggest customers of electricity. For these customers, roof-top PV systems are already cheaper. Problems in the fuel supply have given a steep rise in base load prices, and have pushed the shift to renewables.\n\nIn the US, the cost of power varies between 7 and 20 cents/kWh. In this environment, grid parity requires that Lithium Ion batteries achieve $150/kWh. In India, the break even point is much higher. The announcement on Thursday may yield a price that is viable for many applications in India.\n\nAt a campus scale in India, a small electricity system could be constructed with the following elements:\n\n- There are a few windmills. Large-scale adoption would require windmill designs which cater to aesthetic sense and not just technical efficiency.\n\n- It would make sense to add one diesel generator into the mix, with the advantage that it would run at top efficiency as it would only be used to feed the battery. (This is similar to the efficiencies of running the engine in a hybrid car).\n\n- The campus would buy electricity from the grid when it's available and when it's cheap, and use this to charge the battery.\n\n- Electricity from the grid, the renewables and the disel generator would feed the battery.\n\n- All consumption would happen from the battery. Users inside the campus would experience 100% uptime.\n\n- Electric cars and motorcycles could augment the battery capacity at the campus scale.\n\n- Cheap CPUs would give the intelligence required to seamlessly orchestrate this system, in real time, all the time.\n\nAs an example, the picture below is a pretty windmill, 3m diameter and 5m high, which has a nameplate rating of 6500 watts. The output would vary with the wind, but under normal circumstances in India, we might get average production of 1500 watts from this.\n\nA large number of installations of this nature would change the elasticity of demand for electricity. When there is peaking load, and the price of electricity is high, these installations would switch to using their batteries. This would reduce the H/L ratio and thus bring down the capital cost of the centralised electricity system.\n\nA related development is taking place with rural mobile towers in India. These must grapple with the problem of intermittent electricity, and are starting to do distributed electricity generation for surrounding households. They are also pushing into new storage technologies.\n\nScenario 1 is where all this happens. For this, five things have to happen:\n\n- Higher oil prices, ideally a carbon tax worldwide.\n\n- In industrial countries: continued government support for R&D and adoption of renewables and electric cars.\n\n- Continued worldwide scientific progress with batteries.\n\n- Sustained low interest rates, globally, for a long time.\n\n- Electricity policy in India which gives time-of-day pricing all the way to each household, and sets up an API through which a CPU at the household can query the price. Ideally, a mechanism for distributed producers to sell back to the grid at a cost which reflects the cost faced by the grid in delivering electricity at that location\n\nIf these five things happen, then we're pretty much on our way to a new world of distributed generation and distributed storage, in India and in the world outside.\n\nOne interesting consequence of this scenario would be a sustained decline in crude oil prices. This would finally yield the outcome envisaged by Sheik Zaki Yamani who said in 1973: The stone age did not end because the world ran out of stones.\n\nScenario 2: This shapes up as a mainstream technology for difficult areas only\n\nIn an alternative scenario, these five things do not quite work out okay, and distributed generation + distributed storage do not shape up as the mainstream technology for every day use in the first world. However, this could still be compatible with the possibility that these are good technologies for a place like India where grid supply is untrusted and there is plenty of sunlight.\n\nThe malleability of a late starter. In the US, where the grid is well established, these new developments threaten the business model of the existing electricity industry where vast investments are already in place. In India, high availability grid power has not yet come about; the grid is far from meeting the requirements of the people. Hence, there is greater malleability and an opportunity to change course, in a direction that favours decentralisation and reduced carbon.\n\nDisrupting a broken system. If a lot of buyers in India defect from the excessive prices charged by the grid (owing to the cross subsidisation and theft), this will generate financial difficulties for the grid. As an example, see this submission in Maharashtra by the Prayas, Energy Group, and their response on the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act.\n\nAllocative decisions for the capital that goes into distributed energy. On the scale of the country, capital would shift from centralised production of electricity to distributed production + distributed storage. In the Indian public policy environment, it's always better to have self-interested households and firms making distributed choices about capital expenditures, rather than capital being placed in the hands of regulated firms.\n\nIndustrial policy is not required. This article is not a call for industrial policy. We don't need to launch subsidy programs, or force car manufacturers to switch to electric, or force mobile phone towers to switch to renewables, etc. The Indian State has poor capacity on thinking and executing industrial policy. As a general principle, in public policy thinking in India, it's best to eschew industrial policy or planning, and just focus on getting the basics right.\n\nNo industrial policy was required in getting to the ubiquitous water tanks on every roof in India -- it came from private choices responding to the failures of public policy on water. The invisible hand is amply at work. Indian car manufacturers exported 542,000 cars in 2014-15. Hence, these firms have ample incentive to figure out electric cars. Unreliable and expensive electricity is giving ample incentive to customers to find better solutions. Indian software services and IT product companies have ample incentive to tune into this space, and build the software end of this emerging global environment. New technological possibilities will be rapidly taken up.\n\nIndia should fix the grid. There are major economies of scale in making centralised electricity generation work. But we should see that we are coming at this from the opposite direction. In the West, we start from 100% centralised energy and will perhaps head towards 66% centralised energy. We in India may first overshoot to 40% centralised energy and then go up to 66% centralised energy through gradual improvements in public policy on centralised electricity.\n\nCompare and contrast this with how we see water tanks on roofs. These water tanks are the physical manifestation of the failure of public policy in the field of water. When sound water utilities come up, they will do centralised production of 24 hour water pressure, and the water tanks will go away.\n\nOn one hand, the failures of public policy on electricity in India are exactly like the failures of public policy in water in India. Once it becomes possible to opt out of public systems to a greater extent, with generation and storage under the control of a campus, people will take to this. This will overshoot, going beyond what's technically sound. In the long run, when the policy frameworks on electricity become better, the share of centralised energy will go up. But there is good sense in distributed energy and it's not just a coping strategy. Even deep in the future, when policy failures are absent, there's a big role for distributed energy while there is no role for distributed water storage.\n\nFor an analogy, the wireless revolution came first to Indian telecom. But now that this is established, we know that there laying fibre to the home is required in order to get good bandwidth. We will asymptotically endup converging on what's seen in the West, we'll just come at it from a different direction.\n\nIndia has yet to reap the efficiencies of centralised generation, transmission and distribution. We need to end subsidies and combat theft. This is the slow process of improving policy frameworks in electricity. The main point of this article is that along the difficult journey to this destination, we'll first have an upsurge of Sintex water tanks on roofs.\n\nSound pricing rules are required. From an Indian public policy point of view, the key action point required is that moment to moment, supply and demand should clear, the spot price should fluctuate, buyers of electricity should be fully exposed to these fluctuating prices, and the spot price at all points of time should be made visible to each buyer through an API. This is not insuperably difficult. Even the present bad arrangement -- unpredictable grid outage where the price goes to $infty$ -- is actually pushing private persons in the right direction.\n\nThe market failure: externalities. Knowledge spillovers benefit society at large, and self-interest favours under-investment in knowledge. In the face of this market failure (i.e. positive externalities), perhaps the government can fund a few research labs so as to grow skills in this emerging landscape. See Rangan Banerjee's article at page 38 of the December 2014 issue of Energy Next which talks about renewables R&D and manufacturing in India. It would help if there was a large number of pilot projects which aim to build towards campus-scale adoption, so as to have a precise sense of how well things work, solve local problems, and diffuse knowledge.\n\nThe gap in knowledge in India on batteries is large. But it is feasible for India to get into manufacturing power units, solar cells, etc. We need to study the steps taken by Japan and China to build up their capabilities in this field.\n\nThe importance of the cost of capital. Renewables involve high capital cost and near-zero running cost. The use case is critically about the cost of capital. Successful inflation targeting, and capital account openness, will give lower rates of return for equity and debt, which is required for the adoption of these technologies.\n\nThere is no market failure in energy conservation. When customers are given high prices of electricity, they have ample incentive to adopt energy-efficient technologies. India is in good shape on pricing in some areas (electricity, petrol) though not in some others (kerosene, LPG). Once the price of energy is correct, the next price that shapes adoption of energy efficient technology is the cost of capital. The failures of monetary policy and finance in India are giving a high cost of capital. Once these are solved, there is no market failure in the adoption of demand side innovations. Low interest rates and low required rates of return on equity will shift the private sector calculation in favour of energy efficient technology.\n\nIf this scenario unfolds as described in India, there will be a loss of momentum in centralised energy, and sharp growth in distributed production and storage of energy.", "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans a swing through Silicon Valley on Thursday, speaking with Stanford University experts about innovation, building relationships with tech firms and investors, and - as head of one of the world's leading car producing nations - popping in on electric carmaker Tesla Motors.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nAbe's California schedule includes a round-table with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and more.

Jerry Brown and a Fairmont Hotel dinner with local leaders and community members.", "In an announcement Thursday, Tesla is expected to give details about a new business based on the batteries that power its cars.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk thinks he can pave the way to a better energy future by turning the mattress-shaped batteries in Tesla's electric cars into upright pillars so they can power homes, businesses and even utilities.\n\nMusk will lift the veil Thursday on a new generation of batteries designed to store growing volumes of solar and wind energy. If he gets it right, Tesla Motors Inc. will have spun a significant second business off the technology originally designed for its electric vehicles -- and will gain a toehold in a business projected to generate tens of billions of dollars in a decade.\n\nNobody in the power industry has yet been able to come up with a cost-effective way to store large volumes of energy for later distribution. Tesla is making a bet that its huge $5 billion \"gigafactory\" currently under construction near Reno, Nevada, will enable the mass production needed to drive down the cost of batteries and make them competitive for a broad range of customers, including traditional electricity suppliers.\n\nTesla has scheduled an event Thursday at its design studio in Hawthorne, Calif., to announce both a Tesla home battery and what it called last week in a note to investors \"a very large utility scale battery.\"\n\n\"Whatever Tesla announces on Thursday is just the beginning,\" said Peter Rosegg, spokesman for Hawaiian Electric Co., where 12 per cent of the utility's customers have rooftop solar panels. \"Tesla doesn't have to go after the market -- the market will come to them. We're very eager to see what they have to say.\"\n\nTesla, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has its eye on a business that's poised for tremendous growth. As homes, businesses and utilities use more renewable energy generated by sun and wind, the need to provide for reliable power grows. Batteries can be used to store electricity during peak production times, and then dispense it later when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nMusk tweeted a teaser about their Thursday announcement: \"For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and (of course) . . . the missing piece,\" he posted on Twitter Tuesday.\n\nA January report from Navigant Research estimates that worldwide revenue from grid-scale energy storage could total more than $68 billion (U.S.) by 2024 as renewable resources multiply and electricity grid operators seek ways to balance their mix of generation assets.\n\nTesla is already supplying batteries to homes and commercial businesses such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. through pilot projects and a supply agreement with SolarCity Corp., a relationship that generated $2.7 million in revenue for Tesla in 2014, according to a recent regulatory filing.\n\nBut Tesla is thinking much bigger, saying in job postings that its energy-storage business will soon grow to billions in sales. Musk plans to combine the strengths of the company's patented lithium-ion batteries, which can run a car for about 426 kilometers per charge, with its expertise in power management software.\n\nMusk's green power ambitions involve three inter-connected enterprises: SolarCity, where he serves as chairman, the battery factory in Nevada, and the Tesla car business.

If he gets it right, Tesla Motors Inc. will have spun a significant second business off the technology originally designed for its electric vehicles -- and will gain a toehold in a business projected to generate tens of billions of dollars in a decade.\n\nNobody in the power industry has yet been able to come up with a cost-effective way to store large volumes of energy for later distribution. Tesla is making a bet that its huge $5 billion \"gigafactory\" currently under construction near Reno, Nevada, will enable the mass production needed to drive down the cost of batteries and make them competitive for a broad range of customers, including traditional suppliers of electricity.\n\nTesla has scheduled an event Thursday at its design studio in Hawthorne, California, to announce both a Tesla home battery and what it called last week in a note to investors \"a very large utility-scale battery.\"\n\nEagerly Awaiting\n\n\"Whatever Tesla announces on Thursday is just the beginning,\" said Peter Rosegg, spokesman for Hawaiian Electric Co., where 12 percent of the utility's customers have rooftop solar panels. \"Tesla doesn't have to go after the market -- the market will come to them. We're very eager to see what they have to say.\"\n\nTesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has its eye on a business that's poised for tremendous growth. As homes, businesses and utilities use more renewable energy generated by sunshine and wind, the need to provide reliable power grows. Batteries can be used to store electricity during peak production times, and then dispense it later when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nMusk tweeted a teaser about the Thursday announcement: \"For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and (of course) ... the missing piece,\" he posted on Twitter Tuesday. Tesla rose 0.9 percent to $232.45 at the close in New York.\n\nGlobal Growth\n\nA January report from Navigant Research estimates that worldwide revenue from grid-scale energy storage may exceed $68 billion by 2024 as renewable resources multiply and electricity grid operators seek to balance the mix of generation assets.\n\nTesla is already supplying batteries to homes and commercial businesses such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. through pilot projects and a supply agreement with SolarCity Corp., a relationship that generated $2.7 million in revenue for Tesla in 2014, according to a recent regulatory filing. That's less than 1/10 of 1 percent of the automaker's total for last year.\n\nBut Tesla is thinking much bigger, saying in job postings that its energy-storage business will soon grow to billions in sales. Musk plans to combine the strengths of the company's patented lithium-ion batteries, which currently can run a car for about 265 miles (426 kilometers) a charge, with its expertise in power management software.\n\nGreen Trio\n\nMusk's green power ambitions involve three inter-connected enterprises: SolarCity, where he serves as chairman, the battery factory in Nevada, and the Tesla car business. With the move into energy storage, Tesla can help green the grid that fuels its cars while offering solar customers a way to store any excess electricity in batteries for use during hours of less sunlight and greater demand.\n\nAn even larger potential market will be utilities that have traditionally generated power with coal and natural gas.\n\n\"Tesla isn't just going to sell batteries to SolarCity,\" said Ben Kallo, an analyst with Robert W.

The residential product isn't going to be a huge needle mover in the near term, but the numbers are very big on the utility side.\"\n\nTesla will face competition from other battery makers such as Korea's LG Chem Ltd., legacy U.S. power providers such as AES Corp. and startups such as JLM Energy Inc. It will have to navigate regulatory hurdles in a state-by-state market with varying degrees of subsidies and incentives for the technology.\n\nMoving Slowly\n\nUtilities, cautious by nature, have been slow to adopt storage on their own.\n\n\"Storage doesn't neatly fit into transmission, distribution or generation categories so it can be tough for utilities to justify investing in storage projects,\" said Brian Warshay, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \"Some utilities, like the California investor-owned companies, are getting into storage because their regulator basically told them they have to.\"\n\nIn Tesla's home state, a groundbreaking energy-storage mandate requires PG&E Corp., Edison International's Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric to collectively buy 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by the end of 2020. New York is also pushing utilities to use storage to relieve congestion on transmission lines and plans for the potential retirement of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. Entergy Corp., owner of Indian Point, is applying for a federal license to keep its reactors open through the end of the next decade.\n\nUtilities in California and New York are potential customers for Tesla.

The company has designed those batteries not for cars but for homes, businesses and utilities that want to either pair them with solar panels or install them alone to help manage their energy use or regulate the electric grid.\n\nTesla is entering a young energy storage market where polices and incentives are making it more economically feasible to sell battery systems to businesses and utilities so far. California is the first state in the country to require utilities to buy energy storage services, which range from banking solar electricity for later use to charging and discharging electricity from the grid to regulate its frequency or maintain a balance of supply and demand (or else there could be blackouts).\n\nSolarCity can't provide a photo of its battery system, so I'm showing a Honda electric Fit with a battery system and a Honda energy management system in the background.\n\nEngineering battery packs and their control software has been Tesla's core technology -- Daimler and Toyota have both used it. It's not surprising that Tesla is interested in expanding its reach beyond cars. The rise of the energy storage market is tied with the growth of the solar and wind power generation and a realization that batteries could also substitute fossil fuel power plants for some of the grid-regulating tasks. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, is the chairman of SolarCity, which according to GTM Research has the biggest share of the residential market and in 2014 installed the most megawatts for business customers.\n\nSo what are some of the challenges that Tesla faces as it seeks to build an energy storage business? Let's look at three of them:\n\n1. Running that big factory: Tesla is building a giant, $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory in Nevada with Panasonic. Tesla has become better at manufacturing cars at scale -- it struggled early on -- but managing a battery factory with a Japanese electronics giant will present new challenges. At gigawatt-scale, the factory will be much larger than Tesla's current battery pack manufacturing operation. Supersizing production requires managing more equipment and people, and that inevitably leads to more problems during the production ramp up. Tesla also will have to work more closely with Panasonic, which will not only be selling lithium-ion battery cells from its factory in Japan but also will be making the cells at the new Nevada factory.\n\nTesla doesn't expect to always make the same battery systems, and changing the battery technology will present new risks. It's designing battery cell manufacturing equipment for the new factory so that it could switch the materials, the battery's shape and the vendors who supply the components if it decides to change its battery system designs, according to its 2014 report. It currently uses the cylindrical cells that are commonly found in consumer electronics.\n\n2. Performance data: Tesla started selling batteries for homes in 2013 and for business and utility customers in 2014. We haven't heard sales figures, which aren't significant enough to impact the company's finances. Those batteries also haven't been in the field long enough to demonstrate their long-term performance. Certainly, Tesla has found room for improvement and is launching new designs during a media event tomorrow night. Musk mused about designing a \"cool\" battery pack for homes during an earnings call in May last year.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "If Tesla Motors thought a Maryland bill allowing direct automaker-to-customer sales would be legalized once the state's auto dealers association was on board, it was wrong. No, the California-based maker of the all-electric Model S faced a last-minute wrench into the state's lawmaking process, according to Green Car Reports. And it was General Motors.\n\nAs politicos were set to approve House Bill 235 for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's signature, GM stepped up to lobby against it. In fact, after wrangling for the number of state dealerships that would ultimately be allowed for Tesla (it ended up being four), the state passed the bill just six minutes before its deadline.\n\n\"While not specific to just Maryland, we also believe all industry participants should operate under the same rules and requirements on fundamental issues that govern how we sell, service and market our products,\" wrote GM spokeswoman Laura Toole in an email to AutoblogGreen. \"GM plans to compete in the all-electric vehicle market. By enacting HB 235, multiple manufacturers may compete with similarly capable vehicles and similar price points, yet they would operate under a distinctly different set of rules, which is why we opposed HB 235.\"\n\nRegardless, the bill did pass, and the state's governor is expected to sign it into law in May.\n\nRelated Video:", "First the numbers: global sales of electric vehicles - both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles - were at 288,500 units in 2014, about 40 per cent higher than 2013 levels, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance research. The total sales of hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius (without the plug-in facility) totalled 1.6 million units.\n\nThe big markets for electric vehicles are in the US, Europe, China and Japan. About 121,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US last year while the estimated sales in Europe were 100,000 units. Norway stands out in the region: over 13 per cent of passenger vehicle sales in 2014 were of the electric variety, the highest in Europe.\n\nIn China, the electric vehicle sector has been identified as a strategic emerging industry, which is to be promoted. Sales of electric vehicles in China exceeded 35,000 units in 2014 - some 247 per cent higher than the year before.\n\nThe battery that provides the juice for the electric vehicle is getting more attention as energy storage cost declines and technology progresses to offer interesting alternatives. These batteries have applications in the renewable energy sector too. Last year, Tesla Motors co-founder Elon Musk announced his intention to invest $5 billion to set up the world's largest battery factory in Nevada, which is slated to start production in 2016.

The so-called gigafactory is projected to shave 30 per cent off the cost of a lithium-ion battery. Japan's Panasonic is a partner.\n\nThe price of storage (lithium-ion) used in fully electric vehicles was about $500 a kWh last year. It was much higher for plug-in hybrid vehicles, at $825 a kWh. Besides technology companies, a number of universities are working on reducing the cost while increasing the efficiency of storage using different materials, such as molten metal and lithium-sulphur. We expect prices to continue to fall.\n\nThere are some car makers working on fuel-cell powered vehicles. Toyota started selling the \"Mirai\" fuel-cell car - it travels 300 miles with a hydrogen tank that can be refilled in less than five minutes - in Japan in December. These vehicles will require supporting hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. Musk has dismissed fuel cells as \"fool cells.\"\n\nCheaper storage vastly improves the business case for renewables. For an individual residential or commercial unit consumer, it also reduces the reliance on grid power, as stored power can be used when the sun is not shining on the rooftop solar panels, for instance. SolarCity, the rooftop solar installer also backed by Musk, is already offering rooftop systems with Tesla-made batteries.\n\nBYD, the Chinese car maker partially owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is one of the companies active in the storage products market. It expects to double deliveries of storage products this year amid rising global demand.\n\nThere are some countries that are mandating storage installations or at least incentivising them. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan, for instance, provides grants for energy storage applications. The South Korean government was considering the option of offering 5.5 times the agreed per-unit tariff for renewable energy, if it is delivered during peak hours. California wants to add 1.3 gigawatts of storage systems by 2020.\n\nThere isn't too much activity in the Indian electric car or storage market. The government has earmarked some Rs 75 crore in the current year for FAME - an acronym for faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles. There is also a target of putting five million electric and hybrid vehicles per year on the road by 2020 under a National Electric Mobility Mission Plan.\n\nTesla is reportedly keen to start selling in India, but the high import duty and lack of customer incentives present significant barriers. Mahindra & Mahindra, which owns the Reva brand of cars, projects electric vehicles to account for 2-5 per cent of the market in the next few years. The question is, how far should an energy deficit country promote electric vehicles?\n\nVandana Gombar is editor, global policy for Bloomberg New Energy Finance", "Exclusive: Ford Motor CFO Continues To See FY15 Profit 'Breakthrough'\n\nVisionary entrepreneur Elon Musk has never been one for mincing worlds. When Musk talks, the world tends to listen. And when Musk takes to Twitter to share his thoughts on developments at Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), the stock market tends to react.\n\nHere's a short list of times that Musk tweets have moved the stock market in recent months.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Musk tweeted the following cryptic message:\n\nTesla has sent out invitations to an event on Thursday night that references \"The Missing Piece,\" which is speculated to be a home battery pack.\n\nTesla shares have had a somewhat muted reaction to the tweet, trading up about 0.4 percent on a day where the Nasdaq has fallen more than 0.5 percent.\n\nLast night's tweet was not the first time that Musk has referenced Thursday night's event. The first tweet, from about a month ago, boosted Tesla shares by 4 percent.\n\nOn the Monday following Musk's Sunday tweet about eliminating range anxiety, Tesla shares climbed 3.7 percent.\n\nMusk's pre-release Twitter hype of the new all-wheel drive version of Tesla's Model S sedan drove Tesla's stock up 4.7 percent, forcing Musk to defend himself against criticism that he uses Twitter as a means of intentionally manipulating Tesla's share price.\n\nMusk's response to rumors that thousands of Tesla cars were being recalled over a potentially overheating power adapter drove Tesla shares higher by 16 percent, although the company's announcement that 4Q13 Model S sales were 20 percent higher than expected likely played a much larger role in the move.", "Merrill Lynch downplays Tesla's battery storage business citing less potential, myriad challenges and intense competition\n\nIn the research report published on Tuesday, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) downplayed entry of Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) into the battery storage industry. The sell side firm believes that the potential to succeed in such an industry is limited as there are many consumer and industrial challenges, and it is a very competitive market.\n\nMerrill Lynch Research Analyst, John Lovallo, thinks that the there are limited opportunities for the electric vehicle (EV) maker in the battery storage industry and it will take more time than its EV business to make earnings for the company. Mr. Lovallo also touched upon the performance of Panasonic Corporation ADR (OTCMKTS:PCRFY), the EV maker's existing battery supplier.\n\nAlthough, the Japanese electronics company has been in the industry for many years, it hasn't been much prosperous. As per data at BofAML, the stationary storage division of Panasonic has operating margins of 1-2% only. Thus, Mr. Lovallo believes that there is nothing bullish in stepping into the battery storage industry. Even if Tesla establishes ground footing into the industry it will be less lucrative than its core business operations.\n\nBofAML views the EV maker's upcoming announcement as a perfect move by the company to shift investors' mind from its under-performing EV business. Moreover, the research firm believes that Tesla will report a massive operating loss and negative cash flow at its first quarter 2015 (1QFY15) results scheduled for May 6.\n\nMr. Lovallo said that Tesla requires identifying the current net-metering - the ability for a consumer with a renewable energy source, like solar panels, to directly supply surplus energy back to the grid and counterbalance their electricity bill - at the consumer end.\n\nTesla will use lithium ion batteries for its battery storage division and as per Mr. Lovallo, those batteries aren't strong enough to maintain high cycle life - number of full charge or discharge cycles that a battery is able to maintain before its capacity declines below 80% - that is an essential feature of industry storage applications.\n\nNot to forget, Tesla will have to face lithium battery companies that include SAMSUNG ELECT LTD(F) (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and LG CHEM 144A ADR (OTCMKTS:LGCEY) , large industrial companies like General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Siemens AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS:SIEGY), and home generator companies for instance, Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). The EV maker will directly or indirectly compete with many companies in different industries like pumped hydroelectric, ultracapacitors compressed air, flywheels, lead acid batteries and flow batteries.\n\nMr. Lovallo further expressed his bearish sentiments by reiterating stock rating of Underperform on Tesla with price objective of $65.\n\nUnlike Mr. Lovallo, majority of analysts at Wall Street are bullish on Tesla stock. Out of 21 analysts that cover the stock, 11 have rated it as a Buy, seven have rated it as a Hold and three have rated it as a Sell. The 12-month average target price for Tesla is $254.76, which has an upside potential of 10.74%.", "Tomorrow night, if its strong hints are accurate, Tesla Motors will announce that it plans to offer lithium-ion battery packs for home and business energy storage.\n\nSuch storage comes at a cost on top of that of the photovoltaic solar panels that generate the energy.\n\nBut the promise is that such batteries vastly increase the utility of solar panels by allowing the energy they generate to be held on site, and drawn upon when needed.\n\nDON'T MISS: Will Tesla Model 3 Electric Car Hit 2017 Production Date?\n\nToday, most residential solar panels feed excess power into the electric grid--a process known as \"reverse metering.\"\n\nMany states require utilities to accept power from solar panels, which the homeowner \"sells\" to the utility (often at a wholesale rate) while continuing to buy electricity (at retail) when demand exceeds supply.\n\nIn broad plan, the same applies as well to large commercial buildings, making it notable that Tesla has prototyped its energy-storage systems with Wal-Mart, among other large corporations.\n\nThe company has installed batteries in more than 100 pilot programs \"really without anyone noticing,\" according to analyst Andrea James of Bernstein Securities as quoted last week by Bloomberg.\n\nTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk tweeted that tomorrow night's announcement--\"not a car\"--would be a \"major new Tesla product line.\"\n\nThe unveiling will happen at 8 pm Pacific / 11 pm Eastern at Tesla's Southern California design center in Hawthorne.\n\nALSO SEE: 2015 Tesla Model S 70D: First Drive Of New Electric Car Base Model\n\nBut while those batteries will represent a \"major new product,\" estimates of the size of the energy-storage market remain far lower than the auto market.\n\nLast year, roughly 16.5 million vehicles were sold in the United States, at an average price slightly over $30,000, giving a market size of roughly $500 billion.\n\nAccording to a recent report from GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association (ESA), however, the total U.S. market for energy storage in 2019 will grow to $1.5 billion--11 times its size in 2014.\n\nFirst, sale of Tesla home batteries offers an outlet for any excess lithium-ion cell production from the company's Nevada gigafactory.\n\nThat plant's main mission is to provide battery packs for the Tesla Model 3 compact electric car that is expected to launch two to four years hence.\n\nTwo, it may also kick-start the home energy-storage business by attaching the red-hot Tesla brand to a product that so far has very little consumer recognition.\n\nNo large consumer brand thus far markets batteries for storing solar energy onsite to consumers, as far as we know.\n\nAnd there's a strong correlation between electric-car ownership and use of residential solar panels, according to data from California user surveys.\n\nSo a Tesla battery pack could make a Tesla electric car more appealing, especially if it comes with a solar-panel installation deal from Solar City--whose board chairman happens to be one Elon Musk.\n\nFinally, the announcement may serve to keep Tesla Motors in the media eye (and indirectly promote its electric cars) during a publicity lull.\n\nWith the all-wheel-drive versions of the Model S now launched (representing three of the four available versions), Tesla isn't likely to have a major product launch before the arrival of production versions of its Model X electric SUV.\n\nIt could still be several months hence before it starts delivering that utility vehicle to the first buyers.\n\nThat assumes, of course, that Tesla launches the Model X in accordance with its announced schedule of deliveries in the second half of this year.\n\nWith Tesla, you never know--but it's clear that tomorrow evening's unveiling will attract the same rapt attention and social-media outpouring that's associated with anything at all labeled \"Tesla\" or \"Elon Musk.\"", "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is going to launch a battery tomorrow, but there's little enough information out there regarding its specific qualities.

Tesla Motors takes care of electric transport, SolarCity Inc (NASDAQ:SCTY) is a purveyor of solar energy and \"...\" is surely the newest business that Tesla is getting involved in, the home battery business that the company will release its product for tomorrow.\n\nHome batteries, though once an obscure unmentionable, have gained a cool after months of teasers and tidbits out of Tesla Motors. It now seems that the company is going to launch at least two large batteries, one for home and one for business, tomorrow. There may be multiple configurations of each available.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nA couple of analysts have weighed in on the possibilities of the Tesla Home Battery solution. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry wrote recently that the module will cost around $13,000, but will be available on loan with a $1,500 lump sum up front for around $15 per month.\n\nMr. Chowdhry also said that the device had already found its way into several Wal-Mart locations. Those were used as a testing ground for the technology and Wal-Mart may be an early partner for Tesla as the company tries to convince large businesses to store their own electricity in order to lessen the strain on the electrical grid.\n\nTesla Motors shares have increased massively in the run up to the release of the home battery. The company's stock has gained more than 25% in the last thirty days. A lot of those gains have come directly as a result of Elon Musk's tiny Twitter teases.\n\nTesla will reveal its ambitions for the home battery tomorrow along with the key specifications of the machine. May 6 will see Mr. Musk deliver his earnings numbers for the first three months of 2015. The battery business won't be included in those figures, but there may be some rocky trading for Tesla Motors as investors return to the reality of the car business.", "The prominent business personality Elon Musk CEO of Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has revealed that he has greater plans for mattress-shaped batteries that are used in electric cars currently. As per reports, he thinks that these batteries can be converted into upright pillars to be able to power businesses, homes and utilities.\n\nMusk is supposed to unveil a new generation of batteries on Thursday that are designed especially for the growing volume of wind and solar energy. Nothing like that has happened in the past. But if Musk can make everything fall into the line, he will surely be able to create a new business out of existing technology used in the electric cars. The project has a good potential and good enough to generate tens of billions of dollars for Tesla over the next one decade.\n\nEven though batteries have been in use for years, but nobody could ever think from a broader perspective. If Musk can come up with a cost effective way to store a huge volume of energy for future use, it will be a game-changing invention. Tesla is working on a huge 'gigafactory' worth $5 billion near Reno, Nevada. It claims that once the factory is ready, it will start working on the mass production of batteries to bring their costs down and make them available for a wide range of customers including various electricity suppliers.\n\nThere is an event planned for Thursday at Tesla's design studio that is located in Hawthorne, California. As per the reports, the company will announce its newest offering during this event i.e. Tesla home battery and a high-end large utility scale battery. According to Peter Rosegg of Hawaiian Electric Co., whatever be the announcement on Thursday, it's just the beginning.\n\nTesla has never gone after market, and it will do the same again. The market will chase down the company and take it to newer heights.", "Bank of America (BofA) / Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts have issued a bearish estimation of Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) move into the stand-alone battery market. BofA's John Lovallo has called it a move to \"shift investor attention away from a struggling core auto business.\"\n\nBofA analysts have always been more bearish on Tesla than the rest of The Street, which is highly optimistic about Tesla's move into the energy storage business, viewing it as multibillion dollar opportunity for the Palo Alto-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announces its battery product on tomorrow, April 30 at its facility at Hawthorne, California. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, a \"very large\" home and utility-scale battery which the automaker calls \"The Missing Piece,\" will be revealed during the event, according to Motley Fool.\n\nHowever, BofA's long standing Tesla bear, John Lovallo is skeptical, unconvinced of the short term profitability of the venture, especially while the company is already running a loss. That pressure would further mount up as the automaker is set to launch its first tow capable crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV), dubbed Model X, this summer. BofA also predicts Tesla Motors will report a notable operating loss in its Q1FY15 financial results.\n\nAnalysts point to Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) to explain why Tesla Motors will struggle to make profits from selling batteries. BofA has estimated Panasonic's battery profit margin at only 1-2%, despite the its long presence in the global market.\n\nPanasonic has a partnership with Tesla Motors in its lithium-ion battery factory, dubbed 'Gigafactory' at Reno, Nevada.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Lovallo points out that Tesla's lithium-ion batteries might be good to power EVs. However, home-powering batteries aren't the same. Tesla's batteries are undoubted in the EV market where the key measurement is to power density and energy density. Stationary battery performance is measured by the cycle life; how well the battery can perform after several charge and discharge cycles.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have a poor run in terms of lifespan. Degrading with time, they don't hold an electric charge.\n\nMr Lovallo sees several problems. Firstly, if Tesla is able to produce batteries at their cheapest, through the new, $5 billion Gigafactory, they may not be suitable in powering houses and offices. Secondly, Tesla could take many years to build up this part of the business to the required scale. Even that would faced tough competition from other battery giants, such as LG Chem and Generac, both of whom are also pushing their operations into the utility sector.\n\nAlternatively, at Deutsche Bank, Rod Lache is among those who believes the energy storage opportunity could be vastly lucrative for Tesla. His forecasts a $4.5 billion revenue each year, if the batteries are sold at $300kWh, far lower than Tesla's production cost.\n\n1. Lache estimates Tesla could add $100 to each Tesla share if the company can make good on its opportunity. Andrea James at Dougherty &Co. is similarly upbeat. Predicting an extra $70 a share for Tesla Motors.\n\nGlobal Research Equities, Trip Chowdhry, the most optimistic Tesla bull, puts the size of Tesla's opportunity at $200 billion by selling its energy storage products to around 20 million households globally.\n\nAccording to GTM Research, the energy storage business could sell around $1.5 billion worth of battery products in the US alone by 2019.", "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) posted returns of over 25% in the last four weeks, ahead of the firm's announcement on its new generation of batteries for storing large volumes of solar and wind energy. As the deadline for the announcement is approaching, Tesla's shares increased over 10% in the last five trading sessions only.\n\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, Tesla has supplied batteries to homes and commercial businesses like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. through its pilot project with SolarCity Corp., an affiliation which delivered $2.7 million in revenue for the firm in 2014.\n\nLet us take a look on recent notable analysts' views on the stock. Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James forecasts that the company's energy storage business might value $70 per share. Rod Lache, analyst at Deutsche Bank reiterated the Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $245.\n\n\"We have not factored any benefit from this market opportunity into our views on Tesla. Until now, the market has not been provided with sufficient information on the company's planned product offerings, or their growth expectations, to make a judgment. Nonetheless, based on preliminary work on the economics of stationary storage, we believe that this has potential to be more significant than the street currently expects \"said Rod Lache.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nCredit Suisse also reiterated Outperform rating on the company with a price target of $290. Analysts commented that \"\"We believe recent improvements to Tesla products have expanded the addressable market by ~75% and will drive incremental demand. Backlog appears very solid in the 8-9 week range, as US orders today are delivered in June, Europe orders in July, and China orders in late July.\"\n\nOn the other side, Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan analyst maintained underperform rating and cut the price target from $175 to $165. The analyst expects a slower Model X SUV crossover rollout in the later part of the year. CLSA analyst, Andrew Fund also downgraded the stock to $220 from $275.\n\nAndrew said \"I think some of the misconception really is that the Model X is a derivative of the Model S sedan, there are other complexities in the new design and so initial margins may not be as strong as what the investors are anticipating. If you look at initial margins when Tesla launched the model S back in 2012, they were actually in the single digits for the first several quarters and consensus is modelling total gross margin to be flat throughout 2015. So, we expect Model X margin to be ultimately similarly dilutive in the first few quarters and therefore margins will decline sequentially in the back half of this year.\"", "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares jumped 6% on Monday following the news that the car maker is expected to unveil its storage batteries on April 30. Though many are bullish on this new line of revenue for Tesla, there are analysts who cite the technical and fundamentals for not being so enthusiastic about it, says a report from CNBC.\n\nCommenting on the prospects for Tesla, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) (ETR:DBK) (FRA:DB) analyst Rod Lache stated that the stationary storage batteries would raise the earnings by $5 per share by 2020, which would be roughly $100 per share in value. Lache wrote that the initial \"work on the economics of Stationary Storage, we believe that this has potential to be more significant than the Street expects.\"\n\nIn contrast to Lache, there were some on Wall Street who are not so bullish on Tesla. Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Investment Advisory Services, believes that the company's stock is already fully valued, adding that the stock is already 400 times its forward earnings estimates. Supporting her stance, Gibbs noted that the estimates for the EV maker have come down by a whopping 83% in just four months, i.e., from $2.81 to 48 cents for 2015. Further, the analyst noted that the stock is also close to its consensus price target of $267 per share.\n\nTodd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, expects short sellers to get squeezed around the current levels, and believes the stock will hit a resistance somewhere near Wall Street's consensus price target.\n\n\"There's a lot of wood to chop around the $265 level,\" he said. \"That was the high back in early 2014.\" The expert further notes that the options market suggest a slightly lower target. Gordon notes that the market suggests a move of around $20, so the price target based on options is $255, while on the basis of technicals, it is $265. \"Above there and I'm interested. But in the near term, it has a lot to prove,\" Gordon noted.", "Bank Of America: Tesla's Stock In Need Of 'Meaningful Reality Check'\n\nIn a report published Tuesday, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry answered four key questions investors are asking ahead of Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s upcoming Thursday event in which the company will introduce a new product line, assumed to be stationary batteries.\n\nChowdhry noted from a historical perspective, shares of Tesla has always sold off on the news, just like many tech companies, and \"this time may not be any different.\"\n\nHowever, the analyst noted that Tesla's fundamentals are strong and while short-term volatility may be a possibility, he is sticking with his Overweight rating and $385 price target.\n\nRelated Link: Thursday Could Be Huge For Tesla\n\nBased on Chowdhry's research, Tesla is likely to see a $10 billion revenue by 2017 from stationary batteries. The analyst added that Tesla will have a capacity of about 10GWh to 13 GWh and assuming the company sells 100,000 85KWh automobiles in 2017, the cars will consume only 8.5GWh of capacity, implying the remaining 1.5GWh could go into the Stationary Residential batteries.\n\nThe math behind the $10 billion figure is as follows: \"Assuming 15KWh Stationary Battery and then multiply with one million units = 1.5GWh. Conservatively, assuming an average selling price of $10,000 gives a revenue opportunity from Residential Batteries of $10 billion for Tesla in 2017.\"\n\nSimply speaking, Chowdhry answered that Tesla will face no competition in the space. He noted that for any competition to significant, they will need to operate a \"TeraFactory\" or \"PetaFactory\" to rival Tesla's GigaFactory, and so far no such facility exists.\n\n\"Tesla has the scale, technology and time advantage, which will be very difficult for the competitors to replicate,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nSimilar to the third question, the answer is a simple \"no,\" as solar panels are not the most compelling reason for a customer to buy a Residential Storage battery. Rather, an \"always on\" power backup seems to be the most compelling reason, Chowdhry argued.", "Elon Musk is always talking about innovations and working to develop new concepts and devices that are ultimately making our world a better place. His company Tesla is synonymous with electric cars and he recently hinted that the company is working on a new device which we hope to see soon. However, the device doesn't have anything to with electric cars.\n\nMusk tweeted that Tesla will debut a new product on April 30. Rumors suggest that the new device will be a battery capable of powering a whole house during blackout. It is also rumored that Tesla has another type of battery up its sleeves that is for utility companies.\n\nThe battery deploys some smart strategies to save cost as well. It gets charged at night when electricity is cheapest and then the battery can be used to power the house when the electricity is out or during the day when electricity costs are high.\n\nThis battery for homes is reported to work in conjunction with solar panels for residencies. The battery will work like uninterruptible power supply which is commonly used with computers, just that it can power your entire home.\n\nThe battery has been offered to 300 customers of SolarCity. According to these customers, the battery comes in 10 and 15 kWh units and sells for around $13,000. The whole device/setup will cost $15,000 with an option of $15 monthly for ten years. After the ten years, the battery goes back to SolarCity.\n\nTesla Motors has not given any official word on the type of device yet. It will be unveiled on April 30.", "The art of storing power and its viability as a business could become clear when Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) officially unveils its home batteries business. It is seen as a venture able to guarantee billions of dollars in annual revenue as utilities, homes, and business call for reliable power supplies. Tesla may have a found a gold mine in the name of the battery business that should once and for all rest the long running question on the company's ability to turn in profit, soon.\n\nTesla Motors is expected to showcase how it plans to dominate the fast-growing battery market not only for powering homes, but big power companies looking to store power from solar and wind farms. Completion of the $5 billion battery factory in Nevada should provide a clear-cut opportunity for the EV giant to scale its battery business while also powering its line of electric cars\n\nThe battery factory was specifically developed to power the automakers EV cars but as much as 25% of the total production is expected to be directed to powering homes, businesses, and companies. However CEO, Elon Musk, faces a daunting task of explaining why the stationary battery business is good for Tesla Motors considering 3% of the total production could meet the total global demand this year.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nConvincing the market why its batteries are a better solution is Tesla next objective as the company looks to take the lead in the fast growing business. The opening of the battery factory in 2016 is expected to lower battery costs by 30%, which should give Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) the much-needed advantage in the business in terms of pricing. The plant is expected to work at full capacity as Tesla moves to power its line of electric cars while also supplying battery packs for businesses and homes.\n\nTesla Motors is already banking on an immediate customer in the name of SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ: SCTY), a solar company that needs batteries more than ever for powering homes currently relying on solar energy. As part of a pilot program, the automaker built more than 300 home based battery packs with a view of seeing how reliable they can be as people limit their use of the grid power.\n\nStationary batteries are already receiving support from a number of states such as New York and Texas which are encouraging companies to store energy as one of the ways of easing congestion on transmission lines.", "Sentiments that Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is more of a battery company than an automaker could be affirmed on Thursday, when CEO, Elon Musk, takes to the podium to unveil a new generation of batteries. The $5 billion Gigafactory in Nevada is seen as a key driver on the EV giant becoming a force to reckon with, in the home lighting business through solar power and batteries.\n\nThere is no company in the power industry that has been able to come up with a cost-effective ways of storing power in large volumes to Tesla's levels. Betting big on the Gigafactory, Tesla Motors hopes to drive down the costs of batteries that should allow it gain a competitive advantage in the business. The long term plan is to attend to a huge base of customers more so companies and corporates which are expected to buy big packs of the batteries.\n\nThe battery business is expected to grow at a tremendous rate as homes businesses, and utilities yearn for reliable power supplies and what a better way to achieve the same than by using solar and wind energy. These enterprises are expected to store electricity during peak production times and then use it when the sun is not shining more so during the night, which should lead to reduced power bills.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nTesla is making a push for the home battery business that is expected to grow to more than $68 billion by 2024 as grid operators look for creative ways to store power. The business is already gaining traction, the EV giant having installed a number of batteries in a number of retail outlets. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) believes the energy storage business could grow to billions of dollars in annual sales as it moves to combine the patented lithium-ion batteries technology with advanced power management software.\n\nTesla Motors will specifically target wind and solar developers who are expected to place massive orders that should help drive its business. It is however not expected to be an easy ride for the Palo Alto Company as it is poised to face stiff competition from other companies already producing batteries such as AES Corp (NYSE: AES).\n\nRegulatory hurdles should also pose another headwind in the attempt of navigating state by state markets. However, the business is also regulatory driven with states like New York pushing big utilities to use power storage banks to relieve transmission lines of some congestion. Tesla Motors is sensing a big opportunity which it can use to capitalize.", "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Elon Musk thinks he can pave the way to a better energy future by turning the mattress-shaped batteries in Tesla's electric car into upright pillars so they can be used to power homes, businesses and even utilities.\n\nMusk will lift the veil Thursday on a new generation of batteries designed to store growing volumes of solar and wind energy. If he gets it right, Tesla Motors Inc. will have spun a significant second business off the technology originally designed for its electric vehicles -- and will gain a toehold in a business projected to generate tens of billions of dollars in a decade.\n\nNobody in the power industry has yet been able to come up with a cost-effective way to store large volumes of energy for later distribution. Tesla is making a bet that its huge $5 billion \"gigafactory\" currently under construction near Reno, Nevada, will enable the mass production needed to drive down the cost of batteries and make them competitive for a broad range of customers, including traditional suppliers of electricity.\n\nTesla has scheduled an event Thursday at its design studio in Hawthorne, California, to announce both a Tesla home battery and what it called last week in a note to investors \"a very large utility scale battery.\"\n\n\"Whatever Tesla announces on Thursday is just the beginning,\" said Peter Rosegg, spokesman for Hawaiian Electric Co., where 12 percent of the utility's customers have rooftop solar panels. \"Tesla doesn't have to go after the market -- the market will come to them. We're very eager to see what they have to say.\"\n\nGrowth Business\n\nTesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has its eye on a business that's poised for tremendous growth. As homes, businesses and utilities use more renewable energy generated by sun and wind, the need to provide for reliable power grows. Batteries can be used to store electricity during peak production times, and then dispense it later when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nA January report from Navigant Research estimates that worldwide revenue from grid-scale energy storage could total more than $68 billion by 2024 as renewable resources multiply and electricity grid operators seek ways to balance their mix of generation assets.\n\nTesla is already supplying batteries to homes and commercial businesses such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. through pilot projects and a supply agreement with SolarCity Corp., a relationship that generated $2.7 million in revenue for Tesla in 2014, according to a recent regulatory filing. That's less than one tenth of one percent of the automaker's total for last year.\n\nThinking Bigger\n\nBut Tesla is thinking much bigger, saying in job postings that its energy-storage business will soon grow to billions in sales. Musk plans to combine the strengths of the company's patented lithium-ion batteries, which currently can run a car for about 265 miles per charge, with its expertise in power management software.\n\nMusk's green power ambitions involve three inter-connected enterprises: SolarCity, where he serves as chairman, the battery factory in Nevada, and the Tesla car business. With the move into energy storage, Tesla can help green the grid that fuels its cars while offering solar customers a way to store any excess electricity in batteries for use during hours of less sunlight and greater demand.\n\nAn even larger potential market will be utility companies that have traditionally generated power with coal and natural gas.\n\nUtility Customers\n\n\"Tesla isn't just going to sell batteries to SolarCity,\" said Ben Kallo, an analyst with R.W. Baird & Co. \"They are going to sell to project developers, wind and solar developers, and directly to utilities. The residential product isn't going to be a huge needle mover, but the numbers are very big on the utility side.\"\n\nTesla will face competition from other battery makers such as Korea's LG Chem Ltd. and legacy U.S. power providers such as AES Corp. and start-ups such as JLM Energy Inc. It will have to navigate regulatory hurdles in a state-by-state market with varying degrees of subsidies and incentives for the technology.\n\nUtilities, more cautious by nature, have been slow to adopt storage on their own.\n\n\"Storage doesn't neatly fit into transmission, distribution or generation categories so it can be tough for utilities to justify investing in storage projects,\" said Brian Warshay, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \"Some utilities, like the California investor-owned companies, are getting into storage because their regulator basically told them they have to.\"\n\nRegulator Driven\n\nIn Tesla's home state, a groundbreaking energy-storage mandate requires PG&E Corp., Edison International's Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric to collectively buy 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by the end of 2020. New York is also pushing utilities to use storage to relieve congestion on transmission lines and plans for the expected retirement of the Indian Point nuclear power plant.\n\nAll these companies are potential customers for Tesla. The automaker has been in talks to provide its batteries to Oncor Electric Delivery Co., the largest power-line owner in Texas.\n\n\"Batteries really are kind of a panacea for the grid,\" said Don Clevenger, senior vice president of strategic planning for Oncor, said. \"They provide better reliability.\""], "2015-04-30": ["Clean-water advocate takes Earth Day swim in New York's Gowanus Canal, a Superfund siteMore >>\n\nJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe started a three-day visit to California on Thursday with plans to check out tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the governor.\n\nDuring a speech at Stanford, Abe said Japan needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years.\n\nHe compared the effort to Japan sending baseball players to major league baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe said he plans to meet with Google and Facebook executives and visit electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nLater in the day, the Japanese leader will head to San Francisco and invite Gov.

Stationary batteries can help smooth out the power flow at times when renewables are not producing (lack of wind, or lack of sun, for instance).\n\nAlong with building the multibillion-dollar battery Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla has teamed up with solar installer SolarCity, where Musk is chairman and the top shareholder, on battery-based storage for homes and businesses that have solar panel systems. That stored power can be used when the sun isn't shining.\n\nTesla and SolarCity last month said they've teamed up to build entire tiny power grids using Tesla lithium-ion batteries. Samsung SDI also announced a strategic alliance along similar lines, with global automation technology firm ABB (NYSE:ABB).

The bill passed with support from the House, Senate, Governor, and ultimately, even the Maryland Automobile Dealers Association.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the bill was entirely unopposed.\n\nAs Autoblog reports, at the eleventh hour of the bill's gestation, General Motors decided to get involved, voicing a dissenting opinion toward Tesla's company-owned stores being allowed in Maryland - and across the country. GM's lobbying prowess even nearly prevailed, stalling the Maryland House Bill's passage until just 6 minutes before its deadline.\n\nAutoblog reached out to General Motors for comment, prompting a response from GM Spokeswoman Laura Toole which read: \"While not specific to just Maryland, we also believe all industry participants should operate under the same rules and requirements on fundamental issues that govern how we sell, service and market our products. GM plans to compete in the all-electric vehicle market. By enacting HB 235, multiple manufacturers may compete with similarly capable vehicles and similar price points, yet they would operate under a distinctly different set of rules, which is why we opposed HB 235.\"\n\nMaryland House Bill 235 specifies that any automaker may have up to four company-owned stores in the state so long as that automaker produces exclusively electric or alternative fuel vehicles. That portion of the legislature is meant to apply exclusively to Tesla, or at least protect Maryland dealers from competition from the manufacturers that they peddle.\n\nAnd indeed, on one side of the argument is that state legislation forbidding manufacturer-owned stores was originally intended to protect third party dealers from competition from the automaker. That's noteworthy in this case because, of course, Tesla Motors has no third party dealership franchise to encroach upon. However, automakers such as General Motors argue that the effect of overturning or modifying said legislation allows companies like Tesla a different rule set that may grant an unfair advantage in the marketplace.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n\"We rate TESLA MOTORS INC (TSLA) a SELL. This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, weak operating cash flow, poor profit margins and generally high debt management risk.\"\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Automobiles industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 561.8% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$16.26 million to -$107.63 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Automobiles industry and the overall market, TESLA MOTORS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has significantly decreased to -$86.40 million or 166.58% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower. The gross profit margin for TESLA MOTORS INC is currently lower than what is desirable, coming in at 34.46%. Regardless of TSLA's low profit margin, it has managed to increase from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, TSLA's net profit margin of -11.25% significantly underperformed when compared to the industry average. The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 2.51 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio is weak, TSLA's quick ratio is somewhat strong at 1.02, demonstrating the ability to handle short-term liquidity needs.

Indeed, it could be an announcement that could launch a new era worthy of the futuristic utopia of the' Jetsons', perhaps one that will mark the true start of the 21st century in cultural terms.\n\nIndeed, in February, Elon Musk boasted that Tesla Motors would realize that no car manufacturer had never done, reaching a market capitalization of US$700 billion in 2025, more than the value of automotive giants such as Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, Toyota and Honda, the sum of whose market values is no more than US$522 billion.\n\nEither Elon Musk is delusional or he has a secret strategy. In fact, the strategy is not very cryptic; in order to achieve ambitious market targets, Tesla will have to step beyond the automotive sector. Musk, likes to say that he wants to \"change the world\". He has already changed the automotive world.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a Mercedes Benz, BMW or Cadillac driver taking the impact of an electric powered luxury sedan seriously. Yet, the Tesla Model S is on sale and working as promised.\n\nThe company plans to upgrade its software across the entire Model S range, including those it sold two years ago, allowing partial driverless functions on the highway. The 2013 Model S will take you from Silicon Valley to LA without a driver having to touch the steering wheel, the accelerator or the brake pedal - unless you decide to leave the motorway for a bite to eat or stretch your legs.\n\nThis automatic upgrade, achieved through downloadable software at Tesla dealers, is a great marketing coup. It means that just like an I-phone, which is updated to improve performance through various iterations of the IOS operating system, Tesla can upgrade your model with new features years after it is delivered from the dealership.\n\nIn 2017, Tesla will introduce its affordable model, an electric car for about 35,000 dollars - a price comparable to the 30,026 dollars paid on average for a new car at an American dealer.

The electric car manufacturer is expected to unveil a home and commercial power storage solution. Tesla is said to be at the forefront of innovative battery technology and its $5 billion Gigafactory in Nevada, that is currently under construction, is expected to be the largest battery manufacturing facility across the globe when it opens in 2017.\n\nKeeping in view Tesla's high ambitions, with respect to its battery production, Bernstein analysts have assessed as to how much of the company's entire value is on part of its battery manufacturing division, said to contribute significantly to earnings once its fully operational. It should be noted that Bernstein doesn't cover Tesla's stock and therefore doesn't have a rating and a price target on it. Analysts at the firm value the Gigafactory at $40-$100 per one Tesla share or 20%-40% of the stock's current price. The Gigafactory that is expected to be operational in the next two years, reportedly with a production capacity that is greater than the entire battery manufacturing industry in 2013.\n\nThe investment firm sees robust growth for Tesla's battery division in the near term, noting that the company has substantial cost advantage with its small cylindrical battery technology, over competing manufacturers operating in the same segment. They however note that as suppliers such as Panasonic, Samsung SDI and LG Chem, upgrade their own technological capabilities, Tesla would lose its cost advantage.\n\nBernstein estimates that by 2020, when the Gigafactory ramps up to provide a production output of 35GWh, Tesla would account for 19% of the overall industry supply. Five years after that this will decline to 8%, as competitors make increasing developments in NMC based large prismatic-cells. Although Tesla's NCA-based small cylindrical cells are adequate for cars like the one's it manufactures, Bernstien believes it will face a tough time in the energy storage space due to the presence of NMC-based prismatic cells, that are more preferred in the segment.\n\nThe firm also added that Tesla could greatly benefit from SolarCity, which is majority-owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. As SolarCity expands it network of clean energy solutions using home battery storage as key component, Tesla's Gigafactory would see ample demand for it products.\n\nEven so Bernstein maintains that Tesla's prospects, with regards to battery production, 'go beyond SolarCity and luxury motor vehicles'. Bernstein notes that if Tesla succeeds in its greater objectives, which is to 'transform energy into technology' in the process shaking up auto and energy markets across the globe, the above mentioned value for the Gigafactory would be greatly understated.\n\nBernstien noted that the Gigafactory can allow Tesla to sell energy storage at 17% gross margins into 'a $2 trillion oil market and $400 million oil market'. Bernstein claims that considering the limitless long term opportunities at Tesla's disposal from this division, the company should shift its focus away from auto manufacture to only batteries.

Such batteries vastly increase the utility of solar panels by allowing the energy they generate to be held on site, and drawn upon when needed.\n\nTonight, if its strong hints are accurate, Tesla Motors will announce that it plans to offer lithium-ion battery packs for home and business energy storage\n\nSuch storage comes at a cost on top of that of the photovoltaic solar panels that generate the energy.\n\nBut the promise is that such batteries vastly increase the utility of solar panels by allowing the energy they generate to be held on site, and drawn upon when needed.\n\nToday, most residential solar panels feed excess power into the electric grid--a process known as \"reverse metering.\"\n\nMany states require utilities to accept power from solar panels, which the homeowner \"sells\" to the utility (often at a wholesale rate) while continuing to buy electricity (at retail) when demand exceeds supply.\n\nIn broad plan, the same applies as well to large commercial buildings, making it notable that Tesla has prototyped its energy-storage systems with Wal-Mart, among other large corporations.\n\nThe company has installed batteries in more than 100 pilot programs \"really without anyone noticing,\" according to analyst Andrea James of Bernstein Securities as quoted last week by Bloomberg.\n\nTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk tweeted that tomorrow night's announcement--\"not a car\"--would be a \"major new Tesla product line.\"\n\nThe unveiling will happen at 8 pm Pacific / 11 pm Eastern at Tesla's Southern California design center in Hawthorne.\n\nBut while those batteries will represent a \"major new product,\" estimates of the size of the energy-storage market remain far lower than the auto market.\n\nLast year, roughly 16.5 million vehicles were sold in the United States, at an average price slightly over $30,000, giving a market size of roughly $500 billion.\n\nAccording to a recent report from GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association (ESA), however, the total U.S. market for energy storage in 2019 will grow to $1.5 billion--11 times its size in 2014.\n\nFirst, sale of Tesla home batteries offers an outlet for any excess lithium-ion cell production from the company's Nevada gigafactory.\n\nThat plant's main mission is to provide battery packs for the Tesla Model 3 compact electric car that is expected to launch two to four years hence.\n\nTwo, it may also kick-start the home energy-storage business by attaching the red-hot Tesla brand to a product that so far has very little consumer recognition.\n\nNo large consumer brand thus far markets batteries for storing solar energy onsite to consumers, as far as we know.\n\nAnd there's a strong correlation between electric-car ownership and use of residential solar panels, according to data from California user surveys.\n\nSo a Tesla battery pack could make a Tesla electric car more appealing, especially if it comes with a solar-panel installation deal from Solar City--whose board chairman happens to be one Elon Musk.\n\nFinally, the announcement may serve to keep Tesla Motors in the media eye (and indirectly promote its electric cars) during a publicity lull.\n\nWith the all-wheel-drive versions of the Model S now launched (representing three of the four available versions), Tesla isn't likely to have a major product launch before the arrival of production versions of its Model X electric SUV.\n\nIt could still be several months hence before it starts delivering that utility vehicle to the first buyers.\n\nThat assumes, of course, that Tesla launches the Model X in accordance with its announced schedule of deliveries in the second half of this year.\n\nWith Tesla, you never know--but it's clear that tomorrow evening's unveiling will attract the same rapt attention and social-media outpouring that's associated with anything at all labeled \"Tesla\" or \"Elon Musk.\"", "Elon Musk, the entreprenuerial wiz, co-founder of PayPal and Zip2 and founder of SpaceX and now Tesla Motors (JD Lasica/Flickr)\n\nTesla Motors already makes batteries for its electric cars. On Thursday, it's expected to introduce battery systems for homes, businesses and electric utilities.\n\nThe spread of cost-effective batteries will fundamentally change the way the electric grid operates. Combined with other innovations, batteries in homes and businesses will transform how people and businesses treat electricity.\n\nAlong the way, these batteries will improve the efficiency and reliability of the grid overall.\n\nRight now, most power is generated at large power plants and distributed to consumers. Electric energy storage allows a two-way flow of power, which offers some significant advantages for support of the power grid. For example, storage is particularly useful for offsetting the intermittent nature of wind and solar photovoltaics, which don't produce power on demand as a fossil fuel power plant does.\n\nFor an individual consumer, having a battery behind the meter provides a great deal of flexibility in managing energy use. Batteries allow consumers to cut their electric bills by reducing how much power they consume during peak hours when power costs more, which is the case in many states such as California.\n\nHomes with rooftop solar panels and batteries can actually use energy from their solar systems during power outages and, with a modest amount of storage, have sufficient power to last for days if the grid is out. And with enough storage, they can disconnect from the grid indefinitely - a development utilities fear.\n\nA number of states have net metering, programs in which utilities purchase the excess electricity from solar panels that's fed into the grid. In combination with net metering, behind-the-meter storage creates the opportunity for customers to buy power from the grid when prices are low and then sell stored energy from batteries when prices are high. This practice, known as arbitrage, has led to concerns at utilities which have levied large additional charges for equipment installations in some places.\n\nCommercial and industrial customers stand to benefit from behind-the-meter storage as well. They can reduce their usage during times of peak demand and cut so-called demand charges - fees for maximum power usage - that can dominate how much they pay for energy.\n\nFrom the perspective of the power grid, electric vehicles (EVs) can in many respects be considered a variation of behind-the-meter storage - they just happen to be mobile.\n\nEV batteries can hold a significant amount of energy. The Nissan Leaf, for example, holds 24 kilowatt-hours, while an average house will use 30 kilowatt-hours per day, so a car battery could provide backup power during an outage.\n\nBut electric cars create challenges for grid operators. Because they draw so much current during charging, there is the potential to overload circuits that serve neighborhoods. In order to mitigate this and avoid the cost of upgrading the infrastructure, some utilities offer, or require, special tariffs that reward EV charging at night when energy demand and prices are low.\n\nBy charging when the power use is low, EVs can help flatten the typical load curve of the grid and draw power at off-peak hours at night.\n\nSince EVs are pulling power off the grid, they can also offset excess power production from wind in particular, which often generates more power than can be used late at night. That can help generators avoid the negative pricing - when excess power reduces the real-time price of power to less than zero - sometimes associated with excessive wind generation conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, EVs can address the decreasing power sales utilities have been experiencing by adding what is a essentially another power-hungry appliance to their monthly bills.\n\nClose on the horizon is so-called vehicle to grid (V2G) technology. Standards will finally make it possible to use the EV battery in two-way operation with utilities. The University of Delaware, for example, has experimented with ways to connect parked EVs to the electric grid. When grid operators need a short burst of power or have excess power, they push power back and forth into the EVs' batteries. Owners could be paid for these services.\n\nA real game changer, however, would be if utilities could manage the behind-the-meter storage with another technology known as demand response - or cutting power use at key times during the day.\n\nUtilities used to make deals with large energy users, such as factories, and call them on the phone to cut power use during peak power days. For example, in the middle of a hot summer day when the load from air conditioning is high, grid operators struggle to meet the demand. Cutting power during those peak hours gives them more capacity to avoid brownouts. And in exchange for agreeing to reduce power on peak days, customers get some sort of payment.\n\nThe phone calls of old evolved into automated systems. And eventually, in deregulated markets, businesses formed that collect the demand response commitments from multiple large energy users. Then they sell that capacity to reduce power when needed on the daily energy markets. This has been an effective method for reducing dependence on the polluting and expensive generators that only run for those few weeks of peak needs.\n\nMore recently utilities - particularly those with hourly pricing plans such as ComEd in Illinois and Austin Energy in Texas - have begun experimenting with demand response in the residential market.\n\nSmart thermostat maker Nest uses its internet-connected thermostat to respond to demand response requests on peak demand days. Customers can respond to a day-ahead phone notification by choosing to opt out of the event or they can simply adjust the thermostat to opt out after the utility has given the signal.\n\nSome more recent demand response experiments involve hour-ahead notification. So far these experiments have mostly dealt with adjusting thermostats to reduce loads, but appliances are now being sold with the ability to use real-time pricing for operating decisions.\n\nWhat if the behind-the-meter storage could be dispatched by demand response signals? If utilities could draw on the energy stored in behind-the-meter batteries and EVs, it could have a range of benefits. The connected storage could lower power costs by eliminating some peak generation needs and provide a buffer for variable wind and solar power.\n\nFor the consumer, energy storage enables a whole new way to look at home electricity use. It can provide energy security, lower energy costs and eventually offer an opportunity to become part of the market for buying and selling power.", "Tesla Motors shares slipped on Thursday after a month-long surge ahead of chief executive Elon Musk's expected announcement that the money-losing electric luxury car maker will seek new revenues from batteries for storing electricity at homes and businesses.\n\nMusk and other Tesla officials have dropped a series of broad hints over the past month about the topic of the announcement, which is scheduled for 8pm Pacific time on Thursday at a Tesla facility near Los Angeles.\n\nTesla shares are up about 20% since 30 March, when Musk tweeted that the company would unveil a \"major new Tesla product line - not a car\".

How long can Tesla's battery last: two hours, four hours?

Tesla is widely expected to announce that it is offering a home battery product, which people can use to store energy from their solar panels or to backstop their homes against blackouts, and also a \"very large utility-scale\" battery product, which may do the same for large companies or even parts of the grid.\n\nThe anticipation leading up to the announcement has been intense -- words like \"zeitgeist\" are being used -- which itself is one reason why the moment for \"energy storage,\" as energy wonks put it to describe batteries and other technologies that save energy for later use, may finally be arriving. Prices for batteries have already been dropping, but if Tesla adds a \"coolness factor\" to the equation, people might even be willing to stretch their finances to buy one.\n\n[Powering your home with batteries is going to get cheaper and cheaper]\n\nThe truth, though, is Tesla isn't the only company in the battery game, and whatever happens with Tesla, this market is expected to grow. A study by GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association earlier this year found that while storage remains relatively niche -- the market was sized at just $139 million in 2014 -- it also grew a striking 400 percent last year, and three times as many installations are expected this year.\n\nBy 2019, GTM Research forecasts, the overall market will have reached a size of $ 1.4 billion.\n\n\"The trend is more and more players being interested in the storage market,\" says GTM Research's Ravi Manghani. Tesla, he says, has two unique advantages -- it is building a massive battery-making \"gigafactory\" which should drive down prices, and it is partnered with solar installer Solar City (Musk is Solar City's chairman), which \"gives Tesla access to a bigger pool of customers, both residential and commercial, who are looking to deploy storage with or without solar.\"\n\n[Why your next home might be battery powered]\n\nThe major upshot of more and cheaper batteries and much more widespread energy storage could, in the long term, be a true energy revolution -- as well as a much greener planet. Here are just a few ways that storage can dramatically change -- and green -- the way we get power:\n\n1. Helping to integrate more renewables onto the grid.\n\nAlmost everybody focusing the Tesla story has homed in on home batteries - but in truth, the biggest impact of storage could occur at the level of the electricity grid as a whole. Indeed, GTM Research's survey of the storage market found that 90 percent of deployments are currently at the utility scale, rather than in homes and businesses.\n\nThat's probably just the beginning: A late 2014 study by the Brattle Group, prepared for mega-Texas utility Oncor, found that energy storage \"appears to be on the verge of becoming quite economically attractive\" and that the benefits of deploying storage across Texas would \"significantly exceed costs\" thanks to improved energy grid reliability. Oncor has proposed spending as much as $ 5.2 billion on storage investments in the state. California, too, has directed state utilities to start developing storage capacity - for specifically environmental reasons.\n\nFor more power storage doesn't just hold out the promise of a more reliable grid -- it means one that can rely less on fossil fuels and more on renewable energy sources like wind and, especially, solar, which vary based on the time of day or the weather. Or as a 2013 Department of Energy report put it, \"storage can 'smooth' the delivery of power generated from wind and solar technologies, in effect, increasing the value of renewable power.\"\n\n\"Storage is a game changer,\" said Tom Kimbis, vice president of executive affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement. That's for many reasons, according to Kimbis, but one of them is that \"grid-tied storage helps system operators manage shifting peak loads, renewable integration, and grid operations.\" (In fairness, the wind industry questions how much storage will be needed to add more wind onto the grid.)\n\nConsider how this might work using the example of California, a state that currently ramps up natural gas plants when power demand increases at peak times, explains Gavin Purchas, head of the Environmental Defense Fund's California clean energy program.\n\nIn California, \"renewable energy creates a load of energy in the day, then it drops off in the evening, and that leaves you with a big gap that you need to fill,\" says Purchas. \"If you had a plenitude of storage devices, way down the road, then you essentially would be able to charge up those storage devices during the day, and then dispatch them during the night, when the sun goes down. Essentially it allows you to defer when the solar power is used.\"\n\nThis will be appealing to power companies, notes Purchas, because \"gas is very quick to respond, but it's not anywhere near as quick as battery, which can be done in seconds, as opposed to minutes with gas.\" The consequences of adding large amounts of storage to the grid, then, could be not only a lot fewer greenhouse gas emissions, but also better performance.\n\n2. Greening suburban homes and, maybe, their electric cars, too.\n\nShifting away from the grid to the home, batteries or other forms of storage have an equally profound potential, especially when paired with rooftop solar panels.\n\nCurrently, rooftop solar users are able to draw power during the day and, under net metering arrangements, return some of it to the grid and thus lower their bills. This has led to a great boom in individual solar installations, but there's the same problem here as there is with the grid as a whole: Solar tapers off with the sun, but you still need a lot of power throughout the evening and overnight.\n\nBut storing excess solar power with batteries, and then switching them on once the solar panels stop drawing from the sun, makes a dramatic difference. Homes could shift even further away from reliance on the grid, while also using much more green power.\n\nMoreover, they'd also be using it at a time of day when its environmental impact is greater. \"If you think about solar, when it's producing in the middle of the day, the environmental footprint is relatively modest,\" explains Dartmouth University business professor Erin Mansur. That's because at this time of day, Mansur explains, solar is more likely to be displacing electricity generated from less carbon intensive natural gas. \"But if you can shift some of that to the evening ... if you can save some to the middle of the night, it's more likely to be displacing coal,\" says Mansur.\n\nSome day, perhaps, some of the sun-sourced and power could even be widely used to recharge electric vehicles like Teslas -- which would solve another problem. According to a much discussed 2012 paper by Mansur and two colleagues, electric vehicles can have a surprisingly high energy footprint despite their lack of tailpipe emissions because they are often charged over night, a time when the power provided to the grid (said to be \"on the margin\") often comes from coal.\n\nBut if electric vehicles could be charged overnight using stored power from the sun, that problem also goes away.\n\nAll of which contributes to a larger vision outlined recently by a team of researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability in which suburban homeowners, who can install rooftop solar combined with batteries and drive electric vehicles, start to dramatically reduce their carbon footprints -- which have long tended to be bigger in suburbia, due in part to the need for long commutes -- and also their home energy bills.\n\n[How solar power and electric cars could make suburban living awesome again]\n\nGranted, it's still a vision right now, rather than a reality for the overwhelming number of suburbanites -- but energy storage is a key part of that vision.\n\n3. Helping adjust to smart energy pricing\n\nAnd there's another factor to add into the equation, which shows how energy storage could further help homeowners save money.\n\nFor a long time, economists have said that we need \"smart\" or \"dynamic\" electricity pricing -- that people should be charged more for power at times of high energy demand, such as in the afternoon and early evening, when the actual electricity itself costs more on wholesale markets. This would lead to lower prices overall, but higher prices during peak periods. And slowly, such smart pricing schemes are being introduced to the grid (largely on a voluntary basis).\n\nBut if you combine \"smart\" pricing with solar and energy storage, then homeowners have another potential benefit, explains Ravi Manghani of GTM Research. They could store excess power from their solar panels during the day, and then actually use it in the evening when prices for electricity go up -- and avoid the higher cost. \"There's an economic case to store the excess solar generation and use it during evening hours,\" explains Manghani by email. (For more explanation, see here.)\n\nNotably, if there are future reductions in how much money solar panel owners can make selling excess power back to the grid -- and that's one thing the current pushback against net metering wants to achieve -- then energy storage comes in and gives panel owners a new way for using that power.\n\n\"Storage increases the options,\" explains Sean Gallagher, vice president of state affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association. \"It's an enabling technology for solar. It allows customers to meet more scenarios economically.\"\n\nSo in sum -- cheaper, more easily available energy storage helps at the scale of the power grid, and also at the level of our homes, to further advantage cleaner, renewable energy. So if the economics of storage are finally starting to line up -- and its business side to ramp up -- that can only be good news for the planet.\n\nAlso in Energy & Environment:\n\nPoll: Millennials are no more convinced about global warming than their parents\n\nAutomatic bill payment may be driving up your energy use -- and your bills", "Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is starting a three-day visit to California with plans to check out some of the region's tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the state's governor.\n\nOn a swing through Silicon Valley on Thursday, Abe will speak with Stanford University experts about innovation and also work to build relationships with tech firms and investors.

I caught up with three companies -- SolarCity, AES Energy Storage and Sungevity -- in the last few days to get a snapshot of the business models and projects that are emerging in this market.\n\nI discussed SolarCity in my story yesterday about Tesla's challenges in building an energy storage business. So here I'll share what I've learned from executives from AES Energy Storage, which has been building and running big energy storage projects since 2008, and Sungevity, a solar installer that plans to offer storage with solar panels for homes and businesses later this year.\n\nA battery system from Germany-based Sonnenbatterie, which is launching its systems in the U.S.\n\nBut first, I want to point out why energy storage is attracting more interest from tech companies and investors these days. A big reason is that energy storage is set to play an important role in a movement to disrupt the electricity generation and delivery service. If that's truly the case, then it will be a big money-making business.\n\nRight now most of us rely on power plant owners and utilities to generate and pipe energy to us via an often expansive network of transmission towers and power lines. The rise of large solar power plants and rooftop solar panel installations is meant to move us away from relying on the polluting coal and natural gas power plants. It also has inspired a view of a future in which we will all be producing most if not all of the electricity we need at home or work. Energy storage will play a key role in that scenario by banking excess solar electricity produced during the day for use when the solar panels aren't cranking out power.\n\n\"With a battery system, I can consume (solar energy) whenever I want. It delivers a new level of independence,\" said Peter Graf, Sungevity's new chief product officer.\n\nThat future is a long way off for most, though. The credible forecasts I've seen peg solar as making up perhaps a quarter of the world's electricity generation by 2050. Less than that in the U.S. by 2040, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "Tesla Motors Chief Executive Elon Musk plans to launch the electric car market into a new product line -- batteries for home and business energy storage.\n\nThat would allow users, for instance, to charge batteries at night -- when energy rates are cheap -- and use the power during peak hours in the daytime.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur will provide details of the plan before hundreds of invited guests at the Tesla design studio in Hawthorne on Thursday night.\n\nAlready, Tesla has been dabbling in energy storage, providing batteries for some Walmart stores and others. Musk is expected to ramp up the program, in part to make more use of the giant battery factory that Tesla is building near Reno, which will also supply batteries to Tesla cars.\n\nWe discussed the battery strategy with industry analyst Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner Inc., who follows Musk and Tesla closely. Here are five questions he thinks Musk should answer Thursday night.\n\n1. How much will it cost?\n\nWhat's the value for customers? How will they make a return on their investment in the equipment?\n\n2. Who will buy this?\n\nIs this primarily for people or businesses that have solar systems, and need a way to store the power they create? Will the batteries be useful for people who don't own solar panels or electric cars?\n\n3. How will Musk use stationary batteries -- as opposed to the ones that power Tesla cars -- to knit his companies together?\n\nMusk also is the chairman of SolarCity and has worked with the solar energy provider to place Tesla batteries in some locations. Is this a Tesla product, or a Solar City product, or both? Will there be co-branding?\n\nWill owners of Tesla cars or Solar City panels get any particular perks from this product?\n\n4. How will Musk sell energy storage?\n\nConsumers are often confused by the different purchase and lease options offered by solar energy companies. Explaining energy storage in batteries adds another layer of potential confusion.\n\n\"This entire space has suffered for a long time because it has been so difficult for consumers to understand what it is about, and what the business case is for the products,\" Koslowski said.\n\n5. How will Musk leverage the Tesla name?\n\nTesla can make the concept of a home battery much more appealing to mainstream consumers than other companies because it is an innovative brand that is becoming widely known and respected.\n\nHow will Musk use that reputation to sell energy storage?\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@LATimesJerry), Facebook and Google+.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times", "Sometimes I wonder if I'm in the very last generation of newspaper reporters.\n\nAfter hearing Jeremy Howard talk at a Milken Global Conference panel on robotics this week, however, I'm wondering if I'm in the very last generation of workers.\n\nHoward is chief executive of Enlitic, which uses computers to help doctors make diagnoses. His technology relies on something known as machine learning, or the process by which a computer improves its own capabilities. He's also a top data scientist, which gives him a much better view of what's coming than most people have.\n\nThis year, Howard said, machines are better than humans at recognizing objects in an image. Now here's the scary part. Compared to where they were in November, Howard said, they are 15 times faster in recognizing objects while being more accurate and using fewer computational resources. In five years, they will be 10,000 times faster.\n\n\"We are seeing order-of-magnitude improvements every few months,\" Howard said. Similar leaps are starting to appear in computers' ability to understand written text.\n\nIn five years' time, a single computer could be hundreds or thousands of times better at that task than humans, Howard said. Combine it with other computers on a network, and the advantage becomes even more pronounced.\n\n\"Probably in your lifetime, certainly in your kids' lifetime ... computers will be better than humans at all these things,\" he said. And within five years after that, they will be 1,000 times better.\n\nGulp.\n\nThe math here is based on current trends, of course, so it's not immutable. Yet in Howard's view, machine learning is \"the first truly exponential technology\" in terms of its potential for growth that never plateaus. \"Machine learning is about creating better intellectual capacity that can be used to create better intellectual capacity,\" he said. In other words, the technology involved in making machines smarter will get smarter too.\n\nBut wait, you argue, won't there always be a demand for human interaction? Personality? Performance? Love? All those emotional and intangible things that make us human?\n\nHoward insists that there's no reason machines can't master those tasks too. Think of the movie \"Her\" as a prediction, not fiction. \"How could it not happen?\" Howard asked. \"What's the constraint?\"\n\nBacking him up on this point were his fellow panelists Amy Webb, a futurist who advises companies on digital strategy, and Gerald Huff, principal software engineer at Tesla Motors. Webb pointed to a new app called Crystal that analyzes a mountain of data about people to help users write emails that are more in tune with the recipient's personality. Huff noted the work in Japan on \"cuddly things that demonstrate the signs of human empathy\" that can help care for the elderly.\n\nHere's a more sobering point.\n\nAccording to Huff, the federal government recognizes 535 major occupational categories. Only 20% emerged during the past 100 years, and those fields employ only 10% of the workers.\n\n\"We added four times more jobs in food services and retail than in every other high-tech industry in the last 20 years,\" Huff said. \"Those are the jobs we are creating. Those are the jobs that are very subject to automation.\"\n\nOf the roughly 145 million U.S. jobs in 2013, some 8% were in science, technology, engineering and math, Huff said. Every creative-industry job in the economy amounted to about 1% of the total.\n\n\"We haven't really had an economy that's created fundamentally new jobs,\" Huff said. Instead, we've \"shifted work into jobs that robots haven't been able to do.\"\n\nAnd thanks to machine learning, the list of jobs that robots can't do is shrinking.\n\nIt's easy to imagine entire categories of work that will be eliminated. For example, Huff said, there are 4 million people in the United States who drive vehicles for a living. Their labor will no longer be valued by the economy in the not-too-distant future of self-driving vehicles. Webb rattled off several similarly doomed professions, from banking and communications to customer service and marketing.\n\nSounding a less dour note, economist J. Bradford DeLong of UC Berkeley observed that humans have coped successfully for centuries with technology-driven changes. Four thousand years ago, DeLong said, about a third of all labor was devoted to moving heavy things, a job made obsolete when humans domesticated the horse. Yet the substitution of horsepower for personal muscle also ramped up human productivity -- a pattern repeated in the centuries of technological advances that followed.\n\nWebb was not so sanguine about the productivity gains to come, asserting that the algorithms that wipe out hundreds of jobs may create work for only a few people to babysit the software. \"I might argue that white collar or blue collar of the future is not in fact a collar, but a hoodie,\" she said.\n\nTo Webb, Huff and Howard, the key will be managing the transition between now and the time when there's nothing we meager humans can do as well as our robot overlords. Howard put it this way: As machines become better than humans at a growing percentage of the jobs available, there will be a shrinking amount of labor for humans to do that will have any value.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. Assuming we can agree on a way to spread the fruit of the robots' labor to everyone they displaced, the End of Work could usher in a Utopian future. So long, third shift on the assembly line. Hello, Barcalounger.\n\n\"Most of the world is doing really awful jobs,\" Howard said, although he used a cruder phrase than \"really awful.\" \"More like chopping celery than being a thought leader at the Milken conference.\"\n\nHe added, \"Meaning in life does not come from chopping celery.\"\n\nFollow Healey's intermittent Twitter feed: @jcahealey\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times", "Tesla Motors Inc. will introduce its line of energy-storage products Thursday night at the company's design studio in Hawthorne, California. Select Tesla car owners, utility executives and representatives of the solar industry are among those with invitations. The company will announce both a home battery and a \"very large utility scale battery,\" it said in a note to investors last week. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has been dropping hints for weeks, drumming up intrigue about \"The Missing Piece.\" Here's what to look for in the two-part announcement:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/593296401196388352\n\n1. Who Markets Home Battery?\n\nTesla has already installed roughly 300 batteries in California homes through a pilot project with SolarCity Corp., where Musk is chairman. Will SolarCity continue to be the channel to the residential market for Tesla's home battery? Or will Tesla offer its batteries to other solar companies hoping to pair solar and storage?\n\n2. Big Enough for Utilities?\n\nIn the utility market, a 1-megawatt system is widely viewed as the entry point for most storage applications. So what does Tesla mean when it says \"very large?\" \"In the battery industry, 5 megawatts or 10 megawatts is huge,\" says Haresh Kamath, the energy storage program manager at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, California. \"But for a utility, that's small. If Tesla comes out with a 20-megawatt system, that would be enough to get the utility industry excited.\"\n\n3. What Will They Cost?\n\nTesla is betting that its so-called gigafactory, currently under construction near Reno, Nevada, will drive down the cost of lithium-ion batteries when production begins next year. What is Tesla offering homeowners, businesses and utilities in terms of cost? Is the financing through a leasing model?\n\n4. How Long Will They Last?\n\nBatteries can store energy, but as the energy is discharged it ultimately is depleted. How long can Tesla's battery last: two hours, four hours? What's the performance warranty?\n\n5. How Will Tesla Approach Utilities?\n\nIn the utility world, you're typically either a supplier or a project developer. Is Tesla selling its batteries to project developers, or is it getting into project development itself and bidding directly on utility projects? Tesla has yet to announce any utility partners, customers or contracts, but Musk said on the last earnings call that the company has been submitting bids.\n\n6. Is There a Global Market?\n\nWith its cars, Tesla built a brand in the U.S. and then moved on to markets in Europe, Asia and now Australia. In the U.S., energy storage is a state-by-state market, with California and New York leading the way with incentives that support the industry. What's the international outlook for Tesla's batteries?\n\n7. What's With the Name?\n\nThe invitation to Thursday's event read \"Tesla,\" not Tesla Motors. Some observers are wondering if Tesla may drop the \"Motors\" from its name as the company moves beyond cars to the grid.\n\nRead this next: Musk Plots Energy Storage Fix Where Utility Industry Failed Tesla Rises as Analysts Cite Energy Storage Opportunity", "ET SPECIAL:Love visual aspect of news?

Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is starting a three-day visit to California with plans to check out some of the region's tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties, and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the state's governor.\n\nOn a swing through Silicon Valley Thursday, Abe will speak with Stanford University experts about innovation and also work to build relationships with tech firms and investors. The head of one of the world's leading car producing nations will also visit electric carmaker Tesla Motors.\n\nTraveling to San Francisco later in the day, the Japanese leader will meet with Gov. Jerry Brown and invite him to try the bullet train simulator that Abe is bringing, said Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman. Brown has pushed for a $68 billion rail project that would connect San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nAbe's California schedule includes a round-table with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and more. He will go to Stanford for a speech and meetings with Japanese foreign exchange students, followed by visits to social media giant Facebook, and the offices of Tesla Motors, whose electric cars are built in a nearby plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\n''This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,'' said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. ''This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.''\n\nThe 1,854-square-mile region, including San Francisco and its peninsula stretching south to San Jose, is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms which help drive the US economy. Today the economy is booming; last year the average annual earnings were $116,000, compared to $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses and 76,450 new jobs opened up.\n\nDuring his three-day visit to California, Abe will meet with Japanese-Americans in San Francisco and Los Angeles, encourage Japanese students studying in the state and announce policies to facilitate US investment in Japan, Ito said.\n\nEarlier in the week Abe made the Washington rounds with a White House dinner and a congressional address.

If he gets it right, Tesla Motors Inc. will have spun a significant second business off the technology originally designed for its electric vehicles -- and will gain a toehold in a business projected to generate tens of billions of dollars in a decade.\n\nNobody in the power industry has yet been able to come up with a cost-effective way to store large volumes of energy for later distribution. Tesla is making a bet that its huge $5 billion \"gigafactory\" currently under construction near Reno, Nevada, will enable the mass production needed to drive down the cost of batteries and make them competitive for a broad range of customers, including traditional suppliers of electricity.\n\nTesla has scheduled an event Thursday at its design studio in Hawthorne, California, to announce both a Tesla home battery and what it called last week in a note to investors \"a very large utility-scale battery.\"\n\nEagerly Awaiting\n\n\"Whatever Tesla announces on Thursday is just the beginning,\" said Peter Rosegg, spokesman for Hawaiian Electric Co., where 12 percent of the utility's customers have rooftop solar panels. \"Tesla doesn't have to go after the market -- the market will come to them. We're very eager to see what they have to say.\"\n\nTesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has its eye on a business that's poised for tremendous growth. As homes, businesses and utilities use more renewable energy generated by sunshine and wind, the need to provide reliable power grows. Batteries can be used to store electricity during peak production times, and then dispense it later when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\nMusk tweeted a teaser about the Thursday announcement: \"For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and (of course) ... the missing piece,\" he posted on Twitter Tuesday. Tesla rose 0.9 percent to $232.45 at the close in New York.\n\nGlobal Growth\n\nA January report from Navigant Research estimates that worldwide revenue from grid-scale energy storage may exceed $68 billion by 2024 as renewable resources multiply and electricity grid operators seek to balance the mix of generation assets.\n\nTesla is already supplying batteries to homes and commercial businesses such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. through pilot projects and a supply agreement with SolarCity Corp., a relationship that generated $2.7 million in revenue for Tesla in 2014, according to a recent regulatory filing. That's less than 1/10 of 1 percent of the automaker's total for last year.\n\nBut Tesla is thinking much bigger, saying in job postings that its energy-storage business will soon grow to billions in sales. Musk plans to combine the strengths of the company's patented lithium-ion batteries, which currently can run a car for about 265 miles (426 kilometers) a charge, with its expertise in power management software.\n\nGreen Trio\n\nMusk's green power ambitions involve three inter-connected enterprises: SolarCity, where he serves as chairman, the battery factory in Nevada, and the Tesla car business. With the move into energy storage, Tesla can help green the grid that fuels its cars while offering solar customers a way to store any excess electricity in batteries for use during hours of less sunlight and greater demand.\n\nAn even larger potential market will be utilities that have traditionally generated power with coal and natural gas.\n\n\"Tesla isn't just going to sell batteries to SolarCity,\" said Ben Kallo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. \"They are going to sell to project developers, wind and solar developers, and directly to utilities. The residential product isn't going to be a huge needle mover in the near term, but the numbers are very big on the utility side.\"\n\nTesla will face competition from other battery makers such as Korea's LG Chem Ltd., legacy U.S. power providers such as AES Corp. and startups such as JLM Energy Inc. It will have to navigate regulatory hurdles in a state-by-state market with varying degrees of subsidies and incentives for the technology.\n\nMoving Slowly\n\nUtilities, cautious by nature, have been slow to adopt storage on their own.\n\n\"Storage doesn't neatly fit into transmission, distribution or generation categories so it can be tough for utilities to justify investing in storage projects,\" said Brian Warshay, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \"Some utilities, like the California investor-owned companies, are getting into storage because their regulator basically told them they have to.\"\n\nIn Tesla's home state, a groundbreaking energy-storage mandate requires PG&E Corp., Edison International's Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric to collectively buy 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by the end of 2020. New York is also pushing utilities to use storage to relieve congestion on transmission lines and plans for the potential retirement of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. Entergy Corp., owner of Indian Point, is applying for a federal license to keep its reactors open through the end of the next decade.\n\nUtilities in California and New York are potential customers for Tesla. The automaker also has been in talks to provide its batteries to Oncor Electric Delivery Co., the largest power-line owner in Texas.\n\n\"Batteries really are kind of a panacea for the grid,\" said Don Clevenger, senior vice president of strategic planning for Oncor. \"They provide better reliability.\"", "Today Elon Musk will unveil the new Tesla Motors product line that are not cars. We already know that it will be batteries for home use.\n\nElon Musk took to Twitter end of March to announce a new product line Tesla Motors will unveil on April 30. It will not be a car he said. Back then it was already likely that the new products Tesla would offer are batteries for home use. Then a week ago Jeffrey Evanson, Tesla's head of investor relations sent an email according to Bloomberg to investors and analysts announcing a Tesla Motors Home Battery and a large Tesla Motors Utility Battery.\n\nThe email said also that Elon Musk will explain the advantages of the new Tesla batteries at the April 30th event in Telsa's Design Center in Hawthorne.

The new product lines help Tesla potentially increasing the sales of batteries beyond cars.\n\nTesla is already piloting the home battery in over 300 homes in California. The Tesla Home battery has a capacity of 10 kilowatt hours, which is enough energy for about 8 hours of use in a normal US household on average. This could though be enough to save considerable energy in connection with a solar panel system.\n\nTesla's home batteries measure 2.5-feet wide and 3 feet tall and have a starting retail price of $13,000. With subsidies this cost can be reduce quite a bit.\n\nThe surprise factor is gone for the Tesla event today.

Elon Musk needs to bring a good speech tonight to convince people why Tesla Home batteries are better.", "Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) wants those who can't afford a new Model S to invest in a pre-owned one, and the company's web site is making it easier and easier to do so. Earlier this week Tesla quietly loaded a pre-owned marketplace into its website allowing those less fortunate to pick up their own electric darling at a lower price.\n\nThe Tesla Motors Certified Pre-Owned program answers a lot of questions that have been plaguing Elon Musk and the rest of his executive team. For less-than-wealthy lovers of the Tesla Model S it offers something ever better, a chance to own one of the company's fabled electric vehicles at a decent price in the secondary market.\n\nThere hasn't been an official announcement of the launch of the Tesla Motors Certified Pre-Owned Program just yet, but the website works and cars and their prices are listed for browsing.\n\nThere are eleven cities and regions you can search through for a certified used Tesla Motors Model S including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Los Angeles, Hawaii, Cleveland, Chicago, Denver and Atlanta, Washington DC and Seattle.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nOn Thursday morning the least expensive Model S available on the store front was going for $63,650.

That's not a bad price for a low-mileage Model S, but it remains to be seen what kind of sales volume will move through the Tesla program.\n\nThe pre-owned Tesla Motors market is going to be a key ingredient for the business going forward. Elon Musk announced a buyback program for Tesla Model S owners that gives them a guaranteed price on trading in their luxury electric sedan.\n\nThe market place also answers questions about what a company like Tesla does with used cars. The complexity of the instruments in the vehicles, and the proprietary technology used, means that not just any mechanic will be able to handle retuning an old Tesla Model S for sale. The company also lacks a dealership network of the sort that handles official resales for other car makers.\n\nTesla Motors is aiming thoroughly for the high end of the market with the Model S, but the company's Certified PRe-owned program allows those in the mid range of the market to get their hands on the luxury car. That may or may not be a good business decision, particularly when demand for the Model S seems slack.\n\nElon Musk and his team seem to be having trouble stoking enough demand for the Model S in the run-up to the release of the next Tesla, the company's Model X SUV.

Whether or not it's successful, however, is a matter of much debate.\n\nSome analysts have contended that the battery business is a low margin sector that won't add much in the way of value to Tesla. Contrarily some believe that the market is a multi-billion dollar market for Tesla, and that the company is, in fact, a battery maker at heart.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\nFollowing this line of logic leads to the conclusion that the Model X is just window dressing for Elon Musk's most successful firm. That may sound ridiculous, but the narrative has been repeated in places like The Verge without any irony whatsoever.\n\nBrian Johnson of Barclays reckons that there could be an initial negative reaction from the market as investors \"sell the news.\" White says that's a pattern of trading rather than his own fundamental analysis. He still thinks the company is a Buy up to $190.\n\nBank of America analyst John Lovallo seemed to think that the Tesla Motors announcement is a cynical attempt to draw attention away from the struggling car business, and he reckons it may support the company's share price while Elon Musk and his colleagues try to get that business back into gear.\n\nOn a more positive note Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank says that the battery business is worth and extra $100 per share on top of the Tesla Motors car business. He sees the business a truly major opportunity for the Californian electric concern.\n\nThe Tesla press conference will be covered live from California, thought the 8PM PST announcement time may be a little late for those following Tesla from around the world. The stock market won't get a chance to react to the Tesla Home battery until tomorrow morning, when many analysts are likely to have published reports on the product.\n\nThe major thing to watch going into the announcement is the pricing of the battery. Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research reckons that the product will be available on loan from the company for around $15 per month with a $1,500 down payment.\n\nThe other important point for analysts will be the commercial targeting of the Tesla Home Battery. The device is going to be made or broken by adoption from businesses. That means that the industrial scale battery is likely the most important product that will be revealed this afternoon.", "US electric carmaker Tesla Motors is planning to make a big investment in charging infrastructure throughout Japan.\n\nElon Musk, CEO of the company told the Nikkei in an interview that all the charging stations will be either directly or indirectly solar powered.\n\nHe said, \"We'll buy utility power that's coming from solar panels, or we'll have solar panels on the charge station itself. There will be no impact to the electrical grid in Japan\".\n\nThe much highly anticipated Tesla announcement scheduled for Thursday night raised the company's shares by 7%.\n\nSo far, very little details as to what Tesla CEO Elon Musk will announce are known to people, but still there are major clues available.\n\nTesla Motors owner last month buzzed the internet through a tweet in which he said that his company's new move would be a new product line and not a car.\n\nAll the clues indicate towards what the company calls, Stationary Energy Storage Applications. In simpler terms, they're consumer batteries that would power homes and businesses.\n\nThese batteries will be available at a very suitable price and could slash electric bills by nearly 25%. Tesla's $5 billion gigafactory outside of Reno could play a big role in producing the innovative batteries.\n\nAs per the latest projection given by the company, the gigafcatory will produce battery packs for their automobiles. As much as a quarter of the plants energy will be used for the stationary batteries, it said.\n\nDuring the company's last quarterly earnings call in February, Elon Musk indicated that his company will very soon unveil a home consumer battery.\n\nAlso, Tesla in its latest shareholder report projected that it would start increasing in sales of stationary batteries in 2015.", "WASHINGTON/TOKYO, April 30 (Reuters) - In the 1980s when Sony and Toshiba were setting the agenda in the global TV and memory chip markets Japan was bristling with confidence as a hub of technological innovation.\n\nThree decades later, with Japan's electronics industry in decline, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is heading to Silicon Valley - the first sitting Japanese leader to do so - in the hopes of rekindling that innovative spark.\n\nFacebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg and Yahoo Inc cofounder Jerry Yang are among those Abe is scheduled to meet during a swing through the West Coast that follows a summit with President Barack Obama earlier this week.\n\n\"Japan will change. Let's create a country where innovation is constantly happening, giving birth to new industries to lead the world,\" Abe told a business lobby of IT-related companies this month, according to Japanese media.\n\n\"When I visit Silicon Valley I want to think about how we can take Silicon Valley's ways and make them work in Japan.\"\n\nCritics dismiss such talk as wishful thinking. Japan's once-dominant technology companies have long fallen behind the likes of Samsung Electronics of South Korea and Apple Inc.\n\nSony Corp, which invented the Walkman portable audio player, is struggling to come up with hit products. Sharp Corp, a pioneer in the flat-screen TV market, is seeking its second big bailout in three years.\n\nJapanese venture capital investments came to $1.2 billion last year, according to the Tokyo-based Venture Enterprise Center, a small fraction of the $48 billion spent by venture capitalists in the United States, a separate survey based on Thomson Reuters data shows.\n\nMuch of Japan's innovation is happening within the confines of large companies that tend to be plodding and risk-averse.\n\nBut Abe's supporters are optimistic the visit will have an impact simply by way of the message it sends.\n\nAbe has already stoked risk-taking by investors with massive monetary easing and government stimulus, the first two \"arrows\" of his \"Abenomics\" strategy, which helped to push Japanese share prices to 15-year highs. Promoting entrepreneurship is one target of the third arrow meant to unlock growth through structural reforms.\n\nWilliam Saito, an adviser to Abe's government who is accompanying the prime minister on his trip to the United States, said Abe has become more concerned about sparking innovation at home.\n\n\"I have seen an evolution in his thinking,\" Saito said. \"We just didn't keep up with global standards. Something is not clicking.\"\n\nAbe's schedule includes chances to rub elbows with Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, Microsoft Chairman John Thompson and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, among others. He will also meet California Governor Jerry Brown, where he will talk up Japan's high-speed train technology, eyeing a possible project in the state. Brown has made building an 800-mile high-speed rail system in the state a priority.\n\nNicholas Benes, who chairs a committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan that proposes growth strategies to the government, said Abe could be doing more to promote new businesses.\n\nBenes said that could include making it easier to hire and fire workers - a reform of Japan's rigid labor market that Abe has so far failed to tackle.\n\nEven so, Benes believes Abe's trip to Silicon Valley could go far in promoting risk-taking in Japan, where most university graduates covet a stable job with a big company and only a small number think about starting their own business.\n\n\"The most important thing is to simply change the social perception of entrepreneurship from being something where the dropouts have to go, to something that you might want to do fresh out of Todai,\" he said, referring to the prestigious Tokyo University by its Japanese name.

Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced plans to increase the size of its network of fast-DC charging stations, across Japan, to around 30 locations, this year.\n\nWhile talking to Japanese media, Nikkei on Tuesday, Mr Musk stated that Tesla owners in Japan will now be able to cover long distances free of cost as the Palo Alto-based electric vehicle (EV) maker is likely to increase the Supercharger network across the country.\n\n\"We're going to make sure that we invest whatever it takes to have people in Japan have a great experience,\" said Mr. Musk, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Tesla owners will be able to charge their cars for free, and even cover distances across the national main island of Hoshnu, said Mr. Musk.\n\nContinuing his clean technology motto, Mr. Musk said that all the Supercharger stations set in Japan, will be powered through solar energy, generated by solar panels or external contractors.\n\nCurrently, there are six Supercharger stations across the country, located in populous urban cities like Tokyo, Kobe, and Osaka. By increasing the number of charging stations, Tesla expects to boost vehicles sales. It will also solve the problem of \"range anxiety\" - a problem, which is prominent among electric car users related to fears about failing to reach their destination.\n\nBecause of this particular problem, Tesla Motors has to face a tough time in the world's largest auto market, China. Mr. Musk said earlier in February that Tesla China was not able to perform well, because of the \"misconception\" among people about charging problems. The automaker even revealed a version 6.2 over-the-air software update recently, which is designed to eliminate range anxiety.\n\nTesla auto sales and presence of Supercharger stations usually go hand-in-hand. This is because, it can take a few hours for Tesla vehicles to fully replenish their batteries from a standard charging station, while at Tesla Supercharger stations, it takes about 40 minutes.\n\nThis would likely boost Tesla sales in Japan, where Tesla's Model S sedan costs around 10 million yen ($84,000). By expanding its scale in Japan, the California-based EV maker, would likely pose a threat to top ranked Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM), on its home ground. Considering that Mr. Musk is a vocal critic of hydrogen-based fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which Toyota strongly advocates and showed this by launching the Toyota Mirai, we could see an EV vs. FCVs debate, once again in main auto forums.\n\nTesla stock traded up 0.85% at the closing bell on Wednesday, at $232.45. The stock has jumped 4.6%, since the start of the year with a recent gain in share price, because of the pre-announcement excitement for Tesla's new battery product.

On Thursday night, before an adoring crowd and a party-like atmosphere, Musk unveiled how he intends to do it.\n\nMusk took the stage at Tesla's design studio near Los Angeles International Airport, an audience of drink-toting enthusiasts cheering him on, in a scene fitting for an audacious dreamer renowned for pursuing far-out projects. Colonizing Mars is one of Musk's goals at Space X, a rocket maker that he also runs.\n\nNow, he is setting out on another ambitious mission. \"Our goal here is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy,\" Musk told reporters gathered in Hawthorne, California.\n\nAlthough Tesla will make the battery called \"Powerwall,\" it will be sold by a variety of other companies. The list of partners includes SolarCity, a solar installer founded by Musk's cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive. Musk is SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder.\n\nAs with Tesla's electric cars, which start around $70,000, the battery might be too expensive for most consumers. The system will carry a suggested price of $3,000 to $3,500, depending on the desired capacity. Installation will be extra. That could discourage widespread adoption, especially for a product that may only have limited use.\n\n\"I don't believe this product in its first incarnation will be interesting to the average person,\" conceded Peter Rive, SolarCity's chief technology officer. Rive, though, still expects there to be enough demand to substantially increase the number of batteries in homes.\n\nMusk is so encouraged by the initial demand that he believes Tesla and other future entrants in the market will be able to sell 2 billion battery packs around the world -- roughly the same number of vehicles already on roads. Although that may sound like a \"super crazy\" goal, Musk insisted it \"is within the power of humanity to do.\"\n\nIt will take a long time to get there. Tesla hopes to begin shipping a limited number of Powerwall batteries this summer in the U.S. before expanding internationally next year.\n\nThe long-term goal is to reduce the world's reliance on energy generated from fossil fuels while creating regional networks of home batteries that could be controlled as if they were a power plant. That would give utilities another way to ensure that they can provide power at times of peak demand.\n\nFor now, the battery primarily serves as an expensive backup system during blackouts for customers like David Cunningham, an aerospace engineer from Foster City, California. He installed a Tesla battery late last year to pair with his solar panels as part of a pilot program run by the California Public Utilities Commission to test home battery performance.\n\nAlthough Cunningham's home has not endured a blackout in the six months that he has had the battery, it's capable of running critical home appliances like lights and refrigeration and can be recharged by solar panels during the day.\n\n\"As long as a person has solar panels, it's just a natural fit for the two to go together,\" Cunningham, 77, said. \"I consider it to be a whole power system right here in my home.\"\n\nCunningham took advantage of state incentives that sharply reduced the battery's $18,300 sticker price under the pilot program. He still paid $7,500.\n\n\"The value proposition now is around reliability and backup power more than it is around savings, but over time that may change,\" said Shayle Kann, an analyst at GTM Research.\n\nThe batteries are likely to become more useful if, as expected, more utilities and regulators allow power prices to change throughout the day based on market conditions. That way, the software that controls the solar and battery system will allow customers to use their home-generated power -- and not expensive grid power -- when grid prices spike.\n\nMany commercial customers already buy power this way, and Tesla also announced battery systems designed for them, along with bigger battery packs that utilities can use to manage their grids. Analysts say these utility and commercial markets will probably be more promising for Tesla during the next few years than residential customers.\n\nSeveral businesses, including Amazon.com and Target, plan to use Tesla's battery storage system on a limited basis. Southern California Edison is already using Tesla batteries to store energy.\n\nTesla is building a giant factory in Nevada that will begin churning out batteries in 2017, so Musk needs to begin drumming up customers now. The spotlight may help Musk push policy makers and utilities to consider reshaping regulations so solar and battery storage could be more easily incorporated into the larger electric system, Kann said.\n\nTesla's ambitions already have intrigued homeowners like Mike Thielen, who installed one of the prototype batteries with SolarCity panels on his Redondo Beach, California, home last year. Although he hasn't needed the backup power yet, he has embraced the concept.\n\n\"I think it's brilliant,\" he said. \"I would consider upgrading to a more powerful home battery if they could figure out a way to get me totally off the grid.\"\n\nInvestors seemed unmoved by Musk's latest vision. Tesla's stock dipped 2 cents Friday to close at $226.03.\n\nFahey reported from New York and Houston.

The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high-speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Kim Lachance Shandrow has the story.", "\"Save us, Elon! Save us!\" a man shouted at the rosy-cheeked billionaire on stage. The billionaire was Elon Musk, a passionate futurist and crusader for renewable energy. The visionary Tesla founder took to the stage at the electric car company's Hawthorne, Calif., design studio last night to reveal the much-hyped \"missing piece\" of our future. And, yes, it's all part of his ambitious grand plan to save the Earth on his way to Mars, specifically from the environmental ills of oil and gas.\n\nAs predicted, Musk spilled the details at the glitzy show-and-tell about Tesla Energy, Tesla Motors' new brand of sustainable battery systems for residential, business and even public utility use. The offering -- a bold detour from the world of luxury e-car-manufacturing and into the mushrooming renewable energy market -- brings forth two products.\n\nThe first is the Powerwall, a home battery system, available at 10 kilowatt hours (kWh) for $3,500 or for $3,000 for 7 kWh. (Prices don't include installation.) The second product, estimated to cost around $13,000 a pop, is the refrigerator-reminiscent, 100 kWh Powerpack, an infinitely scalable, utility-class industrial battery targeted to mid- to large-sized businesses.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk's Ex-Wife on What She Learned Living With an Extreme Entrepreneurial Success\n\n\"The issue with existing batteries is that they suck,\" Musk quipped from the event stage to raucous woots and loud applause. \"They're stinky, ugly, bad in every way.\" Not only are his much better, he says, \"They're beautiful.\"\n\nHe has a point. They sort of are. The compact, 220-pound Powerwall models are stackable, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries encased in attractive outer shells that fittingly resemble shiny car hoods. After all, the tech inside is a derivative of the battery inside of Tesla's Model S.\n\nIntroducing #TeslaEnergy, a suite of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities. pic.twitter.com/HD7DbGRZPW -- Tesla Motors (@TeslaMotors)\n\nMay 1, 2015\n\nPowerwalls work with solar or grid power and provide backup power. Both versions, six slender inches thick, can be wall-mounted inside or outside of your house or garage. Available in white, black, gray, blue and red, the sleek, Internet-connected units are indeed pretty, but, uh, not enough to lick.\n\nMusk told reporters at a press conference held just before the red carpet launch party that he's confident the batteries hold the power to revolutionize energy consumption at a global level. He realizes, though, that that's no easy feat and might seem a little out there.\n\n\"Our goal here is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy at extreme scale,\" he said. \"It's going to seem crazy, but you'll see what I mean.\" Not as crazy, perhaps, as putting a man on Mars this decade.\n\nWe asked the entrepreneur and serial investor to describe why the everyday homeowner would want a Powerwall battery. He pointed to its ability store energy to help users survive off the grid whenever energy is scarce or too expensive. \"You'll have the security, freedom and peace of mind of knowing you'll always have power even if your utility goes down.\"\n\n\"This entire night has been powered by batteries. This entire night, everything you are experiencing, is stored sunlight.\" - Elon Musk -- Tesla Motors (@TeslaMotors)\n\nMay 1, 2015\n\nThe temperature-controlled batteries are especially beneficial for people who live in cold climates, he said, where grid power often fails during ice storms and other inclement weather.\n\nOr, if you're ready to ditch the grid altogether, Tesla's Powerwall can help you cut the cord, that is if you have solar panels. \"If you combine the battery pack with solar, you can go completely independent,\" Musk said, \"so you can be just free of the grid if you want.\"\n\nRelated: 8 CEOs Who Amassed a Fortune Before Age 30 (Infographic)\n\nAs for Musk himself, he's not living off the grid just yet. Smiling and rolling his eyes, he admitted that he doesn't own any Tesla Energy batteries yet. There are, however, several solar panels installed on his $17 million mansion in posh Bel Air, Los Angeles.\n\nThe industrial Powerpack has already gone on sale to select customers, including Wal-Mart and Cargill. As for the home batteries, they're available for pre-order now and are expected to begin shipping in three to four months.

The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high-speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat!By Diane Cardwell\n\nIn recent years, the fast-growing popularity of solar panels has intensified a central challenge: how to use the sun's energy when it isn't shining.\n\nNow, Tesla Motors, the maker of luxury electric sedans, says it is taking a big step toward meeting that challenge with a fleet of battery systems aimed at homeowners, businesses and utilities. The company's foray into the solar storage market will include rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs that can mount to a home garage wall as well as battery blocks large enough to smooth out fluctuations in the grid.\n\n\"We've obviously been working on building a world-class battery, a superefficient and affordable way to store energy,\" said Khobi Brooklyn, a Tesla spokeswoman. \"It's just that we've been putting that battery in cars most of the time.\"\n\nTo herald its ambitions in the field, the company scheduled an event on Thursday night at its design studio in Hawthorne, California, with Elon Musk, its chief executive, presiding.\n\nIn a news conference before the event, Musk said the consumer battery, called the Powerwall, would sell for $3,500, and was derived from the batteries that Tesla uses in its Model S vehicles. The device, which Tesla will start producing later this year, will be installed by licensed technicians.\n\nThe batteries will be connected to the Internet and can be managed by Tesla from afar. Customers can connect up to nine battery packs to store larger amounts of power.\n\n\"If you have the Tesla Powerwall, if the utility goes down, you still have power,\" Musk said. He added: \"The whole thing is an integrated system that just works.\" Energy and auto analysts have generally responded positively to Tesla's move.\n\n\"Elon thinks that there's a long-term gain to be made or a long-term play not only in electric cars but also in electric energy storage -- and he's probably right,\" said Karl Brauer, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \"There's a universal application for portable energy and storable energy that goes to everybody. It's really just a matter of getting the business model together.\"\n\nTesla's announcement comes as energy companies are moving in the same direction. Sungevity, a leading solar installer, announced a partnership this week with Sonnenbatterie, a smart energy storage provider in Europe, to begin offering their systems to its customers. NRG, one of the largest independent power producers in the United States, is also developing storage products.\n\n\"We have to be in this space,\" said Steve McBee, chief executive of NRG Home. \"If your goal is to build a meaningful solar business that is durable over time, you have to assume that that solar business is going to morph into a solar-plusstorage solution. That will be mandatory at some point.\"\n\nStill, the market is young and, some experts say, Tesla has the advantage of reach and scale -- as well as a $5-billion battery production plant under construction near Reno, Nevada, that it calls the Gigafactory.\n\n\"Tesla's not the only one doing it, but Tesla can bring it to a wider audience than most other people can,\" said Shayle Kann, a vice president at GTM Research, which tracks clean tech industries. \"Once they get the Gigafactory up and going, they will be able to deploy on a scale that no one will quite be able to rival. So they may have a cost advantage in that.\"\n\nTesla has been refining its storage business for a few years, working with a number of companies including Jackson Family Wines, the electric utility Southern California Edison and the installation company SolarCity, of which Musk is chairman and whose founders, Lyndon and Peter Rive, are his cousins. The Tesla systems are designed for different scales. The home battery, roughly four feet by three feet, would allow solar customers to have power in the event of an failure, draw from it when utility rates are higher and use more of the electricity their panels produce, easing reliance on the grid.\n\nFor utilities, they can help compensate for fluctuations from intermittent sources like solar and wind -- whose production can dip sharply or stop altogether -- as well as meet demand during peak periods.\n\nAnd for businesses, they can help lower demand for electricity from the grid, which in turn can lower costly demand charges.\n\nAmazon Web Services, which manages cloud-based computing systems and has a goal to derive all its energy from renewable sources, is beginning a pilot programme with Tesla in Northern California.\n\n\"Batteries are important for both data centre reliability and as enablers for the efficient application of renewable power,\" James Hamilton, distinguished engineer at Amazon Web Services, said through a spokeswoman. \"They help bridge the gap between intermittent production, from sources like wind, and the data centre's constant power demands.\"", "FOSTER CITY, Calif.

TSLA -0.01 % makes a bid to dominate the budding market for electricity storage, it faces lots of competitors and rival technologies, energy experts say. And plenty of challenges -- including driving down the price of its \"power walls\" to a level that will prompt price-sensitive consumers to spring for them.\n\nTesla announced Thursday that it is repackaging the lithium ion batteries it now uses in its electric cars to sell them as electricity-storage devices for homes, businesses and utilities. The battery packs are meant to absorb electricity when it is cheap and plentiful -- during a sunny afternoon for a house with rooftop solar panels, for example -- and release the power when electricity is expensive or scarce.\n\nMore\n\nHeard on the Street: Tesla's Battery Could Power Utilities Tesla Launches Used Car Sales Via Web\n\nSo far the market for electricity storage remains small, though growing quickly; last year about $128 million worth of such batteries were installed around the country, mostly at utilities, according to GTM Research, which tracks the renewable energy industry. Just 1% of the capacity was installed at homes.\n\nTesla plans to change all that. At an event to formally announce the battery products, Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, said it is \"trying to change the fundamental energy infrastructure of the world.\" The company's shares, which had risen by about 6% in the days before the party, ended Friday almost unchanged at $225.96, down nine cents.\n\nA few companies, including Sungevity and Sunrun Inc., plan to offer battery systems for consumers who have solar panels, at prices they say will be competitive with Tesla's. For bigger users, companies including Sunverge Energy Inc., Stem Inc. and Greencharge Networks offer lithium-ion batteries made by companies like LG Chem 051910 -1.09 % and Samsung, 005930 1.81 % with various financing options. Another group of companies sells what are known as flow batteries, which are more common for very large users like utilities.\n\n\"So many companies are fighting over a market that's practically nonexistent right now,\" said Haresh Kamath, energy storage expert at the Electric Power Research Center in Palo Alto, Calif. \"Tesla is betting they can produce a charismatic product that consumers will want to buy -- like what Apple did with the iPhone.\"\n\nTesla will have to sell eight home battery systems to equal the size of each battery pack going into one of its luxury cars, he said.\n\nEnvironmentally conscious consumers -- think: Nissan 7201 -0.68 % Leaf drivers -- are likely to opt for these types of home batteries, said Venkat Srinivasan, head of the battery program at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. But battery prices need to drop by about 75% before they go mainstream, he said. \"The big catch will be decreasing the costs.\"\n\nTesla says it has an answer for that, too: the giant battery factory it is building in Reno, Nev., with Panasonic Corp. 6752 -1.62 % , which makes the batteries it uses in its cars. Tesla says the new plant can cut 30% off the cost of producing batteries.\n\nENLARGE Tesla unveiled Thursday a suite of batteries for homes, businesses, and utilities, including a very large utility pack called a Powerpack. Photo: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nFor consumers, Tesla is offering a 7 kilowatt-hour system for $3,000 and a 10 kilowatt-hour battery pack for $3,500. Since the average house creates an electrical load of 2 to 5 kilowatts, the packs could power an entire house for a couple of hours. Or they could run essential household circuits -- a refrigerator, microwave, lights and fans -- throughout the evening when solar panels don't produce, provided there was enough sun during the day to charge up the batteries.\n\nThe devices, which feature a 10-year warranty, would be bolted to a wall near an electrical panel. Special controllers would toggle between batteries and solar panels, deciding when to put power on the grid or pump it into batteries. These same smart controls would also decide when to release power from the batteries.\n\nBatteries are only a small piece of the total cost of a solar/storage system. An integrated system includes solar panels, batteries and inverter, smart controls, building permits, labor and other costs that can add up to $20,000 or more.\n\nTesla's prices for installing batteries and other equipment are on the low end of the energy storage market's current range of $800 to $2,000 a kilowatt-hour, said GTM Research analyst Ravi Manghani. Those installation prices need to drop by half or more, to less than $500 a kilowatt-hour to attract a lot of demand, he predicted.\n\nBut there are other, less cost-conscious customers for energy storage. Businesses, which pay extra charges based on their peak demand for power, are already starting to use the equipment to cut their energy use and utility bills.\n\nUtilities themselves are also interested in bigger battery systems to help them even out the fluctuating flows of electricity from solar farms or wind turbines, keeping the grid stable or eliminating the need for expensive grid upgrades.\n\nUtilities think energy storage will become an essential part of the electric system in coming years because so much renewable energy is being added to the grid, said Mark Rawson, head of technology for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California.\n\nLithium ion technology, which Tesla uses, looks good today because it can absorb and release electricity relatively quickly and can go through many charge and discharge cycles without failing, he said. \"But I wouldn't say it's a silver bullet. There's still lots of innovation happening.\"\n\nWrite to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com and Cassandra Sweet at cassandra.sweet@wsj.com", "LOS ANGELES -- After demonstrating the merits of a Japanese-made bullet train to California's governor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is heading to a session with Japanese-Americans to promote expanded trade between his country and the U.S.\n\nAt the halfway point of his three-day visit to California, the Asian leader will attend a Japan-U.S. Economic Forum on Friday in Los Angeles where he is expected to announce policies to facilitate American investment in Japan, said Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.\n\nThe prime minister, who studied at the University of Southern California's School of Policy, Planning, and Development, will also meet and show support to Japanese students attending U.S. universities, Ito said.\n\nHe is scheduled to attend a reception Friday night, with former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and actor George Takei among the guests.\n\nOutside the economic forum in downtown Los Angeles, about a hundred people chanted and held signs demanding justice for the sexual slaves kept by the Japanese during World War.

This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, weak operating cash flow, poor profit margins and generally high debt management risk.\"\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Automobiles industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 561.8% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$16.26 million to -$107.63 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Automobiles industry and the overall market, TESLA MOTORS INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has significantly decreased to -$86.40 million or 166.58% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower. The gross profit margin for TESLA MOTORS INC is currently lower than what is desirable, coming in at 34.46%. Regardless of TSLA's low profit margin, it has managed to increase from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, TSLA's net profit margin of -11.25% significantly underperformed when compared to the industry average. The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 2.51 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio is weak, TSLA's quick ratio is somewhat strong at 1.02, demonstrating the ability to handle short-term liquidity needs.

In Philadelphia, for example, the rate per kWh is currently 15.74 cents to generate, transmit and distribute electricity to your home based on an average monthly usage of 700 kWh, according to PECO's Ben Armstrong.\n\nOf course, some things transcend the upfront and operating costs. Through Tesla Energy, Musk is \"amplifying its efforts to accelerate the move away from fossil fuels to a sustainable energy future.\" So, will he completely revolutionize the way people power their homes, businesses or even towns and cities?

But what app caused it and why? Could a compatibility issue with iOS 8.3 and a navigation app crash an iPad?\n\nDozens of American Airlines flights were delayed on Tuesday after \"a faulty iPad navigation app\" caused the tablets to crash. Despite Boeing 737 pilots' claims of all 737's being grounded and a system-wide outage, American Airlines spokesperson Casey Norton said, \"Initial reports on social media of a system-wide problem affecting a specific type of aircraft are inaccurate.\" Instead, \"several dozen\" flights were affected by the outage.\n\nAmerican Airlines told CNNMoney that it \"blamed a faulty third-party app, not Apple\" for the iPad glitch. \"Some flights are experiencing an issue with a software application on pilot iPads,\" American Airlines said. \"In some cases, the flight has had to return to the gate to access a Wi-Fi connection to fix the issue.\"\n\nThe pilot of passenger Bill Jacaruso's plane claimed, \"It looks like it's not just 737s, it's random, but no one's going anywhere 'til we figure it out.\" Planes can't fly without navigation and passenger and CEO of CurbStand Serge Gojkovich tweeted that his flight took off after American Airlines \"pilots printed the maps.\"\n\nIn 2013, American Airlines was the first commercial carrier to deploy electronic flight bags and discontinue paper charts. At that time, more than 8,000 iPads were deployed to replace the 3,000-page, 35-pound paper-based manuals in the airline's Boeing 777, 767, 757, 737 and MD-80. The change saved the airline \"a minimum of 400,000 gallons and $1.2 million of fuel annually\" and eliminated \"24 million pages of paper documents.\"\n\nThe announcement continued:\n\nAs part of the Electronic Flight Bag program, American's pilots use mobile software and data from Jeppesen, a unit of Boeing Digital Aviation. The FAA-approved Jeppesen Mobile Terminal Chart application is allowed for gate-to-gate use throughout all phases of flight and, with the exception of a few select documents, replaces paper operating manuals with up-to-date electronic information that is easier to access.\n\nJeppesen issued a worldwide NavData notice on April 28 as well as a one for the U.S. In truth, that may or may not have anything to do with the software application issue that American Airlines mentioned in a tweet. Could it be fixed by connecting to Wi-Fi? Those types of notices and alerts seem fairly common when viewing the history.\n\nThe BBC pointed out that \"American Airlines pilots use an app called FliteDeck.\" Although an AA spokesperson already fingered a \"third-party app\" as the culprit, the airline said it was \"still investigating the cause of the problem.\" So what third-party app glitched out and caused iPads to crash?\n\nJeppesen FliteDeck Pro is an app that is only available to \"commercial or military\" operators who also have subscriptions to \"Jeppesen's TEFIS or JMCS data.\" Below are iPad screenshots of the app posted in the iTunes Stores.\n\nThe app claims to be the \"first FAA-approved Airport Moving Map;\" its \"integrated distribution for mobile devices\" is included in Electronic Flight Bags (EFB). However, there is a compatibility issue between iOS 8.3 and the Jeppesen's FliteDeck Pro; it's listed under technical support with no \"estimated fix time from Apple.\" Other than not updating to iOS 8.3, or waiting for Apple to issue a patch, Jeppesen suggested a \"workaround for wifi+cellular devices is to rely on the internal GPS capability of the device.\"\n\nAfter calling Jeppesen and asking if the FliteDeck Pro app and iOS 8.3 compatibility issue caused American Airlines pilot iPads to crash, Jeppesen only said, \"We're not able to comment at this time.\"\n\nSo unfortunately the third-party app that is to blame for the American Airlines flight delays is still unknown.\n\nFortunately however there were no reports of people who tweeted about the American Airlines iPad glitch being met by feds upon landing. The FBI and TSA alert issued last week advised airlines to, \"Report any evidence of suspicious behavior concerning aviation wireless signals, including social media messages with threatening references to Onboard Network Systems, ADS-B, ACARS, and Air Traffic Control networks.\"\n\nThe alert, which listed other \"suspicious\" behaviors to be reported, was issued after Chris Roberts jokingly tweeted about hacking into a plane's Wi-Fi system. Roberts, who was detained by FBI agents after landing, was thereafter banned from United Airlines. Later at the RSA conference, when Roberts gave his \"Security Hopscotch\" presentation on IoT dangers, he reminded the audience that he is a one of the good guys and his tweet was about theoretical threats to aviation security.\n\nYet a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report (pdf) wasn't joking when it warned that \"unsecured connections between the passenger Wi-Fi networks and the avionics systems on some Boeing and Airbus planes could make it possible for a hacker to gain access to navigational controls and commandeer a plane.\"\n\nCybersecurity and aviation\n\nRoberts may not have touched upon aircraft hacking issues at RSA, instead talking about IoT dangers, but attacking aircraft systems is yet another potential Internet of Things threat. TAL Global experts in counterterrorism, infrastructure and information security did discuss cybersecurity challenges in aviation and the way \"aircraft systems and networks could become weapons of war.\"\n\nDuring the RSA conference presentation about cybersecurity and aviation (pdf), they looked at how planes, aka \"computers that fly,\" could be used for malicious intent.\n\nTAL Global's Lawrence Dietz added that \"terrorists may aim to exploit unknown security vulnerabilities in the future that impact public safety.\"", "* Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere under fire from opposition\n\n* Germany reportedly helped U.S. agencies spy on French targets (Adds French foreign ministry reaction, 12th paragraph)\n\nBy Erik Kirschbaum\n\nBERLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Germany's interior minister, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, denied on Wednesday that he lied to parliament about German intelligence cooperation with U.S. spy agencies, but remained under fire over a string of blunders.\n\nThe left-wing opposition and the media have assailed Thomas de Maiziere over his record as chief of staff in 2005-09 and whether he knew the German foreign intelligence agency (BND) was helping U.S. agencies spy on European firms such as defence manufacturer Airbus.\n\nThey have also accused him of bungling his last job as defence minister by failing to react to reports that the German army's G36 rifles do not shoot straight.

The results were sent to the German agency's headquarters in Pullach for evaluation, and then, to some extent, to the NSA, Spiegel Online revealed, adding that the NSA sent about 800,000 'selectors' to the BND in total.\n\nREAD MORE: BND helped NSA spy on EU politicians & companies 'against German interests'\n\nSince at least 2008, BND employees felt they were being asked to perform tasks they did not have the authorization to carry out, as they were not covered by the 2002 Memorandum of Agreement between Germany and the US, aimed at combating global terrorism, the magazine said.\n\nIt wasn't until 2013, in the midst of the Edward Snowden revelations, that an investigation into the spying activities took place. The probe revealed that 2,000 of the selectors actually violated German and Western European interests, with many used to spy on politicians.\n\nHowever, the revelations were not reported to the Chancellor's Office, according to Zeit Online. Instead, one of the BND's department chiefs simply asked the NSA to stop making such requests.\n\nKonstantin von Notz, deputy parliamentary leaders of the Greens, told Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper that he found it \"hard to imagine\" that the Chancellor's Office was unaware of the collaboration between the two spy agencies.\n\n\"The limit has now been exceeded. The chancellor must explain the situation,\" he added.", "THE man in charge of Cyprus Airways from 1981 to 1989, Stavros Galatariotis, is mainly to blame for the company's downfall, former board member Marios Eliades said on Wednesday, appearing before the ad hoc parliament committee set up to investigate the reasons behind the former national carrier's demise.\n\nEliades, who sat on the company board when Galatariotis was chairman, said that the former CY boss made a grave mistake when he decided to buy out the 20 per cent share British Airways owned in the Cypriot airline.\n\nDuring an earlier committee meeting, former company officials had argued that if British Airways kept its 20 per cent stake, decisions to expand the fleet, increase the workforce and closely work with the government would never have taken place.\n\nGalatariotis was also accused of not heeding to warnings regarding the liberalisation of the airline industry and that CY wouldn't be able to compete with other airlines once the island joined the EU.\n\n\"I urged Galatariotis not to take British Airways out of the picture. His response was that we were going to 'cypriotise' Cyprus Airways by removing all other elements. We also discussed the need to modernise and restructure the company to be able to compete in the free market. Unfortunately, the company board ignored all that at the end,\" said Eliades.\n\nOlga Eliades, who used to work in the company's operational department, was also present at the meeting. She told MPs that the company could not survive in a free competition environment because of the bloated payroll and financial decisions that burdened the company.\n\nAccording to her, CY bought their first two Airbus A320 planes at the price of $100m.\n\nThe former CY officials told the committee that the man who brokered the deal between Airbus and Cyprus Airways, Ioannis Christofides, received a commission but that the fee was paid by Airbus and not Cyprus Airways.\n\nFormer Central Bank Governor Afxentis Afxentiou, who was Finance Minister at the time, said that the blame should not fall on Galatariotis alone. \"There was a government and a board too at the time,\" he said.\n\nStatements at earlier meetings of the ad hoc committee heard that Galatariotis took over after a string of scandals forced the former board chairman to resign. It was also said that then President Spyros Kyprianou kept a close eye on the company and that Galatariotis used to visit him regularly at the palace.\n\nResponding to comments saying that people might have received kickbacks to mediate the planes' acquisition, Afxentiou said that he had heard those rumours before but added that there was never any evidence or proof.\n\n\"The offer made by Airbus was the most favourable of those submitted. The government at the time was faced with a dilemma. Either approve the fleet expansion or close down the company. A study was commissioned at the time and found that the company was profitable and that it could service its loans,\" he said, adding that the company should have been privatised when Cyprus entered the EU.\n\nAsked about the British Airways buy out, Afxentiou said that he was not involved since he was Governor of the Central Bank by the time.\n\nAfxentiou criticised MPs for setting up the committee, explaining that they lack the knowledge and experience to carry out such a task and that they should hire an expert.\n\nCommittee chairman, DISY MP Nicos Tornaritis, told the press that he will request technical support, noting that without it the committee report will be incomplete.\n\nCyprus Airways was grounded in January, after the EU Commission issued a ruling ordering the company to return some \u20ac66m it had received in state aid in 2012.", "Reuters\n\nBerlin\n\nGermany's interior minister, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, denied yesterday that he lied to parliament about German intelligence cooperation with US spy agencies, but remained under fire over a string of blunders.\n\nThe left-wing opposition and the media have assailed Thomas de Maiziere over his record as chief of staff in 2005-09 and whether he knew German intelligence agency (BND) was helping US agencies spy on European firms such as defence manufacturer Airbus.\n\nThey have also accused him of bungling his last job as defence minister by failing to react to reports that the German army's G36 rifles do not shoot straight.\n\nHe has remained silent as Ursula von der Leyen, a rival who is now defence minister, rubbed the salt in his wounds.\n\nOnce tipped as a possible successor to Merkel, De Maiziere remains a pillar of her right-left grand coalition government, with strong appeal on the right wing of her Christian Democratic (CDU) party.\n\n\"I follow the rules,\" de Maiziere said in a statement yesterday after Bild newspaper published a story accusing him of lying to parliament and the public. \"That's my understanding about the treatment of top secret information.

REUTERS", "German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiz\u00edere has denied claims that he tolerated American NSA spying on European firms via Germany between 2005 and 2009. Germany's opposition Pirate party says it will press charges.\n\nGermany's opposition Left party accused Chancellor Angela Merkel's government on Wednesday of \"lying\" for years that the NSA had selectively accessed data gathered by Germany's BND foreign intelligence service despite privacy laws.\n\nThis follows claims by German media outlets that the chancellery, which oversees the BND, closed its eyes to NSA spying on German and European firms to ensure future receipt of US counter-terrorism hints in Berlin.\n\nDe Maiz\u00edere, who was Merkel's chancellery minister between 2005 and 2009, said on Wednesday the accusations were \"untrue\" and this could be disproved using documents, which needed to remain secret.\n\nHe said he was willing, however, to provide explanations confidentially to the federal Bundestag's intelligence committee and parliament's special inquiry into NSA surveillance first disclosed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\n\"The sooner, the better, \" de Maiz\u00edere added.\n\nDocuments cited recently by Bild suggested NSA spying on Airbus via a BND monitoring station and Eurocopter, now known as Airbus Helicopters.\n\nGermany has nominally strict laws to ensure data and telecommunications privacy.\n\nDisclose 'machinations,' says Left\n\nThe Left group's deputy leader Jan Korte said the government in answer to leftist parliamentary questions had repeatedly denied knowledge of NSA economic espionage via the BND.\n\nGiven recent revelations, Korte said it was time that the government \"lay everything on the table on what it knew about the machinations of the secret services.\"\n\n\"That is not a petit detail but instead hurts parliamentary democracy at its core,\" Korte added.\n\nNSA 'outpost'\n\nOpposition Greens parliamentary co-leader Anton Hofreiter told the newspaper Rheinische Post: \"Either the BND under Chancellor Merkel has gotten fully out of control or the government has lied to the public.\"\n\nThe BND had allowed itself to be turned into an outpost of the NSA; a situation which must be stopped, Hoffreiter said, adding that personnel \"at the top\" needed to be changed.\n\nAn internal BND inquiry is widely reported to have turned up 40,000 so-called \"selectors\" or NSA parameters that could have been used to track European firms.\n\nPirates to file charges\n\nThe opposition Pirate party leader in the North Rhine-Westphalia state assembly in D\u00fcsseldorf, Joachim Paul, said on Wednesday his party would ask Germany's federal prosecutions office to press charges against chancellery and BND officials.\n\nIf there was suspicion of NSA economic espionage and that the chancellery was informed of this, then it would amount to treason at federal level, Paul said.\n\nGermany reacted with outrage in 2013 at revelations triggered by Snowden that the NSA was making internet and phone sweeps, including Germany and even Merkel's mobile phone.\n\nOrganizational changes\n\nOn Monday, government spokeswoman Christine Wirtz dismissed talk of resignations but spoke of organizational changes within German intelligence.\n\nVice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who heads the Social Democrats, junior partner in Merkel's current coalition, said it had become apparent that the \"BND leads a life of its own.\" This must be stopped, Gabriel added.", "Dreamed up in another age, the 747 was in the skies before Concorde, before man reached the moon, and when the president of the United States was a child. Boeing's most famous plane has been up there ever since, redefining the language of aviation as the original jumbo jet, carrying twice as many passengers as most other aircraft. Hundreds criss-cross the globe every day, and new 747s still slowly gestate on the production line. But it is now almost 18 months since the last order from a passenger airline, and the long flight of the 747 appears to be firmly in its descent.\n\nBoeing insists it has a future: even the president still wants it, for a revamped Air Force One. But, White House aside, its demise has been long-signalled after more than 1,500 orders since it first entered service in 1970.\n\nTotal aircraft orders have only broken into double figures once in the eight years, through a single Korean Airlines purchase, since rival Airbus delivered its first A380. The European manufacturer's bigger, more efficient plane promised to out-jumbo the jumbo, extending the distinctive bump of the 747's prow along the fuselage into a full double-decker.\n\nYet the A380's own mixed fortunes - 317 have been ordered since it launched but interest is dwindling - suggest plus-sized planes are out of fashion. Only Emirates, the deep-pocketed Gulf carrier whose Dubai base has been remodelled around its superjumbo-shaped business plan, has kept the A380 sales figures respectable. In its slightly sniffy annual forecasts, Boeing claims the widebody, or twin-aisle, sector of the aircraft market will be of dwindling importance, with the A380 unlikely to succeed.\n\nWhether both jumbos will be taken down by similar forces is a moot point: Tim Clark, the chief executive of Emirates, says the A380 chiefly suffered by being launched during the financial crisis, when few would risk such a new investment. On that Boeing might privately agree: the 747's early years, after it entered commercial service in 1970, were dogged by a weak global economy. And Boeing itself expects demand for its largest planes to pick up with the global economy.\n\nBut only its freight version, a windowless 747 with a hinged nose to allow oversized cargo on board, is selling right now - though only two were sold in 2014. In 2015, only the Azerbaijan cargo carrier Silk Way has bitten. Production of 747s has slowed to 1.5 a month; with just 35 more planes on the order books, which equates to two more years' manufacturing.\n\nBritish Airways was once the world's biggest operator of 747-400s, the longer-range variant developed in the 1980s, but has started retiring its fleet in favour of more fuel-efficient planes: A380s now, the upcoming A350, and Boeing's smaller 787 Dreamliner.\n\nBA insists that the 747's day is far from done. The plane remains \"the much-loved workhorse and backbone of our long-haul fleet\", according to a spokesperson, with 42 747s in operation. They will be flying for BA until at least 2020. Some have been sold in their entirety, others for parts; BA also retains some 747s as part donors for the active, ageing fleet.\n\nWhat will kill the 747? Specifically, progress in engine manufacture: the 747's four engines look increasingly redundant and expensive as reliable, efficient iterations allow longer routes and more passengers to be flown on two. Boeing's upcoming twin-engine 777X will carry 400 seats. The high fuel costs and narrow profit margins that characterised much of the previous ten years made an underoccupied jumbo economically unviable, and airlines have taken to scheduling multiple slots on popular routes to meet consumer demand, rather than one big take-off.\n\nAnother factor hastening the 747's departure, at least from British skies, is noise. In one office at Heathrow, reports of the death of the 747 are welcome. John Holland-Kaye, the airport's chief executive, says: \"It'll be great to have those replaced. It fits in with our plans for making Heathrow cleaner and quieter. I'm sure there will be a few people that will be a misty-eyed about it leaving service, in the same way as Concorde: they are one plane that you can always recognise.\"\n\nBut, Holland-Kaye says, the difference in noise between the 747 and a new plane such as the A350, which comes into service this year, is stark: \"It's far quieter - less of a screeching noise and that's really welcome for local communities. They have a sense for how much better life will be when the 747s have gone.\"\n\nHeathrow expects that to occur within a decade; meanwhile it is raising charges on 747s for its NOx pollutants as well as noise. Landing a 747-400 will next year cost around \u00a33,650 in environmental tariffs compared with just over \u00a31,000 for a 787.\n\nOthers will though mourn its passing. Mark Vanhoenacker, a BA first officer and author of Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot, has flown the 747 for eight years. \"As a kid it was the airplane I looked up to - literally and in every sense. The phrase you hear about the 747 from pilots is that it just looks right. If you talked about the hump in the front it wouldn't necessarily sound appealing but it works well. Joseph Sutter, the lead designer, was obsessed with birds, and I guess it looks like the head of a bird.\"\n\nHe says it is an extraordinary plane to fly, \"both for the sense of stateliness and the manoeuvrability, like an expensive German car. If you're talking about engineering, those are two qualities that are quite opposing and hard to combine. When you're flying it and turning, it feels like a very small plane, but you don't feel turbulence in the same way.\"\n\nPilots also enjoy its creature comforts: at BA the 747s are known as the ensuite fleet. \"Our little bedroom is within the cockpit: you can stick your pyjamas on and clean your teeth without anyone seeing you. And coming out the bunk when you wake up, it's a different light and you're in a plane cockpit in the sky,\" he says. A number of those pilots will leave the skies when the 747 does. \"Some captains probably think that to retire from the 747 is as good as it gets; I can understand that.\"\n\nIn fact, the fading dominance of the 747 has already impacted on Vanhoenacker and his colleagues, with pilots only normally flying one model and three long-haul alternatives now in play. \"One of the sad things is that if you wanted to see the world, the 747 was the plane: being a trained 747 pilot you'd be connecting to all the major cities. Our individual worlds will always be smaller, because the planet has been divided into four different plane types.\"", "Another day, another drone spotted near Dallas Love Field in violation of Federal Aviation Administration restrictions.\n\nLynn Lunsford, the FAA's Mid-States Public Affairs Manager, says that around 9:15 last night, an Virgin America Airbus arriving from LaGuardia Airport was 1.5 miles away from the airport's main runway when the pilot spotted a drone illuminated with green and red lights. The crew immediately identified it as a quadcopter.\n\nThe first officer told federal officials that initially he thought the quadcopter was on the ground. Then it shot \"straight up and above the airplane,\" the first officer reported, \"approximately 200 feet above the aircraft while on approach.\"\n\nThe jet was about 600 feet above Runway 13/31 when the incident occurred, according to Lunsford. But the flight landed without the crew being forced to take evasive action.

The width of the new creation is 17.5 inches, just a half-inch in excess of a Ryanair seat, while its \"pitch\" is 31 inches, only an inch more generous than you'll find on board the low-cost Irish carrier.\n\nBut ANA says its new seats - to be rolled out on domestic services from June - will offer greater support to help passengers maintain a relaxing posture and reduce muscle fatigue.\n\nArmrests and tray tables have been reconsidered, with various angles tested to find the right fit for all passengers, regardless of shape or size.\n\nThe design is \"in line with the airline's continued commitment to quality and comfort,\" according to the airline, and takes advantage of Toyota's \"high-quality craftsmanship and manufacturing capabilities, which have been refined over decades of experience\".\n\nSeat widths have shrunk in recent years, as has legroom (Photo: Alamy)\n\nThe seats will, for the foreseeable future, only be seen on ANA's domestic flights. It hopes to have 1,560 installed on six Boeing 767-300s by next year. However, the plans could give ordinary passengers hope that airlines are finally doing something to improve the in-flight experience.\n\n* The secrets of air travel\n\nAs Telegraph Travel reported last month, the majority of new aircraft developments are unlikely to make things any comfier on board. Boeing and Airbus are currently labouring away at fresh models which will reconfigure the traditional cabin, mainly by featuring more seats.\n\nIn March, Airbus received permission from the European Aviation Safety Agency to cram an extra 15 seats into the A320neo, raising its capacity from the planned 180 seats to an even denser 195.\n\n* What's the best way to sleep on a plane?\n\nMore intimate, though, will be the Boeing 737 MAX 200 - the catalyst for which has been Europe's biggest low-cost airline. Ryanair placed a \u00a37.5billion order for 100 of Boeing's new toy last December - with an option for a further 100 planes at a future date. But the Irish carrier's custom came with a specific request - that the 189 seats on the blueprint for the 737 MAX be increased to the round figure of 200.", "An aircraft carrying 44 Spaniards who have been evacuated from Nepal following last Saturday's devastating earthquake arrived in Madrid on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Airbus 301, which was supplied by the Spanish Air Force, also carried Spain's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, who explained that many of the evacuees were \"exhausted\" after their experiences.\n\nA second flight is expected to leave Katmandu on Wednesday with a further 71 Spaniards, as well as Irish, French, Colombian and Mexican citizens, given that Spain has offered places in the 200-seat plane to EU citizens and Latin Americans who have been trapped by the earthquake.\n\nOn arrival in Madrid the minister confirmed that a total of 498 Spaniards are known to have been affected by the earthquake, which registered 7.8 on the Richter Scale, and that 103 have still to be accounted for.\n\nGarcia-Margallo said he was worried about these 103 people, adding that a further 245 Spaniards have made contact with the Spanish Consul.", "Revenue at Spirit AeroSystems was up slightly and net income climbed 18 percent in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014.\n\nThe Wichita-based supplier said Wednesday that revenue for the three-month period that ended March 31 was $1.74 billion, compared with $1.72 billion in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nNet income was $182 million for the quarter, compared with $154 million in the same period in 2014.\n\n\"We are making good progress on our operational delivery, quality and productivity,\" Spirit CEO Larry Lawson said in a news release. \"We are aligning and strengthening what we do best to ensure we're fully maximizing our value proposition.\"\n\nThe company primarily manufactures parts of all Boeing commercial aircraft, including the fuselage of the 737, as well as parts for some Airbus airliners.\n\nLook for an updated story with additional information on Spirit's earnings later today.", "A second class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of passengers aboard an Air Canada flight that crashed landed in Halifax last month.\n\nWagners has paired up with a Vancouver firm to file a statement of claim, naming Air Canada, Airbus SAS, NAV Canada, the Halifax International Airport Authority, the Attorney General of Canada, along with the unnamed pilots of the plane as defendants.\n\nAnother firm, MacGillivray Injury and Insurance Law, filed a claim last week, seeking $12-million in damages for the passengers of the flight.\n\nLawyer Ray Wagner told News 95.7, there can't be two class-action suits.\n\n\"The court will determine which council group, if there's competing council groups, is best suited to manage the class-action on behalf of all the class members,\" said Wagner.\n\nThe British Columbia-based Camp, Fiorante, Matthews and Mogerman law firm that Wagners has partnered with, specializes in this type of law.\n\n\"We probably do at least 5 times more aviation crash cases than any other firm in Canada,\" said CFM partner J.J.

Codenamed HU7991, the inaugural flight took off from Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport at 1:30 am on April 27 Beijing Time and landed at Rome's Fiumicino-Leonardo da Vinci International Airport at 7:50 am local time. Rome has been added to the roster of Hainan Airlines' destinations in Europe following Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. As one of the gateway cities to western China, Chongqing now has its first direct flight to Western Europe.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 26, Hainan Airlines held a brief inaugural ceremony in Chongqing. When flight HU7991 landed in Rome, airport staff greeted the passengers arriving from China with the traditional practice popular in the aviation sector, of spraying the entire exterior of the aircraft just having completed the maiden voyage of a newly-opened route with water.\n\nHainan Airlines CEO Xie Haoming said, \"The opening of the Chongqing-Rome route has further improved our network of European routes, which, in turn, will provide a more comprehensive set of services to meet the growing travel demands of passengers who need to shuttle between China and the various countries in Europe as well as go a long way in nurturing economic and cultural exchanges between China and Italy.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the globalization process which Hainan Airlines has actively embraced and been constantly pushing forward in recent years, Xie Haoming added that although the Chinese economy has entered what has been termed as the \"new normal\", China's outbound travel and international business travel will become the main sources of demand across the aviation sector as well as the key driving force for accelerating Hainan Airlines' globalization process, in tandem with the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative being undertaken by the Chinese government.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Chongqing-Rome route, Hainan Airlines will plans to shortly open several more international routes, including Beijing-San Jose, Shanghai-Boston and Shanghai-Seattle. The opening of new routes will further improve the airline's network through close cooperation with international partners.\n\nHainan Airlines' Chongqing-Rome route is serviced by the twin-aisle Airbus A330-200 capable of transporting 260 passengers.

Instead, it will take four of the planes in 2017 and one in 2018. President Scott Kirby said the carrier is cutting capacity to match demand.\n\nOn Monday, Leeham News and Comment, which covers the aircraft manufacturers, reported that it wasn't just weak travel demand that explains the American deferrals. Rather, the newsletter said, \"American wanted to swap 787-9s to the smaller 787-8s (market demand), which is allowed in the contract. Boeing couldn't accommodate on the timetable American wanted, hence the new schedule.\"\n\nLeeham publisher Scott Hamilton said Boeing could not make delivery adjustments for American, the largest airline in the world, because too many other customers await delivery of the 787-8. \"The thing here is that the 787 is sold out until the 2020 timeframe,\" he said. An American spokesman declined to comment.\n\nOn Boeing's earnings call Wednesday, top executives trumpeted the company's intent to boost 787 production to 12 a month in 2016 and to add the bigger 787-10 to the product line, which includes a 787-8 and a 787-9. According to the Web site All Things 787, Boeing has received orders for more than 1,100 aircraft and has delivered 266 of them including 38 in 2015.\n\n\"We have now delivered more than 250 airplanes,\" said CEO Jim McNerney. \"Notable among the strong new bookings during the quarter was ANA's order for three 787-10s. 787-10 development remains on track for first delivery in 2018.\"\n\nChief Financial Officer Greg Smith added, \"We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators for the 787 program, as we further implement production efficiencies, while meaningfully increasing the 787-9 production, and managing through some near-term disruption in supply chain, largely around cabin interiors.\"\n\nStill, long waits for the 787 are creating opportunities, particularly for the\n\nAirbus A330neo. Without an existing order, \"You can't get a 787 until 2020, but you can get an A330neo in 2017,\" Hamilton said.\n\nMust Read: United May Love the Boeing 787 But Who Can Resist a 777 Bargain?\n\n1 of 2", "By Anasudhin Azeez\n\nLONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron praised India's initiative to become a global manufacturing hub and offered technological assistance to achieve its targets, including in developing its \"own world class fighter aircraft\" that is \"better than Rafale.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview to Asian Lite newspaper based in London, the prime minister said Britain is ready to help India's state-owned Hindustan Aeronautical Limited to develop world class fighter jets.\n\n\"The British offer of Eurofighter Typhoon to India is still on table,\" Cameron said. \"It will come along with technological and engineering assistance for India to develop its own world class fighter aircraft.

The BND would then provide related information from its surveillance databases. The NSA would send selector lists several times a day, and altogether 800,000 selectors have been requested, German publication Die Zeit said.\n\nThe BND realized as early as 2008 that some of the selectors were not permitted according to its internal rules, or covered by a 2002 US-Germany anti-terrorism \"Memorandum of Agreement\" on intelligence cooperation. And yet it did nothing to check the NSA's requests systematically. It was only in the summer of 2013, after Edward Snowden's revelations of massive NSA and GCHQ surveillance, that the BND finally started an inquiry into all the selectors that had been processed.\n\nAccording to Der Spiegel, investigators found that the BND had provided information on around 2,000 selectors that were clearly against European and German interests. Not only were European businesses such as the giant aerospace and defense company EADS, best-known as the manufacturer of the Airbus planes, targeted, so were European politicians-including German ones.\n\nBND officials took no effort to inform the office of the German Chancellor. The misuse of the selector request system came to the attention to the office in March 2015.

The project will give a fillip to the 'Make in India' initiative in the aerospace industry, with transfer of technology in niche areas not available here till now,\" said a source.\n\nThough the Army and IAF also require 384 light-utility helicopters, the NUH is different since it needs wheeled landing gear, sea optimization, foldable blades and small dimensions to ensure it can fit into warship hangars. The capability for anti-submarine warfare with torpedoes and missiles is also required.\n\nBut like the Army-IAF case, the Navy's earlier tender for importing 56 NUH was cancelled to ensure the project becomes a 'Buy & Make (Indian)' venture.\n\nIn August last year, soon after the Modi government came to power, the defence ministry had scrapped the long-pending acquisition of 197 light-utility helicopters for Army-IAF from abroad due to irregularities.\n\nAlong with HAL's ongoing project to build 187 light helicopters, which was sanctioned in February 2009, the ministry of defence decided all the 197 choppers would also be made in India with foreign collaboration.\n\nOfficials, in fact, say the 'Buy & Make (Indian)' categorization of the light-utility helicopters has the potential to give Rs 40,000 crore worth of business to the domestic industry.\n\nHowever, the decision also means the military's already long wait to replace their obsolete Cheetah/Chetak helicopters, used even in high-altitude areas like Siachen, will take several more years to materialize now.", "Bangkok Airways and India's Jet Airways have formed a codeshare partnership to synergise their Bangkok-Mumbai services.\n\nThe arrangement, due to take effect tomorrow for sales and effective for travel from next Monday, will reinforce the international network of both airlines and provide more choice for travellers between the city-pair.\n\nWith the code-sharing accord, the two airlines will practically operate as a single carrier on the specific route, with both complementing each other in flight availability on the sector.\n\nJet Airways currently offers three daily flights on the Bangkok-Mumbai route using a mix of Boeing 737-800 and -900 series single-aisle jets, each with 90-200 seats.\n\nBangkok Airways operates a daily flight on the same route with a 162-seat Airbus 320 aeroplane.\n\nThe partnership with Bangkok Airways brings Jet Airways' codeshare partners across the globe to 21, while the agreement with Jet Airways raises Bangkok Airways' active codeshare airlines to 17.\n\nRaj Sivakumar, Jet Airways' chief commercial officer, said the new partnership reinforced its commitment to developing a robust network across regions.\n\nPeter Wiesner, Bangkok Airways' senior vice-president for network management, said the codeshare would mean better frequency to connect Bangkok with Mumbai.\n\nWallop Bhukkanasut, Jet Airways' vice-president for Southeast Asia and Australasia, said Jet Airways and Bangkok Airways could extend their codeshare partnership to cover another route, Bangkok-Delhi.\n\nThat will be possible once Bangkok Airways launches such a route, he said.\n\nJet Airways now operates a daily flight between Delhi and Bangkok and going on to Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe airline is the latest in Bangkok Airways' code-sharing pool, which started in 2006.\n\nThe pool now also includes Etihad Airways, SilkAir, Malaysia Airlines, Air France, KLM, EVA Air, Qantas and Aeroflot.", "China Eastern and Qantas have offered a \"capacity condition\" on the Sydney-Shanghai route as part of their attempt to win over the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on their proposed alliance on Australia-China routes.\n\nThe offer of a capacity condition is contained in the two carriers' latest submission to the ACCC seeking approval for the proposed tie-up. The ACCC said in a draft determination in March it intended to block the alliance because it would give Qantas and China Eastern the ability to raise fares and limit capacity growth on the Sydney-Shanghai route.\n\nIn response to the draft determination, the pair said the ACCC failed to appreciate the vigorous and effective competition provided by other carriers offering indirect services between Australia and China the role of other airlines in the Australia-China market.\n\nMoreover, the competition regulator placed insufficient weight on the public benefits Qantas and China Eastern claim will flow from the alliance and disregarded the benefits to Australians that come from an Australian carrier being able to maintain an operating presence in China.\n\nAlso, Qantas and China Eastern said their proposed partnership would enable and expedite capacity growth on routes between the two countries, rejecting the ACCC's assertion that it would limit growth.\n\n\"The Commission's stated concerns ignore commercial realities,\" China Eastern and Qantas said in their joint submission.\n\nIn its draft determination, the ACCC's argued the partnership would result in \"significant public detriment\", given Qantas and China Eastern currently held about 83 per cent of all seats between Sydney and Shanghai, which gave them an \"increased ability and incentive to limit capacity and/or increase airfares\" on the route.\n\nQantas currently flies daily from Sydney to Shanghai, its only destination in mainland China, with Airbus A330s.

The Dallas-based carrier last took delivery of a new -700 in 2011.\n\nAirlines and planemakers are watching to see whether Southwest, Boeing's biggest narrow-body customer, will also amend its plans to receive the 737 Max 7, an update to the -700 that is due to enter service late this decade. The airline accounts for almost half of the Max 7 aircraft on order - but has fewer of those than the larger Max 8 model.\n\n\"If Southwest converts to the Max 8, then it puts a significant dent into the business case for the Max 7,\" said Michel Merluzeau, vice president for global aerospace strategy and business development with consultant Frost & Sullivan.\n\nBoeing isn't backing off from its plans to offer the Max 7, whose orders account for about 2 percent of the backlog of 2,715 of the redesigned 737s. The most-popular variant is the Max 8, a new plane equivalent to the bigger 737-800s that Southwest has been emphasizing in recent years.\n\n\"It's clear to us there is a place for the Max 7,\" Boeing marketing vice president Randy Tinseth said. \"It's something that's not going away.\"\n\nWithout more demand for the Max 7, Boeing risks seeing its narrow-body lineup shrink to essentially one model at a time when planemakers from Brazil, Canada and China are targeting the same market segment, according to Frost & Sullivan's Merluzeau.\n\nDemand for the 737 is now concentrated around variants including the -800 and Max 8 that share the same fuselage, with less interest in the relatively petite -700 and Max 7. Airbus Group, which has overtaken Boeing in single-aisle sales, has orders more evenly distributed between its two largest A320- family aircraft, Merluzeau said.\n\nSouthwest's support for the 737-700 has been critical. It provided input during the jet's development, was the first operator and relies on the plane for two-thirds of its fleet, even adding 45 used models while deferring deliveries of new planes. The airline is due to be the Max 7's initial user.\n\nThe carrier also has made clear that its future lies with roomier planes. Southwest is buying 170 Max 8 models and has rights to convert some of its 30 Max 7's on order into the larger version. The Max 8 will be similar to the 737-800, which Southwest flies with 175 seats, 22 percent more than its -700s.\n\n\"We really don't have a decision on whether we want 8s or 7s because the 7 is not available until 2019,\" Van de Ven said Tuesday.\n\nSouthwest has been taking the larger 737-800s to handle traffic growth at its Dallas home base, where gates are limited, and the expansion of its network beyond the contiguous United States to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n\"It's a very economical airplane for us,\" Van de Ven said. \"It's larger. There's a nice revenue increase on the airplane and it's minimal in terms of additional costs. If we think we have market opportunities that will fill up that demand, that's when we would pick an 800.\"\n\nBoeing's order book reflects the industry's tilt toward larger narrow-body aircraft.\n\nSince the start of 2011, Boeing has orders for just 36 737-700s, compared with 1,408 sales for larger versions of the current 737. If Southwest decided to shift all its orders to the -800, the smaller plane's backlog would dwindle to just 32 jets.", "PARIS: Qatar has agreed to buy 24 Dassault Aviation-built Rafale fighter jets in a deal worth 6.3 billion euros ($7 billion), the French government said on Thursday, as the Gulf state looks to boost its military firepower amid regional instability.\n\nFrance will start delivering Rafale fighter jets to Qatar from mid-2018 at the rate of 11 per year, the French Defense Ministry said on Thursday.\n\nTensions in the Middle East with conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Libya, as well as concerns of Iran's growing influence in the area, have fueled a desire across Gulf states to modernize their military hardware.\n\nThe contract -- the third this year for Dassault after deals to sell Rafale jets to Egypt and India -- also includes MBDA missiles, and the training of 36 Qatari pilots and 100 technicians by the French army, a French Defense Ministry official said.\n\n\"The president spoke to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, who confirmed his desire to buy 24 Rafale combat planes,\" President Francois Hollande's office said.\n\nHollande will travel to Doha on May 4 to sign the contract before heading to Saudi Arabia as an honorary guest at a summit of Gulf Arab leaders.\n\nThe Rafale sales have lifted French arms exports this year to about 15 billion euros and have been a welcome boost for Dassault, which had been under increasing pressure to sell the plane overseas after years of failures.\n\nThe French government said last year that it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets to just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 every year.\n\nDassault has resumed discussions over potential fighter sales to the UAE, the official said. A senior French diplomat said the talks with the UAE were \"going pretty well.\"\n\nA leading European defense analyst, however, said the Qatar deal could weaken the Rafale's chances of being chosen by the UAE, and boost the chances of the rival Eurofighter Typhoon.\n\n\"If recent history is a guide, now that Qatar has gone for Rafale, that should kill the Rafale's prospects in the UAE,\" said Francis Tusa, editor of Defense Analysis.\n\n\"It is possibly the only the good news for (Eurofighter) Typhoon, which has been languishing as both Rafale and Gripen have seen significant export sales recently.\"\n\nThe Eurofighter is built by Airbus Group, Finmeccanica and BAE Systems.", "BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel's government faces growing pressure over claims that Germany helped the United States spy on EU leaders and companies, and that a ministry lied about it.\n\nAnalysts expect the popular Merkel to weather the scandal, but her close ally, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, has drawn media and opposition fire over the \"BND affair,\" referring to the foreign spy service.\n\nA core question is whether his ministry misled Parliament when it claimed, as recently as April 14, to have no knowledge of alleged US economic spying in Europe, and of Germany's alleged involvement.\n\nGerman media have reported that US intelligence asked the BND to eavesdrop on the online, phone and other communications not just of terror suspects but also of France-based aviation giant Airbus, the French presidency and EU Commission.\n\nAirbus said on Thursday it had asked the German government for information on the reports and would \"file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nConservative daily Die Welt earlier said the wider scandal now \"has reached the chancellery,\" and mass-circulation Bild newspaper portrayed de Maiziere -- Merkel's former chief-of-staff responsible for overseeing intelligence services -- as a liar, picturing him with a Pinocchio nose.\n\nBild, which usually supports Merkel, labelled her \"hypocritical\" for having voiced moral outrage over 2013 revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had listened in on her mobile phone.\n\nMerkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert and de Maiziere have denied that the government misled Parliament about the surveillance activities, pledging to share information behind closed doors to parliamentary panels looking into the secret services.\n\nOne opposition member of the secret services oversight committee, Greens party lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele, demanded Thursday that Merkel's government come clean on what it knew and when it knew it, charging that \"parliamentarians can no longer believe what the government tells them. If it is indeed confirmed that her ... friends in Paris were knowingly spied on by the BND ... then things can hardly get any more embarrassing,\" said Stroebele, a critic of US secret services who has visited fugitive intelligence leaker Edward Snowden in Moscow.", "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. companies, including tech rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), were among leading spenders on corporate lobbying in Brussels last year, a Reuters review of new data showed.\n\nCompanies had until Thursday to update public entries in the European Union's newly revamped Transparency Register following a tightening of rules in January that obliges firms to register if they want to meet EU commissioners and senior staff.\n\nOil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) of the United States and Anglo-Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) shared the top spot with Microsoft, with reported spending in their last financial years of between 4.5 and 4.5 million euros ($5.0-5.6 million).\n\nThose figures were broadly in line with the trio's spending in previous filings recorded in January by researchers at anti-corruption group Transparency International -- the Commission itself does not provide comparative data with previous years.\n\nHowever, some of the other big spenders recorded sharp increases, including Google and Germany's Deutsche Bank, which doubled their expenditure, U.S. chemicals group Dow, which recorded four times the level of spending as its previous entry.\n\nNone of the companies listed offered comment.\n\nGoogle, subject of a high-profile antitrust case launched by the Commission two weeks ago after a five-year investigation, spent 3.0-3.5 million euros ($3.4-3.9 million), the same as Dow (DOW.N). Microsoft, which has itself been fined heavily in the past by EU antitrust authorities, has been prominent among those pursuing complaints against its American rival Google.\n\nTwo German companies were among those which spent 3 million euros or more last year. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) was the fourth biggest spender, reporting lobbying activity worth 3.96 million euros, and engineer Siemens (SIEGn.DE) spent 3.23 million.\n\nChina's tech leader Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] reported spending of 3.0 million euros in 2014. That was the same as it had previously reported as spending in its 2012 fiscal year.\n\nAlso reporting spending of 3.0 million was paij GmbH, a German company that sells a mobile payments app and which put itself on the Register for the first time in March. Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nU.S. engineering firm General Electric (GE.N) reported lobby spending in the EU of 3.25-3.50 million euros for 2013. No 2014 data appeared on its page on the Transparency Register.\n\nTransparency International's Daniel Freund said some changes in data filed appeared to reflect a recognition among companies that the Register now set more rigorous reporting requirements. Over 1,000 organisations registered for the first time after Jan. 27, when it became a condition for access to officials.\n\n\"The data quality seems to be getting better,\" Freund said, while noting that the Register only went some way to clarifying how much effort was going in to lobbying in Brussels and saying that the Commission appeared to have so far put only limited staff resources into scrutiny of the accuracy of entries.\n\nOther organisations, including non-governmental pressure groups, must also declare spending. Environmental lobby Greenpeace, for example, declared 1.0-1.25 million euros in 2013.\n\nA second element of transparency introduced under European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker since he took office in November is a register of contacts by commissioners and senior staff with companies, lobby groups and their representatives.\n\nTransparency International research found U.S. firms Google, Microsoft and General Electric, as well as European planemaker Airbus, were among the most active in visiting top EU officials since such meetings first had to made public in December.\n\n(Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; @macdonaldrtr; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "Virgin America Inc., facing a three-year stretch with no scheduled aircraft deliveries, may pick up new planes to fuel its planned growth during the lag.\n\n\"We're just kind of sniffing around the market to see what's available and when,\" Chief Executive Officer David Cush said in an interview Thursday. \"We're not in active negotiations now. We're taking a look at the market.\"\n\nVirgin America will receive 10 Airbus Group NV A320 jets over 12 months starting in July, and doesn't have another delivery scheduled until 2020. The carrier, partially owned by U.K. billionaire Richard Branson, plans to increase flight and seating capacity an average of 10 percent a year beyond 2015, mostly through additional planes.\n\nThat growth rate would require six to seven airplanes a year \"over the next several years,\" Cush said. Aircraft could be obtained from lessors, or Virgin America could find them itself and finance the purchase with debt, Chief Financial Officer Peter Hunt said on a conference call.\n\nThe airline isn't much interested in used planes, a strategy employed by Southwest Airlines Co. and Delta Air Lines Inc.\n\n\"If you look at Delta and other carriers, they are built for managing complexity, and it shows up in their cost structure among other things,\" Cush said on the call. \"We really aren't. That's why we're focused on taking new aircraft, because we don't have to worry about that complexity.\"\n\nIn 2012, Burlingame, California-based Virgin America reduced deliveries from Airbus to 10 from 30 set for this year and next, and delayed taking 30 upgraded A320neo model jets until 2020 through 2022 to focus on long-term survival over expansion. The airline began service in 2007 and held an initial public offering in November.\n\nCush commented on possible jet purchases after the airline reported a first-quarter adjusted profit of $10.5 million, or 24 cents a share.

For instance, in 2012, the craft spotted ice deposits near the surface at Mercury's poles. However, Messenger principal investigator Sean Solomon said, during a celebration of Messenger last week, that this wasn't the biggest surprise.\n\nThe probe's instruments found that Mercury is a \"volatile-rich planet,\" containing plenty of chlorine, potassium, sulphur, and sodium.

Harman International, which makes audio systems for cars, and Yelp, an online listings company, fell sharply after posting weak earnings.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 24 points, or 1.2 percent, 2,082 as of 3:16 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 215 points, or 1.2 percent, to 17,817 points. The Nasdaq composite declined 86 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,936.\n\nEARNINGS FLOPS: Harman International reported earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates and lowered its own forecast for revenue and earnings. The company blamed the impact of the appreciating dollar and weaker growth. Its stock fell $10.60, or 7.5 percent, to $129.65.\n\nYelp plunged $12.47, or 24 percent, to $38.91 after it reported a loss of $1.3 million in its first quarter and gave a lower-than-expected revenue outlook late Wednesday. Yelp said the number of visitors to its desktop site fell as more users browsed on smartphones and tablets.\n\nFALLING UTILITIES: The utility sector of the S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop of the 10 industry groups in the index after a big jump in bond yields on Wednesday.\n\nWhen bond yields fell earlier this year, investors seeking income bought dividend-rich utility stocks. Now that yields are edging higher, demand for dividend stocks is falling as investors move back to bonds.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.65 percent in January amid concern that growth in the global economy was slowing. On Thursday the yield held at 2.04 percent after starting the week at 1.92 percent.\n\nTHE QUOTE: Corporate earnings growth has slowed dramatically in the first quarter as the strengthening dollar cuts the value of overseas sales and the plunge in oil prices hits energy companies. Companies in the S&P 500 are currently forecast to report average growth in earnings per share of just 0.2 percent for the first quarter, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. While oil prices have rebounded from their lows in January and the dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies in the past month, companies and the economy are still adjusting to the big shift in prices, said Gina Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. \"As we go forward, things are going to look a lot better,\" said Adams.\n\nEUROPE: Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent. Germany's DAX climbed 0.2 percent.\n\nJAPAN, EUROPE DATA: Japan reported that its industrial output slipped 1.2 percent in March from the year before, not as bad as expected. As a result, the central bank kept its ultra-loose monetary policy intact despite expectations for stimulus.

Companies had until Thursday to update public entries in the European Union's newly revamped Transparency Register following a tightening of rules in January that obliges firms to register if they want to meet EU commissioners and senior staff. Oil majors Exxon Mobil of the United States and Anglo-Dutch Shell shared the top spot with Microsoft, with reported spending in their last financial years of between 4.5 and 4.5 million euros ($5.0-5.6 million). Those figures were broadly in line with the trio's spending in previous filings recorded in January by researchers at anti-corruption group Transparency International -- the Commission itself does not provide comparative data with previous years. However, some of the other big spenders recorded sharp increases, including Google and Germany's Deutsche Bank, which doubled their expenditure, U.S. chemicals group Dow, which recorded four times the level of spending as its previous entry. None of the companies listed offered comment. Google, subject of a high-profile antitrust case launched by the Commission two weeks ago after a five-year investigation, spent 3.0-3.5 million euros ($3.4-3.9 million), the same as Dow . Microsoft, which has itself been fined heavily in the past by EU antitrust authorities, has been prominent among those pursuing complaints against its American rival Google. Two German companies were among those which spent 3 million euros or more last year. Deutsche Bank was the fourth biggest spender, reporting lobbying activity worth 3.96 million euros, and engineer Siemens spent 3.23 million. China's tech leader Huawei Technologies reported spending of 3.0 million euros in 2014. That was the same as it had previously reported as spending in its 2012 fiscal year. DATA QUALITY IMPROVING Also reporting spending of 3.0 million was paij GmbH, a German company that sells a mobile payments app and which put itself on the Register for the first time in March. Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment. U.S. engineering firm General Electric reported lobby spending in the EU of 3.25-3.50 million euros for 2013. No 2014 data appeared on its page on the Transparency Register. Transparency International's Daniel Freund said some changes in data filed appeared to reflect a recognition among companies that the Register now set more rigorous reporting requirements. Over 1,000 organisations registered for the first time after Jan. 27, when it became a condition for access to officials. \"The data quality seems to be getting better,\" Freund said, while noting that the Register only went some way to clarifying how much effort was going in to lobbying in Brussels and saying that the Commission appeared to have so far put only limited staff resources into scrutiny of the accuracy of entries. Other organisations, including non-governmental pressure groups, must also declare spending. Environmental lobby Greenpeace, for example, declared 1.0-1.25 million euros in 2013. A second element of transparency introduced under European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker since he took office in November is a register of contacts by commissioners and senior staff with companies, lobby groups and their representatives. Transparency International research found U.S. firms Google, Microsoft and General Electric, as well as European planemaker Airbus, were among the most active in visiting top EU officials since such meetings first had to made public in December.

The European aviation giant has requested information from the German government and plans to press industrial espionage charges against unknown persons.\n\nAirbus said on Thursday that it had formally requested information from the government in Berlin about how the US and German foreign intelligence services, the NSA and the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst), spied on the aviation giant. Airbus told several news outfits that, following media reports suggesting Airbus was the target of industrial espionage, the company would be pressing charges against persons unkonw.\n\n\"We are aware that large companies in the sector, like ours, are targets of this espionage,\" the company said in a statement to French news agency AFP, after similar comments to German business daily Handelsblatt. \"However, in this case we are alarmed because there is concrete suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nThe company added, however, that it did not want to speculate on the information within this week's news reports: \"We have asked the German government for information. We will now file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nAirbus was reacting to reports in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper and Spiegel newsmagazine claiming that the NSA had asked its German equivalent, the BND, to spy not just on terror suspects in France, but also on Airbus, the French presidency and the European Commission. According to the reports, Airbus' Eurocopter helicopter subsidiary was also targeted - the French-based giant is a major player in both the military and commercial aviation markets.\n\nThe reports also alleged that the BND had informed the chancellery that Angela Merkel's mobile phone was being monitored, years before the information became public knowledge.\n\nDifficult week for Merkel, de Maiziere\n\nBild labeled the chancellor as \"hypocritical\" for her critical statements when allegations from ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden first suggested that her phone had been tapped by the NSA. At the time, she said that \"spying on friends is just not on.\" On Thursday, asked if he agreed with this premise, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker simply said \"yes.\"\n\nA French foreign ministry spokesman, asked for comment in Paris, said only: \"We are in close contact on this issue with our German partners.\"\n\nMerkel's close ally and interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, who headed up the chancellery at the time of the incidents, has come under particular pressure amid the allegations. As recently as April 14, the government told Bundestag parliament in Berlin that it had no knowledge of alleged US economic spying in Europe, or of German complicity in such acts. According to the media reports, the BND's satellite listening posts in Munich were used for the intercepts. Bild portrayed the Christian Democrat in one story with a stretching, Pinocchio-inspired nose.\n\nOpposition parties and even the junior coalition partners the Social Democrats, who were in opposition at the time, have been highly critical of de Maiziere, Merkel and the intelligence agencies in recent days. Merkel has skirted the subject matter of the scandal, instead saying \"now the priority is to completely clear things up.\"", "Rand Paul is trying to murder net neutrality. Is there a US presidential election, or something?\n\nEuropean aerospace giant Airbus is promising legal action over claims its top blueprints were stolen by German spies and given to America's intelligence agencies.\n\n\"We are aware that as a large company in the sector, we are a target and subject of espionage,\" the company said in a statement to the AFP newswire.\n\n\"However, in this case we are alarmed because there is concrete suspicion of industrial espionage. We will now file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nThe threat comes after days of speculation in the German press over reports that the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) - the German foreign intelligence agency - has been spying on German and European companies for the Americans since at least 2008.\n\nSpiegel Online reported that the BND's listening station at Bad Aibling in southern Bavaria was used to target up to 2,000 European concerns, including European defense company EADS, the helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter, and various French agencies. This spying was done at the behest of the NSA, and the information may have been fed back to American businesses.\n\nFollowing complaints in the German parliament from the Left Party and the Greens, the BND launched an investigation and found 40,000 suspicious searches against Europeans - some of whom hold senior business positions across the continent. The search requests were allegedly supplied by NSA analysts.\n\n\"The spying scandal shows that the intelligence agencies have a life of their own and are uncontrollable,\" said the senior Left Party representative Martina Renner. \"There have to be personnel consequences and German public prosecutors must investigate.\"\n\nThe German government is now being accused of lying about the affair. On April 14, in response to a question from the opposition Left Party, the Interior Ministry said in a statement: \"We have no knowledge of alleged economic espionage by the NSA or other US agencies in other countries.\" The government has since said it is \"now checking whether parliamentary answers in this case remain totally valid.\"\n\nIf true, the report is a severe political embarrassment for both Chancellor Merkel and President Obama. Merkel was furious when it emerged the NSA had been tapping her personal mobile phone, and President Obama went on German television to promise that spying was only carried out in Europe to hunt down terrorists.\n\nLong-time Reg readers will remember that these kinds of allegations are nothing new. Back in 2001 we reported on the ECHELON satellite spying system used by the Five Eyes nations (US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) and claims that it had been used to hoover up trade secrets.\n\nThe EU probe the matter, and in its final report found ECHELON existed, was illegal, and recommended that the UK pull out of the Five Eyes to show its commitment to Europe. So far the EU is still waiting. \u00ae", "The claims that Merkel's government knew about German state intelligence spying on behalf of the Americans against the country's own industrial interests raise disturbing questions about the integrity of German government leaders.\n\nThe apparent betrayal of German national interests by Chancellor Angela Merkel is not only evident over the recent industrial spying scandal on behalf of America. The slavish pursuit by Merkel of Washington's anti-Russian policy over Ukraine -- in contradistinction to her country's national interests -- also cogently suggests that the chancellor is serving a foreign master.\n\nRecent reports that German state intelligence was spying on behalf of the Americans against the country's own industrial interests are bad enough. But then added to that are claims that the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel knew about the espionage -- and turned a blind eye.\n\nThe news story in question refers to reports in the German media last week of how Germany's Federal Intelligence (BND) collaborated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) in spying on multinational European defence companies, including EADS and Eurocopter. The specific eavesdropping on these firms -- in which Germany has major national economic interests -- reportedly dates back to 2008. It is inconceivable that the highest levels of German government, including Chancellor Merkel -- did not know about the industrial espionage. Yet Merkel appears to have countenanced the illegal activity, even though such activity would have vitiated German national interests, affording advantage to American competitors.\n\nFirst of all, the idea that German state intelligence is thoroughly penetrated by American secret agencies is not an outlandish theory.\n\nFar from it. The functioning of the BND as part of the American intelligence apparatus has been going on for decades, since the US oversaw the postwar rehabilitation of defeated Nazi Germany. The Americans and the British wove German intelligence -- much of it inherited from the Nazi war machine -- into their European-wide operations. German historian Josef Foschepoth and expert on postwar allied intelligence operations says that the West German government signed a secret pact with Washington and London, in 1968, known as the NATO Status of Forces Agreement. That pact mandates \"intensive collaboration\" and continues to this day -- more than two decades since the reunification of Germany.\n\nIn essence, the American secret services like the NSA and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have a free hand to carry out massive surveillance in Germany against whomever they want, whether private citizens or industrial companies. And all with the help of German state intelligence and the federal government.\n\nThe telling thing is how puny and pusillanimous was the reaction from the German authorities to this disclosure of illicit spying by Washington. Apart from an initial bout of handwringing by Merkel and other Berlin figures, the whole scandal was quickly swept under the carpet as if it never happened. That suggests that the German government was already well aware of its compromised, subservient relation to Washington, as manifested by intrusive access to communications at the highest level.\n\nAs noted above such a master-servant relationship between the US and Germany was a fundamental tenet of the postwar American reconstitution of that country, and the predominant role devolved to NATO by Washington over European security affairs. The German government was apprised of, indeed was a willing party to, its subservient role to American intelligence and the free hand given to the latter. So, when the rest of the world learnt of American government spying on Merkel back in 2013 from the Edward Snowden's leaks, perhaps the least surprised person would have been Merkel and her administration. Hence the meek response from Berlin towards Washington and, to any objective observer, its shockingly invasive conduct against German \"allies\".\n\nFurther explosive testimony on the systematic penetration of American intelligence of German institutions came in recent months from former senior newspaper editor, Udo Ulfkotte. In several media interviews and in a best-selling book, Ulfkotte tells how German journalists and politicians are routinely recruited as CIA assets to spin stories or promulgate policies that are aimed at serving the geopolitical interests of Washington, not the interests of the German people. The former editor of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung -- one of Germany's best-known newspapers -- confessed that he was one of the CIA's assets for many years, publishing stories that he knew to be false and which were damaging to international relations, and in particular antagonistic towards Russia.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the same domineering relation does not hold between US secret government and other European counterparts.\n\nBut given Germany's central importance to the economy and policies of the European Union and its historical growing ties with Russia since the Second World War, Berlin would be a prime target for the Americans to exert leverage for their geopolitical advantage.\n\nWhen we look at German policy towards Russia over the Ukraine conflict it seems absurd on the face of it. German small businesses, major export companies and farmers are losing heavily from the Western sanctions imposed on Russia and from Moscow's counter-sanctions. Polls also indicate German public opinion is not supportive of the hostile policies, policies that have emanated from Washington and which the European allies have adopted, largely at the behest of Berlin.\n\nThis week Chancellor Merkel warned that EU sanctions against Russia may be extended if Russia does not \"fulfil the Minsk ceasefire accords\".\n\nMerkel's logic is risible. There is no evidence that Russia has subverted Ukraine or has a military presence there. It was Russian President Vladimir Putin who helped broker the Minsk ceasefire. All the evidence, including reports by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, points to the truce being breached by the Western-backed Kiev regime. It is the Kiev regime that is not fulfilling its commitments under the Minsk accords, yet Merkel chooses, illogically, to castigate Russia.\n\nMoreover, it is Washington that has sent hundreds of its troops into Ukraine in the past week to carry out military exercises with the armed forces of non-NATO member Ukraine. Why is Merkel so silent when it comes to censuring Washington and its puppet-regime in Kiev over what are egregious threats to peace? Her silence is incriminating.\n\nMerkel's take on Ukraine and Russia is so completely at odds with reality and against the national interests of her own people, the question of just who is she serving comes to the fore. The recent industrial spying scandal on German companies carried out by the US -- with German federal collusion -- and the long-time surveillance of the chancellor's personal life points to Merkel being a compromised leader. Or, in a word: bought.", "As the conflict in Yemen intensifies, fully armed Royal Saudi Air Force F-15Cs are caught on video intercepting a civilian Airbus A310. The Mahan Air jet was en route from Iran to Yemen, supposedly on a relief mission to deliver humanitarian aid. Apparently the Saudis didn't believe that.\n\nIranians claim that proper clearance was acquired for the flight to Yemen via Oman and pilots ignored Saudi radio communications demanding the aircraft land at an alternate airport, one that just so happens to be under Saudi control.\n\nDespite the imminent threat of multiple F-15s proudly displaying their armament of AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X air-to-air missiles, along with range extending drop tanks, the flight continued to the airport in Sana'a under the watchful eye of the Saudi escort.\n\nBrigadier General Ahmed Asseri, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, told Reuters that the airport was bombed after the Iranian aircraft refused to coordinate with the coalition and the pilot ignored orders to divert. Iran's state news agency IRNA said the plane was carrying food and medical aid to the citizens of Sana'a, Yemen's capital.\n\nThe remains of a Felix Airways plane after it was destroyed by an air strike at Sanaa International airport, Yemen pic.twitter.com/TqTzWlOYs2\n\nApril 29, 2015\n\nIt is reported that Saudi jets bombed the runway at the Sana'a airport rendering it unusable. As a result, Iranian flight had to finally turn around and return to Iran. The bombing set ablaze at least one cargo aircraft as well as one civilian airliner.\n\nFour of these massive holes .. were the result of the saudi airstrikes that targeted the Sanaa airport runway #Yemen pic.twitter.com/pncXHlPV8z\n\nApril 29, 2015\n\nExtensive damage to the airport has also restricted other humanitarian flights to access the area. As the civil war rages on and the impoverished country sinks deeper into a humanitarian emergency, and massive holes destroying the airport in the heart of the region only serves to hamper further relief efforts. It also appears that the airport in Hodeida, near Yemen's western coast along the Red Sea, was also bombed, with its runways left cratered.\n\nWe are trying to confirm that both airports were in fact attacked by the Saudi-led coalition jets in an attempt to stop the Iranian cargo jet from landing. Currently, the timeline is unclear so it remains uncertain if the bombing of the airport in Hodeida is directly related to the intercept and the subsequent bombing of the main airport in Sana'a.\n\nHodeida is less than a hundred miles away from Sana'a, and if it was operational at the time the Iranian flight originally departed, it could very likely have been a secondary divert field, deep in Houthi controlled territory, for which the Airbus could land and unload its cargo, whatever that cargo may have truly been.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been leading air strikes targeting Shiite Houthi militia for the last month. The Houthi militia controls most of western Yemen including Sana'a and have a strong relationship with Iran.", "Chancellor Angela Merkel's government faces growing pressure over claims that Germany helped the United States spy on EU leaders and companies, and that a ministry lied about it.\n\nAnalysts expect the popular Merkel to weather the scandal, but her close ally, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, has drawn media and opposition fire over the \"BND affair\", referring to the foreign spy service.\n\nA core question is whether his ministry misled parliament when it claimed, as recently as April 14, to have no knowledge of alleged US economic spying in Europe, and of Germany's alleged involvement.\n\nGerman media have reported that US intelligence asked the BND to eavesdrop on the online, phone and other communications not just of terror suspects but also of France-based aviation giant Airbus, the French presidency and EU Commission.\n\nAirbus said on Thursday it had asked the German government for information on the reports and would \"file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage\".\n\nConservative daily Die Welt earlier said the wider scandal now \"has reached the chancellery\", and mass-circulation Bild newspaper portrayed de Maiziere -- Merkel's former chief-of-staff responsible for overseeing intelligence services -- as a liar, picturing him with a Pinocchio nose.\n\nBild, which usually supports Merkel, labelled her \"hypocritical\" for having voiced moral outrage over 2013 revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had listened in on her mobile phone.\n\nMerkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert and de Maiziere have denied that the government misled parliament about the surveillance activities, pledging to share information behind closed doors to parliamentary panels looking into the secret services.\n\nOne opposition member of the secret services oversight committee, Greens party lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele, demanded Thursday that Merkel's government come clean on what it knew and when it knew it, charging that \"parliamentarians can no longer believe what the government tells them.\"\n\n\"If it is indeed confirmed that her ... friends in Paris were knowingly spied on by the BND ... then things can hardly get any more embarrassing,\" said Stroebele, a critic of US secret services who has visited fugitive intelligence leaker Edward Snowden in Moscow.\n\n- 'Political espionage' -\n\nMerkel, known to sit out scandals, has only said that \"now the priority is to completely clear things up\", days after her press team acknowledged \"technical and organisational deficits within the BND\".\n\nIn a string of allegations, Bild and news weekly Spiegel said the NSA had asked the BND to use a monitoring station at Bad Aibling in the southern state of Bavaria to sweep phone numbers and email addresses, with defence group EADS, now known as Airbus Group, among the targets.\n\nOn Thursday the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the BND had also engaged in \"political espionage\" when it helped the NSA snoop on \"top officials at the French foreign ministry, the Elysee Palace and European Commission\", citing a source with knowledge of BND procedures.\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said \"this must be cleared up by German authorities and parliament ... Then we will see.\"\n\nOpposition parties the Greens and the far-left Linke have seized on the issue, with the Linke's Sahra Wagenknecht calling for de Maiziere's resignation.\n\nPolitical observers, however, said that so far they saw little threat to Merkel, who has won three terms and is ranked as Germany's most popular politician in polls.\n\n\"It's natural the opposition will attack ... but the question is: can this in fact be cleared up?,\" said political scientist Oskar Niedermayer of Berlin's Free University.\n\n\"The experience so far with the NSA issue, including in the 2013 election campaign, has been that generally the population isn't very concerned by this.\"\n\nHis colleague Gero Neugebauer said the small leftist opposition was too weak to capitalise on the issue. Merkel, he said, would only face a threat in the unlikely event that her conservative party felt she could not win another term in 2017 elections.", "European aviation and aeronautics giant Airbus said Thursday it would file a criminal complaint against persons unknown following German media reports it had become a target of US industrial espionage.\n\n\"We are aware that as a large company in the sector, we are a target and subject of espionage,\" the company said in a statement to AFP. \"However, in this case we are alarmed because there is concrete suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nFollowing the recent media reports, on which the company said it did not want to speculate, \"we have asked the German government for information,\" said the German-language statement.\n\n\"We will now file a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of industrial espionage.\"\n\nGermany's Bild daily said Monday, citing intelligence agency documents, that US spy agencies had targeted Airbus and Eurocopter, now called Airbus Helicopters, as well as other companies for years, and that the German government had known about it since 2008.\n\nThe US National Security Agency (NSA) had spied or sought to spy on businesses in Europe via the German BND foreign intelligence agency's monitoring station at Bad Aibling in southern Bavaria state, the mass circulation newspaper said.\n\nThe Bild report, and other news reports of such alleged intelligence cooperation, have been embarrassing for the German government which has always portrayed itself as a victim of spying by its allies, notably the United States.\n\nOn Thursday the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, citing a source with knowledge of BND procedures, said the BND had also engaged in \"political espionage\" when it helped the NSA snoop on \"top officials at the French foreign ministry, the Elysee Palace and European Commission\".", "NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks traded lower Thursday as investors assessed the latest corporate earnings. Harman International, which makes audio systems for cars, and Yelp, an online listings company, fell sharply after posting weak earnings.\n\nTreasury notes continued their recent slump, pushing bond yields higher, after a Labor Department report showed that the number of Americans seeking unemployment aid plummeted to the lowest level in 15 years last week.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 12 points, or 0.6 percent, 2,094 as of 1:46 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 102 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,929 points. The Nasdaq composite declined 54 points, or 1 percent, to 4,969.\n\nEARNINGS FLOPS: Harman International reported earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates and lowered its own forecast for revenue and earnings. The company blamed the impact of the appreciating dollar and weaker growth. Its stock fell $9.41, or 6.7 percent, to $130.81.\n\nYelp plunged $11.73, or 23 percent, to $39.57 after it reported a loss of $1.3 million in its first quarter and gave a lower-than-expected revenue outlook late Wednesday. Yelp said the number of visitors to its desktop site fell as more users browsed on smartphones and tablets.\n\nRISING YIELDS, FALLING UTILITIES: Bond yields continued to rise from their recent lows, pushing down utility stocks. The utility sector of the S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop of the 10 industry groups in the index.\n\nWhen bond yields fell earlier this year, investors seeking income bought dividend-rich utility stocks. Now that yields are edging higher, demand for dividend stocks is falling as investors move back to bonds.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.65 percent in January amid concern that growth in the global economy was slowing. On Thursday the yield climbed to 2.07 percent from 2.04 percent the day before.\n\nTHE QUOTE: Corporate earnings growth has slowed dramatically in the first quarter as the strengthening dollar cuts the value of overseas sales and the plunge in oil prices hits energy companies. Companies in the S&P 500 are currently forecast to report average growth in earnings per share of just 0.2 percent for the first quarter, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. While oil prices have rebounded from their lows in January and the dollar has weakened against the euro and other currencies in the past month, companies and the economy are still adjusting to the big shift in prices, said Gina Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. \"As we go forward, things are going to look a lot better,\" said Adams.\n\nEUROPE: Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent. Germany's DAX climbed 0.2 percent.\n\nJAPAN, EUROPE DATA: Japan reported that its industrial output slipped 1.2 percent in March from the year before, not as bad as expected. As a result, the central bank kept its ultra-loose monetary policy intact despite expectations for stimulus. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda remains upbeat about the prospects for a moderate recovery, despite halting progress toward his 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nIn Europe, inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro edged up from minus 0.1 percent to zero in April, ending a four-month spell of falling prices. That's an encouraging sign that the risk of a long-term drop in prices, a damaging phenomenon called deflation, is easing.\n\nMORE EARNINGS: European corporate earnings reports were mixed, with good figures from Shell and Airbus but a disappointing performance from Nokia. The Finnish technology company's shares plummeted 9 percent after it said the profitability at its main networks division was not as good as hoped.\n\nCURRENCIES: The euro rose to $1.1177 from $1.1114 the day before. The dollar rose to 119.78 yen from 119.01 yen.\n\nENERGY: U.S. benchmark crude oil increased 75 cents to $59.31 a barrel in New York. Brent crude rose 75 cents to $66.60 a barrel in London.", "The first supplies of food aid began reaching remote, earthquake-shattered mountain villages in Nepal, while thousands clamored to board buses out of Kathmandu, either to check on rural relatives or for fear of spending...More >>\n\nPolice say a woman in her 20s has been rescued five days after Nepal's massive earthquake.\n\nA police official identified the woman as Krishna Devi Khadka and said she was rescued Thursday evening in an area near Kathmandu's main bus terminal.\n\nThe official asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a 15-year-old boy, Pemba Tamang, was pulled, dazed and dusty, from the wreckage of a seven-story building elsewhere in Kathmandu.\n\n5:30 p.m. (1145 GMT)\n\nAn Indian seismologist says more than 70 aftershocks have been recorded in the Himalayan region since Saturday's earthquake.\n\nJ.L.

Kumari, a Kathmandu resident, said she was desperate to check on her family in her village in eastern Nepal. \"I want to get at least a night of peace,\" she said.\n\nOver the past few days, the government has been running school buses free of charge for people wishing to travel to remote villages, worst-hit by Saturday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake.\n\nFive days after the quake, tents at the Tudikhel grounds, in the heart of Kathmandu, thinned out by Thursday morning. Overnight rainfall forced people to return to their homes, many of which were damaged in the quake.\n\nNepal's weather office predicted rain all day Thursday, with the weather was expected to improve later in the day or Friday.\n\nPolice in Nepal say the death toll from Saturday's earthquake has topped 5,500.\n\nThe Kathmandu police say 5,489 have died and another 11,440 people have been injured in Nepal.\n\nThe quake that was centered just outside Kathmandu also triggered an avalanche that killed at least 19 people at the Everest base camp.\n\nAnother 61 were killed in neighboring India and Bangladesh, and China's official Xinhua News Agency reported 25 dead in Tibet.", "Boeing Co.'s smallest version of the 737 jetliner faces an uncertain future as Southwest Airlines Co., the carrier that championed the plane, focuses on larger models.\n\nSouthwest is talking with Boeing about switching some or all of its remaining 56 orders for the 737-700 to a version that seats 32 more passengers, Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said in an interview. The Dallas-based carrier last took delivery of a new -700 in 2011.\n\nAirlines and planemakers are watching to see whether Southwest, Boeing's biggest narrow-body customer, will also amend its plans to receive the 737 Max 7, an update to the -700 that is due to enter service late this decade. The airline accounts for almost half of the Max 7 aircraft on order -- but has fewer of those than the larger Max 8 model.\n\n\"If Southwest converts to the Max 8, then it puts a significant dent into the business case for the Max 7,\" said Michel Merluzeau, vice president for global aerospace strategy and business development with consultant Frost & Sullivan.\n\nBoeing isn't backing off from its plans to offer the Max 7, whose orders account for about 2 percent of the backlog of 2,715 of the redesigned 737s. The most-popular variant is the Max 8, a new plane equivalent to the bigger 737-800s that Southwest has been emphasizing in recent years.\n\n\"It's clear to us there is a place for the Max 7,\" Boeing Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said Wednesday in an interview. \"It's something that's not going away.\"\n\nCompetitors Circle\n\nWithout more demand for the Max 7, Boeing risks seeing its narrow-body lineup shrink to essentially one model at a time when planemakers from Brazil, Canada and China are targeting the same market segment, according to Frost & Sullivan's Merluzeau.\n\nDemand for the 737 is now concentrated around variants including the -800 and Max 8 that share the same fuselage, with less interest in the relatively petite -700 and Max 7. Airbus Group NV, which has overtaken Boeing in single-aisle sales, has orders more evenly distributed between its two largest A320-family aircraft, Merluzeau said.\n\nSouthwest's support for the 737-700 has been critical. It provided input during the jet's development, was the first operator and relies on the plane for two-thirds of its fleet. The airline is due to be the initial user of the new Max 7.\n\nThe carrier also has made clear that its future lies with roomier planes. Southwest is buying 170 Max 8 models and has rights to convert some of its 30 Max 7's on order into the larger version. The Max 8 will be similar to the 737-800, which Southwest flies with 175 seats, 22 percent more than its -700s.\n\nNo Hurry\n\n\"We really don't have a decision on whether we want 8s or 7s because the 7 is not available until 2019,\" Van de Ven said Tuesday.\n\nSouthwest has been taking the larger 737-800s to handle traffic growth at its Dallas home base, where gates are limited, and the expansion of its network beyond the contiguous U.S. to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n\"It's a very economical airplane for us,\" Van de Ven said. \"It's larger. There's a nice revenue increase on the airplane and it's minimal in terms of additional costs. If we think we have market opportunities that will fill up that demand, that's when we would pick an -800.\"\n\nBoeing's order book reflects the industry's tilt toward larger narrow-body aircraft.\n\nSince the start of 2011, Boeing has orders for just 36 737-700s, compared with 1,408 sales for larger versions of the current 737. If Southwest decided to shift all its orders to the -800, the smaller plane's backlog would dwindle to just 32 jets.\n\n\"Southwest was the bell-cow customer for the -700,\" said George Hamlin, who runs Hamlin Transportation Consulting. \"They've moved on.\"", "BERLIN, April 30 (Reuters) - Airbus Group is planning to make a complaint to the authorities in Germany following reports that German foreign intelligence agency BND was helping U.S. agencies spy on European firms, it said on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday Germany's interior minister Thomas de Maziere, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, denied that he lied to parliament about German intelligence cooperation with U.S. spy agencies.\n\nDe Maiziere has come under attack from the government's opposition parties over his record as chief of staff in 2005-09, asking whether he knew the BND had helped U.S. agencies spy on European firms such Airbus.\n\n\"We've asked the government for more information,\" an Airbus spokesman in Germany said on Thursday. \"We will launch a complaint against an unknown person on suspicion of industrial espionage,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, when asked about the reports on a call with reporters following first-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said he wasn't surprised that Airbus, as a major aerospace and defence company, could be the target of spying efforts.\n\nThe complaint was first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.

Those figures were broadly in line with the trio's spending in previous filings recorded in January by researchers at anti-corruption group Transparency International -- the Commission itself does not provide comparative data with previous years.However, some of the other big spenders recorded sharp increases, including Google and Germany's Deutsche Bank, which doubled their expenditure, U.S. chemicals group Dow, which recorded four times the level of spending as its previous entry.None of the companies listed offered comment.Google, subject of a high-profile antitrust case launched by the Commission two weeks ago after a five-year investigation, spent 3.0-3.5 million euros ($3.4-3.9 million), the same as Dow . Microsoft, which has itself been fined heavily in the past by EU antitrust authorities, has been prominent among those pursuing complaints against its American rival Google.Two German companies were among those which spent 3 million euros or more last year. Deutsche Bank was the fourth biggest spender, reporting lobbying activity worth 3.96 million euros, and engineer Siemens spent 3.23 million.China's tech leader Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] reported spending of 3.0 million euros in 2014. That was the same as it had previously reported as spending in its 2012 fiscal year.DATA QUALITY IMPROVINGAlso reporting spending of 3.0 million was paij GmbH, a German company that sells a mobile payments app and which put itself on the Register for the first time in March. Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment.U.S. engineering firm General Electric reported lobby spending in the EU of 3.25-3.50 million euros for 2013. No 2014 data appeared on its page on the Transparency Register.Transparency International's Daniel Freund said some changes in data filed appeared to reflect a recognition among companies that the Register now set more rigorous reporting requirements. Over 1,000 organisations registered for the first time after Jan. 27, when it became a condition for access to officials.\"The data quality seems to be getting better,\" Freund said, while noting that the Register only went some way to clarifying how much effort was going in to lobbying in Brussels and saying that the Commission appeared to have so far put only limited staff resources into scrutiny of the accuracy of entries.Other organisations, including non-governmental pressure groups, must also declare spending. Environmental lobby Greenpeace, for example, declared 1.0-1.25 million euros in 2013.A second element of transparency introduced under European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker since he took office in November is a register of contacts by commissioners and senior staff with companies, lobby groups and their representatives.Transparency International research found U.S. firms Google, Microsoft and General Electric, as well as European planemaker Airbus, were among the most active in visiting top EU officials since such meetings first had to made public in December. (Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; @macdonaldrtr; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "WASHINGTON (AP) -- International aviation officials are trying to quickly come up with safer packaging for cargo shipments of lithium-ion batteries on passenger planes after U.S. testing confirmed that aircraft fire suppression systems can't prevent overheated batteries from causing powerful explosions and fires.\n\nThe hazardous cargo committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency, met this week in Montreal. Officials familiar with the discussions said the panel heard a detailed presentation by aircraft manufacturers and pilot unions on the potential for the batteries to cause an explosion and resulting fire capable of destroying a plane.\n\nThe committee agreed to create a special working group to try to come up with packaging for batteries that would contain any fire or explosive gases to the inside of the package, officials said. If the working group cannot come up with such packaging, officials said they consider it likely that a formal proposal to ban bulk battery shipments from passenger planes will be offered at an ICAO meeting on dangerous cargo in October.\n\nThe batteries are used in devices from cellphones to electric cars. It's not unusual for as many as 80,000 batteries to be carried on board a plane. The global battery industry has been lobbying heavily against significant restrictions on battery shipments other than minor changes to current regulations.\n\nTesting by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration over the past year and a half has repeatedly shown that a single short-circuiting battery in a large shipment of batteries can cause overheating to spread to other batteries. Fire suppression systems have been able to put out the initial flames, but they haven't been able to stop the spread of continually increasing temperatures known as thermal runaway.\n\nThe overheated batteries emit a mixture of explosive gases, of which hydrogen is the most abundant. As the gases build up, they eventually explode and ignite an intense fire.\n\nAn FAA test in February resulted in a powerful explosion despite being conducted in a pressurized chamber with an atmosphere of 5 percent halon. Halon is the main gas used to suppress fires in the cargo compartments of passenger planes. Triggered by a rise in temperature, fire suppression systems unleash halon until the gas reaches 5 percent of the air in the cargo compartment. It has long been accepted by aviation authorities that this level of halon is enough to put out most fires, including a lithium-ion battery fire.\n\n\"We now no longer believe that would be the case,\" said pilot Mark Rogers, who represents the Air Line Pilots Association in the U.S. and Canada and other international pilot unions on cargo issues in the civil aviation organization's proceedings.\n\nThe February test resulted in an explosion in which pressure in the chamber rose from a normal 15 pounds per square inch to 70 psi, according to an agency slide presentation. Without the presence of halon, the explosion was even more powerful, with pressure rising to about 80 psi.\n\nTwo safety experts interviewed by The Associated Press described an explosion of that force as \"significant.\" John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, said such an explosion could possibly blow a hole in a plane and cause depressurization for passengers without destroying the plane. He pointed to examples of planes that have landed safely after experiencing such a blowout.\n\nLast month, the International Coordination Council of Aerospace Industry Associations, which represents aircraft companies such as Boeing and Airbus, and the pilot unions submitted a joint working paper to the civil aviation organization recommending a ban on bulk battery shipments on passenger planes until safer packaging can be developed. The paper, which is not considered a formal proposal under the U.N. agency's rules, called the threat of battery fires \"an unacceptable risk.\"", "BERLIN -- European aviation company Airbus said Friday it is taking legal action following reports that it was targeted by German and U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThe company, which makes civilian and military aircraft and is a fierce rival of U.S. manufacturer Boeing, said it will file a criminal complaint with prosecutors in Germany against \"persons unknown.\" That's a common procedure in Germany which requires authorities to investigate.\n\n\"We are aware that as a major player in this industry we are a target for intelligence activities,\" the company said in a statement. \"In this particular case there appears to be a reasonable suspicion of alleged industrial espionage.

But that included 16 cents of special \"non-cash\" accounting charges. Without those charges, adjusted earnings were 96 cents per share, up 17 percent.\n\nTotal sales fell 2 percent or $16 million from a year ago, to $637 million, while the cost of sales was also up 2 percent to $463.7 million.\n\nBut the effects of foreign exchange transactions for converting euros, Japanese yen and British pounds to dollars added up to $28 million. Otherwise, sales were up by 2 percent.\n\n\"There were a lot of moving parts to this quarter,\" Chairman and CEO John Scannell said in an interview. \"You have to dig down a layer below to get a sense of the business. The quarter was actually up nicely versus a year ago.\"\n\nThe non-cash charges included $8 million or 13 cents per share for correcting an accounting mistake in Moog's Space and Defense business that had accumulated over several years but was only discovered this quarter. The error, which was small in any one quarter but added up significantly over time, related to how certain balance-sheet accounts for one of its facilities were improperly recorded, Scannell explained.\n\nAlso during the quarter, Moog sold two small facilities that formerly belonged to Buffalo-based Ethox Corp., located in the Rochester suburb of Rush and in Erie, Pa. The Rush facility, with 40 employees, provides laboratory and testing services, while the Erie facility makes sterilization services, with 10 employees. Both serve the medical device and drug industries, and were part of Moog's struggling Medical Devices business.\n\nThey were acquired for $3 million by investment firm Tartan Holdings LLC, which combined them to form a new company called Iuvo Bioscience. However, Moog had to record a $1 million accounting write-down on the facilities' value, equal to 3 cents per share.\n\n\"Excluding these charges, our underlying business performed well in the face of an adverse shift in our aircraft sales, and on-going macroeconomic headwinds,\" Scannell said in the earnings release. \"As we navigate through these challenges, we continue to focus on operational improvements, strong cash flow and allocating capital to create value for our shareholders.\"\n\nMoog has been trying to sell its medical devices business for two years, since concluding that the business it had expanded into with its purchase of Ethox was no longer a core area because of new government regulations and other factors that caused losses. The company thought it had a deal to sell the entire division, but that fell through after the buyer backed out.\n\nSo officials decided to sell it in pieces, after realizing that its different product lines were valued in different ways, Scannell explained. The company has been working to simplify and clean up that portfolio for the last 24 months, selling the Ethox facility in downtown Buffalo and more recently the two in Rush and Erie.\n\nScannell said Moog will likely try again later this year to see what the remaining business would fetch. It's now performing far better, with revenues rising 16 percent in the first quarter to $32 million, especially for pumps and administration sets, so it might be worth more to a buyer, he said. But he would not commit to a sale.\n\n\"We'll have to see what the market values it at and then we'll decide what we'll do with it,\" he said. \"Two years ago, it was losing money, and we couldn't see our way through it. Now it's performing quite nicely, so some of that urgency has completely changed and it's a different way of looking at the business now.\"\n\nIn other areas, total aircraft sales were flat at $274 million, as commercial aircraft sales rose 5 percent to $140 million, while military aircraft sales fell 5 percent or $7 million to $134 million.\n\nOriginal equipment commercial sales rose 12 percent to $111 million, including $64 million to Boeing Co. and $22 million for the European maker of Airbus planes, but aftermarket sales fell 16 percent to $29 million because Boeing spent heavily a year ago on initial purchases of spares for its 787 aircraft program.\n\nMilitary original equipment sales fell 2.4 percent or $2 million to $80 million, as lower revenues from the F-18 and KC-46 tanker programs offset higher sales from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. Aftermarket sales fell 8 percent to $54 million.\n\nIn Space and Defense, sales fell 2 percent to $93 million. Defense sales rose 2 percent, as strong missile and naval controls revenues overcame weaker security sales, but space sales fell 6 percent.\n\nIndustrial revenues fell 15 percent, mostly because of foreign-currency, but also from weaker global industrial markets. Energy controls sales fell 16 percent, while simulation and test products revenues fell 12 percent.\n\nAnd the components business recorded a 7 percent gain in sales to $109 million, including an 11 percent increase in aerospace and defense products to $46 million, a 9 percent gain in industrial products and a 6 percent increase in energy sales. Medical sales were flat.\n\nResearch and development expenses fell 15.6 percent to $31.4 million, while selling, general and administrative costs dropped 12.1 percent to $92.2 million.\n\nAt quarter's end, Moog said it had a 12-month backlog of $1.3 billion.

Microsoft, which has itself been fined heavily in the past by EU antitrust authorities, has been prominent among those pursuing complaints against its American rival Google.\n\nTwo German companies were among those which spent 3 million euros or more last year. Deutsche Bank was the fourth biggest spender, reporting lobbying activity worth 3.96 million euros, and engineer Siemens spent 3.23 million.\n\nChina's tech leader Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] reported spending of 3.0 million euros in 2014.

Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nU.S. engineering firm General Electric reported lobby spending in the EU of 3.25-3.50 million euros for 2013. No 2014 data appeared on its page on the Transparency Register.\n\nTransparency International's Daniel Freund said some changes in data filed appeared to reflect a recognition among companies that the Register now set more rigorous reporting requirements. Over 1,000 organizations registered for the first time after Jan. 27, when it became a condition for access to officials.\n\n\"The data quality seems to be getting better,\" Freund said, while noting that the Register only went some way to clarifying how much effort was going in to lobbying in Brussels and saying that the Commission appeared to have so far put only limited staff resources into scrutiny of the accuracy of entries.\n\nOther organizations, including non-governmental pressure groups, must also declare spending. Environmental lobby Greenpeace, for example, declared 1.0-1.25 million euros in 2013.\n\nA second element of transparency introduced under European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker since he took office in November is a register of contacts by commissioners and senior staff with companies, lobby groups and their representatives.\n\nTransparency International research found U.S. firms Google, Microsoft and General Electric, as well as European planemaker Airbus, were among the most active in visiting top EU officials since such meetings first had to made public in December.\n\n(Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; @macdonaldrtr; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "Malaysia has struggled financially in the wake of twin tragedies in 2014 Photos Airbus\n\nIt seems big is no longer best for disaster-hit Malaysia Airlines -- it's said to be offloading its entire fleet of A380 superjumbos.\n\nMalaysia has struggled financially in the wake of twin tragedies in 2014, including the disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of MH17 over Ukraine.\n\nAviation website Leeham News, citing the airline, says Malaysia is offering all six of its A380s for sale or lease.\n\nRestructuring measures also include letting go of its two Boeing 747-400Fs and four Boeing 777-200ERs.\n\nMalaysia Airlines, which has a fleet of about 150 jets, was privatized last year following the two disasters.

Give to Arsenal four top-class players and I think they will again be the Invincibles. Man United have a phenomenal squad. They will invest hugely again in the summer. City have done phenomenally, winning two titles in three years, and people say they will invest hugely. Liverpool fighting for the title for many years. Next year it will be even more difficult for everyone.\n\n\"At this moment, it's very difficult in the Premier League for a team to be dominant. This is not Germany with Bayern Munich. This is not Switzerland with Basel. This is not Scotland with Celtic.\"\n\nChelsea would need only one win from their remaining four matches if they beat Leicester City overnight to be mathematically certain of winning the Premier League, with Mourinho facing a choice between continuing with Didier Drogba as his main striker and recalling Diego Costa following his hamstring injury.\n\nDrogba's future is uncertain, with the 37-year-old determined to play for at least another season but having received no contract offer from Chelsea. Mourinho has distanced himself from the situation and suggested that it would be for Drogba and Roman Abramovich, the club owner, to decide the player's future.\n\nAsked if Drogba could keep playing in the Premier League, Mourinho said: \"I think it belongs to him: What he feels, what he thinks. When they reach this age, I think it's more about them to analyse themselves. It's not just about the body. It's about the body, the brain, the heart, family, projects for the future.\"\n\nChelsea lost Frank Lampard last season and it appears that Petr Cech is also almost certain to leave this summer. It would leave only captain John Terry as the only original \"untouchable\" from Mourinho's first great team at Chelsea. But Mourinho dismissed any suggestion of a leadership void. \"Chelsea leadership is my leadership,\" he said. \"For good and for bad. It's not the players' leadership.\" Even on the pitch? \"Yes.\"\n\nMourinho then made a particular point of praising newer players who are gathering experience. \"(Branislav) Ivanovic is experienced. (Cesar) Azpilicueta gets experience. (Eden) Hazard is here for three years. (Nemanja) Matic gets experience. The years are for everyone, not just for them. Chelsea lost, in the end of last year, what I consider for sure, one of the five most important players in the history of Chelsea FC: Frank Lampard. But life goes on. You have to think about the future and to build, and you have to go. Because, with Frank Lampard, Chelsea lost a match winner with the number of goals he scored, a big character, a player without injuries who played every game, a player who beat every record in the Premier League. An absolutely amazing player.\"\n\nMourinho also said he expected Leicester to stay up following their run of four successive wins (before last night). \"I was surprised with their bad position. I will be not surprised when they stay in the division.\" THE DAILY TELEGRAPH", "Each week at ProSoccerTalk we will hear from from U.S. national team and Stoke City defender Geoff Cameron, who is now a special correspondent for NBCSports.com.\n\n[ RELATED: Cameron's latest on PST ]\n\nThe proud Bostonian tells us what life is like behind-the-scenes in England's top-flight with Q&A's, first-person pieces and more. This week Geoff recaps his day in the studio with the NBCSN crew for Arsenal vs. Chelsea, Stoke's progress, Chelsea's defense and the relegation battle.\n\nTake it away, Geoff...\n\nLooking back at last weeks game against Sunderland on Saturday, we were disappointed to not win but after a bad start we recovered well to get a point. I came off in the 85th minute with a bit of a fascial strain near my hamstring, so I was disappointed to go down with an injury but I am focused on trying to do everything possible to make sure I am fit and ready to go for this weekends big game against Swansea City.\n\nOn Sunday it was a privilege to be an analyst in the NBC studio at Arsenal vs. Chelsea and work alongside Gary Lineker, Graeme Le Saux, Lee Dixon and Arlo White. It was very cool to be a part of that with the entire production crew behind-the-scenes and to get that experience in the studio. Watching two of the best teams in the Premier League, it was a game where Jose Mourinho really showed his brilliance.\n\n[ RELATED: Watch full match replays ]\n\nTactically, everybody questioned him before the match because he wasn't playing with a striker but Chelsea defended so well with John Terry being the leader back there. The way he organized the defense was sensational. Mourinho, tactically, made it very, very difficult for Arsenal to break them down and that is why they walked away with a point and they are a point closer to clinching the title. That's the way he will look at it.\n\nFor Chelsea, the key to defending as good as they do is the partnerships and familiarity they have back there. Speaking from experience, the more you play with the player next to you then the better you get. You get more comfortable in the partnerships and you learn their habits and vice versa. That breeds faith in each other. That is one thing that Mourinho has done really well with all of his teams when you look throughout history. He has always had that team camaraderie and cohesiveness. That really resonates on the field and you see that players love to play from him and after chatting with other guys who have played under him before, they all say he's \"a players coach\" and guys want to play for him and doing anything to win. That is the main thing, that winning mentality. And the fact that he is always there to back up his players means a lot. That relates to the field because you see his guys throwing their body on the line and blocking balls, plus after the game you see how excited they were to get that point.\n\n[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]\n\nA lot of people aren't fans of the way Chelsea are playing lately but they got a result and its very difficult to defend the way they defend, especially when they were playing a team like Arsenal who are very good on the counter and in possession of the ball. When they keep the defensive and midfield lines very tight, it just shows how well organized and disciplined they are. That is not easy to do, believe me.\n\nBut this way of playing is nothing new to Mourinho either. I remember watching them play in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semifinal against Barcelona back in 2010. Mourinho set Inter up to defend away at the Nou Camp and they lost 1-0 but limited Barca and made it to the Champions League final, which they ended up winning thanks to another superb defensive display against Bayern Munich. His teams are okay with not having the ball in certain games and I think Mourinho knows Chelsea haven't played their best football since January but they are finding ways to win. That is what good teams do. At Stoke, that is what we are trying to do. We have done a good job at that but it is very hard to be consistent throughout the season. Being able to not play well when lots of players are struggling but grind out results and play well defensively, to make sure everything goes your way, that is very hard to do.\n\n[ RELATED: Premier League schedule ]\n\nMoving on to Stoke, if you look at the form everyone is in above us they are doing well. The likes of Southampton, Tottenham and Swansea are ahead of us right now. Then you have all the big boys ahead of them. We have beat some big teams and we want to stay in the top 10 and we will be very disappointed if we don't finish in the top 10. Our goal is to finish higher than we did last year and if we finish ninth then that is one step closer to getting to the next goal. We play Swansea this weekend and if we beat them, we move up to eighth and we just want to finish the season strong and keep improving. Every year you have to get better and better, finish in a higher place, get more points and more wins. Everything.\n\nLooking down below us right now... man, it is a madhouse down there! The relegation battle is going to be huge and one of the big storylines in the league between now and the end of the season. Anything can happen. You cannot predict anything. Who would have thought Liverpool would have lost to Hull on Tuesday? It all depends on who shows up that day. That is the great thing about football and sports in general. On any given day anybody can beat anybody. Look at Leicester City, I know Robert Huth very well and as soon as he turned up at Leicester on loan from Stoke he told me \"I think we are going to stay up\" and he has believed it and the players there obviously have faith in each other. They are one of those teams where everyone is playing for one another.\n\nAt Stoke we were in a bit of a sticky situation a few years back, not quite as late in the season as this, but it was anxious around the locker room and the entire club. Everybody is on edge and it is a tough situation to deal with. When you see teams like Leicester, the big reason for their resurgence is that they have faith and they have shown their resilience over the last four weekends. With things so close at the bottom, it makes the games more entertaining and it will make the end of the season very interesting. For teams at the bottom, there has to be no fear right now. The fact that everybody doubts them already, that means they have to go out with the mentality of saying 'hey, let's play every game like its our last.'\n\n[ RELATED: Latest Premier League standings ]\n\nTo finish off with, I just want to give a big shout out to everybody in the production staff at NBC. The likes of Pierre Moosa have been wonderful in helping me along with my broadcast work and it was great to be involved in the studio show last Sunday and I'm looking forward to hopefully getting involved in a few more coming up to get some more experience. It was a long day but was really fun, entertaining and I felt comfortable.

Leonardo Ulloa had impressed for Castellon in the Spanish Second Division.\n\nTheir current Leicester team-mate Esteban Cambiasso won Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League with Inter Milan under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThe Foxes' revival from being three points adrift at the foot of the table at the turn of the year to four straight wins taking them out of the bottom three has been the ultimate team effort.\n\nPearson's fiery brand of management has turned impressive performances throughout the season into results, the likes of Vardy and Ulloa are back in the goals and a defence including Wes Morgan and Robert Huth has upped the organisation with two clean sheets on the bounce.\n\nCambiasso has been the absolute hub. Just as he did for Inter's greatest season ever, his tough tackling, incisive passing and the odd goal has turned him into the side's leader.\n\nThe Argentine has given Leicester the added sheen of class and experience to turn plucky battlers into a Premier League force.\n\nThere's still work to do, of course, but after Wednesday's clash against Chelsea and Mourinho Leicester see out their survival charge with winnable games against Newcastle, Southampton, Sunderland and QPR. Only a collapse would see the Foxes return to the Championship.\n\nCambiasso will be up for the biggest praise - Pearson admitted he has called upon his tactical experience for this latest test against the champions elect and the Argentine's former mentor.\n\nMourinho, too, spoke warmly about his former midfielder this week. 'He was fundamental in my golden team,' the Chelsea boss said.\n\n'He's one of the players who means a lot to me and he's been phenomenal for Leicester. I am very happy for him. Next season, for sure, he will play for Leicester in the Premier League again.'\n\nIt's testament to Cambiasso's drive - so evident in his play - that he chose Leicester when his glorious decade at the San Siro drew to a close last summer. Not for him the MLS or Qatar, he knew he had more to offer to a team short on established Premier League quality.\n\nThat ambition has always been there. He moved to Spain from his native Argentina at the age of 16 to be part of Real Madrid's youth set-up in 1996. He struggled to make an impact - and returned home two years later to play for Independiente.\n\nUnperturbed by his failure to make an impression first time around, and via a spell at River Plate, Cambiasso returned for another bite at the Real Madrid cherry in 2002. His time at the Bernabeu saw a La Liga title but he became victim to the Galacticos policy and was moved on to Inter Milan in 2004.\n\nHere, Cambiasso settled. He immediately became a key midfielder for the Nerazzurri alongside the likes of Juan Sebastian Veron. He won five Serie A titles at a huge club who had to that point been without one since 1989.\n\nHis international career - he ended up with 52 caps for Argentina - was in full flow at this point, and Cambiasso scored one of the most memorable World Cup goals of all time at Germany 2006, finishing off an astonishing 24-pass move against Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nMourinho's arrival at Inter in 2008 was the catalyst for Cambiasso's peak. Hard-working, all-action and technically brilliant - the Argentine is an archetype 'Mourinho player.'\n\nThe Portuguese made him the apex of his triumvirate midfield alongside stalwart Javier Zanetti, allowing the attacking talents of Wesley Sneijder to flourish. Winning the Scudetto at a canter, the culmination of Mourinho's Inter was winning the Champions League in 2010.\n\nThe campaign isn't remembered fondly by lovers of tiki-taka. Mourinho allowed the opposition the ball in beating free-flowing Barcelona in the semi-finals and Bayern Munich in the final, but it was a modern tactical masterpiece, with Cambiasso vital to the system.\n\nIt came as no surprise that the man Argentines call 'egg in a bun' wasn't short of suitors when Inter chose not to renew his deal four years later.\n\nPearson convincing him he would become the engine of a side new to the world's most watched league clearly appealed, and he's grabbed the chance with admirable determination.\n\nReunions will be the last thing on either Cambiasso or Mourinho's mind on Wednesday night. Chelsea need a win to set up a title-winning party on Sunday, while Cambiasso will resume his role as the key man hauling the Foxes to safety.", "Brendan Rodgers turned the attention on his players after a meek 1-0 defeat at Hull worsened a miserable end to Liverpool's season and ended vague aspirations of achieving a Champion's League spot.\n\nA fourth loss in seven games, including the FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa, and their campaign is ending with barely a whimper, Rodgers achieving the unwanted distinction of being the only Liverpool manager for 50 years to still be without a trophy after three seasons.\n\nMeanwhile the 42-year-old, who has spent close to \u00a3230million during his time in charge at Anfield, is already talking about dipping into the club's transfer fund again.\n\n'I need to build a team that can get through the rough waters as well,' he said. 'We need a team that can get through the smooth and the rough.'\n\nIt echoed his defence after a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion a few days previously. I need a new striker, he intimated after that performance.\n\nMuch of the focus for Liverpool's slump has been on the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. He and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 goals between them last campaign but Sturridge has spent much of the season sidelined through injury.\n\nThe players recruited with the Suarez transfer funds - Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - have failed to perform, scoring just five goals between them. Lazar Markovic, the 21-year-old Serbian winger bought from Benfica for \u00a320m, has also made limited impact.\n\nBut how much of this is bad luck and should Rodgers shoulder more of the blame? Perhaps for not better employing the \u00a3100m made available to him in the summer and more recently for being so tactically rigid, sticking to his maverick 3-4-3 formation even when it seems other managers have worked him out.\n\n'Three months ago I was a tactical genius, performing to a good level,' Rodgers said. 'We lost a couple of games, some important games, and now you're not so good. But that is football, that's what will happen, people will speculate.'\n\nLiverpool hero Steve Nicol, who made 340 appearances for the Reds between 1981 and 1994, took umbrage to Rodgers' suggestion he was a 'tactical genius,' and suggested the board should lure outgoing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp to Anfield in his place.\n\n'I'd love to know who was calling him a \"tactical genius,\"' said Nicol. 'When was he a tactical genius?'\n\nIt seems unlikely Liverpool are going to sack Rodgers any time soon but it was telling that Klopp was immediately linked with his job when it was announced he would be leaving Dortmund in the summer.\n\nIn response, Rodgers said: 'There will always be names mentioned at a club like Liverpool. That is the mark of a huge, worldwide club. That will continue for however long I'm here.\n\n'I don't think there's anyone better [than me] for realising Fenway Sports Groups's goals, I didn't take over a 10-year machine that was used to winning. I am super-ambitious in terms of wanting to win and there will be no greater place to do that than here, but of course in modern football there are lots of processes that go on behind the scenes that people will never be aware of.'\n\nCharismatic 47-year-old Klopp has overseen a stunning turnaround in Dortmund's fortunes since 2008, winning back-to-back Bundesliga titles in his first two seasons and consistently defying a much smaller budget to challenge Bayern Munich for dominance in Germany.\n\nOn Tuesday night Klopp's men ended Pep Guardiola and Bayern's dream of doing the treble by beating them in a penalty shootout in the semi-final of the German Cup.\n\nWith this week marking 25 years since Liverpool were last crowned Champions, their fans would be forgiven for looking longingly at Klopp and wondering if the eccentric manager could weave some of the same magic in Merseyside that he has in Dortmund.\n\nIn defence of Rodgers, he has not lost his ability to manage young players overnight and not so long ago he was being praised for eking the best out of Raheem Sterling. He has also tied down the excellent Jordan Henderson to a five-year contract - the midfielder praising his manager after signing.", "Bundesliga champions travel to Barcelona for Champions League semi-final first leg on May 6\n\nPep Guardiola appeared in a better spirits as he returned to the training ground on the day after his Bayern Munich side crashed out of the German Cup.\n\nThe Spaniard cut a discontented figure as Jurgen Klopp raced past him to celebrate Borussia Dortmund's dramatic penalty shoot-out victory in the cup semi-finals on Tuesday.\n\nDespite not a single player finding the net in the shoot-out, Guardiola refused to blame his players, saying: 'I'm proud of my team as never before. You can't criticise your team when they've played so well.\n\n'It's the best we've played against Dortmund my time here in Germany. We looked a bit tired in the shootout. Congratulations to Dortmund and best of luck to them for the final.'\n\n'There is nothing positive in a defeat,' club CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told reporters.

Photo: Internet BERLIN, Apr 29: Bayern Munich's hopes of a treble are over after they crashed out of the German Cup at the hands of Borussia Dortmund, report agencies. Pep Guardiola's side missed all four of their penalties during a shootout following the match which finished 1-1 after 120 minutes of play. Xabi Alonso and Philipp Lahm took Bayern's first two penalties but, remarkably, both slipped and fluffed their lines at the crucial moment. Mario Gotze and Manuel Neuer also failed to find the back of the net while Die Borussen bagged two of their three spot kicks to progress. Robert Lewandowski had earlier given the Bundesliga champions the lead in the first-half with a finish from a tight angle after his chipped effort rebounded off the post. But, after 70 minutes of sustained Bayern dominance, Dortmund burst into life and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled proceedings 15 minutes from time. Neuer thought he had denied the striker but replays proved Aubameyang's six-yard effort had crossed the line before it was palmed away. There were to be no more goals in normal time and Dortmund were reduced to 10 men in extra-time when substitute Kevin Kampl was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Bastian Schweinsteiger. Jurgen Klopp's side held on though, and penalty conversions from Ilkay Gundogan and Sebastien Kehl were enough to seal progression for Die Borussen. Dortmund chief Klopp, who earlier this month announced he will leave the club at the end of the season, was delighted with the performance of his players. \"That was a hell of a game,\" said Klopp. \"Both teams gave everything and Bayern were certainly superior in the first half, but we more than deserved to equalise in the second. Today was our day.\" Bayern boss Guardiola refused to dwell on his side's missed chances, instead opting to praise the determination of the opposition. \"I am very proud of my team,\" said Guardiola. \"We played very well. I congratulate Dortmund.\"", "BARCELONA, Apr 29: Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez both scored twice as Barcelona thrashed Getafe 6-0 on Tuesday to stay on course to reclaim the Spanish league title, reports AP. Barcelona's ninth win in 10 rounds provisionally lifted it five points clear of Real Madrid before the second-place side hosts Almeria on Wednesday. There will then be four rounds left. Messi converted a ninth-minute penalty earned by Suarez to get Barcelona rolling at Camp Nou before setting up the Uruguay striker's first goal. Neymar was next to get onto the score sheet before Xavi Hernandez and Suarez both struck before halftime. Messi scored again just after the restart for his 49th goal in 49 games in all competitions this season. \"When this team is playing at this level, it makes it difficult for any rival,\" Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said. Also, David Moyes' Real Sociedad fought back with 10 men for a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao in a Basque Country derby, while last-place Cordoba moved one step closer to relegation after losing 1-0 at Levante. Messi closed the gap with Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo with his 38th league goal. Ronaldo leads the domestic competition with 39 goals. Suarez also continued his strong finish to his first campaign with the Catalan club by scoring his 13th and 14th goals in his last 15 appearances, while Neymar netted his fourth goal in his three-game scoring run. Barcelona's attacking trio broke the 100-goal mark for the season, with Neymar adding 32 and Suarez 21 to Messi's haul for a combined 102 goals. Their goals have put Barcelona in contention for three titles this season. Positioned to dethrone Atletico Madrid in the league, Barcelona has reached a Champions League semifinal against Bayern Munich and the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao. \"I don't know if there is a key (to our success), there is the complete commitment of the team, our fans, everyone,\" Suarez said. \"We are obliged to achieve important things and we are facing the critical stretch of the season.\" Luis Enrique rotated his starting 11 with the pacesetters playing their second of three Liga games in an eight-day span as the season reaches its conclusion. But with Barcelona's star-studded strike trio intact, Getafe never had a chance as the goals came in bunches to quickly put the result beyond doubt. Messi chipped in his spot kick \"Panenka\" style to start the rout when Suarez was tripped by Alvaro Arroyo just inside the area. After Barcelona goalie Claudio Bravo backtracked to swat away Fredy Hinestroza's lob, Suarez used an acrobatic effort to sweep in Messi's lobbed pass in the 25th. Barcelona's pressure led to Mehdi Lacen losing the ball three minutes later, and Suarez laid it off for Neymar to cut back and slot in Barcelona's third. Xavi curled in a long strike on the half-hour mark before he set up Suarez with a deft back-heeled touch, with Suarez using one touch to curve home his shot in the 40th. Messi added his second two minutes after halftime with a strike similar to Suarez's, except he beat goalie Vicente Guaita from the right side of the area as he lifted the ball into the far side of the net. Hinestroza was denied a consolation goal by the woodwork in the 71st. The loss left Getafe in 13th place, right behind Sociedad. Bilbao went a goal up and benefited from an extra man after Sociedad defender Mikel Gonzalez was shown a straight red card for fouling Aritz Aduriz, giving the striker the chance to convert a penalty in the 52nd. But left back Alberto de la Bella looped in a difficult shot eight minutes later to equalize for the visitors at San Mames Stadium. Levante moved six points from danger after Victor Casadesus set up striker David Barral for the 41st- minute winner, keeping Cordoba winless in 16 rounds.", "I can picture Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola hunched over in his kitchen, still dressed in one of his typically immaculate suits, a couple buttons undone and his tie hastily loosened, remarking aloud about his team's debilitating injury crisis this season. \"Just when I thought we were out, they pull us back in.\"\n\nComing into yesterday's DFB Pokal semifinal against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were in great position to repeat their historic treble-winning season of a couple years ago. They had just days before mathematically ensured their fourth-consecutive Bundesliga title, were big favorites in the domestic cup, and were rounding into form and shape to challenge for the Champions League. After injuries hampered their performance in the first leg of the UCL quarterfinals against Porto, they blew them out in stunning fashion in the return leg and eagerly awaited the imminent returns of such critical cogs as Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Rib\u00e9ry, and hopefully a little further down the line, David Alaba and Javi Mart\u00ednez.\n\nInstead of cruising to victory during yesterday's game against Borussia Dortmund and carving out a few minutes for Robben and Schweinsteiger to stretch their legs, Bayern lost the opportunity to win the DFB Pokal, and saw Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben fall to significant injuries. That brutal two-handed bash to the side of Lewandowski's head towards the end of that match really did give him a concussion (because, duh), and it also broke his nose and jaw. And Robben's brief substitute appearance was made even shorter when he pulled up with what was discovered to be a season-ending torn calf muscle.\n\nAt this point it's unclear how much time Lewandowski will miss, but the odds of him suiting up for a semifinal match against Barcelona a week from today look long. Schweinsteiger managed to come through his sub appearance yesterday without injury, which will be a boost to Bayern's depleted midfield, but they'll still be hobbling into what are now essentially their season's final two games of any significance.\n\nEarlier this month, Medhi Benatia was injured for the 52nd time this season (though he might be ready for at least the second of the two semifinal matches), Holger Badstuber was just recently lost for the season, no one knows when Rib\u00e9ry will be back, and who knows how Mart\u00ednez will look after being sidelined for so long. Almost all of Bayern's key players have spent some time on the training table, and while it looked like everyone would come back at just the right time, here comes all of this.\n\nFor as often as dumb NFL fans impugn the physical nature of soccer, the two sports actually have more in common on the injury front that they realize. In both games, making it through the gauntlet that is the grueling schedule without too many key injury casualties is often even more important than your roster's raw talent when it comes to determining who winds up celebrating at the end of the season.", "With Newcastle United spluttering from one disaster to the next chief sports writer Lee Ryder knows how they can win back some of their fans\n\nIf Newcastle United wanted to end apathy and unrest in a heartbeat they should make an audacious move for Jurgen Klopp.\n\nAfter eight years of Mike Ashley, the majority of it spent in the doldrums, the Toon tycoon will never have a better chance to show he really does mean business.\n\nFor many fans, talk of Klopp is a pipe dream.\n\nAnd that's understandable - after all, the ambition seems to end at being a Premier League club and picking up the TV money, right?\n\nOr that's at least what fans have learned in the last few seasons.\n\nThe 16th, 10th and bottom-half finish we are about to witness this term tells us that.\n\nAshley wasn't present on Saturday against Swansea when another chorus of: \"We're **** and we're sick of it\".\n\nThat would end at even the mere talk of Newcastle showing some genuine ambition and going to get Klopp.\n\nThe German manager ticks all of the boxes at St James' Park.\n\nRead more: With Jurgen Klopp still without a club, Mike Ashley can end Newcastle United frustration\n\nHe has the tactical awareness to push the club back up the Premier League table, he knows how to shake a club up from Academy level to first team - but perhaps most importantly, he has the charisma to handle the job.\n\nIt's actually 19 years this week since Kevin Keegan's famous rant on Sky when he said: \"I would love it if we beat them\" in reference to Manchester United.\n\nWell that seems like a lifetime ago because the passion has been slowly drained away for the fans.\n\nJust like Keegan did at Newcastle, Klopp knows how to talk to the fans at Borussia Dortmund.\n\nKeegan once said at St James' Park: \"You have to give these fans what they want.\"\n\nThe mind could only boggle on sports desks up and down the country when you think of some of quotes Klopp would be capable of serving up.\n\nWhen asked ahead of a recent Champions League clash with Arsenal, Klopp commented that he was different to Arsene Wenger.\n\nKlopp said: \"He drinks wine, I drink beer.\"\n\nAnd it's a far bet that every bar in Newcastle would have a cold bottle of Brown Ale waiting for him IF the United board went out and showed the world they are interested in putting the city back on the map for the right reasons.\n\nOn the subject of Klopp v Wenger, he also added: \"He likes having the ball, playing football, passes.

Reuters\n\nAll was looking so positive for Bayern Munich ahead of their eagerly anticipated Champions League semifinal against Barcelona. Bayern had mounted a spectacular comeback in their quarterfinal, beating Porto 6-1 in the second leg, before five days later clinching their third successive Bundesliga title. Going into Tuesday's DFB-Pokal semifinal with Borussia Dortmund, the treble was very much on, while manager Pep Guardiola was relishing once again being able to call upon key figure Arjen Robben following five weeks out with injury.\n\nBut in the second half of that fixture at the Allianz Arena, things spectacularly unraveled for the Bavarians. First Dortmund cancelled out Bayern's opener, then Robben, only 16 minutes after making his return off the bench, was forced to limp off with his head in his hands. More misfortune was to follow. In extra-time, Robert Lewandowski took a hefty blow to the head from Dortmund goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak, leaving him unable to take part in a penalty shootout, which Bayern lost without converting a single spot-kick.\n\nTheir treble dream already gone, Bayern's Champions League hopes were thrown into serious jeopardy by the revelations that Robben had torn a calf muscle, while Lewandowski had his nose and jaw fractured. The Dutch winger was instantly ruled out until the end of the season, although both Bayern and the player are hopeful that Lewandowski will be able to take part against Barcelona in the first leg at the Camp Nou next Wednesday.\n\nIt is still far from ideal preparation as Bayern attempt to avoid a repeat of their chastening defeat in last year's Champions League semifinals to Real Madrid. And it also again brings the issue of Bayern's ability to keep their players fit into the spotlight, two weeks after the club's long-time doctor Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt stepped down stating that the medical department had been made a scapegoat for the 3-1 defeat to Porto. Franck Ribery, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber were already on the sidelines, with only Ribery having a chance of returning to take on Barcelona.\n\nIt is Robben who is undoubtedly the biggest loss. When Guardiola first arrived it was reasonable to doubt whether the Dutchman would have a future at Bayern, given his individualistic style seemed in contradiction to Guardiola's possession-based team ethos. Instead Robben has been Bayern's pivotal player, particularly this season, scoring 17 goals and contributing nine assists. So often his direct approach has added much needed variety to Bayern's passing game.\n\nThe task facing Bayern would be sizable, even were they to have the luxury of a fully-fit squad. While Bayern were enduring a night to forget against Dortmund, Barcelona were putting on a breathtaking show to beat Getafe 6-0. Lionel Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar all found the net to take the star trio's goal total for the season to an extraordinary 102 in all competitions. Not only are they undoubtedly the most dangerous front line in the world today, but they are fast moving up the ranks of the greatest in history. At the same time, Barcelona's defense is appearing as resilient as it has done in several seasons, certainly since before Guardiola left the Camp Nou in 2012.\n\nWith domestic dominance now effectively taken for granted, it is in the Champions League where Bayern and Guardiola are judged. A second-straight semifinal defeat after taking over from treble-winning Jupp Heynckes would be a significant disappointment. But if Bayern are to go all the way this year then they will have to do it the hard way. Still, the 6-1 win over Porto, achieved without Robben, Ribery, Alaba, and Bastian Schweinsteiger, showed that Guardiola's ability to devise a winning game plan can never be ruled out.", "Ilkay Gundogan will not renew his contract at Borussia Dortmund, which expires next summer.\n\nThe 24-year-old midfielder was linked with a move to Manchester United during the January transfer window, and now we must wait and see if he will be sold before his contract is up.\n\n[ RELATED: Bayern clinch Bundesliga title ]\n\nGundogan was on the German squad for the 2012 Euro Cup, but did not play.

Fellaini has been a key player in United's restoration to the Premier League's top four. He has done an excellent job for Louis van Gaal, and if my old club return to the Champions League next season, as still looks certain, he will have repaid his \u00a327million transfer fee.\n\nBut in consecutive defeats now, Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and Everton at Goodison on Sunday both realised the best way to stop United was to defend in numbers and crowd out Fellaini in the final third of the pitch.\n\nSince when has one of the biggest clubs in Europe built its team around a 6ft 4in midfielder who provides aerial support to the forwards?\n\nIs that what Manchester United have become?\n\nEverton 3-0 Man United in pictures:\n\nBefore fans turn round and accuse me of being bitter as a member of the Class of '92 who didn't make the first team at Old Trafford, do me a favour.\n\nI love United and the traditions they stand for. I am a big fan.\n\nBut how many of Europe's biggest clubs rely on a 6ft 4in auxiliary forward to produce their best football?\n\nBayern Munich haven't done it since they had Carsten Jancker over a decade ago.\n\nReal Madrid don't do it.\n\nBarcelona don't do it.\n\nAnd hardly any top international teams use a target-man these days, because defenders have worked out how to cut off the supply lines or to deal with any knock-downs.\n\nEngland did okay for a while with Peter Crouch as the tallest poppy in the field, but they were never going to win a World Cup by playing to Crouchy's strengths.\n\nUnited have missed Michael Carrick anchoring the midfield when he's been injured this season, but they have also struggled at Chelsea and Everton, defeats where Fellaini was ineffective.\n\nTo me, that suggests Van Gaal - who has done a fine job by guiding United back into the top four - has worked out his best formation, but does he have a Plan B?\n\nWith two or three ambitious signings this summer - I have mentioned Gareth Bale and Edinson Cavani as priority targets previously in this column - I still think they can challenge for the title next season.\n\nAs things stand - seven points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and two behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand - I would say they will finish fourth this season.\n\nYes, that's a significant improvement on last year, but I cannot believe fourth place, with Fellaini as the central piece of the jigsaw, is enough for a club of their stature.\n\nIt should only be the bare minimum.\n\nPoll loading ...", "It was the day after Aston Villa's FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool and Tom Fox was still on \"cloud nine\" when he stood over the 13th tee at St Andrews, weighed up the 142 yards to the pin and took out a seven iron. \"I knew the minute I hit it that it was a good shot,\" the Villa chief executive says. \"I was screaming all kinds of things at it to get in the hole, it bounced a couple of times and rolled in. I looked over at my friend who I've known almost my whole life and we just laughed.\"\n\nOn the back of a hole-in-one at the spiritual home of golf, fewer than 24 hours after Villa had upset the odds to reach their first FA Cup final in 15 years, Fox could be forgiven for thinking this was the moment when all his stars were in alignment. \"I bought two lottery tickets afterwards but it didn't work,\" he says, smiling.\n\nSitting in his office at Villa Park, Fox is on good form. This is the American's first interview with a national newspaper since he left his role as Arsenal's chief commercial officer last summer to accept Randy Lerner's offer to take over the day-to-day running of Villa, and he comes across as man who is fiercely determined to deliver success and not expecting a tap on the shoulder any time soon to say the Midlands club will be in new hands.\n\nFox breaks into laughter when it is put to him there is a school of thought that the FA Cup final against Arsenal on 30 May could be Lerner's last game as Villa's owner. \"I really don't know how to respond to that,\" he says, smiling. \"I think I'd know if there was a sale imminent.\"\n\nAfter several questions aimed at getting to the bottom of the takeover situation, Fox says: \"Look, there may be people out there who in their own mind think they want to buy Aston Villa. It's nothing that we know about it. People are trying to fill the void of information with something. And I'm not suggesting you are irresponsible for asking these questions, but a lot of what is being said out there is just borderline irresponsible.\n\n\"I look at some of the things that are being written about the ownership and I just laugh. 'Rich person interested in buying Villa.' Of course there is. Why is that news? Tell me who it is, tell me what his offer is, tell me he's engaged actively with the bank to do that, and that there's actually engagement on the other side, and then you might have a story. I've haven't seen any of those things happening.\"\n\nFox says he hopes Lerner will be Villa's owner \"for a long, long time\". He speaks to his countryman pretty much every day - \"sometimes Randy will wake up in the middle of the night with a couple of thoughts in his head\" - and it is measure of how strong their relationship is that he describes Lerner as a \"friend\".\n\nHe makes the point that Lerner, aged 53, is only a year older than him, which means they have plenty in common. \"At one point Randy and I are going back and forth on email and he's quoting Dylan lyrics and I'm going back with Steely Dan lyrics.\"\n\nLerner has visited the Bodymoor Heath training ground twice since Tim Sherwood replaced Paul Lambert as manager in February, yet the billionaire is rarely seen at Villa Park these days and it is hard to escape the feeling that a man who put the club up for sale last summer no longer has the same level of interest.\n\nFox disagrees. \"He's not here as frequently, then you've made the leap to he's detached and he's lost interest. The fact is he's got things happening in his personal life that mean he isn't here as often. He's raising a son in New York City, he's got other projects, he makes his living in New York. I've never quite understood that leap: 'If he's not here, then he's suddenly not as engaged.' He knows everything that's happening at this football club, he's unbelievably passionate about it. When I called him after the FA Cup semi-final [which Lerner missed because of a bereavement], you should have heard it in his voice, it was fantastic.\"\n\nPointing to the financial fair play rules introduced in 2013, Fox says it is misguided to think a wealthy benefactor could replace Lerner and transform Villa's fortunes. \"Even if he wanted to, an owner could not come in under the current financial regime that exists within the Premier League and invest as much money as Randy has in the club. It wouldn't be allowed any more because of the profitability and sustainability rules.\n\n\"So if Randy decides to sell the club in the future, no matter who comes in, the plan will most likely be the same because you can't come in and spend money on players the way clubs used to in the Premier League. You can invest money in infrastructure. Well, guess what? Randy Lerner did quite bit of that over the years. So that won't change.\n\n\"The plan that we've got in place with the management team we're building here, that plan will be the same, to maximise the revenue potential of the Aston Villa club brand on a global basis and to spend that money very effectively by putting experts into all the key areas of football operations.\"\n\nAfter five successive years spent fighting relegation, Fox says Lerner \"now sees some light at the end of the tunnel with where we're headed\". Villa are not out of the woods this season - they are only two points and two places above the bottom three prior to Everton's visit on Saturday - but there is a renewed sense of optimism about the way the players are performing.\n\nIt was Fox who made the call to sack Lambert. The previous month he had publicly backed the Scot and said it was a \"false narrative\" to blame the manager, yet the sight of Villa sliding inexorably towards the relegation zone and playing so poorly forced a rethink. He made up his mind that a change had to be made, called Lerner \"who asked some critical questions, like any good chairman would do\", and had the owner's backing to dismiss Lambert. \"I looked at the situation and thought: 'It doesn't appear as if anything we're doing collectively, Paul included, is going to change where we're headed right now.'\"\n\nAdamant from the outset that he wanted to make a long-term appointment, Fox travelled to Hertfordshire to meet Sherwood at his home and after three hours of talks drove back to the Midlands convinced he had found the right man to re-energise Villa and galvanise a group of players whose confidence was shot to bits.\n\n\"When we met, Tim started immediately talking about the squad: 'Why is he doing this? Why he is playing there? How come he's not in the squad?'\" Fox says. \"And he's very good with the psychology of the team. Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to multiple championships in the NBA, one of his quotes was: 'The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.' So you're stronger as a team if you're all together. But you have to understand each other as individuals. And Tim really understands what players need on an individual basis to get the most out of them within the team dynamic.\"\n\nFox does not, however, seek any credit for Sherwood's appointment. \"We got really lucky. I made the decision that I thought was the right decision at the time and it just so happened that there was a manager named Tim Sherwood available and that when I sat down and talked with him we were able to create a rapport. But Tim could have signed with QPR and I don't know what we would have done and where we would have been. So I think we got lucky because he was available.\"\n\nFrom his discussions with the fans prior to Sherwood's arrival - \"Some of the feedback I've solicited, some of it unsolicited, which I still appreciate\" he says, laughing - Fox was left in little doubt how supporters felt about the team's performances. \"Everyone said this is very difficult to watch.\"\n\nUnder Sherwood Villa look like a totally different proposition, with Saturday's narrow 3-2 defeat at Manchester City a case in point. \"Football's cruel. But you learn to take the positives,\" Fox says. \"I love the way that we fought back, that's the type of team I think we are now. We can score, we can control the ball, we can put teams on the back foot, and that's encouraging and fun to watch. So I know we can stay up if we do what we're capable of and that's a much better place to be in than a position where we need help. We don't need help. We can do it ourselves.\"\n\nChristian Benteke's return to form has been a feature of Villa's revival under Sherwood and Fox agrees with the manager that the club cannot afford to get in a position where the Belgian's contractual situation - he has two years remaining on his deal - is not addressed this summer.\n\nAsked whether Villa plan to offer Benteke a new contract, Fox replies: \"Absolutely. He's young, he's unplayable on his day, he's incredibly important. I talk to his agent on a fairly regular basis. We're not doing anything on it right now - we're focused on the end of the season and the FA Cup - but Tim is 100% right: you don't allow your players that are big assets at the club to be in a position where the club is disadvantaged, so you want to have them signed long term. I'm sure we'll be having conversations with Christian and his people in the summer.\"\n\nFox offers a bullish response to the question of whether it is realistic to think Villa can keep one of the Premier League's most prolific goalscorers over the last three seasons. \"Look, I think the problem is people lately think of Villa as a club fighting relegation and being 15th or 16th. I look at Villa and see a club that should be seventh, eighth or ninth in the Premier League on a perennial basis, and that's what we're all trying to do, put the club in a place where that's possible.\n\n\"I think if we put ourselves in that position we can keep any player. I think we have to [make a real play] to keep Christian in the summer.\"\n\nUnderachievement at Villa Park, Fox says, has not been confined to results on the pitch. Although there is no prospect of pulling off the sort of multimillion-pound deals he negotiated at Arsenal in his five years at the Emirates, Fox believes that Villa can increase their commercial revenue streams by \u00a38m-\u00a310m per year and he goes on to produce a remarkable statistic to support his theory that the club should aim to be the best of the rest outside the top six.\n\n\"That's exactly where we belong and I'll tell you why,\" he says. \"Compare Aston Villa in terms of global viewers who watch our matches to every other club in European football, excluding the top six in the Premier League, and where do you think we rank? Third. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Aston Villa. More people watched Aston Villa on a global basis last year than would have seen Bayern Munich. That's the power of the Premier League.\"\n\nFox remains confident Villa will still be playing in the top flight next season and assuming those relegation fears are allayed he can look forward to renewing acquaintances with some familiar faces at Wembley. \"To be in the most iconic, oldest tournament of its type, Villa and Arsenal, to me it's classic,\" Fox says, smiling. \"I'll feel really good being in that stadium with another great club, like Arsenal, and I'll feel even better if we win it.\"", "It would appear to have been a good week for Financial Fair Play with headlines of how the Premier League clubs have turned loss into profit for the first time in 16 years and are now being run on far sounder business principles.\n\nNo-one would argue against this - especially when one of the key reasons is the long-overdue curbing of player pay. It is ridiculous that clubs in the world's richest league have been running at a loss.\n\nBut is it a good week for football? Has it, in fact, been a good season for football? Has it been a good season for the competitiveness of the Premier League - a competition which, after all, markets itself as the most competitive league in the world?\n\nIs the trend towards preserving an elite at the top now, actually, accelerating? It does not appear that all the fears about FFP helping to preserve and strengthen the status quo have now been realised.\n\nOne of the best-run clubs in this country is Southampton. They have a plan; they have a structure; they have an identity; they have a wealthy backer.\n\nSouthampton have performed superbly - but are still finding the top four a step too far\n\nThe latest set of accounts for St Mary's Football Group Ltd, who own the club, show that Southampton also have only the 11th highest turnover in the league at \u00a3106million and the joint 14th highest wage bill of \u00a363million which is 59 per cent of revenue well within guidelines. That was for 2013-14.\n\nSouthampton over-achieved last season and have over-achieved this season: they have defied predictions of a relegation battle, with Ronald Koeman a strong candidate for manager of the season. They have recruited smartly, improved the balance sheet and have a clear identity.\n\nAnd yet Southampton will probably finish seventh. Seventh. It is not finishing second as they did in 1983-84, just three points behind a formidable Liverpool side.\n\nThe point is this: the Premier League has become predictable. And that predictability is in danger of making it boring.\n\nThe Premier League will understandably argue that Chelsea are poised to become the third different title winner in three years - after Manchester City last season and Manchester United the year before. But the league within the league is a real issue.\n\nChelsea are on course for another Premier League title\n\nThe adage is that everyone can beat anyone in the Premier League but not over the course of a 38-game season they can't. The financial muscle flexes.\n\nIt is not a new argument but it can be made again, especially in light of the FFP rules which prevent the emergence of a Jack Walker at Blackburn Rovers or even a Mohamed Al Fayed at Fulham.\n\nThe ladder has well and truly been pulled up. Clubs can compete - but not for the title. That will only now be won by one of five clubs - and even that is an optimistic assessment. Others can deliver a bloody nose now and again but not a knock-out blow.\n\nIn the three seasons before the formation of the Premier League 10 different clubs finished in the top five with Arsenal the only one to make it for all three seasons, winning the title once.\n\nHow have clubs' league positions changed between this season and last season? Club Change in position Chelsea 2 Liverpool -3 Manchester City -3 Arsenal 2 Everton -5 Tottenham 0 Man Utd 4 Southampton -1 Stoke 0 Newcastle -4 Crystal Palace -1 Swansea 4 West Ham 2 Sunderland -4 Aston Villa -1 Hull 1 West Brom 4\n\nIn the three years after the formation of the Premier League in 1992-93 it remained at 10 different clubs with only Manchester United and Blackburn making it on all three occasions.\n\nIn the past three seasons - four if including 2014-15 - there have been eight different clubs in the top five which sounds reasonably healthy but, crucially, two of those clubs have been or will be in the top five every time (Manchester City and Arsenal) and two more have done it three times (United and Chelsea).\n\nEssentially, there is no churn.\n\nThat point is reinforced by the fact that as the Premier League table stands this morning a third of the clubs that were in the division last season are in either exactly the same position as last season or just one place different.\n\nThe elite only drop out of the top six through catastrophic failure - such as Chelsea in 2011-12 when they finished sixth but won the Champions League - or United last season. But even that is temporary. Such is their financial dominance that they cannot drop out for long.\n\nThe top five is the top five; a top six when Spurs come into it. They are the elite and will remain so. It is now set in stone by FFP. A competition of six clubs does not sound so bad but even within that six there is a hierarchy. United, City, Chelsea then Arsenal. Then Liverpool. Then Spurs.\n\n* 'Boring' Chelsea worthy champions\n\nThe Premier League will rightly argue that it is a better hit-rate than other major European leagues such as Spain, Italy, France and especially Germany which is now so dominated by Bayern Munich that it appears a monopoly.\n\nBut the problem for the Premier League is the elitism is accelerating. Over the past 11 seasons Arsenal have been in the top five every time and both Chelsea and Manchester United have appeared 10 times. Liverpool will probably achieve that feat for a seventh time this season unless they are pipped by Spurs for whom it would also be a seventh time.\n\n* Who could be Liverpool's marquee summer signing?\n\nAlan Pardew's Newcastle were the only real rank outsiders to have achieved a top-five finish in the past decade - although Roberto Martinez's Everton did it last season from not such a marginal position.\n\nManchester City muscled their way in in 2009-10 and have been there ever since but FFP has now effectively closed that window of opportunity for others.\n\nHow top four finishes have divided in last 10 seasons Club Top four finishes Man Utd 9 Man City 4 Arsenal 10 Tottenham 2 Chelsea 9 Liverpool 5 Everton 1\n\nIt is not a new claim to say there are now leagues within leagues but the trend has accelerated. United won the first Premier League in 1992-93 but who were the next four clubs? Aston Villa, Norwich City, Blackburn and Queens Park Rangers.\n\nBack then it felt as if it was more competitive. Other clubs had a chance. But do they any more?\n\nIt is not the Premier League's fault. And it is difficult to see what can now be done especially when the situation is being mirrored in European competition with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich perennially reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has helped make Real Madrid dominant in Spain\n\nIt may not market itself as such but the Premier League probably, as an organisation, prefers to have the security of the big clubs being at the top. Given the worldwide profile of United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, they probably prefer the guarantee that they will head the league.\n\nNo-one would claim that the football being played in the Premier League is boring. But the predictability of its outcome, if not necessarily its winner, is in danger of being so.", "Jose Mourinho's side is poised to win another title using an approach that is less than thrilling ENLARGE Chelsea's John Terry, left, celebrates with teammates after scoring at Leicester City on Wednesday.

The only remaining question was when. Turns out the answer is probably Sunday afternoon.\n\nChelsea will mathematically secure the championship with three games to spare if it beats 12th-place Crystal Palace this weekend. But for the rest of the league, the title race has felt over for months.\n\nThat is because Chelsea has delivered a master class this season in how to control a 38-game campaign: Bring down the hammer in the first half of the season, focus on dirty work in the second.\n\nIt isn't pretty. It certainly isn't dramatic. But it works.\n\nPremier League\n\nTop five teams entering Saturday (top four qualify for UEFA Champions League)\n\n1. Chelsea (24-8-2, +41): 80 points 2. Manchester City (20-7-7, +34): 67 3. Arsenal (20-7-6, +31): 67 4. Manchester United (19-8-7, +25): 65 5. Liverpool (17-7-10, +10): 58\n\n\"Do you think in the Premier League, there is one manager who will say that Chelsea don't deserve to be champions?\" Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said.\n\nOver the first 19 games of the Premier League season, Chelsea collected points at an average of 2.42 a game. (Victories are worth three points; draws yield one.) Across Europe's top five professional leagues, only Real Madrid and Bayern Munich did better in the opening half of league play.\n\nAt that point of the season, Mourinho -- a notoriously defensive-minded manager -- was permitting the Blues to play a more wide-open game. They scored at least twice in 14 of their first 19 matches and piled up the points.\n\nMeanwhile, the challengers never materialized. Manchester City's title defense turned into a damp squib. Manchester United took half the season to adapt under first-year manager Louis van Gaal. Arsenal, decimated by injury through the fall, didn't perk up until January.\n\n\"We were the best side by far up until Christmas,\" Chelsea captain John Terry said.\n\nThe turning point seemed to be a 5-3 free-for-all defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day. That was the end of Chelsea's experiment with wide-open soccer. In seven of its last 10 league games, Chelsea hasn't scored more than a single goal -- grinding out points in close-to-the-vest matches instead.\n\nAs Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said upon discovering that Chelsea had beaten Manchester United 1-0 this month, \"The usual.\"\n\nENLARGE Chelsea star Eden Hazard with manager Jose Mourinho. Photo: Eddie Keogh/Action Images/Zuma Press\n\nNothing sums up Chelsea's brutal efficiency in 2015 like its grim pairing of defensive midfielders -- Ramires, of Brazil, and Serbia's Nemanja Matic. When Mourinho puts them in the same lineup, any pretense of free-flowing soccer goes out the window.\n\nNo midfielder in the Premier League who plays as much as Matic has attempted more tackles this season. Ramires, meanwhile, is well-known as an expert of the tactical foul -- the casual trip or bump that stops play and defuses a counterattack.\n\nMourinho didn't start them together in that role until Jan. 31 of this year, but he has done it a further six times over the next 10 games. Chelsea is undefeated in those starts.\n\n\"For me, the beautiful game is to go to every game and know exactly the way you have to play and what you have to do,\" Mourinho said following a 0-0 draw Sunday at Arsenal. \"At Arsenal we were brilliant.\"\n\nAt the other end of the field, Chelsea has leaned on the brilliance of Belgian Eden Hazard. A year ago, rumors were flying that Hazard could be on his way out of the club. Sluggish in practice -- Mourinho said in early 2014 that he had been one of his \"worst trainers\" -- he was only improving slowly.\n\nThis season, the Hazard-Mourinho relationship has become the Premier League's answer to a great quarterback-coach combination. And, just like an NFL coach, Mourinho is constantly in his star player's ear.\n\nFor a player in creative role, one that hinges so much on improvisation, Hazard seems micromanaged at all times. With nine minutes remaining in the Arsenal game, Mourinho was still calling out \"Eden!\" from the dugout. Once again, he had instructions. Hazard wearily nodded along, as he always does, before making a subtle adjustment to his position.\n\nWhatever he gleans from those instructions seems to be working. Hazard was voted player of the year by the Professional Footballers' Association last week, and his league goals in 2015 have been worth 10 points to his club. He has been the linchpin of Chelsea's 14-game unbeaten streak.\n\nMore Soccer\n\nSoccer Violence Escalates in Europe Improvement, but No Silver Lining for Arsenal Barcelona, Real Madrid Kept Apart in Champions League Semifinals Su\u00e1rez, Messi, Neymar: Barcelona's Three Amigos\n\nThough Mourinho grew up as a manager in the culture of pretty, passing soccer at Barcelona -- he served as an assistant coach there in the 1990s -- he evolved in the opposite direction. Ball possession, he likes to remind people, means nothing without goals.\n\n\"Maybe the future of football is a beautiful green grass carpet without goals. And in that beautiful grass pitch, the team with more ball possession wins the game,\" Mourinho said this week, responding to accusations that Chelsea had become boring.\n\n\"Sometimes we speak about boring, and you consider boring a team that scores as many goals as we do.

He won the Bundesliga and German Cup in his first season before reaching the Champions League final in his second.\n\nInjury saw him miss virtually all of last season and Germany's World Cup triumph but the 24-year-old has returned to form in recent months.\n\nGundogan scored a penalty in the German Cup semi-final shootout win over Bayern at the weekend but the final looks set to be his last game at the club.", "Munich - Top-seed Andy Murray eased his way into the quarter-finals of Munich's ATP tournament on Thursday with a straight sets win over qualifier Mischa Zverev to begin his French Open preparations.\n\nBritain's world number three needed just 74 minutes to enjoy a 6-2, 6-2 win over the Russian-born German qualifier, who is ranked 650 places below the Scot, to start his clay-court season to prepare for Roland Garros.\n\nHaving dominated the first set, Murray had more problems dealing with the 27-year-old left-hander Zverev in the second, but still defended all six break points he faced for a comfortable victory.\n\n\"It wasn't too easy, he had a different style to most other players and it was tricky playing against a left-hander, but I got the important points,\" said the Scotsman, who is also playing doubles in Munich.\n\n\"He was returning from a long way back.\n\n\"My forehand went better than my backhand, but it was a good first match for me.\"\n\nThis was Murray's first singles match since marrying Kim Sears earlier this month.

It looks like the cliche of no easy games, with West Brom and Hull fighting relegation, Arsenal ahead of United and Palace rejuvenated under Alan Pardew.\n\nBut Hull's fate could be decided before the final day, Palace were recently beaten at home by Steve Bruce's men and Arsenal are usually bad travellers.\n\nSo how many points do they need?\n\nMathematically they need six points to secure a top four finish, or two wins from their final four games.\n\nA significantly better goal difference than fifth and sixth knocks that down to five points. So two wins would still do it, or a win and two draws. A good fortnight for United will mean they can qualify before Arsenal visit Old Trafford.\n\nWhat about the teams around them?\n\nThe wait will be also cut if their rivals fail to take maximum points from their remaining games, which there's a decent chance of.\n\nLiverpool's current league form reads: WLLWDL. Rodgers' team face QPR and Palace at home and face difficult away trips to Chelsea and Stoke, making the chances of them taking 12 points unlikely.\n\nSpurs have not fared much better. Their league form is: LWDLWD. They face City at home, Stoke away, Hull at home and Everton away.\n\nSouthampton , eight points behind United, face Sunderland, Leicester and City away, and Villa at home.\n\nThere's also other top four teams to consider. Arsenal and City sit just two points ahead of United, so if the Reds can manage one more win than either of those two that is another way they can ensure they qualify.\n\nWho could United face next season?\n\nUEFA have introduced a new rule for the group stages which means the top eight seeds will be made up of league champions.\n\nIf United make the draw they could be drawn against any of these teams other than the English champions, which is looking like it will be Chelsea. As things stand, these are the sides that are topping their divisions.\n\nSpain: Barcelona lead Real Madrid by two points with four games to go.\n\nGermany: Bayern Munich have won the Bundesliga.\n\nItaly: Juventus lead Lazio by 14 points with five games to go.\n\nPortugal: Benfica lead Porto by three points with four games to go.\n\nFrance: PSG lead Lyon by three points with four games to go.\n\nRussia: Zenit lead Krasnodar by eight points with five games to go.\n\nNetherlands: PSV have won the Dutch league.\n\nIf Barcelona, Real Madrid or Juventus win the Champions League but DO NOT win their domestic league, they will be included in the top eight seeds at the expense of PSV.\n\nPoll loading ...", "Barcelona executive says Fifa should avoid sanctions: \"If we have three teams that can't sign players the football world will collapse.\"\n\nCarles Rexach gave an interview on Thursday with Esports Cope in which je spoke about the current situation at the club. In statements picked up by Mundo Deportivo, the Barcelona executive spoke about Dani Alves' contract impasse at Camp Nou.\n\n\"I am one of those that sees him here. I'm convinced Dani Alves will remain at Barcelona,\" Rexach said.\n\nThe former player, who starred in the Johan Cruyff-led team of the 1970s and later served as assistant coach in the Dream Team era, also held forth on Luis Enrique: \"He will see out his contract. He is doing a great job; he has achieved the best statistics in the history of the club. What more can we ask for?\"\n\n\"The team couldn't be doing any better, everybody is available, we're playing really well and our rivals have a few problems. If there is any advantage [with injuries etc] then so much the better. The wind is favourable,\" Rexach said.\n\nLooking ahead to the Champions League clash against Bayern Munich, Rexach noted: \"Guardiola is worried. He has had the scare in the cup, we all thought that he could win. That just goes to show that in football there are always surprises. I think Bar\u00e7a are favourites because I've looked at the styles of play of the two teams and if there is little space and [Bayern] want to pressure a lot, Bar\u00e7a have players that can go on the break quickly. But we will have to wait and see what surprises Guardiola has in store for us.\"\n\nFinally, speaking about the possibility of sanctions being imposed by other Liga teams by Fifa for alleged irregularities in the signing of youth team players, Rexach prescribed a softer stance. \"They have to absolve everyone. Barcelona have already lost out and the best solution is to absolve everyone because if we have three teams [in La Liga] that can't sign players then the football world will collapse.\"", "It's still unclear where Paul Pogba will be when next season begins, but it looks increasingly likely that he won't be with Juventus.\n\nThe Italian giants reportedly agreed an $89 million fee with Paris Saint-Germain for the French midfielder. While the price has been set, no contract terms have been set with the player, according to Goal.com.\n\nSubsequently, it remains to be seen if Pogba will return to his native France. Both Chelsea and Manchester City are reportedly interested in the 22-year-old.\n\nPSG is attempting to swoop in early for the player. The club's president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, reportedly met with Pogba and his representatives sometime this week.\n\nFollowing Juventus' 3-2 win against Fiorentina on Wednesday, sporting director Giuseppe Marotta acknowledged the meeting to reporters, but insisted the club does not want to sell Pogba.\n\nHere are some more of Thursday afternoon's news and notes:\n\nNO GUNDOGAN EXTENSION AT DORTMUND BEYOND 2016\n\nIkay Gundogan is under contract with Borussia Dortmund until June 2016, but the midfielder's time with the club will not extend any further than that date.\n\nThe club announced Thursday that Gundogan has opted not to sign an extension, signaling an end to the midfielder's stay with the team.\n\nGundogan returned to action this past October following a 14-moth absence due to injury. The 24-year-old has since made 28 appearances for the club, providing three goals and four assists.\n\nNews of Gundogan's impending departure comes just two weeks after manager Jurgen Klopp announced that he will be leaving the club at season's end.\n\nMATTHAUS BLAMES GUARDIOLA FOR LOSS TO DORTMUND\n\nAs one of the game's more revered tacticians, Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola usually gets things right when it comes to setting his team up for success. However, German legend Lothar Matthaus believes the Spanish manager got it all wrong in the team's DFB Pokal loss to Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBayern was defeated, 2-0, on penalty kicks after the game finished 1-1 in regular time, sending the Bundesliga champions crashing out of the tournament's semifinal stage. Matthaus believes such a result was not inevitable, and was simply down to a string of errors from the team's manager.\n\n\"I really rate Guardiola and I think he is the perfect guy for Bayern, but he got it all wrong against Dortmund,\" Matthaus said. \"Why did Rafinha play on the left? And why did [Philipp] Lahm not start on the right wing like against Porto? Why did [Xabi] Alonso not start as No.6? Why were [Juan] Bernat and [Medhi] Benatia played out of position? [Thomas] Muller as a false nine?\n\n\"Had all of them played in their natural position, Bayern would not only have dominated, but they would have decided the game. Why did Pep take off Thiago and Muller? They were two certainties when it comes to penalties. He apparently thought the game would not go to penalties.\"\n\nSCHNEIDERLIN TO MISS REST OF SEASON\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin has put together some impressive performance for Southampton this season, but that season has come to the end for the French midfielder.\n\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman announced Thursday that Schneiderlin will be out of action for the remainder of the campaign due to a knee injury. The injury is expected to take four to five weeks to heal.\n\n\"He is a key player, so it is disappointing,\" Koeman said. \"It is the ligaments of his left knee and that is a shame because he's out for the last part of the season.\"\n\nSchneiderlin has featured 30 times for Southampton this year, scoring five goals from a central midfield position.\n\nJOHNSON EXPECTING TO DEPART LIVERPOOL\n\nHaving been a member of the club since 2009, Glen Johnson believes his time at Liverpool is coming to a close.\n\nThe fullback says that he expects to depart the club at the expiration of his contract, which concludes this summer. Johnson has started the past three games for Liverpool, but was absent from the team's lineup for the previous 15 games.\n\n\"Of course [I expect to leave at the end of the season], I have no contract,\" Johnson told The Liverpool Echo. \"I don't think that will change but we have to wait and see.\n\n\"I have always been professional all season, always wanted to play and that's still what I'm doing. I've got four more games and then let's see what we do in the summer.\"\n\nJohnson believes Liverpool are in for a major overhaul, one that will include his departure, as the club look to move past a disappointing season that will likely see a lack of Champions League qualification.\n\n\"There need to be changes,\" Johnson said. \"It's the same every year and every team is going to try and do their business in the summer to try and make themselves stronger for the following the season. The club needs to do that, too.\n\n\"We have some fantastic young players, but we say the same every year - we always have some good young players coming through. The club has got some business to do in the summer with current players and new players, and it's just about trying to get the squad as strong as possible for the start.\"\n\nWhere should Pogba go next, if he does not stay with Juventus? What do you think of Matthaus' assessment of Guardiola's choices? How will Southampton fare without Schneiderlin as the season winds down? Who do you expect Liverpool to bring in during the summer transfer window?", "DORTMUND, Germany -- Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is set to leave Borussia Dortmund after turning down an offer to extend his contract past 2016.\n\nDortmund says Gundogan has \"decided not to extend his contract.\" Dortmund is likely to try to get a transfer fee after the season, rather than let one of its key players leave for free at the end of his contract next season.\n\nDortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said last weekend that the club would let Gundogan go if it received an \"adequate offer.\"\n\nGundogan is the third Dortmund star to leave the club, after Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski departed in successive seasons for rival Bayern Munich.\n\nDortmund coach Juergen Klopp is also leaving, to be replaced by Thomas Tuchel.", "PRINCETON: Gas pipeline will shut down as new line is installed TRAVEL SOCCER ROUND-UP\n\nThe U12 Hopewell Windstorm took a come-from-behind 3-2 victory against Hunterdon FC Bayern Munich in their spring travel soccer opener.

Bundesliga giant Bayern Munich for a shot at their fifth UEFA Champions League trophy.\n\nRecommended"], "2015-05-01": ["Bayern Munich pick up more injuries ahead of Leverkusen, Barcelona tests\n\nThe bulk of the post-Porto euphoria has finally evaporated. Freshly-crowned Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich quite literally slipped to defeat against Dortmund in the German Cup on Tuesday night, leaving their treble hopes in disarray.\n\nAnd yet there's no time for sulking as its back to the day job. Bundesliga action continues despite Bayern wrapping up the title last Sunday afternoon without even needing to kick a ball following Wolfsburg's defeat at Borussia Monchengladbach. The champions next travel to Leverkusen, a side they beat a few weeks ago in a penalty shootout in the previous round of the German Cup.\n\nIronically, that night on the Rhein all five penalty takers converted with aplomb while on Tuesday in Munich against BVB, all four Bayern shooters failed horribly from the spot. Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso did their best John Terry impressions, slipping on the wet grass and firing high into the night sky. Mario Gotze at least tested the keeper before Bayern's Number One Manuel Neuer blasted against the crossbar, rounding off a bizarre chain of events. Perhaps penalty shootouts in the Allianz Arena are best avoided. Bayern fans are still trying to erase memories of the \"Fiasko dahoam\" 2012 Champions League final heartache against Chelsea.\n\nReferee Peter Gagelmann admitted after the BVB game that he should have awarded a penalty when Marcel Schmelzer clearly handled in the box. The 46-year-old official has since said sorry but Bayern will know this is a game that they should have won without the need for such decisions. Like that fateful night against Chelsea, Bayern have only themselves to blame for not finishing off Jurgen Klopp's side over the 120 minutes. Bastian Schweinsteiger should have done better with his two headers in extra time, while Gotze missed an open goal with just a few minutes remaining.\n\nWith all the frustration over the latest additions to the injury list (more about that later), news of Javi Martinez's long-awaited return may have slipped under the radar. The Spanish midfielder injured knee ligaments back in August in the Super Cup defeat against Dortmund. He has been absent ever since but finally took his place on the bench against Hertha at the weekend, one of five Spanish substitutes alongside Juan Bernat, Xabi Alonso, Pepe Reina and Thiago.\n\nMartinez may make his return against Leverkusen and we can also expect outings for the unsung Sebastian Rode, defensive scapegoat Dante, last week's debutant Sinan Kurt and 18-year-old Gianluca Gaudino. Mitchell Weiser looks set for a fourth Bundesliga start in a row; the 20-year-old is playing for a new deal as his contract is up for renewal. Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro, in his ninth season at Bayern, can also expect some game time up front.\n\nA player with his own catalogue of injury setbacks is Arjen Robben. According to Whoscored's sorry stat, the fragile Dutchman has only started 50 percent of Bayern's Bundesliga games (100 out of 200) since signing from Real Madrid in 2009. In Monday's press conference, coach Pep Guardiola said that Robben wasn't a \"joker\" (i.e. a player that is often as an impact substitute) but hopefully, the decision to bring on Robben as a substitute had nothing to do with the pre-match entertainment before the Borussia Dortmund game when Bayern paid their respects to their missing Frenchman (Franck Ribery) and Dutch star with a special \"Batman and Robben\" choreography.\n\nIt does beggar belief that Thiago, incidentally the Bavarians' best player up till that point, was sacrificed for the Dutchman. Bayern were cruising and deservedly led 1-0 through Robert Lewandowski's fine finish. Just 16 minutes later, not only had Dortmund equalised but Robben was down injured and out for the season with a torn calf muscle. Whatever the reason, the decision to rush Robben back into the fold has backfired horribly.\n\nJust when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Bayern then suffered another knockout blow with Lewandowski emerging second best following a hefty challenge from Mitchell Langerak as penalties loomed. While the BVB keeper has since apologised to the striker via text message, the Aussie didn't need to. Football is still a contact sport and it is still the goalkeeper's prerogative to try and win the ball in his area. Unfortunately for the Bayern striker, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and has a broken jaw and nose plus a concussion as the painful evidence of his efforts.\n\nThe loss of Lewandowski and Robben is a double blow for Bayern ahead of the Champions League semifinal with Barcelona. Although the away leg may come too soon for Lewandowski's shattered jaw, there are positive noises coming from the Bayern camp that the in-form striker could make a return in Munich on May 12. That said, it is a huge ask for a player to come back so soon and battle for 50-50 balls or headers, for that matter, with such an injury. If he does make it, we'll probably witness the Polish striker wearing one of those famous protective \"Gazza\" masks.\n\nWith the club's 24th Bundesliga title already safely in the bag, it really doesn't matter if Bayern lose on Saturday in Leverkusen. However, ahead of the Champions League clash in Barcelona, another couple of injuries to their first-choice line up would be potentially devastating. Therefore we can expect a very experimental Bayern XI will take to the field on the Rhein.", "Abu Dhabi // Europe's most coveted football trophy made its first UAE appearance in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Yas Mall on Friday.\n\nThe crowd gathered for the unveiling of the Uefa Champions League trophy, awarded each year to the winner of the world's most prestigious club football competition.\n\nThe event was a prelude to the Uefa Champions League Experience, a retail and casual-dining outlet opening next month at the mall, said Leigh-Ann Lanier, director of strategic marketing for Marka, one of the groups behind the new concept.\n\nBringing the new football attraction to Abu Dhabi was the logical choice thanks to the sport's popularity in the region, Ms Lanier said.\n\n\"We know football is the number one sport in terms of viewership,\" she said. \"It's a sport that kids grow up with.\"\n\nShe said, they were looking to generate a buzz in the lead up to this year's Champions League final, which is set for June 6 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\n\"What better way to do this than by bringing the trophy to Yas Mall,\" she said. \"We've seen the tremendous passion that fans have here.\"\n\nAn orchestra of violins, cellos, drums and horns played the Champion's League theme song, with operatic singers, as the trophy was taken before a large audience of all ages.\n\nMany football fans were in awe of the large silver trophy, which stands 73.5cm tall, weighs 7.5kg, and has the names of every team to have won it engraved on it.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" said Jordanian Waleed Khalid, 33. \"We've been waiting a long time for this.\"\n\nAfter its appearance over the weekend in Abu Dhabi, the trophy will travel to Berlin, where it will soon be held by this season's winners. The competition is at the semi-final stage, with Italian club Juventus going up against Real Madrid, and Barcelona taking on German giants Bayern Munich in this week's first legs.\n\nAll sporting the colours of Bayern Munich, the Marshall family from the United States, were at the mall to see the trophy.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" said Laura Marshall, a mother of two.\n\n\"We're hoping to be the good luck charms that will draw the trophy to Bayern.\"\n\n\"It's bigger than I expected,\" said her husband, Jeff, of the famed silverware.\n\nShowing his temporary tattoo of the Champions League logo, Ali Al Jaberi, 30, came to see the trophy that he hopes will be carried by his favourite team, Real Madrid.\n\n\"This is a great moment,\" he said. \"This is fantastic.\"\n\nesamoglou@thenational.ae", "At the Stadio Olimpico, they can almost hear the first notes of the Uefa Champions League anthem.\n\nThere will be group stage football, at least, in Europe's principal competition in Italy's capital next season.\n\nThere may be a double dose of it if both Roma and Lazio join Juventus, the Serie A champions-elect, in the tournament.\n\nThe joust between them is heating up.\n\nWhich of the pair gains the automatic place awarded to the eventual runner-up in the table, or risks the lottery of a qualifying play-off as the third place finisher, may run all the way to their derby meeting on May 24, or even the season's last round of fixtures.\n\nLazio players have not lined up to attention to the trademark tune of European Cup football since 2007. Roma's current crop would rather forget the last two occasions they did so at the Olimpico, the autumn defeats by Manchester City and Bayern Munich, the latter thrashing them 7-1.\n\nFor Roma, those games were signs of flaws that have since been regularly revealed through a season that started with great promise and has wheezed downhill since.\n\nFor Lazio, quite the contrary. They may well be the most electrifying team in Italy to watch right now, and they take on Atalanta tomorrow looking to consolidate second place and continue a run in which they have lost once in their past 13 games across competitions.\n\nThey also have an Italian Cup final to look forward to, against Juventus, in June.\n\nThe main pilots of the Lazio juggernaut are a couple men you might expect to pacing themselves, panting wearily at this stage of the campaign.\n\nNot a bit of it from Miroslav Klose, who will celebrate his 37th birthday next month.\n\nThe German retired from international football last July, having just established himself as the highest scorer in World Cup finals tournaments and collected a winner's medal from his last one.\n\nHe is not only Lazio's leading marksman this season but has appeared in more games for his club than anybody else.\n\nClub captain Stefano Mauri, who turns 36 in July, has hardly been winding down, either. He is one off double figures for league goals this campaign.\n\nKlose hit his seventh goal in nine appearances in the 4-0 defeat of Parma.\n\nHe has been visibly rejuvenated in recent weeks.\n\nThe Klose who used to build his diary around massage sessions and specialist's appointments to deal with back aches and other strains seems to have enjoyed the release of no longer chasing milestones in a Germany jersey.\n\nHis evergreen poaching instincts have also been stimulated by good service into the penalty area.\n\nAntonio Candreva, the Italy international, has been the most reliable supplier and Felipe Anderson, the 22-year-old Brazilian, the most exciting.\n\nAnderson, a close friend of Barcelona's Neymar, used to be suspected of having some dubious lifestyle habits and was criticised for putting on weight when he first came to Italy in the summer of 2013.\n\nHe later explained it was his language difficulties, not his appetite, that were to blame.\n\nHis Italian was so limited that he only knew how to order pasta carbonara, a dish with a creamy sauce, in restaurants. His vocabulary has grown, his form sharpened and Lazio know that to keep him from being lured to a wealthier club they must put Champions League football on his menu next season.\n\nsports@thenational.ae\n\nFollow us on Twitter at our new home at NatSportUAE", "Robson had the Foxes boss as his captain during his time at Middlesbrough and fancies him to beat the drop this season\n\nControversial Nigel Pearson won't change but his methods will keep Leicester in the Premier League.\n\nThat's the view of former \u00adMiddlesbrough manager Bryan Robson who had Pearson as his captain at the club for seven years.\n\nLeicester boss Pearson has had a turbulent season on and off the field as he battles to keep the Foxes from relegation.\n\nHe sent feathers flying this week by calling one reporter an ostrich and has been forced to deny he was a bully or that he needed anger management courses.\n\nRobson also took him to West Brom as his No2 when he was boss there.\n\nPearson and Robson pulled off the Great Escape at West Brom, the first club to be bottom of the Premier League at Christmas and stay up.\n\nWatch this video again Watch Next\n\nSunderland also did it last season, but Gus Poyet didn't have it as tough as Pearson who is set to make history if he pulls off the Great Escape 11.\n\nNo club has been at the bottom of the Premier League as long as Leicester and survived.\n\nThey were bottom for 140 days, just waiting for the funeral to be arranged, and were seven points adrift of safety until Pearson launched the fightback with a home win over West Ham a month ago.\n\nIn their last five games Leicester have beaten everybody except champions-elect Chelsea to climb a point above the bottom three and have Newcastle fearing their trip to the East Midlands today.\n\nBut the pressure seems to be telling on Pearson, 51, and former England captain and Manchester United star Robson says of his pal: \"Nige is a determined character.\n\n\"He knows what he wants. He's not one of these outgoing people. He likes to socialise with his staff, but he will keep himself to himself and with his family and he doesn't give much away.\n\n\"He's very military style in a sense, strong . He knows his own mind. Very disciplined, not with just the players, but within himself too, the way he goes about his work, his lifestyle.\n\n\"Nigel's very clean cut, proper. Always shaving, that type of thing. He expects his players to go about things in that manner. There's no slacking, it's all got to be done right, he's demanding.\"\n\nPearson can be argumentative and awkward . He's had run-ins with Leicester fans, telling one this season to go and die and refusing to apologise.\n\nWhen relegation looked a formality two months ago he was sacked and then reinstated.\n\nRobson, now a Manchester United club ambassador and managing a United legends side taking on Bayern Munich All Stars at Old Trafford in June, knows Pearson inside out.\n\n\"If I left him in charge when we were at West Brom I knew he'd get the job done and the players wouldn't muck about because the manager's not about,\" says Robson\n\n\"As a player, Nigel was unbelievable. He was a tough, hard centre half.\n\n\"His knee was horrendous towards the end at Middlesbrough but he played through the pain, played on one leg. That's what you get from Nigel Pearson.\"\n\nPearson also kept Carlisle in the Football League on the last day of the season and Robson is certain he'll keep Leicester safe as well.\n\n\"Given the fixtures Leicester have left against other teams in trouble I think Nigel will have them safe before the last game,\" says Robson.\n\n\"He wont be going through what me and him went through on the last day with West Brom.\"\n\nRobson had to wait until the final minutes of that season ten years ago to know whether beating Pompey 2-0 was enough. It was, Palace, Norwich and Southampton went down, the Baggies stayed up by a point.\n\n\"You have to convince the players that you are doing the right thing and you can survive,\" adds Robson.\n\n\"When I was at West Brom with Nige we put videos together of the players, showing what they really do well, building confidence. There were motivational speeches, music that players responded too. I'm sure Nigel's doing all that.\n\n\"He is very conscientious with his football, he goes into it all in great depth.\"\n\nRobson went through Leicester's problems with Pearson after a 3-1 defeat at Manchester United when the crisis was at its worst with just two wins from 18 games.\n\n\"Leicester have three home games, Newcastle, Southampton and QPR, and one away, Sunderland,, in their last four. That's a great position to be in. They've put it in their own hands,\" says Robson.\n\n\" If Nige does it , it will be right up there with what we did together because he's been bottom of the league most of the season.\n\n\"He was only promoted last season, he's got a limited budget, so if you are surviving in those circumstances you've done a fantastic job.\"\n\n*Manchester United legends play Bayern Munich All Stars at Old Trafford on June 14.

He was there in March, hiding a big smile behind an even bigger scarf while sitting alongside his parents and his friend Manuel Estiarte as Lionel Messi nutmegged Manchester City's James Milner. He was there as a fan -- he had to abandon his original idea of heading to the game by foot, following the route he trod when he was younger, strolling past the Princesa Sofia hotel -- but there he was, a season ticket holder sitting in his seat at the back of the lower tier in the main stand.\n\nThis time, if he sits at all, he will sit on the bench: the bench, as Bayern Munich manager. For the first time in his life, the ball boy who ran onto the pitch to beg for V\u00edctor Munoz's shirt after Barcelona reached the European Cup final in 1985 and who won the trophy himself seven years later -- the first time the club had ever lifted the trophy -- will want Barcelona to lose. After the Champions League semifinal is over, whatever the result, he will go back to wanting Barcelona to win again. After the Champions League semifinal is over, most in Barcelona will go back to wanting Guardiola to win, all the more so if Bayern reach the final and face Real Madrid.\n\nMost, but not all.\n\nWhen the draw was made, Guardiola said that the first message he got was from his daughter, who was happy that she was going back to see friends. \"Barcelona was our life,\" Guardiola said. \"But in the end it is only a game of football,\" he added. That line didn't convince. It will be much more than that, for good and bad.\n\n\"I hope and expect there to be a great welcome for Guardiola -- he will be handed the honour that he deserves,\" said the Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu.\n\nThat might sound like a redundant statement, a response to a redundant question, but it was not. Whether or not it was a sincere response is another matter. Catalan and captain, Guardiola was the man Johan Cruyff entrusted to direct the \"Dream Team\" in 1980s and 90s and who won the league with Barcelona B and 14 trophies with the first team, including all six in his first year, en route to becoming the most successful coach in the club's history. His nickname was , the myth or legend. And that was when he was a player; by the time he had departed as manager, for some he was almost a deity.\n\nBut he did depart, although he has somehow remained present since. And some won't welcome him back. The immense majority of the fans, probably all of them, will give Guardiola the reception he deserves. But in some sections of the media, the reception will be colder. Downright hostile, in fact. Nasty and unpleasant. Worse, it will not be -- , in fact -- the occasional comment or criticism, but a concerted campaign. And, darker still, the suspicion lingers that behind it lie those who have run the club since Sandro Rosell took over as president in 2010, including some on the current board.\n\nWhen Guardiola left Barcelona in 2013, he was exhausted. The fact that he departed did not please some, leaving them exposed; the way that his departure was handled did not please him. His relationship with Rosell had become distant already. Ideologically they were always different.\n\nBarcelona is a club where politics and self-interest invariably play a part, where there is paranoia and distrust, a club prone to debate and division. Even those who choose not to occupy trenches often find trenches assigned to them. Johan Cruyff vs. Jose Luis Nunez was a civil war that tore Barcelona apart and has not healed; the names change but some of the struggles remain. The media plays the role of propagandists, locked in the confrontation, deepening it; sides are taken, battles fought and provoked. Alliances are always seen, even when they are not real.\n\nGuardiola is Cruyffista, Rosell the president who prompted Cruyff to return to the club offices and angrily hand back his title of honorary president -- a title handed him by the previous president Joan Laporta, who once was Rosell's partner but is now his enemy. Bartomeu was Rosell's vice-president who took over the presidency and now wishes to run again. That long-standing division lurks, always latent even when it does not come to the surface. When elections loom, as they do this summer, all the more so. In the media, points are not just made, they are scored.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that conflicts and resentment going back the best part of two decades are played out on the page. Guardiola long felt, not unjustifiably, that the Godo group (La Vanguardia and El Mundo Deportivo) were mouthpieces for some within the club, champions of the current president and his predecessors, slayers of his opponents, and that the attacks on him were thus attacks on him. Because he appears unaligned with the current board, his status must be undermined for the success to be theirs, it must not be his. On the other side, his status must be reinforced, increased.\n\nAs Pepe Reina, the former Barcelona youth teamer watching on from the outside, put it from Munich this week: \"That's Barcelona's . It has always been like that and it always will be. Everyone is subjected to that, the pressure, the constant comparisons.\" This season there has been something close to a desperation to compare, between those that say this team just isn't like Guardiola's and thus somehow has no value and those on the other side, who have sought to show it was better, even when it was not.\n\nThe debate has been exaggerated at times and unhelpful too, often debilitating. The nostalgia likewise: for current Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, it has been suffocating and unfair. Just as one of Sir Bobby Robson's biggest problems was that he was not Johann Cruyff, so one of Luis Enrique's biggest problems has been that he is not Guardiola. The \"Dream Team\" and the Pep team became swords of Damocles, hanging over the men who followed them.\n\nAnd yet, if that's the background, if that attempt to protect the man who coaches the team now against the ever-present memory of the man who no longer does and who is now coming back to beat them, at times it is still baffling. It is hard to understand and impossible to justify the attitudes towards Guardiola held by some, the viciousness with which they are expressed, hinting at private confrontations and resentments yet to be resolved or revealed.\n\nAt times the cynicism and relentlessness is devastating. In El Mundo Deportivo, any excuse is a good one, no attack too gratuitous. To read Santi Nolla, the paper's editor, is to wonder what exactly it was that Guardiola did to him. How else to explain the bitterness?\n\nIn the summer of 2013, in the course of a press conference in which tellingly he also noted, \"if I want to have dinner with Cruyff, I'll have dinner with Cruyff,\" Guardiola was asked about a comment he had supposedly made in which he had suggested that, Tito Vilanova, his successor as Barcelona manager would not get the best out of Neymar.\n\nThe question prompted a response that revealed the tension that had not always been public, underlining his sense that they could not let go, even after he had gone. That the search for blame had become endless, the desire to seek fault relentless. If his response could be seen as a cause of the way that El Mundo Deportivo has turned on him, it was in fact a consequence of that. And of what he believed to lie beneath.\n\n\"I went 6,000 kilometres away and only asked them to leave me alone but they could not do that,\" Guardiola said. He complained that the club had used Vilanova's illness against him, filtering out the news that he had not visited his former assistant while they were both in New York. Doing so had only one motive: to make Guardiola look bad. \"There are things I will never forget,\" Guardiola said. \"All I ask is that they stop using me, and my friends, to try to hurt me.\"\n\nIn turn, some defended Guardiola -- and were the accused by El Mundo Deportivo of doing his bidding for him. One side's \"news\" was the other side's \"strategic leak\" And so it went on.\n\nLeave me alone, Guardiola had said. They didn't. \"Guardiola does not represent me,\" said El Mundo Deportivo's Cristina Cubero. Maybe that's it. Maybe the fact that he does represent so many Barcelona fans and the way that they cling to him, even after his departures, is the problem, the source of their resentment. His status seems to sting them.\n\nWhen Guardiola returned to watch Barcelona against City, Nolla's editorial was short and poisonous. Although it was coached in phrases like \"Guardiola will always be welcomed here\", it could have come with Batman style KAPOWs and WHACKs and BOOMs on every line. Only it was more sly than that; instead the sound would be the fleshy tear of a knife being slipped into the back of the manager who Barcelona fans are supposed to love.\n\nGuardiola has come to scout an opponent, the article began, something that by the way he didn't do when he was Barcelona coach. SLICE! Lazy Guardiola!\n\nHis football style was spectacular most the time, repetitive and predictable AT others. SLICE! Boring Guardiola!\n\nGuardiola went to Bayern after Jupp Heynckes won it all. SLICE! Lucky Guardiola!\n\nGuardiola was lucky to have the best player in the world: this is \"Messi's Barcelona\". SLICE! It was never about the coach here anyway!\n\nAnd on it goes. Nolla added there is only one Barcelona coach and that's Luis Enrique.\n\nOn Wednesday night, there will be only one: Luis Enrique. But standing by the other bench there will be a former Barcelona coach. Pep Guardiola, the man the supporters will welcome back even as some in the boardroom and others in the pressroom grit their teeth. Luis Enrique's task this season has been harder because of the presence of the myth but he, unlike they, has no doubts. \"Pep is my friend and I always think my friends are the best,\" the Barcelona manager said.", "Barcelona coach Luis Enrique says his team are ready for the decisive stage of the season as they head into Saturday's La Liga game at bottom side Cordoba.\n\nWith just four games left to play, Barcelona sit top of the Primera Division table, two points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid.\n\nMany Barca fans and pundits are expecting three relatively easy points against a Cordoba team who have not won for 16 games, and were beaten 5-0 in December's reverse fixture.\n\nThe Blaugrana have also got one eye on Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against Bayern Munich, with former Barca player and coach Pep Guardiola set for an emotional Camp Nou return in charge of the Bundesliga champions.\n\nAsked if his team could be distracted by the looming clash with Guardiola's Bayern, Luis Enrique coach told his pregame news conference that he and his players would not endanger the hard work put in to get this close to the Spanish title by slipping up now.\n\n\"The league championship is in play,\" Luis Enrique said. \"The players know that, I can see it in the training sessions. It takes many months to achieve this.\n\n\"We have been an intense team all season. Until you reach the finishing line you cannot see if it has been a success or not.\n\n\"It is like a marathon runner who has a great time at kilometre 40, and stops and starts to walk. This is the decisive stage for almost all the teams, and they all have their goals within reach.\"\n\nTuesday's 6-0 hammering of Getafe at the Camp Nou has led even the most sceptical pundits to praise Luis Enrique's team, though he said it was late for anyone to realise how well the team had been playing all season.\n\n\"I do not have the sense that the team is coming good now,\" he said. \"Over the season we have had situations favourable and less favourable, but we have kept to a logical process.\n\n\"If people had to wait for a 6-0 to have confidence in the team, well really... The team have shown from the start of the season that they are a sound team. I am optimistic, of course.\"\n\nSome rotation is likely for the Cordoba game given Wednesday's looming European challenge. Luis Enrique has a full squad to choose from, with left-back Jordi Alba back from suspension, and no new injury concerns.\n\nSuperstar front three Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Messi -- who have already scored 102 goals between this season -- nevertheless look likely to keep their places in attack, a situation which Luis Enrique admitted was not so easy for back-up players such as winger Pedro Rodriguez to accept.\n\n\"Reaching this moment I understand all the personal situations, but we must focus on the team and on reaching our goals,\" he said. \"At the end of the season we will look at the situation of each individual. Pedro is a top player, and has always helped us, on and off the pitch.\"\n\nCordoba have not scored in any of their last four outings and could be mathematically assured of relegation by Saturday evening, but Luis Enrique said his players would approach this game the same as any other.\n\n\"They are in a difficult situation,\" he added. \"We go into the game the same as always, not thinking about the opponent's place in the table.\n\n\"The obligations on everyone are huge, as there are just four games remaining.

It now sits comfortably in eighth position but a whopping 37 points behind leader Bayern Munich.\n\nOnce the news of Klopp's departure had sunk in, the focus quickly moved to potential successors.\n\nWho could possibly come in to fill the incredibly large boots left by the hugely popular manager? Surely there had to be big name, experienced candidates on the shortlist.\n\nWe didn't have to wait long for the answer though. Within days it was announced that Thomas Tuchel would be the one to take over.\n\nSo the question is, who is Tomas Tuchel and why was he chosen?\n\nFunnily enough Tuchel and I both played at the same club under ex-Schalke, Stuttgart and Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick.\n\nTuchel played as a defender for SSV Ulm 1846, joining the club in 1994. He made 69 appearances for the Swabian side in four years, before ending his career at 25 due to injury in 1998.\n\nI joined Ulm the next season as Tuchel left to begin life after football, with his first coaching appointment coming only two years later in 2000, as head coach of VfB Stuttgart's Under-19 side - which included a certain Sami Khedira.\n\nAfter five year in the role he returned to Augsburg as youth team co-ordinator before taking up a similar role at 1. FSV Mainz 05.\n\nAfter winning the Under-19 Bundesliga title in 2009, the club surprised many by naming Tuchel coach of newly promoted Mainz for the 2009-2010 Bundesliga season.\n\nIn his first season in charge, Tuchel led Mainz to a ninth place finish but it was the following year when he hit the big time.\n\nTuchel guided the club to its best ever Bundesliga finish of fifth and equalled the best ever start to a season by any club after securing seven wins in the first seven games - including an away victory over Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 2010-2011 campaign also saw the emergence of Andre Schurrle at Mainz - with 15 goals in 33 games leading to a big money transfer to Bayern Leverkusen.\n\nSo despite being relatively inexperienced, Tuchel has already earned quite a reputation and been approached by the likes of Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nIt's not the first time he's followed in Klopp's footsteps either.\n\nTuchel got his first start at senior level at Mainz, just as Klopp did.\n\nWhile obviously disappointed that its guru-like master will be leaving, Dortmund fans can expect an exciting new era. Tuchel is known as a meticulous tactician who regularly changes formation based on the opposition.\n\nHe has spent the last year on sabbatical, learning and studying the game as well as other sports to increase his knowledge and tactical awareness.\n\nTuchel also experiments with unique training practices. Pitch dimensions are often cut to resemble a diamond - to prevent long passes down the sidelines - as well as forcing players to adapt to different shapes on varying pitch sizes.\n\nHe likes to promote youth, which can be seen in his recruitment - another key feature in Klopp's teams.\n\nBut it's Tuchel's ambition and thirst for knowledge that really stands out.\n\n\"I learned everything about the game - especially during Guardiola's time at Barcelona,\" he said.\n\nIf that's the case, and given his reputation in Germany, we can expect some epic battles between the two Bayern and Dortmund again in the coming season and perhaps a new era of success for the mighty Die Schwarzgelben.", "MUNICH -- Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola says he will not know until shortly before the match whether striker Robert Lewandowski will play on Wednesday in Barcelona in the Champions League semifinals.\n\nGuardiola says \"we will see his condition on Monday, Tuesday,\" adding that \"the doctor is the chief.\"\n\nLewandowski suffered a concussion and facial fractures in the German Cup semifinal loss on Tuesday when was slammed by Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Mitch Langerak.\n\nBayern has lost winger Arjen Robben for the season with a calf injury.

Gundogan did extend his contract one year ago when he was seriously injured, but only for 365 more days.\n\nThat made it quite clear what he was up to.\n\nDortmund presented him with a possible contract-extension months ago, but Gundogan never really thought about signing it.\n\nSo they felt he was leaving. That's why they already lined up possible replacements in Leverkusen's Gonzalo Castro and Mainz' Johannes Geiss.\n\nAs far as Gundogan's future is concerned, it has seemed quite certain that he would be going to the Premier league for a long time.\n\nBut in the last few days more and more rumours about Bayern have emerged.

He's very strict on discipline.\n\n'Ancelotti is more like [Sir Alex] Ferguson, he's more liberal. Ancelotti has a bit more contact with us and he is more relaxed.'\n\nReal Madrid's on-loan star went on to downplay alleged claims made by Van Gaal that Hernandez would not be returning to Old Trafford despite his recent success in front of goal.\n\nHe added: 'If he did say that, then that is his opinion and you have to respect that.\n\n'If not everyone in the world adores Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi, imagine what it's like for those of us who are several steps further down the scale.'\n\nElsehwere in the Spanish media, Sport suggest Barcelona are keen on raiding Manchester for four of the Barclays Premier League's top players.\n\nManchester United trio Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera are all said to be on Barcelona's summer wishlist, while Manchester City playmaker David Silva is also high on their agenda.\n\nMundo Deportivo look ahead to Barcelona's upcoming Champions League semi-final first leg, which sees former boss Pep Guardiola return to the Nou Camp with his Bayern Munich side.\n\nOver in Italy, Tuttosport have spoken to Fabio Capello about Juventus' chances of reaching the Champions League final.\n\nThe former England coach believes Juventus can eliminate Real Madrid if Andrea Pirlo is on form.\n\n'It's a great lie that the Champions League draw was favourable, Ancelotti's defence is better than Bayern or Barcelona, but with Andrea you can dream,' explained Capello.\n\n'It will be vital to take advantage of the first leg at the Juventus Stadium.'", "Liverpool and Paris St Germain remain ahead of Manchester United in the race for Memphis Depay.\n\nPSV sporting director Marcel Brands acknowledged last month that three clubs had made an approach for the Eredivisie top goalscorer who is available for \u00a320million.\n\nBrands said: 'PSG and Liverpool are indeed a step ahead of Manchester United in the race to sign Memphis.

someone without discussing it with the physio and doctors first,' Guardiola told the assembled media at a press conference.\n\n'Arjen is an incredibly important player for us and he was

the title? Who will qualify for Europe? Who will suffer the ignominy of relegation?\n\nWe take a look at the state of play in the major leagues on the continent ahead of a pivotal weekend to answer these questions.\n\nSPAIN - LA LIGA\n\nChampions - With four rounds to play, a thrilling title race is brewing in La Liga between eternal rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nIt's 'as you were' following the midweek round of matches, with Barcelona preserving their two-point lead with a 6-0 rout of Getafe. Real Madrid beat Almeria 3-0 to keep in touch.\n\nIf the two teams were to finish level on points, Real would take the crown by virtue of one goal. In the Spanish league, teams are split on their head-to-head record, so Real's 3-1 win over Barca in October would be better than Barca's 2-1 win in March.\n\nAn important weekend awaits, with Barca travelling to Cordoba on Saturday afternoon and Real playing at fifth-place Sevilla a few hours later. But you sense the title will hinge on Barca getting something at Atletico Madrid on May 17.\n\nChampions League - Like the Premier League, Spain gets four places in Europe's elite competition. Barcelona and Real Madrid have already qualified, and Atletico Madrid are almost over the line.\n\nThat means a tug-of-war between Valencia and Sevilla, both locked on 69 points, for the fourth spot, which means they enter in the play-off round.\n\nIf it remained the same, Valencia would qualify by virtue of taking four points off Sevilla in matches this season.\n\nEuropa League - The loser out of Valencia and Sevilla will take fifth spot, while Villarreal have a six-point cushion over Malaga for the other Europa League berth.\n\nRelegation - Cordoba look doomed as they are 11 points from safety, while Granada need a miracle to survive. Deportivo La Coruna currently occupy the final relegation place and are two points behind Eibar and Almeria, so the situation could easily change.\n\nTop scorer - Once again, it's a thrilling race between Cristiano Ronaldo (39 league goals) and Lionel Messi (38).\n\nITALY - SERIE A\n\nChampions - It would take a collapse of seismic proportions for Juventus not to win their fourth consecutive Scudetto. 14 points clear with five games to play, they need just one point from their trip to Sampdoria on Saturday to make absolutely sure.\n\nChampions League - Italy have just three places in the Champions League and Juventus have one sewn up. It looks likely that Lazio and Roma will follow them, with a five-point gap between the latter and Napoli in fourth.\n\nEuropa League - At the moment, Napoli and Sampdoria occupy the two places but Rafael Benitez's men could yet make the Champions League if they win the Europa League on May 27.\n\nOtherwise, with a six-point cushion, they will likely have another season in Europe's secondary competition to fall back on.\n\nSampdoria have Genoa, Fiorentina, Torino and Inter Milan snapping at their heels in the closing weeks of the season.\n\nRelegation - Crisis club Parma are already down and it looks as though Cesena and Cagliari will follow them into Serie B. They are both cut adrift by eight points.\n\nTop scorer - Juve star Carlos Tevez has 20 for the season in the league, while Mauro Icardi of Inter and Luca Toni of Verona have 18 apiece.\n\nGERMANY - BUNDESLIGA\n\nChampions - Bayern Munich won their third successive title last weekend after they beat Hertha Berlin 1-0 and second-placed Wolfsburg lost at Borussia Monchengladbach. They have been dominant all year and currently enjoy a 15-point lead.\n\nChampions League - Recent successes in the competition means that the Bundesliga gets four Champions League places and the teams have already been decided with four rounds left.\n\nBayern, Wolfsburg, Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen will be flying the flag for Germany next season. It is yet to be determined which of the last three will have to negotiate the play-offs.\n\nEuropa League - Schalke and Augsburg currently occupy the two places but it'll be a tight race, with Hoffenheim, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Mainz all breathing down their necks.\n\nRelegation - This is set to go right down to the wire. Ahead of this weekend, Stuttgart are rock bottom and two points from safety, with Paderborn a point and a place above them.\n\nHamburg are currently in the spot that leading to a play-off with the third-placed team in the second division, the same route they needed to avoid the drop last season.\n\nHowever, it is possible that Hannover and Freiburg will also be sucked in to the dogfight.\n\nTop scorer - Alexander Meier of Eintracht Frankfurt has 19 league goals, two more than Arjen Robben and three more than Robert Lewandowski. Both Bayern men currently have their injury troubles.\n\nFRANCE - LIGUE 1\n\nChampions - Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain have come into form at just the right moment and have accelerated through the pack to assume a three-point lead with four matches left to play.\n\nIt now seems that Lyon are the only team that can stop Laurent Blanc's team, with Monaco unable to sustain the pace.\n\nChampions League - PSG and Lyon are likely to take two of France's three available places, meaning a fight between Monaco, Saint-Etienne, Marseille and Bordeaux for the other place. Monaco, in third, are currently two ahead of Saint-Etienne.\n\nEuropa League - There are two places up for grabs through finishing fourth and fifth in the league table. Saint-Etienne and Marseille are there at the moment but Bordeaux and Montpellier could steal in should they slip up.\n\nRelegation - Lens are already doomed to the second tier, with Metz, eight points from safety, likely to join them.

He told me that he had a commitment with Ferguson and with the United supporters to stay one more year but that he had agreed with the club to move the following summer. And so it happened.

Skripnik has transformed Werder's season, and they are still in the hunt for a Europa League spot.\n\nThe key to Werder's revival under Skripnik has been the club's improvement at home. They have won seven of their 11 home games since Skripnik took charge, racking up five clean sheets in the process.\n\nFrankfurt have nosedived since losing top scorer and talisman Alex Meier to injury, and they have lost six of their last seven away games. To make matters worse, gritty and intelligent midfielder Stefan Aigner is also out with a thigh problem. Defender Alex Madlung is suspended, and his potential replacement Marco Russ isn't fully fit.\n\nBremen have injury worries too, but most of their key players are fit, and at [2.16] they look overpriced to win this regardless of the Schaaf factor.\n\nWith the title wrapped up and the Champions League qualification places dished out, the relegation battle is now by far the most interesting aspect of the season. Realistically, five clubs are battling to survive, and two of them meet in the Black Forest.\n\nFreiburg did really well to fight back from 2-0 down at Stuttgart last weekend thanks to a second-half brace from on-loan Werder striker Nils Petersen. The former Bayern Munich forward really struggled at the Weserstadion in the first half of the campaign, but since his move he has scored six goals in just eight appearances.\n\nIf Freiburg are to escape the drop yet again under the combative and inspirational leadership of coach Christian Streich, it will be their home form that gets them out of jail. Freiburg have won two of their last three home games, and 18 of their 30 points this term have been collected in the Black Forest. Three of their four home victories this term have come since Christmas.\n\nPaderborn are gamely battling the drop, despite having the lowest budget in the league and arguably the least experienced squad. They blew a 2-0 lead at home to Werder last week, drawing 2-2. That means Andre Breitenreiter's men have won just twice since Christmas, and away from home they have lost their last four matches.\n\nFreiburg's fans generate a great atmosphere for big games, and with Petersen in lethal form, I think the hosts can make their extra quality tell against a hard-working but limited Paderborn side.\n\nWolfsburg's brave bid to win the Bundesliga finally came to an end last weekend with defeat at Borussia Monchengladbach, but Dieter Hecking's men bounced back superbly in midweek by reaching the German Cup final. The Wolves demolished third-tier Arminia Bielefeld 4-0 to book a fascinating Berlin showdown with Borussia Dortmund. Winning only the second major trophy in Wolfsburg's history would be a fitting reward for the players' efforts this term.\n\nWolfsburg's Lower Saxony rivals Hannover are having a nightmarish end to the campaign. After winning six of their first 11 league games, Hannover had to bat away questions about an unlikely push for the top four. That talk proved to be fanciful in the extreme, and the 96ers have lost seven of their last 11 games to slip into the relegation maelstrom.\n\nStruggling and inexperienced coach Tayfun Korkut was kept on for far too long, and when he was finally jettisoned, he was replaced by Michael Frontzeck in a move that defied belief or explanation. Frontzeck failed at Gladbach and St Pauli, and had been out of the dugout for 18 months when Hannover came calling.\n\nFrontzeck's first game in charge was last week's 2-1 home defeat to Hoffenheim, and I don't think this derby will yield better results. Hannover have lost four of their last six away matches, and they haven't won on the road since November.\n\nWolfsburg have no fresh injury concerns, and haven't yet secured second place, so they don't lack motivation. They have won six of their last seven home games in the league, and they drubbed Hannover 3-1 in the reverse fixture.\n\nKevin will be commentating on Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich for TuneIn Radio and talkSPORT.

Who will qualify for Europe? Who will suffer the ignominy of relegation?\n\nWe take a look at the state of play in the major leagues on the continent ahead of a pivotal weekend to answer these questions.\n\nSPAIN - LA LIGA\n\nChampions - With four rounds to play, a thrilling title race is brewing in La Liga between eternal rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nIt's 'as you were' following the midweek round of matches, with Barcelona preserving their two-point lead with a 6-0 rout of Getafe. Real Madrid beat Almeria 3-0 to keep in touch.\n\nIf the two teams were to finish level on points, Real would take the crown by virtue of one goal. In the Spanish league, teams are split on their head-to-head record, so Real's 3-1 win over Barca in October would be better than Barca's 2-1 win in March.\n\nAn important weekend awaits, with Barca travelling to Cordoba on Saturday afternoon and Real playing at fifth-place Sevilla a few hours later. But you sense the title will hinge on Barca getting something at Atletico Madrid on May 17.\n\nChampions League - Like the Premier League, Spain gets four places in Europe's elite competition. Barcelona and Real Madrid have already qualified, and Atletico Madrid are almost over the line.\n\nThat means a tug-of-war between Valencia and Sevilla, both locked on 69 points, for the fourth spot, which means they enter in the play-off round.\n\nIf it remained the same, Valencia would qualify by virtue of taking four points off Sevilla in matches this season.\n\nEuropa League - The loser out of Valencia and Sevilla will take fifth spot, while Villarreal have a six-point cushion over Malaga for the other Europa League berth.\n\nRelegation - Cordoba look doomed as they are 11 points from safety, while Granada need a miracle to survive. Deportivo La Coruna currently occupy the final relegation place and are two points behind Eibar and Almeria, so the situation could easily change.\n\nTop scorer - Once again, it's a thrilling race between Cristiano Ronaldo (39 league goals) and Lionel Messi (38).\n\nITALY - SERIE A\n\nChampions - It would take a collapse of seismic proportions for Juventus not to win their fourth consecutive Scudetto. 14 points clear with five games to play, they need just one point from their trip to Sampdoria on Saturday to make absolutely sure.\n\nChampions League - Italy have just three places in the Champions League and Juventus have one sewn up. It looks likely that Lazio and Roma will follow them, with a five-point gap between the latter and Napoli in fourth.\n\nEuropa League - At the moment, Napoli and Sampdoria occupy the two places but Rafael Benitez's men could yet make the Champions League if they win the Europa League on May 27.\n\nOtherwise, with a six-point cushion, they will likely have another season in Europe's secondary competition to fall back on.\n\nSampdoria have Genoa, Fiorentina, Torino and Inter Milan snapping at their heels in the closing weeks of the season.\n\nRelegation - Crisis club Parma are already down and it looks as though Cesena and Cagliari will follow them into Serie B. They are both cut adrift by eight points.\n\nTop scorer - Juve star Carlos Tevez has 20 for the season in the league, while Mauro Icardi of Inter and Luca Toni of Verona have 18 apiece.\n\nGERMANY - BUNDESLIGA\n\nChampions - Bayern Munich won their third successive title last weekend after they beat Hertha Berlin 1-0 and second-placed Wolfsburg lost at Borussia Monchengladbach. They have been dominant all year and currently enjoy a 15-point lead.\n\nChampions League - Recent successes in the competition means that the Bundesliga gets four Champions League places and the teams have already been decided with four rounds left.\n\nBayern, Wolfsburg, Monchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen will be flying the flag for Germany next season. It is yet to be determined which of the last three will have to negotiate the play-offs.\n\nEuropa League - Schalke and Augsburg currently occupy the two places but it'll be a tight race, with Hoffenheim, Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and Mainz all breathing down their necks.\n\nRelegation - This is set to go right down to the wire. Ahead of this weekend, Stuttgart are rock bottom and two points from safety, with Paderborn a point and a place above them.\n\nHamburg are currently in the spot that leading to a play-off with the third-placed team in the second division, the same route they needed to avoid the drop last season.\n\nHowever, it is possible that Hannover and Freiburg will also be sucked in to the dogfight.\n\nTop scorer - Alexander Meier of Eintracht Frankfurt has 19 league goals, two more than Arjen Robben and three more than Robert Lewandowski. Both Bayern men currently have their injury troubles.\n\nFRANCE - LIGUE 1\n\nChampions - Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain have come into form at just the right moment and have accelerated through the pack to assume a three-point lead with four matches left to play.\n\nIt now seems that Lyon are the only team that can stop Laurent Blanc's team, with Monaco unable to sustain the pace.\n\nChampions League - PSG and Lyon are likely to take two of France's three available places, meaning a fight between Monaco, Saint-Etienne, Marseille and Bordeaux for the other place. Monaco, in third, are currently two ahead of Saint-Etienne.\n\nEuropa League - There are two places up for grabs through finishing fourth and fifth in the league table. Saint-Etienne and Marseille are there at the moment but Bordeaux and Montpellier could steal in should they slip up.\n\nRelegation - Lens are already doomed to the second tier, with Metz, eight points from safety, likely to join them.

Their products are used by engineers to execute increasingly complex electronic designs as technology becomes increasingly embedded in everything we touch. Clients include the major players in the semiconductor industry, as well as companies involved in transportation (BMW, Hyundai, Honda, Boeing, Airbus, Honeywell, GE, Johnson Controls). Investment Thesis: Like most software, there is a stickiness to Mentor's products given these are highly complex software tools. Once engineers spend the time to learn and become proficient in the software, there is a strong preference to continue using it over switching to another product. There is also a secular growth story to electronics becoming increasingly embedded in transportation, including automotive, aerospace, trucking, farming and construction.

The voice at the end of the line was smooth and charming. Would he like to invest his savings in an ethical cause? If so, here was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nStanley, a 94-year-old retired chartered accountant from London and a family member of the Fifties British company, Adelphi Films, had always had a good nose for business.\n\nBut by the time he received that phone call in November 2011, the former World War II gunner, who'd fought in Egypt and Syria as a Desert Rat, had suffered a major stroke. His thoughts were more muddled. Speech was difficult. For the fraudster at the other end of the phone, Stanley's vulnerability, not to mention his interest in green causes, made him a perfect target.\n\nIt didn't take long to convince the pensioner to invest \u00a38,000 in a worthless 'carbon credits' scheme. A 'carbon credit' is a certificate that allows a company to emit a tonne of carbon dioxide. But despite promises of huge returns, the credits have virtually no re-sale value. The Financial Conduct Authority advises against investing in them and warns that most such schemes are scams.\n\nMr Dent was one of hundreds of pensioners targeted in a \u00a310 million sting operated from offices in central London. Other elderly investors were also persuaded to part with cash after being offered shares in worthless tracts of land.\n\nSome invested in what they were told was land earmarked for development as a way of putting something aside for their grandchildren. Others hoped to earn an income for their twilight years. Last year, the criminal masterminds behind the fraud were jailed after a painstaking operation by fraud squad officers.\n\nBut only now have officers opened their files and revealed just how callous and remorseless the tricksters were and how they wormed their way into the confidence of so many elderly and vulnerable people.\n\nExclusive mobile phone footage seen by the Mail, which will be shown on ITV's Fraud Squad tonight, shows the greedy perpetrators of this cruel crime gloating about their success.\n\n'Welcome to the fraud show!' shouts one, punching the air at the end of another successful deal. His vile behaviour is met by raucous laughter from others cold-calling pensioners from the central London office.\n\nIn another sickening piece of footage, one of the fraudsters is seen at home with his girlfriend, clutching wads of \u00a350 notes, drunkenly singing along to the Jessie J song, Price Tag.\n\nThe couple in the footage are Clive Griston, 53, and Kerry Golesworthy, 49, both jailed last year for fraud and money laundering -- but not before they spent millions on designer clothes, flashy cars and lavish fittings for their new home.\n\nAlso jailed was Griston's sidekick, 31-year-old Matthew Noad and his 61-year-old father Roger Noad, who spent 30 years working for the Queen's bank, Coutts, and was found guilty of laundering \u00a3650,000 of the proceeds of his son's fraud through his own bank account.\n\nHis wife Linda, 59, was also found guilty of money laundering.\n\nBut while the criminals were revelling in their crime, frail Stanley Dent suffered another stroke, one which left him in a wheelchair, unable to speak or comprehend much of what was being said to him.\n\nAfter being admitted into a North London nursing home, his worthless carbon credits were judged as investments during assessments to see if his care should be council-funded and so his family were forced to pay his bills.\n\n'It was an incredibly stressful time,' says Stanley's daughter, Kate Lees, 65. 'It wasn't just that we had to cope with my father's illness, but also with the fact that he had been tricked in such a cruel way at a time when he wasn't able to defend himself.\n\n'This is a man who volunteered to fight in World War II and marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday each year.\n\n'I don't have the words to say how diabolical that is. They knew how vulnerable he was.'\n\nIt was back in 2005 that Matthew Noad and Clive Griston, both from Kent, put their criminal brains together and came up with a scam that would net them \u00a310 million.\n\nTogether, they set up a London-based 'boiler room' where they employed high-pressure salesmen to sell off tracts of land in Dumbarton in Scotland, Towcester in Northamptonshire and Cullompton in Devon.\n\nThose on the receiving end of cold calls were told they would make returns of several hundred per cent on sites ripe for development. In reality, the land was either situated in greenfield belts, flood zones or areas of historical or environmental significance with no prospect of planning permission.\n\nFor most of the victims, the calls began gently. Noad and Griston set themselves up as limited companies and rented prestigious offices to create a veneer of legitimacy.\n\nThose they called were sent glossy brochures and then pressured further with follow-up calls. Their victims were all elderly pensioners with savings to invest, such as Judith Wilkins, a retired psychiatric nurse from Gloucestershire.\n\nNow 76, the mother of six had recently been widowed and was helping to care for her terminally ill brother when, in late 2008, she took a call that would see her lose \u00a310,000 of her life savings.\n\n'The man was charming, but persistent, telling me he had a wonderful investment opportunity,' she recalls. 'They were very keen to find out more about my background and my details. He tried to get under my skin.'\n\nNext came the literature -- a mound of glossy brochures. 'It all looked so legitimate,' says Judith. 'They had gone to such great lengths to draw up a contract. It was impressive.\n\nSo impressive that Judith sent them a cheque for \u00a32,000 -- the sum requested as an 'initial investment'.\n\nThe calls continued, emphasising that the more Judith invested, the better the return.\n\nWithin a month she had written another cheque, this time for \u00a38,000. 'But they still asked for more,' says Judith. They wanted another \u00a318,000, to be precise -- and this time alarm bells started to ring.\n\n'I talked about it with my eldest son, John, and he told me it was a scam,' she says. 'To start with, I didn't believe it, but the more I thought about it the more it made sense. I felt so stupid and embarrassed.'\n\nMeanwhile, the fraudsters upped the ante. 'They carried on ringing, saying I had promised them money. It was relentless, and it got rather threatening -- they were saying I owed them the money whether I liked it or not,' she says.\n\n'I told them I couldn't afford it as I would lose my house, but they wouldn't take no for an answer. I remember crying down the phone but it cut no ice. They simply didn't care.'\n\nFortunately, Judith had the presence of mind to talk to someone at her bank and, following their intervention, the calls stopped. 'I knew then that my son was right,' she says quietly. 'Until that point, a part of me wouldn't believe it because I couldn't believe people could be so nasty. But they were world-class scammers.'\n\nJudith was interviewed by the police, although by then she knew she was unlikely to see her \u00a310,000 again. 'I felt utterly deflated when it had sunk in,' she says. 'I found it hard to talk to my family about it. I still do, in some ways.\n\n'I like to think I am an intelligent woman. I worked very hard all my life and to think someone thought they had a right to take that money -- it's disgusting.'\n\nYet she at least had other savings to fall back on. Some victims lost even greater sums. One was a survivor of the Thalidomide drug, who invested his compensation settlement worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Another was an 89-year-old blind man from Cardiff, who paid \u00a394,000 for worthless plots of land in Dumbarton after being told it was earmarked for development.\n\nAnd an 87-year-old retired teacher invested \u00a387,000 with Noad and Griston's company Capital Carbon Credits, after being continually pressured into handing over more and more of her savings.\n\nAccording to Detective Inspector Ben Flannaghan, who helped co-ordinate the City of London police fraud investigation: 'You may be ill, you may have dementia. That's not going to stop them. In many ways, they'll see that as a way in. If someone's more vulnerable, they're an easier way to get money.'\n\nFormer university lecturer John Phythian, 81, invested more than \u00a350,000 in ten plots of land in Northamptonshire and Devon believing he would make money for his grandchildren when it was sold to developers for house building.\n\n'I'd ask them: 'Well, have you got planning permission?' And they'd say: 'We're expecting that. We're working on that,' ' he says.\n\nIn fact, the land in Towcester was part of a 'scheduled monument' site with protected status and would never have been granted planning permission for new homes.\n\nMeanwhile, the land in Cullompton, Devon, was on a flood plain, again making it useless. While Mr Phythian paid \u00a35,000 for his 90 sq m, the land was actually worth around only \u00a3100.\n\nIt was in 2010 that City of London Police Economic Crime Directorate, which leads fraud investigations in the UK, began seeing a huge number of reports to the Action Fraud hotline by callers concerned about land investments they had made in three firms -- Browne Mackenzie, Lawrence Taylor and Charles Barkley.\n\nThe companies belonged to Clive Griston and Matthew Noad, who were arrested in December 2010 on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering.\n\nAstonishingly, it was while the pair were on bail for the land scam that they set up Carbon Capital Credits, making themselves another million -- and spending it -- before police caught up with them again. Company bank accounts revealed how millions were going to Griston and Matthew Noad and substantial sums to Griston's girlfriend, Kerry Golesworthy, who had no role in the company and no legitimate reason to have the money.\n\nRaids on their homes revealed how extravagant the pair, and their families, were. While Griston and Golesworthy were renovating their \u00a32.5 million house in Orpington, Kent, they were renting a penthouse suite in a luxury, gated development in the county when police arrested them. Their Bentley, Range Rover and BMW were parked in a secure basement below the property.\n\nInside, cupboards were overflowing with designer clothing and shopping bags from Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nGriston's own wardrobe contained 30 designer shirts, not to mention bottles of vintage champagne and a \u00a3150 bottle of Chateau d'Yquem.\n\nMeanwhile, in Sevenoaks, Matthew Noad's father and mother, Roger and Linda, were living in a \u00a31.2 million house. They enjoyed a luxury holiday to Dubai with their son, who also bought himself \u00a318,000 worth of jewellery and a new Mercedes.\n\nAt the nearby penthouse home of Matthew Noad in Keston, Kent, police found a lavishly decorated interior complete with a pool room, a bar and a kitchen with cabinets worth thousands.\n\nDet Chief Insp David Carter, who witnessed the group's greed first hand, says: 'In order to live a lifestyle like this they have to ruin the lives of innocent members of society. If the victims could see what their monies were actually paying for they would be absolutely pig sick.'\n\nIndeed, for family and friends of those conned, knowing that their loved ones' hard-earned savings were squandered is heartbreaking.\n\nKate Lees, who now manages the company set up by her grandfather, Arthur Dent, which produced over 40 British films featuring stars such as Peter Sellers and Diana Dors, says her only comfort is that her father, who died aged 95 a year after he was conned, never understood that he had been tricked.\n\n'As his power of attorney, I had to go through all his papers,' she says. 'At first I thought it was simply a foolish investment. It was only after I read an article about carbon credits being worthless that I realised it was a scam and contacted the police.'\n\nShe went to the Old Bailey to watch Griston and Noad being jailed for four years and eight months each in April last year.\n\nKerry Golesworthy was jailed for three-and-a-half years. Roger Noad was jailed for three years for laundering \u00a3655,000 through his bank accounts. His wife Linda, who left her job at Sainsbury's in shame after her arrest, received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n'They're vile, vile people. Their sentences weren't long enough for what they did to people like my father,' says Kate.\n\nIt's hard not to agree or to see the vast gulf that divides the likes of Griston and Noad from a man like Stanley Dent, who volunteered to fight fascism before returning to Britain and what he hoped was a better world.", "The original BMW X6 challenged SUV orthodoxy back in 2008, and was crucified by critics as a result: Too heavy, too profligate, too impractical, said the industry ayatollahs -- the same crowd that routinely fellates every portly $200,000 Bentley that comes down the pike.\n\nSure, by slicing and sloping the roof of the X5 on which it's based, the X6 announced that style and performance were its primary mission, not ferrying brats to bassoon lessons. And that -- the insistence that an SUV had as much right as any other car to ditch responsibility and just be fun -- was the BMW's unspoken crime, if critics had been honest with themselves.\n\nTellingly, the man on the street -- and the woman, too -- had no such issues. He got the X6 the second he laid eyes on it: It's totally bad-ass, an artillery shell on wheels, strikingly proportioned, decisively masculine. And it's still more practical than a sport sedan, with a touch of AWD ground clearance, fold-down rear seats and a decent cargo hold. The X6 proved an instant hit, with 200,000 sales and counting. Like other controversial BMW innovations, the X6 spawned imitators, including the comparatively awkward soon-to-be-released Mercedes GLE-Class.\n\nFor 2010, the X6M (and X5M) gained performance to match the superhero styling, and again managed to piss off traditionalists: Its twin-turbo V8 marked the first use of turbocharging by BMW's storied M division, now adopted by the M3, M5 and M6, and also became first with AWD.\n\nThat brings us to today, at Monticello Motor Club. At this devilish road course near the Catskills, we're rocketing the redesigned X6M down the long straightaway to the tune of 150 mph, lap after lap. It's a ridiculous speed in a 5,000-pound SUV that would seem to have no business on a road course. Yet it does, in the hell-with-physics fashion that's only gotten better in this second generation: Upped to 567 horsepower, the new 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 catapults the BMW to 60 mph in a shocking four seconds flat, with a smooth eight-speed, paddle-shifted conventional automatic divvying gears better than the previous six speed. Torque jumps 10 percent to 553 pound-feet and peaks at just 2,200 rpm, the better to blow away unsuspecting two-seaters at stoplights.\n\nThe BMW X6M is totally bad-ass, an artillery shell on wheels.\n\nThe body stays flatter than a Marine recruit's buzz cut, with less push from the front end. The ingenious torque-vectoring rear axle overdrives the outside rear wheel to help this beast scrabble out of turns in a way drivers can really feel. The rear-biased xDrive AWD system can send 100 percent of torque to either front or rear wheels. Launch control will both dazzle and discombobulate your bros. The stability system's M Dynamic Mode even lets the X6M execute some stylish drifts, like a hippo on skates, before it reels everything back in.\n\nUpping the previous 20-inch wheels to truly gigantic 21-inchers, with sticky Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, makes room for brakes with 50 percent more surface area. Throw in six-piston calipers up front, and the BMW has the braking power that's especially critical in this large-scale machine in which pilots could otherwise get in over their heads. The brakes start feeling a bit spongy after five brutal laps, yet a quick cool-down has them ready to rock again.\n\nNew electric steering doesn't transmit much of the road surface, but it's better weighted than the previous, overly leaden hydraulic unit. The interior is sweet, too, with body-cuddling sport seats, a thick-rimmed M steering wheel and an optional full-leather wrap in soft Merino hides. Even BMW's stubby, smooth-headed console shift knob -- it recalls a high-end sex toy from Berlin -- seems to work more pleasurably than before. To shift gears, that is.\n\nThe X6M starts from $103,050, but with infrared Night Vision and a few other goodies, reached $115,150. That's a lot of dough for this Bavarian creampuff. But it's about $53,000 less than the base price of the 570-hp Porsche Cayenne Turbo S, the only SUV right now that can challenge the Bimmer's performance.\n\nThe only tears flow at the pump: The X6M drank a gallon of premium unleaded every 12 miles, though a lighter touch might get you closer to 16.\n\nLike the Porsche, the BMW is still no sports car, despite prodigious power and roadholding grip. Instead, it's a freak athlete, a linebacker with a blazing 40-yard time that's out to knock everyone's dick in the dirt. Yet the sheer improbability of the X6M's performance makes it a hoot to drive: 2.5 tons of big-bootied fun, in a BMW that knows how to shake it.", "Diesel cars could be phased out in Britain after the Supreme Court ruled that the Government must take urgent steps to tackle air pollution in cities.\n\nThe UK is facing millions of pounds of fines from the European Commission for failing to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\n\nYesterday judges in Britain's highest court ordered the Department for the Environment to submit new air quality plans by the end of the year setting out radical ways of tackling pollution.\n\nSupreme Court justices (IMAGE: Heathcliff O'Malley)\n\nEnvironmental and motoring groups said that diesel cars and trucks were likely to be targeted because they emit the largest amount of nitrogen dioxide. Freight companies predicted that diesel drivers would be offered incentives to scrap their vehicles or face stiff new taxes.\n\nHowever Edmund King of the AA warned that the 11 million motorists who were 'misled' into buying diesel cars during Gordon Brown's 'dash for diesel' would feel betrayed.\n\n\"There have been confusing messages and the goal now seems to have changed from encouragement to the demonising of diesel,\" said Mr King.\n\n\"This won't just affect big polluting trucks, but taxi drivers and families with people-carriers as well. This could drive down the value of cars dramatically.\n\n\"We all want better air quality but knee-jerk reactions without considering the science will not help air quality, industry or drivers.\"\n\n* Diesel car drivers paying \u00a33 more than they should to fill tanks\n\nIn 2001, Mr Brown, the then chancellor, overhauled vehicle excise duty so that cars that emitted a higher level of carbon dioxide faced a higher level of vehicle excise duty.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown\n\nThe move prompted a profound shift towards diesel cars, which produce lower levels of carbon dioxide because they are about 20 per cent more efficient than petrol engines.\n\nOver the past decade, the number of diesel cars on Britain's roads has risen from 1.6\u2009million to more than 11\u2009million and accounts for a third of vehicles.\n\nHowever Labour's plan failed to take into account that diesel vehicles emit 10 times the fine particles and up to twice the nitrogen dioxide, which has been linked to 7,000 deaths each year.\n\nOn Wednesday Lord Carnwath sitting in London's Supreme Court found that the UK had breached article 13 of the EU Air Quality Directive which demanded that nitrogen dioxide levels were cut to 40 micrograms of per cubic metre by 2010.\n\n* Which should I buy? Petrol v diesel\n\nOn present projections will not even fully hit the target by 2030, with London, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire predicted to be still over the healthy limit. Currently 38 out of 43 zones in the UK are in breach of the directive.\n\nThe UK is also facing similar proceedings in the European Court of Justice where it could be fined millions for not reducing pollution levels.\n\nCaroline Russell, Green Party Local Transport Spokesperson said the government must take steps to prevent diesel vehicles entering towns.\n\n\"Diesel vehicles, even the latest Euro 6 standard, are polluting and dangerous to our health,\" she said. \"We must limit their use in towns and cities with ultra-low emission zones.\"\n\n* Diesel car drivers feel betrayed\n\nBut Richard Gane, director and transport sector specialist at supply chain company Vendigital, warned that phasing out diesel could have major implications for businesses.\n\n\"If the Government decides to fast forward its plans to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, this would add weight to the growing environmental lobby against diesel-engine vehicles and potentially could lead to them being phased out, perhaps via an incentivised scrappage scheme,\" he said.\n\n\"For businesses that rely on regular road transport deliveries, any movement away from diesel engine vehicles would have significant supply chain implications.\n\n\"Businesses will be hoping that any plans be offset by incentives that will enable them to switch to greener models.\"\n\nThe Department for the Environment said that it could not comment on changes for diesel owners because of the upcoming election. But it said the government was committed to revising plans by the end of the year and complying with EU limits 'in the shortest possible time.'\n\nThe ruling was welcomed by the British Heart Foundation, Asthma UK and Friends of the Earth.\n\n* Air pollution could increase risk of dementia\n\nA spokesman for BMW, which manufactures the MINI brand at a plant in\n\nOxfordshire, said: \"As far as the ruling is concerned we do need to take a\n\nlook at that.\"\n\nThe MINI car plant in Oxforshire\n\n\"As for the future of the diesel engine, I think for quite some time it's\n\nbeen clear that we've had a development strategy that is improving the\n\nefficiency of our petrol and diesel engines but also seeing the\n\nintroduction of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n\n\"There's a constant strive to remove tailpipe emission altogether. As far\n\nas a time frame for that is concerned I wouldn't be so bold as to put one\n\non that. But I would certainly point to the cars we've launched recently as\n\nsteps in the right direction.\"\n\n* Car industry fumes about the 'demonisation' of diesel engines\n\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and\n\nTraders (SMMT), said: \"Industry recognises the issues around air quality\n\nand is keen to see policy that reflects the progress made on vehicle\n\nemissions and wider challenges of CO2 reduction.\"\n\n\"Policies to improve air quality should focus on encouraging the uptake of\n\nthe latest low emission vehicles, while also addressing other sources such\n\nas electricity generation and heating, which between them account for more\n\nthan half of NOx emitted in the UK.\n\n\"Today's diesel engines are the cleanest ever, high tech filters capture\n\n99% of particulates and NOx emissions are down 84% since 2000.\"\n\nA spokesman for the SMMT added: \"We're stressing that this isn't just an\n\nissue with diesel engines. This is something that encompasses many other\n\nsectors as well.\"\n\n\"When you look at the UK-wide figure, road transport accounts for 27 per\n\ncent of emissions while electricity generation is around 30 per cent.

We're most likely quite loyal, preferring to drive a car with a blue and white roundel on the hood. We are the kind of people who enjoy the odd, quirky cars that most enthusiasts groan about because we understand them more than most people.\n\nBMW has had its fair share of success. The 3 Series, 5 Series and 7 Series have all defined their segments. Whenever an all-new car debuts from a different automaker, people always compare it to one of BMWs. For instance, when the Cadillac CT6 first showed, people wanted to know whether or not it was competing with the 7 Series or 5 Series. So BMW has most definitely left its mark on the automotive industry and is a large player in the innovation of it. However, the Bavarians haven't always been perfect, and have made some bumbles along the way.\n\nA somewhat recent misstep came in the form of a car that I hold quite dear, the E36 3 Series. Not the standard car, which was obviously fantastic (yay, E36s), but the E36 3 Series Compact. The Compact was a three-door hatchback version of the 3 Series, which came in a couple of different flavors. The 318ti was the only one to travel Stateside, but there were the 316i, 323ti and 318tds diesel models as well. The 3 Series Compact was an interesting vehicle, as it was actually not bad at all, but it was quite ugly. Even though some purists may disagree.\n\nFrom the A Pillar forward, it was standard 3 Series and used the standard 3 Series McPherson front suspension. From the A Pillar rearward, it was a very different car, using the rear semi-trailing arm suspension from the E30, instead of the E36's multi-link setup. It also only came with three-doors and had a strange looking hatch. The proportions just never looked right, which is a shame, because as a rear-wheel drive BMW hatchback with that short of a wheelbase, the 3 Series Compact is actually very fun to drive. The rear suspension isn't as good as the standard E36s, so it isn't as playful or planted, but the short wheelbase allows for nippy turn in and fun handling.\n\nThe US version was powered by a 1.8 liter M42, four-cylinder engine, producing 138 hp. In 1996, BMW introduced a 1.9 liter M44 engine, producing a whopping 142 hp. These weren't powerful engines and the Compact wasn't very fast. In fact, it was quite slow. But, when paired with a manual, it was quite fun to drive. It goes back to that old mantra of driving a slow car at its limit instead of a fast car nowhere near it. The Compact was a plucky little car that was able to put a smile on your face and a BMW badge on your hood for a decent price. If only it looked better.\n\nThe 318ti, at least here in the 'States, has gained a very large cult following. As a frequent forum browser, I see many threads about Compact 3 Series', and the various mods people do to them. They are actually great first cars, or weekend toys, because they are dirt cheap to buy and fix, and relatively easy as well. So people love to buy cheap models and modify them until they're a shell of their former selves. While normally I look down on such modifications, the Compact is ugly enough to where it isn't offensive to do so.\n\nSo, while the 3 Series Compact was a bit of a dog, looks-wise, it had a lot of heart and punched above its weight class in terms of fun. If you ever stumble across an unmolested example for sale, and the price is low, consider it as a project or toy. It's bound to bring fun and levity to your weekend car ownership.", "The new Mini-E will have the potential to be even more \"electric\" than the i3. The new Mini-E will be introduced circa 2019, a two-door hatch\n\nThe technology in the expected new Mini-E will draw heavily from BMW's i3 innovations, just as Mini and BMW ICE cars now share engines and a platform. At the same time, the evolution of successive generations of BMW EVs will increasingly exploit the performance advantages and flexibility that electric drives offer, while quietly eliminating those design features that imitated some of the accepted limitations of ICE cars. The greatest potential for near-term electric drivetrain development will come from the synergy of single-pedal speed control, adoption of dual motors, and improved regenerative braking. Hopefully the new Mini-E will incorporate all of these features.\n\nNot too long ago car manufacturers touted how much their EVs were like their gas-powered counterparts, hoping to convince skeptical first-time buyers how familiar the EV driving experience would be -- \"it'll drive just like the car you have now.\" Some programmed in automatic-transmission \"creep\"; some piped in ICE exhaust sounds through the stereo. A couple of manufacturers even programmed simulated gear shifts in their single-speed electric drives. Many automotive pundits decried \"range anxiety,\" and suggested that EVs should ideally have the same range as ICE vehicles, without apparently considering that electrical vehicles can start out every morning with a full charge. Regenerative braking, not well understood by most drivers (including many automotive journalists), was typically activated through the same pedal that controlled the friction brakes.\n\nThen BMW introduced the i3 spaceship! It was revolutionary. It didn't look like anything that had ever been driven down a road, it was made of carbon fiber, both acceleration and braking were controlled with the same pedal, and it was fast and nimble. But that was just the opening salvo.\n\nThe new Mini-E will have the potential to be even more \"electric\" than the i3. And the second-generation i3 will continue that evolution.\n\nThe key piece of this evolutionary development is the i3's single-pedal speed control (the driver interface), coupled with the motor controller (a powerful computer). As the automotive world is discovering, with a software-controlled electric drivetrain, only the designer's imagination sets the limits on vehicle control (well, that and driver acceptance).\n\nBMW i3 drivers report they seldom have need to use the friction brake pedal. They control the car with the steering wheel and the speed pedal. With the addition of a second motor (driving the front wheels), the single-pedal speed control could become much more powerful.\n\nThe traditional advantages of all-wheel drive are obvious -- improved traction and handling, especially in slick conditions. In ICE vehicles, AWD carries the costs of added complexity and weight (and money), and the intrusion on internal space from the longitudinal drive shaft tunnel. With an EV, these drawbacks are largely non-existent; instead of a small motor at one end of the car, you have two smaller motors, one for each axle. Supporting structure would be lighter for each, and mechanical stresses (and wear) would be lower. The combined power and torque would likely be made greater than that of the single motor they replaced -- for more flexibility and better performance.\n\nWith EVs, there is another very important advantage to having dual motors -- greatly improved regenerative braking (\"regen\"). During braking, some of a car's weight shifts from the rear to the front wheels (due to the car's center of gravity being higher than the tires' contact patch on the pavement -- basic physics). As a result, the front brakes do most of the work, more so with stronger braking (that's why repeated aggressive braking covers the front wheels with brake pad dust).\n\nWith EV regenerative braking, only those wheels connected to the drive motor are able to slow the car. In the case of the i3, that's the rear wheels. That's fine for mild and moderate braking, but for strong braking, weight shift makes the rear wheel braking much less effective, and prone to skidding -- the four-wheel friction brakes would have to be used.\n\nSome early i3 owners reported what seemed to be a \"sudden acceleration\" of the car when they were using regenerative braking in low-traction situations (say, downhill turns on slick roads). What was actually happening was the i3's traction control was shutting off the regen to avoid a potentially dangerous skid. The unexpected loss of braking made it seem the car had suddenly surged ahead -- a scary event if you're heading into a sharp turn toward a stop sign.\n\nRegen in a dual-motor EV would not be subject to those problems. Software would control the percentage of braking handled front and rear, depending on conditions. The four-wheel regen could be as effective and consistent as friction brakes, and without the need to shift your foot between pedals.\n\nTesla seems already to have made the move to dual motors, after the success of its P85D. Its new base Model S, the 70D, has dual motors, and the upcoming Model X will only be available with dual motors. Besides greater traction and improved regenerative braking, Tesla has found that by separately controlling the power sent to each of the two motors to suit changing driving demands, they can attain greater efficiency (and longer range), and greater performance. Double the number of motors and you have more than doubled the ways you can control an electric car.\n\nWith the success Tesla is seeing with dual motors in their cars, I would be surprised if the mainstream Model 3 does not also have dual motors. And if that happens, any future BMW or Mini EV with only one drive motor would be hard pressed to call itself \"premium.\" Nissan LEAF, anyone?\n\nWhat would more powerful (and reliable) regenerative braking mean to the driver? In a nutshell -- more effective and predictable braking. The caveat is that the driver has to understand how it works.\n\nWith the i3's single-pedal speed control, the driver is able to seamlessly control the level of regen from zero to maximum by the amount they lift up on the pedal. Of course, quickly lifting your foot completely off the pedal immediately engages maximum regen, and many drivers (and reviewers) mistakenly thought that was how the i3's regen was engaged -- all or nothing.\n\nThere is no established convention for how EV regenerative braking should work -- it tends to be different from one manufacturer to the next. I recently read comments on Model S regen on the Tesla forum, and it was revealing that there was no agreement even among owners about how their regen worked.\n\nAnd of course many EV owners react to sudden changes in traffic patterns by reverting to long-held ICE habits, quickly lifting their foot off the \"gas pedal\" and expecting to gradually slow (coast). If they are traveling at high speed on a busy highway, a sudden unexpected braking caused by strong regen would be unnerving, or even dangerous.\n\nA BMW i engineer told me they programmed the level of the i3's maximum regen as a function of speed. At lower speeds, maximum regen would be strong, but as the car's speed increased, maximum regenerative braking was reduced. Why? There was no technical reason to do this. In fact, the faster the motor/generator spins, the stronger the regen can be -- if it is programmed to do so. BMW reduced the level of regen at high speeds simply because drivers participating in their Active E test program asked for it.\n\nOne would expect that a driver could react to changes in traffic better if they always had instant access to strong regenerative braking. But old habits die hard, especially in stressful situations. As i3 drivers gain more time and miles, old habits undoubtedly change -- but only to the extent the car allows. If the car is programmed to reinforce their old habits, the full potential of EVs will not soon be realized.\n\nHow can a manufacturer accommodate engrained ICE habits, while fostering driver acceptance of advanced EV capabilities? The answer is, of course, software. Give the driver a choice. Let the driver go into the menu and select values for a range of parameters, such as the maximum level of regenerative braking at both city and highway speeds. Let the driver's skills evolve.\n\nAdapt the car to the driver, rather than making the driver adapt to the car. Comfort mode, eco pro, sport, race, insane . . .\n\nControl. If you're BMW or Mini, building driver's cars, give the EV driver more control over the drivetrain.\n\nImagine driving a 2500-pound Mini-E with dual-motor power and traction, aggressive four-wheel regenerative braking, all seamlessly controlled by a single-pedal, coming up on a twisty stretch of deserted road . . . Exquisite control.\n\nA future true?\n\nWith my crystal ball before me (and rose-colored glasses firmly in place), I'm looking out through the next five hazy years. BMW i and Mini EV planning will mesh. New battery technology will permit more design choices, and as the number of electric models grows, the needs of different market segments can be accommodated.\n\nA mid-life refresh for the first-generation i3 will bring an improved battery and greater range. Fewer buyers will opt for the REx version.\n\nThe new Mini-E will be introduced circa 2019, a two-door hatch (Mini's bread and butter). With 120-mile range, this personal car will emphasize handling, performance, and lightness. It will be built with the same construction materials and tire size as the i3, the same single-pedal speed control, and a dual-motor drive train.\n\nThe second-generation i3 will be launched around 2020, also with dual motors. It will be a little longer for better highway performance. The rear coach doors will be replaced with traditional doors for easier access to the back seat (which will accommodate three). It will go 200 miles on a charge; a REx version will no longer be an option (increasing interior space).\n\nAround the same time, the long-rumored i5 will finally be released with the same new battery chemistry as the 2nd-gen i3, but in plug-in hybrid form. It will be larger than the i3, inside and out, with more luxury features -- a very comfortable and fast highway cruiser.\n\nOkay, so my crystal ball is a fake, but that's what the rose-colored glasses are for.", "COIMBATORE: Luxury car major BMW India has increased localisation in its vehicles to 50 per cent, which is in keeping with the Make-in-India programme, a top company official said today.\n\n\"The higher localisation has enabled us to address challenges like inflation in emerging markets such as India,\" BMW Group India President, Philipp Von Sahr, told reporters here.\n\nHe was replying to a specific query on the company's contribution to Make-in-India programme.\n\nSahr said BMW has localised production of engines and gearboxes at its Chennai plant with a capacity to produce 14,000 vehicles per year and added that about 95 per cent of cars sold in India are produced in Chennai.\n\nBMW currently assembles eight models from its Chennai plant, including the flagship 7, 5 and 3 series sedans, he said, adding that the capacity utilisation, at about 60-70 per cent, could go up in future in line with the demand.\n\nAsked about year-on-year growth, Sahr said the group believes in long-term growth of Indian market.\n\n\"India is one of the few bright spots in the global economy and the demand for luxury cars is quite good.

It was introduced some time around 1400 in Middle English and denotes competition of various kinds. Superman vs. Batman, Batman vs. Joker, Army vs. Navy - you name it. In the automotive world, we like to think that the biggest rivalry of all time is BMW vs. Mercedes and a brand new chapter in that story has opened up, the battle between the X4 and the GLC Coupe.\n\nBMW is widely credited with inventing the Sports Activity Coupe. We are talking about the X6, launched in 2007 and considered to be one of the most controversial cars of its time. For years, other companies pondered how they would introduce a rival, yet the Bavarians themselves were the first to capitalize on their own success. In 2014, the 2nd-generation arrived, and it was preceded by the slightly smaller X4 model. It is based on the same platform as the X3 and could be considered a success as well.\n\n2015 is the year Mercedes-Benz's retaliation finally came. At the Detroit Auto Show, they presented the big GLE Coupe, which rivals the X6, and they followed that up with the GLC Coupe, a preview for the X4 fighter.\n\nIn 2013, the Concept X4 was shown at the Shanghai Auto Show, which means BMW has a lead of exactly 2 years over Mercedes. But how are the X4 and GLC Coupe different in terms of design or engineering? That's what we want to find out.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mercedes model is only a concept at the moment. That's why we used photos of BMW's 2013 concept, so you guys can't base your opinions on unjust features. It's apples and oranges sort of stuff!\n\nEngines and transmissions\n\nWe have no idea what the GLC Coupe actually weighs, but we do know it will be based on the same platform as the W205 C-Class and will offer the same types of engines, 4- and 6-cylinder ones.\n\nStarting from the top and working our way to the bottom, we will mention the GLC 450 AMG Coupe, which will be the most powerful unit. A 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 will be used to deliver exactly 367 PS through a 7-speed 7G-Tronic automatic to the all-wheel drive system. A 333 PS version of the same engine will be offered in the GLE 400 Coupe model.\n\nRight now, the most powerful petrol-powered version of the BMW X4 is the xDrive35i, good for 306 PS. However, the Bavarians might retaliate soon with a twin-turbo inline-6 that makes about 370 PS some time in the future.\n\nTwo other petrol-engined models exist, the 184 PS xDrive20i and the 245 PS xDrive28i, both with 2-liter turbos. Come 2016, Mercedes is going to retaliate with nearly identical versions of the GLC Coupe, the 250 and 300.\n\nThe turbodiesel range is where BMW's X4 becomes untouchable, as the xDrive35i pushes out 313 PS and 630 Nm (465 lb-ft) from its 3-liter twin-turbo. Mercedes simply doesn't have that kind of engine, so the GLC Coupe will have to make due with the 2.1-liter CDI block in two output configurations.\n\nHowever, BMW has already fitted the X4 with its B47D20 new-gen diesel engine for the xDrive20d. It's smooth and uniformly delivers power, which explains why the majority of European buyers order it. The overall advantage in the diesel war goes to the X4.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive drivetrains of these two raised coupes aren't designed for serious off-road use. Instead of locking mechanical diffs, they use electronics to divert the torque where it's needed. Still, both will be able to reach places inhospitable to a C-Coupe or 4 Series. Until Mercedes starts production of the GLC Coupe, and we find out what it's like, we have to give the advantage to BMW in the gearbox department. They use ZF's excellent 8-speed automatic, which we prefer to the 7G-Tronic recently tested on the 2015 GLK-Class.\n\nOverall dimensions\n\nFrom bumper to bumper, the GLC Coupe concept measures 4.73 meters (186.2 inches), which means it is 6 centimeters or about 2.5 inches longer than a BMW X4. We believe that this is due to the design at the back, which is streamlined to copy that of the upcoming C-Class Coupe.\n\nHowever, the wheelbase is almost the same, 2.83 meters (111.4 inches) for the Merc and 2.810 in the case of the X4. No other specifications are available for comparison, but at a glance, the BMW has a taller greenhouse with more rear headroom.\n\n(Styling\n\nFinally, we have to talk about styling, which is always going to be the most important aspect of something that has \"coupe\" in its name. This is a very tricky subject because no two buyers are going to have the same opinion.\n\nLike we said earlier in this article, the photo comparison shows the BMW X4 Concept from 2013's Shanghai Auto Show in parallel with the GLC Coupe Concept from this year. If you want to see the X4 production model, the best place for that is our review, which featured a very attractive red car with the xDrive35i engine and M Sport body kit.\n\nMercedes will take a similar approach to satisfying its customers' diverse needs. An AMG Line kit will give basic diesel cars compromise-free looks while a selection of wheels and paint will complete the package.\n\nFrom the front, we think the BMW X4 is at a slight disadvantage because it is based on the older X3 model. Christopher Weil and his team could only hide the boxy front end behind a set of enlarged air intakes and tweaked headlights. Mercedes, meanwhile, has made a protruding grille with a gigantic emblem that's sure to get noticed.\n\nThe profiles of both cars are energetic and distinctive. Because they are shorter than full-size SUVs, the curve of the roof is not that elegant, but chunky rocker panels and character lines give off muscular appearances and draw the eye away from the flaws.\n\nAround the back, it's our opinion that BMW did a better job. Why? Because the X4's taillights are designed to look like those of the X6, which makes sense. Meanwhile, the GLC Coupe unsuccessfully copies the S-Class. Not everything is supposed to look the same, Daimler!\n\nRivals\n\nThis story would be complete without mentioning a few of the rivals that are coming up on our radar. Audi has already confirmed the development of the Q6, which should arrive sometime after 2016. Porsche is also thinking of chopping its SUVs in the future, but the Macan already has a sloped roof and looks just as nice as these two models. Volkswagen might also join the fight if or when the Cross Coupe GTE concept enters production.", "Ford announced Wednesday that it is recalling 50,157 vehicles in the U.S., Canada and Mexico for potentially defective fuel pumps.\n\nThe defect applies to components installed in the 2014 Ford Focus, Edge, Escape and Transit Connect and 2014-15 Ford Fiesta with Bosch fuel pumps. The nickel plating in the pumps can fail, resulting in contamination, increased friction and eventual failure.\n\nBosch pumps plated with the same process as those found in the recalled Ford models have been at the center of campaigns launched by Volkswagen Group, BMW and Nissan.\n\nFailed fuel pumps can result in affected cars being unable to start, or engine stalls if the failure occurs while they are in use. If the vehicle is rendered inoperable while in use, it could result in a crash.\n\nOne incident has been reported to Ford that may be linked to this issue, but Ford did not report that anybody involved was injured.", "The European markets dropped sharply Wednesday, largely due to uncertainty ahead of an announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The euro also extended its recent gains against the U.S. dollar today, which put added pressure on shares of exporters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will conclude its 2-day policy meeting this afternoon. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but traders will be paying close attention to any changes to the accompanying statement. Traders will be looking for signals regarding the possibility of a rate hike in June, although a recent batch of disappointing economic data has led many analysts to speculate that any rate hike will be delayed.\n\nWhile U.S. economic growth in the first three months of 2015 was expected to be weak due to the severe winter weather, the Commerce Department released a report on Wednesday showing that the gross domestic product increased by even less than anticipated.\n\nThe Commerce Department said U.S. GDP inched up by just 0.2 percent in the first quarter following the 2.2 percent growth seen in the fourth quarter. The modest uptick compared to economist estimates for an increase of about 1.0 percent.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised further the ceiling on emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks amid lingering uncertainty regarding the government's reform proposals, reports said Wednesday, citing sources.\n\nThe emergency funding cap was raised to EUR 76.9 billion from EUR 75.5 billion last week.\n\nUnder the ELA scheme, the Bank of Greece provides funding to the country's solvent banks.

In addition, the repo rate path has been lowered significantly.\n\nThe Executive Board of the Riksbank on Wednesday decided to purchase government bonds for a further SEK 40-50 billion and left the key rate unexpectedly at -0.25 percent but signaled further reduction.\n\nRiksbank was expected to cut its rate to -0.35 percent today. The bank last reduced it in March by 15 basis points after taking it to negative zone in February.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased by 2.50 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 2.07 percent.\n\nThe DAX of Germany dropped by 3.21 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell by 2.59 percent. The FTSE of the U.K. declined by 1.20 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 1.67 percent.\n\nIn Frankfurt, Volkswagen declined by 3.64 percent.

The oil and gas company said its first-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders declined to 704 million euros from 1.30 billion euros last year.\n\nEurozone economic confidence weakened unexpectedly in April as Greece crisis started to dampen activity, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday. Meanwhile, bank lending grew for the first time in three years in March.\n\nThe economic sentiment index fell to 103.7 from 103.9, which was the highest score since July 2011, survey results published by the European Commission revealed. Economists had forecast the indicator to remain unchanged at 103.9 in April.\n\nLending to euro area households and firms increased for the first time in three years in March and money supply growth accelerated more-than-expected after the announcement of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank.\n\nBank lending rose 0.1 percent in March from the prior year, reversing a 0.1 percent fall in February. Adjusted for loan sales and securitization, credit to the private sector climbed 0.8 percent, following February's 0.6 percent increase.\n\nA measure of future economic activity in Eurozone rose for the fifth successive month in March, signaling sustained improvement in economic activity for the coming months, the Conference Board said Wednesday. The Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the euro area climbed 0.7 percent to 105.1, after a 0.6 percent rise in February.\n\nGerman consumer prices increased for the third straight month to a 5-month high in April, preliminary data from Destatis showed Wednesday. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in April, the fastest since November when prices grew 0.6 percent. Inflation also matched economists' expectations. This was the third consecutive rise in prices.\n\nU.K. retail sales are forecast to pick up next month after recording a slowdown in April, results of the Distributive Trades Survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed Wednesday. The retail sales balance fell to +12 percent from +18 percent in March. Economists had forecast it to rise to 25 percent.\n\nU.K. house prices increased at the fastest pace since June 2014, the Nationwide Building Society reported Wednesday. House prices were up 1 percent in April from the prior month, the strongest growth since June 2014.

Well, our spy photographers caught this rare whale out testing and sent a set of photos our way immediately.\n\nIn case you didn't know, in China, culture dictates you offer as much space to your passengers as possible. That's why BMW and other manufacturers create special versions of their most popular cars that have longer wheelbases. The 3 Series is no exception.\n\nAs a matter of fact, all the 3ers sold in China have a couple of extra inches in between the axles. The facelift will continue in this fashion as we can see a prototype out testing just before it enters production.\n\nIf the longer door in the back isn't an obvious indicator, the chrome detail in the C-Pillar is a dead giveaway. Just like on the European and American models, the front and rear ends of the car have been camouflaged to keep our eyes away from the styling updates.\n\nWe can guess that the headlights and taillights will get a different design even though they'll keep the overall shape intact. Up front, the corona rings will probably be closer to the current trend that sees them becoming sleeker and connected to the grille.\n\nRound the back, any guess is welcome. Most likely, LED strips will be used but we can't vouch for that right now.\n\nThe biggest changes will come under the bonnet though, as we told you before. Apart from a new plug-in hybrid model, the new 3 Series will also get two new models and the B-family of modular engines.\n\nRanging from 3-cylinder 1.5-liter units to the 2-liter and even 3-liter inline 6-cylinder ones. Initially we thought that the 7 Series will be the first BMW to use the new B58 engine but with the introduction of the 340i version, the Germans are offering this 'honor' to the 3 Series, their most popular car.\n\nRecent leaks point to a 326 HP / 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) output that would make the B58M plant just as capable as the N55 units on the M135i and M235i models. The 330i version that will be replacing the 328i will use a turbocharged 2-liter plant making close to 260 HP.\n\nInside the cabin, not much will change but we do expect more tech like the one seen on the 1 Series LCI, which includes a new Navigation system and all sorts of assistants for highway driving and parking.

So when Apple launches a new gadget, like this year's Apple Watch, people stand up and notice, and then get in line to buy one.\n\nBut beyond its wow factor, is Apple's new smartwatch a valuable addition to your in-car infotainment system?\n\nUnless you've been hiding under a pile of used tires, you probably already know a little about Apple's first entry into the smartwatch arena. In addition to basic time keeping functions, the wrist worn device offers up info about fitness tracking and \"health-oriented\" functions. It also integrates wirelessly with other Apple products, like the iPhone, for many of its basic functions, like making phone calls and texting.\n\nLet's debate: Is the world ready for an Apple i Car?\n\nFirst announced last fall -- followed by a winter of relentless hype that only the cult of Apple seems to be able to generate -- the Apple Watch has been available for pre-order since early April. Shipping started just in the past week. In Canada, you can buy Apple's smartwatch online at the Apple Store. Depending on what type of case and band you pick, prices start from $449 for various models of the Watch Sport to $699 for the Watch to $13,000 for the 18-carat gold Watch Edition.\n\nNew Apple Watches are seen on display at the Apple Grand Central Station store on April 24, 2015 in New York. The Apple Watch debuted in selected global markets Friday with sales limited to clients who had pre-ordered online, making the launch a relatively low-key affair compared to tech titan's usual fanfare.\n\nDON EMMERT, AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore and more new car buyers cite smartphone integration as one of the key features when shopping for a new vehicle. And although it's still early days to see how popular the Apple Watch will become, we decided to take a look at what Apple Watch apps are currently available, check out a potential rival, and see if buyers should start considering Apple's latest device when shopping for a new vehicle.\n\nCurrently, there's only a handful of Apple watch apps available that would be of some assistance to drivers. Some are for travellers in general, while a couple of them are automotive-specific.\n\nFor instance, in some cities, the Payphone Parking app will allow you to pay at a metre, check the amount of time remaining, and send you a 10-minute warning when your time is up, at which time, you can pay for more time, all from your Apple Watch. There is also the Dark Sky weather app, which will give you a one-hour warning for imminent rain or snow in your location. A weather app with weather warnings might help you plan your trips better.\n\nFor now, there is only a pair of Apple Watch-specific apps available from automakers, both of which are extensions of existing iPhone apps and limited to a handful of low-volume, luxury vehicles.\n\nThe BMW i Remote Apple Watch App only works with the new BMW i3 compact hatchback and the i8 sports car plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.\n\nLike the i Remote App for the iPhone, the smartwatch version will tell you about your vehicle battery's charging status and vehicle range, set departure times to optimize battery usage, and perform a variety of remote functions (like lock doors or start up the air-conditioning).\n\nPorsche's Smart Watch integration is pretty slick.\n\n,\n\nSimilar to BMW's Apple Watch app, Porsche's Car Connect riffs off the German automaker's current iPhone app's ability to give you information about your vehicle, and a few remote functions -- such as locating your Porsche in a parking lot, folding its exterior mirrors, setting a timer for charging electrified Porsches, or reading your vehicle's tire pressure, among other features.\n\nAvailable only for 2014 and 2015 models of the Porsche Panamera mid-size hatchback, 918 Spyder plug-in electric super sports car and Macan and Cayenne SUVs, you must also have a Porsche Car Connect unit in your vehicle for the app to work.\n\nWhile the BMW and Porsche apps are available today, there is another automotive smartwatch app in the works for non-Apple users.\n\nOn 2013 or newer models, Hyundai's BlueLink wireless connectivity app gives Google Android smartphone users the ability to honk the horn, turn on the lights, lock/unlock the doors, locate the vehicle, call roadside assistance, schedule a service appointment and send a destination to their car's navigation system.\n\nAnd as a direct competitor to the Apple Watch, a BlueLink app for Android Wear smartwatches (like the Motorola Moto 360) has been announced, but has yet to become available.\n\nHyundai's BlueLink smartwatch app.\n\nHyundai,\n\nBeyond offering only a few automotive-specific apps, if the Apple Watch becomes as commonplace as the iPhone, developers and automakers will jump on the bandwagon. Even so, the Apple Watch -- or any smartwatch -- has a few limitations.\n\nFor starters, integrating the Apple Watch with your vehicle is not as simple as strapping it on your wrist.\n\nThere's the issue of device redundancy. The majority of the Watch's functions can only be accessed via an on-board iPhone, which you shouldn't be using while driving, any way.\n\nLearn why texting behind the wheel is as bas as driving while drunk\n\nPlus, like any Internet-based app, the functionality varies depending on where you live and the options available in your vehicle. It also means it uses data to get information, which could get expensive, depending on your phone plan.\n\nThen there's the \"driver distraction\" bug-a-boo. Is it safer to turn over your wrist to look at your smartwatch? Or dig out your smartphone from your pocket?\n\nAs we said, it's still early days for the Apple Watch. Who knows at this point if Apple's wrist device will become as ubiquitous as the other products from the American behemoth?

A total of 487,301 cars are included, and despite this corrosion problem surfacing across the national fleet, Ford is allowed by federal regulators to restrict the recall to vehicles that were ever sold or registered in 20 \"salt belt\" states and Washington, D.C. Ford has not reported any injuries or accidents. Dealers will replace the bolts, cover them in a rustproof sealant, and replace any damaged steering gear.\n\nAlso on 2015 MKZ sedans: When the headlamps are switched on, the parking lamps are too bright under federal regulations. Dealers will update the software on 21,435 cars to dim the lights appropriately.\n\nOn 2014 Focus, Edge, Escape, Transit Connect and 2014-2015 Fiesta models, the fuel pumps have nickel plating that can loosen and plug the impeller -- the rotor that spins and drives the fuel into the line -- which can cut the flow of gasoline. This means the cars may not start or may stall while driving. Ford is aware of one crash due to the faulty fuel pumps, which were also used by at least three other manufacturers including Nissan, BMW, and Volkswagen/Audi. Those recalls are covered here. Dealers will replace the entire fuel pump assembly.\n\nFinally, a few workers at the Dearborn truck plant neglected to install heat shields on a few 2015 F-150 pickups. Over a two-day span, Ford said 73 F-150s left the factory with either missing shields or fasteners. A missing shield could pose a fire risk when the truck is idling over grass or other easily ignitable surfaces. Dealers will make sure the shields are installed and screwed tight.\n\nFord did not specify a time frame for any of these recalls, nor was additional information available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.", "Turn 11 is a tight hairpin, and the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V accurately turns in, clips the apex, and powers out before rocketing down the long back straight, all 464 horses from its ferocious twin-turbo V-6 galloping madly. The head-up display briefly flashes 145 mph before the powerful Brembo calipers clamp down in anticipation of the fast-approaching tight left-hander. It was through this section at Circuit of the Americas (CoTA) in Austin, Texas, when it first hit me: BMW should be afraid, very afraid. The new Cadillac ATS-V is that good.The 2016 ATS-V is even more impressive when you consider Cadillac's V-series performance division hasn't played in this market segment before. The first- and second-generation CTS-V were \"tweeners,\" dancing between the BMW M3 and M5. The all-new ATS-V now sits at the same table as the BMW M3/M4.Just two-days before my journey to Austin for the Cadillac ATS-V press launch, I borrowed a friend's 2015 BMW M4. I've driven various examples of the latest BMW M3 (sedan) and M4 (coupe) in the recent past -- both on the road and at the track -- but I wanted the experience to be fresh in my brain. So after spending time in the BMW and Cadillac, here's my take on each car's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nCadillac ATS-V 3.6-liter twin-turbo V-6\n\nEngine Under the hood, the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V goes the classic American hot-rod route. Take an engine from a larger car -- in this case, the LF3 from the CTS Vsport -- and tweak it for more power. Cadillac changed enough bits on the twin-turbo, 3.6-liter V-6 to warrant a name change to LF4, and the updated engine betters the BMW's inline-six by the number 39 in both horsepower and torque.The power delivery of the Cadillac seems more natural to me as opposed to the giant midrange hit of the BMW M3/M4. No doubt the additional 0.6-liter of displacement the ATS-V engine enjoys over the BMW's twin-turbo, 3.0-liter inline-six is a big help here. As for the sonic assault, both cars pipe engine noise through the audio speakers, and both sound pretty mean as far as boosted sixes go.While I'd need a more direct comparison to render a final assessment on who makes the better overall engine, the Cadillac is most certainly in the game here.\n\nBMW M3 3.0-liter twin-turbo inline-six\n\nTransmissions As far as the manual boxes go, the BMW's six-speed, with its crisp and positive shifts, is my choice. The ATS-V deploys the Tremec TR-6060 from the outgoing CTS-V, albeit with updated ratios. Shift quality isn't bad, but it feels a bit like an old-school muscle car, and not in a good way. It's a touch clunky and notchy, especially when shifting into second gear. It's the same story with the automatic. Cadillac touts shift speeds that match most dual-clutch transmissions with its latest eight-speed torque-converter auto, but it simply doesn't shift as crisply or positively as BMW's dual-clutcher (or the ZF automatic in cars like the Jaguar F-Type, for that matter). You can also catch the Caddy's transmission out in manual mode. Touch the rev limiter before pulling for an upshift, and there is a frustrating delay. But leave the ATS-V's transmission to its own devices, and it works quite well, even on the track.\n\n2016 Cadillac ATS-V interior\n\nInterior Score another win for BMW in my book. As I noted in my Four Seasons Cadillac CTS Vsport update, Cadillac's interior design language is too glitzy, and the CUE system isn't fabulous. The layout inside the M3/M4 is more straightforward, and it looks and feels higher quality.But there's one important area of the cabin where the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V gets major kudos, the optional $2,300 Recaro performance seats. They're brilliant. They offer 18-way adjustment and hold you tightly on the track, all while being extremely comfortable on the street, at least based upon my brief time driving the ATS-V on public roads. The all-new seat is a huge improvement over the less-than-stellar Recaros that were available for the previous CTS-V.\n\n2015 BMW M3 interior\n\nExterior Style I'll give the nod to BMW here, but by a whisker. The ATS-V, especially in sedan form, is a very nice-looking car. It's aggressive and purposeful, without being too loud or showy. For the best-looking setup, avoid the rather disco (and expensive, at $6,195) Track package, with its especially large and not very cohesive body-color rear spoiler. Pick a subtle color (silver or gray), stay with the standard painted aluminum wheels, and you have a sophisticated, stylish sleeper.Still, the BMW is a touch nicer-looking, at least in my eyes. This is especially true in coupe form. I'm not a big fan of the ATS Coupe. There's too much sheetmetal between the rear wheels and the side glass. At least the ATS-V is wider, helping dull that visual shortcoming. On the Road My time in the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V on the road was limited, and I drove my friend's M4 DCT -- equipped with the optional Adaptive M suspension -- in Michigan (versus Texas) but from the seat of my pants the Cadillac simply lacks the last level of refinement offered by the BMW. It just doesn't feature the same rock-solid, straight-line stability of the German and hunts around some over changing road surfaces. I also feel the low-speed ride in the BMW is better, possibly due to more suspension travel. One additional note on the Cadillac involves a very subtle rear-end yawing motion under hard acceleration on the street. I initially thought this had something to do with the tuning of the electronic rear differential, but a chat with a V-series engineer revealed that it's related to the rear suspension geometry of the ATS. It's not exactly a problem, but you do sense it. It just adds to that underlying feeling that the BMW is just a touch more sophisticated and polished on public roads. At the Track Here's where the American takes the win, a big win, at least at an ultra-smooth track like CoTA. I was blown away by the ATS-V when thrashed. The chassis is extremely balanced, and the bespoke Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires offer gobs of grip. Large, six-piston Brembo brakes have no issues handling repeated extreme deceleration. A big part of the Caddy's track competence is the fantastic traction and stability control system, working in tandem with the standard electronic limited-slip differential. Performance Traction Management (PTM) has five settings, each adjusting engine torque output, stability (yaw) control, and traction control. Running in the PTM 5 setting, the ATS-V is an animal. It only leaves the traction control active -- and it's only there to help you go faster, not to save your ass. I later drove a track session with all systems disabled, and other than minding the throttle in low-speed corners, it was a pussycat, but still very rewarding and exciting. The BMW simply isn't as good as the Cadillac at the track in my opinion. The combination of the inferior stability-control tuning -- even in the most aggressive MDM mode -- and less linear power delivery means the M3/M4 is left struggling for traction, flickering the telltale dash light and dialing back power far too often as the rear wheels search for grip. Sure, you can turn the stability control system 100 percent off, but you're then left with a car that isn't as balanced or approachable as the ATS-V. One additional note: While the ATS-V's Track package might not be an attractive addition to the Cadillac, you can feel the extra downforce, especially in high-speed corners. More accurately, you miss the downforce when driving the standard car around a circuit. If you plan to regularly track your ATS-V, it would be a good idea to pony up for the pricey option and live with the peacock-like showmanship. Conclusion BMW's been in this game for 30 years. The ATS-V is round one for Cadillac. A quick, casual tally may show that BMW has more category wins but the track performance of the ATS-V is so impressive that we really need to put the two cars together and spend more time in each before making a final call. I will say this, based upon the indirect comparison and limited road driving in the ATS-V: If you're regularly visiting the track, buy the Cadillac. If you plan to drive your car primarily on the street and don't mind paying extra for features that come standard on the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V, then the BMW M3/M4 is likely the better car for you.", "The i3 might have a few signature flourishes, but it's different from any BMW you've ever driven. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nThere has never been a cool small electric car. Until now: the BMW i3.\n\nSure, big names like Toyota, Nissan, and Chevrolet have all tried their hardest to sell their plug-in electric vehicles as funky and desirable, but that's never really worked. No matter how you slice it, there's really nothing exciting or interesting about a Prius, Leaf, or Volt. True, the perception of electric cars is changing, thanks to Tesla's Model S and particularly the high-performance P85D version, but they're large and ultra-luxurious. If electric cars are going to be accepted and adopted by average folks, the small stuff has to be cool, too.\n\nHere's where the i3 is supposed to come in. It's currently the smaller and less expensive child of the BMW eco-minded \"i\" sub-family, the model lineup where BMW keeps its experimental and futuristic designs.\n\nLike its better-known brother, the i3 is made from lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic. But critically, the i3 is all-electric, and unlike most EVs, rear-wheel-drive. Like a good BMW should be.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you should take this for an electric sports car. If anything, it's a taste of what mainstream commuter cars can be in a few generations.\n\nExterior\n\nThe i3 is made of numerous unorthodox shapes, angles, and lines. It'll turns heads wherever you go. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nThe i3 is not a beautiful car, but it is certainly striking.\n\nYou could never accuse the BMW i3 of trying to fit in -- park it next to any other modern commuter car and you'll see what I'm talking about. It's not the prettiest thing out there, with its oddly curved side windows and perpetually serious face.\n\nIt's all about function. It has the trademark BMW kidney grill, but it's been sealed off because electric cars don't need air intakes. It's got a shell made from the same kind of carbon fiber material as the i8 supercar, but it's not painted. It has comically thin wheels, but they're there to minimize the car's footprint.\n\nNot a single person who saw it was shy about expressing their opinion of the i3, from the fawning (\"Oh that is adorable!\") to the rude (\"That's ugly\") to the elitist (\"It's not pretty enough to wear a BMW badge\"). In an era where most commuter cars are slowly evolving into the same amorphous shape, the i3 has a clearly defined character, and that's much better than blending in with the rank and file.\n\nInterior\n\nThe i3's interior is simple and artistic, populated by recycled plastics and re-purposed leathers. It's an open, airy design that you'd never mistake for anything else. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nThe i3 is certainly different on the outside, but the inside is a trip too.\n\nWhen you first sit in the i3, it doesn't feel so much like you're in a car. The seats don't hug you with the familiarity you've come to expect out of modern leather and bucket seats, especially in this price bracket. Instead you slide laterally onto thin, flat seats more reminiscent of park benches than luxury vehicles.\n\nYou sit upright on a firm base and place your feet on a completely flat floor, not unlike the position you're forced into when flying coach. Even if you recline the seat, it does little to mitigate the burden placed on your lower back. There's no separate lumbar adjustment on the seats, either.\n\nBMW's flat floorboard gives the front occupants plenty of space to stretch out, but those in back will have no such luck. There's almost no way you'll be able to fit four full-sized adults in the BMW i3 -- and that's assuming you could even convince them to sit back there in the first place. Even those around average height (5'6-5'8) will feel claustrophobic, trapped behind all behind the shortest front passengers. At least the front feels like an exit row in coach -- the rear feels like the last row before the bathrooms.\n\nThere's not much room in the back of the i3, unless you move the front seats all the way up. It's not a comfortable fit if you're not small in stature. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nThe rear suicide doors don't make things much easier, either. In theory, having suicide doors makes getting in and out of the back seats easier, but the i3 is small, and its rear doors will not open if the front doors aren't opened first. Say you're dropping friends or your children off somewhere -- you'll still need to open your door, get out of your seat, and open their door so they can get out.\n\nIt sounds like such an unpleasant place to be.\n\nAnd yet, it isn't. Where the i3 fails in comfort and support, it excels in atmosphere and aesthetic design. Seats aside, the i3 has an open, inviting cabin; the i3's high ceilings create a voluminous, airy feeling that you don't get in most vehicles this size. You can have eucalyptus on the dash. Add to that the well-paddled, widened portion of the door to hang your arm on, and the i3 becomes a late-night city cruiser.\n\nThe materials used inside the i3 are fantastic. Most things in the i3's interior are reclaimed or recycled in some way, but they never feel cheap.\n\nToys/Electronics\n\nLove it or hate it, BMW's iDrive is the central infotainment program in the i3. Personally, I'm not a fan of the complicated sub-menus, but at least the i3-specific eco-menus are relatively simple. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nAside from the electric powertrain (if you really want to count that as a toy), the i3 is surprisingly simple. Even in our test car, a mid-level \"Giga World\" trim, doesn't have any technological features that make it stand out from any other BMW. iDrive is there and the technology package gives you a rear-view camera with forward and rear collision warning. You don't get lane departure warnings or cameras, which is the sort of this Honda is equipping the Civic with as standard these days.\n\nThere's an energy consumption/recharging meter on the dash to track your progress, but that's about it.\n\nThe i3 certainly doesn't look quick, but it'll keep up with much more powerful cars off the line. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nWell, it's good, really.\n\nOnce you get past the absence of engine and drivetrain noise (and how spooky that can be for those unacquainted with electric vehicles), you'll find that the i3 has a wealth of power whenever and wherever you demand it; as with all electric powerplants, the i3's batteries provide instant torque. Combine that with the rather low curb weight (as far as electric vehicles go) and the i3 is no slouch. Zero to sixty takes about seven seconds -- that's not going to set any records, but it will keep you alongside a Fiesta ST long enough to make them sweat.\n\nIt's not the sprint to 60 MPH that really matters -- how often do you need that in the real world, anyway? -- it's the way the i3 goes from 20 to 40 MPH. The i3 has enough power at its disposal to carve up city traffic at any time and combined with its diminutive size, it can fit almost anywhere.\n\nBut power is nothing without control, or in this case good brakes. The i3 has a regenerative braking system much like other electric and electric hybrid cars. But BMW's system is aggressive: Once you let off the throttle, the brakes bite hard, whether or not you actually touch the brake pedal. As the car slows down, the brakes capture some kinetic energy and use it to recharge the batteries. It's eerie, but only at first -- once you get used to it, it becomes a game to see how long you can wait to actually step on the brakes. It's quite fun, actually. In a juvenile sort of way.\n\nIf you play it right, you spend most of your time in the i3 driving with one pedal. The regenerative brakes are so aggressive that they'll stop the car on their own, yet intelligent enough to make your stops smooth. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nAs a bonus, the captured energy can extend the i3's electric range, giving you a few more miles before the car flatlines. Which is helpful, because the i3 doesn't have a particularly large electric range; on battery power alone, BMW says the i3 will run for 80 miles on a single charge under the best circumstances. In the real world, where annoyingly slow traffic and some highways exist, I killed the i3's initial charge in 70 miles as I drove through the Holland Tunnel.\n\nThe potential range is most directly determined by the person behind the wheel, of course. But the i3 also has three modes to help influence your driving style: Comfort, which gives you all of the power and relaxes the regenerative braking; Eco Pro, which ramps up the braking and limits power in the name of efficiency; Eco Pro Plus, which has aggressive braking and limits top speed to 56 MPH.\n\nEco Pro Plus is infuriating if you're anywhere but gridlock, but it'll eke out every last mile possible. Eco Pro is livable (and has a customizable top speed, though the default is 70 MPH), but Comfort is what you really want.\n\nThe i3's \"Eco Pro+\" mode will net the largest electric range, but don't bother switching to it unless you're hypermiling. The car is limited to 56 MPH and actively encourages you to not use the accelerator. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nOur test car was equipped with the \"range extender,\" a 647 cc engine that kicks on when the batteries' natural charge has run out. In the best of instances, it can increase the i3's range by 60 miles. I'm not sure it's entirely worth the premium you pay for it, as it adds nearly 300 pounds to the i3's curb weight and makes an ugly sound when running.\n\nCombined, I managed 115 MPGe, slightly off the advertised 117 MPGe for the range extender model. Those numbers are inherently confusing, but the short version is this: it cost 3.6 cents/mile to travel in the i3. In contrast, it currently costs me ten cents/mile to power my personal car, assuming a gas price of $2.60/gallon.\n\nThough it's expensive to buy, the i3 is cheaper to run than any traditional car out there.\n\nHandling\n\nThe i3 has responsive, accurate steering, but the suspension doesn't want you to be too aggressive. The i3 will pitch and roll like a ball of dough, safely set up for understeer. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nIt's a BMW, so you might expect the i3 to be a fun car to throw around corners. That's a fair assumption, but also an incorrect one.\n\nThe i3 is tall, soft, and has some of the skinniest tires known to man since the automobile was invented. It wallows through corners and flounders if you ask it to change directions quickly. It's certainly not an ideal experience, but despite all that, it's never hard to place what the i3 is doing. The steering, though electric (obviously), is accurate and has gives good feedback through the steering wheel.\n\nWhen you set a suspension for comfort and smoothness, you're going to sacrifice agility and sharpness. In the i3, that's okay, because it's doubtful that anyone who buys it will really drive it hard. It's not going to goad you into driving like an idiot.\n\nExperience\n\nThe i3 is an intriguing machine, but it's not going to bring electric vehicles to the masses just yet. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nLet's address the biggest issue the electric car currently faces: range anxiety. The fear that you'll run out of power on the road. Knowing that you have a finite power source isn't the problem -- the problem is that electric cars still take a long time to recharge, and that's if you can even find a proper station in public\n\nA full charge at a BMW dealership took six hours and cost $13. Honestly, that's far too long to be without your only car. Unless you have a station installed at your home (which BMW will do, for a fee of course) electric cars can still require a heavy time commitment (Tesla Superchargers notwithstanding).\n\nThe one question every person asked (aside from \"How much does it cost\") was: \"Would you buy it over a Tesla?\" The answer to that is difficult; the two cars are not direct competitors, they're not anywhere near the same class, and a Tesla Model S is more than twice the price of a base i3. They have different consumers in mind.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you want a small electric vehicle but the mainstream offerings bore you, the i3 might just be your style. Nick Deel / International Business Times\n\nThe i3 can't be your only vehicle, it's certainly not affordable, and it's not as fun as traditional compacts, but it looks like nothing else on the road. And it's hard to put a price on that.", "Today, the BMW Performance Center in Greer, South Carolina, announced that it will be entering this year's One Lap of America challenge with a BMW X6 M. In doing so, they will be partnering up with BMW Manufacturing, BMW Performance Parts and IHG Rewards Club.\n\nThe event will kick off on May 2 and will see contestants leave from South Bend, Indiana on a 3,245 mile, 7 day route across eleven states. During their trip, the drivers will undergo time trials, drag racing, skid pad car control courses and, of course, long overnight transit stages.\n\nBehind the wheel of the new Sport Activity Coupe will be Michael Renner, BMW Performance Center Driving instructor joined by BMW Powertrain engineer Michael Broad and One Lap veteran Tom Lappin. The three will be competing in two classes: Truck/SUV and Stock Touring.\n\nIn case you're wondering why they chose the X6 M which is an SUV, let's run by the numbers once again. It's the most powerful car BMW ever made, with the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet making 575 HP and 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) of torque.\n\nIt's also the fastest SUV they made with a sprint that takes just 4.2 seconds to reach 100 km/h (62 mph). As if that wasn't enough, the new chassis layout and elastokinematics make it a rocket on the track as well, so the challenges that lay ahead won't be an issue at all.\n\nA sophisticated oil sump system works alongside multiple low and high pressure radiators, M Compound brakes and Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires make sure that the X6M is stable and well behaved both on track and off it.

However certain people claim they actually saw the upcoming Scrambler and it is real. Moreover, BMW is said to be already deep into testing the bike in a secured, closed facility, preventing any peering from overly curious eyes.\n\nHowever, the most interesting aspect of the recent rumors is that BMW is apparently restyling the R nineT so that it will try to steal Ducati Scrambler customers. Unfortunately, no spy shot of the R nineT Scrambler surfaced yet, so we're taking all this with a grain of salt.\n\nSense-driven restyling with Roland Sands involvement\n\nIf anything, such a move makes a lot of sense, and the BMW Scrambler could be a very interesting alternative to the Ducati one. For starters, it would be a neat machine that can confidently do off-road but at a fraction of the cost and bulk of the R1200GS. And a lot of people would like this, too.\n\nHaving Roland Sands/RSD involved in the project is a sure track to great-looking machinery. RSD has already been quite busy building the anniversary R nineT and already has a lot of experience with the bike. This means that the solutions he chooses will look like a natural extension of the platform, and this is also a good selling point.\n\nThird on the list is the spike in the customers' preferences for retro-ish/neo-retro motorcycles.

Photo: KAY NIETFELD/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY By Thao Hua Thao Hua The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyThao Hua @alantamedia thao.hua@wsj.com April 29, 2015 10:56 a.m. ET\n\nVolkswagen VOW3 -3.97 % 's Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn has won a battle, but he has yet to win the car maker's war.\n\nThe company on Wednesday reported a 17% rise in first-quarter operating profits. China contributed about half of that profit, partly due to favorable currency movements, helping to allay investor fears that a slowdown in sales there could add more weight to the CEO's already heavy burden.\n\nAn attempt to oust Mr. Winterkorn by former chairman Ferdinand Piech earlier this month led to the latter's resignation. Mr. Piech is largely credited with building Volkswagen into what it is today, but his empire-building strategy has also been expensive.\n\nENLARGE\n\nEven though the group is selling more cars, it is not yet benefiting from scale. This is down to cost. According to Evercore ISI, Volkswagen spent about 13.9 % of 2014 revenues on capital expenditure, including research and development, compared with 12.1% at BMW, BMW -3.19 % which also sells cars at prices that are on average about a third more expensive. Higher capital expenditure means higher annual depreciation, which hurts profitability. Labor is also more costly at 16.7% of sales compared with 12.1% at BMW for the same period, notes Evercore ISI.\n\nHigher spending hasn't translated into outperformance when compared with overall industry growth. Volkswagen's sales of passenger cars rose 2% in the first quarter year-over-year, compared with 3.7% for the sector globally. The most obvious problem is the U.S., where the company's unit sales shrank by 1.4% compared with about 5% broader market growth. Even in Asia-Pacific, Volkswagen's most important region, quarterly sales growth trailed the market and its market share contracted to 12.2% from 12.6% the year before.\n\nInvestors who are counting on a more disciplined approach following the departure of Mr. Piech may be disappointed. Volkswagen could trim capital expenditure, but there is little evidence of that in Mr. Winterkorn's strategic plans.\n\nBarring much stronger sales and pricing momentum, particularly at its namesake division, the group will need to hit its \u20ac10 billion ($11 billion) cost-cutting target by 2017. Some of this can be gained by ramping up production on its shared platforms, but the company will also need to trim labor expenses.\n\nIn Germany, that task could prove increasingly difficult. Mr. Winterkorn was backed by union representatives and the state of Lower Saxony during the recent power struggle, and he may feel beholden to keep labor on side.\n\nThe stock is valued at about 10 times 2015 earnings compared with 11 times for BMW, which has traded at an average 20% premium over the past three years. Without concrete signs of greater efficiency, Volkswagen could struggle to accelerate from here.\n\nWrite to Thao Hua at thao.hua@wsj.com", "MyNews24 is a user-generated section of News24.com. The stories here come from users.\n\n\"Men who are their own masters are masters of nothing else\" Oswald Chambers\n\nBefore settling in for the evening to further a manuscript on the simplicity of God's ancient (and enduring!) message to mankind, I noticed that an article relating to atheism was one of the most commented on for the day. It just so happened that earlier this weekend, while contemplating what theme to cover next in the manuscript, Divine intervention pointed towards 'Redemption and the nature of Man'.\n\nAs a scientist and researcher, driven by the need for empirical evidence and proof, I have limitless empathy and understanding for people who subscribe to a viewpoint that there is no God. By God I mean the God with a thousand names, the One God (the Creator, the Merciful, the Sovereign source of Love, the Father, Almighty, Jehovah, Allah, Christ, etc).\n\nGod is not an institution. Having been raised in an ultra-conservative, protestant Christian community, and being the only (outwardly) gay son of a former church leader, one of my earliest observations on institutionalised religion was that the moment the BMW exited the church grounds on a Sunday morning, everything 'Christian' was left behind, and in its place came (often Biblically-justified) family abuse, adultery, greed, pride and an endless pursuit of self-gratification.\n\nAlthough there seemed to have been a lot of talk of God, unconditional Love, grace, forgiveness and service to others on a Sunday, no action followed during the week. The mystical and altogether, metaphysical nature of God was seldom, if ever, shared with the congregation and generally had no presence in the church.\n\nGod is Love. A purely literal, historical, or philosophical study of the Bible, the Holy Qur'an, or any of the other ancient Holy scriptures, will not in itself provide anyone (irrespective of religious foundation) with an adequate or true Understanding of the Omnipotent, Sovereign and Divine Grace of the God of Love.\n\nThe simplicity of the message that God is Love, Mercy, Grace and Forgiveness, is easily lost amid the 'noise' often associated with ancient Holy Scriptures. Modern mankind tends to overlook the reality that God has been around well before the advent of writing, before Abraham, before Mohammed and before Jesus. It was only when God instructed Moses to capture in writing, the basic principles of life, that the Truth became word.\n\nThe Holy Scriptures that followed merely served as Divinely inspired confirmations and reminders of God's timeless message. Mankind tend to over-analyse the Holy Scriptures instead of recognising the common theme within. We confuse and complicate an otherwise simple message - that God is Love, and the One true source of Love, Kindness, Mercy and Forgiveness.\n\nTo then expect the 'non-believer' or atheist to gain any understanding of God - based on religious and dogmatic snippets - is futile. Hence the Knowledge that it is pointless for the Believer to engage in debate with the non-believer for they will not understand it - convincing the 'non-believer' is God's Sovereign domain.\n\nThe canonical Bible. Although containing the Truth, the Bible explores it from a range of often highly edited, historically, politically and place-specific perspectives. The Old and New Testament combined, literally covers most of the history of time, and creation, as we know it. But, herein also lays the wonder - the metaphysical work of the God of Love echoes throughout the ages. The same Truth is repeated time and time again through the living messages of Prophets such as Joseph, Daniel, Esther, Moses, Elijah, David and Mohammad, to name a few. Likewise, the New Testament teachings of Jesus Christ, Paul of Tarsus, and many of those that followed, are no different - unconditional surrender to the One God of Love.\n\nThe nature of man. God created mankind in Its image (male/female), and gave form to it by taking matter from the earth, and breathing Its life into that matter. Therefore, in addition to being 'a creature of the earth', mankind carries within it the potential to 'evolve' to a state of Spiritual awareness. This Divine potential is what separates humans from animals, and is imbedded in all of us, much like a Spiritual homing beacon.\n\nMost of us recognise this Divine potential as love. In order to gain a better understanding of God, and our own Spiritual potential, it is useful to first reflect on the nature of love. Most of us have loved before, and just as we are unable to 'capture' or 'confine' and measure of love in a material, physical, or tactile manner; neither can the Sovereign Source of Love (God for purposes of this reflection) be captured or rationalised in manmade terms.\n\nMankind's Divine purpose, in realising its full Divine potential, is to become both earth and Spiritual creature. To be and not to be.\n\nBecoming one with God. Unlocking our own Divine potential begins the moment we open ourselves to the possibility that, maybe, just maybe, there is more to life than what meets the eye, and that perhaps we are not in control. This 'exploration' is a deeply personal, and sacred experience between God and us. No man or man-made rule or law has standing here.\n\nAny understanding of God requires silent reflection and contemplation, the ability to step outside ourselves, and the willingness to set aside our preconditioned 'human' perceptions of the world - we need to 'get out of monkey-mode'. Becoming one with God occurs when we surrender unconditionally to God, by consciously devoting all our motivations and actions to be inspired by Love, and by extending that Love to those around us.\n\nThe good news is that we don't choose God, God chooses us. Personally, it took the better part of 40 years (and a significant amount of tragedy) to gain some understanding of God. In many respects, God had to break my will, and force submission, before unconditional surrender came.\n\nThe best advice for those who have given up believing in God, is for you to have your argument with that invisible thing in which you don't believe. No manmade argument will ever be enough. In the meantime, let your every action be guided by Love, and a commitment to loving mankind as you would have yourself.", "3 CONNECT 1 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMIDDLETOWN - A defendant in an interstate biodiesel scam has agreed to forfeit a Picasso, a Renoir, a Leroy Nieman, a Miro, five Salvador Dalis and other art work to the federal government.\n\nWhen he pleaded guilty on April 11, Joseph Furando, 49, Bergen County, N.J., also agreed to give up other property that was the subject of a restraining order after his indictment, including 19 diamond, sapphire, ruby, emerald and gold pieces of jewelry, two Rolex watches, two ultra-luxury Patek Philippe watches, a 7,447-square-feet home worth $3.5 million, a Schimmel grand piano, two Orange County Choppers custom motorcycles, a BMW and other property.\n\nFurando has admitted that he conspired with the owners/operators of a biodiesel production facility in the northwestern Henry County community of Middletown, south of Daleville, in a renewable fuels fraud scheme.\n\n\"We (also) were able to secure forfeiture agreements for approximately $100 million (in cash) but most of the money in the (bank) accounts is already gone,\" said Tim Horty, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Indianapolis. \"So we only have a few million in hand.\"\n\nFurando signed a plea agreement acknowledging that all of the property and funds to be forfeited constituted proceeds of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty.\n\nHorty said co-defendant Chad Ducey was scheduled to plead guilty on Tuesday in federal court in Indianapolis. Ducey's brothers, Chris and Craig, already pleaded guilty, as did three others.\n\nThe charges against the defendants included conspiracy, Clean Air Act false statements, wire fraud, false statements to federal investigators, and engaging in prohibited financial transactions with criminal proceeds.\n\nThe brothers owned and/or operated the Middletown-based e-biofuels plant, which produced biodiesel, a renewable fuel, from animal fats and vegetable oils.\n\nHowever, between the fall of 2009 and the summer of 2011, the production equipment was hardly used at all, according to the indictment.\n\nInstead, e-biofuels purchased biodiesel from Furando and sold the product as its own. Though the biodiesel already had been used for federal tax credits and for a federal program that requires fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels, the co-conspirators sold it as though it remained eligible for the program and tax credits.\n\nThe scheme added more than $55 million in fraudulent value to about 35 million gallons of biodiesel and cost taxpayers millions of dollars in fraudulent tax credits, prosecutors say.\n\nOther forfeited art work included a Gumbo-Carlos Comesanas, a George Braque, several Katia Pissaros and an Itzchak Tarkey, along with two rugs.\n\nContact Seth Slabaugh at (765) 213-5834.\n\n3 CONNECT 1 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1zla0J8", "Prepare to feel very old indeed.\n\nThe 90s and early 00s was easily the best time for TV ever.

For example, BMW's next-generation iDrive human-machine interface includes gesture control functions to supplement the traditional iDrive knob in the central console and voice recognition offered in the current system.\n\nConsumers' perceptions of what their vehicle is will also change, from simple transportation to a mobility platform that resembles more of a moving office space or even a gaming platform while you're in transit.\n\n\"Our interface or connection with the car will change. You'll no longer have to spend the duration of the drive focused on the road,\" said Lux Research analyst and lead study author Maryanna Saenko. \"The driver will inherently be more distracted by what's going on around them in the car, so how do you interface with the car?\"\n\nAs vehicles take over more of the driving responsibility, they'll also have to monitor the actions of drivers and passengers more closely, to ensure they're able to react if road conditions change.\n\nFor example, inward-facing cameras and biosensors located in seats or steering wheel will be able to determine if occupants are paying attention to the road around them, or reading emails or participating in a Skype meeting.\n\n\"Are they holding the steering wheel? And it not, the car will try to alert them. If it can't, it may pull over to the side of the road,\" Saenko said.\n\nHaptic technology, which creates the illusion of touch by applying vibrations, resistance or other forces, will allow vehicles to communicate with drivers like some video game controllers can today. For example, if traffic becomes congested or roadwork appear ahead, the vehicle's steering wheel may vibrate.\n\n\"A lot of driver safety features will focused around [the vehicle] paying attention to the environment around it and then notifying the driver if something is happening,\" Saenko said.\n\nSensors placed in seat fabric may also be able to alert first responders to some vital signs before they reach the scene of an accident.\n\nFully autonomous vehicles, however, won't arrive by 2030, hampered mostly by regulations and a current lack of prototypes, Saenko said.\n\nPartial autonomy features -- like self-driving on the highway -- will be slow to roll out over the next 10 years, before growing to a $22.7 billion market by 2030.\n\nExpect that sticker price to change too\n\n\"ADAS technologies open the automotive market opportunity to new players from the software and hardware worlds, with each aiming to create as much value as possible by consolidating capabilities and offering platforms that enable 'plug-and-play' autonomy,\" Saenko said.\n\nAutomation will also add to the base price of vehicles. Enhanced driver-assist features will add $527 to the price of new cars in 2020. Gradually, though, economies of scale will come into play and by 2030 the enhanced features will add $481 per car. The bulk of the additional cost arises from software -- $367 in 2020, and $220 per car in 2030 -- while connectivity will account for $160 per car in 2020 and $261 in 2030, according to Lux Research.\n\nAccording to the Lux Research report, internal and external vehicle sensors will account for 23% of the $102 billion ADAS market, while the connectivity and apps segment takes a higher 28% share; software to coordinate sensor interoperability and enable critical safety operations will claim a 25% share.\n\nEnhanced driver assist has the best opportunity to succeed. Cars with basic driver-assist features, like parking assist, will cash in early, with a potential $29.6 billion market by 2022. However, enhanced driver-assist features -- such as adaptive cruise control and lane merge -- offer the largest opportunity to automakers and tier-one manufacturers and will be worth $73 billion in 2030.\n\nLIDAR, which stands for Light Detection And Ranging, is a geospatial recognition function that's already being piloted in vehicles from BMW, Mercedes and even Google. LIDAR uses a spinning laser to paint a high-resolution 3D image of the area immediate around the car to aid the vehicle's internal computer in automated driving.\n\nWhile most automakers have LIDAR on their list of hopeful features, it's currently too expensive for mass market use, with a price tag of around $75,000. Automakers are hoping mass production will eventually drive prices down.\n\n\"LIDAR is sufficiently important enough that the prospects of the costs coming down seem viable at this point,\" Saenko said.", "Pretoria - He used a stone door-stopper to hit a man over the head to be able to steal his car, a 19-year-old told the high court on Tuesday.\n\nThe victim, of Les Marais, north of Pretoria, had invited Ben Strydom and his friend, Dean Vermeulen, for coffee.\n\nOn Tuesday, Strydom took the stand to testify against Vermeulen, in the latter's murder and robbery trial.\n\nLast year Strydom was sentenced to a total of 30 years imprisonment, of which he has to serve an effective 15, after he pleaded guilty to murdering 51-year-old Francois le Grange.\n\nVermeulen pleaded not guilty to the murder, saying the plan was simply to rob Le Grange. Through his lawyer, he said he was reluctant to go to Le Grange's home on May 19, 2013, as he had never met the man.\n\nStrydom, however, talked him into going to the house with him and to stick to the plan of robbing the older man of his luxury BMW.\n\nDuring his trial last year, Strydom said he and Vermeulen were homeless and needed money as they were hungry.\n\nAccording to him, they went to the Wonderboom Junxion Mall, north of Pretoria, on the morning of the incident, where they bought dagga. They then parked across the road from Le Grange's home, together with a friend, Jaco Lourens, while smoking dagga and making plans on how to rob Le Grange.\n\nStrydom said his plan was that Vermeulen would go along to the house and while he (Strydom) made coffee in the kitchen, Vermeulen would pick a fight with Le Grange.\n\nStrydom would then punch Le Grange until he was unconscious, after which they would take his car and sell it.\n\nStrydom said when they arrived at the house, he left the two men in the lounge as planned and went to make coffee. His eye fell on a stone door-stopper while in the kitchen, picked it up and placed it in his pocket.\n\nAccording to Strydom, an argument ensued, but he could not remember about what. \"I punched (Le Grange) with my fists and then bashed him in the face and head with the door-stopper. I cannot remember how many times, but I think it was about eight times.\"\n\nStrydom said the man fell to the ground bleeding. They left Le Grange in his home and fled with his car, which they sold for R6 000 later that day.\n\nStrydom told the court last year that he was upset with Le Grange as he had got into bed with him the previous night, when he (Strydom) stayed over.\n\nVermeulen, through his lawyer, said he had no idea Strydom was going to attack the man, let alone kill him.", "What is it ?\n\nThe BMW 1 series with a facelift, one of the most popular hatchbacks in the country.\n\nWhat is it important?\n\nIt is now one of BMW's best selling cars, vying for the top spot with the 3 series. It is a fierce competitor in the compact segment and sells surprisingly well to women as well as men.\n\nWill it look good in the driveway?\n\nIts looks have been one of this car's best selling points. It is smooth and sleek, yet offers the excitement of the hot hatch and fortunately for all of us, BMW have decided not to tinker too much with this, whew!\n\nWhat about inside ?\n\nWell finished and elegant with nice touches like high gloss black and brushed aluminium in Sports Trim, the M135i has lovely contrasting red stitching on the black leather. BMW have rationalised the trim line to make it easier for us and there are now only three, SE, Sport and MSport.\n\nAnd the sound and information system?\n\nPhew! Sat nav is now coming as standard across all models in the BMW range from the entry level 1 series upwards and you get a free map update for three years. The Connected Drive just got a whole lot bigger and now offers all sorts of services from finding you a hotel to offering apps only for as long as you want and need them. There is an SOS service, help with train times and the possibility of accessing 25 million songs in the music library.\n\nWhat about under the bonnet?\n\nFour petrol and five diesel engines. Two to single out are the 116d ED - efficient dynamics - which gives you 83.1 mpg and 89g CO2 in a 1.5 litre engine and still packs a punch, and the M 135i which is the nearest you will get to the M3 but at half the price.\n\nSafety?\n\nNew systems include an updated version of the Parking Assistant which helps bay and parallel park, active Cruise Control, high beam assist, lane departure warning and collision warning.\n\nAnything else I should know?\n\nGreat residual values when you come to sell this car or trade it in - one of its ongoing strengths. In its first year BMW expects to sell 30,000 of these cars.\n\nWhen can I get one and for how much?\n\nNow, right away.

But while many of the innovations have become common in Europe and Asia, they have been slower to arrive in the United States.\n\nThe changes are made possible primarily through the increased use of LED lamps, the same technology used in the newest generation of home lighting. LED lamps are smaller, run cooler and use less energy than standard automotive lamps.\n\n\"LEDs let us package light in smaller spaces, so we can create a signature look,\" said Shannen Borngesser, an exterior lighting engineer for General Motors. Headlights and taillights can now be constructed in different shapes and patterns that, much like a car's tail fins in the 1960s, immediately identify a particular make and model.\n\nEven to the untrained eye, there is no mistaking the front of an Audi with its sharply angled LED daytime lights, the four circles of a BMW's headlight system or the vertical red strip of a Cadillac Escalade's rear lights and white blades of its headlights.\n\nBehind the scenes, and mostly in other countries, manufacturers are developing new ways to use light to make nighttime driving safer. By combining LED lamps with cameras, a vehicle's headlights can be more than just a set of low and high beams, and instead continuously alter their light patterns to exactly fit the immediate road conditions.\n\nAn early version of this system has been offered by Opel, G.M.'s European division, in several models for 12 years. Its current version, AFL Plus (for \"adaptive forward lighting plus\") determines the condition of the road and, using a rotating drum inside a xenon headlamp, creates nine variations of the beam pattern.\n\nBut it's the increased use of LED lamps that is allowing manufacturers to fine-tune this technology. Given an LED's smaller size, cars can pack more bulbs into each headlight, each of which can then be turned on and off to create unique light patterns based on road conditions and the amount of oncoming traffic. This ensures that other drivers are never blinded by oncoming headlights, while the driver of the vehicle using the system receives an optimal view of the road.\n\nOpel's AFL Plus system using LEDs will be introduced this summer; it will be able to create 256 beam patterns, said Ingolf Schneider, Opel's director of lighting technology.\n\nAudi, the luxury division of Volkswagen, has been a leader in lighting technology. Its high-performance R8 includes an optional laser high beam. And five of its sedan and sport utility vehicle models can be bought with an LED-based high-beam matrix headlight.\n\nThe system is so good at not shining light on vehicles traveling ahead of it that the high beam can remain on and adjust itself, even if eight cars are in front.\n\nBut American drivers have yet to see the benefits of the new technology. When those cars are sold in the United States, all those models are fitted with standard headlights.\n\nRegulations in the United States specify that headlights must create a specific pattern. While they can rotate when a car turns a corner, the pattern is not allowed to change shape.\n\nBecause of restrictions like these, \"lighting advances are coming from Europe and Japan,\" said Stephan Berlitz, Audi's head of lighting technology.\n\nWhile Chrysler doesn't offer vehicles with LED headlights, it is interested in creating a matrix high-beam system similar to Audi's.\n\n\"The industry is very excited by the adaptive driving beam,\" said Dennis Novack, the development lead for exterior lighting for Fiat Chrysler.\n\nManufacturers see other technologies eventually creating even more efficient, attractive and safe lighting. Opel is in the early stages of testing headlights that will respond to a driver's eye movements, which are tracked by an in-vehicle camera. Algorithms and exterior cameras will ensure that a beam's pattern and direction do not change every time drivers look at billboards or their feet. The system won't be available for at least five years, Ms. Borngesser said.\n\nAudi conceives of a time when headlights will be able to project patterns, like a foot path on the road to help a pedestrian cross a dark street, or lines to the left and right of a vehicle as it passes through a construction zone, allowing the driver to get a better sense of the size of the constricted road, Mr. Berlitz said.\n\nAnd while LED lamps have migrated to a vehicle's rear, creating bright sheets of brake lights, turn signals and taillights that illuminate almost instantaneously, car manufacturers and designers are entranced by the possibilities of OLED, or organic light emitting diode, technology.\n\nOLED light can be manufactured in thin sheets, giving designers the ability to place light wherever on the car's body they desire. And because OLED light sources take up so little room, vehicle space could be freed up for other uses or to create other shapes.\n\nStill, the use of OLED light sources is years off, because the technology is stymied by current low light output and high cost.\n\nTo encourage the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to change its rules regarding matrix high beams, the Society of Automotive Engineers has been working for over a year to create a set of standards that the government agency could then use as a basis for rule-making changes. Last year, Audi brought a European version of its A8 sedan to the United States to demonstrate its technology to government officials.\n\nBut approval, if it happens, will most likely take years, officials say, because changing American lighting regulations is an elaborate and slow process involving testing, public comments and rule making. Once approved, manufacturers then have to fit the changes into their production schedules.\n\n\"We're looking at ways to amend the lighting standard to allow systems to provide even better lighting,\" said Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for the agency. \"It's a frustrating and time-consuming process. We have an obligation that the U.S. government not act rashly.\"", "The final list of cars for Project Cars has been revealed by Bandai Namco.\n\nFeaturing a variety of different types of vehicles, the list was put together to represent global car culture and motorsport that caters toward the community.\n\nThe cars that will be available in the upcoming racing game are as follows:\n\nPROJECT CARS STANDARD EDITION\n\nAlpine A450\n\nAriel Atom 300 Supercharged\n\nAriel Atom 500 V8\n\nAston Martin Rapide S Hydrogen Hybrid\n\nAston Martin Vantage GT3\n\nAston Martin Vantage GT4\n\nAudi R18 TDI LMP1\n\nAudi R8 LMS Ultra\n\nAudi R8 V10 Plus\n\nBAC Mono\n\nBMW 1 M Coup\u00c8 (E82)\n\nBMW 320 Turbo Gr.5 (E21)\n\nBMW M3 Gr.A (E30)\n\nBMW M3 GT (E92)\n\nBMW M3 GT4 (E92)\n\nBMW Z4 GT3\n\nCaper Monterey Stockcar\n\nCaterham Seven Classic\n\nCaterham Superlight R500\n\nCaterham SP/300R\n\nFord Capri Zakspeed Gr.5\n\nFord Escort RS1600\n\nFord Focus RS\n\nFord Mustang Boss 302R1\n\nFord Mustang Cobra SCCA TransAm\n\nFord Sierra RS500 Cosworth Gr.A\n\nFormula Gulf 1000\n\nGinetta G40 Junior\n\nGinetta G55 GT3\n\nGinetta G55 GT4\n\nGumpert Apollo S\n\nLotus 49 Cosworth\n\nLotus 72D Cosworth\n\nLotus 78 Cosworth\n\nLotus 98T Renault\n\nMarek RP219D LMP2\n\nMarek RP339h (PM 06a) LMP1\n\nMcLaren 12C\n\nMcLaren 12C GT3\n\nMcLaren P1\n\nMercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evo2 DTM\n\nMercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.8 AMG\n\nMercedes-Benz A45 AMG\n\nMercedes-Benz SLS AMG\n\nMercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT\n\nMitsubishi Lancer Evo X FQ400\n\nOreca 03 Nissan\n\nPagani Huayra\n\nPagani Zonda R\n\nPalmer Jaguar JP-LM\n\nRadical SR3 RS\n\nRadical SR8 RX\n\nRenault Clio Cup\n\nRenault M\u00c8gane R.S. 265\n\nRuf CTR3\n\nRuf RGT-8\n\nRuf RGT-8 GT3\n\nRWD P20 LMP2\n\nRWD P30 LMP1\n\nSMS Formula A\n\nSMS Formula B\n\nSMS Formula C\n\nSMS Formula Rookie\n\nSMS Kart 125cc (Kart01)\n\nSMS Superkart 250cc (Kart02)\n\nLIMITED EDITION CAR PACK\n\nSauber C9 Mercedes\n\nMercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe DTM\n\nMcLaren F1\n\nFord Mk.

Be sure to subscribe!", "A battery is not like a gas tank. Given today's tank sizes and ubiquitous gas stations, gas-powered cars are rarely sold on their ability to travel X number of miles (it does happen). But when it comes to electric vehicles, the all-electric range number remains all-important. Forget the fact that most people in the US drive around 35-40 miles and even the cheapest EV available here has 62 miles of range, there's a lot of focus on how far you can go in a battery-powered car.\n\nWith that in mind, we were curious to see how much it actually costs to get your EV miles. There's a lot of talk about the ever-decreasing cost-per-kWh of battery capacity, and the lower you can get the pack, the lower you can price the car, but for today's experiment, we're more interested in the whole cost of the car. From the tires to the li-ion cells to the windshield wipers, how much will you pay for each electric mile in your plug-in car? Like any sane person, we built a spreadsheet. That's what sane people do, right?\n\nBefore we delve into the results, a few notes. These are all of the 2015 model year vehicles in the EPA database and the prices are the base MSRP without destination fees or taxes or any government incentives. This is a straight-up simple MSRP comparison with official EPA numbers thrown in, because that's a fair place to start. Also, the useable portion of the battery in one of today's EVs is never equal to the full kWh rating. But, since automakers can be cagey about letting the public know how much of the pack equals a \"full charge,\" the best we can do is compared the overall sizes to each other.\n\nNow, since we were curious about the cost per EV mile number (MSRP divided by official range), what's striking is how the two higher-end models bookend the list. The Tesla Model S comes in at the low end, costing just $312.50 for each of its 240 electric miles while the BMW i3 costs $523.46 for one or its 81 miles of range. While we can sort of understand that Tesla is able to hide some of its battery cost in the luxuriousness of the Model S (and its $75,000 price tag), BMW has a harder time doing that, perhaps because of the cost of the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic frame hiding under the i3.\n\nAfter a lot of volatility in EV costs over the years (most of the long-termers have seen some sort of price drop), the cost of a mile of EV range has settled down a bit. The average cost of a mile of EV range across these 11 vehicles is $384.36. That's down from an average price of $414.44 before all of the price drops figured in, a decrease of $30.08 or a 7.25 percent drop. This is certainly moving in right direction, but the real problem is that so few of these cars are available in all 50 states.\n\nWe've put all of these EVs and their cost-per-electric-mile rating into a gallery full of pretty pictures, so go ahead and click to see more.", "1970 Lancia (Bertone) Stratos HF Zero, loaned by XJ Wang Collection, Thursday April 30th, 2015.

What the show -- which opens Sunday -- is about, really, is the imagination. It's about impossible visions and personal fantasies. It's about dreams that, by some miracle, tunneled their way into the real world.\n\nWhat \"Dream Cars\" really is is a story of American exceptionalism and European sophistication. It's a story of the intersection between art and engineering. It's a story of how mere cars, progeny of the horse-drawn carriage and the bulky, utilitarian Ford Model T, became not only moving sculptures but also time machines, capable of preserving the ideals of their era while barreling forth into the future.\n\nThe story begins with the hunky roadsters by Ford and General Motors in the mid-1930s and ends with a 2010 Porsche concept and the platinum, lizardlike 2001 experiment by BMW's Christopher Bangle, which featured a Spandex \"skin\" that allows the car to wink and open its hood from the center like a gaping mouth. \"Dream Cars\" captures both the prescient -- an electric Smart car designed in 1942 -- and the nostalgic -- sports cars glittering with timeless machismo.\n\nWhat more could be said of these metal beasts? The raisons d'etre of such gems as the 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolt -- whose owner, Roger Willbanks, first encountered as a 5-year-old while perched atop his older brother's shoulder at a dealership in Denver -- is to be seen, not to be read or chatted about. There is no equivalent to witnessing the 1970 Lancia (Bertone) Stratos HF Zero as it opens itself up like an eagle stretching its wings.\n\nThe 1934 Edsel Ford Speedster is part of the \"Dream Cars\" exhibition that opens May 3 at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. David Lindquist / The Indianapolis Star\n\nThis is far from the first time vehicles were treated as art. Cars have figured prominently in museums since the Museum of Modern Art exhibited \"8 Automobiles\" in 1951. \"Dream Cars\" drew praise and record visitors when it premiered at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in 2014.\n\n\"When you go to a museum and look at a suit of armor, a vase or a piece of furniture, these are ostensibly practical objects that were beautifully designed and are on display for people to admire them,\" says Ken Gross, celebrated car writer and \"Dream Cars\" guest curator. \"So why not a car?\"\n\nHere, in chronological order, are the five cars you need to see (information courtesy of \"Dream Cars: Innovative Design, Visionary Ideas\" by Sarah Schleuning and Ken Gross\"):\n\nEdsel Ford Model 40 Special Speedster, 1934\n\nDesigned by Edsel Ford and Eugene T. \"Bob\" Gregorie.\n\n75 bhp Model 40 flathead V-8 engine, alligator-style hood with louvered side panels, low-mounted faired-in headlights, cycle wings covering Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels.\n\nBig, bold and bulletlike, the Model 40 Special Speedster is a portal between the boxy styles of the past and the increasingly-aerodynamic shapes of the 1940s and on. With unprecedented long and low proportions, it inspired the 1935 Miller-Ford Indianapolis 500 two-man race cars.\n\nNorman Timbs Special, 1947\n\nDesigned by Norman Timbs.\n\n1947 Buick straight-8 engine fitted with factory-optional dual carburetors, fully skirted fadeaway fenders, close coupled cockpit without doors, raked and split windshield.\n\nThis is the brainchild of the same man behind the Blue Crown Spark Plug Specials that won the Indianapolis 500 in 1947, 1948 and 1949. A sleek, radical maroon beauty with an aluminum tail that opens hydraulically from behind, like a clamshell.\n\nGeneral Motors Firebird I XP-21, 1953\n\nDesigned by Harley J. Earl, Robert F. \"Bob\" McLean, and General Motors styling section staff.\n\n200 mph top speed, 2,500 pounds, turbine engine, experimental jet car design.\n\nThe Firebird has wings specially angled so that it won't take off at higher speeds. The first gas turbine-powered American car ever built and tested, this wingless jet plane exemplifies its era's ardor for concept cars and \"flying\" cars. Although it spawned the Firebird II and Firebird III, General Motors eventually abandoned the idea of a turbine-powered car due to technical impracticalities.\n\nChrysler (Ghia) Streamline X \"Gilda,\" 1955\n\nDesigned by Giovanni Savonuzzi and Virgil Exner.\n\n\"Shaped by the wind\" wingless jet aircraft design. First conceived with 1,500-cc OSCA four-cylinder gasoline engine, 140 mph top speed. Later outfitted with gas turbine power plant, producing a characteristic shrill jet engine whine.\n\nThe zeal of the Postwar era for automotive design ushered in sleek, metallic concepts inspired by jet aircraft. The \"Gilda\" -- named after 1946 film noir starring Rita Hayworth, who was described by Savonuzzi's daughter, Alberta, as a \"super-sexy bomb\" -- is a rocket on the road with a low-hanging style that influenced Chrysler's 1957 \"Forward Look\" line.\n\nBMW GINA Light Visionary Model, 2001\n\nDesigned by Christopher Bangle.\n\nWater resistant, translucent textile body with seamless polyurethane-coated Spandex fabric exterior, deployable rear spoiler, moveable rocker panels.\n\nWith a skin that molds to its changing shape, the GINA challenged the notion that cars have to be made of metal. Designed to push BMW's design forward and explore a potentially superior production process, the car was ultimately deemed unpractical for safety reasons, though its design inspired BMW's future roadsters.\n\nCall Star reporter Wei-Huan Chen at (317) 444-6249.

Oliver on a single charge of conspiring to distribute heroin.\n\nThe new indictment adds gun and drug possession charges against both men and adds a money laundering charge against Montgomery. It also adds two new defendants \u00e2\u0080\" Charles Cook, 48, of East Hills and Andre Avent, 37, of Homestead \u00e2\u0080\" who are charged with money laundering.\n\nLawyers for the four men either couldn't be reached or declined comment.\n\nA June 8 search of Montgomery's home turned up 1,500 bricks of heroin and 16 firearms. Each brick represents 50 stamp bags of heroin and the street value of a stamp bag is typically placed at about $20, giving the seizure a street value of about $1.5 million.\n\nA federal grand jury on April 14 charged Montgomery and Perrin with possession of more than a kilogram of heroin, possession of firearms by convicted felons and possession of firearms in furtherance of drug crimes.\n\nThe grand jury charged Montgomery, Cook and Avent with using drug proceeds to enter into lease-purchase agreements on Montgomery's Mt. Washington home and another house in Ross as well as the purchase of an Audi Q5 and a BMW 750Lxi.\n\nThe government is seeking the forfeiture of the two cars, about $24,000 in cash, about 10 pieces of diamond-studded jewelry and Rolex and Breitling watches and a bar of silver, according to court documents.", "Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric car specialist, was trading about 1.75% lower, in the US$228/share ahead of an announcement by the group, scheduled at 8 pm (San Francisco time).\n\nElon Musk will deliver a highly anticipated announcement, after markets close, which many investors and pundits have speculated to be about the launch of a battery to power houses. Indeed, it could be an announcement that could launch a new era worthy of the futuristic utopia of the' Jetsons', perhaps one that will mark the true start of the 21st century in cultural terms.\n\nIndeed, in February, Elon Musk boasted that Tesla Motors would realize that no car manufacturer had never done, reaching a market capitalization of US$700 billion in 2025, more than the value of automotive giants such as Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, Toyota and Honda, the sum of whose market values is no more than US$522 billion.\n\nEither Elon Musk is delusional or he has a secret strategy. In fact, the strategy is not very cryptic; in order to achieve ambitious market targets, Tesla will have to step beyond the automotive sector. Musk, likes to say that he wants to \"change the world\". He has already changed the automotive world.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a Mercedes Benz, BMW or Cadillac driver taking the impact of an electric powered luxury sedan seriously. Yet, the Tesla Model S is on sale and working as promised.\n\nThe company plans to upgrade its software across the entire Model S range, including those it sold two years ago, allowing partial driverless functions on the highway. The 2013 Model S will take you from Silicon Valley to LA without a driver having to touch the steering wheel, the accelerator or the brake pedal - unless you decide to leave the motorway for a bite to eat or stretch your legs.\n\nThis automatic upgrade, achieved through downloadable software at Tesla dealers, is a great marketing coup. It means that just like an I-phone, which is updated to improve performance through various iterations of the IOS operating system, Tesla can upgrade your model with new features years after it is delivered from the dealership.\n\nIn 2017, Tesla will introduce its affordable model, an electric car for about 35,000 dollars - a price comparable to the 30,026 dollars paid on average for a new car at an American dealer. Many people will be able to afford a Tesla electric instead of a gasoline or hybrid car.\n\nThe challenge is enormous, but Tesla will also launch a battery capable of storing activity photovoltaic electricity for domestic and industrial uses. In 2017, the batteries will be produced in a \"mega-plant\", under construction and for which the company plans to invest US$5 billion.\n\nTesla will become the largest producer of lithium-ion batteries. And April 30 new listings should be done.\n\nThe Musk strategy is to turn Tesla from a single car manufacturer or a supplier to a revolutionary provider of self-service energy, a 'one stop shop' to eliminate consumers' dependency on utility and oil companies.\n\nTesla's batteries will use solar energy collected during the daylight hours, storing a portion of it to powers your house at night, and of course your electric car the next day, reducing in the process the need for a massive infrastructure investment to install battery charging stations.", "The car was stopped back in December 2013 when armed police and the Trident Gang Crime Command mounted a sting in Croydon in south London.\n\nEdward Ephraim, 32, was arrested at the scene but Adrian McNeish, also 32, ran away from the officers and was only captured five months later following a \"complex and protracted manhunt\", police said.\n\nMcNeish had been out of prison on licence when the BMW was stopped in 2013.\n\nEphraim, of Lennard Road, Croydon, was yesterday jailed for six years at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to two firearms offences, including possession of a gun with intent to cause fear of violence.\n\nWeapon: This is the shotgun found on the back seat of a BMW (Picture: Metropolitan Police) McNeish, of Mitford Walk, Crawley, was jailed for nine years for possession of a prohibited weapon, after denying the charge and being convicted at trial.\n\nFour other men who were arrested at the time were cleared of firearm offences.\n\nDC Darren Eyers, from Trident, said: \"Ephraim and McNeish are two dangerous individuals.\n\n\"Their intent was to threaten people's lives through the possession and no doubt use of the firearm we recovered.\"", "If you've ever seen a Rolls-Royce with a painted pinstripe down the side -- that long, thin dead-straight line that goes from the just behind the headlights to just before the taillights -- you're seeing the artwork of Mark Court.\n\nThat's his job and his alone.

Amanda Harnett.\n\nOwners of the missing property will be contacted by police.\n\nThe RCMP's auto crime team said a man snuck into a home in Coquitlam sometime on the night of April 19, stole the keys to the vehicle, opened up the garage door and drove away in the BMW.\n\nPolice spotted the SUV a few days later in New Westminster, Surrey and Burnaby and tracked it by helicopter.\n\nThe RCMP's Port Mann Freeway Patrol tried to stop the BMW in New Westminster, but the driver didn't comply. The driver sped through Burnaby, where it was involved in a minor accident.

The legislative branch of the European Union ruled that starting with 2018, all cars made and sold in the EU must be fitted with the eCall technology.\n\nIn case you didn't know, eCall is a European initiative that aims at reducing the number of casualties on its roads by helping out first responders with vital information. Basically, in case of an accident, cars fitted with this sort of devices will automatically call 911 (112 in Europe) and send information such as the number of occupants, the car type and fuel used to paramedics. This way, they are prepared to act before reaching the site of the accident.\n\nIt all sounds good, in theory, saving lives by preparing those in charge of getting us out of trouble beforehand. However, a lot of people have expressed concerns about the fact that we'd be forced to give up on our privacy by having these things installed on our cars.\n\nThis issue is the reason this law wasn't passed back in 2012 when the initiative was proposed for the first time. Back then, various voices opposed the project because the eCall system provided too much information to third party entities.\n\nNow, after being revised, the initiative passed but not without some voices still claiming that it is wrong to make things mandatory.\n\n\"Forcing drivers to have a device installed in their car, which is capable of recording and transmitting exactly where and when they are driving, is totally unacceptable,\" said Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch.\n\nBut why exactly is that? Wouldn't it be nice to have an automated system to call 911 in case you're knocked out or incapable of using the phone?\n\nIn theory, the tech is extremely useful. As a matter of fact, people will be able to use it independently, in case they spot an accident in a remote area.\n\nLet's say you're driving on a highway, in one of the countries in the EU and spot an accident. Being far away from home, chances are you won't know either the language or the exact location where it all happened. All you have to do to call help is press the eCall button in your car, and paramedics will be sent your way.\n\nHowever, the downside is that we don't know exactly who has access to all of this info. Furthermore, the GPS tracking will be on at all times, reading your driving habits and your daily trips, knowing everything you do while inside your car.\n\nSure, protesters managed to make sure the data sent over is reduced to the type of vehicle and fuel used, time of accident and location of the crash but that last bit is enough to learn all about you.\n\nNow imagine advertisers want access to your driving habits to interpret them and try and sell you stuff. They could gain access to the data and know exactly how to 'work' you in order to make you buy things without even realizing it. Can't happen?\n\nJust earlier this year a BMW official said that they have already received offers for such valuable data from a variety of companies, for big money. That was for cars using their advanced navigation system but imagine that all models built after 2018 will have GPS trackers on them. That's a big target to reach, and most marketers will find it irresistible.\n\nSure, for now car makers are 'resisting the urge to sell this data' but for how long will they be able to keep it up? What happens after that?\n\nAccording to the European Commission, that will never happen.\n\n\"We are frequently getting contacted by citizens concerned that by having eCall installed in their vehicles, their location will be continuously tracked, their driving habits monitored, and their private life infringed,\" the EC said.\n\n\"[But] there are absolutely no reasons to be worried about your privacy. Confusion should be avoided between the public Pan European 112 eCall that is proposed by the EC and other private road safety systems.\"\n\nFurthermore, it seems like the system will always be dormant, and it will be activated only when airbag sensors are triggered, otherwise no data will be recorded or shared without consent.\n\nThat sounds good in theory but how long will it take until somebody abuses it or until law enforcement decides that those GPS trackers should be used for other purposes as well?\n\nI mean, just as the European Parliament simply decided that we should all use these features, they could go ahead in the future and decided that they should be on at all times. All in the name of safety!\n\nYou see, that's the biggest problem here: not allowing people to choose. Sure, we can hide behind all sorts of pretenses and claim that it's all for the better good but in the end the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nForcing people to wear GPS trackers on their cars doesn't seem right as far as privacy is concerned. A more logical approach would've been to force manufacturers to offer the system free of charge and then let people decide how valuable their lives are.\n\nAccording to the EU, manufacturers will only spend around $100 on average, per car, to install the eCall system. That's a number that could be subsidized by the European Union, and then we could all at least have a choice in the matter.", "Cadillac officially announced 2016 Cadillac CTS-V pricing yesterday, and General Motors' fastest production vehicle will set you back a cool $83,995.

Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his government should lead by example, refusing any interaction with dirty industries.\n\nPascoe Sabido is a campaigner for Corporate Europe Observatory.\n\nThe French governerment wants 20% of the cost for organising this year's historic UN climate conferce in Paris to be financed by the private sector. Paris has estimated the total budget for the organisation of the COP21 (venues, security, communication etc) at \u20ac187 million.\n\nTo help foot the bill, dirty energy companies, lobbyists against energy transition, and some of the worst greenwashers have stepped forward. But how many massive multinational companies spend money without expecting a return on investment? None.\n\nGiving the stage to big business to present their own climate spin is further strengthening the stranglehold of major corporations over the management of yet another COP, and what form tackling climate change takes. It doesn't have to be this way.\n\nIn November 2014, the French Senate cut the public budget for the organisation of COP21. The French government then turned to the private sector to make up the shortfall. There were many reassurances to civil society groups that the same mistakes that were made in Warsaw in 2013 would not be made again.\n\nBack then, some of the biggest polluters from the oil, gas and coal industries were all able to wrap themselves in the colours of the UN - a practice known as bluewashing - and claim to be in favour of tackling climate change.\n\nWhile a full list of sponsors for COP21 was promised from French officials at the end of March, it is still not available. However, it was recently revealed that the first sponsors of the talks will be Suez Environment, a key member of the French pro-fracking lobby, and luxury brand Luis Vuitton (LVMH). Others were initially announced - BMW, Vattenfall and New Holland Agriculture - but later denied by the COP21 organisers. All have appalling climate change records.\n\nUnrepudiated sponsors of the official talks, Suez environment and LVMH similalry fail to meet the criteria that could be reasonably considered to be consistent with the fight against climate change. Suez Environment is France's second largest provider of environmental services (mainly water and waste).\n\nIn the 1990s, the company was at the forefront of a market offensive by big French water companies in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nSuez just recently won over \u20ac400 million in compensation in an investor state dispute settlement case it took against Argentinian capital Buenos Aires after the city took control of its water services in 2006.\n\nSuez Environment also did not hesitate to jump on recent privatizations in Greece and has positioned itself as a world leader in the treatment of polluted water from coal mining and shale gas. It is also among the French companies lobbying for shale gas as part of the Centre for Non-conventional Hydrocarbons. While Suez environment is not directly involved in fossil fuel extraction (unlike GDF-Suez, which owns 34% of Suez Environment), it operates as a service provider for the treatment of water polluted by these processes. In doing so, it validates activities which are extremely harmful to the environment and the climate.\n\nLVMH is not a fossil fuel producer and has no direct interest in the sector to our knowledge. However, it is a champion of tax evasion, with more than 200 subsidiaries in tax havens.\n\nThis allows the company to avoid paying their fair share towards the energy transition we need to make if we're going to tackle climate change. While it's not in the business of climate destruction, that does not make it a \"climate-friendly business\" - the term used by the French authorities for companies financing the COP21.\n\nSponsorship of the talks is only the tip of the corporate iceberg in terms of how multinationals are trying to use the next COP to promote their own solutions to climate change, for example, supposedly safer fracking, or cleaner burning of fossil fuels.\n\nUnfortunately, such false solutions will only ensure a continuation of business as usual rather than the change we need to see. These companies are part of the problem, not the solution. The organisation of such crucial negotiations on an issue of such significance should not depend on their financing.\n\nDespite its seeming inevitability, the excessive influence over and privileged accessed to political decision makers enjoyed by big business doesn't have to be tolerated. In the area of tobacco control, campaigning from civil society and Southern governments saw the introduction of a firewall between tobacco industry lobbyists and public health officials to tackle the problem.\n\nThey argued that the damage caused by industry, for example by undermining the science, lobbying against good policies, posing false solutions, creating fake citizen front-groups, sponsoring of events, employing ex-health officials and civil servants - as well as the fact that their interests will never be aligned with the public interest - merited such a separation.\n\nAnd this firewall between lobbyists and public health officials didn't just apply to the tobacco control negotiations, but at national level, for every government who signed the treaty. The fossil fuel industry falls into the same category - lobbying to undermine progress, as well as having its economic interests completely at odds with what we need to do to tackle climate change.\n\nWe need a firewall between the big polluters and our politicians. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his government should lead by example, refusing any interaction with dirty industry - COP21 sponsorship included.", "You've seen this movie before. Topple the BMW 3 Series has gone more rounds than The Fast and The Furious and The Transporter combined. But like any good cinematic retread, this time it's different.\n\nFor starters, the latest installment is a zombie flick. Born from the ashes of Ford ownership and the failed X-Type, the 2017 Jaguar XE is coming to save us from the somnambulant, undead Bimmer. Think Army of Darkness with luxury sport sedans, and you'll understand what we're going for.\n\nOkay, the plot is only based on a true story. The reality in the automotive world isn't as dramatic as most car journalists would like you to believe. But the XE is hugely important for Jaguar's desire to increase global production. You're looking at the future best-selling model. It's built on an all-new body structure that forms the basis for all the brand's upcoming sedans. The smallest, most affordable Jaguar also launches with a new engine family, built in a new factory in England.\n\nThe XE arrives stateside in early 2016 with two available engines. A 2.0-liter diesel from the new Ingenium lineup is the entry-level model. Above that is the supercharged 3.0-liter V6 familiar to the Jaguar and Land Rover lineup. A turbo 2.0-liter gas engine will come in below the diesel at a later date, with an optional manual transmission. The XE versions on launch will offer rear- or all-wheel-drive. Pricing information is yet to be revealed. Until then, just assume the XE will mimic its competitors for price and content. We spent most of our time driving the 35t with R-Sport trim, but check back for a driving impression of the diesel in a few days.\n\nAs we reported in our prototype drive of the XE earlier this year, this car has incredible steering feel. It's the supernatural aid in the XE's monomyth if any film buffs are still paying attention. The electrically assisted system ranks in the hall of fame with the rack on the current Porsche 911 Carrera. Lightly weighted, the loads build up in the steering wheel like it's wired to strain gauges on the sidewall of the front tires.\n\nIt's not just good programming that makes the XE steer so well, although that's a big part. The rest comes from the chassis. Jaguar engineers claim the double wishbone front suspension uses lessons learned from the F-Type. The rear part of the car's quick responses comes from a multi-link setup Jag calls integrated link. A body 20-percent stiffer than the current XF also contributes to sharp reflexes. Three-quarters of the structure is made of aluminum, and the dashboard crossbeam uses magnesium. Still, we expect a loaded 35t to tip the scales close to 3800 pounds, close to the BMW 335i's weight.\n\nIf the XE isn't the featherweight of its class, though, you'd never know from behind the wheel. Outputs of 340 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque have a way of hiding mass. Paired to a ZF eight-speed, the XE 35t sprints to 60 in a claimed 4.9 seconds. Less brash than the exhaust note in the F-Type, the V6 still emits a medium pitch rasp that never fails to please. Supercharger whine is barely perceptible. Most of what you hear is just the sweet sounds of combustion.\n\nDriving around Rioja, Spain's wine country and at the Circuito de Navarra, the XE's chassis and powertrain are in perfect harmony. Like other Jaguars, the ride is soft and compliant. It only hints at the car's abilities. We joked about the absurdity of driving the XE on the track - lapping sessions on press launches are as clich\u00e9 as N\u00fcrburgring times - only to find out that the baby Jaguar can handle any road course abuse. What's most impressive is the car's balance. Find the limits and you'll see that the edge is like a gentle slope. Understeer is easily managed by the fade-free brakes. Jaguar engineers are so good at ride and handling tuning, we wonder if British bedtime stories are tales of force-displacement curves and spring-damper ratios.\n\nAn aside on one other absurdity: Jaguar's naming scheme. The descriptions: 35t, 20d, 25t (the designation for the 2.0-liter gas engine) relate only slighty to horsepower, displacement, or the vague notion of \"virtual displacement\" conjured up by evil German marketing executives. In any case, this system is no less crazy than numbers on the trunk of other cars. And they line up with the equivalent competition.\n\nAnd speaking of badges, the XE sticks them on some handsome bodywork. The car shares common styling themes with the XF and XK. The goal, said designer Wayne Burgess, was to unify the brand's look across the lineup. In front, the headlights carry the \"J-blade\" swooping line with the daytime running lamps. Close up, at the border of the headlights and front fender, the styling seems unified with the 3 Series. But the overall look is genuine Jaguar. And if you weren't sure, the name is spelled out on the trunklid below the leaping cat in homage to the E-Type. The rectangular tail lamps house another familiar shape with glowing brake lights that mimic the F-Type's.\n\nInside, the swooping dash borrows from the XJ with the arc continuing through to the door panels. In the center lies Jaguar's new infotainment system, known as InControl. The good news is that this is a vast improvement from Jaguar's current touchscreen. It's responsive, easy to use, and has hard buttons that shortcut to the main functions. The bad news is that this is still a touchscreen, so it's tough to do anything but basic tasks while driving. Below InControl is the rotary shift knob, with the Jaguar Drive Control settings in a row of buttons to the rear. The system alters the steering, throttle response, transmission setting, and if equipped, adjustable dampers between four settings. Switch from Normal to Dynamic mode and the gauges change their glow from blue to red. At night the ambient lighting shifts as well.\n\nThe cabin materials are impressive, with soft leather, a stitched dash, and real metal paddle shifters on the steering wheel. There are a couple of let-downs, like cheap plastic on the top of the steering column and a chintzy feel to the multifunction buttons on the wheel. Still, Jaguar did well to make this a first-class cabin. It doesn't top the materials in the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but then again the C-Class doesn't drive as well as the XE.\n\nDoes the XE have what it takes to put the BMW out of its misery? With sales in the US almost a year away, we've only seen a preview of the XE-versus-the-world feature. But spoiler alert: we're pretty sure the good guy wins this one.", "Pre-owned luxury car market gain traction among Indian users\n\nLuxury car brand BMW may have fallen behind its two German peers, Audi and Mercedes, in sales volumes, but the company's chief executive in India says he is not losing sleep over it as he is not interested in playing the market leadership game.\n\n\"We are focusing on models that can deliver better profit,\" Philipp von Sahr, president, BMW Group India, says.\n\nSahr is walking the talk on moving away from \"short-termisms like monthly sales figures\".

While Audi reported eight per cent growth in sales and Mercedes reported 13 per cent growth, BMW reported a seven per cent drop in sales.\n\nSahr doesn't mind taking a dig at his competitors. \"One of our competitors has reported half his sales from small cars. I doubt he is very profitable,\" says Sahr. BMW has decided to stay away from small cars and focus on more high-end sedans and sports utility vehicles. The company launched i8 hybrid electric super car at Rs 2.29 crore and is planning 15 car launches this year in India.\n\nThese includes four models under the 'M' brand, which is expected to be priced above Rs 1 crore, as against both Mercedes and Audi's recently launched sedans which are priced at around Rs 30 lakh.\n\nThe company will have four new products, five face lifts and the rest are model updates. The company's focus will mainly be on 3 and 5 series and core models including X5, which are more profitable. The BMW Group introduced MINI as a premium small car brand in India in 2012.

One was launched in Vijaywada (Andhra Pradesh), Hutch (Gujarat) and Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). In terms of sales growth, BMW will grow in mega cities, but dealership-wise, the growth will be more in tier II and III cities.\n\nSahr says these are the markets that have tremendous growth potential and the company is focused on the rich and young upcoming entrepreneurs. There is a large number of people who are rich but still don't drive premium cars and spend money on marriage, education, jewellery or real estate. \"That's the segment we are going to tap in a big way\", he says.\n\nAbhay Dange, director, Press and corporate affairs, says unlike its competitors who seem obsessed with Bollywood, BMW has four major brand building activities including BMW India Bridal Fashion Week, BMW experience stores for potential customers, association with golf and cultural events.\n\nThe group's activities in India also include marketing of motorcycles, as well as financial services for its premium clientele. The company has increased its investment from Rs 390 crore to Rs 490 crore in India.\n\nThe BMW plant in Chennai started operations in March 2007 with eight models. The current capacity of the plant is 14,000 units a year, which Sahr says, is enough to cater to the current demand. In any case, to reach optimum capacity utilisation, the company needs a volume of around 30,000 units a year, which is a long journey.\n\nLocalisation level of the cars is currently at around 50 per cent, compared to 20 per cent earlier, which helps the company to produce more efficiently and reduce complexity and cost.

Just about the only surviving product from Reithofer's reign is a third Project i vehicle, which will likely be badged i5.The BMW i5 has been many things before becoming what it is now. First a long-wheelbase version of the i3, the i5 turned into a fuel-cell showcase before reappearing as an i3/i8 crossbreed. The i3 is not exactly profitable, the i8 is a high-end niche vehicle, and the i5 aims to split the difference by being a highly efficient but not astronomically expensive four-seat, four-door notchback. The i5, which we expect will be green-lighted in October, fuses bits of the i3 and i8 with a more basic vehicle architecture that's cheaper to build. The BMW i5 extensively uses upcoming modular CLAR (new rear-wheel-drive architecture) componentry as well as carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase structural rigidity. In proposals, the i5's design featured a choice of three attention-grabbing door treatments, all without a B-pillar, but to keep overall costs at a manageable level, the scissor/gullwing/suicide doors were dropped and the B-pillars were reinstated.The BMW i5 will look like a normal three-box car, not a crowd-stopping spaceship like its siblings. Why? Because customers in key markets such as China and the United States prefer sedans to any other body style. The i5 is about as long as the short-but-stout i8, and yet it aims to be roomier than a 3 Series by using the longest possible wheelbase and the shortest possible front overhang. There should be enough space for a family-size luggage compartment because, like the i3 and i8, the i5 stows its main electric motor between the driven rear wheels. Propulsion can either be purely electric or come in the form of a plug-in hybrid. (A fuel-cell option co-developed with Toyota has been pushed back to 2020 and beyond.) The EV has a 225-hp rear motor that works in tandem with a second 135-hp motor up front. Its targeted 250 miles of range suggests a battery capacity of more than 75 kilowatt-hours. The more potent motor in the plug-in is good for about 275 hp, and a combustion engine will drive the front wheels. At present, a war is raging between the purist faction that demands a 1.5-liter three-cylinder and the marketing-driven party that would rather fit the i5 with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. However that pans out, sources say the plug-in i5 could benefit from inductive charging.Although all-wheel drive governed by torque vectoring is standard, there is no mechanical connection between the axles. While the mid-mounted battery pack in both variants will weigh between 880 pounds and 1,450 pounds, the target curb weight for the i5 is under 3,450 pounds, regardless of powertrain. Factor in a calculated drag coefficient of 0.24, and you have a family car that's not only frugal but should also be quite quick. With an aggregate power output of up to 400 hp and plenty of instant torque, it's safe to expect a 0 to 62 mph time of less than 4.5 seconds. Fuel consumption depends entirely on the chosen route and individual driving style, but one should be hard pressed to average below 45 mpg. It's early days as far as pricing is concerned, but a provisional estimate pegs the i5 at about a $5,500 premium over a plug-in 3 Series, which has yet to be released or priced out. Production of the BMW i5 will likely be assigned to the Leipzig plant, where production of the 1 Series and 3 Series would be phased out, with capacity at about 100,000 units per year.

Freight companies predicted that diesel drivers would be offered incentives to scrap their vehicles or face stiff new taxes.\n\nMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \"Industry recognises the issues around air quality and is keen to see policy that reflects the progress made on vehicle emissions and wider challenges of CO2 reduction.\"\n\n\"Policies to improve air quality should focus on encouraging the uptake of the latest low emission vehicles, while also addressing other sources such as electricity generation and heating, which between them account for more than half of NO2 emitted in the UK.\n\n\"Today's diesel engines are the cleanest ever, high tech filters capture 99 per cent of particulates and NO2 emissions are down 84 per cent since 2000.\"\n\n\"This isn't just an issue with diesel engines. This is something that encompasses many other sectors as well.\"", "Andy Murray progressed to the quarter-finals of the BMW Open after the top seed beat Mischa Zverev in straight sets on Thursday.\n\nThe Briton was given a first-round bye and quickly underlined his status as favourite for the title, sweeping aside world number 653 Zverev 6-2 6-2 in his first match since getting married.\n\nThe two-time grand slam winner won both break points that he earned in the first set and did not allow his German opponent an opportunity to fashion a solitary break point in Munich.\n\nMurray was made to work in the second set, saving six break points and winning three of his own to set up a last-eight encounter with Lukas Rosol.\n\nWorld number three Murray took control of the match by racing into a 4-0 lead before going on to serve out the set in only half an hour.\n\nHe then broke in the third game of the second set, but had to dig deep to save three break points in the following game and pressed home his advantage with another break to lead 5-2.\n\nMurray made hard work of serving for the match in a lengthy final game that saw Zverev have three chances to claim an elusive break, but eventually won his second match point to advance.\n\nLast year's runner-up Fabio Fognini crashed out in less than an hour as Dominic Thiem consigned the Italian to a 6-3 6-0 defeat.\n\nFognini beat Rafael Nadal in the Barcelona Open a week ago, but there was no sign of that form as the eighth seed bowed out in only 56 minutes.\n\nThiem broke Fognini seven times and saved seven break points to set up a quarter-final against qualifier Gerald Melzer, who went through when Pablo Andujar retired with to a groin injury when trailing 4-1 in the first set.\n\nRosol moved into the last eight at the expense of Sergiy Stakhovsky, who was beaten 7-5 6-2.", "To give a makeover to an existing model is not a new concept in automobile industry and since the time immemorial, each automaker has been trying the same in order to offer something new to its customers. The luxury auto giant BMW is also included in this list. The German auto giant, which launched its 1 Series in year 2005, has again brought before us a new BMW 1 Series with a complete makeover on all the fronts from exteriors, interiors, engines to dynamic technological updates.\n\nIt is to be noted that with the launch of BMW 1 Series way back in 2005, company gave consumers opportunity to own and drive a Bimmer and made this product a great hit for the brand. Until now, the auto giant has sold about 2 million 1 Series and with the launch of updated and refreshed model, it will only add to already inflated sales counts. As far as Indian launch is concerned, 2015 BMW 1 Series will soon make its debut in near future.\n\nAt the exteriors, the car continues to carry most of the features from its predecessor including long bonnet, short projection and emblematic set-back passenger section, but there are some delicate changes visible outside. The frontal side of the car sports a fresh apron with bigger air-intakes and a redesigned BMW grille. In addition to this, the newly developed headlamps and LED daytime running lights come as standard and the rear profile gets updates in terms of fresh L-shaped LED tail lamps.\n\nInside the car too, a complete new story awaits you. There can be seen a more comfy and sportier driver cockpit and seats wrapped with new cloth fabric. Apart from this, the iDrive operating system along with BMW radio Professional has now been made standard athwart the complete range of 1 Series. Furthermore, the centre console mounted controller wheel, chrome wrapped air vents, automatic air conditioning and the 6.5 inch control display along with direct control panel and favourite buttons are offering luxury vibes at its best.\n\nIt is also said that BMW will soon make the navigation system standard in 1 Series, probably from September onwards. This will make BMW, the first automotive brand to offer standard Navigation in its entire range. If someone wants more clear display than there also comes an optional professional Navigation unit with an 8.8 inch dieter screen.\n\nOn the mechanical front, new BMW 1 Series gets new engine line up to power the cars. The diesel power mill is now sourced from BMW's new engine family that complies with the Euro 6 emission benchmarks. With new turbocharged technology, the diesel engine in BMW 1 Series includes power efficient 3- cylinder and 4-cylinder units. While the 1.5 litre 3-cylinder, powering BMW 116d offers 116 hp power and 270Nm torque, the new 4-cylinder diesel mill has been integrated in 3 states of tune. In 118d, it offers 150hp power, the 120d and 125d gets 190hp and 224hp power respectively.\n\nThe petrol motors housed in the car come in 4 and 6-cylinder units. While the 2-litre 4-cylinder mill powering BMW 125i delivers 218 hp and 310 Nm torque, the 1.6 litre 4-cylinder unit churns out 136 hp and 170 hp in BMW 118i and BMW 120i correspondingly. The top end model in the Series- M135i is housed with a turbocharged straight-six engine, which is now capable of delivering 326 hp output and 450 Nm torque. This engine makes M135i to reach 0-100 kmph in just 4.9 seconds and attain a maximum speed of 250 kmph.\n\nTalking about transmission in new 1 Series, most of the cars in the range gets a 6-speed manual transmission; the 120d xDrive is coupled with an 8-speed Steptronic gearbox. This transmission can also be mated to other cars as an alternative. Other options are also given to BMW 120d, BMW 125i, BMW M135i and BMW 120d xDrive cars that include an 8-speed Sport AMT.\n\nThe carmaker has plans of launching 15 cars in 2015 and this 1 Series could be one of them.

Among the factors the study took into account, South Carolina finished among the 10 worst states in fatalities (first place), drunk driving (eighth place) and careless driving (fifth).\n\nMatt Mullins, the chief driver at the BMW performance center, sat down with Adrian Acosta to talk about the study, about some things drivers in the Upstate had questions about and other things drivers said were their pet peeves.\n\nAcosta: There are drivers that come to almost a complete stop before making a turn. What's the right way to do that?\n\nMullins: Use your turn signal and let the people behind you know what's about to happen. Start slowing down smooth and earlier as opposed to an abrupt stop. It benefits everybody because the traffic behind you can slow down smoothly.\n\nAcosta: Emergency blinkers, you see people using those all the time on the interstate. When are you supposed to use them?\n\nMullins: The name is pretty descriptive; it's for an emergency. If you're stopped on the side of the road and the car is disabled, if you have to come to a big stop on a highway, I think emergency flashers are appropriate to alert the cars behind you. If you're able to drive down the road for miles, don't have them on it's distracting and it loses value.\n\nAcosta: \"Days like today when it's foggy, some people use their high beams to help them see. What should they be doing?\n\nMullins: High beams in the fog usually light up the fog more. It's what fog lights are for, to light the road down low to help you see. High beams in the fog make your visibility much worse.\n\nAcosta: The blind spot - We've all had those close calls where we look and someone is in your blind spot. How should we be driving to avoid those kinds of wrecks?\"\n\nMullins: Having your front bumper in someone's blind spot is a bad idea. Leave a car length or so, so they and you have room to maneuver. If someone insists on riding in your blind spot either slow down and force them by or if you have room within the speed limit then get away and create that gap.\"\n\n\"Slow down,\" Mullins said. \"When in doubt you'd rather be a little bit slower than too fast.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 Fox Carolina (Meredith Corporation).

Neither did we until recently when we stumbled upon a bespoke BMW M3 that was wearing this color and it blew us away.\n\nThose of you that are familiar with the Audi range probably know what 'Nardo Grey' represents, right? It's a strong color that gives you the impression you've gone blind for a second or two when you see it for the first time.\n\nHowever, it's that complexity that mesmerizes and captivates over time, leaving an imprint on your retina. It's almost the same with Fashion Grey here.\n\nLooking at the pictures you'd be tempted to think that the car looks the same no matter what angle you look at it from. You'd be wrong though, this being a color that seems to be changing hues depending on the position you find yourself in.\n\nThere's even more to be admired on this F80 though.

The official debut will take place on June 17th, and we have fresh spy images showing just how close the design is to the C-Class.\n\nMind you, the similarity is no coincidence. The W205 C-Class launched last year has lent not only its platform, but also the name. For the first time, Mercedes will call its SUV in such a way as to mirror the sedans, so the GLC is like a the C-Class of the offroaders.\n\nThis black prototype, seen testing near Stuttgart, has streamlined headlights and character lines similar to the S-Class traveling down the side. The overall impression is very similar to the GLC Coupe Concept shown recently at the Shanghai Auto Show.\n\nThe GLC will be noticeably larger and more spacious than the GLK it replaces. In fact, we think it's going to be bigger than the first-generation M-Class. How do we know? BMW's X3 SUV and X4 SUV Coupe are exactly the same length, so we can compare the 4.73-meter (186.2 inches) length of the GLC Coupe concept to the 4.64-meter (182.6 inches) dimension of a 2002 ML model.\n\nMercedes-Benz also officially confirmed that sales of the GLC-Class will begin on September 12th, which essentially confirms the SUV will \u2315 GLC teaser photobe shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

Some are still hoping that there will be a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 powered by the 4-liter monster, but no prototypes have been seen yet.\n\nCurrently, the GLK 350 offers a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter with about 300 horsepower. It's the most popular model in America and will be replaced by the GLC 400. This will come with a 333 PS (329-hp) version of the same twin-turbo V6, resulting in huge improvements in torque and moderate MPG upgrades. 2-liter turbos should also be available, coming in the form of the 245 PS (241-hp) GLC 300 or the 211 PS (209-hp) GLC 250.\n\nFor Europe, the diesel range will begin with the a 204 PS version of the 2.1-liter CDI and work its way down.

The so-called eCall device will automatically alert the nearest emergency centre in the event of a crash by calling the EU-wide emergency number 112 - the equivalent of the UK's '999' - even if the occupants are in no state to dial for help themselves.\n\nThis will give authorities information such as the exact location and time of the crash and the number of passengers in the vehicle.\n\nThe system is designed to automatically transmit accident details - the time of the incident, the position of the crash and the direction of travel, which could be crucial for accidents on motorways or in tunnels.\n\nThe Commission has estimated the cost of installing the system at less than \u00a390 per car.\n\nSome car-firms, such as Vauxhall's parent company General Motors, already offer such services as part of a wider package.\n\nMembers of the European Parliament in Strasbourg approved the law on Tuesday. It means car manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Volvo would have to ensure all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are fitted with the devices by March 31, 2018.\n\nThe vote was welcomed by the motor industry.\n\nErik Jonnaert, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association which includes companies such as BMW, Fiat and Daimler said: 'This decision brings Europe one step closer to making operational a system which we have been advocating since 2004.'\n\nRoad accidents killed 25,700 people in the EU last year.\n\nThe European Commission, which proposed the law, estimates that the emergency response time will halve in the countryside and fall 60 per cent in urban areas.\n\nPeople would also be able to make an eCall by pushing a button inside the car, giving witnesses a chance to report accidents.\n\nThe devices will not track vehicles outside emergencies and authorities will not be able to transfer the data to third parties without the explicit consent of the person concerned.\n\nBut some members of the European Parliament said the proposal did not go far enough to protect drivers' privacy and did nothing to prevent accidents.\n\nVicky Ford, a Conservative MEP said: 'Just putting in the infrastructure for this would eat up a huge chunk of the road safety budget, yet it will not prevent a single crash.'\n\nThe UK government had objected to the plans saying the cost of '\u00a3370-odd million' would far outweigh the benefits.\n\nIn December Conservative Transport Minister Claire Perry said the Government did not support the measure noting: 'According to our analysis, the benefit of making [eCall] mandatory in all new cars does not justify the cost of implementing it.\n\n'I believe it was something like \u00a3370-odd million. There was a view that, given the increasing responsiveness of our road network... we did not feel that it was appropriate for the UK.'\n\n'But the Automobile Association welcomed the decision and said it could 'save lives across Europe'.\n\nAA head of roads policy Paul Watters said the Government will need to 'have its act together' to make sure our emergency services are ready for the new system.\n\nHe said: 'The question is whether it will automatically dispatch the appropriate emergency services. The supporting infrastructure would need to be in place to make sure that it works.'\n\nHe said the devices will be of greater benefit in less 'congested' European countries, where unseen accidents in remote areas are far more likely, noting: 'The benefits to the UK are probably less than other larger, more spaced out countries.\n\n'We have fewer remote places where somebody could be incapacitated in a car, where it would save someone's life.'", "SOARING housing costs mean Oxford workers are spending increasingly high proportions of their wages on renting a place in the city.\n\nRents have shot up by up to 20 per cent in recent years but wages have failed to keep pace, making Oxford one of the least affordable places in the country.\n\nA one-bedroom flat costs around \u00a31,270 a month to rent.\n\nThis equates to \u00a315,240 a year - more than 50 per cent of the average wage of \u00a324,000 a year, according to property website home.co.uk's Oxford Market Rent Summary.\n\nTwo-bedroom properties are typically priced at \u00a31,743 per month, with three-bedrooms at \u00a31,853 per month.\n\nEven renting one room in a shared house with communal living room and bathroom will set a tenant back \u00a3600 per month.\n\nFrances Place, who works for East Oxford-based digital agency White October, pays \u00a3500 a month to share a house off Cowley Road.\n\nShe said: \"I would like to buy a place, because renting feels like a waste of money, but it's so expensive to save for a deposit.\n\n\"Putting enough money aside while affording rent is very difficult.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old account manager said she would have to move out of the city to afford her own place.\n\nShe added: \"Buying in Oxford doesn't seem possible at all.\n\n\"I will need to move further out but if I do that, then I have to pay more to commute back in, as my job is in Oxford.\"\n\nLiz Nutall, senior lettings agent at Breckon & Breckon estate agents, said: \"Prices have been going up steadily since the end of the so-called recession, which didn't really hit Oxford to the extent it did the rest of the country.\n\n\"There have been increases of between 10 and 20 per cent per calender month, so there are some fairly steep increases happening.\"\n\nShe added: \"We've got the hospital, university, BMW, all the science parks, but there's not enough property.\"\n\nMs Nutall's agency markets rooms in a shared house in Brock Grove Street, near Botley Road, at \u00a3675 per month, with tenants sharing a living room and bathroom.\n\nA 1930s-style family house in Edgeway Road, Cowley, would fetch \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,600 per month and a two-bedroom house in Albert Street, Jericho, \u00a31,750 per month.\n\nAt the top of the range, a fourbedroom house in St John Street costs \u00a33,450 per month.\n\nPeter Meinertzhagen, 27, commutes every day from his home in Chipping Norton to his job as a digital marketing manager in Oxford.\n\nHe is hoping to put in an offer for a house in Temple Cowley, but said it has not been easy to find somewhere affordable.\n\nHe said: \"There is a real lack of affordable homes.

As he says in the video, one day one of his friends took him for a spin through a classic car market, where Helmut was intrigued by a chassis that had the BMW roundel on it.\n\nIt was basically a skeleton with a few boxes on, including a dash and other parts, all packed up in banana boxes.

During this time, he traveled across Europe to get the parts he needed and spent over 1,700 man hours working on it, spread across ten years.\n\nIn the end, he came up with a car that looks absolutely incredible, completely original and even drivable. The thing is, being made back in the 1930s, the 303 uses an old gearbox layout and is pretty hard to drive.\n\nHelmut himself claims that the first time he drove it, people started looking around and staring at the car but not because of its looks but rather because of the noises it made when he changed gears.

Check it out!\n\nPlay Video", "There are a handful of hybrid cars in India; when I say handful, I mean just three. There's the Toyota Prius, Camry and the BMW i8. That's it. So, when Toyota said that there is a facelift coming of the Camry Hybrid, I was a bit surprised. Considering that the segment hasn't really picked up in terms of sales, it was a move that made everyone wonder about the strategy they had.\n\nThe Camry was first brought to India in 2002 and since then Toyota has sold 8000 units till date. When I asked how much it sold last year, the prompt answer was around 700 odd units. The surprising bit though was that 73% (532 units) of the cars sold were hybrids while the rest were the conventional petrol lot. The fact that there are more hybrids sold in India, shows that there is a market and that seems to justify why Toyota has brought the facelift of the 7th generation of the Camry to India.\n\nSo what is this facelift all about? Well, Toyota has given the new Camry a whole bunch of exterior changes. These include a slimmer front grill and sleek looking headlamps, so it's not at all boring now and looks pretty good. Toyota has also given the Camry LED daytime running lights, while also giving LED main lamps. There is a bit of a bulge on top of the bonnet which gives the front a bit of character, while the massive trapezoidal air dam at the front brings out the wild side of the car. There are changes to the rear as well and overall, the facelift does wonders to the look of the Camry.\n\nHowever, I have to admit that there's a lot of chrome; probably an overdose of it. The chrome strips run around the chin at the front, the air dam, the door handles, the window sills, the rear and even the tip of the rear bumper. It's all in the name of making it look up market but well, there's a lot.\n\nAs we move to the inside of the car, there is a bit of familiarity. There's a lot picked up from the pre-facelift version but none of it feels old fashioned. The centre console is U-shaped and the there's also a new colour information display in the centre of the instrument panel. Thanks to the 3-zone automatic Climate control, the rear seat, as on the previous car, gets its own temperature setting. In fact, the rear seat backs recline up to eight degrees, and is a place to be pampered in.\n\nThere have been a whole bunch of changes made to the exterior of the car, but under the hood is the same old affair. Toyota's DOHC VVT-i 2.5-litre petrol unit and the electric motor work together to churn out 202bhp - 158bhp from the petrol motor, and 44bhp from the electric motor. The power split device helps to deliver seamless power to the wheels, and also to the generator that keeps on charging the battery. The battery is nickel metal hydride, unlike the usual lithium-ion, and is placed inside the boot.\n\nThere are two driving modes to choose from - EV and Eco. The EV mode kicks in if you're stuck in traffic, as it doesn't allow you to go above 40km/h. If you switch to Eco mode where the electric motor and the petrol engine work hand-in-hand with one another, the hybrid systems jigsaw is solved. The result is that you're immediately transported into an evolved and refined driving experience, not to forget an efficient one.\n\nThen there's the e-CVT (electronically continuously variable transmission), which the engine is mated to and when you floor the accelerator, the revs build up and though delayed, the power delivery is seamless. The torquey petrol engine takes off its gloves and provides immense energy, which truly builds your excitement levels. The ride quality too is refined and Toyota says that they have re-tuned the shock absorbers to help the Camry eat up the bumps on the road. Efficiency wise, Toyota claims that the Camry Hybrid delivers 19.6km/l (ARAI figures), which is truly impressive for a car of this size.\n\nNow, we come down to the price of the car and at Rs. 31.92 lakhs (ex-showroom Delhi) it is pretty steep. In fact it treads on the territory of the luxury car makers like Audi, Mercedes and BMW. This might be a worrying factor for Toyota but the ace up their sleeve is the hybrid system in the car and thanks to the FAME-India scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles in India), recently introduced by the Indian government, it will receive a relief of Rs. 70,000 which the car maker will pass on to the customer. Yes, it's expensive but that's the price you pay for luxury, innovations and fuel-saving technology.", "(M.Brauck, D.Hawranek, S.Salden and B.Zand - Der Spiegel, 18/04/15) - One day, Claudia Langer found herself in the midst of a spending spree.

It ended up being a traumatic experience. \"I deliberately bought the car with the lowest carbon emissions in its category, but I was duped by the advertising.\" Buying it was an act of sheer self-denial, she says now, and a total mistake. \"My children laughed at me. The second you pick up a bit of speed, you start guzzling gas.\"\n\nAnyone who has ever tried making environmentally friendly or socially and politically responsible consumer choices knows how tempting is can be to eat, buy and waste whatever you'd like or to buy whatever is cheapest. It can be freeing to do so without a guilty conscience, without feeling like you are destroying the planet, without worrying about the consequences.\n\nAnd that day in the toy store, Claudia Langer wasn't just giving in to a whim. She was admitting defeat, turning her back on the idea that ethical consumerism alone could change the world and that her business could revolutionize Germans' consumer behavior.\n\nWaiting for Critical Mass\n\nIt's not that Utopia wasn't a success: The website was admired and practical, and had a steadily growing consumer base, but Langer thought it was all taking much too long. She felt like she was preaching to the converted, the 15 percent of the population who didn't need to be convinced to buy ethically. She wanted to reach the mainstream, but the mainstream wasn't interested.\n\n\"My utopian vision was that consumer pressure on businesses and corporate pressure on politics could change the world,\" says Langer. \"But as long as there isn't a critical mass of consumers harnessing their power, we won't be in a position to create a better future for our children.\"\n\nHer message may be bleak, but she's not alone in her doubts. Many other Germans want to be responsible consumers, but have also come to the realization that saving the planet through purchasing choices is actually a lot of work. \"Consumers aren't good allies either for industry or politics,\" says Langer. \"They're hypocrites, always keen to point the finger of blame and pass the buck whenever it's time to take responsibility themselves.\"\n\nClaudia Langer has by no means given up on conscientious consumerism. But now and then she treats herself to a long-haul flight or enjoys a snack without knowing its ethical credentials. She's no longer quite as strict as she used to be. But is that acceptable, given the stakes?\n\nEven before consumers can start making ethically informed choices, hundreds of decisions have to be made in company headquarters, factories, marketing departments, supply chains and on the part of subcontractors. The decisions must be made by managers, inspectors and companies alike -- and untangling them can be nearly impossible.\n\nKeal Leangky, Cambodia\n\nIn Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a dirt road runs through the western part of the city, where industry gives way to rice paddies. Twenty-one-year-old Keal Leangky, a seamstress, is sitting in a hut outside the factory where she worked for two years, dressed in a red t-shirt and blue harem pants. \"I should never have eaten that mango,\" she says.\n\nA few months ago, in the middle of the rainy season, Leangky was nearing the end of her afternoon shift when she was overcome with hunger. She took a mango out of her bag and began to eat it. \"The foreman, who was Chinese, saw me and started yelling at me. He went and fetched a translator who told me I had to stop eating.\"\n\nColleagues came over to help her. Leangky was two months pregnant and she'd always met her quotas, they argued, and she couldn't be treated like that. The foreman should apologize, or all 15 of them would lay down their tools.\n\nKeal Leangky and her team are now all out of work. \"They threw us all out,\" says her friend Chorn Rasy. They were paid for the work they'd done -- Keal Leangky got $35 -- but 15 garment workers with CWKH Garment Cambodia Ltd., a T-shirt factory with about 400 employees, ended up getting fired.\n\nIn the following weeks and months, more and more of the colleagues who rallied in support of Leangky were also fired, bringing the total number of people who lost their jobs over the incident to around 200. They protested as best they could, through legal and symbolic means: Since getting sacked, Leangky and her colleagues often trek from their ramshackle homes to the factory, making their way through mountains of garbage to arrive at the same time they used to start work. They sometimes make the trip every day of the week, wearing their old work passes round their necks. They want their jobs back -- but they're not allowed into the building. The gates to the factory remain closed.\n\n\"We lodged a complaint with the court of arbitration,\" says Leangky. \"But we don't stand a chance. They say our strike was illegal and we need to look for new jobs. Now our experience is worthless. Our next wages will be entry-level.\"\n\nA Turning Point\n\nIn Cambodia, one of the most productive of the global textile industry's low-cost hubs, entry-level translates to $100 a month for a six-day work week and shifts that are up to 12 hours long.\n\nStories like these have shaken consumers. Two years ago, on April 24, 2013, the Rana Plaza complex collapsed in Savar, Bangladesh. Some 3,000 garment workers were in the building at the time, and the disaster claimed 1,134 lives. Images of the Savar collapse are now seared into the collective memory -- and in consumers' guilty consciences.\n\nBut conditions have not improved. Textiles manufacturers continue to invest in sites where there is \"no rule of law but extreme poverty and an investor-friendly government,\" explains labor lawyer David Welsh, who works for the US NGO Solidarity Center in Phnom Penh. \"But then they often act as if they're only in these countries in order to improve social conditions there.\"\n\nConsumers, politicians and members of the textiles industry were shocked by what happened at Rana Plaza. The disaster made T-shirt production a top agenda point in the industry and among politicians. Gerd M\u00fcller, German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, is now pushing for what he calls a \"Textile Alliance\" against exploitation. It was a turning point for the issue of ethical consumption.\n\nHans-Otto Schrader, Hamburg\n\nIn Germany, over 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles) west of Rana Plaza, Hans-Otto Schrader, CEO of the Otto Group, a mail-order giant and one of the world's largest e-commerce sites, has a surprising confession to make. He's just been talking about a tree project his company is organizing in Africa and describing the Otto Group's tradition of social conscience. He has personally become increasingly aware of sustainability issues, he says, and explains the horror he felt when a toy factory went up in flames in Thailand in 1987. His message: The Otto Group has an exemplary social and environmental record.\n\nHis claims are believable, but then he makes a disarmingly honest statement. Asked why Otto doesn't make this record part of its image, he says, \"We need to be careful, so we purposely keep it out of our communications strategy.\"\n\nHe is worried about the power of the consumer and the Internet -- the combined clout of buyers and the media. \"Our belief is that you won't necessarily be rewarded by customers and markets just because you're making more of an effort than your competitors,\" he says. \"But you will be punished if you make a mistake.\"\n\nSchrader goes so far as to refer to a \"culture of outrage\" surrounding the issue of ethical consumerism. \"If you stick your neck out too far and someone finds out your track record is less than pristine, you'll end up a target of outrage that can destroy everything you've built up in one fell swoop.\"\n\nIt sounds defeatist, especially given Otto's need for an image upgrade. Not only is the company seen as dowdy, it is also being cornered by Amazon. But it's true that the media and customers are especially quick to blame supposed \"good guys\" for any breaches of ethical codes -- as drugstore chain dm, Germany's most popular retailer, can attest to. Shortly before Christmas, a blogger found out that the company was no longer solely manufacturing its cloth bags in a factory in Augsburg, Germany, that hires the long-term unemployed -- and that it had begun having them produced in India.\n\nA storm of indignation erupted on Twitter, with the hashtag #Taschengate, or Bag-gate. The media picked up the story, and before dm even had a chance to explain itself, its reputation as an ethical company had come under fire.\n\nIt was exactly the sort of response Otto chief executive Schrader fears. \"If it comes to my attention that a product in our range has a demonstrably unethical provenance then I'll take it off the shelves immediately,\" he says. \"The trouble is: How can mass market retailers provide a 100 percent ethical guarantee for products we don't always manufacture ourselves?\"\n\nMoreover, if a company such as Otto can't provide this guarantee, how can consumers be expected to make responsible choices?\n\nIn the aftermath of the Rana Plaza disaster, international fashion companies and trade unions joined forces to investigate the soundness of structures in Bengali garment factories and improve the most egregious safety problems. Controllers were shocked by what they found: Not a single one of the 1,100 factories they visited stood up to scrutiny.\n\nAs Maren Barthel of the Otto Group says, it was a \"wake-up call\" for the industry. Along with a team of 21, Barthel is in charge of the purchasing and production conditions in the company's manufacturing countries, including Bangladesh. As she points out, it's one thing to compile catalogues of standards and get suppliers to sign them, but quite another to ensure those standards are maintained. Barthel has to be pretty imaginative in her quest to identify possible violations -- sometimes, even a sewing machine needle can be a giveaway.\n\nIf one of these needles breaks, it has to be recorded in a logbook -- mainly because the last thing textiles companies want is customers getting injured by a piece of broken needle. So Barthel perused logbooks to see if they indicated that employees had been working on Sundays and public holidays. A few suppliers were caught red handed. \"Obviously word then got out that we check the logbooks, and of course it's possible that a factory might fiddle the dates,\" says Barthel. \"It is and remains a game of cat and mouse.\"\n\nGray Areas\n\nOtto sells over 2 million products and works with several thousand suppliers in over 70 countries. Even if Barthel manages to keep tabs on the 200 sewing factories contracted to Otto, they're just one cog in the manufacturing process. Even Otto's \"Cotton made in Africa\" project -- designed to boost conditions in cotton harvesting and spinning plants -- is just a drop in the ocean.\n\n\"For the time being, it's still hard to follow what happens between the spinning plant and the sewing factory,\" says Johannes Merck, director of corporate responsibility at Otto. Problematically, dyeing and finishing is when the most environmentally egregious steps occur.\n\n\"We're trying to reconcile two aspects of the flow of materials, which is complex and time-consuming,\" says Merck. As he points out, it took years to untangle the sewing factories' dense network of subcontractors, sub-subcontractors and sub-sub-subcontractors. \"At this point in time, it's impossible to take responsibility for the entire production chain.\"\n\nWhether it's even possible for a mail-order business on the scale of Otto -- which is geared to bulk sales -- to make a genuine shift to sustainability is, of course, a moot point. But by admitting to its limitations, the company is at least giving itself room to consider the issues, creating gray areas where usually there is only black and white, bad consumerism versus good consumerism, good consumers versus bad companies or even good companies versus bad consumers.\n\nNorbert Reithofer, Paris\n\nPeace at last. Norbert Reithofer has closed the door to his conference room and shut out the din of the BMW salesroom in Paris. Outside, there's a roar of music and the sounds of manufacturers making announcements about the cars of tomorrow. Inside, the only noise is the hum of the air conditioning.\n\nIt's a Thursday in early October, and BMW's CEO has been busy since 7:00 in the morning, going from appointment to appointment, attending presentations, giving interviews and chairing meetings. Right now he's taking a break and talking about the development of BMW's i3 electric car, a project worth billions, which Reithofer hopes will make BMW the most environmentally friendly car manufacturer in the world.\n\nReithofer recounts a long drawn out struggle. BMW is inevitably associated with 12-cylinder engines and Formula One racing, and even if Reithofer ultimately emerged victorious, he faced his share of setbacks. The Munich-based company has a lot riding on the i3, which purports to be the ultimate green car. It represents an acid test for ethical consumerism -- an expensive one, since one car costs customers at least \u20ac34,950 ($37,072). But it remains unclear whether consumers will reward the company for ticking all of the ethical boxes.\n\nThe wood on its dashboard is sourced from sustainably managed forests; the seats are made almost 100 percent from recycled polyester. The leather is treated with a natural tanning agent made from olive leaves and the door paneling is made from hemp fibers. So long as the car's electric batteries are powered by wind, water or sun power, carbon emissions are zero. Ninety-five percent of the materials used in the production of the i3 are recyclable. The list could go on. It's a car tailor-made for ethically aware customers.\n\nSteering a New Course\n\nBack in 2007, the i3 was just a twinkle in BMW's eye. The idea came out of a meeting of top managers that CEO Norbert Reithofer convened at Tegernsee, a lake just south of Munich. The goal: to talk about ways of ensuring BMW would still be one of the world's leading carmakers in the year 2020.\n\nA number of attendees suggested the company take over Volvo, Saab or a truck manufacturer. These became known as the \"fuel faction.\" Reithofer and two others disagreed, and were dubbed the \"green group\" -- which, in a company that is basically an engine manufacturer, wasn't exactly meant as a compliment.\n\nBut Reithofer was determined the company must steer a new course. Business as usual, he was convinced, was no longer an option. What benefit would BMW derive from acquiring a manufacturer who still builds cars with conventional engines? Given the serious smog problems faced by cities in China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies, their governments would soon have no choice but to reduce traffic. Emissions limits had already been introduced in Europe and the United States, making it high time BMW's engineers came up with a clean \"Megacity Vehicle.\" Although Reithofer ultimately prevailed, some managers in the \"fuel faction\" were quietly waiting for the chief executive -- and his \u20ac3 billion project -- to fail.\n\nThe electric car may never have been built had Reithofer not employed a trick: When he commissioned the design, Reithofer gave the job to Ulrich Kranz, a trained mechanical engineer, instead of the normal development department. Two things about Kranz made him uniquely qualified for the job. He had experience developing cars, including the Mini, but he also had an interest in future mobility concepts. Kranz was allowed to tap people directly from all departments as the company moved forward with \"Project i.\" This helped make him the butt of jokes from representatives of the main division.\n\nBut in Reithofer's view, far more was at stake than just \"Project i\" -- his ultimate goal was to take BMW in a new direction. He wasn't wary of taking serious symbolic steps either, including bringing former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the Green Party on board as a business consultant and ending BMW's sponsorship of Formula One racing.\n\nBut when Reithofer questioned the need for BMW to continue manufacturing 12-cylinder engines, detractors inside the company began airing their grievances openly. Executives accused the BMW chairman of abandoning the company's core market and former BMW chief executives briefly came out of retirement to criticize the idea. Reithofer began to doubt whether his plan could succeed.\n\nHe yielded slightly -- at least when it came to the motor. He invited former top executives to a meeting, with a 12-cylinder motor positioned in the center of the room like a throne. \"Don't worry,\" Reithofer told his predecessors, BMW will continue to manufacture it. But when it came to the company's overall future direction, the BMW CEO did not budge.\n\nLowering Emissions\n\nMeanwhile, Kranz went about ensuring the lowest-possible CO2 emissions in the new line of cars. Because it is energy-intensive to manufacture the carbon fiber used in a plastic car-body, BMW built a factory in the United States that draws its power from a hydroelectric plant. The factory in Leipzig where the i3 is assembled, furthermore, uses electricity generated from wind turbines.\n\nFor every car part, a sustainability manager reviewed whether an alternative with even lower CO2 emissions was available. The eucalyptus wood on the dashboard, for example, is only treated with chalk instead of the usual five layers of lacquer.\n\nKranz and his team made good progress, and one day Reithofer got an unexpected visit from Adrian van Hooydonk. The chief BMW designer told him that the development team had secretly built a car and asked the chairman if he wanted to see it. He then unveiled a futuristic electric sports car. Project i had apparently gone from being the source of mockery to inspiring company developers to secretly design a car of their own. As a result, BMW now sells two electric cars, the i3 and the i8.\n\nThe ball is now in Reithofter's court. He has an appointment with a French government minister, his secretary reminds him. But the BMW chief executive has one other thing he'd like to say: \"Electric cars aren't an option for our company. They're a must.\"\n\nThat may be the case. But so far, they haven't been a must for car buyers. According to the company's statistics, BMW sold 2,233 i3 models in Germany during the past year. During that time, it sold 12,664 -- five times as many -- of its X5 model of sport utility vehicles with a 306 horsepower engine and average CO2 emissions of 199 grams.\n\nThe numbers seem to suggest what Meike Gebhard, who succeeded Claudia Langer as CEO of Utopia, already suspects. \"The less a consumer article has to do with a person's body,\" she says, \"the less prepared a person is to act ethically.\" This is why, she argues, the greatest interest among \"ethical consumers\" is in food and cosmetics.\n\nAdam Elman, London\n\nAdam Elman grabs the small black card from the table in the Marks & Spencer caf\u00e9. We're sitting in one of the chain's department stores in London's Shepherd's Bush neighborhood and the card proclaims that the caf\u00e9's coffee is fair trade. Music plays in the background as customers recline in chic designer chairs. Elman, a Marks & Spencer manager, describes how a British department store chain can do its part to save the planet. \"Here, have a look,\" Elman says wagging the card. \"The message is clear, but subtle. After all, we want the customers to be able to relax here.\"\n\nOf course, relaxation isn't exactly what most people in Germany associate with ethical consumerism. Here, the perception is that acting \"correctly\" must mean denying oneself nice things -- an attitude that may also explain the grim tone frequently used in the German debate about sustainable consumption.\n\nWhen it comes to ethical consumerism, a little less perfectionism and a little more relaxation may deliver better results. And that's what managers like Elman are attempting at Marks & Spencer. Elman is part of a team implementing a sustainability plan launched by the company in 2007 under the slogan, \"Plan A, because there is no Plan B for this planet.\" The company has adopted an entirely different approach than its competitors. People at M&S don't waste a lot of time whining about the risks of inscrutable global trade. Here, workers are proud of every solar cell on the roof and each fair trade leaflet -- and they're not that uptight about it.\n\nThis attitude is crucial to Plan A: \"We want to convey the feeling that it isn't bad if you're not at 100 percent in every area,\" says Elman. \"What's important is that we have begun to strive for 100 percent.\"\n\nIt's the details that matter. The number of milliliters of water used to ensure the freshness of every flower stem during transport, for example. Since the beginning of 2014, the traditional British department store has shipped its bouquets in air-tight packaging without water. \"That protects the flowers during transport and we save up to a half a million liters of water per year,\" says Elman.\n\nAt the start of the campaign, the company formulated 100 different resolutions: These ranged from using electricity from renewable energies to reducing packaging waste to decreasing the number of flights taken on business trips and improving standards for textile production. The goal is to set ambitious targets in all areas of the business while maintaining communication about what is and isn't working and why some areas are more challenging than others.\n\nThe impetus for Plan A was a poll showing that M&S customers expect the company to be thinking of ways to improve the world. It also found that the customers didn't always want to be wondering whether a pillow or a lipstick would be an ethically correct purchase or not. \"The customers want to be able to place their trust in an entire brand,\" Elman says.\n\n\"Only if it's right we put our name on it,\" reads a black sign in the men's department of the store. The fact the Marks & Spencer mostly sells its own products also gives it a competitive advantage. Around 99 percent of the goods sold at its stores are marketed under its own brand, from lamp shades to sunglasses to sheets and peanut butter, and many companies manufacture exclusively for M&S.\n\nThe company works with more than 3,000 suppliers, many of which do most of their business with the department store giant. Elman says joint solutions are essential.\n\n\"Wait a second, I'm going to show you an example,\" he says, rushing through the Shepherd's Bush store. He comes to a stop in the cosmetics department and grabs a deep violet jar of skin cream from the shelf. The illuminated ad next to it features dark grapes. \"We wanted to expand our line of organic cosmetics,\" Elman explains, \"so we brought together our largest wine supplier and a cosmetics manufacturer. Now, we are creating something new with the pressed grape pulp left over that isn't used to make wine.\"\n\nReferences to Plan A are discreetly distributed throughout the store, with small signs offering short but clear messages. They can be found everywhere from the meat counter in the food section to the clothing department and provide information about where the beef or the cotton comes from, or explain that the cashiers don't give away clothes hangers because they re-use them. Marks & Spencer is more than just a department store with an organic section, it's trying to make its entire operation as sustainable as possible.\n\nPlan A is an ongoing process and that's important to him, Elman says. He thinks it's great that the company has wholeheartedly embraced the strategy. Many managers' bonuses, for example, are pegged to their departments' Plan A goals.\n\nElman is surprisingly relaxed when he talks about failures, though that may be the product of British diffidence. \"We don't just automatically fire each partner if we discover a mistake or a violation of our guidelines,\" he says. That wouldn't be cost effective, and would be too short-sighted. \"We try, if there is any way possible, to find the cause of the problem and solve it together.\"\n\nHe then hastens to the men's suits section. Next to the QR-Code on the inner-lining of a sport coat the words, \"I am extraordinary, scan me to find out why,\" appear. The suit is made of recycled scrap clothing, Elman proudly explains.\n\nThe suit is the product of the company's \"Shwopping\" campaign against disposable fashion. \"Every five minutes, 10,000 garments are thrown away in Great Britain,\" Adam Elman says of the campaign Marks & Spencer mounted together with the international relief organization Oxfam. In 2014, Marks & Spencer customers donated 4 million old pieces of clothing, up from 3.8 million the previous year. The used clothing is then either sold by Oxfam to raise money for its programs or recycled. \"You have to make it easier for the customers to do something good,\" Elman says.\n\nVittorio H\u00f6sle, Notre Dame, USA\n\nThe Marks & Spencer concept makes reconciling ethics and consumerism -- and then acting on it -- look easy. But consumerism is not a very rational matter in practice.\n\nPhilosopher Vittorio H\u00f6sle has spent a lot of time thinking about the fundamental tension between consumerism and work. H\u00f6sle, who is German, teaches at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. He's a man of contradictions: Pope Francis appointed him to the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, but some newspapers have also dubbed him \"the Boris Becker of philosophy.\" The problem, as H\u00f6sle sees it, is that it is extremely difficult to reconcile ethical consumerism with capitalism.\n\n\"Even long before Adam Smith, the moral of capitalism was based on the discovery that each could act according to his own ego -- in fact should act on it because it would lead to greater prosperity for all in the end,\" he says. \"Over a period of hundreds of years, ethical standards once considered to be self-evident have been destroyed. For example, we lost appreciation for the idea that a person must sometimes refrain from pursuing his or her own interests for the sake of the greater whole.\"\n\nBut how is ethical consumption supposed to work when it costs the individual more? H\u00f6sle describes himself as an ethical consumer. He doesn't eat meat and says he has no interest in impulse buying or luxury goods. He says he hasn't ever even purchased jewelry for his wife. \"We're not interested in stuff like that,\" he says.\n\nAsceticism, reserve and discipline do exist in capitalism -- at least in terms of labor and manufacturing -- but they are always compensated for with an increase in consumption. \"It's fundamental to capitalism that reserve is eventually rewarded with more consumption,\" says H\u00f6sle. \"It's hard to break through that. That is, unless you say: You don't want to just be able to consume today, but also in 20 years, and you also want your children to still be able to consume.\"\n\nFrom Theory to Practice\n\nEthical consumerism is undoubtedly good for the world. It does matter, after all, if a person's actions cause harm to other people and future generations. It's important that purchasing decisions actually benefit others. And it does matter if a person's behavior wastes energy, pollutes our air or poisons our water. But well-meaning customers often feel more helpless than empowered when shopping. More than anything, they feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe flood of information can be intimidating: Every purchase of a t-shirt is a potential sin, every cup of coffee contains a risk of exploitation and every kilowatt hour of electricity is a potential climate offense. Indeed, it seems that any purchase can steer a person astray.\n\nEven when consumers think they're making a safe decision, the next ethical trap is already waiting. Take the organic cotton label on a T-shirt, for example. It provides no indication of the working conditions where it was made. Could it have been a sweat shop? And an organic tomato that is transported hundreds of kilometers on its way to a store is no better for the environment than a normal tomato harvested nearby. Meanwhile, the batteries in electric cars contain rare earth and metals whose sources are often dubious. And even with fair-trade coffee, the country of origin gets only a fraction of the proceeds from sales because most of the money is earned after the coffee is roasted in Europe or North America.\n\nIn a trend study conducted in 2013 by Otto Group, 56 percent of Germans said they \"often\" bought ethically correct products. Four years earlier, that figure was only 26 percent. And an incredible 89 percent of all those surveyed said they at least did so occasionally. Yet despite these figures, ethically sound goods remain a niche business.\n\nOriginal source: http://www.spiegel.de/international/how-we-can-become-ethical-consumers-a-1028298.html", "Parking spaces with EV chargers increase the need for common courtesy, and broader awareness of EV etiquette. There are finite possibilities for parking spaces with EV chargers and sometimes long charging times are needed.\n\nOf course, the most basic thing is that you shouldn't park in a charging spot if you are not driving a fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric car and there are other parking spots available.\n\nFor those driving plug-in cars, there are then many questions: Who was there first? Who needs it more? Since that car is a plug-in hybrid, does it really need that charge like a pure electric car does? Is this EV simply \"opportunity charging\" to top off their battery while I cannot get home without a charge? What to do about a fully charged EV (Tesla or LEAF, for example) with a lock on the connector as the car sits in the charging spot?\n\nAs you can see, clear EV etiquette and etiquette training are needed. The cool idea pictured below is a good step in that direction. \"Do Not Unplug\" and \"OK To Unplug\" hanger signs should be sitting in every EV driver's glovebox.\n\nIf your EV is only opportunity charging, you can leave a sign for another driver that it is okay to unplug you. Even if you need a charge, you can indicate what time you expect to be done and also leave your phone #.\n\nJack Brown figured this one out for all EV owners to appreciate (h/t Tom Moloughney of BMWi3blogspot.com).\n\nWith notes on broader charging ideals, EV Obsession reminds us that if you can stick solar panels on your roof, you should do that.

This respectable and serious German car company has just released a video where an R8 literally gives birth to the new RS3 Sportback hyper hatchback.\n\n'Birth' is definitely the oddest video we've ever seen from Audi. It's like \u00c6on Flux or one of those Bjork music videos where robots have intercourse.\n\nProbably in order to show us that the quattro supercar has a lot in common with the RS3, we see the R8 graphically widening its hips to release the hatchback. It's covered in a placenta and oozes liquid.\n\nMatrix-like robots take care of washing the baby car and bringing it into the world. But instead of cuddly, motherly feelings, we feel inundated with fear and disgust. At the end of the process, the R8 looks like a broken husk of a human after the alien baby emerged from its belly, not a joyful mother.\n\nIf the R8 is the mother, who is the father of the RS3? We think the RS6 fits that description perfectly, otherwise how else do you explain the presence of the hatchback. But the deadbeat dad is nowhere to be seen, probably off drinking race fuel with his BMW and Mercedes buddies or blowing up the skirt of a Porsche.\n\nIf your kids are begging you to tell them how all the characters in Cars or Planes are born, just show them this video.\n\nPlay Video", "It seems like American car makers are bound to offer incredible bang for buck ratios these days, and the new Cadillac CTS-V is no exception. GM just announced the prices for its sports sedan and it's cheaper than expected.\n\nPrices for the 2016 CTS-V will start at $83,995 MSRP which is $10,000 less than a BMW M5 and $18,000 less than a Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG S 4Matic. That's right, the Caddy is not only more powerful than its German rivals but also cheaper, by quite a lot.\n\nIf you want to extrapolate, the Audi RS7 could also be included on this list, despite having a different body style. In this case, however, the difference goes up to around $25,000.\n\nCall it what you want but from where we're standing, it's pretty obvious that the CTS-V is a bargain in the segment. It will be interesting to see how the Germans will react though as the American will surely bite into their sales on the long run.\n\nOn the performance side, things don't look all that great either. The BMW M5, for example, has 80 less HP coming out of its 4.4-liter V8 compared to the ATS-V's 640 HP from a 6.2-liter supercharged V8. The Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG is also down on power with 577 HP. However, the Merc has a slight advantage in straight up acceleration reaching 60 mph in 3.4 seconds thanks to its all-wheel drive system.\n\nThe rear-wheel drive M5 does the same sprint in 4.2 seconds while the new kid on the block will do it in 3.7.

V-Series matches or overtakes the finest cars in this elite class while being more accessible.\"\n\nWell, those are some big words, especially since de Nysschen's car will be going up against the creator of the niche it's operating in, the M5. However, things are not looking great for the BMW at this moment.\n\nIf you're interested, ordering books are already open but the first cars will be delivered towards the end of this summer.", "BMW has been often criticized that it offers a plethora of features and some of the most impressive tech in the business but is asking too much for it. As a matter of fact, a lot of people say that the most basic optional features you should get for free are not included on Bimmers.\n\nThat's not necessarily true, and BMW wants to offer more kit for the same bucks. In this regard, all cars sold in the UK starting with September 2015 will be having the Satellite Navigation system included as standard.\n\nStarting with July, the BMW Z4, BMW 2 Series Convertible and 2 Series Active Tourer will get the same feature as standard, ahead of the rest of the platoon. In September, even the 1 Series (the cheapest model in the range) will be available with Sat Nav from the get go.\n\nOther standard features that will be found on every model sold under the blue and white roundel in the UK include BMW Emergency Call, Digital radio and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nThis will be the basic BMW Navigation system though, not the Professional unit as you might've hoped. That means it comes with a 6.5-inch screen instead of the 8.8-inch one on the Navigation Professional version. Going for this alternative will also add the Touch controller along Real Time Traffic Information and BMW Online.\n\nThe move was received with praise by most people in the business, and it will seemingly force others to follow. According to Jeff Knight, Forecasting Editor Cars, CAP, BMW is the first mainstream manufacturer to make such a gesture that will dictate some changes in the industry.\n\nIf the likes of Mercedes-Benz or Audi will follow remains to be seen but in the meantime we're glad BMW went down this path and this is definitely good news for any customer.", "Recently, we reported that Volkswagen AG's current corporate management situation is brewing with some controversy amid unsatisfactory sales figures in recent times.\n\nNow, Volkswagen AG officially reports that their group chairman, Ferdinand Piech, was forced to resign from his position on the committee board. Piech's wife, who also had a position on the board, also resigned as well.\n\nThis is some pretty significant news because Ferdinand Piech has been an extraordinarily influential individual in the history of the Volkswagen AG empire. Piech's not only a grandson of the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, he was once the head of Audi in the 1980s and is heavily credited for growing the Ingolstadt automaker into a competitive luxury giant against Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nAs an engineer as well, he's responsible for designing Quattro all-wheel drive, the Audi 100, the Volkswagen New Beetle, the Audi, R8, the Lamborghini Gallardo, the Volkswagen Phaeton, and above-all, he was the mastermind behind the Bugatti Veyron. In 1993, he climbed his way to being the chairman and CEO of Volkswagen Group and all of their success since then, including the purchase and growth of Bentley, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Skoda, SEAT and the vertical integration of all those brands into the one major ladder-type portfolio of Volkswagen AG, was all under his direction.\n\nBasically, he literally is Mr. Volkswagen AG who lives, breathes and eats nothing more or less.\n\nBecause he is such an influential figure to be forced into leaving the company, this is undoubtedly a major industry story and is probably one that will be lingering for quite some time on our feeds.\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --", "Here we go again, with a case of: it was only a matter of time.

And because automakers are locked into a relentless sales war with each other, desperate bids to become the top-selling automaker in the world have led to desperate measures with them scrambling for the next big trend, if they haven't started it themselves.\n\nClick here for more news on the BMW X4.\n\nFor some odd reason, achieving the title for top-selling automaker crowns you superiority, simply because we've evolved into a society based on numbers. Whatever happened to the virtue of quality over quantity? Those days of handbuilt goodness and limited mass production are sorely missed. Though I digress...\n\nOne of those desperate measures has led to creating market segments that just do not exist in attempts to give buyers a little bit of everything. BMW is very much guilty of this, but really, you\n\ncan't blame their intuition of just constantly asking: \"what if...?\"\n\nLike, \"what if we made a 5-Series into an SUV,\" you get an X5 \"Sports Activity Vehicle.\" And we see how well that's worked for them. How about the 3-Series? Es ist kein Problem. Here's the X3. That's still alive and well. This has led to the cultivation of really interesting new concepts-one of them being the low-slung SUV crossover. Ok, \"what if we make the X5 less practical, give it a nice suit, charge more and call it the day?\" Verschleierte! You have the X6. This latest X4 is a byproduct of this cultivation, filling a gap of the compact luxury sports crossover between market segments with a healthy dollop of Bavarian creme. Establishing a market that's based on other famous recipes is a common occurrence with the Germans so the story with the X4 is all but different. Just like the X6, \"what if we took an X3 and...\" well, you know the rest.\n\nIn nearly the same exact fashion as to how the X6 came to be, the X4 was birthed, first in concept form at Auto Shanghai 2013-Don't forget, China is the world's largest and most potential car\n\nmarket at the moment. If you thought we love crossovers, don't also forget China is the most populous country in the world. Again, society of numbers. That said, take a 2015 X3, chop its rear off, rake its roofline, tweak things here and there, and throw in the towel. The result is actually something that you would call handsome. Except instead of resembling a less practical X3, it can be seen more as a 3-Series GT on stilts. Or an X6 mini-me. The profile is less boxy, more curvaceous, fulfilling the sentiments of less for more. And yet, the X4 still has all the creases and folds as other models.\n\nThe same notions of being a stylistically appointed and raised 3-Series GT carry on into the confines of the X4's passenger cell. Because the roofline is raked like the X6, head space still exists comfortably, even in the back. It's the trunk that loses its headroom and prevents any sort of tall objects from being stowed upright. You can put the seats down in typical 60/40 split, but just make sure it isn't some potted foliage, unless you want a trunk full of soil. Despite the slightly extra ride height, you still sit cocooned like you're in a 3-Series GT, making the X4 feel much sportier than the X3.\n\nBecause of the X4's 3-Series roots, the same selection of a turbocharged four-banger or inline-six for go power are on tap with the choice of rear-wheel drive or xDrive all-wheel. The lineup starts with a 2.0L TwinPower Turbo with 240hp and 260 lb-ft of twist for the xDrive28i and the admirable 3.0L TwinPower Turbo inline-six good for 300hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. We have the latter. Both of their transaxles consist of the ubiquitous ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhile the X4 does have a much higher center of gravity than the 3-Series GT, the boffins at Munich did what they do best. It doesn't feel much different than a more tightly sprung X3 to drive. The steering is decent with feel, though very accurate with good weighting and on-center feel. It's a BMW tiller, they're known for these things. In comparison with tillers of the past-we're not really here to argue that. Either way, it gets the job done with plenty to brag about and will meet expectations for The Ultimate Driving Machine.\n\nThere's not much more to the X4 except that it's the first to establish the market for a low-slung coupe-like crossover of its size. That said, Mercedes-Benz and Audi are more likely to follow up with their own competitors as well in order to get a piece of this new compact sports crossover pie. It will undoubtedly help the German automakers continue their onslaught of new models and product updates, all to become the world's top-selling automaker by sheer volume.", "Two men have been jailed after police found a sawn-off shotgun on the back seat of a BMW.\n\nEdward Ephraim, 32, of Lennard Road, Croydon, and Adrian McNeish, 32, of Mitford Walk, Crawley, were sentenced yesterday at Croydon Crown Court.\n\nEphraim pleaded guilty and was given six years for possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear or violence, and six year for possession of a prohibited weapon - to run concurrently.\n\nMcNeish, pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty and sentenced to nine years for possession of a prohibited weapon.

As Sean O'Shea reports, the wash owners are refusing to pay for repairs.\n\nRICHMOND HILL -- Helene Gooding and her husband Wayne are frustrated with an Oak Ridges car wash six weeks after a scrub and rinse left them with $600 in body damages.\n\nStory continues below\n\n\"This isn't right,\" said Gooding, angered that the owners of the Ultramar station on Yonge Street refused to pay the repairs to their car or even open a registered letter with a formal complaint.\n\nIn March, the Goodings took their 2013 Hyundai Elantra to the station and purchased gas. Afterward, they ran the vehicle through the automatic wash. But during the wash, Wayne Gooding said the vehicle \"hit something\" near the end.\n\n\"We started honking and honking and no one came,\" said Helene. Outside the wash, the couple inspected the damage: dents and scratches to the vehicle's front left bumper; the front hubcap was also broken.\n\nAfter speaking with the attendant, the couple contacted a manager and later spoke to the owner of the station, operated independently. They were denied compensation for the damage.\n\nWhen Global News went to the station to videotape the wash from the sidewalk, a manager called York Regional Police. An officer informed the manager that Global was acting within the law.\n\nLater, a brother of the owner spoke to Global News on camera. Awan Malik said the damage was \"the customer's fault 100 per cent\" and likely resulted because Gooding didn't properly put his left tire into the track of the automatic wash.\n\nMalik showed a Global News crew how it would be unlikely for the wash machinery to cause damage. He said, however, that the car wash does gladly pay for repairs to vehicles when it is the company's fault.\n\nGlobal News was told by a manager there were three complaints about damage at the car wash in March.\n\nThis isn't the only car wash where customers have reported sustaining damage to their vehicles.\n\nBarbara Hughes of North Vancouver, B.C. took her late-model BMW through a car wash in New Westminster when a spinning brush smashed the windshield and caused other damage, estimated at about $15,000. She was also denied compensation by owners of that wash.\n\nThe Goodings say they wanted other customers to be aware of the treatment at the Ultramar. They considered taking the owners to small claims court but determined that it would be too time-consuming.\n\n\u00a9 Shaw Media, 2015\n\nReport an error", "In the future, your car will anticipate your every need, from where you're heading to what you'd like to listen to along the way -- and, of course, drive itself.\n\nThat's the vision automakers are test-driving in Silicon Valley, which has emerged as ground zero in the race to re-imagine the automobile. Car companies ranging from General Motors to Mercedes have set up shop in the nation's hotbed of technology and innovation for a dose of inspiration -- and a little wheeling and dealing -- as they hash out how their vehicles will connect to the Internet, interact with users and drive autonomously.\n\nAnd with Apple and Google increasingly eyeing the road, they're shifting their efforts into overdrive.\n\nCars have remained comparatively low-tech as everything from phones to thermostats have undergone digital makeovers. But automakers can no longer deny that connected cars are the way of the future -- and they're pursuing the talent they need to engineer the shift, said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, a consulting firm in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBy focusing on Silicon Valley, automakers are \"almost unanimously admitting they don't have the internal resources to address the issue,\" he said. \"Those who do have the knowledge, insight and skills to address the issue are all in one village.\"\n\nCapped off by Ford's expansion earlier this year, most major automakers now have a presence in Silicon Valley. And even the early entrants have redoubled their efforts in recent years, transforming their Silicon Valley offices from far-flung research outposts to core arms of the company, said Chris Gerdes, who directs the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University. He credits Google -- whose cars routinely whir around sans drivers -- with giving the traditional automakers a sense of urgency.\n\n\"Companies are realizing that to get the most out of their Silicon Valley offices, they need more than just a few people,\" Gerdes said. \"They need to have an office that is doing exciting work and can compete for the very best talent the valley has to offer.\"\n\nThe pace of innovation is so brisk that some car companies project their vehicles will be running autonomously in at least some situations within the next five years. But when it comes to autonomous driving, honing the technology is just the beginning -- the real test will be how drivers react, said Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan Research Center Silicon Valley.\n\nAt Nissan's Sunnyvale, Calif., office, engineers are working on software for autonomous driving alongside a team of in-house anthropologists and sociologists whose mission is to ensure humans remain at the center of the design so they feel comfortable relinquishing the wheel, whether weaving through traffic in San Francisco or cruising through a neighborhood in Berkeley, Sierhuis said. Working with university partners, Nissan recently launched an ambitious research project to study how cultural norms for driving vary from place to place.\n\n\"You can't just rip out the steering wheel without understanding what that means,\" Sierhuis said.\n\nOutside the confines of their labs, automakers are capitalizing on their offices in the valley to form relationships with the tech industry's key players. BMW has a long track record of working with Apple and will have an app on the new Apple Watch, noted Uwe Higgen, who directs the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nHonda collaborates with tech companies large and small and recently opened a studio for developers in Mountain View. The release of Android Auto -- Google's platform for apps in cars -- and Apple's rival CarPlay has done much to spur developers' work on cars, said Nick Sugimoto, a senior program director at the Honda Silicon Valley Lab.\n\n\"Customers are really eager to get this in their cars,\" he said.\n\nAuto executives stationed in the Bay Area also act as their companies' eyes and ears in the valley, ensuring that they do not fall behind either the technological curve or the whims of modern drivers.\n\nAnd some automakers are even willing to look beyond the car. Ford is collecting data from cyclists to better understand bike usage, said Jim Buczkowski, Ford's director of Electrical and Electronics Systems for Research and Advanced Engineering. It helps the company prepare for a future in which city dwellers will seamlessly shift between various modes of transportation, perhaps driving their car to a train station, hopping aboard, and then mounting their bikes for the last leg of the journey, he said.\n\n\"We know that our cars and trucks are going to have to work very effectively with other forms of transportation to avoid congestion,\" he said.", "As the former owner of a Mercedes Benz mid-sized SUV, I thought I knew what German mid-size SUVs were all about.\n\nThen an Imperial Blue BMW X5 xDrive35d appeared in my driveway, and the joys of 0-60mph in 6.5 seconds mixed with 31-mpg in a vehicle capable of hauling big bunches of stuff were revealed.\n\nI was a bit surprised to find that in addition to the range of sedans and sportscars available from the Merchants of Munich you can also select from 16 different X models. There's an X1, X3, X4, X5, and an X6. One has to wonder what an X2 will look like.\n\nEven the X5 is broken down into four distinct models based on engine. While you can start at $53,900 for a 300-hp twin-turbo, in-line six, gas engine X535i, my tester used diesel fuel. The same engine configuration built for those fans of Dr. Otto Diesel's creation might only get 215 hp. but the 413 lb.-ft. of peak torque provide you with so much oomph off the starting line that you'll never miss the extra ponies.\n\nMy tester started at $56,600, and was optioned all the way up to $72,500. The EPA says you can expect 23-mpg city and 31-mpg highway. I was very pleased when I took a several- hundred-mile round trip and easily hit the 31-mpg mark.\n\nI also appreciated just how well the xDrive handled the snow, as my week of testing included snow storms. It was only one storm every other day that week. The X5 was equally at home in the dry, wet, ice, snow and whatever mix of these that Jack Frost threw at us. BMW's X5 didn't seem to care what the traction situation was, it just handled it.\n\nWhile there was a $1,700 optional third row of seats, I never used it. Instead I folded the middle row down and had a cargo space that got pressed into moving bicycles, bookcases, and several other items. It swallowed the cargo with no complaints.\n\nThe power rear hatch was useful, and the nine-inch-tall tailgate seemed almost like a vestigial throwback to the days when station wagons ruled the family-hauler market.\n\nThe front seats were exceptionally comfortable. Granted, they had the $1,300 multi-contour seat upgrade. But the basic design of the seat fit me very well. The addition of a front seat bottom extension only made my thighs that much happier for the support.\n\nSome folks are still reluctant to look at diesel-powered vehicles because of old prejudices. Yes, in the Seventies and Eighties, there were some slow, noisy, smelly diesel powered cars.

He now stands 18-8 this year and 7-1 on clay.\n\n\"I'm delighted with the win, especially since last week I won a tournament,\" Garcia-Lopez said. \"It's not easy, especially since I'm pretty tired. The first match of a tournament is always difficult and Anderson is a very aggressive player. I'm playing with confidence right now and hope to win another round or two.\"\n\nGarcia-Lopez's best Estoril showings were semi-finals in 2005 and 2010.\n\nSpain's Pablo Carreno Busta beat compatriot David Vega Hernandez, who replaced Robredo in the draw, 6-1, 6-2, while Croatian teenager Borna Coric outlasted the last Portuguese in the field, beating Rui Machado 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.\n\nISTANBUL OPEN\n\nBulgarian second seed Grigor Dimitrov on Thursday powered his way past Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan to breeze into the quarter-finals of the Istanbul Open.\n\nDimitrov closed out the match 6-3, 6-2 to keep himself on track for a meeting in the final on Sunday with top seed and world No. 2 Roger Federer, who eased into the quarter-finals the day earlier.\n\nGolubev, the world No. 117, never showed any sign of getting into the match, with Dimitrov always in control and able to complete his day's work in less than 1 hour, 5 minutes.\n\nLooking strong on his serve, world No. 11 Dimitrov offered his opponent no break points and won almost 90 percent of the points on his own serve.\n\nMeanwhile, Uruguayan third seed Pablo Cuevas made heavy work of Russian qualifier Teymuraz Gabashvili 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nThomaz Bellucci of Brazil knocked out Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan for a place in the quarters, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.\n\nBMW OPEN\n\nTop seed Andy Murray began his clay-court season with a routine 6-2, 6-2 victory over local qualifier Mischa Zverev to reach the BMW Open quarter-finals on Thursday.\n\nMurray saved all of six break points he faced, including three in the final game while serving for the match. He broke serve for a 2-1 lead in the second set and saved three break points in the next game before holding.\n\nZverev had little of the patience needed on clay, while Murray mixed his shots well.", "TORONTO - Sales of new cars and trucks climbed 5.7 per cent last month from a year ago, making it the best April on record for Canadian automakers, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants\n\nCanadians snatched up 189,072 vehicles last month, despite economic concerns in Western Canada stemming from low oil prices.\n\n\"The economic challenges facing Alberta and Saskatchewan have not seemed to impact national sales,\" the automotive consulting firm said in a report issued Friday.\n\nYear to date, sales are up 3.7 per cent to 557,645 vehicles.\n\nGeneral Motors led the pack, with its sales growing 14.5 per cent compared with April 2014 to 29,127 vehicles.\n\n\"Customer demand for our Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac cars and trucks continues to grow in the Canadian marketplace,\" John Roth, the company's vice-president of sales, service and marketing said in a statement.\n\n\"Our three truck strategy, offering the full range of pickups, from the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon to the full-size and heavy-duty, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to meet customers' varied needs, has driven GM Canada to be the pickup sales leader for the month of April.\"\n\nFiat Chrysler claimed second spot, with April sales inching one per cent higher to 27,473.\n\nFord Canada came in third place as sales dipped 0.1 per cent to 27,307 vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda saw sales tick 5.6 per cent higher to 14,447, while Hyundai's sales grew 1.5 per cent to 14,525 vehicles.\n\nToyota's sales fell by 2.8 per cent from a year ago to 18,495.\n\nLuxury vehicles recorded double-digit sales growth, with Porsche selling 47.8 per cent more vehicles while BMW's sales grew by 36.8 per cent.", "The Hollingsworth Race Team will showcase some of its collectible motorcycles at the 16th Annual Riding into History Motorcycle Concours.\n\nPod Rods takes a peek at the next Camaro, checks out who will drive the Indy 500 pace car, looks at some LeMons and checks out some classic BMWs at The Mitty.\n\nIt's all in Pod Rods, along with a complete calendar of automotive events...\n\nThe 16th Annual Riding into History Motorcycle Concours is rumbling its way to World Golf Village for its May 23 show, featuring \"Rule Britannia\" motorcycles and a special display from the Hollingsworth Race Team from St. Augustine.

The design shows a familiar roof line, but sleekly redesigned taillights as Chevy's design team says it set out to create a leaner, more athletic design.\n\n\"The Camaro went to the gym and came out with a lithe, more athletic physique for the sixth generation,\" GM Global Design VP Ed Welburn said. \"It's a more expressive evolution of the Camaro's iconic character - and one that complements its leaner size and sharper reflexes.\"\n\nCamaro's new design uses an aluminum hood with \"powerful, smoothly curved sculpted forms accented with sharp creases,\" Chevy said. The new Camaro retains the broad rear fenders that became a defining feature of the Gen 5 Camaro. The design is updated with greater detailing, including a subtle crease running parallel to the fender edge. Chevrolet will introduce the 2016 Camaro on Saturday May 16, during a special event at Detroit's Belle Isle Park.\n\nSpeaking of Chevrolet, five-time Brickyard 400 winner and four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Jeff Gordon will drive a Corvette Z06 pace car for the 99th running of the Indianapolis 500 mile race on May 24 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It is the 13th time a Corvette has served as the official pace car, dating to 1978. This is the 26th time a Chevrolet has led the pack, with a Corvette serving as the pace car more than any other vehicle in the race's history.\n\nGordon, who grew up in Pittsboro, Ind., won the inaugural Brickyard 400, and has visited the winner's circle there four more times.\n\n\"It's great to have Jeff Gordon serve as this year's pace car driver,\" said Jim Campbell, Chevrolet U.S. vice president of performance vehicles and motorsports. \"He is a true champion who has earned the respect and admiration of competitors and race fans alike. It will be very special to have Jeff lead the Indy 500 field to the green flag, behind the wheel of the most powerful and capable production car ever from Chevrolet - on a day he'll also be competing in the Coca Cola 600 NASCAR race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\"\n\nWith 650-hp, a supercharger and a seven-speed manual transmission, the production-spec Corvette Z06 pace car is done in Arctic White with and Adrenaline Red interior, plus an Indy graphics package and safety strobe lights.\n\nThere were no Gremlins, Pintos or Pacers there.\n\nBut the Concous d'LeMons at the 38th annual Speedfest at the Classic Motorsports Mitty at Road Atlanta did include a Triumph TR250 with a Corvette engine, a rusting Chevrolet Chevette, a 1959 Riley One-Point-Five, a 1984 Nissan pickup truck with a huge rear wing, and a BMW with a classic Chrysler Slant Six. Did I mention the Corolla with a Mazda rotary engine?\n\nWhile a concours d'elegance like the annual Amelia event celebrates the greatest car designs, the Concours d'LeMons states that is celebrates the \"Oddball, Mundane, and Truly Awful of the Automotive World!\" And during the 38th annual Speedfest at the Classic Motorsports Mitty at the famed Road Atlanta race track, 20 odd examples of the automotive world were on display.\n\nMitty grand marshal (and very tall racer) Boris Said was intrigued by the Nissan.\n\n\"I'm a big aerodynamic guy, and the way they worked out that pickup truck down there is pretty slick,\" Said said.\n\nThe crowd favorite was a 1986 Citroen Deux Chevaux with a custom Traction Avant-style nose and station wagon rear roof. Said folded his frame behind the wheel, then said he wished he could have gotten behind the wheel of some of the vintage race cars he'd seen on the track all weekend.\n\n\"There are some unbelievably beautiful cars here, and there are some unbelievably ugly cars here [at the Concours d'LeMons], so you definitely get A to Z here. It's a great event,\" Said said. \"I'm happy and sad. I am still racing and it is an honor to be a grand marshal, but it also means you are getting old in your career.\"\n\nAs far as the winners (??), Worst of Show was that 1981 Chevette, owned by Page Cooper, while the Rueful Britannia award went to Alan and Nancy Atwood's 1959 Riley and the Unmitigated Gaul award went to Steve Cripps' Citroen, The TR250 won the \"Most ill-advised but yet well executed engine swap\" award.\n\nThe event was sponsored by Hagerty classic car insurance.\n\nBMW was the featured marque all weekend long at the Mitty, and the company had a huge tent displaying some of its past and present race cars as well as its current line of sports cars. Part of its race support included supplying some interesting museum and race cars to pace an hour-long enduro with an all-BMW field.\n\nThe pace lap was led by multiple championship-winning racer Brian Redman in the 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\" that he and Ronnie Peterson won the championship. It was next to the Team Rahal-Letterman-Lanigan Z4 GTLM driven by Bill Auberlen and Dirk Werner in this year's Grand Am series.\n\n\"This year there are 60 more cars than last year, and 350 cars is very good. And to have BMW support the event is also excellent,\" Redman said. \".... There's a lot of work and a lot of money involved to bring the transporters and the people. There are six people from BMW Classic and public relations here. And they are really making the most of their success with this car from 40 years ago with Sebring and Daytona wins.\"\n\nLeading the parade lap was Said's 2005 BMW M3 Coupe race car, with a huge field of classic 3.0 CSLs, M3s and 2002 historic racers on the grid as Flowery Branch High School cheerleaders holding flags.\n\nThe riders of the Nitro Circus daredevil stunt show come to Autobahn Indoor Speedway the day before their first-ever May 8 show at the Veterans Memorial Arena.\n\nNitro Circus riders Ryan Williams, Ethen Roberts, Dusty Wygle and Gavin Godfrey will be available for a meet-and-greet from 6 to 8 p.m. at the indoor go-kart complex at 6601 Executive Park Court N., off Phillips Highway.

Then Carroll Shelby developed an FIA-homologated Mustang racing version called the Shelby GT350 competition model. Ol' Shel said two prototypes and 35 production models were built, although records show only 34 production models received serial numbers from the Shelby facility.\n\nIt's an intriguing pairing - the 707-hp Dodge Charger Hellcat and all-electric Tesla Model SP85D luxury sedan. But Motor Trend's \"Head 2 Head\" host Jonny Lieberman has decided to do a video comparison of the two big sedans and here's what he did and said, just for you.\n\nInfiniti held its inaugural Infiniti Design Night ahead of last week's Auto Shanghai 2015 at the Shanghai Himalayas Art Museum. And under the theme of \"Aesthetics of Contrast,\" Infiniti showcased three design concepts: the Q80 Inspiration (first shown in Paris, October 2014), Q60 Concept (Detroit, January 2015), and the Vision Gran Turismo designed especially for the latest Gran Turismo\u00ae 6 video game. This was the first time the Vision GT was displayed as a real concept car, having only been seen and experienced digitally in GT6 prior to this event. The Gran Turismo is a vision of what a high-performance Infiniti could look like in the future. Up front, the Infiniti Concept Vision Gran Turismo sports a sharp visage and a wide grille.\n\nChevrolet announced it will sell a special blacked-out edition of the Chevrolet Impala based on a concept shown at the 2014 SEMA Show in Las Vegas.\n\nArriving in dealerships early this summer, the Impala Midnight Edition gets a more dramatic, sinister look with a Jet Black exterior, including body color mirrors; 19-inch machine-faced aluminum wheels with black accents; black grille and surround; Jet Black interior; sport pedals; and black rear spoiler. Package prices range from $995 to $1,595 above the starting retail price with either the standard 2.5-liter four or 3.6-liter V-6.\n\nA bit of automotive engineering has given a British tortoise a new lease on life, and maybe some added speed in the process.\n\nIt seems that a rat chewed off the front legs of a tortoise named Mrs. T while she was hibernating. As this story and video in London's Telegraph newspaper shows, the roughly 90-year-old tortoise now boasts a pair of wheels taken from a model airplane. Using her rear legs (rear-wheel-drive?), she can get up quite some speed - for a tortoise. Check out Mrs. T in action.\n\nThis week's \"Jay Leno's Garage\" takes a look at a very rare and almost forgotten attempt at the little guy trying to take on Detroit with something innovative, and we don't mean the Tucker.\n\nThe three-wheeled 1948 Davis Divan was built by the Davis Motorcar Company near Los Angeles, just about 15 made from 1947 to 1948. Petersen Automotive Museum curator Leslie Kendall brought one of the aerodynamic convertibles over for Jay to ride and drive.\n\nHonda has a new crossover called the HR-V, with coupe-like styling and a claimed 35 mpg highway fuel economy rating.\n\nThe new HR-V hits dealerships nationwide on May 15 with standard 17-inch alloy wheels, push-button electric parking brake, rearview camera, Pandora\u00ae radio and Bluetooth HandsFreeLink. Base price - $19,115.\n\nThe crossover is powered by a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder 16-valve DOHC i-VTEC engine producing 141 hp and 127 lb.-ft. of torque through either a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or 6-speed manual transmission.\n\nFinally, let's take a sneak peek at some of the action in the upcoming James Bond film, \"Spectre,\" specifically a behind the scenes look at one of the eight specially-built Aston Martin DB10's being chased by the evil Mr. Hinx in the still-born Jaguar supercar, the C-X75.\n\nThe chase takes place at night on rain-slicked Roman roads, with some cool camera chase car action shots as well.\n\nSpringtime weather means lots of events on the car calendar:\n\nFlorida events:\n\n\uf06e\uf020St. Augustine Cruisers 13th annual Car and Truck Show -- 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, 207 N.

Most automaker sales suffer over winter, and April was a sign of stronger months to come. With the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate (SAAR) pegged at about 16.7 million vehicles by General Motors' analysts, 2015 still looks to be a reasonably strong year for new-car sales. In fact, many car companies set April sales records last month.And so, to the numbers ...1. General Motors: 269,056, up 5.9 percent.\n\n*Chevy Camaro was -23.6% to 6,909, versus the new Ford Mustang, +81.5% to 13,144 and Dodge Challenger +32% to 6,771.\n\n*Cheap gas is still helping big vehicles sell -- Silverado pickup +7.5% to 45,978, GMC Sierra +4.8% -- at the expense of small cars like the Chevrolet Cruze (-3.7%) and Spark (-3.4%).\n\n*Cadillac cars are struggling this year, with ATS -22.6% and CTS -47.2%, but sales of the Escalade and SRX SUVs keep climbing. 2. Ford Motor Company: 222,498, up 5.4 percent.\n\n*F-150 was -0.9% to 62,827 as the truck's sales continue to struggle, falling behind GM trucks (64,060 combined) but beating Chrysler's Ram (37,921).\n\n*Of those F-150 sales, Ford claims 63 percent had EcoBoost V-6 engines, and 60 percent were the high-zoot Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum trim levels.\n\n*The arrival of a new Ford Edge bumped sales +77.6% to 13,097, the nameplate's best-ever April sales result. 3. Toyota Motor Sales: 203,329, up 1.8 percent.\n\n*They may not be our favorites, but nothing can stop the Corolla (+10.1% to 31,990) and the Camry (-10.4% to 34,066) from winning the hearts and dollars of American shoppers. They are Toyota's two top-selling models.\n\n*Lexus saw its cars perform adequately (+2.6% to 13,425 sales), but it was the luxury brand's crossovers and SUVs that really pushed the needle, +23.5% to 12,451 sales. 4. Chrysler LLC: 139,239, down 1 percent.\n\n*Jeep sales continue to go from strength to strength. The brand was +20% to 71,759, led by the Cherokee (+27%, 19,072) and the Wrangler (+22%, 18,849).\n\n*Early Jeep Renegade sales look promising, as the car racks up 4,214 sales in April for a total of 5,157 since it launched.\n\n*Thirty-eight people bought an Alfa Romeo 4C last month!\n\n*Dodge brand sales -16% to 44,906 as Caravan (-54%), discontinued Avenger (-98% to just 140 sales), and Durango (-2%) hurt the overall total.5. American Honda: 130,068, down 1.8 percent.\n\n*CR-V crossover (+3.4% to 29,452) beat out Honda's popular cars, the Civic (+2.8% to 28,380) and the Accord (-20.1%to 27,251).\n\n*Acura brand sales rose 5.3 percent thanks to the new TLX sedan's 4,093 sales. Every other Acura model saw its sales decline last month; without the TLX, Acura sales would have fallen 23.6 percent. 6. Nissan North America: 109,848, up 5.7 percent.\n\n*As with most automakers, Nissan crossovers (+23.7%) steal the spotlight away from the company's cars (Altima -11.6%, Versa -8.0%, Maxima -23.1%). The Nissan Rogue, +44.5% to 21,767, is the second best-selling model behind the Altima midsize sedan (22,108 sales).\n\n*Infiniti sales are mostly stable, with the brand as a whole +8.8% to 9,979. Dark spots include the Q40 (-10.1% to 1,371), Q60 (-55.2% to 379), and QX50 (-17.8% to 185). 7. Hyundai: 68,009, up 2.9 percent.\n\n*Hyundai was one of several automakers to set an April sales record, and year-to-date the South Korean company has seen sales +6.2%.\n\n*Elantra leads in volume, +8.3% to 21,911, followed by Sonata -12.6% to 17,914 sales.8. Kia Motors America: 53,282, down 0.7 percent.\n\n*Most models saw sales slip last month. Bright spots were the Sedona minivan, Sorento crossover, and Sportage crossover. 9. Subaru: 47,241, up 17.9 percent.\n\n*Sporty coupes are a tough sell. BRZ sales -39.8% to just 494, and year-to-date the BRZ is -42.7%. The Subaru's twin, the Scion FR-S, is also struggling, with sales -29.0% to 1,026.\n\n*The new Legacy and Outback are posting big gains over the outgoing versions, +68.8% to 5,276 and +17.6% to 12,534 respectively. 10. Daimler-Benz: 32,432, up 10.6 percent.\n\n*The Mercedes-Benz C-Class remains the top seller, +30.3% to 6,665.\n\n*Among crossovers, the M-Class remains the kind, +29.1% to 4,945 sales, with the GLK-Class trailing at 3,071, -2.3%.\n\n*The new Mercedes-AMG GT found 205 buyers in its first month on sale. 11. BMW Group: 32,428, up 9.6 percent.\n\n*The 3-Series and 4-Series family remains the volume leader, +5.9% to 10,374 sales.\n\n*Mini Hardtop sales continue to rise this year, with two-door models +77.7% to 2,141 last month.\n\n*BMW is one of the few automakers to see its crossover sales fall, -4.1% to 7,938, even with the addition of the new X4. 12. Volkswagen: 30,009, down 2.67 percent.\n\n*The high-performance Golf GTI (+97.2% to 1,905) outsold the standard Golf (+109.0% to 1,739), the Golf R (327), and the e-Golf (309).\n\n*But nothing can touch the Jetta sedan, +5.4% to 11,440, and the Passat midsizer, -28.9% to 6,623. 13. Mazda: 24,123, up 26.1 percent.\n\n*Only two models improved their sales and kept Mazda's numbers in the black: The Mazda6 sedan, +30.9% to 4,995, and the Mazda CX-5 crossover, +31.1% to 8,960. Both of those models recently received significant refreshes.\n\n*No surprises that sales of the old MX-5 Miata are down, -17.4% to 384, but it's more of a shock the popular Mazda3 compact is -6.8%, finishing the month with 8,006 sales.14. Audi: 16,827, up 7.5 percent.\n\n*The Audi A3 (+47.6% to 3,187) and the Q5 (+14.2% to 3,762) led in terms of volume, as Audi celebrated its 52nd consecutive month of increased U.S. sales.\n\n*Whether it's because the model is so old or because buyers are switching to the A3, sales of the A4 are -26.5% to 2,327. One year ago, A4 sales outpaced those of the A3, but the tables have since turned.15. Mitsubishi: 8,216, up 25.5 percent.\n\n*Don't count Mitsubishi out just yet. Sales are up so far this year, thanks almost entirely to growth of the Mirage (+80.8% to 2,407) and steady sales of the Outlander Sport (+2.1% to 2,674).16. Jaguar Land Rover North America: 6,390, up 15 percent.\n\n*Land Rover doesn't break down sales by models, but last month the brand's sales were +17% to 5,311 units\n\n*Jaguar sales were +4% to 1,079, with the XF sedan leading the volume +16% at 484 units. The F-Type sports car is +198%, but that only translated to 274 sales versus a paltry 92 in April 2014.loo17. Porsche: 5,217, up 28.1 percent\n\n*Here, too, crossovers reign supreme. The Boxster, Cayman, and 911/918 sports cars collectively racked up 1,522 sales last month. But the Porsche Macan managed 1,537 and the Cayenne posted 1,773.18. Volvo: 4,381, down 5.5 percent.\n\n*The only cars with sales gains were the S80 luxury sedan, +8.0% to just 121 sales, and the XC60 crossover, +44.0% to 1,819. The new-for-2015 V60 CC posted 313 sales, only slightly trailing the standard V60 wagon's 400 sales.Compact cars, April sales:\n\n1.) Toyota Corolla 31,990\n\n2.) Honda Civic 28,380\n\n3.)

Appropriating the mashed-up visual language of the internet and combining their own original photography, Mazaccio & Drowilal's images evoke the feeling of real-life Tumblr. These are compositions that have as much a place on a cluttered desktop overrun with JPEGs as they do on a gallery wall. For \"Wild Style,\" the pair explore the representation and commodification of animals in contemporary culture. From lawn flamingoes to wolf T-shirts to stuffed tigers and animal print fabric, Mazaccio & Drowilal's images juxtapose the idea of living creatures with their manmade counterparts. Like a pig selling bacon, it's as if mankind's conservation efforts are reduced to marketing concepts presented in preparation of inevitable animal extinction. Buy a keychain to save the rhino, and remember that this once existed. While it's tough to see the darkness in their colorful work, it's there -- masked in humor.\n\nFor \"Ant\u00e9pisode,\" Mazaccio & Drowilal display portrait-style pictures and subsequently reduce them to emoji. This reduction is next-level handholding for the novice viewer, and while the intent of the series is to explore \"the roots of IT and digital companies in Silicon Valley, California\" through physical spaces, that concept is generally lost. What we are left with is a range of work embodying bits of California; palm trees, watermelons and strawberries, kitesurfing, and balance balls -- which yes, were ushered into the office space by web developers and those looking for a healthier seating option in front of a computer.", "Bore friends and family to tears with remote light and horn demonstrations\n\nThere's nothing worse than having to fumble around in your pockets for a set of cars keys while your Apple Watch is ringing off the hook with incoming emails, Tweets and calendar alerts.\n\nIt may be the dictionary definition of a #firstworldproblem, but Porsche and BMW have decided to tackle the pressing issue head-on.

When it was introduced, the 1 Series raised a few concerns, especially with the conservative BMW customer group in more ways than one. Some even went as far as stating it will be a failure even before it's sales started. They were wrong. And we are glad they were.\n\nThe BMW 1 Series brings a dash of luxury, performance and a great premium feeling to the hatchback world. It features well-known BMW build quality, alongside performance and efficiency oriented engines. All depending on what the customer really wants for their vehicles. It also translated well into the premium segment, offering the upper middle class of buyers the potential to satisfy their daily driving needs or simply purchase a brand new BMW vehicle for their children or spouses, encouraging them to instill loyalty to the luxury car brand from the early age for all of them.\n\nWith the introduction of the brand new BMW 1 Series, the lackings of the previous incarnation of this successful luxury hatchback were rectified. The design aspects were gradually changed. New visual key areas were added. New models and equipment ranges as well. There are a few highly efficient engines available, but one performance oriented solution stands as the most alluring one there. At the top of the petrol engine range remains the formidable M135i with its turbocharged straight-six engine. Power has been increased in the new model to 326hp, with peak torque of 450Nm, enabling a 0-62mph time of just 4.9 seconds, yet the ability to return 37.7mpg.\n\nBMW United Kingdom has released several images, showcasing the BMW M135i in Sapphire Black, Alpine White and Estoril Blue. All of these finishes applied to the BMW 1 Series of the current generation can be viewed in the media gallery we've added below. All of the images are added in a gorgeous wallpaper sized images as well.", "Convertibles have dipped to only 1 percent of the new car market, down from 5 percent a decade ago. Yet drop-tops occupy a far greater place in our hearts. Automakers know this, and are trying to reverse the retreat with a handful of new models for 2015. The new crop will tug at our tops and add to the nearly two dozen existing models that will open up the possibilities for a sealed off segment.\n\nConvertibles are emotional purchases, as varied as their owners. According to Buick, sales are split 60 percent male and 40 percent female. Drivers have higher incomes -- primarily because luxury marques dominate.\n\n\"For most of these consumers, this is an additional vehicle in the garage -- a reward for hard work,\" said Rob Peterson, Buick marketing manager. \"They are looking for a fun vehicle -- something that is spirited and gives them that excitement of an open air vehicle.\"\n\nThis passion takes many forms: Inexpensive or expensive, two or four seats, hardtop or soft-top, high speed or off-road. Which you choose doesn't really matter.\n\n\"There's nothing more fun than a road trip with wind in your hair, listening to music, hearing the exhaust, and enjoying sunlight,\" said Andrew Weber, Midwest Sports Car Club founder. \"It doesn't matter if it is a sports car or not. Jeep is a good example. With the top off, it's always going to be fun.\"\n\nNewbies\n\nIn 1976, Cadillac billed the Eldorado as the last American convertible. It was, until Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca ordered the tops off LeBarons, tapping into Americans' love for convertibles.\n\nWhile FCA now sells the topless Jeep Wrangler, Fiat 500 and Alfa 4C, it no longer offers a midsize convertible -- a descendant of the best-selling LeBaron/Sebring.\n\nBuick is taking up that space by rolling out the four-seat Cascada.\n\n\"There is a void in the premium touring convertible space today,\" Peterson said. \"There are very expensive luxury convertibles as well as sport car convertibles. But there are very few that provide the ride quality, features, style and value like Cascada.\"\n\nBuick drops it in a hot 17 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph while sporting 20-inch wheels and a 200 horsepower turbo-four engine. Safety bars deploy during rollovers. Expect prices starting around $35,000.\n\nWhile Cascada exploits a void in the market, enthusiasts embrace the redesigned 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata and Alfa Romeo 4C Spider.\n\n\"The MX-5's focus has always been on driver and passenger enjoyment,\" said Rod McLaughlin, Mazda MX-5 product line manager. \"The MX-5 reinvigorated the roadster segment when it debuted at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show. Today, it provides a combination of features, quality and performance at a price point no competitors can match.\"\n\nThe sexier Miata is enlivened with an aluminum-intensive body and 155 horsepower four-cylinder engine. Sales commence this summer with prices around $25,000.\n\nAlfa Romeo's 4C Spider employs a carbon fiber chassis and midmounted engine to optimize performance.\n\n\"Passion, racing tradition, technology, and exotic Italian design are some of the attributes most fondly expressed by enthusiasts in North America,\" said Richard Cox, Director of Alfa Romeo Brand North America. \"The 4C Spider plays to these strengths and sets the foundation going forward.\"\n\nBMW is also updating the 6-Series convertible. Revised styling with LED headlamps accompanies a choice of twin-turbo V-8 or turbo V-6 engines. Or, enjoy the M6's 560 horsepower twin-turbo V-8.\n\nThe contenders\n\nWhatever your price point, there are fun convertibles.\n\nLeast expensive are the Euro-chic Smart ForTwo ($17,930) and Fiat 500 ($20,145). The Mini Cooper ($25,700), updated BMW 2-Series ($37,900) and Audi A3 ($35,600) add space and content.\n\nGerman automakers dominate premium segments. If you want four seats, check out the Mercedes-Benz E-Class ($61,350) or BMW 4-Series ($48,750). Compact roadsters are represented by the stylish Audi TT ($42,900), BMW Z4 ($48,950), and Mercedes SLK ($43,950) -- the latter two with retractable hardtops.\n\nCelebrating 60 years since the race that launched the car, Mercedes will offer its benchmark SL550 \"Mille Miglia 417,\" highlighted by night black paint and red trim. Prices TBD.\n\nOr, roll large in a Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe. It costs at least $474,600, more for the exclusive Nighthawk edition. The Bentley GTC ($195,200) is a swell alternative.\n\nCamaro, Corvette and Mustang bat for America.\n\nFifty years after the original, Mustang ($29,300) flaunts muscular style and independent rear suspension. Engines include a 310 horsepower EcoBoost four-cylinder, V-6 and 435 horsepower V-8.\n\nCamaro ($32,200) matches Mustang, but unbottles the evil ZL1's 580 horsepower supercharged V-8. Get a base 455 horsepower Corvette ($55,995) or the divine 650 horsepower Z06 ($79,995).\n\nAmong all these, who could not cuddle a VW Beetle ($25,595)?\n\nThe same might not be said about the Range Rover Evoque convertible; the odd luxury compact crossover drop-top goes to market in 2016.\n\nThe Miata effect\n\nA quarter-century ago, Miata reignited our love affair with convertibles.\n\n\"The MX-5's focus has always been on driver and passenger enjoyment,\" said McLaughlin. \"The MX-5 reinvigorated the roadster segment when it debuted at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show.

When it entered the sports sedan class, Cadillac knew comparisons to BMW's M3 and 4 were a given, and with the entrance of the 2016 ATS-V, it's pretty much all anyone can talk about.\n\nAmerica versus Germany debate aside, what makes this ATS-V so special? For a 3.6 liter twin-turbocharged V6, the Cadillac is more robust and race-ready than the M3, for starters. The ATS-V's 464 horse-power engine is 40 more than the M3, and it does the zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds, according to Motor Authority.\n\nNot quite the 3.7 seconds of the Dodge Charger Hellcat, which was reviewed in the Inquisitr last week, but this is a different class, after all. Still, the carnivorous V6 engine of the ATS-V cranks out power just like a V8, with the track times to show for it.\n\nWith speeds up to 189 miles per hour, the lightweight carbon fiber front splitter, hood vent, and rear diffuser reduce mass and increase aerodynamics for a powerful yet smooth experience on the track. Compared to the M3, the Cadillac's power, handling, and driver feedback are slightly more spot-on.\n\n\"As the smallest and lightest V-Series ever, the ATS-V forges a great connection with the driver, with exceptional nimbleness and responsiveness. It's adaptable to the driver's preferences, with every selectable mode developed to deliver the best performance for all types of driving scenarios, including the track,\" said Cadillac Executive Chief Engineer David Leone.\n\nThe all-new 2016 ATS-V is ergonomically designed to enhance driver comfort and control #ATS #VSERIES pic.twitter.com/vdbZs7xnr0\n\n-- Cadillac (@Cadillac) April 15, 2015\n\nThe ATS-V is fine-tuned to meet luxury and performance perfectly, perhaps better than anything Europe has to offer. The abundant acceleration and power delivery are combined with a top of the line interior that matches the M3.\n\nIf Cadillac was aiming for a vehicle that's race-ready, but that also can be driven comfortably every day, it's hit a win with the rear-wheel drive 2016 ATS-V. With the vehicle's accessible but not necessary track-ready features, the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V delivers a balanced performance. And no worries: It comes with the Performance Data and Video Recorder, similar to the one in the Corvette, so you can video your drive in high-definition.\n\nThis animal goes from work to play seamlessly, as capable on hairpin turns as it is on the straight. Use the Cadillac's Wet mode to gain more traction in sloppy weather, or fishtail to your heart's content.\n\nThe 2016 Cadillac ATS-V is priced right in line with its European counterparts; $61,460 gets you into the driver's seat of the sedan, and the coupe starts at $63,660.", "Duration: 00:41s - Published: 4 days ago\n\nEarlier this month, Nissan and BMW issued simultaneous recalls affecting nearly 100,000 U.S.-registered vehicles. In both cases, the underlying problem was a faulty fuel pump made by German supplier, Bosch. Now, the Bosch recall has expanded to include thousands of additional vehicles from a completely different car company, Volkswagen. The German automaker has recalled Volkswagen Golf, GTI, and Audi A3 vehicles from the 2015 model year.", "The order books are now open for the 2016 Cadillac CTS-V, which officially goes on sale this summer priced from $84,990, including a $995 destination charge. That's a lot of coin for a General Motors Company [NYSE:GM] product but recall that you're getting a luxurious, lightweight sedan that also happens to pack a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 churning out a massive 640 horsepower and 630 pound-feet of torque.\n\nThat makes the CTS-V one of the fastest four-doors on the planet, with Cadillac's performance estimates for the car including a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 200 mph. Taking into account the combination of performance, luxury and cabin space, the only real alternatives are BMW's M5 and Mercedes-Benz's E63 AMG, both of which start above $90k.\n\nAnd the Cadillac is much better equipped than its rivals straight out of the box thanks to its carbon fiber hood, 19-inch wheels wrapped with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, 20-way adjustable front seats with heating and ventilation, camera monitoring, and suede and carbon fiber trim.\n\nAnd there's plenty of advanced technology, too, such as the dual-clutch-trumping 8L90 eight-speed automatic transmission, third-generation magnetic ride control suspension damping, fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation, performance data recorder, and Cadillac's CUE infotainment system.\n\nAs Cadillac chief Johan de Nysschen explains, this segment leading position is one we'll see repeated in future V-series products.

Just send me an e-mail at Letters2Doug@gmail.com, or Tweet me at @DougDeMuro. All names will be changed to protect the question asker, in case you want to admit something embarrassing, like the fact that you bought the current Volkswagen Passat. We call this the DeMuro-Client Privilege.\n\nToday's question comes to us from a reader named Clarence. Of course, Clarence isn't actually his name, because nobody is named Clarence anymore, sort of like how nobody is named \"Ballaban.\" But anyway: \"Clarence\" lives in the Los Angeles area, and he's trying to buy a limited-production new car. He writes:\n\nHey Doug,\n\nI have been going through some frustrations lately trying to buy a new car. I understand it's against the Jalop way but still. I am cross shopping a GT350R and a Cayman GT4 but I can't seem to get any dealer to do away with the markup. Do you have any tips on getting a limited production car at MSRP or less?\n\nThanks\n\nClarence\n\nFor those of you who don't know what Clarence is talking about, allow me to explain the situation with rare, limited-production vehicles. When manufacturers produce these vehicles, one of two things happens: either a) the car is an enormous success and the dealers charge a markup, or b) the car is a huge flop, and the dealers burn them in order to collect insurance money.\n\nIn recent years, we've seen examples of both. For instance: just two a few short years ago, BMW debuted a high-performance coupe called the \"1 Series M,\" and assumed that nobody would buy it, because BMW's recent strategy has primarily involved creating smooth, luxurious hatchback versions of everything in sight, including the coffee machine in the service department waiting lounge.\n\nSo BMW only made a limited run of these cars. But then it turned out there are still people who like to drive BMWs, and not simply place big things in the enlarged rear ends of the hatchback models, so the demand for this thing was off the charts. So off the charts, in fact, that BMW dealers were marking them up ten and twenty grand above the factory retail price in order to earn the sweet, sweet profit that BMW didn't think was there. In fact, three years later, these things are still going for MSRP, even after they've done more track days than the Marussia F1 team.\n\nBut then, on the other end of the spectrum, you have the Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet, which was essentially a Nissan Murano attempting impersonate a Chrysler Sebring convertible. What happened here was, Nissan decided to offer the Murano with a convertible top and only two doors, and then they decided to charge $45,000 for each one, even though all relevant market research suggested that customers would actually rather chew off their own thumbs.\n\nSo these all ended up going for well under MSRP, and I am told that Nissan dealers stuck with leftover models are now trying to weld fixed roofs back on and add two more doors, because that'll be \"cheaper than trying to sell these pieces of crap.\"\n\nSo now we return to Clarence's question, which is: when you're faced with a limited-production car like the Cayman GT4 or the Shelby GT350R, how do you avoid the markup?\n\nWell, Clarence, here's the thing about supply and demand: when supply is low and demand is high, people will sometimes pay ridiculous money in order to get things. If you need any proof of this, head over to Zillow and check out Manhattan real estate. You will find approximately ten zillion listings priced between $1 and $2 million, including roughly three with a functional washer and dryer.\n\nCars are the same way. The Cayman GT4 and the new Shelby GT350R are two of today's hottest vehicles, which means you're competing against a long line of people for what will likely amount to less than 2,000 cars. In this case, the people who pay markups get the cars, and the people who don't will have to wait.\n\nAnd so, Clarence, you have two basic choices: either you'll have to wait, or you'll have to pay. Because when it comes to low-volume, high-demand cars, the \"MSRP\" should simply be ignored. It's an irrelevant figure; an arbitrary number that has no real basis in fact. As businesses, dealers are free to charge whatever the market will bear, and believe me when I say that they will. And you, as the consumer, will haggle with them, even if they've priced the car at $9.25 and a glass of Diet Coke. (\"Does the glass have to be FULL?\") This is the way of life in the car business.\n\nIn other words: don't think of the markup as a markup at all: think of it as the actual market price, set by supply, demand, and a bunch of crazy rich people who want to one-up their neighbor who merely has a Cayman GTS. If you don't want to fork over the cash, so be it: you'll go home happy that you didn't spend \"too much\" on a new car. But the people who sucked it up and paid the markup will go home happier. Because they have a brand-new sports car in the garage.", "It is wonderful to see Volvo shedding its image of being the maker of boxy vehicles. Even though the company has always fitted its products with the latest technology that the automobile industry has to offer, Volvo cars have simply looked too bland to entice young buyers. The Swedish company does have the reputation of manufacturing some of the safest cars around, but it sorely needed some magic to redeem its image. This it achieved with the launch of the S60. It showed the world that Volvo was no longer a predictable car maker that everyone thought it was. The S60 is one of the most radical-looking sedans in the market and has infused a sporty vision into the Chinese-owned Swedish company.\n\nThe latest avatar of the S60 comes with a new and powerful 4-cylinder, 2-litre diesel engine. But Volvo, not satisfied with a new power block under the hood, has made the S60 bolder in its look, as evidenced by its \"R Design\". The S60 R Design is by far the most striking sedan in the entry-level luxury segment. Bathed in light blue, it stands out on the road and has an arresting presence.\n\nIn the new compact executive sedan, Volvo has gone with a flowing coupe-like design, which gives the car an aggressive profile. The three-box shape of the vehicle has been beautifully crafted. If there is a bone to pick in terms of design, then it has to be the rear windows, which shrink in size drastically due to the sloping roofline. The wider and all-black front grille gives the S60 a more imposing look, while the R Design kit brings in a lot of goodies like more muscular bumpers, outside rear-view mirrors painted in silver - which in my opinion exquisitely complements the blue colour - and at the rear, tail lamps resembling a Tomahawk, a native American axe. If that is striking, then there's more. The S60's dual, chrome-finished exhausts are wonderfully housed in a silver lower bumper. I have always loved the looks of this wedge-shaped sedan and it continues to impress me without even trying. I have to admit the new 18-inch low-profile wheels really sex up the S60's dynamic profile even further.\n\nBeyond all this beauty, how does the new diesel engine fare? Fire it up and there is quite an audible diesel rattle. Don't mistake me, nowadays diesel engines are tuned for comfort and are so refined that they lack character. Given this, the S60's grunt is music to the ears. My pleasure is accentuated by the rude jerk that the car's Drive-E power plant gives me when I press the accelerator. Now, we are talking - the engine's ponies start galloping even before I can settle down nice and proper. It is evident that the extra 15 horse power have made a serious difference from the earlier model. With 178 bhp under the hood, which is more than in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class and just a fraction less than in the BMW 3-Series, the car is very agile and quick off its feet. And if the Pied Piper lured the rats out of Hamelin, the S60's new eight-speed gearbox may similarly tempt buyers in droves, for with the low ratios it changes gears precisely, making the car quick to accelerate while easy to handle in city conditions. What is worth noting is whether on the highway or in crawling traffic, the power delivery is right on the dot and never leaves you praying for more juice. I would have preferred the gear shift to be slightly quicker, but then it's not a BMW.\n\nSince the S60 is not a rear-wheel drive like most of its German rivals, it does not go berserk in handling. It remains planted and feels solid as a rock. It does not shy away from taking on the curves and it does all these without understeering and making the hair at the back of your neck stand up. What is important is that the car ensures you know you are in total control. The ride quality can be quite unforgiving as the stiff suspension and the low-profile tyres make you sense every bump on the road. I suppose that is the sacrifice you have to make if you want to go all sporty.\n\nI left the discussion on the interiors till the last. The S60 comes with fabulous seats that provide excellent support and hug the body tightly. And even though Volvo will insist the sedan is a 5-seater, I would suggest that you ask the fifth passenger to walk! The rear seats are carved to provide great comfort, but will not please three people there. What is more, with the sloping roofline, they have to mind their heads while getting in. The simple all-black and aluminium inserts look classy, though the design now comes across as more functional than luxurious. It is perhaps time for Volvo to up its game in the cabin, especially since its Mercedes-Benz counterpart, the C-Class, now resembles the legendary S-Class.\n\nDoes the Volvo S60 R Design have the cojones to take on the German trinity? It does when it comes to power, styling, comfort and safety but falls behind when it's about exuding an air of invincibility. The S60 falls in the same price bracket as the C-Class, that is, in the region of Rs 40 lakh. This pricing will probably go against it, but if style is your game and you don't want to be an owner of a German car, then you can well stand apart with the S60.\n\nVOLVO S60 R DESIGN\n\nEngine: 1,969 cc\n\nPower: 178 bhp @ 4250 rpm\n\nTorque: 400 Nm @ 1750-2500 rpm\n\nPrice: Rs 40.25 lakh (Ex-showroom, New Delhi)\n\nIt is wonderful to see Volvo shedding its image of being the maker of boxy vehicles.

I have to admit the new 18-inch low-profile wheels really sex up the S60's dynamic profile even further.\n\nBeyond all this beauty, how does the new diesel engine fare? Fire it up and there is quite an audible diesel rattle. Don't mistake me, nowadays diesel engines are tuned for comfort and are so refined that they lack character. Given this, the S60's grunt is music to the ears. My pleasure is accentuated by the rude jerk that the car's Drive-E power plant gives me when I press the accelerator. Now, we are talking - the engine's ponies start galloping even before I can settle down nice and proper. It is evident that the extra 15 horse power have made a serious difference from the earlier model. With 178 bhp under the hood, which is more than in the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class and just a fraction less than in the BMW 3-Series, the car is very agile and quick off its feet. And if the Pied Piper lured the rats out of Hamelin, the S60's new eight-speed gearbox may similarly tempt buyers in droves, for with the low ratios it changes gears precisely, making the car quick to accelerate while easy to handle in city conditions. What is worth noting is whether on the highway or in crawling traffic, the power delivery is right on the dot and never leaves you praying for more juice. I would have preferred the gear shift to be slightly quicker, but then it's not a BMW.\n\nSince the S60 is not a rear-wheel drive like most of its German rivals, it does not go berserk in handling. It remains planted and feels solid as a rock. It does not shy away from taking on the curves and it does all these without understeering and making the hair at the back of your neck stand up. What is important is that the car ensures you know you are in total control. The ride quality can be quite unforgiving as the stiff suspension and the low-profile tyres make you sense every bump on the road. I suppose that is the sacrifice you have to make if you want to go all sporty.\n\nI left the discussion on the interiors till the last. The S60 comes with fabulous seats that provide excellent support and hug the body tightly. And even though Volvo will insist the sedan is a 5-seater, I would suggest that you ask the fifth passenger to walk! The rear seats are carved to provide great comfort, but will not please three people there. What is more, with the sloping roofline, they have to mind their heads while getting in. The simple all-black and aluminium inserts look classy, though the design now comes across as more functional than luxurious. It is perhaps time for Volvo to up its game in the cabin, especially since its Mercedes-Benz counterpart, the C-Class, now resembles the legendary S-Class.\n\nDoes the Volvo S60 R Design have the cojones to take on the German trinity? It does when it comes to power, styling, comfort and safety but falls behind when it's about exuding an air of invincibility. The S60 falls in the same price bracket as the C-Class, that is, in the region of Rs 40 lakh. This pricing will probably go against it, but if style is your game and you don't want to be an owner of a German car, then you can well stand apart with the S60.\n\nVOLVO S60 R DESIGN\n\nEngine: 1,969 cc\n\nPower: 178 bhp @ 4250 rpm\n\nTorque: 400 Nm @ 1750-2500 rpm\n\nPrice: Rs 40.25 lakh (Ex-showroom, New Delhi)\n\nArup Das is Features Editor at AutoX", "Some companies that tend to divide the analyst community.

However, despite a seven per cent year-on-year volume growth and 14 per cent sales growth in the March quarter, some analysts believe the company has disappointed and will not be able to capture higher market share as indicated earlier.\n\nThough TVS Motor is expected to launch two new platforms by the first half of FY16, the Street is not confident about the company's ability to increase marketshare, as rivals such as Hero and Bajaj have not managed to hold on to theirs in the face of Honda's launches. Emkay Global remains \"slightly cautious about the very high optimism in the Street surrounding TVS' new launches\". Currently, the top five brands in the space control 60 per cent of the market. Analysts also believe the company's Jupiter, Star City Plus and Zest are losing steam.\n\nThe firm has indicated that it intends to take its marketshare up from 13.2 per cent to 15 per cent in FY16, implying a volume growth of 12-15 per cent. Reliance Securities, however, expects the firm to grow volumes by 12 per cent on the back of the launch of the new Apache and TVS Victor. In addition, launching a 300-cc motorcycle with BMW would further aid volumes. The more optimistic analysts expect the company to grow exports by 22 per cent compounded annual growth rate over FY15-17, as it enters new markets and launches new products.\n\nThe margin is another area where the market differs. The company exited FY15 with operating margin of 6.6 per cent even though the management continues to believe it will hit double digits by FY17. However, there was a one-time adjustment, which impacted margins. After adjusting this, margins stood at 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe company's investment in subsidiaries and operating losses at the Indonesian subsidiary are expected to continue in FY16, too, which would be a drag. Analysts believe even if TVS manages to grow volumes and expand margins, it currently trades at 21 times its FY16 earnings, which is expensive.", "LATEST REGISTRATIONS -- PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY RAMPS UP LOBBYING: PhRMA has added The Strategy Group Inc. to its roster of lobbyists, according to Senate lobbying disclosures.

The two basic loss-of-traction events are referred to as understeer (plowing) and oversteer (spin out). An example of understeer is driving straight down an icy road and turning left or right to avoid an obstruction. Because of the lack of traction at the front wheels, the vehicle will continue traveling in a relatively straight line, ignoring the direction of the driver's steer. Oversteer is a loss of traction at the rear wheels, driving straight on a slippery, wet, road surface, and attempting an abrupt hard turn. The front tires grab, but the rears don't, causing the rear end to slide sideways, potentially resulting in a 180-degree spin.\n\nEither loss-of-traction event (or a combination of the two) can lead to a collision or rollover crash. Rollovers most often occur when a loss of control causes the vehicle to veer off the roadway, then \"trip\" on a curb, soft shoulder, and so on. Untripped rollovers are much less common, less than 5 percent according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and come about with top-heavy vehicles and/or an overly aggressive maneuver with good traction.\n\nESC is a great safety concept, which does save lives. As of model-year '12, all U.S.-bound vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or less are required to have an ESC system. The NHTSA predicts that offering ESC on all vehicles may annually save 5,300-9,600 lives and prevent 156,000-238,000 injuries.\n\nSo let's take a look at how ESC works and how it was developed.\n\nWe'll start off with the anti-lock braking system (ABS). It may seem unrelated but quite the opposite is true. ABS actually began in 1929 with a fully mechanical version used on aircraft landing gear. Experimental versions were slowly applied to motorcycles and automobiles through the '50s and '60s, but Chrysler and the Bendix Corporation developed the first modern (electronic) ABS system with production of the '71 Imperial. The rest of the industry eventually followed suit.\n\nThe key to electronic ABS was the installation of wheel speed sensors, which report to the electronic control unit (ECU). The ECU receives individual speed inputs from all four wheels, as opposed to just one reading from the transmission indicating vehicle speed. With this data, the ECU predicts the instant a tire is about to lock up (skid) when the brakes are applied. The ECU immediately responds with commands to hydraulic valves and a fluid pump to control brake pressure at each wheel independently. By reducing the brake pressure (in a pulsing, high-speed process), each wheel will continue to spin at a determined low rate of speed and maintain traction. In most circumstances, ABS can reduce stopping distance, but its principal benefit is maintaining steering control during loss of traction while hitting the brakes.\n\nA bit more trivia: ever heard of MaxTrac? This was the earliest stage of an electronic traction control system (TCS) implemented by Buick on the full-size, rear-wheel-drive '71 Riviera. MaxTrac used an ECU with inputs from a left-front wheel speed sensor and a transmission speed sensor to compare the front-to-rear wheel speed difference. When the ECU detected higher wheel speed (wheel spin) from the rear axle due to lack of traction, it would modulate engine power accordingly by interrupting the ignition circuit. This would therefore reduce drive-wheel spin and regain some traction, regardless of the driver's position on the accelerator pedal.\n\nToday's most recent traction control systems do basically the same thing as far as engine power reduction, only with the use of electronic throttle control (ETC), but modern TCS is also integrated with ABS. Just like anti-lock brakes use wheel speed input, commands to hydraulic valves, and a pump to control braking pressure and prevent wheel-skid, TCS applies brake pressure at each wheel with your foot off the brake (along with throttle control), to reduce wheel spin at the drive wheels while accelerating on low-traction surfaces (wet roads, sand, snow, etc.).\n\nKnowing ABS and TCS operation helps us understand electronic stability control. ESC fundamentally combines the technology of ABS and TCS with additional data used in the algorithm, along with modifications to hardware components. The two new data inputs are steering angle and yaw rate. Steering angle is data received by the ECU from a sensor mounted in the steering column. The steering angle sensor determines how many degrees, left or right, the driver is turning the steering wheel. The yaw rate, or rotational speed sensor, involves the direction and degree of potential vehicle spin. Look back at oversteer, where the vehicle loses rear-wheel traction and spins out. That amount of spinning momentum is the yaw rate.\n\nNow we can put it all together and view ESC operation. A vehicle traveling in low-traction conditions is about to oversteer on a hard turn at excessive speed. The ESC control unit looks at wheel speed, steering angle, and yaw rate, and it determines an oversteer event is about to take place. Now that it's quickly analyzing all the data, the ECU sends out instantaneous commands. By applying precise amounts of brake pressure at the appropriate wheels and regulating engine power when needed, the ESC prevents the oversteer. The system realistically views the difference between the driver's intended course and what's really going to happen and dictates the necessary actions to maintain control.\n\nCredit goes to Robert Bosch GmbH and Mercedes-Benz for the introduction of today's ESC systems with the '95 S-Class sedan. Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is a fully recognized generic term, but the system goes by various names deemed by each manufacturer, although principles, components, and operation are very similar.\n\n*Electronic Stability Program\n\n(ESP; various automakers)\n\n*StabiliTrak\n\n(General Motors)\n\n*Vehicle Stability Assist\n\n(VSA; Honda, Acura, and Hyundai)\n\n*Vehicle Stability Control\n\n(VSC; Toyota and Lexus)\n\n*Vehicle Dynamic Control\n\n(VDC; various automakers)\n\n*Dynamic Stability Control\n\n(DSC; BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Mazda)\n\n*AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control\n\n(Ford)\n\nABS and TCS are now incorporated with the ESC system. Often the control unit, hydraulic pump, solenoids, and valves are combined in a single assembly referred to as a modulator unit, located in series with the brake lines between the master cylinder and all four brake calipers (or wheel cylinders in rear drum brake applications). The control unit uses network communications with other relative systems such as powertrain control.\n\nABS/TCS/ESC has been enhanced over time with additions including Active Rollover Protection (ARP), Emergency Brake Assist (EBA), and Dynamic Rear Proportioning (DRP). ARP adds a rollover or lateral acceleration sensor to aid the ESC system in preventing vehicle rollover. EBA determines an emergency braking situation by viewing the speed off the accelerator and on to the brake pedal. When an emergency is detected and the driver's force on the pedal is insufficient, additional brake pressure is applied until ABS takes over. DRP is a method of proportioning rear-wheel and front-wheel brake pressure for optimum stopping power.\n\nAutomatic braking is cutting-edge technology. By detecting a pending collision with the use of radar, video, infrared, ultrasonic, or other sources, the ABS/TCS/ESC system can apply the brakes independently with no input from the driver. This can prevent or reduce the severity of collisions. The same technology is used in adaptive cruise control to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead.\n\nDuring real-world use of ESC, typically an indicator light will flash while the system is operating. Depending on the severity of the event, the driver may feel nothing, thanks to seamless operation, or a degree of noise/vibration from the modulator unit. The majority of ESC-equipped vehicles provide a switch that fully or partially disables ESC and TCS temporarily. This may be used in unusual situations where TCS cannot get the vehicle out of snow or mud. And yes, ESC should be turned off prior to doing a burnout with sportier models.\n\nJust like the powertrain control module, which controls engine functions, the ESC system performs self-diagnostics. If the ESC, TCS, ABS, ESC Off, or any combination of these warning lights remain on, this indicates a failure, the system is disabled, and a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) is stored in memory to aid in repair.\n\nObviously, ESC cannot maintain vehicle control in all situations, like extreme weather conditions or overly aggressive driving. A driver may even counteract the advantages of ESC with more extreme cornering as compared to driving a non-ESC vehicle. Aside from racecar driving (risk expected), taking any vehicle to its outer limits of control is an accident waiting to happen.\n\nA lot of off-road enthusiasts do consider this stuff cheating, but recent programs based on the ABS/TCS/ESC system can be a distinct advantage. Traction control and anti-lock brakes alone take a 4x4 in low range to new levels crossing severe rocky or soft terrain. But sub-systems similar to Toyota's Crawl Control provide even more enhanced capabilities. Using the basics of ABS/TCS and a little throttle control, Crawl Control allows a driver to dial-in a designated low speed of travel in low-range four-wheel drive. Once engaged, the vehicle creeps along, providing optimum traction and eliminating driver error at the pedals. This focuses the driver's attention on steering and keeping the truck in an upright position.\n\nRemember all these utilities are building blocks on the foundation of anti-lock brakes, and there will be new ideas added to the mix in future models. Just like PCs, smartphones, and tablets, software technology is a remarkable aspect of the entire system.\n\nWrite to Us!\n\nIf you have a technical question regarding your pickup, SUV, or van, feel free to contact us!

But grown sons too often don't listen to their fathers. That's why Paul called in his advisor to help his offspring, John.\n\nCertainly, Paul knew John's situation wasn't entirely the younger man's fault. For John's generation (he's 40), economic changes make retirement planning a harder task than it was for Paul. \"Please help my son,\" the worried dad asked his financial advisor, Todd Black.\n\n\"Family is what really matters in most financial planning discussions,\" said Black, an advisor at Dogwood Capital Management in Cumming, Ga.\n\nPaul retired a few years ago, the old-fashioned way. After working for more than 35 years at a pharmaceutical company, he has a great pension and healthy savings. He provided a comfortable life for his wife and two sons. Now, he lives in a beautiful lakeside house in a nice suburb of Atlanta, spending spare time sailing on his boat.\n\nBut while he is set, he worries about his children. His sons, like most others of their generation, have a less certain future in retirement, with traditional defined-benefit pension plans (which usually calculate payouts according to final salary and years of service) disappearing and the possibility of outliving their savings increasing.\n\nPaul's primary concern was about the financial health of his youngest son, John, who recently quit his job and moved back to Atlanta from Michigan. He never liked the cold winter in the north. John sold his house there, which ended up losing money.\n\nPaul fretted about the setbacks frustrating his son. An old-school father who did not express much emotion to his children, Paul figured that his advisor, Black, as a neutral third party, was better suited to take care of John's financial matters.\n\n\"I'm concerned about my son,\" Paul said. \"He seemed discouraged.\"\n\n\"I'll talk to him,\" said Black, reassuring Paul that he would give John encouragement and advice. He then gave John a call and offered to handle his finances.\n\nPicturing a comfortable retirement like his father's, John readily put his faith in Black. The father-son relationship was a good one, but \"it's still easier for John to call me when he has questions,\" Black said.\n\nJohn started a new job at an insurance company in Atlanta, so Black made sure that he took full advantage of his new retirement plan, plus health and life insurance programs. The advisor also updated his old retirement accounts.

Kelley Blue Book estimates that April sales will come in 5.2 percent higher than a year ago for the month. \"While April won't bring too many surprises, sales should continue to grow at a steady pace,\" said KBB senior analyst Alec Gutierrez.\n\nEven as sales are ahead of last year's on a month-over-month basis, they have leveled off some from March's torrid pace which pushed the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) to over 17 million. In April SAAR dropped back to 16.5 million, still a half million units more than a year ago.\n\nAmong the hottest segments is the crossover SUV allowing Jeep to post strong gains on the launch of its new 2015 Renegade, while Nissan has capitalized on the popularity of its Murano and Rogue, the latter comprising 20 percent of all the brand's sales. The only segment to see a decline during April is midsize car, down 3.1 percent over a year earlier levels. Part of that drop is attributed to the discontinuation of the Dodge Avenger, although three of the top four models also saw their sales ebb with only the Toyota Camry posting an increase.\n\nGutierrez concludes that \"Retail sales continue to be strong which continues to keep the overall sales outlook healthy. There is retrained incentive spending and steadily rising transaction prices, which are good for the industry.\"\n\nIncentives set to expire\n\nSpeaking of incentive restraint, GM's program expired April 30 and featured payments as high as $4,000 on 2014 Buick Lacrosse models and GMC Sierra 1500 (the previous generation pickup), and on 2015 models, payments as high as $2,000 on the Cadillac SRX and the heavy duty models of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. Financing ranged from 0 to 6.9 percent.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) will end its current incentive program May 4, which offers rebates ranging from $500 to $3,000 across its range of 2015 vehicles, and as much as $4,250 on select 2014 Chrysler 300 models. On 2015 models, Jeep Patriot has cash back ranging from $500 to $3,000, Dodge Journey, $500 to $2,750, while Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans max out at $2,500. Financing deals from the automaker have rates ranging from 0 to 7.9 percent.\n\nAmong Asian imports, programs at Mazda, Honda, Subaru and Toyota expired April 30. Mazda was offering $4,000 on the CX-9, plus finance deals on other models; Nissan's rebates ranges from $500 on 2015 Rogue and Versa Note to $4,000 on 2014 Maximas; Toyota's payments includes as much as $3,000 on 2014 Prius c models and Subaru and Honda offered subsidized financing ranging from 0 to 8.9 percent and 0.9 to 5.9 percent respectively. BMW, Mercedes and VW program that ended April 30 were finance only. Ford's current program runs through June 1, Jaguar/Land Rover through June 30 and Volvo and Audi through July 1.

Tesla inspects these vehicles and guarantees the remaining battery life and drive system as well as offering 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nThe site allows buyers to shop various markets and also specify color, vehicle type, ranging from the entry-level 60 kWh, the extended-range 85 kWh model or the performance model, also with 85 kWh.\n\nAccording to trade journal Auto Remarketing, prices on used Teslas ranged from $55,000 for a 2013 60 kWh Model S in Atlanta with 24,558 miles to $91,500 for a performance version Model S with 19,894 miles in the San Francisco Bay area. Buyers can select vehicles from 2012-2014 model years.\n\nCadillac CTS-V to return\n\nAfter a one model year hiatus, the Cadillac CTS-V is slated to return this summer as a 2016 model boasting 640 horsepower, a 200-mph top speed and a sticker price of $83,995 plus $995 destination. While that represents a considerable bump up over the $65,000 sticker of the previous generation model, Cadillac says it compares favorably against the competition (BMW's M5 and Mercedes' E63 AMG) in performance and MSRP, offering more output for less money than its rivals, which retail for $93,600 for the 560-hp M5 and $101,700 for the 577-hp E63.\n\nOffered previously in coupe, sedan and wagon bodystyles, the CTS-V will return initially as a sedan boasting 84 more horsepower than the car it replaces. It will again offer a supercharged 6.2-liter V8. Cadillac is looking to cover a wide swath of the performance market by introducing the smaller ATS-V model, which produces 454 horsepower from its twin-turbo 3.6-liter V6. That model starts at $60,465 plus destination and is offered in coupe and sedan body styles.\n\nAudi to share\n\nAudi is testing two car sharing programs in the U.S., one geared to residential scenarios called Audi at Home and the other, a short term rental program called Audi on Demand. The former is being tested in Miami where a luxury condominium complex will keep Audis on hand for shared used by the residents as a perk of unit ownership. In San Francisco, the German automaker has started the Audi on Demand, which employs smartphone apps and a similar pool approach as Zipcar and Daimler's Car2Go program feature Smart cars.\n\nBut unlike their rivals, the Audi on Demand program features luxurious offerings and instead of having to travel to a central lot to pick up the vehicle, Audi delivers the car concierge-style and will pick it up at the end of the loan.\n\nPopular at KBB.com\n\nSee the All-New Cars for 2015\n\n10 Coolest Cars Under $18,000\n\nBest Buys of 2015", "san diego -- A jogger suffered major injuries when she was struck by a car while crossing a residential street toward a park in Carmel Valley Thursday, San Diego police said.\n\nShe was in a crosswalk heading south across Mona Lisa Street when she was hit by a BMW going east on Del Mar Trails Road, police Lt.

Several MINI concepts are said to have been canceled as well.\n\nThe news come as a surprise since out of the bunch, at least the i8S made the most sense. BMW is said to plan some exciting concepts for next year to celebrate the company's 100th birthday. The i8S was rumored to be the supercar of the future, based on the i8 but with more power and even more exclusive looks.\n\nThe Z2 Roadster cancelation is also a surprise since hints were given before that a small premium roadster is needed in the lineup. Maybe with the also rumored Z5 Roadster, BMW saw no need to sell another roadster in a segment that has been decreasing over the last few years.\n\nAs always, we advise you to take these rumors with a big grain of salt, so far none of the \"now axed\" models were acknowledged by BMW, so the company might still have some surprises prepared for us next year.", "A couple from Colonsay are the big winners of the Hospitals of Regina Foundation Spring Home Lottery.\n\nEric and Erna Sander had the winning ticket that gave them the keys to a $1.25 million house in The Creeks neighbourhood, along with $10,000 cash.\n\n\"I'm still in shock.

Fortunately, the gun misfired and the girl was not shot.\n\nInvestigators have released new details and images from the unsolved robbery inside Asia Gold at 5010 Steeles Ave. W. Police are still looking for all five suspects.\n\nDet.-Sgt. Mike Fleischaker, of the of hold-up unit, described to media on Friday what police believe happened on Aug. 1, 2014. The allegations have not been proven in court.\n\nAt around 7:50 p.m., he said, a female suspect entered the store, pretending to be a customer. She asked to look at several items before leaving.\n\nShe returned half an hour later with a second woman. She asked to see a white gold necklace again. She then allegedly pulled out a handgun, repeatedly demanding that the owner turn over the necklace.\n\nThe second suspect was wielding a Taser. When the owner didn't hand over the necklace, she used the Taser on him and on an employee. The owner ran into a back room.\n\nThe first suspect shot at him.\n\n\"The round narrowly missed the owner, went through the door and lodged in a wall in the back of the business,\" said Fleischaker.\n\nThe woman with the Taser then allegedly jumped over the counter and grabbed the 11-year-old daughter of the owner. The first suspect was \"just a few feet\" from the girl when she pointed the gun and, according to witnesses, pulled the trigger multiple times.\n\n\"For reasons unknown, the firearm failed to fire.\"\n\nThree male suspects had been trying to enter the store, added Fleischaker. A security system had activated by this point, so they were able to enter the first set of doors, but not the second.\n\nThe owner and an employee ran back out into the room and \"engaged in a struggle with the two female suspects,\" he said. The suspects grabbed \"an item of jewelry\" and then fled with the males.\n\nThey got into a black BMW and drove away, heading east on Steeles Ave.\n\n\"Clearly, the female suspects here were extremely violent and were quite prepared to do whatever it took to accomplish their goal of obtaining some jewelry, including shooting a firearm at an owner and also his 11-year-old daughter,\" said Fleischaker.\n\nNine months later, police are still looking for all five people involved. They are asking the public to provide information that might help.\n\nPolice released several images of the suspects taken from security footage.

The top three collectors were Fort Lauderdale (48.9 percent); Hollywood (15 percent) and Dania Beach (7.6 percent).\n\nBeachwalk also is stirring keen interest from other developers of traditional hotels and condo-resorts, attracted by the redevelopment underway and city improvements proposed or in the pipeline, Klopp said. \"We have many positive things happening.\"\n\nDeveloped by The Related Group in Miami, the 216-unit Beachwalk condo-resort boasts two-bedroom suites that can be divided into separate one-bedroom suites and standard hotel rooms for tourists and locals to enjoy when owners aren't living there.\n\n\"We manage and operate Beachwalk as a regular hotel,\" said Benjamin Caban, director of sales and marketing, noting that condo owners can opt in to its rental program to earn a percentage of sales when units are rented as hotel rooms.\n\nBeachwalk is the first South Florida property for Gemstone Hotels & Resorts, a Utah management company that specializes in upscale independent hotel properties.\n\nAll units were sold out eight months before construction started, Caban said.\n\nThe condo-hotel also houses 84 private residences whose owners have access to an exclusive lounge, bar and rooftop pool, among other amenities.\n\nWhen Related Group launched sales of the condos and residences in February 2013, prices ranged from $399,900 to $699,900.\n\nBeachwalk's entrance and lobby showcase contrasting hues of red, blue, gray and white, while artwork curated by Related Group CEO Jorge M. Perez is dotted throughout the property.\n\nItalian design house Pininfarina, known for its work in the automotive industry with brands such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and BMW, created the condo-hotel's interior design. Rooms are decorated in soft earthy palettes of white and brown and feature contemporary Italian furnishings.\n\n\"We have close to 1,000 room nights already on the books for May and [occupancy] the first three months of opening is looking great,\" Caban said. \"We're excited. This is definitely a new beginning for Hallandale Beach.\"\n\nNow through July 31, Beachwalk is offering nightly rates from $129 to $249 depending on room category, Caban said.\n\nThe resort's restaurant -- Beachwalk Bistro & Market -- is set to open by mid-May serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, and will also offer grab-and-go items. The hotel also offers an infinity-edged outdoor pool, fitness center, free bicycles for city touring and a complimentary shuttle service to the Hollywood Broadwalk, Gulfstream Park Racing & Casino and Aventura Mall.\n\nA $20 per room daily resort fee covers the cost of the shuttle service and Wi-Fi access in hotel rooms and public areas, Caban said.\n\nBeachwalk, at 2602 E. Hallandale Beach Blvd., also will shuttle guests for free in an electronic buggy cart to the beach and to its beach club -- Hyde Kitchen & Cocktails, which will also open later in May.\n\nHyde Kitchen sits behind Beachwalk's sister property, the Hyde Resort & Residenences, which is being built just outside city limits in Hollywood. The beach club will offer towels, beach chairs and umbrellas, and Mediterranean-inspired food and beverages.\n\nBeachwalk, with its modern and chic offerings, should regentrify Hallandale Beach tourism, not unlike Fort Lauderdale's transformation from spring break mecca to a more family-oriented and upscale vacation destination, said real estate analyst Jack McCabe of Deerfield Beach.\n\nHallandale doesn't have the concentration of tourist lodgings as some of its neighboring beach communities. Prior to Beachwalk, it offered a handful of chain hotels and motels such as a Best Western Plus, Knights Inn and Hampton Inn, and mom and pop properties.\n\n\"Without a doubt it will be a real positive for the marketplace,\" McCabe said.\n\nAs the only city in Florida with two racinos -- Gulfstream Park and Mardi Gras -- Hallandale Beach has the potential to attract more tourism development, Mayor Joy Cooper said in an email Thursday, while vacationing overseas.\n\nTourism officials welcomed Beachwalk and said it will attract a multigenerational market, a growing market.\n\n\"[Beachwalk] is the first new luxury hotel in Hallandale Beach and it is a great reflection of how Broward's hotel industry is growing,\" said Nicki E.

Keep in mind, I have a number of criteria that have to be met before I fork over the dough from my secret stash -- complete service records, no track time, no modifications and accident-free. And that's just for starters. As to why I want a sports car in general and an S2000 specifically, the answers are simple: 1. I've reached that point in my life where I can. 2. Honda's zippy, lightweight, two-seat droptop has one of the most engaging powertrains of any non-exotic I have ever driven -- especially its six-speed manual, which is the literal definition of precision.

They're interchangeable enough that I'd just go for the one with the lowest mileage.

Of course, it would have to have Jackie Stewart plaid seats and a six speed, and it would need to be a five-door hatch so it could be used for family duty as much as early-morning rips along the parkway.

It is also way less than the limit specified here, so I have coin to keep it on the road for many years to come. While I do lust after a European ride -- and many fall below the price cap -- it usually takes the same amount of money as the purchase price to keep it on the road for the next five years.

That's more than two-thirds of us who are unfulfilled by our work, just dragging our sorry selves to and from the office every day.\n\nOne community has an attractive answer: Just quit.\n\nA burgeoning online community advocates early retirement. And they're not talking about people quitting in their 50s or early 60s. They mean retiring before age 40 -- perhaps even in their 20s.\n\nOver the past few months, I've interviewed seven people who have managed to leave the working world before age 40. That seems like a crazy idea to most people, but these extreme retirees insist it's something everyone should consider. What they all understand -- and what they wish other people understood -- is that achieving financial freedom isn't just about budgeting or clipping coupons; it's about reconsidering your core values.\n\nCut down on the big three, then invest\n\nThe basic framework of early retirement is pretty simple: cut way down on your spending, then invest your savings. High savings rates can lead to surprisingly fast retirements. For example, if you save half your income, you'll be ready to retire in around 17 years.\n\nAnd the best place to start on cutting costs isn't with coupons or thrift stores; it's with the big purchases. The lion's share of savings in early retirement come from what Jeremy Jacobson calls \"the big three\": housing, transportation, and food.\n\n\"While many of my coworkers were maybe leasing a new BMW SUV, I sold my car and started riding my bike. And when one of my coworkers was spending $50,000 remodeling his kitchen, we moved into a small apartment that was in a very walkable neighborhood,\" says Jacobson, who along with his wife, Winnie Tseng, blogs about the early retirement life at Go Curry Cracker. Likewise, he says, Tseng learned how to cook well enough that they started eating out far less.\n\nThe approach of cutting back on these three areas makes sense when you look at how American households spend their money. The average home in 2013 spent $51,100, according to the Labor Department, and together, shelter, transportation, and food accounted for nearly two-thirds of that. For most households, these are the places with the biggest opportunities for savings.\n\nOnce households have cut back on those huge expenses, the other part is making that saved money earn more money.\n\nHow do you know when you're ready to retire? Many of the retirees I spoke to rely on the \"4 percent rule,\" a common rule of thumb that retirees can safely withdraw 4 percent of their savings each year without exhausting their principal. Jacobson and Tseng estimated they'd need $1.2 million saved up. The couple that blogs at Frugalwoods estimated they'd need $1.4 million. This gives each of those couples something like $50,000 to $60,000 to spend annually.\n\nMr. Money Mustache, the best-known early retirement blogger, has done the math and shown that assuming a 5 percent rate of return, if you save half your take-home income, you can retire in 17 years. If you save even 30 percent, it's 28 years -- which might sound like a long time, but if you start at age 22, it means retiring at 50, far earlier than most people do. And this is far less than many extreme early retirees' savings rates. Several of the retirees I spoke with have managed to save 70 percent or more, allowing them to retire in less than 10 years.\n\nYes, those are all far more than your typical American's savings rate -- currently at 5.8 percent of total income -- but many Americans (particularly those with above-average incomes) could probably save a lot more than they think, as Vox's Tim Lee wrote earlier this year. The average home is 50 percent larger than it was 30 years ago, so many people could save a lot by downsizing. Transportation costs the average household more than $9,000 a year. Live somewhere near the right bus line or, even better, somewhere walkable, and you can slash that easily.\n\n\"If you think about it the person who's cooking your lunch at a cafe or is serving your coffee ... somehow they're living or getting by,\" says Justin McCurry, a 34-year-old former civil engineer who retired a year ago and blogs at Root of Good. \"If you figure out how those folks are getting by and emulate that, but you're making middle-income or upper-income salaries, living one step down and saving that surplus left each month -- I think that's how you have to do it if you're in a higher-cost-of-living area.\"\n\nIt of course helps to have some investment savvy -- some retirees I spoke with advocated picking a good index fund and avoiding big brokerage fees, for example. But really, aggressive saving is far more important than any investment wizardry, says one early retiree.\n\n\"Even if we put 100 percent of our savings into bonds, we still could have achieved it,\" says Paul Novell, 46, who retired from a career as an electrical engineer at 38 and lives with his wife, Nina Fussing, in an RV (currently they are in Bend, Oregon). Because you don't have a lot of years to work before you retire, he says, aiming for huge returns to create that nest egg is misguided -- he considers investing far less important than cutting back on expenses.\n\nA lifestyle and a subculture\n\nIt's fairly easy to figure out how much you need to save to retire early. The trickier shift is making the lifestyle changes needed to save that kind of money.\n\nIt's a much bigger change than just cutting costs here and there. You need to stack a bunch of the savings choices on top of each other -- moving to a cheaper neighborhood, cooking all your meals at home, biking to work, buying clothing only rarely, cutting out expensive coffees, not indulging your kids. And when you're done, you'll have a new lifestyle, one that's unorthodox in a consumerist society.\n\nAnd as people living unconventional lives have done for decades, early retirees seek out kindred spirits online.\n\n\"Some of the closest friends we've made are online through the early retirement space because they're the most like-minded,\" says Mrs. Frugalwoods (the couple requested not to use their real names). \"That's a real source of satisfaction and enjoyment for me, and I love being able to reach people and talk to them about the joys frugality can bring you.\"\n\nMany extreme savers simply love cutting costs, self-sufficiency, and tinkering with a budget. The Frugalwoods couple fits this bill. They do a lot of services for themselves -- a concept they call \"radical insourcing.\"\n\n\"Earlier this year Mrs. Frugalwoods for the first time allowed me to cut her hair,\" says Mr. Frugalwoods. \"A few YouTube videos and a bottle of wine, and we got it done.\" (His wife reports she was pleased with the results.)\n\nTheir YouTube-fueled self-sufficiency covers not just haircuts but bike repair and pet grooming. Not only that, but the couple rarely buys clothing, dumpster dives occasionally, and spends {0} on entertainment (\"Paying for entertainment is like admitting defeat,\" they have written on their blog). They estimate that they spent around $13,700 last year on non-housing-related expenses. By contrast, the average US household spent more than double that: $34,000.\n\nWhy engineers love extreme frugality\n\nThe majority of people who responded to my request for interviews (I sought out early retirees on Twitter and Reddit) are either current or retired engineers. There is, of course, some logic to this -- engineers tend to have higher-than-average salaries -- and there could be some self-selection at work in my sample, as well (maybe engineers simply hang out on Reddit a lot). But the retirees themselves believe something else is at work: the need to tweak and fiddle, taking pleasure in the improvements that come from making minor adjustments to their finances.\n\n\"I was born as the stereotypical engineer kid, which means I was always interested in optimizing everything. Money was just one of those things,\" Pete, a.k.a. Mr. Money Mustache, told me earlier this year.\n\nMr. Frugalwoods, who works as a software engineer, uses his job as an example.\n\n\"A lot of what we're doing is all about having a long-term goal and spending our money around the pursuit of that goal and optimizing the crap out of everything else,\" says Mr. Frugalwoods. \"At work I spend a lot of time trying to cut 100 milliseconds off of a webpage load, and that same kind of analytical optimizing mindset plays into this.\"\n\nExtreme frugality often means changing what you value\n\nPerhaps the most important thing you need for early retirement is an ability to break out of conventional societal programming -- the persistent notion that a person has to work for four or five decades and retire at 65 or later to live a productive, fulfilling, \"normal\" life.\n\nEvery single early retiree I spoke with stressed that more people could live like them, but many of us simply never consider the possibility of busting out of our normal ways of life.\n\n\"There are probably seven billion different right ways to live. Some people love what they do. Some people would be terrified of an unstructured environment. So there's not a right answer for everybody,\" says McCurry. \"[But] you talk to people sometimes and you know they're not happy with what they're doing with their lives, but at the same time they're not open to the idea of something else.\"\n\nJacobson is a prime example of how a person's point of view can shift -- in his first few years out of college, he worked hard at paying down student debt but also bought a new car and a house that came with a 40-minute commute. Deciding to try for financial independence meant breaking the keeping-up-with-the-joneses cycle of bigger houses and new cars he fell into by default in his early 20s.\n\nWhat all of this this means is that early retirement isn't for everyone. While working less and enjoying life more might sound great to most people, it means giving up some things that might genuinely bring you joy -- if fancy dinners out on the town and a large house truly bring you more joy than the idea of retiring early, then it makes a lot less sense to retire at 40.\n\nSometimes the shifts can go beyond even lifestyle changes. Starting a new financial lifestyle can open up an entirely new outlook on your own identity, as Mrs. Frugalwoods knows well.\n\nShe's one of the most visible women in the early retirement community -- she does the majority of the blogging at Frugalwoods. The process of becoming mindful about her spending, she says, changed how she views her own femininity.\n\n\"It's really been a personal journey for me to not worry as much about what people think about me and really gaining confidence and really setting that societal concern and fear about appearance,\" she says.\n\nShe has stopped buying clothing -- she says she hasn't bought a new article in 16 months -- and no longer wears makeup. What resulted, she says, is a \"fantastic transformation,\" as she has shrugged off the double standards society places on women: now she has a new perspective on what it means to be successful (and, more to the point, how little it has to do with appearance). In the process of being less focused on money, she became less focused on how she looks ... and more aware of who she is.\n\n\"Honestly it wasn't so much about being frugal as about being true to myself,\" she says. \"I found ways to just be more confident and happy with what I have and have less of a focus on my appearance, and it has made me into a much more confident person. I'm a better writer [and] employee, and it's made me happier.\"\n\nSome people have a big head start on extreme saving\n\nMaybe a lot more of us could retire well before 65. But there are certain factors that give certain people a big head start over the rest of us.\n\nOne is working in a high-paying industry -- and early, says Novell.\n\n\"The good-paying job when you're young is critical. If not, the math just never works out,\" says Novell.\n\nLikewise, having no student debt helps -- Novell and Fussing, as well as the Frugalwoods couple, acknowledge that this eased their path to financial independence.\n\nThere's another, less obvious factor in many early retirees' success: a lifetime of privilege. The Frugalwoods couple is outspoken on this topic. In one February post, Mrs. Frugalwoods wrote about how having well-educated, middle-class parents set up her and her husband to get educated themselves, take good-paying jobs, and start on the path to early retirement in the first place.\n\nPersonal responsibility is a major theme in many financial independence blogs and forums -- if people simply take control of their money and their lives, the thinking goes, they can much more easily have an early retirement than they realize. That may be true, she wrote, but she added that \"the game is rigged\" in their favor and against many others.\n\nIt's not retirement; it's \"retirement\"\n\nThe most common term for what these people have done -- leaving the working world and pursuing their own interests decades before the rest of us do -- is \"early retirement,\" but this phrase is itself the source of heated debate in the community. Plenty of others prefer the term \"financial independence,\" as retirement implies a lifetime of relaxation and nonproductivity. In fact, many early \"retirees\" end up working again -- just not taking traditional jobs they need to do for an income.\n\n\"Being freed from having to work to pay the bills, many [early retirees] plan to retire from professional life in the sense of no longer working in that career,\" as Jacob Lund Fisker writes at Early Retirement Extreme, one of the most popular early retirement blogs.\n\nThe goal of early retirement (or financial independence, if that's your phrase of choice) is to be able to have enough money to never have to work again. But that doesn't mean early retirees won't work if they feel like it. The Frugalwoods couple's plan to retire to a farm in Vermont and be as self-sufficient as possible. McCurry, meanwhile, says he might consult on friends' startups, in exchange for equity.\n\nSo while it's easy to ask if early retirement wouldn't be just a little boring, Fisker simply lists all the other things you could be doing than sitting in an office.\n\nEarly retirement \"usually means taking up some other activity that is more meaningful to them [than work] but which would be hard to make a living from such as raising children, saving the world, rock climbing, making art, open source programming, writing, etc.,\" he writes. \"It doesn't mean doing nothing.\"", "All five suspects then fled the scene in a four-door, black coloured BMW.\n\nYork regional police have released security video of a violent jewelry store robbery from August of last year.\n\nIt was reported that just before 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 1, 2014, two female suspects entered the store on Steele Avenue West in Vaughan.\n\nPolice said one of the suspects pointed a gun at the store owner's 11-year-old daughter and tried to fire several times, but the gun malfunctioned.\n\nFemale suspect #1 tried to fire several times at 11 yr old girl inside jewellery store - thankfully gun malfunctioned pic.twitter.com/9IE9FJu3qH\n\n-- Tammie Sutherland (@citytammie) May 1, 2015\n\nThe second suspect, allegedly armed with a Taser, stunned the store owner and a second employee.\n\nFemale suspect#2 armed w/ taser, stunned owner & employee of store.

The first section of this report presents a set of definitions and taxonomy for mobile value-added services (MVAS). The report then presents the market context including MVAS adoption trends based on an enterprise survey, and looks at the major forces driving and inhibiting the adoption of MVAS across enterprise segments in the region. The report also presents three case studies from MNOs that provide an in-depth view of the solutions they are implementing in the MVAS space. It concludes with a number of key findings and a set of recommendations.\n\nKey Findings\n\n- This report finds that Latin America is at an inflection point, where a combination of technology adoption and demand forces will help enterprise mobile value-added services take off. The penetration of LTE and smartphones, the adoption of MVAS platforms and the emergence of fixed-mobile convergence networks are the pivotal factors that can lead to massive MVAS growth in the near feature in Latin America. But MNOs face significant challenges due to the lack of local qualified professionals to sell, implement and support MVAS; and from the complexity of selling to multiple individual business units.\n\n- Enterprises in the region are making MVAS a top priority to empower their mobile workforce, with collaboration and productivity tools that are available from anywhere at any time. The results of the survey showed that 85% of Latin American enterprise respondents interviewed expect their MVAS spend to increase in the near future, meaning greater opportunities for MNOs and technology vendors with presence in the region.\n\n- Latin America MNOs face strong competition from large IT service providers. The results of this study show that Latin American enterprises often look to large ITSPs such as IBM and HP to manage their MVAS. These companies will continue playing an important role in the design, build, deliver and manage phases of MVAS offers, including the physical infrastructure (i.e., hardware), in particular for large enterprises. IBM should gain traction through its recent partnership with Apple. Despite this competitive threat, MNOs in the region will invest in MVAS platforms and collaborative partnerships from these vendors, and can play a central role because of their ability to integrate mobile connectivity services and MVAS, and to simplify commercialization, provisioning, billing and support of services.\n\n- International case studies show that experienced operators had initially developed strategies focused on the large enterprise/corporate and MNCs segments, and then developed plans focused on the SMB segment. MNOs are leveraging their corporate segment skills and competencies and implementing MVAS platforms (i.e., mobile applications marketplace) that help \"massive\" reach-out to the SMB segment.\n\n- When it comes to large multinational outsourcing deals, Latin American local MNOs face strong competition from companies such as ATandT, Vodafone, Orange Business Services and Verizon that position themselves as full ITSPs. However, there is a significant market opportunity from the SMB and local large enterprise segments.\n\nSynopsis\n\n\"Enterprise Mobile Value-Added Services in Latin America: Major Forces Driving and Inhibiting MVAS for MNOs\", a Telecom Insider Report by Publisher.\n\nIn this report we present an enterprise mobile value-added services (MVAS) taxonomy to provide a representative structure, organized in a way that is consistent with the mobile operator industry.

Those offers are targeting the medium-high residential segment, which is the one with higher margins and the most attractive,\" said Moody's analyst Carlos Winzer.\n\nNO COINCIDENCE\n\nThe move's timing is no coincidence, sources also say, as Telefonica wants to take advantage of a dominant market position to bind clients to its offers.\n\nSpain's antitrust watchdog CNMC is set to force the firm to open up its fiber optic network in most of Spain by-year-end and prices of domestic football rights may sky-rocket as a result of a new sports law due to soon be passed.\n\nCompetition will also heat up, with Al Jazeera launching its BeIn sports channel in Spain this summer and Netflix due to make available its video streaming service in September.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts see no more than one in five clients switching to existing competitors. Teliasonera's Yoigo and Vodafone, which bought cable firm Ono last year, have also announced price hikes while Orange is busy buying Jazztel and unlikely to break ranks.\n\nThe British unit freshly sold, fixing Spain had also become a necessity to hedge the currency, economic and political risks of Latin America, where expected consolidation in Brazil and Mexico may translate into financial pressure in the short-term.\n\nLatin America accounts for 50 percent of revenues, or 56 percent without Britain in the total, up from 40 percent in 2008.\n\nSuch a price-driven revamp is however fragile by nature and much of its success will depend on how consumers respond.\n\n\"Whilst the economic recovery is strong in Spain, the risk of pricing disruption in case of renewed economic weakness is higher,\" Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\n(Editing by Anna Willard)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nSpain s Telefonica bets on price hikes to end six-year slump - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "DOZENS of villagers near Ilminster are limbering up for round two of their fight against a mobile phone giant attempting to erect a new \"horrendous\" mast.\n\nA group of neighbours in Horton are rallying against the proposals from Vodafone, 13 years after successfully seeing previous plans thrown out.\n\nVillagers say there were told by the telecommunications giant at the time that the decision of refusal for the plans would not be contested, or even revisited, but now there is major concern over an application for a new, bolstered pole, which would also be shared with Telefonica to serve O2 users.\n\nSince 2002, residents have pushed ahead with the creation of a skate park, just 200 yards from the mast, on the understanding that the existing mast at Nyworthy Farm would not be enhanced.\n\nHorton Parish Council has written to South Somerset District Council to outline its \"great concerns\" over the health of children using the park.\n\nNot only do residents echo such fears, they also take issue with the visual impact of the proposed mast and the procedure of how the application process has gone ahead.\n\nAlthough the existing mast will decrease in height by 0.2m, six white steel antennas will be attached to the top of the pole, while an additional dish twice the size of the two existing dishes will be introduced.\n\nA spokesman for the group said: \"We just want Vodafone to stick to what they were told to do more than ten years ago.

Those offers are targeting the medium-high residential segment, which is the one with higher margins and the most attractive,\" said Moody's analyst Carlos Winzer.\n\nThe move's timing is no coincidence, sources also say, as Telefonica wants to take advantage of a dominant market position to bind clients to its offers.\n\nSpain's antitrust watchdog CNMC is set to force the firm to open up its fibre optic network in most of Spain by-year-end and prices of domestic football rights may sky-rocket as a result of a new sports law due to soon be passed.\n\nCompetition will also heat up, with Al Jazeera launching its BeIn sports channel in Spain this summer and Netflix due to make available its video streaming service in September.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts see no more than one in five clients switching to existing competitors. Teliasonera's Yoigo and Vodafone, which bought cable firm Ono last year, have also announced price hikes while Orange is busy buying Jazztel and unlikely to break ranks.\n\nThe British unit freshly sold, fixing Spain had also become a necessity to hedge the currency, economic and political risks of Latin America, where expected consolidation in Brazil and Mexico may translate into financial pressure in the short-term.\n\nLatin America accounts for 50 percent of revenues, or 56 percent without Britain in the total, up from 40 percent in 2008.\n\nSuch a price-driven revamp is however fragile by nature and much of its success will depend on how consumers respond.\n\n\"Whilst the economic recovery is strong in Spain, the risk of pricing disruption in case of renewed economic weakness is higher,\" Barclays analysts said in a note. ($1 = 0.9193 euros) (Editing by Anna Willard)", "Investors speculating the dollar rally is fizzling out may be overlooking trillions of reasons why it will keep on going.\n\nThere's pent-up demand for the U.S. currency that will underpin years of appreciation because the world is \"structurally short\" the dollar, according to investor and former International Monetary Fund economist Stephen Jen.\n\nSovereign and corporate borrowers outside America owe a record $9 trillion in the U.S. currency, much of which will need repaying in coming years, data from the Bank for International Settlements show.\n\nIn addition, central banks that had reduced their holdings of the greenback are starting to reverse course, creating more demand. The dollar's share of global foreign reserves shrank to a record 60 percent in 2011 from 73 percent a decade earlier, though it's since climbed back to 63 percent.\n\nSo, the short-term ebbs and flows caused by changes in Federal Reserve policy or economic data releases may be overwhelmed by these larger forces combining to fuel more appreciation, according to Jen, the London-based co-founder of SLJ Macro Partners LLP and the former head of currency research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nDollar 'Power'\n\n\"Short-covering will continue to power the dollar higher,\" said Jen, who predicts a 9 percent advance in the next three months to 96 cents per euro. \"The dollar's strength is not just about cyclical factors such as growth. The recent consolidation will likely prove to be temporary.\"\n\nMost strategists and investors agree on the reasons for the dollar's advance versus each of its major counterparts during the past year: the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates while other nations are loosening policy.\n\nBloomberg's Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against 10 major peers including the euro and yen, has surged 20 percent since the middle of 2014. The gains stalled recently, sending the index down more than 3 percent in the three weeks through April 3, as Fed officials tempered investors' expectations about the pace of rate increases.\n\nTop Forecaster\n\nJen isn't the only one who thinks short-dollar positions will cause the rally to extend.\n\nChris Turner, head of foreign-exchange strategy at ING Groep NV, sees the dollar surging through parity with the European currency by mid-year, from $1.0586 per euro as of 12:11 p.m. in New York. He said gains will be spurred by bonds from Germany to Ireland yielding below zero.\n\n\"Central banks are re-accumulating their dollar reserves and low, or negative, bond yields in the euro zone will probably speed up that trend,\" said London-based Turner, whose bank topped Bloomberg's rankings for the most accurate currency forecasts in the past two quarters.\n\nNot everyone thinks the dollar will keep on climbing. David Bloom, global head of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a report that the effects of policy divergence have run their course and that the greenback rally \"will stall as the market demands: tell me something I don't know.\"\n\nBillionaire Bill Gross of Janus Capital Group Inc. has meanwhile been betting on U.S. Treasuries against German bunds on the basis that the spread between American and European interest rates will narrow. He called his bet \"the trade of the year.\"\n\nRates 'Dichotomy'\n\nAdrian Lee, whose eponymous investment company oversees more than $5 billion, does expect the dollar to keep strengthening and points to monetary policy as the biggest driver as the tightening bias of the Fed contrasts with a European Central Bank that's expanding the money supply.\n\n\"The dichotomy between Europe and the U.S. is most interesting,\" said Lee, chief investment officer at Adrian Lee & Partners, which has offices in London and Dublin. \"If you ask where our strategy would be in a year's time, we can easily have a forecast of the euro well below $1.\"\n\nHe also sees another structural factor that's underpinning the dollar: the U.S.'s shrinking current-account deficit.\n\nThe decline in oil prices -- even with the shale-gas revolution, the nation is still an importer -- has helped the U.S. reduce its trade shortfall to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's down from a record 5.9 percent in 2006.\n\nFor Jen, the rise in dollar-denominated debt across the globe is key. The $9 trillion owed by borrowers outside the U.S. has surged from $6 trillion at the end of 2008 -- when the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero, making it cheaper to issue in the currency.\n\nRepaying Debt\n\nRussian gas producer OAO Gazprom, Spanish phone company Telefonica SA and ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, have each raised about $12 billion in the U.S. currency since then, data compiled by Bloomberg show. France and Sweden are among the biggest sovereign issuers, borrowing more than $100 billion between the two.\n\nSome of that will need to be repaid even if the remainder will be rolled over. And debt that will eventually be refinanced needs servicing in the meantime.\n\n\"After years of accumulating a huge amount of debt in dollars, borrowers will need to figure out how to repay\" given the currency's recent gains, Jen said. \"People will either repay early or start hedging actively. There'll be huge demand for the dollar that is much more than what's consistent with growth or interest-rate differentials.\"", "(Bloomberg) -- As European exporters benefit from a yearlong slide in the euro that's boosted revenue and profits, Spanish carrier Telefonica SA is among a group of companies that are grappling with a currency headache: the Brazilian real.\n\nIt's the only major currency to have weakened against the euro this year. After rallying in the first weeks of 2015, the Brazilian currency started sliding Jan. 23 and has dropped about 18 percent since.\n\nTelefonica is one of only 10 major European companies that get 20 percent or more of total revenue from Brazil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Among the group, the Spanish carrier has the highest total revenue from the country. A large share of sales in Brazil may also also hamper insurer Mapfre SA and retailer Carrefour SA this year.\n\n\"A weaker real is a problem for Telefonica,\" Andres Bolumburu, an analyst at Banco Sabadell SA, said by phone. \"Yes, debt goes down as well as income with the lower real, but in the end you have less money you take home.\"\n\nTelefonica already generates 23 percent of revenue in South America's largest economy, a share that will increase as the Madrid-based operator spends 7.45 billion euros ($8.1 billion) to acquire broadband supplier GVT from Vivendi SA. While the purchase price is hedged, future profits aren't, meaning a weak real translates to less euros at home in Spain and less cash to pay dividends.\n\nShares of Telefonica lost 0.2 percent to 13.29 euros at 9:24 a.m. in Madrid. They have gained 13 percent this year.\n\nForward Market\n\nThe real is now trading at about 3.50 per euro and forward market traders expect a fall to 3.82 by the end of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nGVT and Telefonica Brasil generated a total of 40.5 billion reais ($12.5 billion) in revenue and 12.6 billion reais in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year. Every 1 percent depreciation over the quarter in the real against the euro would result in about a 0.22 percent decline in Telefonica's total revenue, according to Erhan Gurses, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nA weaker real isn't Telefonica's only South American predicament. Last month, Europe's biggest carrier in the region announced a 2.8 billion-euro writedown in Venezuela linked to currency depreciation and last week it said a court decision related to taxes in Peru could crimp earnings by 437 million euros.\n\nCorruption Probe\n\nThe real is slumping the most among major currencies against the dollar as President Dilma Rousseff struggles to turn around the economy and a widening corruption probe erodes investor confidence. The central bank said last week it will phase out a swaps program that had supported the real over the past two years.\n\nThe drop of the real is partly compensated by the rise against the euro of other Latin American currencies, including the Mexican, Chilean and Argentine pesos. Telefonica's debt may also decline as the value of its real-denominated loans shrink in euro-terms. The carrier can and does partially offset currency fluctuations by hedging dollar-denominated contracts with suppliers in Brazil.\n\nA Telefonica press officer declined to comment on the company's dependence on the real. Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta said last month the company is very happy with Brazil and its macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe Spanish carrier has been cutting back its presence in Europe as it increases bets on Latin America. It announced the sale of its Irish and Czech units in 2013, and on March 24, billionaire Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. agreed to buy Telefonica's O2 wireless carrier in the U.K. for 10.25 billion pounds ($15.3 billion).", "Sprint Corp. has hired a telecommunications executive who last worked in Brazil to lead the company's new Hispanic business unit.\n\nRoger Sol\u00e9, 41, joins Sprint as the first senior vice president for the Hispanic market and senior vice president for innovation.

What happens next will be an auction for television broadcasting rights - one which LFP President Javier Tebas claims will be \"completely transparent\" and one from which the Professional Football League stands to rake in 1,000 million euros. Out of that figure, 93 per cent will go directly to the clubs in both of the top two divisions while 3.5% of it will be reserved as insurance for the teams who are relegated, the RFEF and LFP will take one per cent each; a further one per cent will be set aside for some of the 4,000 Spanish elite sportsmen and women so that they are able to make Social Security contributions during their time in activity. Finally, 0.5% will be destined to the Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE), other federation syndicates and women's football.\n\nEven though many clubs have contracts to honour with broadcasters such as Mediapro and Telef\u00f3nica for the 2015-16 season, the unified auction could go ahead in the new season.\n\nThe model for distributing revenue for clubs was agreed in Vigo on 16 November last year. Tebas explained that clubs will receive a more equal share of television revenues with no club able to claim more than a 20 per cent take of the total - a system which is closer, he says, to audiovisual rights distribution in the Premier League. Under Spanish law, such commercialization falls into two categories: the national market and international market. Specific details of how the latter will work have yet to be finalized although Tebas suggested several months ago that rights may be sold as a package so that various operators will be able to acquire broadcasting rights.\n\naudiovisuales de la Liga de f\u00fatbol, la Copa del Rey y la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a y los criterios para la distribuci\u00f3n de los ingresos entre los organizadores\".", "* Top clubs still get biggest share, but smaller ones benefit\n\n* Soccer rights a big draw for broadband and pay-TV providers (Recasts after new rules passed)\n\nBy Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez and Elisabeth O'Leary\n\nMADRID, April 30 (Reuters) - Spain approved new rules on Thursday under which the television rights to show Spanish soccer will be pooled and sold collectively.\n\nThis ends the previous system in which rights were sold by individual clubs and could lead to a sharp price increase for broadcasters.\n\nThe previous system heavily favoured big teams such as Real Madrid, the world's wealthiest club by income, and rivals Barcelona and, while the new set-up will still favour the biggest and most successful clubs, it will do so to a slightly lesser extent.\n\nOf total revenues from the sale of the rights, around 90 percent will go to all of the clubs in the first division and the remainder to the second.\n\nHalf of the income will be shared out equally between all first division clubs, Sports Minister Jose Ignacio Wert told reporters.\n\nThe other half will be divvied up according to their football performance in the previous five seasons, the size of the club and its take, and other criteria.\n\nSecond division clubs will follow the same system, except that an initial 70 percent of revenues will be split up equally.\n\nSmaller teams, especially those with big tax bills, have for years called for rights to be pooled to help them make ends meet and had threatened to strike over the issue.\n\nLa Liga, where the broadcast rights for most individual clubs have been bought by privately owned Mediapro, is the only top European league in which clubs negotiate their own TV contracts.\n\nAnalysts calculate that clubs will collectively obtain 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) per season, versus around 700 million euros currently.\n\nThe figure is less than half the 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) that English Premier League clubs will net per season from broadcasters Sky and BT under a new contract running between 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn Spain those likely to buy the rights are telecoms giant Telefonica or Mediapro, which has its own pay-TV channel GolTV and currently has the rights to many club games, including those of Real Madrid.\n\nTelefonica has reached an agreement with Barcelona to pay 140 million euros for its broadcast rights for next season.

Expect Labs was crowned the Traction Watch: Information Technology champion.

Today, about 10 percent of the Internet's traffic comes from voice input -- which should grow to more than 50 percent in five years. \"This is a massive change in user behavior,\" Tuttle said, fueled by the increase in voice queries a la Siri and Google Now on smartphones and wearables, such as Apple Watch. \"So a lot of companies right now are scrambling to figure out how to integrate (voice) into their applications, and today, it's a very difficult technical challenge.\"\n\nThis is the problem Expect Labs aims to solve with MindMeld, its speech recognition platform for software developers. With more than 1,300 companies currently using MindMeld to integrate voice into their applications, devices and websites, Expect Labs is clearly gaining traction. Revenues last year were $1.4 million, and Tuttle expects that to grow fourfold in 2015.\n\nWithout a platform like MindMeld, companies that want a voice interface to their software must build a custom knowledge graph and a natural language understanding model as well as implement sophisticated machine learning, Tuttle explained. All of this is needed to fulfill a user's spoken demand or request.\n\n\"Companies that try to do this today can take a year or more to get their applications running,\" Tuttle said. \"And for many, it's technically out of reach.\"\n\nThis is where MindMeld comes in. MindMeld takes all this technology and makes it available as an easy-to-use platform so companies can build a solid voice experience in a matter of days, not months or years. Once integrated, Expect Labs charges developers per API call completed.\n\nWithout naming names, Tuttle said Expect Labs' customers are using MindMeld to build applications that enable users \"to quickly find a video to watch\" on TV \"using simple voice commands from the couch\" or find products in stores with a voice search on a smartphone. Also, developers are using MindMeld for connected home appliances and wearable applications, \"where voice is the only input option.\" (Think: Apple Watch).\n\nFounded in 2011, Expect Labs spent three years building MindMeld before launching it in beta in 2014. Early on, the startup raised about $2 million in seed funding, according to The Wall Street Journal. In December 2014, Expect Labs announced $13 million in Series A funding. Backers include Google, Samsung, Intel, Telef\u00f3nica, and Liberty Global.\n\nExpect Labs hopes to ride the wave of the \"voice revolution,\" Tuttle said. \"In the past 18 months, advances in speech recognition have dwarfed the advances we've seen in the past 30 years combined,\" he added. \"In 18 months or less, we'll be using speech recognition systems that are better than humans for the first time since the dawn of AI.\"\n\nThe revolution is coming \"not a moment too soon,\" Tuttle continued. Within three years, there will be 3 billion computing devices with microphones, and fewer than 5 percent of them will have keyboards. In that environment, voice input will be critical.\n\n\"In the next few years, you'll see voice starting to appear in many of the apps you use every day,\" Tuttle added. \"It's already starting to happen.\"\n\nExpect Labs isn't the only company chasing this opportunity, of course. Apple and Google, not exactly minor players, both have big stakes in the speech recognition game. Despite its struggles, including a three-year decline in its stock price, speech recognition company Nuance Communications is another contender in the market and counts Carl Icahn among its investors.\n\nTuttle said he grew up \"watching sci-fi movies that paint a picture of the future, where we talk to machines.\" While earning a Ph.D. at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, he wanted to solve the problem of man-to-machine verbal interactions. But at the time, 10 years ago, the technology wasn't available.\n\nAfter starting other companies, including Web messaging company Bang Networks Inc. and Truveo Inc., a video search engine, Tuttle was hooked again by the advancements in AI.\n\n\"I'm convinced we're on the verge of solving this problem, and within a couple of years, you're going to routinely be able to talk to other machines the same way you talk to other humans,\" Tuttle said. \"That's why we started Expect Labs.\"\n\nJoin the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

But Podemos is facing its first internal crisis with the resignation of Juan Carlos Monedero, who was one of the party's leaders, on Thursday.\n\nAfter the announcement, Iglesias sent party followers a letter explaining some of the circumstances of Monedero's resignation.\n\n\"We had been discussing for months the hardship he was going through due to his position in Podemos' leadership,\" he wrote. \"Change requires many people playing very different roles, and Juan Carlos and I concluded long ago that he is not a party man, and that his place is where it always was: as a moral and intellectual point of reference for those who dream of a more fair society.\"\n\nBefore walking out, Monedero accused Podemos of starting to resemble the established parties that it criticizes so much, and called for a return to its origins.\n\nMonedero said that he would rather break free from the party chains.\n\n\"I feel like getting my own voice back, rather than remaining a cog in the party's wheels,\" he said.\n\nBut despite his disagreement with the direction the party is taking, Monedero said he will stay with Podemos at street level.

Her salary was unchanged at $1 million but the value of some of her stock and option awards jumped. The company said a large part of the increase came from performance-based options that were part of Mayer's recruitment package.\n\nThose awards were worth $15 million when they were approved, but Yahoo says their value has risen to about $40 million. They are counted as part of Mayer's 2014 compensation because the performance goals connected to the stock were set that year.\n\nYahoo hired Mayer away from Google Inc. in July 2012. Yahoo shares have nearly tripled in value during Mayer's tenure, mostly because of its holdings in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan rather than Yahoo's core business.\n\nThe company invested in Alibaba a decade ago and its stake is now worth close to $32 billion. But even though advertisers are shifting more of their spending to the Internet and mobile devices, Yahoo is still struggling to increase its revenue and it lags behind Google and Facebook in mobile revenue.\n\nEarlier this month, Yahoo reported its first-quarter results and pleased investors by saying it will cut costs and consider spinning off its stake in Yahoo Japan.\n\nThe Sunnyvale, California, company said in January that it will spin off its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. later this year. The move is designed to avoid a big tax bill.\n\nThe spinoff of the Alibaba stake and the potential spinoff of the Yahoo Japan holdings will increase pressure on Mayer to rejuvenate the company.\n\nYahoo's stock gained 25 percent in 2014. So far in 2015, it's down 14 percent.\n\nThe Associated Press calculation of executive compensation is based on a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He owns nightclubs in Paris and New York, works as a top editor of the men's fashion magazine L'Officiel Hommes and has appeared in countless glossy magazines as a tastemaker and bon vivant.\n\nTwo months ago, he showed up on the decidedly non-fashionista website Modern Hiker, along with a photo of a boulder he tagged in Joshua Tree National Park. Since then, Saraiva, who lives in France and is known by his fans as Mr. Andre and Mr. A., has been scorned by American nature lovers and thrust into a highly charged debate.\n\nNature as a canvas\n\nSaraiva is of a new generation of graffiti artists who regard nature -- not just the built environment -- as their canvas. They tag national parks, then on the Internet post photos of their work.\n\nThose acts infuriate outdoor enthusiasts, many of whom are otherwise fans of graffiti art.\n\n\"This is a very complex issue,\" said Casey Schreiner, editor of Modern Hiker. \"How different is graffiti in national parks than street art? If street art is OK, is this OK? Is there a correlation?\"\n\nSchreiner said his readers \"think it's a problem because graffiti begets graffiti, and they're seeing it in places they've never seen it before. National parks are special places for most Americans. Seeing them marked up is like getting punched in the gut.\"\n\nFederal officials say graffiti is surging in some parks, even as it has been declining in most others. Hardest hit are those near population centers, such as Golden Gate National Recreation Area in the Bay Area and Joshua Tree, which is a two-hour drive from Los Angeles and near Coachella Valley communities.\n\nIn Joshua Tree alone, graffiti artists vandalized the popular Rattlesnake Canyon in 2013, requiring an extensive cleanup; workers just finished removing etchings from the face of Barker Dam; and in February, someone painted a large, bright blue giraffe on a boulder in 49 Palms Oasis.\n\nAround the same time, someone painted a menacing 8-by-12-foot image of a skull on the wall of a historical structure in a nearby area known as the Wonderland of Rocks.\n\n\"That makes me sick,\" backpacker Steve Axthelm, 53, of Portland, Ore., muttered on a recent weekday as he surveyed the image.\n\nHumans have been leaving marks in nature since prehistoric tribes put silhouette hand prints on cave walls. Sourdoughs chipped their names into rocks during the California Gold Rush of 1848.\n\nThese days, public tolerance for tagging private property is spreading in cyberspace. Google recently launched a website touting street art around the world.\n\nBut graffiti artists tagging national parks are catering to a more irreverent online audience.\n\n'Devil's advocate'\n\n\"Playing devil's advocate, if provoking outrage is not part of your intention as a graffiti artist, why do it?\" Jeremy Cross, an artist and curator at the Night Gallery in Santa Ana, said with an impish grin.\n\n\"In the modern art climate, throwing graffiti up on a downtown wall is passe,\" Cross said. \"Tagging a national park ups the ante. Of course, you're setting yourself up for a public stigma -- and not a good one.\"\n\nImages posted by an artist whom federal authorities suspect is responsible for graffiti in eight national parks, including Joshua Tree, prompted an online petition at www.whitehouse.gov urging the Obama administration to take action.\n\nThe artist is believed to be Casey Nocket, 22, of New York, said Jeffrey G. Olson, a spokesman for the National Park Service. Evidence collected so far includes selfies of a young woman painting colorful face profiles on rocks and boulders resting on ridgelines with panoramic views.\n\nPark officials are trying to fight back with hidden video cameras and \"a new computer database that enables us to compare graffiti here with images popping up elsewhere, such as Zion National Park,\" said Joshua Tree park Superintendent David Smith.\n\nPassions run high\n\nThe hiking community is revving up its own policing. Schreiner said Modern Hiker never intended to become a conduit for investigating graffiti, but the issue has caught fire. \"So it's one of the things we do now, full time,\" he said.\n\nSchreiner added that passions run high, with some readers making \"blunt requests for the home addresses of perpetrators.\"\n\nAs the best-known artist who has tagged in a national park, Saraiva has become a favorite target ever since his signature \"OX\" mark -- revered when it adorns man-made structures -- popped up in Joshua Tree on a boulder the size of a large dog kennel.\n\nHe compounded his error by denying that the boulder was in the park. Answering critics, he posted on Instagram saying his work was \"made with love at friends privet back yard and not your national park!\"\n\nReaders then used Google satellite maps, latitude and longitude coordinates and their own field notes to pinpoint the boulder's exact location -- inside the park.\n\nFacing a torrent of criticism, Saraiva had scrawled, his lawyer acknowledged, what he described as an \"insignificant\" artistic expression on the rock, using water-based paint that was erased a few days later.\n\nThe attorney also demanded that Modern Hiker take down its article, saying it made Saraiva the target of \"oppressive and unjustified messages that seriously harm his professional and private life.\"\n\nOn April 1, Saraiva paid a fine of $275 to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, officials said. He could not be reached for comment.", "Where do America's most racist people live? \"The rural Northeast and South,\" suggests a new study just published in Plos One.\n\nThe paper introduces a novel but reasonable method for measuring the incidence of racist attitudes: Google search data. The methodology comes from data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz. He's used it before to measure the effect of racist attitudes on Barack Obama's electoral prospects.\n\n\"Google data, evidence suggests, are unlikely to suffer from major social censoring,\" Stephens-Davidowitz wrote in a previous paper. \"Google searchers are online and likely alone, both of which make it easier to express socially taboo thoughts. Individuals, indeed, note that they are unusually forthcoming with Google.\" He also notes that the Google measure correlates strongly with other standard measures social science researchers have used to study racist attitudes.\n\nThis is important, because racism is a notoriously tricky thing to measure. Traditional survey methods don't really work -- if you flat-out ask someone if they're racist, they will simply tell you no. That's partly because most racism in society today operates at the subconscious level, or gets vented anonymously online.\n\nFor the Plos One paper, researchers looked at searches containing the word n -- . People search frequently for it, roughly as often as searches for \"migraine(s),\" \"economist\" and \"sweater.\" (The authors attempted to control for variants of the racial epithet not intended as pejoratives, excluding the version of the word ending in \"a\" that analysis revealed was often used \"in different contexts compared to searches of the term ending in '-er.'\")\n\nIt's also important to note that not all people searching for the word n -- are motivated by racism, and that not all racists search for that word, either. But aggregated over several years and several million searches, the data give a pretty good approximation of where a particular type of racist attitude is the strongest.\n\nInterestingly, the most concentrated cluster of racist searches happened not in the South, but rather along the spine of the Appalachians running from Georgia all the way up to New York and southern Vermont.\n\nOther hotbeds of racist searches appear in areas of the Gulf Coast, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and a large portion of Ohio. But the searches get rarer the further West you go. West of Texas, no region falls into the \"much more than average\" category.", "Like C-3PO and R2-D2, some robot pairs are a match made in mechanized heaven. Now, a new team, Fetch and Freight, can eliminate much of the efficiency-botching human labor from warehouses, getting that Amazon shipment to your door faster than ever.\n\nIt's a system San Jose-based Fetch Robotics developed to help retailers be faster and more agile in their deliveries. Companies are adapting as online buying options like Amazon Prime, Google Express, and eBay Now have gotten more popular.\n\nFetch, the taller of the two, grabs goods with its product-picking arm and dumps 'em in Freight, the short, squat, bin bot that follows Fetch around and then scuttles items to the shipping area at speeds hitting three meters per second.\n\nThe duo can both be built upon the open source robot operating system, ROS. They work alongside human counterparts, eliminating the fleshbags' more mundane, time-sucking tasks like packing for delivery. And when they need juicing up, they cruise back to their charging stations automatically.\n\nBut Fetch's telescoping spine can only reach about five feet, and its back-drivable 7DOF arm can only lift about 13 pounds. Amazon, for example, already has robots of its own in its warehouses, and are far heavier lifters.\n\nBut what F&F lack in cargo-heaving brawn they make up for in adorable sidekick helpfulness. Plus, these guys (scheduled to ship later this year) can be plopped in any ol' warehouse, unlike Amazon's robot-filled ones, which require special shelving and infrastructure.\n\nEither way, more robots are going to staff warehouses in the near future: E-commerce sales hit over $300 billion last year, a 15 percent spike from 2013. The battle between Fetch and Freight versus brick and mortar has only just begun.", "Microsoft Microsoft is trying to reboot its mobile mojo -- yet again -- with a little help from the PC and a big assist from the folks who build the apps that run on its devices.\n\nIn an effort to court those developers, including many who have been lured by the larger opportunity offered by Apple's Apple's iOS and Google's Google's Android, Microsoft promised that its new operating system, Windows 10, will run on one billion devices in the next two to three years.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive developer platform ever,\" Terry Myerson, Microsoft's executive vice president of operating, said during a keynote at the company's Build conference for software developers. Windows 10 is expected to ship later this year.\n\nThe goal is attainable, especially when counting PCs, where Microsoft remains a powerhouse, said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead, president of Moore Insights and Strategy. Windows 10 will be able to run on the millions of PCs that currently run Windows 7 or Windows 8, and it will be pre-loaded into some 300 million new PCs that will ship in this year, according to estimates.\n\n\"Microsoft is trying to impress upon developers that it's bigger than iOS and Android. They have a much larger footprint,\" said Moorhead.\n\nOf course, it is in the mobile world where Microsoft is suffering, as Windows Phones account for a tiny fraction of the smartphone market. Microsoft is trying to get around that problem by erasing the lines between the mobile and PC world. The linchpin of that approach are Windows 10's universal apps, which will work any sized device, from phones to PCs and even the Xbox One game console and HoloLens, the company's new augmented reality device. Universal apps are intended to simplify life for the developers, who will be able to create one version of their software for all devices that use Microsoft's operating system-although there will be some additional coding necessary for transferring apps to Xbox and HoloLens.\n\nMicrosoft's boldest new move to resurrect its mobile fortunes was its announcement that iOS and Android developers will be able to use the same code to create version Windows versions of their apps. The move should drastically increase the number of apps that run on Windows phones.\n\nDevelopers still have to do some work to convert their apps. King Digital Entertainment has already used the iOS code for its hugely popular Candy Crush to create a Windows 10 app. Microsoft also showed off an Android version of the Choice Hotels app working on a Windows phone.\n\nMicrosoft's Biggest Hits And Flops\n\n\"Everybody thought hell would freeze over before Microsoft would do something like that,\" said Moorhead, referring to Microsoft opening up its development platform. \"It convinces everybody that Microsoft is in it to win it. They're willing to put all their sacrificial lambs out there. They're willing to do what it takes to thrive in a cloud and mobile world.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also making it easy for developers to move their older Windows applications -- those built on .Net and Win32 -- as well as Web apps written in Javascript to Windows 10.\n\nTo make developing for Windows more appealing, Microsoft will integrate its Windows Store and its artificial intelligence assistant Cortana more deeply in Windows 10. Windows 10 users will be able to control apps straight from the home screen using Cortana. For example, a user could communicate with a friend through the messaging app Viber by just commanding Cortana. The Windows Store will collect information about which apps you use and how you use them and then suggest other apps you might be interested in straight from the Start menu.\n\nMicrosoft is also working hard to make Windows 10 phones easier to use, especially in emerging markets. The company announced at Build that it will allow carrier billing in its Windows Store, so users will be able to buy apps using the mobile number rather than having to enter their credit card. That will be appealing to the millions of smartphone phone users in developing countries who don't have credits cards, said Myerson. Microsoft said 90 mobile operators around the world will support this carrier billing with the company.\n\n\"Windows 10 represents a new generation of Windows built for an era of more personal computing,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the conference. \"The mobility of the experience is what matters, not the mobility of the device.\"\n\nFollow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com", "Reddit Email Print Reprint\n\nSearch Jim Cramer's \"Mad Money\" trading recommendations using our exclusive \"Mad Money\" Stock Screener.\n\nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- With stocks, just like football, you never know who's going to win, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Wednesday. In today's trading, it was the underdogs that prevailed, as investors eschewed the safe stocks and bet big on everything else.\n\nThe market's tug-of-war is being played out on three fronts. First is a pending economic slowdown being brought on by the West Coast port shutdown and rising oil prices taking the lift out of American consumers. Second, there's oil itself, once again on the rise, crimping the economy ever so slowly. Third, there's the Federal Reserve, which continues to tell us that higher interest rates are coming soon.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend-Paying Stocks for 2015\n\nAll of these trends led to\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) turning in disappointing results, thanks to higher fuel costs and increased competition. Health care also fell out of favor; Humana (HUM) fell 7% when it didn't deliver on the quarter. Even Cramer fave Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) struggled with sluggish sales and higher costs.\n\nBut while all these fairly safe bets we're falling,\n\nStarwood Hotels (HOT) popped 8.3% on rumors the company is considering putting itself up for sale. Saleforce.com (CRM) shot up 11.6% on similar rumors. Even stocks like GoPro (GPRO), which investors had abandoned, soared 12.6% on strong sales that no one saw coming. Advice for the Tech Giants\n\nWith so much cheap money floating around Silicon Valley, Cramer donned his investment banker hat to offer up some advice for some major tech players.\n\nCramer felt that\n\nGoogle (GOOGL - Get Report), a stock he owns for his charitable trust, Action Alerts PLUS, should snap up Twitter (TWTR), another Action Alerts PLUS name, while the company is down on its luck. Google, after all, can afford to wait for Twitter to monetize itself, just as it has with YouTube.\n\nSpeaking of YouTube, Cramer suggested\n\nGoogle should start acquiring the rights to stream major sporting events, including commentary, and put all those assets onto YouTube, making it an even great video powerhouse.\n\nNext up, Cramer had some advice for\n\nYahoo! (YHOO) and Priceline (PCLN), two companies flush with cash. Here he suggested buying GrubHub (GRUB) along with the privately held Postmates and Yelp (YELP), a powerful combination that would make the acquiring company a one-stop shop for travel and dining.\n\nMust Read: Exxon, Other Oil Company Earnings to Show Some Hope in the Bad News\n\n1 of 2", "The market is a battle out there right now and while it might look fairly placid on the surface, Jim Cramer sees forces at work that are crushing the stocks of perfectly healthy companies.\n\nThere are three macro themes in particular that the \"Mad Money\" host thinks are causing stocks to react dramatically. They either fly high or crash, depending on how the company itself is doing.\n\nThe first issue is that there is a huge slowdown happening. On Wednesday morning, gross domestic product reportedly gained just a miniscule 0.2 percent, versus the 1 percent expected. That is the smallest growth that Cramer has seen in ages. And yes, there was a West Coast slowdown and bad weather. But the U.S. is a huge country!\n\n\"I don't have a good excuse for this hideous number other than that there was less business being done than we thought,\" Cramer said\n\nThe second force at work is that oil is done going down, which means gas goes back up. Back in January, Cramer said the floor had been reached at $43, and it did. Oil has now been headed higher, thanks to the dollar that has stopped gaining strength.\n\nThe third force behind the scenes is that the Fed said it will raise interest rates later this year, and it didn't nix that theory when it issued a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAnd while there were major themes at work, Cramer thinks the market appeared placid on the surface because there was a ton of takeover talk on Wednesday. There was what Cramer thinks is a total rumor that Salesforce.com may have contacted bankers to sell itself.\n\n\"This one's difficult for me to swallow and not just because Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO, spent yesterday afternoon showing me a mock-up of the 60-story tower that he's building for his burgeoning tech team,\" Cramer said.\n\nAfter interviewing the CEO on Tuesday, Cramer thinks Benioff plans on going it alone. Given the $47 billion market cap of Salesforce, Cramer suspects it would be a very expensive and unlikely acquisition if the rumor that Oracle were to acquire the company would come true.\n\n\"But, as I've seen in my week out here in San Francisco, this is a city of dreams that do sometimes come true,\" Cramer added.\n\nRead MoreCramer: 3 huge forces that are crushing stocks\n\nAt the risk of sounding like an East Coast banker, Cramer thinks this is exactly what is needed right now.\n\n\"I have been talking to too many companies that I would salivate to snap up and put together if I were running a huge company, that can borrow money for next to nothing or use its stock to make acquisitions,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nSo what should these big companies do?\n\nFor starters, Cramer thinks Google could use some help. The company is sitting on way too much cash, but it also has an amazing search capability. Yet, it also has YouTube as an asset, and it hasn't figured out how to make money with it.\n\nGoogle should buy its partner Twitter. This is a logical sale in Cramer's perspective, given the disastrous management team at Twitter that can't seem to figure out how to monetize its own product.\n\nThe second step is for Google to buy the rights to every major sporting event that happens. Then it should stream those events on YouTube with instant commentary coming from Twitter. That will accommodate the lack of any social component missing on Google. Then it should charge a licensing fee to companies with employees who tweet and create some vicious commercial revenues.\n\nVoila! Twitter and Google, theoretically two birds taken care of with one stone.\n\nRead More Cramer: Turn Google into a goldmine...with Twitter\n\nOne of those innovative companies is San Francisco-based Postmates, a private company that provides on-demand delivery service for 67 markets around the country. Some might even call it the Uber for couriers, because you can use its mobile app to get practically anything delivered within an hour for a small fee.\n\nMany are wondering if Postmates will take share from Amazon, as it can now provide delivery from small-businesses around the community that previously did not offer that service.\n\nAnd while Postmates is not a public company, the large players have started to take note, as it recently secured big deals with both Starbucks and Chipotle.\n\nWant your burrito bowl delivered to you with your favorite Starbucks latte? No problem!\n\nCramer spoke with Postmates co-founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann on how it managed to score these big deals and what makes it different from any other courier service.\n\n\"The idea behind Postmates is what if you can use the city as a warehouse,\" Lehmann said.\n\nRead MoreCramer -- Death to Amazon? Postmates boosts local biz\n\nLast month, the red hot biotech stocks came to a screeching halt, and Cramer warned investors that the development-stage players in the space could become way too risky.\n\nHowever, there is one development-stage biotech that Cramer still likes. Receptos is currently developing the drug Ozanimod, which was a groundbreaking pill for multiple sclerosis that is in Phase 3 trials. It also could work for various other autoimmune conditions, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\nWith the stock stalled recently, could this be a great entry point? To find out, Cramer spoke with Receptos CEO Faheem Hasnain.\n\n\"We raised about $700 million last year, so we are in a very good cash position, and that really gives us the ability to move these programs forward,\" Hasnain said.\n\nAnother hot privately held company out there is one that delivers groceries. Instacart was valued at $2 billion in its most recent round of fundraising. It lets you order groceries online by connecting customers with thousands of personal shoppers who will collect the items from a local supermarket and deliver to your door in exchange for a small delivery fee, sometimes with a small markup.\n\nThe company was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, a former supply chain engineer from Amazon. It has quickly expanded into 15 markets across the country and has even partnered with large grocery chains such as Whole Foods, Costco and newly added Petco.\n\nTo find out more about Intacart's innovation, Cramer sat down with CEO Apoorva Mehta.\n\n\"We have found that there is customers who have always wanted groceries delivered to their door, and they wanted it in one hour, two hours in the same day. And the fact is, that has never been able to be done before,\" Mehta said.\n\nEdward Lifesciences Corp: \"Give it a little room, it's had a big run. We are going to let that stock come down, and then we will do some buying.\"\n\nUnited Technologies Corp: \"Look, I like United Technologies, I have it in my charitable trust. But 70 percent? No way. No more than 20 percent of your portfolio should be in one stock.\"", "For the first time since 2011, Apple has made more money from selling desktops and notebooks than iPads. So does this mean the PC is making a comeback?\n\nEver since Steve Jobs walked onto the stage of the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts on Jan 27, 2010 and introduced the first iPad to the world, analysts have been talking about the death of the PC.\n\nAnd while the tablet's popularity exploded at a rate never before experienced in the history of consumer electronics - Gartner claims 229 million were sold in 2014 alone - sales are not only cooling, it looks as if the computer might actually be making a comeback.\n\nIn amongst the numbers regarding huge iPhone sales and information about being swamped with demand for its first smartwatch, Apple's latest quarterly earning figures show that its computer sales are also up - considerably.\n\nApple sold 4.6 million Macs over the last three months - a 10% year-on-year increase - and those figures only run to the end of March, meaning that they don't include sales of its latest notebooks, which didn't go on sale until April 10.\n\nThe company sold 12.3 million iPads over the same period but, for the first time since 2011, Apple has made more in revenues from its PCs than from its tablets.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple doesn't differentiate between notebook and desktop sales when presenting its figures, but the signs suggest its portable PCs are seeing a boost in popularity.\n\nAccording to Digitimes' Asian supply chain sources, notebook shipments are expected to grow 11% over the next quarter and this upturn is being driven by demand for MacBooks and Google's Chromebooks.\n\nThe publication's own research, published ahead of Apple's figures, correctly forecast higher Mac sales and even Gartner, whose latest report into the state of the PC industry - published on April 9 - is positive about notebooks, convertibles and hybrid computers, despite painting a grim picture for the immediate future of the desktop.\n\n\"PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality. Our early study suggests strong growth of hybrid notebooks, especially in mature markets, in 1Q15,\" said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner.\n\nAs well as the re-emergence of the notebook, 2015 could still also be the year that the tablet gets a new lease on life.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple is developing a larger, productivity-focused tablet - that the press has dubbed the iPad Pro - which is expected to boast a 12in display and offer computing power on a par with an ultrabook PC.\n\nHowever, when the company chooses to release it is anyone's guess.", "HughPickens.com writes: Google has announced Password Alert, a free, open-source Chrome extension that protects your Google Accounts from phishing attacks.

News about the devastating earthquake and its effects were immediately seen on TV and celebrities have also taken it upon themselves to express support and urge its fans to offer support.\n\nCelebrities tweeted their support to the victims of the earthquake. Bryan Adams, Missy Elliot, Pink and Mandy Moore expressed their thoughts and prayers for the victims of the tragedy. Other celebrities directed their twitter followers to links and text numbers where they could donate to Red Cross, United Nations and other Non-Government Organizations. Stars such as Zoe Zaldana and singer Ricky Martin provided links on how their fans could help.\n\nThe force of the April 25 (Saturday) earthquake was so widespread and strong that it was even felt in some places in Northern India. Hundreds of missing people were immediately reported and death toll continue to rise. As of this writing, the death toll in Nepal is already more than 5,000. Help from UN, its local government and other non-government organizations is steadily coming in.\n\nThe devastation in the country of Nepal did not go unnoticed because of its effects not only because its effects in Kathmandu -- considered the cultural and political capital of Nepal. The devastation of the earthquake has also reached Mount Everest as its base was hit by an avalanche.\n\nThere were survivors after the avalanche but there were also reported 10 due to the disaster. Notable among the victims is Dan Fredinburg. Although he is not a household name, he is well known in the tech community for his role in Google.\n\nDan Fredinburg was an executive of the search engine giant and one of the heads of Google X project. Sofia Bush and Scooter Braun remembered the Google Executive through social media.\n\nUNICEF, Red Cross, Save the Children, Doctors without Borders and other Non-government organizations are now accepting donations. The donations directly funds support for the victims of the devastating earthquake.

Rand Paul is running for the GOP presidential nomination -- and he's also vying for the title of \"biggest net neutrality hater.\"\n\nPaul, the Kentucky Republican, has introduced a resolution designed to torpedo the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules, in the latest GOP assault on the new open internet policy.\n\nOpen internet advocates call the measure a political stunt that demonstrates a basic ignorance of how the internet works -- and is likely to alienate young, tech-savvy voters and potential Silicon Valley donors who strongly support net neutrality.\n\n\"Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are competing to be most clueless person on the internet,\" said Marvin Ammori, a tech policy lawyer and leading net neutrality advocate, referring to Cruz's infamous description of net neutrality as \"Obamacare\" for the internet. \"Is this how they intend to court millennials?\"\n\nThe \"resolution of disapproval,\" which Paul introduced in the Senate on Wednesday, is a companion to a similar measure introduced in the House two weeks ago by Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican from Georgia.\n\nPaul's measure is the latest salvo in a multi-pronged legal and political attack being waged by the telecom industry and its allies on Capitol Hill against the FCC's rules, which were passed by the FCC in February. The new policy is designed to prevent internet giants like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon from blocking or discriminating against rival internet services, or establishing online fast lanes for deep pocketed content companies.\n\nThe nation's largest cable and telecom companies and their allies in Congress loathe the new rules, which they claim amount to a government takeover that will harm the internet.\n\n\"This regulation by the FCC is a textbook example of Washington's desire to regulate anything and everything, and will do nothing more than wrap the Internet in red-tape,\" Paul said in a statement. \"The internet has successfully flourished without the heavy hand of government interference. Stated simply, I do not want to see the government regulating the internet.\"\n\nNet neutrality supporters, including President Obama, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, dozens of public interest groups, and hundreds of tech companies -- from Silicon Valley titans to tiny startups -- say the policy is necessary to maintain an open and level internet playing field, so that the next Google, Skype, or Netflix is able to flourish.\n\nMatt Wood, policy director at Free Press Action Fund, a DC-based public interest group, said that Paul, a first-term senator who worked as an ophthalmologist before entering Congress, doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"Senator Paul has no idea what net neutrality is,\" said Wood. \"His opposition to common-sense open internet principles shows how little he knows or cares about the law and the overwhelming support these rules have from businesses, innovators, and individual internet users.\"\n\nA recent poll conducted by Vox Populi Polling found that 81 percent of voters nationwide -- including 81 percent of Republicans -- believe that \"it is critical to maintain\" an internet where service providers cannot block or discriminate against content, or strike \"paid prioritization deals,\" which are principles at the heart of the FCC's new rules.\n\nDespite significant public support for net neutrality, many GOP lawmakers have seized on the issue to demonstrate their ideological opposition to what they call \"federal government overreach,\" and attack a policy that is strongly favored by Obama.\n\nPaul, who has cultivated a reputation as a libertarian and even accepts Bitcoin donations for his campaign, seems to think that opposing net neutrality allows him to bolster his small government, anti-regulation bonafides, while appealing to the Tea Party wing of the GOP primary electorate, which is highly suspicious of the federal government.\n\nBut the Kentucky senator risks alienating the technology community, a constituency that he has been aggressively courting. Last month, Paul ventured to the South by Southwest festival, where he professed his \"love\" for the tech community, used Snapchat and Meerkat to chronicle his Austin exploits, and said he \"had a great time jamming with Mark Ronson at the Pandora party.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that Snapchat, Meerkat and Pandora are all examples of online services that net neutrality supporters say could be at risk without strong open internet protections. If blocking, throttling or fast lanes were allowed, giant internet service providers could disadvantage these companies in favor of their own rival services.\n\n\"It's almost ironic to see such strong opposition to net neutrality coming from a candidate who is so heavily courting the technology community,\" said Julie Samuels, executive director of Engine, a nonprofit group that represents tech startups and supports net neutrality. \"It appears Mr. Paul has a serious misconception about the community he's trying so hard to win over.\"\n\nPaul's anti-net neutrality resolution, which was introduced under the Congressional Review Act, would declare that the FCC's new open internet policy \"shall have no force or effect.\" The Congressional Review Act, which was passed in 1996 as part of Newt Gingrich's \"Contract With America,\" allows lawmakers to overrule new regulations within 60 days of their publication in the Federal Register. The FCC's new open internet rules were published two weeks ago.\n\nPaul and Collins' joint resolution of disapproval, which can pass both the Senate and the House with a simple majority, would face an almost certain veto from President Obama, which suggests that the measure is what's known in DC as a \"messaging bill\" that's primarily designed to appeal to the GOP base.\n\nWood, policy director at Free Press, called the anti-net neutrality campaign advanced by Paul and his allies \"all bluster.\"\n\n\"Egged on by industry lobbyists, these congresspeople think they can fool people into believing that net neutrality threatens investment and innovation in digital networks,\" said Wood. \"They insist that it's a government takeover of the internet when nothing could be further from the truth.\"", "Unethical abuse of communication is not new. The rabbinic scholar, Rabbeinu Gershom, lived a thousand years ago and was considered one of the earliest and greatest scholars of the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Known as \"The Light of the Exile,\" Rabbeinu Gershom enacted a number of new rules for his generation. These new rules, called \"takanot,\" would only have been created if there was a reason. One of his more famous takanot was a prohibition against reading other people's mail. Letters back then contained sensitive business information which could be very harmful if read by an outsider, so Rabbeinu Gershom legislated against reading other people's mail as a safeguard against this immoral practice.\n\nA thousand years later, unethical hackers are breaking into computer networks to read innocent people's mail. In today's age, the mail is electronic and no rabbinic decree or security software is capable of blocking a determined hacker from intrusion into our privacy. Internet hackers are striking several times a minute around the world and anyone with an internet connection is at risk.\n\nArguably, the most well-known company of the Digital Age is Google, whose mantra is \"Don't be evil.\" If everyone adopted this precept, we would have no need for Norton, Kaspersky or Mcafee -- all multi-million dollar companies creating new secure ways to stop hacking, malware, online identity theft and viruses. Big companies, small companies and the little old lady down the street are all vulnerable to being hacked.\n\nWe've all read about the larger online hacking debacles of the past couple years. In late 2013, Target Corp. lost 40 million credit card numbers to Russian-speaking hackers. After that hackers broke into the servers of Home Depot, Adobe Systems, Chase, eBay and Anthem. If you do business with any of these companies there was a good chance your personal data was violated. Then, of course, there was the much publicized hacking of Sony, in which the personal email messages of many Hollywood actors and executives were compromised.\n\nOn the smaller scale of email hacking, which hits closer to home for many, is when your private email account is attacked and thousands of email messages are sent to everyone in your contact database without your knowledge. In some cases the email message might be a scam, stating that you've been stranded in a remote location far from home and need some money wired to you. In other instances, your email might be hacked to provide access into your Facebook account or even your online banking account, causing fraudulent abuse of your finances. These violations of privacy are becoming more commonplace.\n\nSometimes the hacking occurs by taking advantage of our better judgment. One woman told me that she recently received an email explaining there was a dangerous file on her computer that had to be deleted at once. She was not sure of the validity of such an odd message, but became concerned that this file could wipe out her data -- including thousands of digital photos of her family's vacations. She went ahead and removed this essential Windows system file causing her computer to stop working. Over the years, I've seen dozens of people suffer with anxiety after a virus has corrupted their computer data. This data loss is more than simply a hassle; it's a violation of privacy and the theft of ones possessions.\n\nWe've come to regard spam email as simply a nuisance, but in truth these messages constitute a virus. Each second of our lives that we use to delete an email from a Saudi Prince who needs to transfer a few million dollars into our bank account is our time that is stolen from us. Each second of our lives that we have to decipher whether the \"secure\" message from our bank is legitimate or an attempt at phishing is more time stolen from us. The minutes we take out of our busy day to visit Snopes.com to determine whether the urgent email we received from a friend is a hoax or a legitimate concern is time wasted. These are unnecessary intrusions.\n\nSomeone neglects to sign out of their email account while in an Internet Cafe out of the country has their email hacked and unintentionally sends out thousands of email messages to friends, relatives and business contacts with an attached file that contains a virus. Even if only a handful of recipients open the risky file, the hassle that has been caused is significant and can lead to data loss, hours of time wasted, financial setback and considerable anxiety. We are all victims of this pernicious activity on the Web and since there's no end in sight to this unethical abuse, we all must become more vigilant.\n\nEarlier this month, one of my personal websites was hacked into by a hacking team in France that uploaded over 3 million spam comments to the website. These hackers created their own user account to the website in order to advertise fake designer sunglasses and menswear. It took hours for me to recover my website and return it to normal functionality, not to mention the unnecessary frustration. Already this year my technology company has had to recover several websites of Jewish organizations that have been hacked by anti-Semitic groups. These hackers replace the websites of synagogues and Jewish nonprofits with their messages of hate and violence.\n\nIn the Digital Age, we all use the Internet and we are thus all susceptible to the malicious threats of hackers. Individuals and businesses are threatened on a daily basis with computer viruses, malware and identity theft. Critical files are held ransom if the business owner doesn't send a money order to these nefarious individuals. Email messages can never be secure enough to be kept private from those intent on phishing our data. With all of the benefits of technology, we live in fear that our passwords aren't strong enough, our data not backed up enough, and our online financial transactions are not encrypted enough. We continue to be inundated with spam and scams, hoaxes and hacks.\n\nSo what is the remedy for this dark side of technology? We should look to the wisdom of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. Zuckerberg, explains that at his company they have cultivated a unique culture and management approach called the Hacker Way. In fact, \"Hacker Way\" is the main street on which Facebook's headquarters are located. \"The word 'hacker,' he says, \"has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things, it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers I've met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world.\"\n\nHacker culture, Zuckerberg claims, is extremely open and meritocratic. I believe that in the interest of creating a more ethical Internet, we must reclaim the idea of hacking for good. Rather than falling prey to the evil hackers who seek to take advantage of people through the Internet, we must invest in those who look for positive hacking initiatives.\n\nWe must remain vigilant to secure our online data and networks and encourage others to do so as well. The time and money we spend to defend the Internet from evil is a waste and could be used for good. As the Internet grows and matures, I hope morality wins.", "When cooled down to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, the four dark elements at the center of the circuit in the middle of this image can represent digital data using quantum mechanical effects.\n\nA superconducting chip developed at IBM demonstrates an important step needed for the creation of computer processors that crunch numbers by exploiting the weirdness of quantum physics. If successfully developed, quantum computers could effectively take shortcuts through many calculations that are difficult for today's computers.\n\nIBM's new chip is the first to integrate the basic devices needed to build a quantum computer, known as qubits, into a 2-D grid. Researchers think one of the best routes to making a practical quantum computer would involve creating grids of hundreds or thousands of qubits working together. The circuits of IBM's chip are made from metals that become superconducting when cooled to extremely low temperatures. The chip operates at only a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.\n\nIBM's chip contains only the simplest grid possible, four qubits in a two-by-two array. But previously researchers had only shown they could operate qubits together when arranged in a line. Unlike conventional binary bits, a qubit can enter a \"superposition state\" where it is effectively both 0 and 1 at the same time. When qubits in this state work together, they can cut through complex calculations in ways impossible for conventional hardware. Google, NASA, Microsoft, IBM, and the U.S. government are all working on the technology.\n\nThere are different ways to make qubits, with superconducting circuits like those used by IBM and Google being one of the most promising. However, all qubits suffer from the fact that the quantum effects they use to represent data are very susceptible to interference. Much current work is focused on showing that small groups of qubits can detect when errors have occurred so they can be worked around or corrected.\n\nEarlier this year, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Google announced that they had made a chip with nine superconducting qubits arranged in a line (\"Google Researchers Make Quantum Computing Components More Reliable\"). Some of the qubits in that system could detect when their fellow devices suffered a type of error called a bit-flip, where a qubit representing a 0 changes to a 1 or vice versa.\n\nHowever, qubits also suffer from a second kind of error known as a phase flip, where a qubit's superposition state becomes distorted. Qubits can only detect that in other qubits if they are working together in a 2-D array, says Jay Gambetta, who leads IBM's quantum computing research group at its T.J. Watson research center in Yorktown Heights, New York.\n\nA paper published today details how IBM's chip with four qubits arranged in a square can detect both bit and phase flips. One pair of qubits is checked for errors by the other pair of qubits. One of the pair doing the checking looks for bit flips and the other for phase flips.\n\n\"This is a stepping stone toward demonstrating a larger square,\" says Gambetta. \"There will be other challenges that emerge as the square gets bigger, but it looks very optimistic for the next few steps.\"\n\nGambetta says his team had to carefully design its new chip to overcome interference problems caused by putting the four qubits so close together. They are already experimenting with a chip that has a grid of eight qubits in a two-by-four rectangle, he says.\n\nRaymond Laflamme, director of the institute for quantum computing at the University of Waterloo, Canada, describes IBM's results as \"an important milestone [toward] reliable quantum processors.\" Tackling errors is one of the field's most important problems. \"Quantum computing promises to have many mind-boggling applications, but it is hindered by the fragility of quantum information.\"\n\nTruly solving that problem requires going one step further than IBM's latest results, and correcting qubit errors as well as detecting them. That can only be demonstrated on a larger grid of qubits, says Laflamme. However, not all quantum computing researchers think that qubits like those being built at IBM, Google, and elsewhere will ever be workable in large collections. Researchers at Microsoft and Bell Labs are working to create a completely different design of qubit that should be less prone to errors in the first place (see \"Microsoft's Quantum Mechanics\").", "In a detailed, 3-hour long keynote address at Microsoft's Build Conference, CEO Satya Nadella and company spelled out the software giant's vision for the future, revealing more features of its upcoming Windows 10 operating system, its new Edge browser and its Windows Holographic platform. Though a lot of the announcements were targeted at developers and corporate IT departments, there are also plenty of real-world implications for mainstream consumers. These are the five takeaways from Microsoft Build and why you should care about them.\n\nEver since it first announced Windows 10 last fall, Microsoft has been talking about how the new OS will change its interface to work on devices of all sizes, from smartphones to tablets to desktop computers. The preview builds of Windows 10 have made it easy to switch your PC back and forth between between touch-friendly \"tablet mode\" and mouse-friendly \"desktop mode.\"\n\nBut what about smartphones? At Build, Microsoft Corporate VP of Operating Systems Joe Belfiore revealed that handsets running Windows 10 will be able to output a full desktop UI when attached to an external monitor via HDMI, a feature called Continuum. During a demo, he showed a Windows Phone connected to a keyboard and mouse and running the regular Windows environment, complete with a Start menu that mirrored the live tile layout of the phone's home screen. I was particularly impressed when he explained that he could view different content -- a text messaging app, for example -- on the phone screen than on the monitor, effectively providing a dual-screen experience.\n\nWhy You Should Care: In an era where you can fit a full Windows PC on a stick, why not turn your phone into one? For users with modest needs, a smartphone could be their only device for work and play. There are many places in the world where millions of people have smartphones, but very few buy computers so this could open up a whole new world for those users.\n\nThe idea of docking your phone and turning it into a computer isn't a new one. Motorola famously failed with its Atrix 4G phone, which brought up a browser-only OS when you plugged it into a $300 keyboard dock. Unlike prior attempts, Microsoft is promising a full fledged Windows experience powered by the phone. However, it's unlikely that the phones will run desktop (aka Win32) apps, because those require an x86 processor and all Windows Phones use ARM processors.\n\nThough it has more than 500,000 phone apps available, Windows lags way behind Android and iOS, both in quality of apps and volume. Microsoft hopes to lure more developers to Windows 10 by making it much easier to move their apps over. During the keynote, Microsoft's Terry Myerson showed how a new version of Visual Studio can code in Java, the language of Android apps, or Objective C, the language of iOS. He explained that developers can copy the code from their existing apps into Visual Studio and, with minor changes, compile it for Windows 10.\n\nWhy You Should Care: If you're a developer who already writes Android and/or iOS apps, you should be able to create Windows versions of those apps with little effort. However, if you're an end user, the benefits are much murkier. You can hope that your favorite apps get ported to Windows 10, but there's no guarantee that the right developers will bite. You can't just take an app from your phone and port it yourself.\n\nLarger publishers are probably looking for a more catered, native experience and will design their Windows apps from the ground up anyway. Google has steadfastly refused to create Windows versions of its apps, but that probably has nothing to do with the difficulty of coding separate versions of Gmail. Remember that developers still have to support, test, submit and market their apps so porting is never effortless, even if all the features work. However, small companies may find that they can now add windows versions of their apps without hiring additional programmers.\n\nMicrosoft's upcoming Windows Holographic platform just keeps getting more exciting. At the keynote, Microsoft exec Alex Kipman showed a new demo of the HoloLens, Microsoft's headset which lets you place virtual objects on top of your real-world field of view. In the demo, a Microsoft employee named Darren put a variety of applications in different parts of his apartment, with a weather model on a coffee table and a video player on the wall. When Darren walked around the room, he told the video player to follow him and it moved along the wall next to him so he could keep watching; he could also increase or decrease the size of the video player at will.\n\nLater in the keynote, another Microsoft product manager came on stage with a robot that had wheels but no torso or head. Through her HoloLens glasses, the product manager could see a virtual head and arms on top of the real robot as well as control panels floating on either side of the robot. That allowed her to interact with the robot, even helping it navigate around the room.\n\nWhy You Should Care: It could take a few years to go mainstream, but augmented reality is in your future. Today, AR apps such as Wikitude and Google Goggles use your phone to project graphical information on top of the world. In the near future, the virtual objects you use will be apps, and your home will be the UI. AR will touch every aspect of modern life. Elementary school students will learn about dinosaurs by interacting with virtual exhibits while plumbers look at diagrams projected on top of your pipes. Backed by Microsoft, Windows Holographic has the best chance of dominating this emerging space.\n\nMORE: HoloLens Finally Makes Augmented Reality Real\n\nTo help developers succeed and the ecosystem grow, Microsoft plans to push app purchases and downloads in various parts of the Windows 10 UI. For example, when Joe Belfiore searched for \"Star Wars,\" using the search box, his top result was Star Wars: Commander, an app from the store rather than something already installed on his device. This feature works in the most recent preview build of Windows 10 and even pulls up store recommendations when you have apps that match your query already installed. For example, I searched for \"word\" and was shown both a shortcut for \"Wordpad\" and promotions for Word Search Saga and Words with Friends in the Windows store.\n\nThe lock screen will also display app promotions in Windows 10. Belfiore showed a lock screen with wallpaper that looked like a tablet with pen, which promoted downloading Fresh Paint, a drawing app, from the store.\n\nWhy You Should Care: On the one hand, you'll have an easier time discovering apps you might really like in Windows 10. On the other hand, the OS will be trying to sell you things as you use everyday functions like search and unlock. So far, at least, the promotions don't seem too obtrusive or annoying.\n\nWe've known for a couple of months now that Microsoft plans to replace Internet Explorer with a new browser that's lighter and more standards compliant. Though it was called \"Project Spartan\" as a working title, the app is now known as (drum roll please) . . . Microsoft Edge. More importantly, we learned that the new browser will support browser extensions built with HTML and Javascript, the same types of extensions that Chrome and Firefox run today. Belfiore showed a Reddit extension that he took from the Chrome store and managed to get working on Edge with minor changes.\n\nWhy You Should Care: If you use Windows 10, you're going to see the Edge browser and Microsoft will undoubtedly promote it heavily. The jury is still out on its performance and usability as the current Project Spartan beta is slower and uglier than the competition. Browser extensions are really important in 2015 so it's good that Microsoft is finally supporting them.", "Things are starting to get more exciting in the Android smartphone world these days. LG have just launched the new G4 and while it won't be featured in this list until it hits shelves, it'll certainly make an impact later this year. As for May however, well there are still some excellent options out there no matter what sort of Android smartphone you're looking for, and the flagships of 2015 are here, ready and waiting for you to pick them up at your local carrier store or from Amazon. This list is of the device available in North America right now, and next month's list should be very interesting, indeed.\n\nWhat was once some sort of big movement in the smartphone industry, the OnePlus One is just another Android smartphone. In that it's now easier than ever to get a hold of, and as things with Cyanogen didn't go down too well, it won't have the Cyanogen branding too much longer. The device is a 5.5-inch 1080p affair powered by a Snapdragon 801 and while the hardware is still pretty solid, it's becoming harder to stay a loyal fan of the OnePlus One what with recent delays in their new Oxygen OS, but for enthusiasts and those looking for a different route, the OnePlus One won't disappoint.\n\nWhile the Xperia Z3 is an excellent device, it's fairly tough to get hold of in the US - unless you're a T-Mobile customer - and compared to other devices from the second half of 2014, the Xperia Z3 didn't go quite as far as it could have. It stuck with the Snapdragon 801, 3GB of RAM and 5.2-inch display that the Xperia Z2 launched with this time last year, and it didn't change much at all from the overall experience. Still, if you want a Sony device, the Xperia Z3 has nice, fairly untouched software (complete with a recent upgrade to Lollipop) and it's a well-built smartphone. The Xperia Z3 has recently just been \"relaunched\" on T-Mobile at a lower price point, and now makes for attractive smartphone purchase.\n\nThe Moto X (2014) is an excellent smartphone, and if you're just looking for something that looks nice and has down to Earth software on it, then look no further. After the recent launch of the G4, Motorola was keen to remind everyone that they've been doing leather for a lot longer, and they don't just offer leather, they also offer bamboo and other wood options, too. However, if you want a better camera experience, some more exciting software features and a better display, then there are other options out there. With Moto Maker though, you can choose from wood, leather and a myriad of color options, so if you want a great smartphone to live with that doesn't try too hard to be anything more than it is, the Moto X (2014) will be just what you're looking for.\n\nLG's G Flex 2 was one of the first devices to be announced in 2015, and also one of the first with a Snapdragon 810. In a fetching new red color, the 5.5-inch curvy smartphone looks great, however it's not quite the smartphone we were hoping it to be. Following in the footsteps of the original G Flex, which offered a phone that you could genuinely flex and had a curved display from top-to-bottom, the Plastic OLED flexible panel just doesn't do enough to feel worth it right now. The Snapdragon 810 inside the G Flex 2 doesn't perform as we'd like and it's sadly not what we were expecting from LG this time around. Our review can be found here.\n\nThe DROID Turbo is a classic case of that carrier exclusive smartphone you wish was available elsewhere. Not only does the DROID Turbo look great, but the 5.2-inch Quad HD display, Snapdragon 805 and a massive 3,900 mAh make this a smartphone to admire. It's exclusive to Verizon's network, which may or may not be the deal breaker for you here, but if their network has never let you down and you're happy paying a little extra, then this could be the best device available on Verizon. For a lot of people, the DROID Turbo has all the specs the Moto X should have launched with, and for those on Verizon, you can tap into those specs.\n\nLG just recently announced the G4, and while it bests the G3 in pretty much every major way, the G3 was already a tough phone to beat. It might feature a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, but the device is physically quite small thanks to some wizardry on LG's part. The curved back and rear-mounted buttons help make the G3 feel good in the hand and while the Snapdragon 801 is arguably not as well suited to a Quad HD display as the Snapdragon 805, there's more than enough grunt in the G3 for the majority of users. Even in the face of 1080p displays though, the LG G3's Quad HD display was never all that nice to look at outside of all those pixels. Still, it's led LG to some of their best quarters in company history, so it's clearly done the job!\n\nThe HTC One M9 was recently released, and as we discovered in our review there isn't all that much to write home about. This is when we're talking about the HTC One M8 of course, but the M9 is a Snapdragon 810 powered device with 3GB of RAM and a 5.0-inch 1080p display and it's just as good-looking as last year's model. The camera is the biggest change this year with a 20.7-megapixel sensor instead of an UltraPixel sensor. The camera is a high point here, as is the excellent build quality, but if you were hoping for something a little newer, then there are other options to consider.\n\nAs massive smartphones go, the Nexus 6 is one of the better built and more fully featured out there, it's a great device that shows off what stock Android is capable of, but it is a little pricey. With a Snapdragon 805, 3GB of RAM and a Quad HD display, this holds up as one of the most powerful devices available, even in the face of the Snapdragon 810. With stock Android onboard you're assured speedy updates and it's a good phone for those looking to tinker and mess around with Android as well. The Nexus 6 is also the only smartphone that can enjoy Google's vision for what a wireless network could be, Project Fi, so it recently gained one more string to its bow. It might be pricey, but if you're interested in a powerful, well built Android smartphone the Nexus 6 is a great way to go.\n\nOne of the few devices available that takes a stylus and turns it into an exceptionally useful tool, the Galaxy Note 4 is one hell of a smartphone, especially if you want something with a larger display. The 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display is bright, colorful and the Snapdragon 805 under the hood works great, too. A device for those needing to get something done, the Galaxy Note 4 is an excellent follow-up to the Galaxy Note 3.\n\nSamsung have outdone themselves this year with the launch of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. Yes, there's no longer a removable battery or microSD card slot, but what you gain is a metal build that feels excellent in the hand. Plus, this is the one device that will buck the trend this year of using a Snapdragon processor and instead uses Samsung's Exynos 7420 with great results. It looks good, the color options are great and the camera is vastly improved upon. The Galaxy S6 Edge is essentially the same phone with sloped edges either side. As of right now, these don't do too much but over time, developers will harness this new hardware for all sorts of new features. The Galaxy S6 duo are the best smartphones that Samsung have ever made and the fact that they eschew the Snapdragon 810 which is rare misstep for Qualcomm makes the Galaxy S6 one of the devices to buy in 2015. Our review of this duo can be found here.", "Today at its annual developer conference, Microsoft revealed \"Microsoft Edge\" as the name of its latest web browser that you won't use. Previously codenamed \"Project Spartan,\" Microsoft Edge is a streamlined Internet Explorer successor that will bring features such as built-in annotations to Explorer's customer base of confused senior citizens and corporate worker bees who are not allowed to install software on their work computers.\n\nMicrosoft hailed the newly christened browser with a \"sizzle reel\" video that invites users to \"blur the edge ... between standing still and moving forward,\" an act formerly known as leaning. The video shows glimpses of the many enhancements that you will blithely forgo as you instead browse the web using Chrome, Firefox, or maybe even Opera. Those innovations include integration of Cortana (Microsoft's digital assistant) and tabs that show you pictures of webpages as you mouse over them. The Cortana features look somewhat handy: In Microsoft's demo, for instance, Cortana finds the hours and location of a restaurant that the user is researching, and the assistant does so seemingly without being asked. That's sort of creepy, but all the inoffensive browser features have already been invented; the only ones left are the creepy ones. Hell, Chrome is basically Google spyware that happens to also function as a web browser.\n\nLess practical than Cortana are the aforementioned annotations, which allow you to draw notes on web pages as you view them. These scribbles are shareable, a welcome feature in the theoretical universe where 1. you actually use Edge and 2. anyone on earth gives a shit that you circled a picture of a shoe and drew a smiley face next to it.\n\nKyle Alden, a member of the Edge development team, posted the new browser's logo on Twitter, and as The Verge notes, it looks a lot like the old Internet Explorer icon. This shrewd marketing move means that the innovative, daring, fresh, forward-looking, paradigm-shattering Edge will not disturb the routines of those who cling to the belief that \"the internet\" is wholly contained within the blue \"e\" on their computer. Microsoft knows its audience.", "WASHINGTON | Samsung regained the lead in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, as sales in emerging markets helped it overtake Apple, a research group says.\n\nIDC said Samsung sold 82.4 million smartphones in the first three months of the year, for a 24.5 per cent market share.\n\nEven though the number sold was down 7 per cent from a year ago, Samsung outpaced Apple, whose iPhone sales slipped slightly from the final quarter of 2014.\n\nApple held an 18.2 per cent market share in early 2015 after selling 61.2 million iPhones.\n\nThe figures were impacted by seasonal and other factors. Samsung notably launched its flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge phones at the end of the quarter in April, while Apple iPhone sales dipped compared with the stronger holiday quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple and Samsung were virtually tied with around 20 per cent of the market each, according to several surveys.\n\n\"The challenge made by Apple for the top spot in the fourth quarter returned to a clear lead for Samsung in the first quarter, despite the soaring global demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,\" said IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella.\n\n\"Samsung's shipments, given that the S6 was not launched into the market for the full quarter, were driven by large volumes into emerging markets and steady demand for its mid-range and lower-priced smartphones.\"\n\nChinese manufacturer Lenovo was third after completing its acquisition of Motorola from Google. Its 5.6 per cent market share placed it ahead of fellow Chinese group Huawei, with 5.0 per cent, and South Korea's LG at 4.6 per cent.\n\nIDC said the overall global smartphone market grew 16.7 per cent from a year earlier, with total shipments of 337 million units.", "April 30 (Reuters) - Forget 'wearables', and even 'hearables'. The next big thing in mobile devices: 'disappearables'.\n\nEven as the new Apple Watch piques consumer interest in wrist-worn devices, the pace of innovation and the tumbling cost, and size, of components will make wearables smaller - so small, some in the industry say, that no one will see them.\n\nWithin five years, wearables like the Watch could be overtaken by hearables - devices with tiny chips and sensors that can fit inside your ear. They, in turn, could be superseded by disappearables - technology tucked inside your clothing, or even inside your body.\n\n\"In five years, when we look back, everything we see (now) will absolutely be classified as toys, as the first very basic steps of getting this right,\" says Nikolaj Hviid, the man behind smart earbuds called the Dash.\n\nDeveloped by Munich-based Bragi GmbH, the Dash is a wireless in-ear headphone that looks like a discreet hearing aid. Packed inside is a music player, 4 gigabytes of storage, a microphone to take phone calls - just nod your head to accept - and sensors that monitor your position, heart rate and body temperature.\n\nNick Hunn, a consultant who lays claim to the term 'hearables', reckons the Dash is just the start. He predicts smartwatches will dominate wearable sales for the next three years, hearables will then overtake and, by 2020, will account for more than half of a $30 billion wearable device market.\n\nThis rapid shift is being driven, he says, by a new generation of chipsets using Bluetooth wireless communication and using far less power than their predecessors. Designers now realise \"the ear has potential beyond listening to music - it's an ideal site for measuring a variety of vital signs,\" Hunn wrote in a recent report.\n\nA parallel revolution in sensors is making this possible.\n\nKow Ping, whose Hong Kong company Well Being Digital Ltd provides algorithms and reference designs on wearable sensing to companies like Philips, Motorola, Haier and Parrot, says chipmakers have invested heavily in reducing the power consumption and size of sensors.\n\nAn accelerometer, which measures things like position, motion and orientation, for example, is now 1 square millimetre. \"A few years ago,\" he says, \"it was two or three times as big and two or three times less refined.\"\n\nWhen they can harvest energy from the body's heat or motion they'll be even smaller, autonomous and ubiquitous.\n\nAndrew Sheehy of Generator Research calculates that, for example, the heat in a human eyeball could power a 5 milliwatt transmitter - more than enough, he says, to power a connection from a smart contact lens to a smartphone or other controlling device.\n\nAnd Ping's company is working with a top Asian university to add sensors to a sports bra which could harvest energy from relative motion. In five years, he says, \"there will be people building sensors into every existing wearable device or apparel.\"\n\nBragi's Hviid calls these 'disappearables'. And while medical and fitness top the list of what these devices might measure, he and others are looking beyond that. A dozen sensors in your pants, he suggests, could advise on how to improve your posture or gait when trying to impress a suitor.\n\n\"It's more like a butler ... they do some basic stuff that you really want, but there are deeper experiences in there,\" Hviid says.\n\nSheehy points beyond the personal, as parallel advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence \"come together and lead to some remarkable use cases:\" a politician's contact lens, for example, might provide real-time feedback from a sample of voters, allowing for a speech to be tweaked on the fly.\n\nA lot of this technology is already here.\n\nGoogle is working with Novartis on a contact lens to measure glucose levels in tears. The healthcare group has also invested in Proteus Digital Health, a biotech start-up which promises edible embedded microchips, the size of a grain of sand, which are powered by stomach juices and transmit data via Bluetooth.\n\n\"We're looking at a major technological revolution of a similar magnitude to the mobile revolution,\" says Sheehy.\n\nNot everyone agrees that disappearables are necessarily just around the corner. Wearables still need to gain widespread acceptance - remember Google Glass - and the technology still needs to finessed.\n\nWhile Bragi has raised more than $3 million from crowdfunding website Kickstarter and another $10 million from angel investors, Hviid says communication problems between the left and right earbuds have delayed launch of the Dash until September. It was originally due out late last year.\n\nPing's company has been working since 2006 on wearables, and owns more than a dozen patents, but he says bringing all the technical parts together, understanding the consumer and mastering manufacturing pose a real challenge.", "Data shows U.S. economy slowed to a crawl at the start of the year By Dan Strumpf Dan Strumpf The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyDan Strumpf @DanStrumpf Dan.Strumpf@wsj.com Updated April 29, 2015 4:40 p.m. ET\n\nU.S. stocks took a hit Wednesday after data showed a sharp slowdown in the pace of U.S. economic growth in the first quarter, suggesting a deeper early-year slowdown than previously anticipated.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.61 points, or 0.4%, to 18035.53. The S&P 500 declined 7.91 points, or 0.4%, to 2106.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 31.78 points, or 0.6%, to 5023.64.\n\nStocks kicked off the session lower and held on to losses through the afternoon following a report from the Commerce Department that showed the U.S. economy grew a paltry 0.2% in the first quarter, well below expectations.\n\nThe economy grew at a much faster 2.2% pace during the last three months of 2014. Wednesday's reading is the latest indicator suggesting a marked slowdown in the U.S. economy early in the year, taking place against the backdrop of a tepid first-quarter earnings season.\n\nU.S. stocks, hit Wednesday by signs of slowing growth, held onto their losses after the Fed signaled that interest-rate increases are still possible in the coming months. Photo: Getty\n\nThe report sent the dollar sliding against other major currencies and knocked European markets sharply lower. Germany's DAX lost 3.2%, while France's CAC 40 lost 2.6% and the Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 2.2%. The euro gained 1.3% to $1.1118.\n\n\"The economic data needs to improve,\" said David Seaburg, head of sales trading at Cowen and Co. in New York. \"It's just not where it needs to be ... it's scary.\"\n\nENLARGE Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange earlier this week.

A weak first-quarter earnings season, coupled with slowing economic growth and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's timeline for interest-rate increases, have made for a rockier few months for stocks. The S&P 500 is up 1.9% so far in April.\n\nThe Fed's latest policy statement, released Wednesday, offered investors little additional clarity on its course of rate increases. The Fed attributed the recent economic slowdown to \"transitory factors,\" but offered little in the way of additional guidance. Chairwoman Janet Yellen did not give her usual news conference, and stocks held losses following the afternoon statement.\n\n\"It's a nonevent,\" said Tom Carter, managing director at brokerage firm Jones Trading, who added that the sharp selloff in European markets attracted more attention from investors. \"Europe's the bigger story.\"\n\nInvestors eye Twitter, Mastercard and GoPro stock on Wednesday morning. WJS's Kristen Scholer tells why on the News Hub. Photo: Getty\n\nTreasury bonds lost ground. U.S. bond prices had sunk before the Fed's statement and the yield on the 10-year note hit a six-week high of 2.08%, along with a broad selloff in government debt markets in Europe.\n\nHigher-yielding stocks declined alongside the selloff in bonds Utilities stocks in the S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The $27-billion Vanguard Real Estate Investment Trust Index Fund lost 2%.\n\nU.S. economic data has been weak of late, contributing to weaker quarterly results and a rockier stock market this year, said Kevin Kelly, chief investment officer at Recon Capital Partners, which manages about $200 million.\n\n\"The economic numbers certainly have been damaged, and that story that we're doing so well is not as intact,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"You can see that in the market action this year, and you can see that in the earnings.\"\n\nMr. Kelly said he remained invested in shares of large, dominant technology companies. He said he boosted his stake in Google Inc. GOOGL -0.53 % earlier this year.\n\nThe latest round of earnings reports, meanwhile, were a mixed bag Wednesday. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings among S&P 500 companies to decline 1.7%, including the 277 companies that have so far reported results, according to FactSet. If confirmed, that would mark the biggest decline in earnings since the third quarter of 2009, though it's an improvement from the expected earnings drop of 4.7% forecast in late March.\n\nHumana Inc. HUM -7.21 % shares dropped 7.2% after the company reported earnings that fell below analysts' expectations on an operating basis. Anthem Inc. posted first-quarter revenue that was lower than analyst forecasts, pushing shares down 2%.\n\nShares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. WYNN -16.64 % fell 17% after the casino operator said late Tuesday that it swung to a quarterly loss.\n\nShares of Akamai Technologies Inc. AKAM -1.24 % fell 1.2% after the cloud-computing service firm reported first-quarter results that fell short of its own forecast.\n\nStarwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide shares gained 8.3% after the company said it hired investment bank Lazard LAZ -1.12 % to explore strategic alternatives, a move that could put the company up for sale. The hotel operator also reported lower first-quarter earnings.\n\nShares of Twitter TWTR -8.94 % fell 8.9%, extending Tuesday's decline following the early release of the company's disappointing first-quarter results.\n\nOil prices jumped 2.7% to $58.58 a barrel.\n\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com", "NEW YORK (AP) -- The value of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's pay package surged last year, mostly due to gains in the Internet company's stock price that came despite concerns about the overall health of Yahoo's business.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing, Mayer's 2014 compensation increased 69 percent to $42.1 million. Her salary was unchanged at $1 million but the value of some of her stock and option awards jumped. The company said a large part of the increase came from performance-based options that were part of Mayer's recruitment package.\n\nThose awards were worth $15 million when they were approved, but Yahoo says their value has risen to about $40 million. They are counted as part of Mayer's 2014 compensation because the performance goals connected to the stock were set that year.\n\nYahoo hired Mayer away from Google Inc. in July 2012. Yahoo shares have nearly tripled in value during Mayer's tenure, mostly because of its holdings in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan rather than Yahoo's core business.\n\nThe company invested in Alibaba a decade ago and its stake is now worth close to $32 billion. But even though advertisers are shifting more of their spending to the Internet and mobile devices, Yahoo is still struggling to increase its revenue and it lags behind Google and Facebook in mobile revenue.\n\nEarlier this month, Yahoo reported its first-quarter results and pleased investors by saying it will cut costs and consider spinning off its stake in Yahoo Japan.\n\nThe Sunnyvale, California, company said in January that it will spin off its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. later this year. The move is designed to avoid a big tax bill.\n\nThe spinoff of the Alibaba stake and the potential spinoff of the Yahoo Japan holdings will increase pressure on Mayer to rejuvenate the company.\n\nYahoo's stock gained 25 percent in 2014.

It promises that the Edge browser is faster and more useful than Internet Explorer, which Microsoft has offered for the last 20 years.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,\" Microsoft executive Terry Myerson told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers.\n\nWhile Microsoft has already previewed some aspects of the new Windows, a parade of top executives is using the Build conference to demonstrate more features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs. Ultimately, they're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on operating systems from Google and Apple.\n\nDuring the three-day conference, Microsoft is also expected to show off new Windows smartphones.\n\nExperts say Microsoft needs a rich variety of apps.\n\n\"Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,\" said J.P.

Does the stress of money (or lack thereof) keep you up at night? Never really sure where all of your money goes? I've got some good news for you: you aren't alone and you aren't doomed... yet.\n\nBad money habits can lead to a lifetime of insurmountable debt. On the other hand, if you nip the problem in the bud, not only is it possible for you to get out of debt fast, but also to have more money than you've ever had. All of this is possible while maintaining the same income!\n\nBut learning how to manage your money isn't always easy because it can feel quite abstract and theoretical. That's why you need the following personal finance apps.\n\nWith real numbers in front of you, you'll quickly see how a few lifestyle tweaks can drastically flip around your money situation, eliminate all of your money leakages, and lead to a future of financial stability.\n\nExpense IQ\n\nIf you're looking for an all-in-one personal finance app, Expense IQ is one of the top contenders. Its primary function is to be an expense tracker (as implied by the name), but also includes a bill reminder feature and several features for budget planning.\n\nOn first launch, you'll be asked to set up your preferred currency and your preferred reminder frequency for inputting expenses. Unlike apps like Mint -- which we'll cover later -- Expense IQ doesn't automatically pull transactions from your banks and credit cards. You have to input transactions manually.\n\nSome people like that. Others don't. It's really up to you. But if you're diligent about it, you'll be able to see exactly where all of your money goes, which is the first step towards plugging your money leaks.\n\nThe interface is interesting, to say the least. Expense IQ employs a flat design that's reminiscent of Microsoft's Modern UI but also incorporates elements of Android's Material design. I think it looks great. Your mileage may differ.\n\nWith Expense IQ, you can manage multiple accounts (both personal and business) and you get access to interactive reports and graphs for each account. Other features include syncing through Dropbox, exporting data in CSV and QIF formats, and an integrated checkbook manager.\n\nMvelopes\n\nLet's say that you know you're an overspender. The problem is that overspending is all you know how to do. Is there an app that can help? There sure is! In fact, Mvelopes was developed for people in your exact position.\n\nThe concept of \"envelope budgeting\" is simple. Each month, you fill a handful of labeled envelopes with money (e.g. envelopes for \"Clothing\", \"Restaurants\", \"Books\", \"Steam Game Sales\", etc) and whenever you want to buy something, the money must come from the relevant envelope.\n\nIf there isn't enough money, you can't buy it. If there's leftover money at the end of the money, it rolls over to the next month. Each month, you replenish a certain amount to each envelope according to your budget.\n\nThe goal of all of this is to help you be more conscious with your spending. When you have $100 per month allotted for entertainment, it makes you second guess whether or not you really want to watch the latest movie release. Maybe that money would be better spent on new camping gear instead.\n\nMvelopes is the mobile version that makes envelope budgeting easier than it's ever been. Attention all overspenders: this app is your savior. (As long as you take it seriously.)\n\nMint\n\nI'm a huge fan of Mint. For those who don't know, Mint is an app that automatically pulls data from your banks, your loans, your credit cards, etc. and aggregates all of that information in one convenient location. I can't think of an easier way to manage money.\n\nThe automatic transaction tracking is the killer feature here. Even if you rarely spend money, the fact that you don't have to track your expenses frees up a lot of mental energy that could be more productive on other tasks. Just launch Mint once a day and you'll know where you stand.\n\nEach transaction that Mint detects is categorized, which is great because Mint also allows you to set up a monthly budget of how much you intend to spend in each category. This is a fantastic way to keep your finances in check.\n\nIf you connect your loans and credit cards, Mint will remind you when payments are due. Another helpful feature for building a better mindset is financial goals (e.g. get out of debt). Mint will track your progress and show it visually, which can help with motivation.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our overview of using Mint to save money. The mobile app is just an extension of Mint's web interface.\n\nYou Need A Budget\n\nDisclaimer: In order to use the You Need A Budget app for Android, you'll need to have a valid copy of You Need A Budget for desktop computers. It costs $60 for a license and will work on both PC and Mac. There is a 34-day free trial in case you're interested.\n\nYou Need A Budget (YNAB) is an expense tracker and budget planner in the same class as both Expense IQ and Mint mentioned above. You must enter transactions manually, but even so, it's incredibly easy and convenient to use. Seriously, you won't regret purchasing it.\n\nStart off by creating a few expense categories -- like Fuel, Restaurants, Rent, etc. -- and assigning monthly budgets to each. Adding a transaction takes just a few seconds and YNAB will automatically update all of its statistics and logs based on what you enter.\n\nThe interface is extremely clean, sleek, and minimal. No element is distracting, nothing gets in the way. Money management is all it cares about and it won't even take you a month to see just how valuable this app can be for your finances.\n\nData is synced automatically between the app and the desktop program as long as an Internet connection can be established by both.\n\nBillGuard\n\nYou're probably tired of all these apps for tracking expenses and making budgets, but here's one more. It's the last one, I promise. BillGuard was promoted as one of the best apps in 2014, so you'd do well to pay a bit of attention to this one.\n\nIn terms of transaction updates, BillGuard offers a hybrid approach. It automatically pulls data from your accounts so you don't have to input them manually, but gives you the freedom to verify each transaction before they're entered into the system.\n\nNot only does this put you in full control, but it also makes you encounter every purchase that you've made. For overspenders, the act of transaction verification can help bring to light how much you're actually spending.\n\nBillGuard also has an incredible interface that's simple yet visually intuitive. At a glance you can see how much you're spending in each category, making it easy to determine where you can cut out unnecessary spending and save more money.\n\nSo why is it called BillGuard? It will alert you on suspicious charges detected on your account. If the charge is unauthorized, you can dispute it from right inside the app.\n\nFinancial Calculators\n\nMath plays a big role in personal finance. I actually like playing with numbers so I don't mind it that much, but I know most people shudder when they have to deal with budgets, interest, taxes, etc. That's why you should install Financial Calculators.\n\nThis wonderful app comes equipped with 18+ different calculators that are designed to handle a wide variety of financial situations. For example:\n\nThe Loan Calculator takes a loan amount, interest rate, and term length to calculate how much you'll actually spend to pay off that loan. It's meant primarily for mortgage loans, but can be used for any kind of simple loan. It can also compare two different loan terms. The Compound Interest Calculator takes a principal amount, monthly deposit amount, a period length, and an annual interest rate to determine how much you'll earn through compound interest gains. The ROI Calculator takes an initial investment amount, the ending investment amount, and term length to calculate what your return-on-investment was.\n\nThis is just a small taste of what this app offers. Rather than scrambling across the web to find the proper calculator for a given situation, just install this app and it'll come in handy regardless of your situation.\n\nInvesting\n\nInvesting shows up as Stocks, Forex, Gold & Futures in the Play Store but will install as Investing, so that's what we'll call it. It's the official app created by the folks over at Investing.com, so rest assured that this app is legitimate.\n\nInvesting pulls real-time data on stocks, bonds, ETFs, commodities, forex, indices, futures, and even Bitcoin. If there's an investment market that you're interested in, Investing has you covered. That's pretty much what it boils down to.\n\nThey also provide an Economic Calendar where you can view financial events from around the world in real time, a portfolio where you can track changes for specific financial instruments, and expert advice for financial trading.\n\nNew to investments? Don't be scared! It's not as hard as you think. Get started with these YouTube channels that teach how to invest money. You'll be up and running in no time.\n\nNow You're Prepared for Success\n\nLet's take a step back and make one thing clear: an app isn't going to make you successful. Success depends on your mindset and your perseverance. However, these apps can surely help you pinpoint your shortcomings and develop the right attitude.\n\nThat's how you should use these apps. They aren't magic. They aren't shortcuts. They're tools. And like all tools in the world, they'll only be as good as the one wielding them.\n\nWant to save more money? Consider switching to an online bank. Not only do they offer better rates and features than most local banks, but online banking is just more convenient overall. Think about it.\n\nDo you use any apps to help you with your finances? I'm sure there are plenty that I missed, so please feel free to share your tips with us in the comments below.

Audiobooks are a good way to tackle your reading list, but it can be difficult to get started with them. Let's make it simple.\n\nYou might think there is nothing more to an audiobook than just downloading a title you want to listen to and get going. But several other things matter, especially to a beginner. We already instinctively know what to do with a book because of schooling, but you still need to learn tips to read more books. Similarly, it's not just \"listening\" here -- our brain needs to be trained to work with an audiobook.\n\nStart with a Book You Have Already Read\n\nYou might be tempted by the idea of starting your audiobook experience with a book that you have long meant to read but never got around to. Stop!\n\nStarting audiobooks with a new book isn't the best way. Instead, start with a book you are familiar with. If you like reading, you already have a few favourites. Pick one of the classics and start with that. In fact, you can browse through ten websites for free audiobooks and not spend a dime in your trial run.\n\nSince it's a book you have probably read multiple times, this serves as a way to get into the \"feel\" of the audiobook experience. You'll find that it's quite different from reading books, so ease yourself into this. Don't rush it.\n\nOnce you are done with your first audiobook and have familiarised yourself with listening to prose, take the next step of listening to an audiobook that you haven't already read. Maybe you'll find something cool in seven websites for unknown free audiobooks.\n\nGet the Right Narrator\n\nAn audiobook is essentially a reading of an entire book. However, unlike books where there is a single author, audiobooks often have different narrators. The narrator's style, tone and accent makes a big difference in the listening experience.\n\nPersonally, I found that listening to a British accent wasn't the best start for me. I've grown up watching American television, so an American accent felt more natural. The accent matters, so try different narrators and pick the accent that you like best.\n\nPro Tip: Try and find audiobooks read by the writer, or by a famous actor. For example, Malcolm Gladwell is a fantastic narrator and listening to him read Freakonomics is better than actually reading Freakonomics.\n\nIf you don't want to do that research, then try out something by one of the best audiobook narrators around: Jim Dale. Dale is universally liked and acclaimed for his narration of the Harry Potter series, Alice in Wonderland, and Around The World In 80 Days. The range of voices and voice-acting he comes up with in Alice In Wonderland will take your breath away.\n\nIt's very important to find a good narrator when you're getting started with audiobooks. As you listen to more of them, you'll find a few names coming up often, so you can rely on those narrators. But if you find the same book narrated by different voice actors, then download a demo of all of them and listen to a bit before deciding which narrator you want to stick with for that book. It's a little tedious at first, but the reward is a fulfilling audiobook experience -- and that's the main thing you are looking for.\n\nRemembering What You \"Read\"\n\n\"Wait, who is Andrew? Was he the guy in the bar or the guy in the police station?\" Plot points and characters can be difficult to keep track of. In a physical book, it's easy to flip back to a page. In audiobooks on phone, that can be a bit more difficult. That tiny playback bar isn't going to give you pinpoint accuracy, so you will be seeking back and forth. Of course, it's easier if you are streaming and listening to free audiobooks in your browser.\n\nTo keep track of major plot points or characters, use the bookmarking or annotation tool that you have on most audiobook apps. It takes a couple of taps, but it saves you a lot of trouble when you need to refer to something again.\n\nAs for actually memorizing what you read, there are several tricks. Like with any book, some parts stick in your memory without you having to try. With some others, you will need to make an effort.\n\nMakeUseOf Managing Editor Ryan Dube suggests using an Olympus earpiece/mic and a digital recorder.\n\n\"When something particularly striking is said, I rewind the audiobook, press record on my digital recorder that's connected to the earpiece, and press play again. It's a bit old-school, but it works.\"\n\nRyan notes that this only works if you're listening to the audiobook with external earphones, not earbuds -- or listening out loud in the car.\n\nIt is often suggested that you write down something you read in a book, if you want to remember it. So similarly, when you listen to something, try quickly writing it and sharing it on a social network. Not only can it help you remember, but you can also smartly use special hashtags so that you have a record of all these memorable writings.\n\nUse the Right Apps\n\nThere are several sites you can download audiobooks from. There are several apps for audiobooks. To be perfectly honest, there isn't a huge difference between most of these, so go with whatever you find comfortable.\n\nIf you already use a Kindle, that's ideal. Otherwise, Audible is one of the most popular apps, works with Kindle and supports WhisperSync, and has a large catalogue of audiobooks. Apart from Android and iOS, it's also a good audiobook app for Windows Phone.\n\nI prefer Audible and would recommend it to beginners because of the \"great listen guarantee\". Remember the different narrators we recommended trying? Audible lets you search by narrator, and has samples for all titles before you buy them. Plus, the service lets you exchange one audiobook for another, no questions asked, with the \"great listen guarantee\" -- that way, you can get the best narrator without spending extra.\n\nAnd importantly, you can use it to listen to audiobooks downloaded from other sources as well.\n\nRecommend an Audiobook!\n\nWhich audiobook would you recommend to a beginner? You already know my choice, Jim Dale's rendition of Alice in Wonderland.

Networking your home through a single device will enable you greater control of your local surroundings, where you can utilize a number of devices, receivers, and apps designed to make the home more efficient.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of a smart home is the energy saving technologies available. As well as saving money, you'll also be pushing toward a more sustainable, convenient living situation.\n\nLet's look at some of the best money saving devices you can bring into your smart home.\n\nThermostats - Nest Learning Thermostat\n\n\"Don't touch the thermostat!\" my father roared. I never did, until I was in my own digs. Thermostats are no longer a challenge for me and I realise how useful they can be when keeping the temperature in your house regulated.\n\nThere are numerous smart thermostat devices on the market already, but there is really only one clear winner. The Nest Learning Thermostat learns about your daily heating habits, quickly self-programming a schedule that matches your living patterns. It's a rapid learning phase, too. Within a week or so the thermostat will be picking up that on Wednesday evening at 18:30 you like the temperature at a chilly 53, or on Sunday night at 20:00 you like a balmy 78 for bath time.\n\nThe key is providing the Nest with sufficient data to learn patterns. Once the Nest has a few data points to extrapolate from it can continue managing your heating, as well as your air conditioning. As it is a data driven system, you only have to begin altering the input data to encourage the Nest to change the schedule.\n\nNest is expanding its operations by teaming up with other successful smart home devices. Check through their Works with Nest page for availability.\n\nCost: $200+\n\nOthers: ecobee Smarter Wi-Fi Thermostat, Allure EverSense WiFi Smart Thermostat, LockState WiFi Programmable 3 Stage Thermostat\n\nPower - Various\n\nOutlining a single product for smart home power management is difficult - not because there aren't any, but because you can combine so many of them for your ideal solution. So long as you wind up saving money, you can toy around with your smart home power solution.\n\nPower management is about understanding peak times and optimal times for appliance usage, and changing parts of your behavior accordingly. There a number of real-time energy monitoring tools that provide feedback on your usage vs. the cost of energy at the time of use, allowing you to make adjustments as you go.\n\nFurther to this, a good power management hub should enable you to turn appliances on and off based upon optimal power times for your locale, optimizing energy use and minimizing waste. In other words, wholeheartedly saving you cash money.\n\nExplore a combination of smart home power devices:\n\nPower timers and monitors Power strips Occupation and motion sensors Appliance switches Central management hubs\n\nCentral management hubs are extremely useful, especially if they further integrate with the wider smart home, or at least support third-party applications and appliances.\n\nLighting\n\nLighting falls under power, but needs its own little section. When you are installing your power management devices, consider upgrading your lights to some form of LED bulb. They are brilliantly bright, come in all manner of warm and cold colors, all shapes and sizes, and many of them are now available for use with dimmer switches (they used to struggle!), plus they last for a very long time.\n\nIt's a small switch that can save you serious money in the long run.\n\nSolar and Wind\n\nAnother power section. Not exclusively smart home technology, but a strategic placement of solar panels or a wind turbine can generate enough energy so you can become just a little less reliant on the grid, taking the power into your own hands. These can be quite the initial outlay, but will eventually reap a decent return in the middle-to-long run. An investment for your future, perhaps.\n\nHome Hubs\n\nControlling your smart home should be one of the most enjoyable parts of the process. In the early days of home automation, you'd have a local hub for almost every device you installed. It's much simpler now, with dedicated home hubs networking each device, communicating using the full wireless spectrum: WiFi, Bluetooth, infrared, NFC, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and many more.\n\nHomey is a colorful, spherical hub that acts as your home assistant, controlling everything and anything. Hub developers, Athom, have assured that Homey is completely voice compatible, too, meaning you can talk gently to the hub or your phone to issue commands to your smart home. This one is due to hit shelves \"around summer 2015.\"\n\nCost: $299\n\nRevolv is currently only available in the US, but it has won many supporters in the smart home sector. In fact, it's so well thought of that it is now part of the Nest Learning Thermostat Family. Combining the two devices in your smart home provides further unification of your devices and appliances, all managed through a single handy app.\n\nRevolv can control smart lights, locks, cameras, monitors, and thermostats, as well as providing active geofencing for your property, meaning you can trigger your automations as you cross the threshold to your property, or switch them off as you leave.\n\nCost: Likely to change as part of Nest Family. Was around $300.\n\nThe Wink hub is another versatile smart home hub. What sets it apart from other smart home hubs is the massive range of associated products that'll work out-of-the-box. This includes all manner of lighting, dimmers, switches, outlets, controllers, sensors, detectors, monitors, locks, gauges, window blinds, and irrigation controllers.\n\nThe hub was designed with functionality and efficiency in mind, and it certainly looks to deliver these over a wide smart home device spectrum.\n\nCost: Starting from $100\n\nGardening - GreenIQ Smart Hub\n\nSmart Homes extend to the garden, too. Installing a smart irrigation system will save you time and money, giving you scope to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\nThe GreenIQ Smart Hub can be controlled through WiFi, through a massive range of devices, and can control your watering schedule, sprinklers, and outdoor lighting through a couple of buttons. It can actively respond to changing weather conditions in your local area over a period of time, monitoring the nearest weather station and responding accordingly.\n\nUsing an intelligent hub to monitor your watering habits can help to save up to 50% on your gardening water bill, while keeping your outdoor space looking pristine.\n\nCost: $200+\n\nOthers: Rachio Iro 8 Zone Smart Irrigation Controller, IrrigationCaddy IC-W1 Irrigation Controller.\n\nRoundup\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive smart home device list, but should enable you to get your smart home up and running. You don't have to go out and splurge on all the gizmos at once - that would be somewhat costly - but I would advise setting out a clear strategy to your home smartification.\n\nYou should also check out these 6 Eco-Friendly Apps - they are an excellent step toward monitoring your carbon footprint, can be used alongside your smart home, and grant you great insight into wasteful energy habits.\n\nAssess your household energy costs.

It's hard to believe that less than a decade ago, we were witnessing the birth of industry giants such as YouTube and Facebook. A lot has happened since then, and today we're going to focus on some of the most disruptive tech breakthroughs in this time period.\n\nAs with any list of this nature, it's not all-encompassing, and will remain largely open to debate about the inclusions and snubs. Feel free to share those opinions with me in the comment section below!\n\n2005 YouTube\n\nYouTube was founded by three early employees of PayPal - Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim - in February of 2005. Just over a year later, the service was purchased by Google for $1.65 billion.\n\nDepending on which of the original co-founders you ask, YouTube either started as:\n\nA dating service that inspired to be similar to a video version of the popular website (at the time) Hot or Not, or; A sort of video directory inspired by Jawed Karim's struggles to find clips of Janet Jackson's infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" at the 2004 SuperBowl.\n\nUltimately it became (and still is) the most popular video sharing website online, and currently features 300 hours of video uploaded to the site every minute! Once you remove the annoying parts, it's actually one of the better video hosts online for both uploading and viewing.\n\n2006 Facebook Opens Its Doors to Everyone\n\nFacebook officially launched on February 4, 2004 but 2006 saw the rapidly growing social network open its doors to the public for the first time. Initially, the founders had limited the websites registrations to students of Harvard University, but later expanded to other Boston-area colleges, Ivy League Schools, and then Stanford University before allowing public registrations in 2006.\n\nMyspace was the industry giant during Facebook's initial days, but the platform ultimately removed Tom from your top 8 shortly after its public release. Since then, Facebook has achieved a meteoric rise that saw founder Mark Zuckerberg turn down at least two billion-plus dollar offers before taking the company public with a valuation of $104 billion. Facebook scams and privacy concerns aside, Facebook remains one of the most popular sites on the web with over 1.3 billion active users and (as of February 2015) a current market cap of $212 billion.\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter was created in March 2006, and officially launched in July of that same year. The website brought the term \"microblogging\" to the forefront due to its 140-character limit on text updates, called \"tweets\". Before this time, blogs were the main form of short-form opinion and dialogue between users, but Twitter turned the world on its head by offering a service that allowed people to express quick thoughts or opinions, share links, and converse freely amongst one another without the need for the cumbersome personal blog that most of us has become accustomed to.\n\nThe most disruptive element to Twitter is the speed at which it can be used to circulate information. During revolutions or periods of conflict in Greece, Moldova, Iran, Liberia, Egypt, Tunisia and others, Twitter was widely used as a platform to relay information on the ground to major media outlets, and an organizational tool for the protestors and revolutionaries.\n\nTwitter was arguably the most valuable piece of the Egyptian revolution due to media and Internet blackouts by the Mubarak regime that made organization and information sharing difficult.\n\n2007 iPhone and iOS\n\nRiding the wave of the iPod release, Apple set out to - once again - disrupt the way in which consumers used their devices. While it wasn't the first smartphone on the market, it was clearly the best of its time and to this day, each new iteration is wildly successful in terms of number of units sold.\n\nSteve Jobs led the development of the iPhone along with a team of 1,000 Apple employees who started work on the device in 2004. \"Project Purple\" as it was referred to, saw secretive collaboration between Apple (who wanted - and received - full creative control over the production and implementation) and AT&T (then Cingular Wireless). At a cost of $150 million and thirty months of development time, the iPhone was announced at Macworld 2007, and released on June 29, 2007.\n\nAmazon Kindle\n\nThe first generation Kindle released on November 19, 2007 with a retail price of $399. It sold out in less than 6 hours, and remained out of stock until April of 2008. Possibly the most historically disruptive technology on the list, the Kindle completely changed the way most of us read everything from books and magazines to newspapers and trade journals. This, in and of itself isn't an easy feat, as not much has really changed in the world of books and magazines in the last century.\n\nThe original Kindle featured a 6-inch screen and 250 MB of internal storage. The key selling point of the device was the Whispernet feature, which allowed you to download, read and store publications over a 3G connection.\n\n2008 Android\n\nAndroid had rather humble beginnings as an operating system that utilized location data and owner preferences in order to custom tailor a user experience to its owner as opposed to the one-size-fits-all approach used by industry giants Symbian and Windows Mobile. The company struggled, and was eventually acquired by Google in 2005.\n\nFast forward to 2008, and Android released the first consumer product that utilized its operating system, the HTC Dream. The goal was to open standards for mobile developers to better utilize phone hardware in hopes of further breakthroughs in the mobile space. From its humble beginnings, Android grew into the most popular operating system in the world. As of 2014, devices using the Android OS made up 77.8 percent of the global market.\n\n2009 Google Maps Turn-by-turn Navigation\n\nIn-car and personal navigation systems had been around for a few years prior, but Google revolutionized the portable GPS market when they announced their public beta release for Google Maps Navigation on October 28, 2009.\n\nWhat made the offering disruptive was the idea that instead of downloading and installing firmware updates featuring new maps, or CDs with updated navigation data, you could now do this wirelessly, over a mobile internet connection (3G at the time). In addition, this made the standalone navigation system rather redundant for smartphone users as yet another technology was swallowed by the all-encompassing smartphone.\n\nWe'll stop there for now for the sake of brevity. Be sure to keep an eye out for part two of this post where we'll discuss tech from 2010 to current, such as the iPad and Instagram. See you there!\n\nAs for this part, what'd I miss?

These fires caused more than 500 deaths, injured 1,400 people, and accounted for $1.4 billion in property damage. [Similarly,] the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported that in 2007, private sector workers suffered 1,100 electrical burn injuries and 1,480 electrical shock injuries.\n\nThese are not very healthy statistics by any standards, and from what we've seen, the figures don't look like they've improved much since.\n\nSo What Causes Damaged Chargers?\n\nWires can be damaged for a number of reasons. One of the most common causes is when you yank the cable to unplug your phone from the wall socket or the side of your laptop, rather than actually pulling the plug/connector itself. This can not only pull the plug from the wire covering, leaving exposed wires dangerously close to where your fingers go, but could even snap the grounding prong on the plug itself.\n\nSometimes, you might even trap your charging wire in a door, under the leg of your chair, or between the teeth of your dog. This can lead to 'pinching' that can result in sliced chords that expose energized wires. This not only puts you at risk of electric shocks but can also lead to short circuits, damaged gadgets, and fires.\n\nThis may not be your fault at all. Power cables may be strong, but they're not designed to last forever. Any appliance that receives regular use, whether that's your iPad or hammer drill, runs the risk of having a damaged cord and exposed wires.\n\nWhat To Do If A Power Cable Is Damaged\n\nA power cable- the chord that carries electrical power- is made up of three distinct layers. The outer layer is rubber or plastic that fits snugly around the wires. Next is the colored insulation layer which offers some protection against wear and tear to the innermost layer; the energized copper wires themselves.\n\nAs soon as you see damage starting to happen to that outer layer of a power cable, whether that's pinching, tearing (where you can see the colored wires), or freys, that's a hint that the inner layers could be damaged, too. This can lead to short circuits (which can damage your appliance) and potential fires. As soon as you see this kind of damage to a wire, temporarily patch it up with electrical tape, and try to get the power chord replaced as soon as possible.\n\nIf the damage has done harm to to the middle (and likely the energized) layers, however, you need to stop using that power-cable and replace it now. Not only is this extremely dangerous (especially if you have kids or pets around), it's also a US violation of the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70 in sections 110-2, 110-3 (a) and (b), 110-27 (a), and 250-2 (b)-(d) (Office of Complicance) to use this cable in the workplace.\n\nSome people may think this is melodramatic, but unless you're a qualified electrician, you shouldn't be relying on your own rudimentary electronic knowledge to patch up or splice a damaged power cable. The risks to yourself, your colleagues, kids, pets, home and appliances just isn't worth the few dollars it costs to replace the chord in it's entirety.\n\nWhat About Other Kinds Of Cables?\n\nIf other non power-cables are damaged, such as those on your headphones and USB cables (which carry very low voltages), then replacing the wires needn't be so urgent, though it should be on your to-do list.\n\nTo temporarily or semi-permanently repair these kind of wires (or replace them completely) with little more than a sharp blade and some electrical tape, follow a good tutorial such as the video below (to be done at your own risk).\n\nPreventing Damage to Your Cables\n\nIf you'd rather prevent your cables getting damaged in the first place, there are a few things you can do, including:\n\nAlways insert and remove the cable by holding on to the connection, not the cable itself. Once a device is charged, unplug the cable to prevent unnecessary heating of the wire which can lead to damage (extreme hot and cold temperatures damage wires). Carefully roll and store your cables neatly. Don't stuff them into bags, pockets, or boxes.\n\nAlong with this, there are two other neat tricks you should learn to keep those cables ship-shape.\n\n1. Create a DIY spring cable support\n\nWe've all had to deal with torn phone and headphone cables like this, but a little spring can go a long way to making sure that those wires last longer than usual. You can also use paracord for the same purpose.\n\n2. Learn how to properly roll a cable\n\nWho would have thought there was an art to rolling cable? Well, there is. By learning how to do this properly, you'll help to keep the cables of power tools, vacuum cleaners, and lengthy iPhone and Kindle cables etc in good working order for much longer.\n\nReplace Wisely\n\nWhen you do get around to replacing those wires you can't repair, make sure you do so wisely. There are a ton of options when it comes to durable cables, including braided nylon iphone chargers and USB cables as well as cable protectors that you could use in your shed and garage.\n\nImage credits: cable cords Via Shutterstock, Bzzzzt by Dave Herholtz (Flickr), The Vacuum Cleaner Ate My Headphones by David Blaikie (Flickr).\n\nAds by Google Check out more about: electronics", "By Tina Sieber on 29th April, 2015 | Mac OS X, Office Productivity, Windows | 2 Comments\n\nOffice 365 is a subscription based package that buys you time limited access to a number of Microsoft services and software packages, including the latest desktop Office suite, an online version of Office, cloud storage, and premium mobile apps.\n\nOffice 365 follows a business model known as Software as a Service (SaaS), which has commonly been used for deploying enterprise software. With subscription-based services like Spotify, Napster, or Amazon Prime, it has found its way into the consumer software market some time ago.\n\nDoes Office 365 provide enough value to be worth the money?\n\nCan You Still Use It on Your Desktop?\n\nYes, absolutely! Microsoft isn't moving Office entirely into the cloud just yet. While you can access Office Online via the browser and store your documents on OneDrive, Office 365 offers many other ways to access and edit your documents. The current package of Office 365 includes the Office 2013 desktop suite (Office 2011 for Mac users). In the summer or fall of this year, you will be able to upgrade to Office 2016.\n\nWhat Is Included & What Is the Price Tag?\n\nThe exact composition of the package depends on the Office flavor you choose.\n\nOffice 365 Home, Office 365 Personal, and Office 365 University include the following software:\n\nWord Excel PowerPoint OneNote (now free for everyone) Outlook Publisher Access\n\nAll Office 365 packages include 1TB of cloud storage, 60 Skype world minutes per month, and free chat or phone based tech support. With your Microsoft account, you also have access to Office Online, which can work with your files stored on OneDrive and Dropbox (see Office Online Dropbox integration).\n\nSubscriptions for Office 365 Personal start at $7 per month or $70 per year. With $10 per month or $100 per year, Office 365 Home is slightly more expensive because you can use it on up to 5 PCs or Macs, 5 tablets, and 5 phones. You can share the subscription with members of your household, slashing the price to around 20 bucks per person a year. Even if you shared the cost with one person, you pay much less than with Office 365 Personal. Each user also gets 1TB OneDrive storage free. That's a fair deal!\n\nOffice 365 University, which is available to students and other users in academia, is only available as a 4-year subscription and will cost you $80 per 4-year cycle. While you can run it on 2 PCs, Macs, or tablets, and 2 phones, you can not share this license, meaning the price is equal to a maximum shared version of Office 365 Home, minus the hassle. To me, this makes it a much better deal. Of course you'll have to prove your eligibility, but an academic email address does the trick.\n\nStudents and teachers, could get an even better deal. If your school is enrolled in the Office in education program, you could get Office 365 Education for free. The plan is similar to Office 365 Home, except that the license is free and cannot be shared. In addition, it comes with access to Yammer and SharePoint. Again, your email address will reveal whether or not you're eligible.\n\nLikewise, qualified nonprofits can also get Office 365 Nonprofit for free.\n\nAll versions of Office 365 are available on both Mac and Windows. In addition, a subscription unlocks premium features in the free mobile Office apps available for Android, iPad, and Windows Phone.\n\nDisadvantages of Office 365 & Better Alternatives\n\nOn the downside, it's a subscription model, meaning you have to pay a monthly or yearly fee. For someone who hardly ever uses Office and has no need for 1TB of OneDrive storage, this expense may not be worth it. If you don't want to spend that kind of money, you can choose from several free alternatives to Microsoft Office or you could use the free Office Online and mobile apps instead.\n\nEven with the free solutions, you'll need a Microsoft account. While this is becoming a standard for logging into Windows, it can be annoying if you have to log into Microsoft Office on your desktop before you can save a file. If you use the same accounts for Windows and Office, however, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIf you don't want to subscribe to Office 365 or deal with a Microsoft account, but need the full Office suite, you can still buy standalone Office applications or a standalone version of Office Home & Student 2013 for Windows or Mac. Whether the standalone purchases will be available for Office 2016 isn't clear, yet.\n\nAdvantages of Office 365\n\nThe key advantage of Office 365 is that it receives regular updates. In 2015, Microsoft will release Office 2016, a new suite for both Windows and Mac users. Office 365 subscribers will be able to upgrade to Office 2016 at no additional cost. If you are a power Office user who wants to be ahead of the curve and always work with the latest features, an Office 365 subscription is a must-have.\n\nBut even casual users can benefit from the subscription. 1TB of online storage for as low as $20 per year by itself is amazing. And if you frequently call people abroad, for example while traveling, an hour of free worldwide Skype calls (to 60+ countries) can come in handy, too.\n\nAs mentioned above, Office 365 grants you access to the entire Office suite -- online, on your desktop, and on your mobile devices. If you store your files in the cloud, you'll always be able to access and work with your documents, regardless of location. And should you ever have an issue with the product, free Microsoft tech support is only a chat or a phone call away.\n\nMost importantly, you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars up front for a huge software package that you don't use much in the end. Microsoft offers a free 1 month Office 365 trial, you can then pick a cheap monthly subscription plan, and cancel it anytime, in case you don't like or use it after all.\n\nDo You Subscribe to Office 365?\n\nMicrosoft is slowly changing its revenue model. Some products will become cheaper, such as free Windows 10, while others may appear to get more pricey. You can either take advantage of the added benefits and buy into the new business model, or stick with cheaper third-party alternatives. Any queries? Microsoft answers them in this FAQ page.\n\nYour turn! What perks of Office 365 do you enjoy most or why would you still prefer to buy a standalone Office suite in the future?

For a while, people thought of the idea as nothing more than a gimmick - some people still think that way - but recent product releases have shown that smart home automation is starting to live up to its promises.\n\nThere are smart devices that can reduce electricity usage, increase home security, automate home lighting, replace your doorbell, manage your garden, and even feed pets while you're away.\n\nAnd as it turns out, smart home automation is cheap when compared to the cost of other home renovation projects. While there are several easy smart home ideas for newbies, one of the best ways to get started is by purchasing a smart hub.\n\nSmartThings Hub ($99)\n\nAny discussion about smart hub eventually lands on SmartThings, so let's cover this one right from the start. The SmartThings Hub requires an Ethernet connection to operate properly, but can connect to devices using WiFi, Z-Wave, and ZigBee.\n\nWhat does it do? Basically, the SmartThings Hub is a central controller that can be configured and programmed to operate multiple devices. How does it control these devices? Through an Android or iOS app that you need to install on your smartphone. No web interface is available right now.\n\nSmartThings offers a variety of products that seamlessly integrate with the hub: Moisture Sensor (alerts when moisture is detected), Motion Sensor (alerts when motion is sensed), Open/Closed Sensor (alerts when windows or doors or drawers are opened or closed), among others.\n\nBut the best thing about SmartThings is that they are constantly expanding support for non-SmartThings products. For example, the hub can control Belkin WeMo switches. If you want an all-in-one hub, SmartThings is probably your best bet.\n\nInsteon Hub ($115)\n\nThe Insteon Hub is a great starter product for newbies who are interested in basic home automation without going to the extreme. The hub connects to all kinds of Insteon products, which can be controlled through your smartphone or your computer.\n\nDevices can be scheduled to turn on or off according to time of day. Email and push notifications are available for event triggers, such as when a device needs repairs. For deeper functionality, the Insteon Hub can be hacked (but we don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing).\n\nThe Insteon Hub has actually been around for a while. It started off on rocky ground so it has a reputation for being crappy, but their products have made big improvements over the past few years. Are they the best? Maybe, maybe not. Are they bad? Not at all.\n\nInsteon products include thermostats, wall outlets and switches, door locks, energy monitors, motion sensors, leak sensors, wireless cameras, and more. Worth checking out if you want a simple hub with a wide network of available products.\n\nVeraLite ($99)\n\nThe VeraLite is an affordable home automation system that won't confuse you with complexity. It's built using Z-Wave compatibility and can interface with hundreds of products even if they aren't Vera branded. One hub can control up to 70 devices at a time.\n\nOnce VeraLite plugs into your home network using the accompanied cable, it will automatically configure itself. In fact, VeraLite can function as an Internet router, though this functionality will disable itself if VeraLite is plugged into a router (rather than a modem).\n\nAt that point, VeraLite will connect to the Z-Wave devices in your home and you will be able to control them through your smartphone. Like Insteon, VeraLite can be set up to send text and email notifications for certain event triggers.\n\nThe Vera Store sells Z-Wave-compatible devices ranging from thermostats to energy meters, lamp modules to dimmer switches, motion sensors to door locks.\n\nopenHAB (Free)\n\nA lot of the pushback against smart home automation involves issues of privacy, security, and the proprietary nature of home automation protocols. What if you stand against all of that? Is there an option for you? Yes, there is!\n\nopenHAB is an open source home automation system that's both hardware-agnostic and protocol-agnostic. It can run on any device that's capable of running a Java Virtual Machine and can interface with all kinds of home automation technologies with more support always being added.\n\nControl over smart devices is possible through Android and iOS apps as well as a web-interface on computers. The downside - or upside, depending on how you look at it - is that openHAB is incredibly heavy on the DIY side of things.\n\nIf you like to tinker and experiment and learn through failure, you'll love it. If you're a big proponent of open source philosophy, this one's for you. If you just want a plug-and-play solution without much thought, the involvement and learning curve may be too steep.\n\nLutron Smart Bridge ($120)\n\nThe Lutron Smart Bridge, which is part of the Caseta Wireless system, is one of the less-popular hub solutions because it's nowhere near as mature or flexible as its competitors. Not that it's bad, but the limited support for connected devices is a real damper when looking to buy a hub.\n\nBut depending on your circumstances, it may still be worth buying. Lutron's forte is in the areas of lighting control, shading, and energy savings, which is why the Smart Bridge only connects to Lutron devices that control lights, shades, and temperature.\n\nEverything is controlled through a smartphone using Lutron's app. The Smart Bridge must be connected to a WiFi router using an Ethernet cable. Setup is incredibly straightforward.\n\nSo, really, the price tag is only justifiable if you really like Lutron's product line. They have some pretty cool offerings though, like dimmer switches, timers, fan controls, automated shades, and several sensor types. If energy and lighting are your main concerns, Lutron may be the way to go.\n\nStaples Connect Hub ($45)\n\nOf all the hubs on this list, Staples Connect Hub is certainly the one that'll put the smallest dent in your wallet if you don't include openHAB. At this price level, it's not even an investment -- cheap enough that there's almost no risk in trying it out.\n\nIf you don't want to buy it online, you should be able to find it in your local home improvement chain, such as Home Depot or Lowe's. Local electronics chains may carry it as well, such as Best Buy.\n\nThe Staples Connect Hub supports devices that use Z-Wave, Clear Connect, ZigBee, and WiFi protocols. This gives you great freedom in choosing smart devices that are affordable and not having to be pigeonholed into a particular brand.\n\nAll you have to do is connect the Staples Connect Hub to your WiFi router and you'll be given a walkthrough on how to set it up.\n\nAnd the Final Verdict Is...\n\nIf you want the freedom to mix-and-match different devices, go with SmartThings Hub (the most popular choice) or Staples Connect Hub (the cheapest choice). For those who support open source and don't mind the struggles of DIY, go with openHAB. If simple and straightforward is your priority, Insteon Hub won't let you down.\n\nSmart homes are just getting started. People mocked smartphones when they first debuted, and now people can't live without them. These hubs are just the beginning. Not sure which devices to start with? Try these smart home gift ideas.\n\nDo you have a smart home hub yet? If so, how has your experience been? If not, what would tip you over the edge and convince you to get one?

Unless you've rooted or jailbroken your device, the answer is probably no. Smartphone viruses are real, but app stores do a pretty good job of filtering them out.\n\nOf course, no process is perfect. Stuff has gotten through, which we'll get to.\n\nBut assuming you stick to your phone's official software store - the App Store for iOS and Google Play on Android - the odds of infection are extremely low, thanks to approval processes on both platforms. Let's talk about how these systems work, what kinds of malware have gotten through, and how you can protect yourself.\n\nHow Do The Filters Work?\n\nAs of spring 2015, both major mobile platforms review software before adding it to their app stores. For one platform, this is a recent change.\n\nGoogle's Android Market (now Google Play) was once famously open, meaning apps of all sort were put into the store without a lot of oversight. Problems like malware were caught by users - Google would take down apps when problems were reported. A software malware filter was eventually added, which scanned all submissions for known infections.\n\nSometime in late 2014 Google went even further, employing someone to look over every app.\n\nHuman reviewers (not kittens) manually review every app that goes into the store. Google's approval for apps tends to be fast - usually a couple of hours, sometimes a few days.\n\nApple's not so speedy - apps sometimes take a week to get through the App Store approval process. Human reviewers have gone through every app since the Store launched, meaning developers have to wait a long time after submitting their app before it shows up in the store. Software with malware is usually rejected (along with a lot of other apps).\n\nSay what you will about how long this process takes - and many have said plenty - but the result is that very few of the millions of apps in the App Store have ever featured malware.\n\nBoth systems mean that the software you install using the official stores on your phone were reviewed, by some combination of software malware filters and human reviewers. The odds of something nasty getting through all that is low, but not impossible: some things have gotten through on both platforms.\n\nExamples of Malware Getting Through\n\nContrary to popular belief, iPhones can get malware, mostly if they're jailbroken. But it's been proven, in theory, that malware could slip through Apple's famously strict filtering process. A research team at Georgia Tech managed to sneak some malware into an app, and Apple's process did not catch it. Being researchers, they pulled the app themselves - a courtesy actual scammers probably wouldn't bother with.\n\nActual adware has gotten through Google Play's process. Earlier this year Durak, a fairly popular card game, was found to include malware. This would stay dormant for a while - likely the reason it wasn't caught - before showing popup ads for third party app stores. (Presumably, if you installed these third party app stores, you'd end up with even more problems).\n\nGoogle has since removed Durak from Play, but it's possible similar apps could slip through in the future. If you're suspicious, follow our steps to find out if your Android device has malware.\n\nDon't Panic, But Stay Vigilant\n\nIt's worth noting that, in both these cases, the apps were eventually found and removed from their respective stores. In this way, users serve as a second approval process: discovering and reporting malware, which gives Apple and Google a chance to remove the offending apps.\n\nThis means that, if you want to avoid such malware, the following steps will go a long way:\n\nStick to software found in the official app stores: Google Play on Android and the App Store on iOS. Avoid apps with very few reviews, or that were added to the app store only recently, unless you really trust the company that makes it. Google apps you're not sure about, to find third-party reviews from sites you trust. Malware Outside App Stores\n\nWhile official app store infections are possible, they shouldn't be the main concern for mobile users. Most Android malware, for example, comes from third-party app stores (i.e., not Google Play) or pirated software from shady sites (read this before downloading cracked Android apps).\n\nBut malware doesn't have to come from apps at all. Wirelurker, for example, infects iOS devices via OS X, over USB - and it works regardless of whether your iOS device is jailbroken. To quote Palo Alto Networks, a security firm:\n\nWireLurker monitors any iOS device connected via USB with an infected OS X computer and installs downloaded third-party applications or automatically generated malicious applications onto the device, regardless of whether it is jailbroken.\n\nSo, part of keeping your mobile devices free from infection is keeping your desktop devices clean - and even Mac users need to be vigilant. Here's how to tell if your Mac has malware.\n\nDon't Panic\n\nI'm not a big fan of the walled-garden approach to application distribution, but I have to admit: malware is a pretty strong argument for this approach. But I'm sure you all have opinions, so let me know what you think in the comments below (even if it's that I'm a horrible wrong person, who is wrong).\n\nAds by Google Get the best tips from MakeUseOf in your inbox, free!

BitTorrent has teamed up with comic book publisher Dynamite Entertainment to release The Dynamite Mega Bundle: a collection of over 200 issues from 30 different titles.\n\nAmazingly, for all comic book fans who like a freebie or two, you can download the first issue of almost every title featured for free. The complete collection of all 200 issues is available as a pay-what-you-want (as long as it's more than the minimum $6).\n\nSo let's take an in-depth look at what's included in The Dynamite Mega Bundle.\n\nWhat's in the Bundle?\n\nEven if you're not a huge fan of comic books and graphic novels, there's a lot to like about The Dynamite Mega Bundle. This isn't just a collection of niche superhero comics; it's a great mix of work that has something for everyone.\n\nThree of my favourite authors -- George R.R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Jim Butcher -- have all either written a comic, or had their work adapted into one. I was delighted to see that all of them are featured in this bargain bundle.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin's Wild Cards: The Hard Call\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin's work always provokes controversy. While there are a lot of fans eagerly awaiting The Winds of Winter, his next A Song of Ice and Fire novel, Martin has plenty of other work for fans to check out.\n\nBefore Martin even started writing Game of Thrones, he created a shared superhero universe with a few other fantasy and science fiction authors.\n\nThe series is set in an alternate universe where, in 1946, an alien virus is accidentally unleashed, changing the world forever. Most people who contract the virus die a horrific death, and of the few who survive, almost all are crippled by it. However, a few fortunate people are transformed into Aces and gain superpowers. Martin edits Wild Cards issues more than he writes them, but it is still his hand that guides the series.\n\nIncluded in the bundle is a complete graphic novel, The Hard Call by Daniel Abraham, set in Martin's Wild Cards universe. This was my first taster of the Wild Cards series and I'm keen to check out more. If you're eagerly awaiting The Winds of Winter, or even just the next episode of Game of Thrones, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nThe Complete Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time\n\nThe inclusion of the complete 35-issue run of The Wheel of Time comic, adapted from Robert Jordan's series of the same name, is a huge deal.\n\nThe Wheel of Time is one of the longest continuous fiction series ever written. The 14 novels follow the Rand Al'Thor and his companions as they fight to save the world from evil. The books are famous for their vast cast of characters, intricate plots, many shades of grey and deep mythological inspiration. After Jordan died prematurely, Brandon Sanderson finished writing the final books in the series.\n\nWhile reading all 14 books is a big ask (it takes about a year), the comics cover the events of the first novel and are a great introduction to the series. Until this bundle was released, you couldn't get a single issue for less than $6. Now you can pick up the whole collection for that price.\n\nJim Butcher's Dresden War Cry\n\nI only discovered Jim Butcher's Dresden Files last year and quickly read every book published so far. Butcher's series combines hard-boiled detective fiction with vampires, faeries, wizards, and other supernatural creatures.\n\nThe protagonist, Harry Dresden, is the only wizard listed in Chicago's phonebook and serves as a consultant for the Chicago PD's Special Investigations unit, which deals with the unexplained (and unexplainable) crimes.\n\nWhile this may sound a ridiculous premise for a series of novels -- and it probably is -- Butcher manages to successfully pull it off.\n\nThe complete War Cry arc is included in the bundle. Although it's set in the middle of the series, the comic is a standalone story and, even if you have never read any of the novels, you'll almost certainly love it. If, on the other hand, you're a fan of Butcher's work but have never checked out the comics yet, do yourself a favor and pick up the bundle. You won't be disappointed.\n\nBut Wait, There's More...\n\nI've only mentioned three of the comic book series included in The Dynamite Mega Bundle. There are still another 27 for me to work my way through. You can have a look at the full list of titles on the BitTorrent Blog but there really is something for everyone.\n\nNext up for me personally is Kevin Smith's take on Green Hornet. After that, the Sherlock Holmes Trial graphic novel looks appealing. There's also a cross over between Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and Zorro that sounds both crazy and awesome.\n\nThis Whole Thing Is Awesome\n\nAlthough it is often conflated with piracy, we've argued before that there are many legal uses for torrenting. BitTorrent in particular is really trying hard to counter the bad image many people have of the practice.\n\nTheir paid bundles are a great way for publishers to provide content to fans in a way they clearly want to receive it. Even better, by offering that content at a reasonable price, BitTorrent can still make money without resorting to spammy ads and malware.\n\nAs these legal bundles become more common, I suspect that people are likely to move away from illegal downloading. I'm always keen to support artists when I can, but I will never buy physical products. These bundles strike an awesome balance.\n\nWhile they will never kill piracy completely -- the reasons people upload files are too varied -- by embracing new technology rather than running scared, publishers like Dynamite and the BBC are giving consumers what they want, and will likely be rewarded for their forward-thinking attitude.\n\nWe're sure you agree that $6 is practically nothing for a great collection of comics. So, are you going to pick up The Dynamite Mega Bundle? What are your favourite comics included within it? Please let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.\n\nImage Credits: Dynamite Entertainment\n\nAds by Google Get the best tips from MakeUseOf in your inbox, free!

American Airlines use iPads as electronic flight bags, with pilots switching from using the weighty paper-based alternative in 2013.\n\nAccording to Quartz, this was intended to prevent pilots from getting injured carrying heavy flight bags. Dumping the 35-pound bags also saves on fuel costs. Unfortunately, the switch to iPad has invited other problems, and of a potentially more serious nature too.\n\nThe iPads are used to share flight plans with the pilots, and pass other information onto the flight crew. However, what AA described as \"an issue with a software application\" meant the iPads stopped functioning correctly, leading to the flights being grounded until the problem was fixed.\n\nAs anyone who uses technology on a regular basis knows, this basically means turning it off and on again. Which somehow took American Airlines several hours to accomplish.\n\nAll Your Patents Are Belong To Google\n\nIf google had bought Tesla I wonder if they would have opened up all their patents.\n\n-- Stephen Bird (@sebirdman) April 21, 2015\n\nGoogle wants your patents. All of them. Or at least those it feels have some value. In order to find these patents and buy them from their current owners, Google has created a new Patent Purchase Promotion. Which is essentially a marketplace designed to remove any friction from the process.\n\nThe marketplace will open on May 8 and stay open until May 22. Individuals and businesses are invited to put their patents up for sale during that window, and Google will then determine which patents it wants to purchase. Google hopes to have all sales tied up by the end of August.\n\nThe big idea here is for Google to buy up valuable patents before they fall into the hands of patent trolls out to make a fast buck. As noted by TechCrunch, the added bonus for Google is that it gets to see what patents are currently available, and pick and choose those which it thinks will pay off financially over the longterm.\n\nDropbox Adds Comments To Shared Files\n\nNow available to all Dropbox users -- commenting! http://t.co/Dtr0GX9V0l pic.twitter.com/sH7WX7mcEN\n\n-- Dropbox (@Dropbox) April 28, 2015\n\nDropbox is adding a commenting option to all shared files. Formerly only available to business users, all Dropbox users on the Web can now add comments, and the feature will soon be coming to mobile too.\n\nThis all means you can have conversations with people around Dropbox files, whether they're your own or ones that have been shared with you. Mentioning someone by name or email address adds them to the conversation, and you can choose to receive email notifications when a new comment is added.\n\nStar Wars Games Touch Down on Steam\n\nSteam has added a host of new Star Wars titles to its store, with Star Wars: TIE Fighter Special Edition, Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance, Star Wars: X-Wing Special Edition, and Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter all being available to download either individually or as part of a bundle.\n\nThis is all just in time for Star Wars Day on May 4th, and in advance of the new Star Wars: Battlefront game due to arrive in November. Which itself is a precursor to the new film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you don't like Star Wars then you should consider moving somewhere off the grid for the rest of 2015.\n\nHulu Streams Every Seinfeld Episode\n\nHulu has reportedly bought the rights to stream every episode of Seinfeld on its service. The deal for rights to show all 180 episode is, depending on which source you believe, worth between $130 million (Deadline) and $180 million (Variety). Which works out to between $700,000- and $1 million-per-episode.\n\nWith Netflix having secured the rights to stream Friends in its entirety, this pitches two of the best comedies of the 1990s against each other. I personally love both, but because I'm in the UK I'll have to stick with my DVD box-sets instead. Because Netflix hates the UK, and Hulu isn't even aware of its existence.\n\nWill It Blend? - Apple Watch Edition\n\nAnd finally, we have the answer to the question currently being asked by absolutely everybody in the world. Yes, the Apple Watch WILL blend. We know, because someone, namely Tom Dickson, has blended one and captured the glorious footage for us all to see.\n\nDickson is the founder of Blendtec, and has been blending all manner of weird and wonderful objects for almost a decade now. And as if you hadn't already guessed by now, it turns out everything will blend, as long as you're using a Blendtec.

But the challenge starts now.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is a known fan of German philosophy -- in particular the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, whom he borrowed from when he said his company must have \"courage in the face of reality\" shortly after becoming chief executive of the software maker 15 months ago.\n\nNearly a year a half later, Nadella is more confident. Instead of facing down reality, Nadella's Microsoft must now have \"courage in the face of opportunity,\" he said Wednesday when speaking with analysts at the company's annual Build developer conference.\n\nAt Build, Microsoft's main mission is to convince developers and customers that its next Windows operating system, Windows 10, adds enough new features and technology to push the software into the modern era. To do that, Microsoft has transformed Windows into a service that can be layered over every device, with so-called universal apps that work across any screen and software that should, in theory, know exactly how you'll want to use it. Microsoft has also let its core products, like Office apps, move everywhere freely in an effort to build more roads back to the heart of its ecosystem.\n\nMicrosoft Build 2015 Microsoft HoloLens dazzles at Build conference, but availability still a mystery Adios Spartan. Hello, Microsoft Edge browser Microsoft aims for 1 billion devices running Windows 10 Still no word on when Windows 10 becomes available Microsoft's top task for Windows 10: Proving it's worth starting up\n\n\"Windows 10 is not just another release of Windows, but a new generation of Windows,\" Nadella said onstage. \"The tech business is about being able to know before it is conventional wisdom that that is where the market is going ... and knowing that you can get there first, get there with the best innovation.\"\n\nMicrosoft remains the world's largest software maker with Windows running on 95 percent of the world's computers. But the company missed the boat on smartphones and has, over the years, watched confidence in its platform dwindle as developers shifted focus elsewhere to Apple's iOS, Google's Android and the Web at large. PCs sales have also been on a steady decline, all while Microsoft's core productivity software has faced fierce competition from free cloud-based services.\n\nWith Windows 10, Microsoft is making a big gamble: that Windows can inject itself into every mobile device and every piece of software we use, through one operating system running apps developed for any device, all powered by Microsoft's cloud. The notion is a stark departure from what competitors Apple and Google, which have both drawn deep lines between mobile and desktop devices, have done with their respective platforms.\n\nBy 2018, Microsoft hopes to have more than 1 billion devices running Windows 10. That's ambitious, to say the least. Microsoft's previous operating system, Windows 8 runs on less than 15 percent of the world's computers and its smartphone counterpart powers only 2.8 percent of the world's smartphones. Those poor figures are the primary reason developers have lost interest with Windows, analysts say.\n\nFor Nadella, the future of Windows is a unified platform for which developers can write code that runs on a variety of gadgets, from Raspberry Pi microcomputers powering robots all the way up to game consoles and holographic headsets like the HoloLens.\n\n\"The challenge Microsoft still has is they have to get a critical mass of apps,\" said Merv Adrian, a Gartner analyst. \"They have a lot of catching up to do.\"\n\nSo far, Nadella has made a convincing argument to attract developers.\n\n\"In general, the pace [of change] has been extraordinary,\" said Adrian, who sees Microsoft as a far more open company today than in the past. \"That message sits very well with the developers,\" he said, \"who see themselves as having a much larger audience\" than just the Windows platform.\n\nWhether developers buy into that vision remains to be seen, but \"enthusiasm in the room was palpable\" during Nadella's keynote, Adrian noted.\n\n\"Developers will be the deciding factor in the ultimate success of Nadella's 'mobile-first, cloud-first' vision,\" Geoff Blaber, vice president of Americas at CCS Insight, wrote in an analyst note following Nadella's keynote Wednesday. \"Microsoft's strategy goes beyond Windows 10, but a successful launch and swift user adoption is crucial to create the foundation for Microsoft's business model transition.\"\n\nAt Build, Microsoft outlined how developers can beef up the Windows Phone platform by announcing tools to re-use Android and iOS code more easily. Now, instead of developing for each platform separately, app creators can convert software into the native languages of Apple and Google's platforms.\n\nIt's a bold move, but not without its complications; developers may never make apps specifically with Windows in mind if they can simply move the software over after-the-fact. \"The decision to embrace Android and iOS applications is an imperfect solution to an undesirable problem,\" Blaber noted. \"Nonetheless, it's a necessary move to attract developers otherwise lost to Apple and Google.\"\n\nMicrosoft has also developed a modern Web browser, now officially called Edge, to which it has plugged in its most ambitious new features, like the Cortana data assistant that's powered through its Bing search engine. With Office 365, the company's flagship software now sold as an annual subscription service, Microsoft is creating a system for developers to plug in other apps and services. That may help key products like Word, Excel and PowerPoint become invaluable to how businesses do work rather than more costly alternatives to free software from Google and others.\n\nWith Windows 10 on the horizon, Microsoft's ambitions will be put to the test. The company is believed to have missed the ball on mobile and arrived late to the party with the cloud. Both represent two critical computing revolutions that are still defining how we work, play, entertain and create and have spelled the end for a number of once-powerful technology companies that failed to keep up.\n\nBut perhaps it's yet another Nietzsche quote from which Nadella can draw wisdom for the future: \"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.\"", "Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp., speaks during a keynote session at the Microsoft Developers Build Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.\n\nThe word of the day for Microsoft is: platform. On Wednesday, CEO Satya Nadella and his lieutenants ran through a nearly three-hour keynote presentation to kick off the company's annual Build developer conference in San Francisco, and no word came from executive lips more often than \"platform.\"\n\nNadella called Microsoft a platform company. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's executive vice president of operating systems, only referred to Windows 10 as a platform. Microsoft Azure, a cloud service to build and deploy apps on? Yes, it's also a platform. HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality headset, which runs Windows 10, was even positioned as a platform that'll define the future of how we interact with computers -- taking on both wearables and virtual reality at once.\n\nThe reason Microsoft's platform push is important to you -- whether you're an investor, developer or consumer -- is because it reflects how the company views itself, and where it's moving in order to attract customers beyond the core Windows business users and devotees. Microsoft has had a string of flops with Windows Phone 7, 8 and 8.1; and Windows 8 and 8.1. By ignoring Web standards adopted by Google's Chrome Web browser, Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox, Microsoft's Internet Explorer grew largely irrelevant. And while Apple's Mac sales continue to grow, the Windows PC market remains in an overall downward slope.\n\nOne Windows, Everywhere\n\nCentral to Windows Phone and Windows 8 is the idea that your phone, tablet and PC should run software that looks and behaves the same. Windows 10's major theme is much the same: that it's one operating system that's able to run the same apps across all these different devices -- a sermon Nadella and those in Redmond hope will win over consumers, developers and investors alike.\n\nMicrosoft's idea of one continuous platform runs contrary to the vision of both Apple (with OS X, iOS and now a Watch OS) and Google (with Chrome OS, Android and its wearable platform, Android Wear). Microsoft showed off almost no new features for Windows 10 during the keynote, and execs didn't say when it would arrive on new devices. (A Microsoft spokesman said the company is sticking to the \"summer\" timeframe it first threw out back in January.) But they did show Windows 10 running on phones, PCs and the HoloLens augmented reality headset.\n\nContinuum: Your Phone Can Be a PC\n\nA new feature will allow Windows 10 phone owners to plug their devices into a PC display, using the phone as though it were an actual desktop computer.\n\nIn his demo, Joe Belfiore, a corporate vice president in the operating systems group, plugged a phone into a monitor and controlled what was on screen with a keyboard and mouse. He checked some email and edited a PowerPoint presentation and PowerPoint didn't look like a dumbed-down phone version, but the full-blown PC variant.\n\nContinuum, as it's called, will eventually be a part of Windows 10, but it's all still very much in development. When it does become a reality, it will require special hardware, such as compatible phones and/or monitors.\n\n1 Billion Devices in 3 Years\n\nMyerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, said that more than 1 billion new and existing phones, tablets and PCs will be able to run Windows 10 and that over the next two to three years, the company wants to get the people who use those machines to convert over to Windows 10.\n\nThe goal is hugely ambitious, especially since Windows 8 sales never came close to reaching that number. In February 2014, the last time Microsoft publicly shared its Windows sales numbers, the company said it had sold more than 200 million licenses. Windows 7 sold more than 240 million.\n\nAndroid and iOS Apps on Windows -- Maybe\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of news coming from Build today was that Microsoft has built Windows 10 to allow developers to easily port over apps built for Android and iOS. If developers take the time to bring their apps over to Windows 10 smartphones (Microsoft isn't calling them Windows Phones anymore), this could mean a long-overdue boom in Windows smartphone apps. But whether or not developers take pains to do this remains to be seen.\n\nWhile the news might be encouraging for Windows Phone users who are bummed they're missing out on the latest apps found on other handsets, this is likely to have little impact on Windows tablets or laptops. After all, when was the last time you ran a phone app on your desktop, outside of Angry Birds?\n\nEdging Out Internet Explorer\n\nIn January, Microsoft showed off Project Spartan, a new Web browser that's built to run on phones, tablets and PCs. Well, Project Spartan has a new name: Microsoft Edge. How much Edge has in common with Internet Explorer remains to be seen. But, Microsoft is adamant that Edge is built for the modern Web -- desktop and mobile. Belfiore demoed Edge, showing off Cortana for voice searches, as well as its built-in note taking and annotation features. Will Edge be able to help Microsoft gain the ground Internet Explorer lost?\n\nHoloLens: Apps Wanted\n\nMicrosoft demoed apps for its HoloLens augmented-reality headset for the first time today. The demo was partially to show off how potentially cool HoloLens could be, and to prod developers into making \"universal Windows apps\" that run on phones, tablets, PCs and HoloLens, too. Microsoft said that NASA, Disney, AutoDesk and video game developer Unity are all working on HoloLens apps right now. And it gave a demo of an app that dissected a human body for medical students studying anatomy. The app, which is being tested by students and professors at Case Western Reserve University, allowed HoloLens wearers to see bodies and body parts in a life-sized scale or blown up to see otherwise minute details.\n\nJust as it did in January, HoloLens wowed us and left us with the impression that while Windows 10's success isn't guaranteed, and Windows phones are still languishing, Microsoft does have some cutting-edge ideas in the works. Microsoft brought hundreds of HoloLens headsets to Build for developers and press to try out (we haven't gotten a demo yet), and says the headset should go on sale later this year. When and how much? Well, Microsoft isn't saying just yet.", "Seventy new Now cards in the Google app provide even more information to Android users before they've had a chance to ask for it, according to a blog post from Google.\n\nThe search powerhouse introduced Google Now cards back in February, as a way for users to keep up with information from 40 different apps, including Pandora, eBay, and Airbnb. For example, when you turn your mobile Internet back on after a flight, a card from Lyft may remind you to order a car, while one from Instacart, which keeps track of frequently ordered items, may let you know that it's time to stock up on those items.\n\nSome newly available apps include Spotify, OpenTable, Jawbone, ABC News, RunKeeper, YouTube, and Zipcar. Additionally, Now cards can remind users of local traffic, events, and public transit arrival times.\n\nThe number of Now cards partners is now 110, with a third wave of apps to be added in the near future. The feature is still only available in Google's Android app.", "SAN FRANCISCO, April 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung, control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones. It said on Wednesday it is aiming for one billion devices running Windows 10 in two to three years time.\n\nIts new browser will arrive as Microsoft Edge, replacing the waning Internet Explorer, when Windows 10 is released, the company said. (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Microsoft hopes to get more people using the next version of its Windows software on all kinds of devices, by giving them access to many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones.\n\nIn a major strategy shift, a top executive told an audience of several thousand software developers Wednesday that Microsoft will release new tools to help them quickly adapt the apps they've built for Apple or Android gadgets, so they will work on smartphones, PCs and other devices that use the new Windows 10 operating system coming later this year.\n\nOn the first day of the company's annual software conference, other executives showed off more uses for Microsoft's holographic \"augmented reality\" headset, the HoloLens -- although it's not yet for sale. They also announced the official name for a new web browser, called \"Edge,\" that they promised will be faster and more useful than the Internet Explorer that's been a Microsoft mainstay for 20 years.\n\nAll those initiatives are tied to the impending release of Windows 10, the centerpiece of Microsoft's ambitions to regain the stature it commanded when Windows-based PCs dominated the computing world. Today, after losing ground to smartphones and tablets that run software from rivals Apple and Google, Microsoft wants to make Windows 10 the universal software for PCs, phones and other Internet-connected gadgets.\n\n\"Windows 10 represents a new generation of Windows, built for an era of more personal computing,\" CEO Satya Nadella said during a keynote speech, adding that today's consumers and corporate workers want to have the same experience when they are using a variety of devices.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has previously shown off some features of Windows 10, it's hoping to enlist an army of software developers as allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm for the new release. The company is using the three-day conference, called Build, to demonstrate more features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs.\n\n\"Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,\" vice president Terry Myerson said.\n\nTo win over consumers who use competing software, Microsoft needs to persuade outside developers, who create software for consumers and corporate clients, it's worth their time to create new apps and programs for Windows 10.\n\n\"Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,\" said J.P. Gownder, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. He said Microsoft has struggled with a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem, in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for Windows because relatively few people use Windows phones and tablets.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 1.4 million apps for Android phones and about the same for Apple devices, while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on Windows phones and tablets.\n\nMicrosoft's move to help developers adapt their Apple and Android apps for Windows 10 is a major change from the past, when each company maintained rigid differences in their software platforms. Microsoft is also hoping to entice developers by promising that apps for Windows 10 will work equally well on PCs, mobile gadgets, Xbox game consoles and even the HoloLens.\n\nThe company has another big carrot to wave in front of those developers: Microsoft has already said it will release Windows 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have PCs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of Windows, provided they upgrade in the coming year. That could help create a huge new audience of Windows 10 users in a relatively short time, Gownder said.\n\nMyerson predicted there will be a billion devices using Windows 10 within the next two to three years. Apps for all those devices will be distributed through a single Windows app store. Myerson also said Microsoft will partner with wireless carriers so consumers who lack credit cards can pay for apps on their phone bill -- a popular method in developing nations.\n\nMicrosoft has not said exactly when Windows 10 is coming, although some were hoping the company would announce a date on Wednesday.\n\nSince he became CEO last year, Nadella has been presiding over a major overhaul at Microsoft. He has redesigned some of Microsoft's most popular programs for mobile users and invested in new \"cloud-computing\" services, in which businesses pay to use software that's housed in Microsoft's data centers.\n\nMicrosoft announced several new initiatives Wednesday for its Azure cloud-computing service, which has emerged as a fast-growing rival to a popular cloud business operated by Amazon. Microsoft is releasing new programming tools for Azure clients to create programs for computers that run Apple and Linux software, as well as those that run Windows.", "As entrepreneurs, we rely on innovation to capture market share. In today's digital economy, it's the innovative application of technology that provides our best opportunity to differentiate.\n\nUber has clearly differentiated itself through an exceptional software experience, disrupting an entire industry in the process and spawning a steady stream of imitators. Hardly a day goes by without hearing another set of startups billing themselves as \"the Uber of_____ (fill in the blank).\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUSAA clearly differentiated itself as a preeminent bank when it introduced the first of its kind \"Deposit@Mobile,\" allowing consumers to deposit checks virtually. Zillow and Redfin are changing the face of real estate by providing data formerly available only to realtors directly to consumers. Software products rule the roost when it comes to most of the hottest companies around.\n\nIt would make sense, then, to assume that a robust technical application and exceptional user experience would be the key driver of entrepreneurial -- and product -- success.\n\nApparently not.\n\nLate last year, a research study, conducted by the University of Maryland's Center for Excellence in Service at the Robert H. Smith School of Business and 3Pillar Global, established the industry's first index for product development success. The study identified six critical components to successful product development, with culture as the most influential. The research revealed that employees must truly believe that their contributions to their organizations are valued and feel as though they have room to grow.\n\nThe research resulted in the \" Product Development Success Index,\" providing a benchmark for software product development readiness. The findings clearly show that culture, feedback, communication, staffing, collaboration and time/budget focus drive product development success more than any other factors -- including technical expertise.\n\nIf culture eats strategy for breakfast, as the great Peter Drucker once said, it apparently eats technology for lunch. An organization's focus on allowing people the flexibility to take risks, be creative, challenge the status quo and be innovative -- what we refer to as \"culture\" -- is the leading factor that determines product success.\n\nOrganizations seeking to optimize their product development process should focus on creating a culture that fosters innovative thinking and strategy. According to the research, an innovative culture is defined by the following characteristics.\n\n1. It makes known that every employee's contributions are valued\n\nLeading organizations make it very clear that everyone's contributions are valued. Individuals throughout the organization are treated with respect, and ideas are respected regardless of where in the organization they germinate. Within high performing organizations, there is a spirit of appreciation and a commitment to celebrating success. Leaders in these organizations are the team's biggest cheerleaders.\n\n2. The organization provides an opportunity for all team members to grow\n\nHighly innovative organizations provide an opportunity for individuals to learn and grow. Google's 80/20 rule is one well-known example of a company providing on-the-job freedom to work on something outside their normal day-to-day responsibilities. Atlassian, which makes the popular JIRA suite of products for project management, holds \"FedEx Days\" once a quarter, where employees get 24 hours to build and ship any product they'd like as long as it's tied to an Atlassian product. Team members at the most successful companies regularly participate in new projects, take on new responsibilities and try their hand at new skills.\n\n3. It embraces the idea of continuous improvement\n\nInnovative teams are not afraid to take smart, calculated risks. They embrace the idea that perfect is the enemy of good, or that something can always be better. They release products early and often and embrace customer feedback to refine, reiterate and improve. High performance organizations are continually improving their products and their processes. They learn from mistakes and refine their performance over time.\n\n4. It provides the flexibility to be creative\n\nHigh-performance cultures provide the flexibility to think differently. They encourage out-of-the-box solutions and empower individuals to test new -- even obscure -- ideas. They foster creative thinking. Innovative teams respect the power of the individual and provide teams the opportunity to create new, differentiated approaches.\n\n5. It embraces cross-departmental collaboration\n\nThe best product development organizations tear down silos. They work collaboratively across the organization, communicating and, more importantly, engaging, through both informal and formal channels. Individuals and teams are fully engaged.\n\nWithin the most innovative organizations, cross-departmental collaboration is standard practice and part of every day life. Cross-functional engagement is highly valued. Technologists work closely with marketing. Marketers work closely with product management. Communication is constant and established as the status quo.\n\n6. Culture, not technology, is the driving factor behind innovative companies and products.\n\nSoftware products are disrupting industries because strong cultures are challenging the corporate status quo. As the Product Development Success Index clearly demonstrates, it is the soft skills, not the technical capabilities, which organizations need to develop if they want to become leaders in their industries and proficient at developing successful software products.", "Completely deleting something from the internet is like corralling drunk, feral geese after setting them loose: Damn near impossible. But there are ways to conceal the web content you don't want anyone to lay eyes on. You can hide all sorts of webpages with what's essentially a \"Keep Out\" sign for search engines: a special file called robots.txt.\n\nThe robots.txt file acts as shortcut to bury content so deep it's hard to dig up. As BuzzFeed recently illustrated when it tried to hide deleted posts that were critical of properties of its advertisers, robots.txt is a fairly potent coverup tool. If you want to dodge responsibility for something you've published, the file will partially hide your tracks. The internet's memory is long, and robots.txt is a forgetting protocol.\n\nBuzzFeed used robots.txt to make it harder for people to find a few posts about Dove and Monopoly that it had deleted in a bout of editorial stupidity. By adding the URLs of these ghost posts to its robots.txt directory, it prevented older versions from showing up in online searches. This didn't mean the posts were gone entirely. People can always go digging through your robots.txt file to see what you've hidden, so it's not effective for completely killing your post. But it made it so that Unilever execs pissed about the deleted Dove commentary would not be able to find it unless they specifically rummaged through BuzzFeed's robots.txt directory.\n\nSo how does it work? Search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo often cache older versions of webpages, meaning it's fairly simple to find a copy of a deleted post. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine also archives copies of gone posts, preserving a digital record. In general, this habit of preservation is a boon for protecting digital history. But when you want something to be forgotten, this tendency towards record-keeping becomes a problem.\n\nHowever, Google, Bing, Yahoo, the Wayback Machine, and a variety of other search robots will listen to your commands not to keep a record. Most of the robots used by search engines will look for the presence of a robots.txt file right away, and will obey instructions to exclude content.\n\nFor a professional media company to self-censor is shady as hell, but perhaps you, dear reader, have a better reason. Making a robots.txt file to hide your shameful exploits is very easy. You open up a text editor and type the following:\n\nThen you customize it with exactly what you want to disallow, and save it as a .txt file. It's important to use lowercase for \"robots\" and to make a separate \"Disallow:\" command for each exclusion.\n\nFor the Wayback Machine, for instance, you write this and it'll retroactively scrub your page:\n\nUser-agent: ia_archiver\n\nDisallow: /\n\nAfter that, you upload the file to the root directory of your domain (it has to be the main one). If you don't have direct access to the directory, contact your web admin. You can also set up commands that just hide one specific posting, or commands that stop multiple crawlers from searching.\n\nThis isn't just useful for hiding embarrassing adventures in blogging -- it's also helpful for hiding password-protected pages and sensitive information. E-commerce services can use robots.txt to keep databases that contain clients' personal data hidden away.\n\nSome sites get creative with their robots.txt files -- Yelp includes instructions on the off chance that the robots become sentient as an inside joke. And may web admins include directions in robots.txt to help their sites get crawled more quickly, so it's as much a tool for guiding robots around as it is a tool for telling them to stay out.\n\nMost of the time, people try to get their internet content discovered. But robots.txt, which has been around since 1994, highlights a persistent desire for a level of control over how what we put on the web gets spread around. When media companies backtrack on what they've published, it draws attention to how this tool can be used for coverups. Yet there are many reasons why people want the chance to limit audiences, and the existence of a tool to give makers more power over what gets discovered and remembered online is a good thing.", "It's impossible to ensure that only good guys will be able to access them, lawmakers say\n\nU.S. lawmakers are skeptical of an FBI request for Congress to mandate encryption workarounds in smartphones, with critics saying Wednesday that back doors would create new vulnerabilities that bad guys can exploit.\n\nIt's currently impossible for smartphone makers to build in back doors that allow law enforcement agencies access to encrypted communications but also keep out cybercriminals, witnesses and lawmakers said during a hearing before the IT subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nLaw enforcement representatives called on lawmakers to find a way to allow access to encrypted data as a way to prevent serious crime. Late last year, FBI Director James Comey called for a public debate on encryption after Apple and Google announced they would offer new encryption tools on their smartphone OSes.\n\nBut most lawmakers questioned the need for encryption workarounds. Building in back doors for encryption on smartphones would be \"technologically stupid,\" said Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat with a background in computer science. Apple and Google have responded to public demand for encryption because of an \"out-of-control surveillance state,\" he added.\n\nWith all kinds of unencrypted digital information and tracking technologies available to law enforcement agencies, police are living in a \"golden age of surveillance,\" added Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and committee chairman. \"We're certainly not going to go dark, and in some ways, we've never been brighter.\"\n\nCongress needs to find the right balance between privacy and national security, but building back doors in encryption would be similar to \"drilling a hole in a windshield,\" Chaffetz said. If Apple can figure out how to circumvent smartphone users' encryption, \"so can the nefarious folks in a van down by the river,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI doesn't need to hold the keys to encrypted information on smartphones, but policymakers and the technology industry need to figure out a way to allow law enforcement access to criminals' devices when a judge issues a warrant, said Amy Hess, executive assistant director at the FBI's Science and Technology Branch. Tech companies should implement encryption workarounds in the product \"design phase,\" she said.\n\nWhen criminals are storing information on encrypted devices, the process of obtaining search warrants may be \"an exercise in futility,\" Hess said. The FBI believes that \"no one in this country should be beyond the law,\" she added. \"The notion that a suspected criminal's closet could never be opened, or his phone could never be unlocked, even with properly obtained legal authority, is troubling.\"\n\nPolice have used information on smartphones to investigate many crimes, including child pornography and human trafficking, added Daniel Conley, district attorney in Boston. He called on Congress to require smartphone makers to allow law enforcement access to encrypted data and on technology companies to come up with new ways to allow law enforcement access to data.\n\nPolice agencies need access to digital information to solve crimes, and they don't otherwise track people, he added. \"We don't monitor websites where people visit or aggregate data about people's personal health, wealth or shopping habits,\" Conley said. \"That, frankly, is the purview of companies like Apple and Google.\"\n\nConley had harsh words for data collection by technology companies. \"Their nominal commitment to privacy rights would be far more credible if they were forbidding themselves access to their customers' interests, search terms and consumer habits, but as we all know, they're taking full advantage of their customers' private data for commercial purposes,\" he added.\n\nOther witnesses at the hearing said encryption workarounds would cause serious problems for technology vendors. U.S. smartphone apps that allow back doors would likely be banned in many European countries, said Jon Potter, president of the Application Developers Alliance. In addition, if the U.S. demands encryption back doors, other countries will follow suit, he said.\n\n\"Nearly every digital business wants to be global,\" he said. \"But mandatory government back doors may spark a trade war and imprison businesses in their home country.\"\n\nGrant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for The IDG News Service.

So does this mean the PC is making a comeback?\n\nEver since Steve Jobs walked onto the stage of the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts on Jan 27, 2010 and introduced the first iPad to the world, analysts have been talking about the death of the PC.\n\nAnd while the tablet's popularity exploded at a rate never before experienced in the history of consumer electronics - Gartner claims 229 million were sold in 2014 alone - sales are not only cooling, it looks as if the computer might actually be making a comeback.\n\nIn amongst the numbers regarding huge iPhone sales and information about being swamped with demand for its first smartwatch, Apple's latest quarterly earning figures show that its computer sales are also up - considerably.\n\nApple sold 4.6 million Macs over the last three months - a 10% year-on-year increase - and those figures only run to the end of March, meaning that they don't include sales of its latest notebooks, which didn't go on sale until April 10.\n\nThe company sold 12.3 million iPads over the same period but, for the first time since 2011, Apple has made more in revenues from its PCs than from its tablets.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple doesn't differentiate between notebook and desktop sales when presenting its figures, but the signs suggest its portable PCs are seeing a boost in popularity.\n\nAccording to Digitimes' Asian supply chain sources, notebook shipments are expected to grow 11% over the next quarter and this upturn is being driven by demand for MacBooks and Google's Chromebooks.\n\nThe publication's own research, published ahead of Apple's figures, correctly forecast higher Mac sales and even Gartner, whose latest report into the state of the PC industry - published on April 9 - is positive about notebooks, convertibles and hybrid computers, despite painting a grim picture for the immediate future of the desktop.\n\n\"PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality. Our early study suggests strong growth of hybrid notebooks, especially in mature markets, in 1Q15,\" said Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner.\n\nAs well as the re-emergence of the notebook, 2015 could still also be the year that the tablet gets a new lease on life.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple is developing a larger, productivity-focused tablet - that the press has dubbed the iPad Pro - which is expected to boast a 12in display and offer computing power on a par with an ultrabook PC.\n\nHowever, when the company chooses to release it is anyone's guess. - AFP Relaxnews", "The Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality headset is demonstrated on stage during the 2015 Microsoft Build Conference on Wednesday at Moscone Center in San Francisco, California.\n\nSilicon Valley developers gathered for a conference on Wednesday.

For those keeping score, there is no Windows 9, perhaps to avoid any association with Windows 8, which, as Wood put it, \"bombed.\"\n\nWindows 10 will run across Microsoft devices: desktop computers, laptops, the Windows phone, tablets -- even the XBox.\n\nThe conference was intended to stoke excitement among developers to build apps using Windows 10, even though sales of Windows phones have largely been disappointing. The prom king moment was brought to you by Nadella, who took over from longtime CEO Steve Ballmer in 2014.\n\n\"Microsoft, for a long time, has had this problem where it was very divided,\" Wood says. \"So even though they've been promising a unified Windows experience for at least a decade, it seems like Satya Nadella is actually breaking down the walls.\"\n\nBeyond Windows, the most excitement today came from a new augmented reality headset the company is calling HoloLens -- \"Microsoft's sort of new, cool attempt to be future-sexy,\" Wood called it. \"Augmented reality headsets are almost like the next step after virtual reality because they project images onto the real world.\"\n\nOne demonstration of HoloLens showed medical students examining holograms of cadavers, looking at broken bones and beating hearts.\n\nDespite Microsoft's reputation as being generally lackluster compared with shiny consumer offerings from Apple and Google, it's still wildly profitable. It's worth $400 billion and has annual revenue of $93 billion.\n\n\"We should all be 'failing' like the rumors of Microsoft failing,\" Wood says.\n\nThe real strength of its business, what Nadella spent 90 minutes discussing at Build 2015, is Microsoft's cloud offerings.\n\n\"Most of that [revenue], is on those cloud services that Amazon just announced it makes so much money on,\" she says. \"And so, even if Windows 10 and Windows Phone don't totally take off, they're still going to be okay.\"", "Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, just pulled down a 69% raise, bringing her total compensation for 2014 to $42 million and making her the best paid female executive in the Standard & Poor's 500.\n\nThe 39-year-old former Google executive was paid $1 million in salary - but that's just the start.

The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment.

The BBC's new Broadcasting House, for example, encourages hot desking, with 460 workstations in its open-plan newsroom alone.\n\nBut this brave new world of work has critics.\n\nFor some, open plan spaces suggest managers on the room's sidelines, watching workers huddled in the middle like prey on the African savannah.\n\nSeattle architecture firm NBBJ is behind the Google and Amazon buildings, as well as the new Guangdong headquarters for Chinese internet titan Tencent.\n\nOffices are moving away from the idea that time at a desk is a measure of how productive you are, says Ryan Mullenix, an NBBJ design partner, and the chief designer of the new Google building.\n\nAnd more broadly, away from ideals of industrial efficiency associated with early twentieth-century American mechanical engineer Franklin Taylor.\n\nSometimes a longer walk to get coffee may be better than a shorter one.\n\n\"It's who you see on the way to coffee, and movement which charges your brain, which is really valuable and part of work,\" says Mr Mullenix.\n\nThe social side of work may soon be the only reason we have office buildings, says Scott Wyatt, NBBJ's chairman.\n\n\"Getting together with people in teams is where innovation happens, and makes us happy,\" he says. \"You're not going to be happy holed up at home doing all your work.\"\n\n\"The company which gives the employees the choice at any given moment to optimise their effectiveness is going to win,\" says Mr Wyatt.\n\nAnd a recent all-night hackathon, where ideas are developed, sponsored by NBBJ produced an app to let employees find available working spaces nearby, arranged by variables such as light, ambient noise, and the number of people around.\n\nCrucial in all this is the new mobility which stems from more portable devices and cloud computing.\n\n\"If you sit at your desk for more than twenty minutes, you start getting stupider,\" says the chairman.\n\nHis architecture firm posts maps next to lift doors, suggesting outdoor walking routes for meetings of various lengths.\n\nTechnology, media, and telecommunications firms set trends in the future design of the office, because they are the first sectors with members of Generation X - those born from the early sixties to the early eighties - in the boardroom, says architect Nicola Gillen.\n\nShe specialises in performance and the built environment at the firm AECOM.\n\nShe says many of the newest ideas about the office trace their origin to British architect Dr Frank Duffy CBE, who in the 1960s brought Northern European ideas of flexible office landscaping (or B\u00fcrolandschaft) into the English-speaking world.\n\nInfluenced by Scandinavian egalitarianism, these theories encouraged different levels of staff to work together in non-hierarchical environments in an open floor.\n\nThey appealed to many in postwar Europe. They also seem to appeal to the youngest graduates of today.\n\nMillennials \"are used to different ways of working, sharing, and collaborating, even from an early age,\" says Elaine Rossall, head of London market research for property consultants Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nShe thinks there has been a retreat from the last decade's enthusiasm for working from home, and points to growing so-called \"worktivity\" amenities, from running tracks to social, play, and eating areas, \"to kind of keep people in the building\".\n\nThe youngest workers also are digital natives, who come into the workplace expecting to have the latest type of tech, says Paul Phillips, head of consultancy services at the workplace consultancy Assurity Consulting, based in West Sussex.\n\nHe thinks wearable technology will soon lead to new ways of presenting information about a building to its users.\n\nAnd increasingly globalised businesses and markets will spur new development in telepresence and teleconferencing, to cut costs and help the environment, he says.\n\nWith acute skill shortages in certain areas of the tech sector, to attract and retain young graduates it is increasingly important for employers to adapt to their habits, Mrs Rossall says.\n\nAnd also to where they are.\n\nMillennials have gravitated to grittier urban areas with lower housing costs, like East London.\n\nThis in turn opens up new areas of London to employers, who can draw their workforce from a different catchment.\n\nCompanies like Amazon, with its Seattle office, are moving away from suburban business parks, and back into cities.\n\n\"It's where their young and hip employees want to live, of course, but walkable urban campuses are also much more environmentally sustainable than suburban office parks,\" says Seattle-based Scott Bonjukian, who writes a blog called the Northwest Urbanist.\n\nAt the same time, he is worried this move will lead to rapidly rising rents, and lessen the very diversity of our neighbourhoods, places, and people which makes urban environments attractive.\n\nAnother challenge for designers of the future office is catering for workers from four generations, Millennials, Generations X and Y, and Baby Boomers in senior management.\n\nOpen-plan offices can be cheaper for companies to set up, by up to 20%, according to Dr Vinesh Oommen, at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nBut despite the efforts of some architects, they can easily be done badly.\n\n90% of studies found open-plan offices were associated with higher levels of stress and elevated blood pressure, Dr Oommen found.\n\nAnd older generations might particularly relish having a room of their own.\n\nMr Mullenix says whether the open office is good or bad is \"probably the wrong question\".\n\nIt is the ability to create different areas within a campus and building, catering for different working styles that is important, he says.\n\nArchitectural and design innovations quickly radiate from buildings like Google's to shape the office of the future.\n\nAnd tellingly, the tech sector has made Office a byword for software as much as bricks-and-mortar hardware.\n\nSo don't be surprised if in the future you soon find yourself working in a wifi biosphere, a deathstar, or a bean-bag.", "Clean-water advocate takes Earth Day swim in New York's Gowanus Canal, a Superfund siteMore >>\n\nJapan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe started a three-day visit to California on Thursday with plans to check out tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the governor.\n\nDuring a speech at Stanford, Abe said Japan needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years.\n\nHe compared the effort to Japan sending baseball players to major league baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe said he plans to meet with Google and Facebook executives and visit electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nLater in the day, the Japanese leader will head to San Francisco and invite Gov.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "The present four-year California drought is not novel -- even if President Barack Obama and California governor Jerry Brown have blamed it on man-made climate change.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, California droughts are both age-old and common. Predictable California dry spells -- like those of 1929-34, 1976-77, and 1987-92 -- are more likely result from poorly understood but temporary changes in atmospheric pressures and ocean temperatures.\n\nWhat is new is that the state has never had 40 million residents during a drought -- well over 10 million more than during the last dry spell in the early 1990s. Much of the growth is due to massive and recent immigration.\n\nA record one in four current Californians was not born in the United States, according to the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. Whatever one's view on immigration, it is ironic to encourage millions of newcomers to settle in the state without first making commensurately liberal investments for them in water supplies and infrastructure.\n\nRELATED: The Dry Math of Scarcity\n\nSharp rises in population still would not have mattered much had state authorities just followed their forbearers' advice to continually increase water storage.\n\nEnvironmentalists counter that existing dams and reservoirs have already tapped out the state's potential to transfer water from the wet areas, where 75 percent of the snow and rain fall, to the dry regions, where 75 percent of the population prefers to reside.\n\nBut that analysis is incomplete.\n\nRELATED: No, Farmers Don't Use 80 Percent of California's Water\n\nAfter the initial phases of the federal Central Valley Project and state California Water Project were largely finished -- and flooding was no longer considered a dire threat in Northern California -- environmentalists in the last 40 years canceled most of the major second- and third-stage storage projects. To take a few examples, they stopped the raising of Shasta Dam, the construction of the Peripheral Canal, and gargantuan projects such as the Ah Pah and Dos Rios reservoirs.\n\nThose were certainly massive, disruptive, and controversial projects with plenty of downsides -- and once considered unnecessary in an earlier, much smaller California. But no one denies now that they would have added millions of acre-feet of water for 40 million people.\n\nLower foothill dams such as the proposed Sites, Los Banos, and Temperance Flat dams in wet years would have banked millions of acre-feet as insurance for dry years. All such reservoirs were also canceled.\n\nYet a single 1 million acre-foot reservoir can usually be built as cheaply as a desalinization plant. It requires a fraction of desalinization's daily energy use, leaves a much smaller carbon footprint, and provides almost 20 times as much water. California could have built perhaps 40-50 such subsidiary reservoirs for the projected $68 billion cost of the proposed high-speed rail project.\n\nNo one knows the exact figures on how many million acre-feet of water have been sent to the ocean since the beginning of the drought.\n\nCalifornia's dams and reservoirs were originally intended to meet four objectives: flood control, agricultural irrigation, recreation, and hydroelectric generation. The inevitable results of sustaining a large population and vibrant economy were dry summer rivers in the lowlands and far less water reaching the San Francisco Bay and delta regions.\n\nYet state planners once accepted those unfortunate tradeoffs. They would never have envisioned in a state of 40 million using the reservoirs in a drought to release water year-round for environmental objectives such as aiding the delta smelt or reintroducing salmon in the San Joaquin River watershed.\n\nNo one knows the exact figures on how many million acre-feet of water have been sent to the ocean since the beginning of the drought. Most agree that several million acre-feet slated for households or farming went out to sea.\n\nThere is more irony in opposing the construction of man-made and unnatural reservoirs, only to assume that such existing storage water should be tapped to ensure constant, year-round river flows. Before the age of reservoir construction, when rivers sometimes naturally dried up, such an environmental luxury may have impossible during dry years.\n\nAgriculture is blamed for supposedly using 80 percent of California's storage water and providing less than 5 percent of the state's GDP in return. But farming actually uses only about 40 percent of the state's currently available water. Agriculture's contribution to the state's GDP cannot be calibrated just by the sale value of its crops, but more accurately by thousands of subsidiary and spin-off industries such as fuel, machinery, food markets and restaurants that depend on the state's safe, reliable and relatively inexpensive food.\n\nThe recent rise of Silicon Valley has brought in more billions of dollars in revenue than century-old farming, but so far, no one has discovered how to eat a Facebook page or drink a Google search.\n\nStanford University, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley do not sit on natural aquifers sufficient to support surrounding populations. Only privileged water claims on transfers from Yosemite National Park, the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains, Northern California, or the Colorado River allow these near-desert areas along the coastal corridor to support some 20 million residents. Much of their imported water is used only once, not recycled, and sent out to sea.\n\nA final irony is that the beneficiaries of these man-made canals and dams neither allowed more water storage for others nor are willing to divert their own privileged water transfers to facilitate their own dreams of fish restoration. Nature may soon get back to normal -- but will California?", "When Michael Schurter checked the forecast on the Weather Underground website the other day, he saw that rain was on the way. And at the top of the page in the \"leaderboard\" spot where he would usually see an ad, he saw cats.\n\nThe Portland, Ore.-based programmer is one of more than 1,000 people who have been invited to test out Google Contributor. The program, still in beta and only in the United States, is an experiment by the world's largest digital-advertising company to allow people to pay to see fewer ads.\n\nGoogle Inc. announced the experiment last November and a new round of invites were recently sent to more testers.\n\nContributor works, so far, by allowing people to pay between $1 and $3 (U.S.) per month to strip out ads from websites they visit. Google can't promise a full ad-block, but it can eliminate the enormous number of online banner ads delivered through its Google Display Network, as well as a majority of the ads on sites of publishers who have partnered with Contributor. Google then parcels out that money, in dimes and pennies at a time, to the sites that participants visit.\n\nTest publisher websites include popular photo-sharing service Imgur, humour website The Onion and tech culture site Mashable, among others. (Google declined to be interviewed for this story, or to specify exactly how many people are testing Contributor or a full list of its publisher partners.)\n\nTesters can opt for white space in place of ads, a neutral-coloured box, a soft-focus blotch of colours - or cats.\n\n\"Even though I find ads as annoying as anyone else, I like the idea of giving money to the sites I visit and supporting them somehow,\" Mr. Schurter said. \"I know that content isn't free.\"\n\nThe experiment is just one part of a larger effort by Internet companies and content producers alike to test consumers' appetites for new revenue models to support publishers on the Web.\n\nRecently, publishers such as The New York Times have been negotiating with Facebook to allow the social-networking giant to host news content on Facebook itself, rather than making users click to visit the publishers' websites. Facebook would then sell ads against that content and split the revenue with publishers.\n\nIt's a daunting prospect, because publishers would be handing over control of a large number of readers' data, one of the most valuable assets they have when selling ads themselves. But it is also an attempt to reckon with the massive influence of social media and changing reading habits.\n\nThis week, as Google faces pushback on its market dominance from the European Union, the company announced a \u20ac150-million ($203-million) partnership with European news outlets to \"increase revenue, traffic and audience engagement.\" It will fund digital journalism projects, training for newsrooms, and research into the \"changing media landscape.\"\n\nAnd of course, some publishers, including The Globe and Mail and The New York Times, have introduced limits on the amount of free content they provide online. Digital subscriptions offer another source of revenue and control over that lucrative consumer data. But even consumers willing to pay for a subscription are unlikely to maintain multiple accounts across the Web.\n\n\"Everyone is trying to figure out who's going to pay,\" said Chris Williams, former president of IAB (the Interactive Advertising Bureau) Canada and now a digital advertising consultant. \"Historically, the power in the news world was with the publisher brands. ... These distribution pipes, the movement of the data, has become a much more powerful place than it was in the past.\"\n\nResistance to the dominant revenue model - advertising - has also increased. Outside of Google's experiment, more than 140 million people around the world already used ad-blocking software as of last December, up 69 per cent from the year before.\n\nAdblock Plus, which claims roughly 50 million active users, created a whitelist of publishers starting in 2011 to allow some of their ads to slip through its gatekeeping. Those ads must be unobtrusive - no popups, no animation, no low-quality \"from around the Web\" links that look like headlines in a supermarket tabloid. Parent company Eyeo GmbH charges a fee to the biggest publishers - including Google and Microsoft - to be on that whitelist. Less than 10 per cent of Adblock users opt out - suggesting people are open to advertising as long as it's not too annoying.\n\n\"It's great that people are exploring alternative monetization schemes,\" Ben Williams, director of public relations and marketing for Adblock Plus, said of Google's experiment. \"For the time being, online ads are going to be the main fuel for content, the main moneymaker. But it is beneficial to test other methods to wean us off ads. ... Google is in a position as a huge entity that can actually make something like this work.\"\n\nFor now, Mr. Schurter says he notices the cat pictures about as much as he used to notice banner ads - he's conditioned himself not to look at those spaces on the page. But Google's experiment is cheap enough that he thinks he'll keep paying.\n\n\"I have no love for ads, even though I've worked for marketing companies,\" he said. \"I would love an option to make it easy for me to support the sites I love without having to think about it.\"", "We've seen it demoed on stage. We used a janky (but amazing) prototype -- but until today we've never actually seen Microsoft's real holographic headset in person. Now, here it is: a weird, futuristic visor with four visible cameras, two speakers and what looks like six buttons.\n\nLet's take a closer look at hardware behind Microsoft's augmented, holographic, reality. This is HoloLens.\n\nHoloLens' smooth, curved plastic frame seems to invoke the style 1980s film makers imagined for the future. It's the vision of wearable computing I had as an elementary school student.\n\nThe headset's transparent displays (as well as an additional acrylic window) are easily viewable from down below, giving us a hint at how Microsoft will overlay your vision with holograms.\n\nYou can see a size adjustment wheel at the rear of HoloLens' headband -- which seems to be lined with a nice, comfy layer of felt.

It also looks like there are buttons on the end of the frame's outer chassis.\n\nRather than headphones, Microsoft has opted to place small, ambient \"floating audio\" speakers near the user's ears. Hopefully it's loud enough for the user but not so loud as to pollute the soundspace of others in the room.\n\nUp front you can see two of the headset's cameras -- there's an identical set on the other side of the visor. There are three additional cameras in-between the two pairs too, giving it a total of seven.\n\nViewed from above, we can see four more buttons -- two on each side of the top of the headband. You can also see here that the inner-headband is clearly separated from the outer, which allows it to pivot and adjust to the user's comfort.\n\nMicrosoft has primarily demoed HoloLens with voice and gesture controls, and these buttons seem to be in a kind of an odd place. Pressing a button or two just above your ear doesn't sound so odd, but the buttons on the back of the band are definitely not a naturally user friendly place. Our best guess is that they open a battery compartment or reveal charging / USB ports. We'll let you know when we know for sure.\n\nWhat are you thoughts, Gizmodo readers? Is this something you want to strap to your head? Would you feel silly using it? Is it better, or worse than Google Glass? Leave a comment and let us know what you think!", "Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe started a three-day visit to California on Thursday with plans to check out tech innovations, lend support to expanded commercial ties and even promote a Japanese-made bullet train during a meeting with the governor.\n\nDuring a speech at Stanford, Abe said Japan needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years.\n\nHe compared the effort to Japan sending baseball players to major league baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe said he plans to meet with Google and Facebook executives and visit electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nLater in the day, the Japanese leader will head to San Francisco and invite Gov. Jerry Brown to try a bullet train simulator that Abe brought on his trip, said Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.\n\nBrown is pushing a $68 billion high-speed rail project in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nAbe's itinerary also includes a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nDuring his three-day visit to California, Abe will also meet with Japanese-Americans in San Francisco and Los Angeles, encourage Japanese students who are studying in the state, and announce policies to facilitate U.S. investment in Japan.\n\nAbe planned to meet researchers later Thursday, including Japanese Nobel-winning stem cell researcher Shinya Yamanaka at the University of California, San Francisco-affiliated Gladstone Institute.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress.\n\nWhile on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nAbout 50 people protested outside the auditorium in Stanford where Abe spoke Thursday, chanting \"Abe go home!\" and carrying signs that called him a \"war crime denier.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Pennington in Washington and Olga R.

We wrote about it at the time here.\n\nIt's important because it seems that the impact of that downgrade still persists. It has doubtless had an detrimental effect on sellers and it's very much a spur behind eBay's new passion for product identifiers.\n\nI've picked out the comments made by Wenig on the call on the topic for your delectation. The full transcript can be read here.\n\nIn the scripted part of the call Devin Wenig said: \"We are certainly not ready to declare a victory over last year's SEO and password reset challenges but we are making progress. SEO-generated traffic is still impacting growth. While this channel is beginning to stabilize, effectively managing SEO traffic is a constantly evolving process. We're working to stay out front of it.\"\n\nWhen answering a question from an analyst, Wenig added:\n\n\"We grew up as a marketplace and eBay looks at the world historically through listings rather than products. Listings gave eBay a tremendous selection advantage. It's why we have the most things for sale of any marketplace in the world. But listings are also transient. They come and go. They don't have link equity and they're hard to attach content to. So if you go back over eBay's history, there's been a pattern of SEO disruptions across various search engines.\n\nWe now believe that the state of our business and our technology is that we can maintain the advantage given to us by a marketplace business model but include a structured data catalog, which gives us persistence and link equity and makes our sellers' inventory more discoverable, both on and off eBay . The way we're approaching that is, it is a deep transformation. It's a multiyear process. We're approaching it by category but horizontally but also focusing on the vertical areas where we believe we can have the most impact early on.\n\nI'd say we're off to a good start but it's an early start. And it will take -- it is a multiyear transformation. But we do know that where we structured and cataloged our inventory, those items are more discoverable on eBay and they're more persistent and generate more traffic through search engines and other digital channels. So we feel good about the approach but it is not a short-term fix.\"\n\nSo clearly, it's still a problem and eBay is actively trying to find a fix. But what's not clear is the extent to which their efforts are successful so far. And we're now nearly one year on.", "There was a time when we walked around with brick sized mobile phones, something which these days we simply look back at and laugh. Mobile phone manufacturers then spent years trying to pack in as much as they could into smaller and smaller mobile handsets. Yet as soon as this was perfected, we were introduced to the tablet - designed to make use of the users growing entertainment and browsing needs.\n\nBut now, just a few years on, it seems that mobile handsets are getting bigger and even tablets are starting to drop in size, like the iPad mini. So, are consumers ultimately looking for the perfect sized device that can do all the things they need it to on a daily basis yet still be a conveniently sized in order to carry around? And if so, surely it's a great gap in the market fit for the phablet.\n\nThe unfortunately nicknamed phablet merges together qualities of both a smartphone and a tablet, and dimension-wise, the screen itself is typically sized somewhere in between 5 and 7 inches. Even though on the face of things it may just seem like the phablet is simply a quickly tacked together hybrid put out there to appease both consumer markets, but now even smartphones are reaching the dizzying heights of 5+ inch sized screens. So what makes the likes of the iPhone Plus 6 or the Samsung Galaxy S6 want to head into phablet territory?\n\nIf we head all the way back to 1993 you may just about recall the AT&T EO 440 Personal Communicator. It has been described as the first true phablet, and this multitasking dinosaur did actually provide a combination of both phone, and what we now consider to be tablet-related, functionality. It was about the size of a small clipboard, and thanks to the wireless cellular network modem and built in microphone that it included, it also allowed you to make calls, fax and even email.\n\nThe EO 440 didn't exactly set the world alight and with the internet and the World Wide Web slowly snowballing through the 1990's it wouldn't be long before other technologies around us would soon help pave the way to new and innovative devices that could interact with these world changing technological advances.\n\nWhile the mobile phone was fast evolving itself in to the smartphone, at a time when the Internet had truly become a global phenomenon and when wireless networking technology had already begun to offer freedom and flexibility for many different industries, it did seem that the mid-naughties had so much more to offer creative developers and designers. Suddenly we leap forward to 2007 and are once more introduced to the coming together of phone and tablet technology but with something that had a lot more to offer than that of AT&T's effort in the early 90's.\n\nThe fresh-faced HTC Advantage X7500 was unleashed which was set to pave the way for future 'phablet'-esque devices to hit the market. It featured a magnetically attached keyboard, WiFi, Bluetooth, a USB 2.0 port, SIM and miniSDHC slots. It certainly piqued the interest of many consumers looking for something more than just a phone but something more portable and lightweight than laptops that were on offer at the time. The phablets biggest drawback came with its staggering price tag which certainly pushed many potential customers elsewhere.\n\nThere were plenty of less successful monikers soon after the Advantage such as the Nokia N810 WiMAX, the home based Verizon Hub, and the extremely bug-infested Dell Streak. It wasn't until 2012 when it looked like Samsung had finally constructed the best of both worlds with its memorable release of the Samsung Galaxy Note.\n\nThe new and shiny Android-based device was met with much praise from critics and consumers alike, which was apparent when it managed to sell over one million units in just the first two months of release. It went on to sell over 10 million units worldwide and has since been followed up with numerous new and improved editions being released each and every year since. The original Galaxy Note came with a crisp 1280 x 800 5.3 inch screen, a powerful 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, and utilized an S Pen stylus.\n\nIt's even more incredible to think that the Galaxy Note was actually criticized by some non-believers when it first arrived. Many believed that the device was actually laughable when it was being used as an actual phone. Its 5.3 inch screen was the main cause of concern, a great size for working on but how could holding such an oversized handset be comfortable or respectable? I mean this wasn't the early 90's anymore! But it had more than limited appeal and people responded positivity to the screen increase. Had the market changed, did we want more phone, phablet, or tablet for our money?\n\nFast track to today and there is at least one phablet from every major smartphone manufacturer, even some from companies less known to consumers in larger markets like the U.S., like Huawei's Ascend Mate 7. The Mate 7 is a great display at how far the design of phablets have come with a sleek metal body, but it also showcases that phablets are a device category that is popular with consumers the world over. Samsung has popularized the phablet category with their successful 'Galaxy Note' series of devices, which is now currently in its 4th iteration with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Note Edge, both offering Samsung's best technology in a phablet device to date with improved S-Pen functionality, a better screen and improved camera. It's also sporting the biggest display of any Note device so far. Bigger still is the Samsung Galaxy Mega, which is an absolutely massive device. It harbors on the edge of being perhaps slightly too large coming in at 6.3-inches, but nevertheless there was still a market for people who had a need for a screen of that size.\n\nWhile Samsung's phablet devices are easily the front runners (at least the Galaxy Note series), others have stepped up to grab hold of a piece of the market in what is now clearly a more acceptable size for a smartphone. LG responded to Samsung's Galaxy Note and Galaxy Mega with their own LG Vu, putting their own spin on a phablet with a more oddball aspect ratio. Dell and HTC also entered into the mix with the Dell Streak and HTC One Max devices, providing consumers and loyal fans of their respective brands with an option for a smartphone with a larger screen size. Google and Motorola have partnered together for 2014's Nexus device with the Nexus 6, sporting one of the biggest displays on a more well-known smartphone. This is of course after Sony had released its Xperia Z Ultra much earlier, which not only came in its original form with the stock Sony UI but was also granted (for a time) a spot in the Google Play Store's 'Devices' section as one of the Google Play Edition smartphones, sporting a 6-inch display with Sony hardware and the loveable stock Android experience of a Nexus.\n\nHas the market changed, do we want more phone, phablet, or tablet for our money? Most definitely their is a market for large screen smartphones, in fact whole ranges of them you can pick up at The Smart Phone Company, and it doesn't look like users these days mind whatsoever about resting their cheek and ear up against these hefty new devices to keep in touch with family and friends.", "There was a time, not so long ago, when Microsoft and computing were synonymous. Since then, Macs have carved out their own slice of the marketplace, and devices like smartphones and tablets have muddied the boundaries of the PC's reach.\n\nMicrosoft is preparing to undo all that.\n\nWe've all heard the marketing spiel about a unified user experience across Windows PCs, phones, and tablets. Microsoft's 2015 BUILD keynote assembled all the pieces into one impressive whole. This isn't just a clever line for an ad campaign, it's a comprehensive attempt to turn Windows from an OS into multi-platform ecosystem.\n\nMillions of people around the world use Windows for work and at home. However, with the concept of the PC becoming more intangible, Microsoft is clearly aware it could eventually be in trouble if it doesn't expand. Windows needs to become more than just the OS most use on their PC. Microsoft has known that for years, but now it actually has a workable plan to achieve its goal.\n\nBringing developers on board\n\nMicrosoft wants to offer the same experience to Windows users on their phones and tablets as experienced by those on their desktop computer. A similar experience isn't enough. Only the real thing will suffice, as proven by Continuum. The devices will matter less and less, because they're simply conduits to give users access to Windows.\n\nJust as you can upload a clip of your best performance in Halo directly from your Xbox One to your OneDrive, or sync a tidbit from OneNote across your phone, tablet and laptop, expect to see your Windows devices become increasingly intertwined. Some might find the trend annoying, but many will love how it makes common tasks easier.\n\nAny platform is only as good as the software that can be used on it, and that's why Windows is way behind in mobile.\n\nMicrosoft made sure to push this movement heavily at BUILD, because the developers in attendance are the ones who will make the company's vision a reality. Any platform is only as good as the software that can be used on it, and Microsoft are going wide in the hopes of delivering as much quality content to their users as is possible.\n\nRelated: Microsoft's new browser is officially named Edge, supports Chrome and Firefox extensions\n\nWe saw plenty of different coding languages producing software for a host of devices during Microsoft's BUILD keynote, and that wasn't any coincidence. Whether it's offering up a more open version of the Office suite with support for custom-made add-ins, or providing an Android emulator as part of Visual Studio, Microsoft is designing tools to make Windows the home of development.\n\nBeyond that, there's the key element of crossover between Windows 10 on all platforms. Microsoft wants to make it as easy as possible for development to cover PCs, tablets and phones. That goal is to make programming for Windows more appealing, and thus populate the Windows Store with the sort of apps users want to download.\n\nEngaging the audience\n\nWith developers committed to the advantages Windows allows them, Microsoft can aggressively court consumers. A well-stocked Store will tempt Windows emigrates back to the OS, and there is already a plan to keep them on board afterwards.\n\nTake Cortana, for instance. Personal assistant software still seems likely to capture the imagination of the mainstream, but Microsoft's version seems to have an underpinning that ties into their aim of broadening the reach of Windows as a whole. Cortana has been touted as an assistant that will learn about user's habits and interests to deliver the best possible service. We saw a slight twist on that idea in Microsoft's BUILD keynote, where Joe Belfiore explained some changes to the Windows Lock Screen.\n\nThe new Spotlight feature will expand upon promotional efforts to publicize Windows Store content. Users will be able to tell their device what interests them and what doesn't, similar to the system currently in place as part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview to customize Lock Screen wallpapers.\n\nOn the surface, it's a minor point, but Belfiore's wording when demonstrating the functionality might illuminate its greater purpose. He referred to users teaching their device about their preferences, which suggests much more of a relationship than simply checking a box in the Control Panel.\n\nMicrosoft is attempting to develop the relationship between users and the Windows OS over time. Between a work PC, a tablet for recreational use and a smartphone, users will be able to train Windows to fit into their life just as they desire. And once that's done, it'll be hard for said users to jump to another OS.\n\nCapturing the future\n\nMicrosoft is looking to the future while keeping its focus on real world applications. And if that's not interesting enough, well, the company has HoloLens in its back pocket when it needs to deliver the wow factor.\n\nMaybe, in 10 years, we'll use holograms as casually as touch screens are engaged with today. Maybe not. But it's something for Windows users to look forward to.\n\nAccessing your Excel spreadsheets from your phone is undoubtedly practical, but it doesn't have the same impact that interacting with a virtual dinosaur skeleton does. Technology needs a little spectacle to grab the consumer's attention, and Microsoft have delivered just that alongside their more functional developments.\n\nRelated: Windows 10 isn't just a step back to the desktop, it's a step up\n\nMaybe, in 10 years, we'll use holograms as casually as touch screens are engaged with today. Maybe not. The point is, it's something for Windows users to look forward to. It signifies that Microsoft has ideas for the future. That's key if consumers are going to evangelize for Microsoft the way others do for Apple and Google.\n\nMicrosoft wants to make Windows more all-encompassing than ever before, going beyond the PC platform to deliver a truly device-agnostic service. That desire isn't just about technology. It's about recapturing the pioneer spirit that launched the company to the top 40 years ago.", "\"OK Google, where are the open houses in Chicago?\" That's a question that might yield a useful response for Android users, now that Zillow's real estate service is integrated into Google's voice search.\n\nSeveral new integrations hit Google's voice search system for Android devices on Thursday, which lets people conduct queries orally by first saying, \"OK Google.\" In addition to Zillow, Shazam, NPR and online radio service TuneIn have been integrated.\n\nThe integrations require users to have those other apps on their smartphone or tablet. But instead of having to open the apps individually, users can ask their mobile device directly, which, hopefully, will then take them inside the appropriate app with an answer.\n\nThe Zillow integration will work for local searches as well as housing searches in other cities. Users, for instance, can search for homes for sale, for rent, or for open houses. \"Show apartments for rent in Boston on Zillow,\" you could say.\n\nWith TuneIn, users can say, \"Open TuneIn in car mode.\" That would be helpful for hands-free driving.\n\nThrough the Shazam integration, people can ask their smartphone what song is playing around them, by saying, \"OK Google, Shazam this song.\" (Google voice search already lets people identify songs without Shazam.)\n\nSince Google opened outside support for its OK Google voice search in 2014, developers of many other third party apps have integrated their apps into the system. There's also tons of useful commands that can be conducted using Google's own smarts.\n\nIts functionalities extend beyond search. The \"OK Google\" command is also now a key element in how people interact with smartwatches running Google's Android Wear operating system.", "Thanks to a lower power requirement than Google Inc.'s Android Wear OS, the Kood system gives the fitness-centric VivoWatch a battery life of 10 days, Asustek said.\n\nThe VivoWatch features a 123mAh battery, much smaller than the 369mAh battery used in Asustek's Android Wear-based ZenWatch, which lasts up to two days on a single charge.\n\nThe VivoWatch is also equipped with a 1.28-inch black-and-white touchscreen that uses Sharp Corp.'s memory LCD technology, which embeds 1-bit memory in every pixel, changing only the part of the image that requires updating and requiring very little power.\n\nWhile most other smartwatches in the market are running mobile processors, the VivoWatch runs only a microcontroller unit made by STMicroelectronics N.V. and a firmware developed by Asustek.\n\nIt means users will not be able to install apps on the watch, which can only synchronize data with phones running on Android 4.3 or later and with iPhones running on iOS 8.1 or later, according to Asustek.\n\nThe VivoWatch will go on sale in Taiwan on May 8 at NT$4,588 (US$149) as part of an initial roll-out in 10 markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France and other European countries, Asustek said.", "Photos Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe Dow has lost almost all its gains this year.\n\nIt plunged over 195 points Thursday, losing almost all its momentum for the year.

But while that was definitely the case a decade or so ago, big changes in the domain name industry have been happening in the last year or so.\n\nThink of it as the evolution or even the second dawn of the internet: We've gone from having 100 to 150 different domain suffixes, including those we all know so well -- .net, .edu, .it, .uk, etc. -- to having many times that number: as many as 1,500 gTLDs.\n\nMore importantly, though we don't know what the real secret sauce is at Google, we do know that the search engine is now paying more attention to searches that include key words. So, if there's a key word as part of your new domain name, Google is treating that as part of the search.\n\nLet's take the example of Barack Obama's favorite plumber, Joe. Not long ago, the best Joe's Plumbing could hope for would have been joesplumbing.com. Now, Joe can buy joes.plumbing. Moreover, Google will treat the whole term as the search term, potentially giving the searcher better results.\n\nGot some creative wheels spinning? This is a significant change -- a chance for small businesses to tie up the key words associated with certain domain names. The other good news is that you're talking about a very small investment. You can purchase many of these domain names for $29 to $39 or so apiece -- and you'll be amazed at what's still available.\n\nWe've worked with some businesses that have looked up very generic terms, like office.lighting and street.lighting. Those domain names were (and perhaps still are) available, and more are being bought up every day. Additionally, every single week brings a new release of more of these new suffixes.\n\nFor example, .app is due out in the next couple of months; so is .site. Do you sell team t-shirts, or is your company otherwise involved in sports? You might be interested in other incipient newcomers such as .football and .tennis, both due out in the first half of 2015.\n\nThe message here: If you missed out on securing your business or project name back in the .com days, here is a new, real-time 2015 opportunity for small businesses to shore up or launch their online presence. Hundreds of new domain names are out there now, and they're available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nYou can register names at domain name registrars such as GoDaddy.com, Easily.com, Speednames.com and NetworkSolutions.com. So, grab yours before they're all picked over -- while you can still get exactly the name(s) you want.", "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -\n\nThe Dow has lost almost all its gains this year.\n\nIt plunged over 195 points Thursday, losing almost all its momentum for the year.

Ted Lieu lambasts gov't request for more access to encrypted devices.\n\nDespite the best efforts of law enforcement to convince a Congressional subcommittee that technology firms actually need to weaken encryption in order to serve the public interest, lawmakers were not having it.\n\nDaniel Conley, the district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, testified Wednesday before the committee that companies like Apple and Google were helping criminals by hardening encryption on their smartphones. He echoed previous statements by the recently-departed Attorney General, Eric Holder.\n\n\"In America, we often say that none of us is above the law,\" Conley wrote in his prepared testimony. \"But when unaccountable corporate interests place crucial evidence beyond the legitimate reach of our courts, they are in fact placing those who rape, defraud, assault and even kill in a position of profound advantage over victims and society.\"\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who described himself as a \"recovering computer science major,\" provided one of the most forceful counter-arguments. (He is just one of four House members with computer science degrees.) Lieu also is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves and served for four years as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps.\n\n\"It is clear to me that creating a pathway for decryption only for good guys is technologically stupid, you just can't do that,\" he said, underscoring that he found Conley's remarks \"offensive.\"\n\nHe argued:\n\nIt's a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem. Why do you think Apple and Google are doing this? It's because the public is demanding it. People like me: privacy advocates. A public does not want a an out of surveillance state. It is the public that is asking for this. Apple and Google didn't do this because they thought they would make less money. This is a private sector response to government overreach.\n\nThen you make another statement that somehow these companies are not credible because they collect private data. Here's the difference: Apple and Google don't have coercive power. District attorneys do, the FBI does, the NSA does, and to me it's very simple to draw a privacy balance when it comes to law enforcement and privacy: just follow the damn Constitution.\n\nAnd because the NSA didn't do that and other law enforcement agencies didn't do that, you're seeing a vast public reaction to this. Because the NSA, your colleagues, have essentially violated the Fourth Amendment rights of every American citizen for years by seizing all of our phone records, by collecting our Internet traffic, that is now spilling over to other aspects of law enforcement. And if you want to get this fixed, I suggest you write to NSA: the FBI should tell the NSA, stop violating our rights. And then maybe you might have much more of the public on the side of supporting what law enforcement is asking for.\n\nThen let me just conclude by saying I do agree with law enforcement that we live in a dangerous world. And that's why our founders put in the Constitution of the United States -- that's why they put in the Fourth Amendment. Because they understand that an Orwellian overreaching federal government is one of the most dangerous things that this world can have. I yield back.\n\nFundamental misunderstanding\n\nWhen Ars contacted Lieu after the Wednesday hearing he said that he was not surprised at the testimony of Conley and others in law enforcement.\n\n\"They have a job to do and it is in their interest to make access to data by law enforcement as easy as possible,\" he told Ars by e-mail.\n\n\"But I was surprised at their rhetoric stating that companies seeking to protect and encrypt Americans' data from unconstitutional government intrusion are implicitly helping terrorists and criminals,\" he said. \"That view reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue. Private-sector technology companies are responding to the American people's demand that our current out-of-control surveillance state be brought under control.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on his \"technologically stupid\" comment regarding backdoors, Lieu wrote:\n\nBackdoors create unnecessary vulnerability to otherwise secure systems that can be exploited by bad actors. Backdoors are also problematic because once one government asks for special treatment, then other governments with fewer civil liberties protections will start asking for special treatment. In addition, computer code is neutral and unthinking. It cannot tell if the person typing on a keyboard trying to access private data is the FBI Director, a hacker, or the leader of Hamas as long as that person has the cryptographic key or other unlocking code. The view that computer backdoors can only be used by \"good guys\" reflects a lack of understanding of basic computer technology.\n\nBut, when asked what steps Lieu takes in his personal or professional life to protect his digital security, he simply responded: \"That's private.\"\n\nThe entire hearing, which runs two hours and 15 minutes, is viewable below.", "The Obama administration is pressuring the Abbott government to back away from plans to target American technology multinationals for higher taxes.\n\nGoogle Australia's tax bill has risen by $4.6 million to $11.7 million, but the technology giant still hasn't counted its lucrative search engine business revenue that gets instead booked offshore.\n\nIts financial accounts, lodged with ASIC late on Thursday, show that for year ending December 31 2014, Google Australia booked revenue of $438.7 million, up $81 million from $357.7 million in 2013.\n\nGoogle's accounts also show that the company paid $11.7 million tax on profit of $58.7 million in 2014. Profit was up from $46.5 million the year before.\n\nGoogle Australia and New Zealand managing director Maile Carnegie. Photo: Christopher Pearce\n\nBut its tax bill is only a fraction of its Australian profits, which don't count for more than $2 billion worth of income it earns through advertising locally on its lucrative search engine business.\n\nGoogle is among a number of technology companies - including Apple, Microsoft, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto - that are under audit by the Australian Taxation Office for their use of marketing hubs in Singapore.\n\n\"We've invested nearly $1 billion dollars in Australia over the last three years, employing a local workforce of 1200 people,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"There is always more we can do, but we are deeply committed to providing great products for Australians, and supporting our customers here.\"\n\nGoogle, headquartered in the United States, says it global corporate tax rate is 19 per cent for 2014, and it incurred taxes of $3.3 billion.\n\nIts Australian arm claimed $4.9 million in the research and development tax offset.\n\nThe company said it paid $19.7 million in payroll and \"other\" taxes such as fringe benefits in Australia.\n\nGoogle Australia's managing director, Maile Carnegie, recently told the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance that their tax arrangements were well within the law.\n\nThere are estimates Google's tax rate in Singapore is as low as 10 per cent.\n\nMs Carnegie did not confirm how much tax the company paid in the island nation, but confirmed to the inquiry earlier this month that the tax generated from Google's advertising revenue, is paid in Singapore.\n\n\"Google Australia provides sales and marketing services to Google Singapore, and we get basically revenue for those services,\" she said in evidence to the inquiry.\n\nBut Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan later gave evidence disputing the claims made by Google and the other companies under audit who had given testimony.\n\nHe said that while Google paid some tax in Singapore, \"we believe it's a very small amount as revenue booked in Singapore is moved to a tax haven, Bermuda, through a series of licensing fee payments\".\n\n\"This means the majority of profits made in Australia end up in Bermuda where no tax is paid.\"\n\nMr Jordan - who pledged the agency will beat a budget target of hitting $1.1 billion in revenue from multinationals by 2017 - expects to finalise audits by the end of the year.\n\nSo far the ATO has raised $250 million in liabilities through audits of multinationals, but this amount does not include the 12 tech companies under audit.\n\nIn the meantime, the Abbott government wants to work with the United Kingdom to implement interim measures to tax multinationals. It could announce new measures in the May budget, just months before the OECD hands down its final plan.\n\nThe OECD has been tasked by G20 governments to deliver a plan that stops companies profit shifting. This plan is due by October, but the immense public pressure mounting on political leaders to act fast, means that they could move sooner in introducing or beefing up domestic tax laws.\n\nMs Carnegie told the inquiry she was against the federal government taking unilateral action. \"It will add more complexity and more uncertainty and will lead to less innovation and less growth and job creation,\" she said.", "Share Tweet Pin Email By Olivia Bahou Shares Share Tweet Pin Email Most Read EvilAngel.com Share Tweet Pin\n\nKelly Diamond, a production assistant at Saturday Night Live, grew up fielding jokes about her birth name. \"Which strip club you dancing at this week?\" was one of the most frequent, she tells BroBible.

Toshiba has outfitted the Portege Z20t with an Intel Core M processor, which makes for a slim, fanless design, but compared with competitors like the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 or the Editors' Choice business ultrabook Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series (E7450), there's a big gap to deal with in terms of productivity and performance.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Portege Z20t consists of a standalone tablet with a keyboard you can attach for laptop use and extra battery power. When used in Laptop mode, the Portege Z20t is thin and light enough to qualify for Intel's Ultrabook branding, measuring just 0.83 by 12.2 by 8.5 inches (HWD), and weighing only 3.3 pounds. The tablet alone makes the system an even more portable 1.6 pounds, and is a scant 0.35-inch thick.\n\nThe 12.5-inch display has a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio. While many tablet designs have moved away from the 16:9 aspect ratio, it still works quite well for laptop displays, though it does make for a tablet that feels especially long when held in Portrait orientation. The screen has a matte finish that effectively reduces glare and reflections, but the surface tends to flex a lot under the press of a finger or stylus. Two built-in speakers along the bottom edge of the tablet provide stereo sound, but there's not a lot of separation between the two speakers, even with the help of DTS Studio Sound software.\n\nThe docking connection is also unique in\n\nthat you can connect the tablet in one of two ways: facing forward in Laptop mode, or backward, both for use in Display mode or folded closed for Tablet mode without leaving the keyboard behind.\n\nThe docking keyboard features a backlit, chiclet-style layout, and it's spill-resistant, so while you still won't want to use it in the rain, you can get some work done at Starbucks without the fear of a splashed latte ruining your system. A blue Accupoint pointing stick in the center of the keyboard gives you cursor control without taking your fingers off the home keys, and a regular touchpad provides touch and gesture support.\n\nWhen using the tablet, you'll have access to Microsoft's on-screen keyboard and handwriting tools. Unfortunately, our review unit was set up with Windows 7 Pro (still available to businesses through Windows 8.1 downgrade rights), which doesn't have the best touch interface. Toshiba improves the situation slightly with an active digitizer pen (which includes buttons on the pen's grip for right-click functions) and a second \"emergency\" stylus (with no buttons) that stows in the tablet chassis, but the end result is a system that works best as a laptop rather than a tablet.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe tablet is outfitted with a micro HDMI port, a micro USB port, a microSD Card slot, and a headset jack. There are also physical buttons for power and volume control. For wireless connectivity, the system is equipped with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0, along with support for Intel Wi-Di media streaming.\n\nThe tablet features two built-in cameras: a front-facing, 2-megapixel webcam and a rear-facing, 5-megapixel camera with auto-focus and digital zoom. The webcam is pretty good, and well-suited to video chat services, like Skype and Google Hangouts. The rear-facing camera, however, was less than satisfactory in our testing. The 5-megapixel resolution is relatively low -- recent competitors have been equipped with 8-megapixel cameras -- and the camera struggled to compensate for dark shadows or bright light.\n\nThe tablet boasts a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD) for storage. That's on par with other tablets and convertibles, like the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro, but you will find larger storage capacities offered in some laptops, like the Acer Aspire R 13 (R7-371T-72TC), which has a 512GB SSD. Because it's a business system, the Portege Z20t is also equipped with Trusted Platform Module (TPM v1.2). Toshiba doesn't include much extra software on the Portege Z20t, but it does come with a free 30-day trial of both McAfee Live Safe Internet Security and Microsoft Office for new customers, and some Toshiba-branded utilities for things like power settings and disk management. Toshiba covers the Portege Z20t with a three-year warranty.\n\nPerformance\n\nOur review unit has an Intel Core M-5Y71 CPU with 8GB of RAM and Intel HD Graphics 5300. The Core M processor line is built to provide better performance than Intel's low-powered Atom processors, but better heat- and energy-efficiency than the Core i5 CPUs found in competing systems. As a result, the Portege Z20t's performance was pretty good on our tests, but predictably fell behind its Core-i5-equipped competitors. For instance, it was slightly slower in tests like PCMark 8 Work Conventional (2,607 points), Handbrake (4 hours 13 minutes), and Adobe Photoshop CS6 (5:16) than the Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series (E7450) or the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, which both offer Core i5 processing.\n\nGraphics performance is also competent, but not stellar, relying upon the integrated Intel HD Graphics 5300 solution. Its 3DMark scores of 3,690 points in CloudGate and 222 in Fire Strike Extreme make it pretty clear that this system will do well with basic graphics demands, like video streaming and rendering graphics-heavy websites, but it may occasionally lag, and there is a noticeable difference between the Core M's graphics processing and the integrated solution offered by a Core i5 or Core i7 processor. With single-digit frame rates in Heaven and Valley, gaming is pretty much out of the question on this system, aside from simple browser-based games like Candy Crush.", "As smartphones become increasingly complex pocket computers, using them as actual phones has remained pretty straightforward. Meanwhile, it's no secret that Facebook wants to broaden its mobile presence. So with Facebook Hello, the company is looking to reinvent the phone part of smartphones. This free Android app augments phone calls with all the information the social network has to provide. While Facebook Hello doesn't offer any radical new features, and it's lacking in key areas like text blocking, it does bring you the Facebook you know and love in a useful, new, caller-friendly format.\n\nHello, Facebook Hello\n\nFacebook Hello is essentially a new skin for your Android phone's existing dialer. The app filters incoming calls and presents them in that familiar Facebook blue as long as it's installed. Users don't necessarily have to use Hello when making a call, but then why download the app to begin with? Hello is currently available exclusively for Android phones, and I tested the app on a Moto X.\n\nWhereas Facebook Home, a similar skin app, wanted to take over your entire phone, to mixed results, Facebook Hello is much more focused. Users gain access to all of their Facebook data while calling. Despite this more specific function, the app has a variety of uses. If your friend has their phone number listed on their profile, Hello will display that profile whenever they call. Being able to see someone's job title, mutual friends, and even their birthday before answering the phone makes this feature a more robust Caller ID. However, you can't add a number to a contact without one already listed. Then again, you shouldn't be giving Facebook someone's private information without that person's permission anyway.\n\nSmarter Phone Calls\n\nFacebook Hello's other features recall another Facebook mobile experiment: Facebook Paper. Both apps tell users nothing they couldn't already look up for themselves. Instead, they recontextualize that knowledge for the user's convenience. Say you're looking for a new place to eat. Sure you can already search for names, menus, numbers, locations, and directions on the Web. But if the restaurant is listed on Facebook, Hello users can read reviews, call for reservations, and hop over to Google Maps all within the app. The system streamlines what can often be a clunky and annoying online process, especially on a cramped phone screen with limited Internet access. It's an intelligent new method to leverage old content. The Facebook information occasionally proved more accurate than other online sources during my testing, probably because small businesses love to stay active on social media.\n\nBy rolling out a series of smaller, niche apps as opposed to bigger, more comprehensive ones, Facebook wants to encourage you, and your precious contact info, to stay within its ecosystem. Having these different apps communicate with each other in different ways also incentivizes users to download them all. Facebook Hello users can text their friends instead of calling them, as long as they have Facebook Messenger installed as well. Messenger's recent free voice and video call updates make phone numbers even less necessary while making Facebook's walls even cozier.\n\nUnfriended\n\nMessenger support is Facebook Hello's only texting option, though, and this reveals the app's largest flaw. Because Hello has no SMS integration, none of its number-blocking features apply to text messages. Apps like PrivacyStar, Truecaller, and Editor's Choice Mr. Number all block texts along with calls. Those apps also have more expansive call-blocking features like area code-blocking and reverse number lookup. Facebook Hello users are out of luck when it comes to fully preventing unwanted contact.", "Twilio's free Authy service makes securing your website and applications with two-factor authentication just about as easy as it can be. It does everything Google Authenticator can do, and more.\n\nA password is a terrible way to protect an online account, because anybody who learns your password owns the account, even if they're half a world away. A password manager lets you use tough-to-remember passwords, but in a data breach it doesn't matter if your password was \"*txE6xVy$rjMO@0t\" or \"password.\" You can vastly enhance your security by using a two-factor authentication scheme, and Twilio's Authy makes two-factor authentication easier than ever.\n\nExperts divide authentication factors into three types: something you know (a password, for example), something you have (a physical object), and something you are (a fingerprint or other biometric trait). Authy turns your smartphone into a physical token that's needed for login, along with the password. A hacker who steals or guesses your password will be foiled by the authentication step that requires that token.\n\nHow It Works\n\nIn 2011, the Internet Engineering Task Force released a standard for Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). The concept is simple enough. When the user registers a TOTP-supporting device with a secure website, a unique shared key is created. Both the device and the server can generate a time-based one-time password by processing that key along with the current time. By convention, each TOTP is good for 30 seconds. You log in using your regular password, then enter the current one-time password from your device, and you're in. A malefactor who somehow plucks that one-time password out of the ether will find it useless within 30 seconds.\n\nAuthy and Google Authenticator both build on TOTP, and in fact you can use Authy on any site that supports Google Authenticator. Why would you switch to Authy? There are quite a few reasons; I'll go into detail later.\n\nGetting Started With Authy\n\nSetting up Authy to use your smartphone as a token is simple. You install the Authy app on the phone, give it your phone number, and either click a verification link or enter a verification code. That's it; Authy is ready to use. Getting started on my Apple iPhone 6 took almost no time.\n\nThe exact technique for setting up two-factor authentication varies from site to site. However, for most sites you'll follow the prompts until you get a chance to select Google Authenticator. At that point, the site displays a QR code. Snap the QR code with Authy and bam! You've got two-factor authentication. Digging into the app, I found that it directly supports at least two dozen popular sites, among them Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, Lastpass, Evernote, and WordPress. Over 10,000 other websites and applications, large and small, use Authy directly for authentication, with no connection to Google Authenticator.\n\nYour registered sites appear across the bottom of the app's window. Tapping one brings up the current authentication code for that site, along with a countdown timer that shows how much of the code's 30-second lifetime remains. It works much the same on Android and iOS, though I observed that the iOS edition displays a circular progress bar with a label counting down seconds while the Android edition just uses a simple progress bar.\n\nOf course, if a hacker with pocket-picking skills manages to obtain both your password and your authentication smartphone, you could be in trouble. As with the strictly device-based security used by oneID, you need to secure your device thoroughly. Use a strong passcode, or biometric authentication, and turn on Authy's PIN protection (iPhone users can upgrade to Touch ID authentication).\n\nLastPass 3.0 and LastPass 3.0 Premium both support Google Authenticator. That means you can protect your LastPass account using Authy, and then go on to use Authy for two-factor authentication of your other secure sites. You could do the same with Dashlane 3.\n\nMulti-Device Features\n\nYou need a smartphone to get started with Authy, but once that task is accomplished you can install Authy on other smartphones, tablets, or desktops, and sync data between the devices. Authy supports iOS, Android, and BlackBerry mobile devices, as well as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. There's even an Authy app for the Apple Watch; just glance at your wrist for the authentication code.\n\nBy installing the Authy desktop app and Chrome extension, you can bypass the smartphone altogether. The desktop app prompts you to create a master password, but doesn't require it (an oversight, in my opinion). Note that the master password is device-specific, so if you install on multiple desktops you could conceivably create multiple master passwords. When the master password is in place, the app requires you to re-enter it periodically. Using the Chrome extension, you can get the current code for any of your registered sites, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it in, with no need to get out your phone.\n\nYes, this is definitely chipping away at the definition of two-factor authentication. Someone who has access to your desktop computer could conceivably break in, because the desktop computer becomes the \"something you have\" factor. If you choose to use the Authy desktop app, you absolutely must protect it with a strong master password. In addition, you should password-protect your user account on the desktop and lock the account any time you step away.\n\nThere's another benefit to the Chrome extension that I didn't notice right away. If you click to view the current code for a site, and that site isn't open, you'll get a phishing warning. That's handy!\n\nEnabling Authy on another smartphone or tablet is a snap. On the new device, you enter the phone number of your smartphone, and respond to an access prompt that appears on that smartphone. Just like that, Authy is enabled on the new device.\n\nLost a device? You can use the Authy app to remove that device from the sync process. Note, though, that for sites using Google's implementation of TOTP the token will continue to supply codes for already-registered sites. A prudent user will disable and re-enable two-factor authentication on these sites.\n\nIf you've enrolled all the devices you want, you can set Authy to stop accepting more devices. There's also an option to save an encrypted backup of your secure keys to the cloud.\n\nI noticed a Bluetooth option in the Authy iOS app. I enabled it, but couldn't find any way to make it interact with my PC. It turns out this feature is Mac-specific, and that even on Mac it's having trouble with some recent changes in Bluetooth implementation.\n\nWhy Authy?\n\nI mentioned earlier that you can use Authy on any site that supports Google Authenticator. But why would you bother? Well, Authy is just better in a number of ways.\n\nWhen you set up an account to authenticate via Google Authenticator, your access to that account on mobile devices is cut off. You must enter a lengthy all-lowercase \"application password\" to re-enable access for each application on each device. Authy users can simply install Authy on the device, obviating the need for this annoying process.\n\nIf you get a new phone, you can easily transfer over all of your Authy registrations. With Google Authenticator, you'd have to go through the registration process again for every site. And Google Authenticator doesn't offer any way to revoke access for a lost or stolen phone.\n\nThe whole concept of time-based passwords breaks down if the client and server aren't synchronized time-wise. Authy has a reputation for staying in sync even when your device doesn't have network access, more so than Google Authenticator. However, I didn't find a way to test this.", "A roundup of trading on major world markets:\n\nNEW YORK - Wall Street stocks have fallen sharply as earnings from online listings company Yelp and others disappointed while US data showed only modest growth in consumer spending.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday dropped 195.01 points (1.08 per cent) to 17,840.52.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 fell 21.34 (1.01 per cent) to 2,085.51, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 82.22 (1.64 per cent) to 4,941.42.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYelp plummeted 23.2 per cent after forecasting second-quarter sales of $US131-$US134 million ($A164-$A167 million), below Wall Street projections of $US138.4 million. Analysts also rapped the company for a weak performance in attracting users.\n\nMichael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said government data showing consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in March was \"a little underwhelming\" after Wednesday's \"terrible\" report on first-quarter economic growth.\n\n\"As you've had continually worse economic numbers, that's only increased the concerns about an economic slowdown,\" he said.\n\nTech stocks were especially weak, with Apple falling 2.7 per cent, and Facebook and Google both dropping 2.1 per cent.\n\nAnother Nasdaq sector, biotechs, reacted poorly to a disappointing earnings report from Celgene, which posted sales of $US2.06 billion, below the $US2.11 billion analyst forecast.\n\nCelgene, which also gave a disappointing earnings forecast, fell 4.5 per cent. Amgen lost 1.9 per cent and Biogen shed 2.6 per cent.\n\nLONDON - European stocks have posted gains as the euro hit a nine-week dollar high on weak US data that dimmed the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in early summer.\n\nMarkets had fallen sharply on the previous day after news that the world's biggest economy grew by just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter, well below the one per cent rate anticipated by analysts.\n\nBut on Thursday, European equities were given a lift by eurozone data showing that the bloc has climbed out of four months of deflation.\n\nFrankfurt's DAX 30 index gained 0.19 per cent to 11,454.38 points while in Paris the CAC 40 was up 0.14 per cent at 5,046.49 points, ahead of the May 1 holiday weekend.\n\nTrading at both markets will resume on Monday.\n\nLondon's benchmark FTSE 100 index closed 0.21 per cent higher at 6,960.63 points. Friday is a business day in London, with markets shut only on Monday for a bank holiday.\n\nHONG KONG - Most Asian stock markets have slipped with US growth data falling well short of forecasts.\n\nThe dollar sat at two-month lows against the euro on Thursday as the chances of an interest rate hike in early summer faded.\n\nThe single currency was also supported by hopes Greece will reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors.\n\nTokyo tumbled 2.69 per cent, or 538.94 points, to 19,520.01 as exporters were hit by the stronger yen, while Shanghai fell 0.78 per cent, or 34.97 points, to 4,441.65.\n\nHong Kong shed 0.94 per cent, or 267.34 points, to 28,133.00, while Seoul fell 0.72 per cent, or 15.46 points, to end at 2,127.17.\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Wednesday the US economy grew at an annualised rate of 0.2 per cent in January-February, far short of the 1.0 per cent projected by analysts.\n\nThe result is the latest indicating weakness in the world's number one economy.\n\nWELLINGTON - New Zealand shares have rebounded from a two-month low, paced by Spark New Zealand and Contact Energy as the prospect of lower interest rates fuelled investor demand for income-paying equities.\n\nThe NZX 50 Index rose 50.52 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5791.336 on Thursday.", "\"OK Google, where are the open houses in Chicago?\" That's a question that might yield a useful response for Android users, now that Zillow's real estate service is integrated into Google's voice search.\n\nSeveral new integrations hit Google's voice search system for Android devices on Thursday, which lets people conduct queries orally by first saying, \"OK Google.\" In addition to Zillow, Shazam, NPR and online radio service TuneIn have been integrated.\n\nThe integrations require users to have those other apps on their smartphone or tablet. But instead of having to open the apps individually, users can ask their mobile device directly, which, hopefully, will then take them inside the appropriate app with an answer.\n\nThe Zillow integration will work for local searches as well as housing searches in other cities. Users, for instance, can search for homes for sale, for rent, or for open houses. \"Show apartments for rent in Boston on Zillow,\" you could say.\n\nWith TuneIn, users can say, \"Open TuneIn in car mode.\" That would be helpful for hands-free driving.\n\nThrough the Shazam integration, people can ask their smartphone what song is playing around them, by saying, \"OK Google, Shazam this song.\" (Google voice search already lets people identify songs without Shazam.)\n\nSince Google opened outside support for its OK Google voice search in 2014, developers of many other third party apps have integrated their apps into the system. There's also tons of useful commands that can be conducted using Google's own smarts.\n\nIts functionalities extend beyond search. The \"OK Google\" command is also now a key element in how people interact with smartwatches running Google's Android Wear operating system.", "A trio of social media stocks is getting pummeled this week, a sign that Wall Street may be unwilling to overlook missteps at some of its Internet darlings.\n\nLinkedIn on Thursday plunged as much as 25 percent in after-hours trading after the professional social networking company forecast second-quarter sales that were weaker than Wall Street estimates.\n\nThe drop followed the declines of two other social networking companies. Twitter shares are down around 25 percent this week after the company reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations, while local reviews site Yelp plummeted 23 percent on Thursday, a day after it too posted sales that disappointed Wall Street.\n\nThe performances illustrate the way investors are questioning whether social media companies can keep their growth rates vigorous enough to justify their valuations. The stocks of all three companies had traded at relatively high levels, reflecting Wall Street's giddy projections. Yet all three shattered that perception in their own way. And while many of these stocks are often volatile, with investors on edge about the weak economy, interest rates and other issues, shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep.\n\n\"Based on where some of these stocks were trading, expectations were already very high and were priced for relative perfection,\" said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. \"The reaction when companies don't achieve great results can be fairly severe.\"\n\nAny continued rockiness in the stocks could cause repercussions. Last year, several technology companies -- including the online storage firm Box -- delayed their initial public offerings because of turbulence in tech stocks. A protracted swoon in public tech companies could also trickle into their privately held counterparts. These companies have been frothy lately, with start-ups daily hitting $1 billion-plus valuations and renewing talk of a bubble in Silicon Valley.\n\nWall Street analysts are already reassessing their financial forecasts of some of the social media companies. In the last few days, several analysts who track Yelp and Twitter have lowered their expectations of the financial and stock performance of the companies.\n\nNot all social media stocks are getting swept up in the maelstrom. Facebook, which posted quarterly results last week, also reported sales that were lighter than Wall Street expected. Yet its stock withstood the headwinds, as Facebook continues to pull away from competitors by adding users to its main social networking site, as well as its Instagram photo-sharing app and WhatsApp messaging service. The company also is making money off newer lines of business, like video advertising.\n\n\"With some of the larger platform companies like Facebook and Google, valuation isn't based so much on stretched growth targets,\" Mr. Sebastian said.\n\nUnlike many other social media companies, LinkedIn doesn't depend on online advertising for its performance. On Thursday, the company posted a 35 percent jump in sales for the first quarter, exceeding estimates, with growth from services it sells to recruiters and premium subscriptions.\n\nBut LinkedIn warned that profits for the rest of the year would be hurt by the strong dollar, weak ad sales in Europe and a transition with assigning new accounts in its sales force. In addition, the company has increased research spending, and is grappling with the impact of its $1.5 billion deal to purchase Lynda.com, a video-based education site, its biggest acquisition ever.\n\nSome of these \"investments required operational transitions that will be impacting our results through the middle of this year, but that we anticipate will position us well for 2016 and beyond,\" said Jeffrey Weiner, LinkedIn's chief executive, in a conference call, where he pointed particularly to the sales force and spending on research and development.\n\nYelp, which collects user reviews about restaurants and other local services, reported late Wednesday that its ad sales and user growth decelerated during the first quarter. The results suggested that it will be more challenging than expected to make money from the millions of people who check its free listings.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's chief executive, said the company was continuing to \"seek ways to increase engagement and drive awareness\" and was confident there remained a \"large local advertising market opportunity.\"\n\nTwitter has had particular difficulty in the last few months persuading marketers to buy ads designed to prompt the viewer to take an action, like downloading an app or buying a product. The company's inconsistent performance has intensified scrutiny of Dick Costolo, the chief executive, who has vowed to speed up product releases to attract new users and advertisers to Twitter.\n\nRobert S. Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said in an e-mail that the stock declines this week were company-specific, rather than a reflection of broader investor dissatisfaction with social networking or technology. Amazon.com soared last week after the company disclosed just how powerful a business its cloud computing arm had become.\n\nStill, that's little comfort for the web companies that are taking a beating in the stock market now.\n\nReferring to Yelp, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note earlier this week that \"we upgraded shares almost a year ago.\"\n\n\"Our call hasn't worked,\" he said. \"And we don't have confidence that it will from here either.\"", "While many of us tap out these symbols to our family and friends, there are no universal usage rules for emoji: no grammar, no meanings. No syntax.\n\nBut Fred Benenson, the visionary who gave the world Emoji Dick (Moby Dick translated into Japanese emoji), is trying to change all that. In fact, Fred Benenson is trying to turn emoji into a bona fide language.\n\n\"Emoji are now an essential component of how we're talking to each other,\" Benenson said. \"And experimenting with them gets us to a better understanding of what they actually mean to us and how we can use them.\"\n\nOn Kickstarter, the platform where Benenson first launched his \"Moby Dick\" translation -- and where he now works, as the site's data lead -- the unlikely linguistic visionary is raising funds for an online tool that could translate even complex English sentences into emoji.\n\nUnlike other efforts in this vein, Benenson's \"Emoji Translation Project\" won't just match keywords to their equivalent symbols and sub the symbols in. Instead, it will work much like Google's high-powered translation engine: first gathering texts in English and emoji, produced by human translators; then running those texts through a machine-learning algorithm, which searches the two data sets for patterns; then waiting and watching as the algorithm spits out a synthesized, codified grammar.\n\nOr ... not.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,\" said Arika Okrent, a linguist and author of the 2009 book In the Land of Invented Languages. \"Emoji are fun. I like emoji. But they're not a language -- they're a game of charades.\"\n\nOkrent, it's worth noting, is not someone you'd expect to be skeptical about made-up tongues: She actually speaks Klingon.\n\nBut Klingon -- the fictional language of an alien warrior species, for the non-Trekkies in the audience -- was set down with both rules and a writing system from its beginning. Emoji, Okrent says, are fundamentally different: Even as people begin using them to express complex ideas or full sentences, they're using them in arbitrary, individual ways. We haven't agreed on the meaning for the \"prayer hands\" emoji -- forget the intricacies of expressing abstract thoughts or the present perfect tense.\n\nThat variance, Okrent says, will make machine learning impossible. (\"In order for the algorithm to discover a pattern, there has to be a pattern to discover,\" she explains.)\n\nAnd that's not the only obstacle Benenson and his vision face: There are literally no other image-based languages.\n\nThe last real push to invent one ended semi-tragically. A concentration camp survivor named Charles Bliss attempted to launch a universal, pictorial language, called Blissymbolics, because he believed it would decrease intercultural misunderstandings. Blissymbolics' basic pictures are, indeed, pretty easy to figure out, which has made them popular among a small set of language therapists. But as you try to express more complex ideas, the language gets less intuitive and more confusing. Ultimately, it never caught on -- a great disappointment to Bliss.\n\nOf course, there's a momentum around emoji that there never was around Blissymbolics. An emoji -- the humble -- was named 2014's \"word\" of the year. Instagram recently enabled emoji hashtags, a nod to some kind of mainstream desire to use the symbols instead of words.\n\nAccording to Emojitracker, a tool the logs each emoji tweeted out on Twitter, emoji use has risen more than 50 per cent since December 2013, from roughly 11 million tweeted emoji per day to almost 17 million now.\n\n\"I think as we use them more and more, a certain emoji lingua will emerge,\" Benenson said, \"and that's what we're interested in capturing with this project.\"\n\nBenenson isn't naive to the challenges of the project: He knows he'll need a huge team of English-to-emoji translators to get enough material to run past an algorithm. (Currently, he's fundraising $15,000 to pay these translators: at 5 cents a translation, that's enough for roughly 300,000 lines of text.) Even then, he admits, the translator might not work: There will be words or sentences it gets wrong. There will be gobbledygook.\n\nStill, if Emoji Dick taught Benenson anything, it's that there's value in probing emoji and their cultural applications. That project was met with derision when he launched it in 2009; six years later, the Library of Congress has a copy -- and emoji translations of half a dozen other books are now available online.\n\nBenenson thinks his Emoji Translator could be put to similar use, translating books or other texts. He also envisions an application programming interface that would let other websites and apps integrate emoji translation.\n\nIf nothing else, he said, \"we have faith that the results will be at least funny.\"\n\nIt's not a linguistic revolution -- but it is something.", "There's an online travel booking war brewing in Seattle, but Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said his team \"understands the task at hand\" and is ready to fight.\n\nGoogle, which has a large - and possibly growing- Seattle-area presence, has been tiptoeing into the travel space for years and Amazon officially took the plunge earlier this month. Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) is moving its headquarters from Bellevue to Seattle's Interbay neighborhood, which will put it right in Amazon's (Nasdaq: AMZN) backyard as the two companies prepare to go toe-to-toe.\n\nKhosrowshahi told investors during Expedia's quarterly earnings call on Thursday \"you would be stupid not to worry about\" the new competition, but there's still plenty of room for Expedia. The Bellevue company has exclusively been in the online travel industry since it spun out of Microsoft in 1996.\n\nThe company posted a profit of $44.1 million for the first quarter of 2015 on revenue of $1.37 billion. That had investors happy and the stock price popped up 4.5 percent to around $98 per share in after hours trading. But Expedia's margins keep getting slimmer.\n\nExpedia employs about 3,000 people in Bellevue, and is expanding as it prepares to move to Interbay. By the time the company moves into the former Amgen campus on Seattle's waterfront, it will have as many as 4,500 employees.\n\nThe company's bread and butter is hotel bookings. While the number of bookings has increased each year, but revenue from each of those had declined for each of the past 14 quarters.\n\nSo far in 2015, room night revenue is down 13.6 percent compared to last year.\n\nJacob Demmitt covers technology companies for the Puget Sound Business Journal.", "For anyone who can't get enough Android in their life, the Android TV-powered Nexus Player makes a great option to streaming devices like Apple TV or Roku.

Why? Because stepping into the ring with the entire Swiss watch industry in the \"fight for the wrist\" is the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world: Apple. Everyone from brand CEOs to Basel taxi drivers had an opinion on the Apple Watch, and how much impact it will or won't have on the world of Swiss watchmaking.\n\nOn the whole the industry is putting on a good game face, with many veterans who cut their teeth on the \"quartz crisis\" of the 80s -- when cheaper and more accurate Seiko quartz watches decimated the Swiss industry -- claiming to be unfazed.\n\nSome, such as Breitling vice-president Jean-Paul Giardin, think the competition will actually offset other challenges to luxury watches, including a cooling Chinese market and an uncertain European economy: \"The 'fight for the wrist' is actually a fight to have anything at all on the wrist. If people continue to wear things on their wrists then traditional watches will survive.\"\n\nMany variations on the \"smartwatch\" theme were being touted at Baselworld. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant announced its MotionX powered self-quantification platform weeks before the fair. This is essentially a quartz watch with luxury looks and \"Fitbit\" type module inside. TAG Heuer, lacking an actual product, announced a formidable partnership with Google and Intel. Breitling's on-brand B55 allows wearers to control their chronograph functions through a smartphone app and interface.\n\nBut it was Bulgari that delivered the sneakiest blow: an intelligent concept watch that avoids gimmickry, short battery life and technological obsolescence. The Bulgari Diagono Magnesium offers unique functionality in an equally unique looking package, while maintaining the mechanical engine that luxury lovers like so much.\n\nBulgari has teamed up with Swiss data storage and security company WISeKey for its connected device. Embedded in the otherwise 100 per cent mechanical watch is a Near Field Communication chip and antenna that acts as a key for the Bulgari Vault, which could store your passwords or unlock your home. Batteries are not included because they're not required. This sidesteps a major hurdle for competitors, Apple Watch included.\n\nThe watch is just as futuristic as the technology inside it. While it's powered by a conventional automatic movement, the case is made from a hybrid of magnesium, steel, ceramic and hi-tech polymer, and coated with motorlac, a lacquer found in F1 engines. It's exactly the sort of bold design you'd expect from Bulgari, which hopes to have the watch in stores before Basel next year. POA.\n\nVery few watch brands can truly claim the coveted status of being a \"manufacture\", which can produce a complete watch, including the highly precise escapement (consisting of balance wheel, balance spring, escape wheel and pallet, the true beating heart of a mechanical watch) without using external parts suppliers. The number of brands that have achieved this outside Switzerland is smaller still. Nomos Glash\u00fctte is a member of this elite group. And somehow it is the only one to routinely offer this level of watchmaking at an accessible price.\n\nLast year the small German brand made waves when it announced its in-house \"Swing System\" escapement -- the result of an investment of \u20ac12 million and years of research. It's a development that frees the brand from the supply shortages that plague the industry. And with 30 per cent growth last year it's an investment that's paying off.\n\nThis year Nomos has stepped up the pace, announcing a new, elegant calibre, the DUW3001, and a brand new model called \"Minimatik\" to house it in. The automatic, chronometer-grade movement comes in at only 3.2mm thick, allowing Nomos to produce the sort of slender timepieces that its pared-back aesthetic suits. With a 35.5mm case the Minimatik is aimed at ladies' wrists, though it would certainly suit those men who prefer a more classically sized timepiece, and the dial, while clean, is surprisingly colourful with ink-blue numerals, Bordeaux red hands and tiny gold hour markers.\n\nThe Minimatik, like all Nomos's watches, is breath of fresh air in the world of watches: it's a serious timepiece that doesn't take itself too seriously. RRP $5300.\n\nYou can tell a lot about a brand by their Baselworld booth. Romain Jerome's is all about fun: they had a popcorn machine, ball pit and watches in arcade-style skill tester machines. But that doesn't mean its watches are sideshow confection. Romain Jerome is famous for its bold statement watches, innovative movement architecture and \"retro-futuristic\" designs.Take the Steampunk Auto, a toned-down (!) version of the brand's earlier steampunk-infused models.

But two years ago, the situation started to change. Other phone companies like LG and HTC caught up to Samsung.\n\nLast year, however, the situation became drastic for Samsung as Apple came out with an iPhone with a large screen. The Galaxy S6 (and the Galaxy S6 Edge) is Samsung's answer to the mighty iPhone. And it is a damn good answer.\n\nJust as Apple moved out of its comfort zone and decided to put a bigger screen in the iPhone to make it remarkably good, with Galaxy S6, Samsung has moved away from using plastic bodies for its phone.\n\nWhile it looks good, the design of the S6 is still not all that original. The rounded corners of the metal frame and the speaker grill seem to be inspired by the design of the iPhone 6.\n\nBut the overall effect is pleasing to the eye. The glass back cover and the metal alloy frame make for a nice combination, although the phone is a little slippery to hold.\n\nThe phone is very slim with a thickness of just 6.9mm, and is astoundingly light at 138 grams despite packing in a 5.1-inch screen. This makes carrying it in the hand or putting it in one's pocket very easy, which is a welcome change compared to much bigger phones in the market like the Moto X.\n\nWhat makes the S6 really good is its core hardware. The screen has a resolution of 1440 X 2560 pixels, making it extremely sharp. This means text and images look super sharp and clear on the screen of the S6. The screen is also extremely bright and shows vivid colours.\n\nOther components are equally good. The octa-core processor in the phone is fast. Unlike many other phones that use Qualcomm processors, the new Galaxy is using Samsung's own Exynos chip.\n\nWhether a user is playing a demanding game or editing a photo with Instagram, the phone doesn't feel slow.\n\nIt also helps that the phone has 3GB RAM and according to Samsung, a rather fast 32GB internal speed.\n\nThe 16-megapixel camera is one of the best ever put in a phone. It is so good that for the first time an Android phone rivals the camera performance of an iPhone 6. It clicks extremely detailed photos with excellent colours in good light. Even in low light the performance is very good due to the wide aperture (F1.9) of the camera.\n\nThe 5-megapixel front camera is also one of the best in its class, and comes with an ultrawide lens so that a user can fit more people into group selfies.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 has a number of unique features. It comes with a fingerprint sensor, which can be used to lock or unlock the phone. Unlike the scanner in the Galaxy S5, this one works in a much better way. Then, there is the heart rate sensor at the back. This is hit-and-miss, so it's more of a gimmick.\n\nThe phone is powered by Android Lollipop. But Samsung has customised it with its own user interface called Touchwiz. This is the only weak point of the Galaxy S6. While TouchWiz and Android are versatile and full of unique features, the iOS that powers the iPhone or even Sense, which is inside HTC phones, is more streamlined.\n\nBattery life is also could have been better. The phone lasts around 12 to 13 hours - good enough for a single day of use - but falls short of what some other Android phones can manage.\n\nBut overall, the S6 is one hell of a phone. With it, Samsung has finally created a phone that can not only match but in some cases surpasses the iPhone 6. The fact that it does so at a price of Rs 49,900, lower than the price of the iPhone 6, is even more impressive.\n\nMisplaced your phone? Do a Google search\n\nIf you have an Android phone and if you can't remember where you put it just moments ago, whether on the dining table or under a pillow on the sofa, stop the frantic search. Instead, do a Google search for it.\n\nLast week Google came out with a feature that helps you locate your misplaced or lost phone. To locate your phone, all you have to do is put \"Find my phone\" in the Google search. The website then looks for the location of your phone and then displays it in a map.\n\nOn the same web page, you also get an option to \"ring\" your phone. Once you click on that, your phone will ring for five minutes at full volume so that you can locate the sound and find it. The phone rings even if it is the silent mode.\n\nNow of course, there are a certain requirements for this feature. First of all, you can find your phone only if you are logged into Google using the same email/Google ID that you use on your phone. It also requires that your phone has the location services on, has the latest version of the Google services installed, and has the Android 4 or newer version running on it.\n\nOn your phone, you can turn on the location services from settings.

Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high-speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build the $68-billion high-speed rail line in California.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\nAbe met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors.\n\nAbe's itinerary also included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\nSilicon Valley tech firms have helped drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe attended a White House dinner.

If so, they were mistaken.\n\nHouse reps on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee tore into the Feds' demands for skeleton keys to decrypt citizens' private files.\n\nThe panel met on Wednesday to question law enforcement and technology experts about the FBI's proposals for backdoors in encryption. Cryptographers say it is impossible to build secure encryption systems that only allow Uncle Sam in and keep hackers out.\n\nUnusually, the committee has not one but two members who actually know something about technology. Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is one of only four US congressfolk who holds a computer science degree, and Representative Will Hurd (R-TX) is a former CIA agent who ran a cybersecurity company before being elected.\n\nBoth congressmen listened as Daniel Conley, district attorney of Massachusetts, called on Congress to ban Apple and Google's on-by-default file encryption in cellphones. Conley said the technology was aiding child pornographers, terrorists and, rather bizarrely, people who take upskirt photos of women on public transport.\n\n\"In America, we often say that none of us is above the law,\" Conley said [transcript PDF]. \"But when unaccountable corporate interests place crucial evidence beyond the legitimate reach of our courts, they are in fact placing those who rape, defraud, assault and even kill in a position of profound advantage over victims and society.\"\n\nHis colleague Amy Hess, executive assistant director of the FBI's science and technology branch, claimed [transcript PDF] that rapists, child abusers, and terrorists, were piling into encryption. Agents' monitoring was \"going dark\" thanks to encryption, she added. Hess wants backdoors added to security software source code to allow access to data on demand - with a warrant, of course.\n\nYoutube video\n\nThese demands cut little ice with the committee, which roasted both speakers over the technical impossibility of their plans, and had some choice words about the practices used by law enforcement to surveil and track suspects.\n\n\"Why do you think Apple and Google are doing this? It's because the public is demanding it. A public does not want an out-of-control surveillance state,\" Lieu said.\n\n\"Apple and Google don't have coercive power. District attorneys do, the FBI does, the NSA does, and to me it's very simple to draw a privacy balance when it comes to law enforcement and privacy: just follow the damn Constitution. And because the NSA didn't do that and other law enforcement agencies didn't do that, you're seeing a vast public reaction to this.\"\n\nHurd said that there were already hacking tools that could be used by agents that worked, recounting how when he was a network penetration tester for banks he would always offer to either charge a fee, or be allowed to keep what he could steal. No one took the second option because he always got in.\n\nHe said the FBI and cops should be held to a higher standard when it came to civil liberties. He promised the committee would be watching the FBI's proposals \"very carefully\" to make sure privacy isn't trampled underfoot.\n\nHis colleague Representative Blake Farenthold (R-TX) also took the chance to put the boot in. He asked the panel of experts if anyone knew of a \"gold standard\" encryption system that could be backdoored - no one raised their hands.\n\nWhile the bulk of the session covered encryption, Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) asked Hess point blank if it is possible for the FBI to track people's location using their cellphones without a warrant. After offering to brief him privately on the matter twice, she admitted that yes, it is possible.\n\nAll in all it was a chastening and somewhat sore session for the Feds. It's also clear that, with elections not too far off, Congress seems to be understanding that the voting public is peeved at privacy invasions by the state. \u00ae", "Russ & Rebel Leathers is closing its doors after 30 years in Latham, New York, as changing tastes in clothing and the rise of online retailing cut sales by more than half over the past decade.\n\nOwner Russ Principe said leather coats, pants, vests and other mainstays of his business at 922 Troy-Schenectady Road largely fell out of fashion in the early 2000s other than with his core group of customers -- motorcycle riders.\n\nPrincipe also didn't adapt when many retailers started selling their products online. Even though he has a website, he can't afford to pay for search engine optimization so his business would show up near the top when people type \"leather coats\" into Google.\n\n\"It's become a whole other business,\" said Principe, 55.\n\nPeak sales were in 2001: about $800,000 at the main store and about $100,000 at another store he used to run at Colonie Center. He closed the mall location a few years later.\n\nPrincipe started carrying another line of merchandise when leather sales started falling -- clothes for strippers and exotic dancers -- but there isn't demand for that alone to carry the business.\n\nWere it not for New York's high taxes, Principe said he might have been able to keep the doors open.\n\n\"I vent to everyone who comes in,\" he said. \"Over 90 percent of the people say they want to leave the state.

But Israel is still not a signatory.\n\nMoreover, Israel reportedly has at least 200 active nuclear weapons at a remote spot called Dimona, and this undoubtedly is the backdrop for the current hubbub.\n\nPerhaps a nuclear-free zone in the entire Middle East could indeed offer a mutually satisfactory solution and create a more sustainable nuclear accord for all the parties involved.\n\nNepal suffered a disastrous earthquake last month. As usual, the small democratic state of Israel was one of the first to supply significant aid and material to a nation in need.\n\nWhere is the aid from the wealthy Middle East states that demonize Israel?\n\nAs a non-Roman Catholic, my point of view may not count for much among the faithful people who were shepherded by Bishop Robert Finn, but the church does not exist in a vacuum.\n\nBishop Finn has been described as a holy man, and although many of his flock are disappointed by his resignation, he has no one but himself to blame.\n\nI do not understand how one man, no matter how holy he may be, can set himself up as judge, jury and decider and expect the flock to follow him. The modern Roman Catholic has not surrendered his conscience and must exercise judgment in matters of faith and morality.\n\nToday's world is much more complex than when we were hopeful to live peacefully and have enough to feed our family. At the risk of misquoting Karen Armstrong, the power of religion is not about the powerful.\n\nBefore Bishop Finn arrived on the scene, there was a spirit of ecumenical cooperation in the city, and this was lost right after his arrival. When one man sets himself up as the sole arbiter of all things spiritual, he is at risk of losing his way.\n\nOne day while I was working in my church's food pantry, a woman asked whether we had any burn ointment. We didn't.\n\nShe then showed me the dressing on a burn on her abdomen that was soaked with drainage. She said that she couldn't afford to see a doctor because she had no health insurance.\n\nSuch is the plight of more than 300,000 Missourians trapped in the Medicaid gap.\n\nThis must be changed. Are our legislators working for our people of Missouri, or for the misery of our people?\n\nI recently found the column on your website, \"Leftward-tilting letters to the editor\" from earlier this month. To find it, just Google the words in the quotes above.\n\nIn this column, the public editor answers the question, \"Why are there more letters to the editor from people on the left?\"\n\nBriefly, the answer was that \"the department gets more letters from liberals -- period.\" He also offers advice to conservatives on how to write acceptable letters.\n\n\u25aa Enact an outreach program to get more conservatives to participate.\n\n\u25aa Institute a training program for conservatives to write better and more letters. Let's call it ConRite. Of course, this should be federally funded.\n\n\u25aa Quotas should immediately be enacted to ensure equality of opinions.\n\n\u25aa Government regulators are needed, some in the newsrooms. Let's call this new department the Letter Protection Agency, or LPA.\n\n\u25aa A Letter to the Editor Fairness Doctrine should be passed by Congress to lock up those who do not comply to these new regulations.\n\nDon't like these ideas? Isn't this the way liberals normally handle these problems?\n\nThe Republicans need to understand that because of their hatred for the president, they are implementing protocols and tactics that set precedents that will affect governance of this country no matter who is in the White House or who has the majority in Congress.\n\nThe example of obstructionist methods they used are already being turned around to make minority leaders Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi far more powerful than they would have been otherwise.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner's invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sets the precedent of allowing foreign heads of state to make campaign speeches before Congress for the purpose of influencing not only elections in their homelands but also to influence U.S. policy.\n\nFinally, the seditious letter of 47 senators to Iran may very well cause irreparable damage to the constitutionally obligated ability of now and future presidents to negotiate agreements and treaties with foreign entities.\n\nThe GOP along with all of us may find the ramifications of their actions hard to deal with and difficult to correct.\n\nLast month, I rode with a Bike for Peace delegation from Washington, D.C., to New York City for the opening of the United Nations' Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In cities along the way, we met with students and mayors stressing the need to get rid of nuclear weapons before weapons get rid of us.\n\nWe also explained that a new nuclear arms race is starting. The U.S. plans on spending $1 trillion over the next 30 years to modernize all nuclear weapons and build new nuclear weapons factories, at almost twice the rate of Cold War spending.\n\nModernization usually means something positive and benign, but new \"smart\" nuclear weapons -- smaller, more accurate, with new capabilities -- are being proposed and so are more likely to be used. These weapons will last 75 years, while the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty says we are to get rid of them.\n\nPresident Barack Obama should take action now to reduce nuclear dangers by deciding that the current U.S. nuclear arsenal is modern enough and that there is no need to spend additional billions of dollars to replace every part of it -- or any part of it.\n\nGov. Sam Brownback and Kansas Legislature: The U.S. and state constitutions do not mandate ignorance. What's next? Issuing guns?\n\nThe Elk River Wind Farm, a 150-megawatt facility on the Ferrell Ranch, produces enough energy to power upward of 60,000 residences.\n\nConstruction of the wind farm brought up to 200 jobs with eight full-time, permanent positions in the community. Additionally, the pilot agreement provides a total payment of $2.25 million ($150,000 per year) to Butler County in the first 15 years of the project's term.\n\nThe wind industry provides economic benefits for Kansas, creating thousands of jobs with billions of dollars invested in our economy.\n\nFor ranchers and farmers, wind provides a steady income in times of economic insecurity. The landowner payments I receive from the Elk River Wind farm have helped me to survive the prolonged drought of recent years.\n\nKansas has the second-best wind potential in the United States. We should use this resource to grow rural economies and support agricultural producers.\n\nThe highly successful Renewable Portfolio Standards have attracted business development. Analysts estimate he wind industry in Kansas has the potential to be a $100 billion business.\n\nThe Renewable Portfolio Standards don't cost taxpayers anything. Why the Legislature would even consider repealing such an effective business-development policy is beyond me.\n\nThe Renewable Portfolio Standards are good for Kansas.

Those figures were broadly in line with the trio's spending in previous filings recorded in January by researchers at anti-corruption group Transparency International -- the Commission itself does not provide comparative data with previous years.However, some of the other big spenders recorded sharp increases, including Google and Germany's Deutsche Bank, which doubled their expenditure, U.S. chemicals group Dow, which recorded four times the level of spending as its previous entry.None of the companies listed offered comment.Google, subject of a high-profile antitrust case launched by the Commission two weeks ago after a five-year investigation, spent 3.0-3.5 million euros ($3.4-3.9 million), the same as Dow . Microsoft, which has itself been fined heavily in the past by EU antitrust authorities, has been prominent among those pursuing complaints against its American rival Google.Two German companies were among those which spent 3 million euros or more last year. Deutsche Bank was the fourth biggest spender, reporting lobbying activity worth 3.96 million euros, and engineer Siemens spent 3.23 million.China's tech leader Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] reported spending of 3.0 million euros in 2014. That was the same as it had previously reported as spending in its 2012 fiscal year.DATA QUALITY IMPROVINGAlso reporting spending of 3.0 million was paij GmbH, a German company that sells a mobile payments app and which put itself on the Register for the first time in March. Officials at the company could not immediately be reached for comment.U.S. engineering firm General Electric reported lobby spending in the EU of 3.25-3.50 million euros for 2013. No 2014 data appeared on its page on the Transparency Register.Transparency International's Daniel Freund said some changes in data filed appeared to reflect a recognition among companies that the Register now set more rigorous reporting requirements. Over 1,000 organisations registered for the first time after Jan. 27, when it became a condition for access to officials.\"The data quality seems to be getting better,\" Freund said, while noting that the Register only went some way to clarifying how much effort was going in to lobbying in Brussels and saying that the Commission appeared to have so far put only limited staff resources into scrutiny of the accuracy of entries.Other organisations, including non-governmental pressure groups, must also declare spending. Environmental lobby Greenpeace, for example, declared 1.0-1.25 million euros in 2013.A second element of transparency introduced under European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker since he took office in November is a register of contacts by commissioners and senior staff with companies, lobby groups and their representatives.Transparency International research found U.S. firms Google, Microsoft and General Electric, as well as European planemaker Airbus, were among the most active in visiting top EU officials since such meetings first had to made public in December.

Many connect to ad-related sites and tracking sites while some connect to much more dubious sites that are associated with malware.\n\nBut here's the problem -- this activity often takes place without the owner being aware of what is going on. That's something that most smartphone users would be appalled to discover -- if only they were able to.\n\nToday, Luigi Vigneri and pals from Eurecom in France have a solution. These guys have come up with an automated way to check the apps in Google Play and monitor the sites they connect to. And their results reveal the extraordinary scale of secret connections that many apps make without their owners being any the wiser.\n\nVigneri and co began by downloading over 2,000 free apps from all 25 categories on the Google Play store. They then launched each app on a Samsung Galaxy SIII running Android version 4.1.2 that was set up to channel all traffic through the team's server. This recorded all the urls that each app attempted to contact.\n\nNext they compared the urls against a list of known ad-related sites from a database called EasyList and a database of user tracking sites called EasyPrivacy, both compiled for the open source AdBlock Plus project. Finally, they counted the number of matches on each list for every app\n\nThe results make for interesting reading. In total, the apps connect to a mind-boggling 250,000 different urls across almost 2,000 top level domains. And while most attempt to connect to just a handful of ad and tracking sites, some are much more prolific.\n\nVigneri and co give as an example \"Music Volume Eq,\" an app designed to control volume, a task that does not require a connection to any external urls. And yet the app makes many connections. \"We find the app Music Volume EQ connects to almost 2,000 distinct URLs,\" they say.\n\nAnd it is not alone in its excesses. The team say about 10 percent of the apps they tested connect to more than 500 different urls. And nine out of 10 of the most frequently contact ad-related domains are run by Google.\n\nThe user tracking sites that apps connect to are less pervasive. More than 70 percent of apps do not connect to any user tracking sites. But those that do can be extravagant, some connecting to more than 800 user tracking sites. What's more many of these are created by organizations that Google has designated with \"top developer status.\" The worst offender is an app called Eurosport Player which connects to 810 different user tracking sites.\n\nA small proportion of the apps even seem designed to connect to suspicious sites connected with malware.\n\nMost users of these apps will have little, if any, knowledge of this kind of behavior. So Vigneri and co have developed their own app that monitors the behavior of others on a user's smartphone and reveals exactly which external sites these apps are attempting to connect to.\n\nThey call their new app NoSuchApp or NSA for short \"in honor of a similarly acronymed monitoring agency.\"\n\nThat should give Android users confidence in the apps they use. \"With this application, our goal is to provide a mechanism for end users to be aware of the network activity of their installed Android applications,\" say Vigneri and co.\n\nThe team plan to make the app publicly available on Google Play in the near future.", "8 CONNECT 7 TWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nWhen a Silicon Valley tech executive resigned amid criticism of his donation to an anti-gay-marriage campaign, he became a high-profile example of the harassment people can face if their political donations aren't kept secret, supporters of anonymous \"dark money\" groups argued Tuesday at a Phoenix debate.\n\nMozilla CEO Brendan Eich stepped down last year after activists pressured the tech company over his support of Proposition 8, which sought in 2008 to ban gay marriages in California. The $1,000 contribution was listed in publicly filed campaign-finance reports along with hundreds of other donations.\n\nThe fallout shows why people should be allowed to give anonymously to political groups, said Kurt Altman, an attorney with the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.\n\n\"Anonymity protects everybody's participation,\" he said to a crowd of about 120 at Arizona State University's First Amendment Forum. \"In today's day and age, there's too much risk.\"\n\nAltman was one of four election attorneys who debated whether the Constitution protects private campaign donations as political free speech at an event sponsored by Goldwater.\n\nRELATED: Outside donors, 'dark money' influenced Ariz. races\n\nMost campaign donations, from local races to presidential campaigns, are required under campaign-finance laws to be reported publicly. But U.S. Supreme Court decisions in recent years have opened the door for corporations and labor unions to spend money in elections without revealing their donors through non-profit groups.\n\nThese groups, dubbed dark money by critics because of their secrecy, have exploded in number since 2010, spending hundreds of millions to influence races across the country.\n\nWhen a political donation becomes controversial, a CEO like Eich can make ends meet while searching for another job, Altman said. But other people don't have that luxury. When a low-level employee of a Catholic hospital is found to support a pro-abortion group, the consequences are worse, he said.\n\nToday's online records make donations far more accessible, said Allen Dickerson, legal director for the Center for Competitive Politics, a Virginia non-profit that advocates for political speech.\n\n\"In a world where this information is put online in very small dollar amounts, and it stays there permanently in a searchable format ... a lot of people might not be comfortable with that level of inquiry,\" Dickerson said. \"Any employer, any romantic interest, any friend, any business contact with Google can figure out who I supported.\"\n\nBut donation records have been online for years. And very few cases of harassment have been proven, said Dan Barr, a First Amendment expert at Perkins Coie law firm.\n\nEich may have lost his job, but it could have gone another way.\n\nWhen the owners of Chick-fil-A came out against gay marriage, some customers boycotted the fast-food restaurant. But counterprotesters held \"appreciation\" days, packing the business with lines out the door.\n\n\"I think they make a pretty good sandwich,\" Barr joked. \"And I choose to go there even though I'm one of the lawyers who helped establish same-sex marriage in this state.\"\n\nCorporations use dark-money organizations to participate in politics because they don't want to upset their customers, Barr said.\n\n\"I think that's outweighed by the public's right to know how these people are participating so they can make whatever judgments they want to make,\" he said.\n\nNot knowing who funds political groups makes it difficult for voters to understand the motivations behind the groups, said Tom Irvine, a campaign law expert who argued with Barr against dark money.\n\n\"We're the target of the millions of dollars spent, and we don't know where it's coming from,\" Irvine said.\n\nThe debate didn't sway everyone.\n\nGlenn Jackson, a Chandler resident who is self-employed, attended the debate to support anonymous political donations and left with the same convictions.\n\n\"I was incensed by the Mozilla CEO's resignation,\" Jackson said. \"People who take a controversial position should be able to do that and express their will privately.\"\n\nTOP 2014 INDIVIDUAL DONORS IN ARIZONA ELECTIONS\n\nHere are the top individual donors of the 2014 election cycle.

Bernie Sanders officially joined the 2016 race as Hillary Clinton's first Democratic challenger on Thursday. While widely considered a long shot, his top strategist says the campaign is already off to a \"remarkable start.\"\n\nJust how much does the general public know about him and what do their questions reveal about what they most want to know?\n\nA review of Google search data from the twenty-four hours after his official announcement Thursday unveils what was most asked about 2016's newest candidate.\n\n1. How old is Bernie Sanders?\n\nBernie Sanders is 73-years-old and was born on September 8, 1941. He is the oldest of the currently declared 2016 candidates.\n\nThe age question is not unique to Sanders. \"How old is ...\" was also the number one query on Google about both Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio. The same question ranked in the second and third slot for Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.\n\n2. Is Bernie Sanders Jewish?\n\nSanders is the son of a Polish-Jewish immigrant and while he was raised Jewish, he is not active in organized religion.\n\nOf the currently declared 2016 contenders, Sanders is the only one whose religion came up in the top five searched questions.\n\n3. Is Bernie Sanders a socialist?\n\nHe is a self-described \"Democratic Socialist.\" (One of President Obama's top laugh lines at this year's White House Correspondents' dinner poked fun at this, \"Apparently people really want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the White House. We could get a third Obama term after all.\")\n\n4. Is Bernie Sanders a Democrat?\n\nBernie Sanders is the longest-serving Independent in Congressional history, but is running on the Democratic ticket. His reason, \"I'm not a billionaire. To run outside of the two-party system would require enormous sums of money and a great expenditure of energy and time just to get on the ballot.\"\n\nSo how does this compare to the rest of the 2016 pack? The number one question searched on Rand Paul? His height - 5'8\". For Ted Cruz the top slot was asking where he was born - Calgary, Canada.", "We covered a lot of serious topics this week on Death and Taxes, from the early stirrings of the next presidential election to the riots in Baltimore sparked by the arrest-related death of Freddie Gray. As a result some of the users who found their way to us via keyword breadcrumb trails from Google, AOL, or Bing were searching for serious news.\n\nEven if they only had a rough grasp of the issues at least they were concerned.\n\nOther readers, however, clearly had both hands down the front of their sweatpants and were typing with their chins. There were those who are still hung up on everything about Michael Jackson but his music.\n\nAnd those who wanted only the freshest pictures of Lil Wayne.\n\nThen it got charmingly weird before degenerating completely.\n\nSometimes the search provider gave them away. You stay classy AOL.\n\nWhy can't you be more like your cousin Bing?\n\nWell at least they're interested in world history...\n\n\"Stand clear of the copulating straphangers, please.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether this user was worried about this phenomenon or looking for instructions.\n\nEither way the real questions come after you die.

With a dramatic shift in build material and quality, significant changes in hardware, and a far improved software experience, Samsung has finally delivered what many were looking for in the Galaxy S6.\n\nOf course, Samsung is known for pushing its boundaries, and this came in the form of the Galaxy S6 Edge, bringing forward a concept seen last year in the Galaxy Note Edge, and introducing it to the mainstream. With the release of two worthy flagship smartphones from the company, the obvious question that will be on your mind is with regards to which one is better suited to you. That is what we attempt to answer, as we take an in-depth look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 Edge!\n\nOn the design front, there is basically just one differentiating factor between these two devices, namely the curves on either side of the screen in the case of the Galaxy S6 Edge. Both devices do retain the tried and true design language of previous Samsung devices though, complete with the same tactile home button up front and standard placements for the volume rocker and power button.\n\nThe similarities continue on the back, as both devices sport a protruding camera module that is accompanied by a heart rate monitor. Both devices also have glass back panels, which eliminates the ability to remove the back cover and additional hardware features that they entailed. The Galaxy S6 is a tad taller and only a few grams heavier that the Edge variant, a difference that is largely negligible.\n\nWhen it comes to design, what makes the case for the Galaxy S6 Edge is indeed its slopes on the right and left portions of the screen, a significant difference that might have to felt to be believed. The inclusion of two edges started to make sense after holding the device. The fact that they come down to meet the palm allows for a side to side handling experience that is perhaps better than what you would get with the slab form factor of almost every other smartphone out there.\n\nGrip and accidentally turning on the display are mild concerns when it comes to the Edge variant. But when holding on to the phone, a very prominent lip is present in the metal frame that tilts down very slightly, and mainly sticks out from behind the screen. So with a good pinch, there aren't a lot of problems with keeping the phone in check without triggering the screen accidentally. However, the same cannot be said when holding the phone in the landscape orientation, as I did find it a little tough to hold the device on the edges without some fidgeting.\n\nThe width of the devices is pretty much the same, but with the screen coming down on either end, the Galaxy S6 Edge actually feels more narrow, and that makes a lot of difference. Aesthetically as well, the S6 Edge is the one that will definitely turn heads. While the original looks like a mashup of the Galaxy and Xperia lines due to its dual glass panels, the Edge version will be instantly recognizable to the tech-savvy, and given Samsung's big marketing push, likely to the common consumer soon enough. If handling is a big deal to you, the S6 Edge offers an experience that has to be felt, and its uniqueness is something that will certainly stay with you.\n\nThe sentiments on the design side of things hold true when it comes to the display, with the curves of the Galaxy S6 adding to the overall viewing experience as well. First, on the specifications front, both devices offer nothing short of what you would expect from a Samsung flagship, with their 5.1-inch Super AMOLED screens featuring a Quad HD resolution, resulting in the super high pixel density of 577 ppi. Both displays are vivid, colorful, and sharp, and don't miss a beat in work, play, or media consumption.\n\nWhat makes the Galaxy S6 Edge so compelling is the fact that its screen is essentially one entity, and doesn't have a specific area sectioned off for the edge capabilities, as was the case with the Galaxy Note Edge. We will explore the features of the edge in the software section below, but worth a mention is that they only take up one side of the display, and further, only appear when specifically triggered. It does feel like Samsung has finally figured out that the edges aren't made for supposedly game changing features, but rather to offer literally a new way of looking at a device.\n\nAs such, elements of the Android 5.0 Lollipop Material Design are also given an auxiliary benefit, with a roll-in effect of various UI elements that may not always be noticed, but are certainly appreciated every time it is. As an example, watching media in the landscape orientation makes the heads up notifications look even better because of this effect. The edges don't move any of the frame away from your viewpoint, and once again, are mostly there more for aesthetics and convenience, with a few features that for the most part, stay out of the way.\n\nAnother big change with their latest flagships was Samsung's decision to give the Snapdragons of the world a skip in favor of its in-house Exynos processor, something that looks to have worked to great effect. Under the hood, both phones pack the octa-core Exynos 7420 processor, backed by the Mali-T760 MP8 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. It is also worth mentioning that the built-in storage benefits from a UFS 2.0 flash memory construction that helps keep things super speedy and optimized, a case that has been made against expandable storage, that just won't be able to keep with installed memory. It's also packing LPDDR4 RAM, which represents a huge leap forward in memory performance for mobile devices\n\nBoth these devices race through the elements of the dialed-back TouchWiz interface, with virtually every stutter and hiccup from the past now eliminated. The only real stutter that we've ever seen involves the Flipboard-powered Briefing screen, which has to refresh every time you swipe to it, slowing down an immediate return to the homescreens as a result.\n\nAll other tasks are handled extremely well, even if you're trying to perform them at the same time using Multi-Window or the S Window capabilities. Almost no problems were seen with gaming as well, though the phone does get quite warm, but not uncomfortably so, while running the more processor intensive applications. The edge screen panels don't down the Galaxy S6 Edge either, so its speed doesn't get hindered because of its slightly higher feature set. As such, performance is one aspect where things are very much a tie, and is a non-factor for anyone confused between these two devices.\n\nThe big story since the announcement of these devices has been the lack of replaceable batteries and expandable storage, that have been otherwise staple features of the Samsung line. These phones do pack more than most when it comes to hardware though, including a better implementation of the fingerprint scanner embedded into the home button, and the now vertical heart rate monitor that, in our testing, worked a little faster than previous editions found on Samsung devices.\n\nConnectivity with the LTE networks has been very steady on either device, and the quality of voice calls are as good as they've ever been. The sound coming from the speaker in its new position at the bottom gets adequately loud, no matter which iteration of the phone you get.\n\nBattery life on either device is pretty standard, despite the higher resolution displays. Of course, we come back again to the primary difference between the two smartphones, the edges. There are no real hardware capabilities that put the edge over the top in this regard, though the different form factor does mean different third party accessories.\n\nAs you may have seen, or can check out below, in the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge camera shootout, it has to be said the camera package Samsung has put out this year is definitely among the best. A rear-facing 16 MP camera with a f/1.9 aperture adds auto-HDR to a laundry list of capabilities, with the front-facing 5 MP unit sporting the same as well.\n\nThe camera application comes with a variety of modes, including panorama and slow motion video capture at 120 fps, and can easily be activated by a double tap of the home button, which is one of the best felt enhancements with the latest Galaxy offerings.\n\nUsing these cameras in all but the lowest light in indoor situations yields some really great looking photos, and with an auto mode that performs extremely well, most of the guesswork is taken out of the smartphone photography experience. Extra features, and a manual Pro mode, are available to those who want it, but for the general user who just wants to capture memories, both of these devices are great companions to have.\n\nTo some extent, smartphone cameras were struggling to get to the point of replacing even typical point and shoot devices, but things are closer than they've ever been with the current crop of flagship smartphones, and the possibilities offered by the latest additions to the Galaxy S line are prime examples of that evolution.\n\nAs has been mentioned a few times already, the latest iteration of the TouchWiz software experience available with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge has been toned down considerably, to the pleasure of many. Not only has a lot of gimmicky aspects been put aside, but those that are still available aren't very prominent in their presence. Even the pop-up tutorials about how to use the different features are largely absent, and turning off features like S Voice is very easy to do this time around. The user interface still features a pretty colorful aesthetic, but the available theme engine can be used to change the look to anything that better suits your tastes.\n\nWith the software experience also mostly the same between both devices, it's better to take a look at what makes the Galaxy S6 Edge different, and what features and capabilities the edge panels offer. First, these panels and features don't show up until triggered, which happens only from a standby position via a few swipes on the side that are pre-determined by the user.\n\nThe night clock comes up, and then you can swipe from the bottom portion to see notifications, news tickers, and a number of other edge panels that can be installed from the Settings menu. Despite some usefulness to the news tickers, the scrolling generally focuses on one story at a time, and thus pales in comparison to using even the Briefing screen instead. It can also be a good way of looking at notifications quickly, but waking the phone up and seeing them on the lockscreen is arguably still faster.\n\nFinally, there is the People Edge, which houses five of your favorite contacts with specific colors assigned to them for easy access to calls and messages. While its functionality as a speed dial was great, the main gripe I had with it was the messages required the use of the native messaging app, instead of something else that you may already be comfortable with using, such as Hangouts. While the phone is upside down, the color assigned to the contact will glow on the side to let you know exactly who is calling in a very interesting way. That said, there aren't a lot of situations where you will have your phone screen placed down on a table, and it honestly does look like the underside of an import tuner car.\n\nOverall, the main takeaway from the software side of things is how much better the Samsung TouchWiz UI has gotten, helped by how optimized it is with the company's own processing packages. The edge features are there for those who specifically need them, but all said and done, there might not be a whole lot of people who do.\n\nWhen it comes to comparing the price points is when you realize that wanting the sloped edges requires a premium over the already not particularly cheap Galaxy S6. The Galaxy S6 Edge costs about $150 more overall for the unlocked version, and will result in higher monthly payments on various network carriers. For example, The S6 Edge will cost $10 per month on the Simple Choice monthly plan from T-Mobile.", "While there are many symptoms of Parkinson's disease -- slow motor skills, mumbling, and difficulty making facial expressions -- the most recognizable symptom is physical tremors. Aside from making micro movements difficult to perform -- tying shoelaces, for instance -- the tremors make it difficult to hold a pen and physically write. Design group Dopa Solutions created a dope solution to this problem: a pen that vibrates in order to make writing easier.\n\nThe handwriting disorder that afflicts Parkinson's victims, micrographia, causes handwriting to be both cramped and small, making it difficult to read. The writing tool, dubbed the ARC pen, uses high-frequency vibrations to stimulate the muscles in a sufferer's hand to expand the handwriting and make it more spacious. Dopa Solutions has not yet published official results, but the researchers have stated that out of 14 patients tested, 12 of them (around 86%) were able to write more legibly thanks to the pen.\n\nAside from the tremors making writing illegible, it's also difficult for sufferers to grasp a writing implement, as pens and pencils are not only thin, but aren't ergonomically designed for Parkinson's. The ARC pen aims to tackle this problem as well. It's not only thick enough to grasp with a looser grip, but shaped in a way that aids both grip and movement.\n\nParkinson's doesn't yet have a cure, but technology is helping to ease both the symptoms and the everyday tasks that the disease has made difficult. Last year, Google purchased a spoon that used vibration in order to \"cancel\" the tremors of Parkinson's sufferers, and just a few months prior a student created a breath-to-speech device to help the speech of Parkinson's victims become more clear.\n\nDopa is currently looking for sponsors to further development, but if the ARC pen can find success, the company plans to integrate the vibration technology into other tools with which Parkinson's sufferers have trouble using, like toothbrushes, silverware, and even computer mice.", "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are talking to drone makers and service providers about testing commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's visual line of sight, currently banned for safety reasons, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe potential partnerships between the Federal Aviation Administration and industry would be a milestone in developing unmanned aircraft that could be used for a variety of business applications such as delivering packages, monitoring crops or inspecting energy transmission pipelines.\n\nIt also raises the likelihood that beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years.\n\nThe proposed FAA rules unveiled in February would lift the current near-ban on commercial drones. But the proposals, as written, still would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by e-commerce company Amazon.com\n\nHowever, while the FAA works to finalize regulations, companies can win agency approval to use commercial drones on a case by case basis. Up to now, the agency has not approved drones capable of flying beyond an operator's line of sight.\n\nBeyond-line-of-sight operations use on-board cameras to enable an operator to make course changes to avoid obstacles, including other aircraft.\n\nThe FAA's consideration of BVLOS operations comes amid intense pressure from Congress and companies who say the technology, originally developed for the military, is already being used in other countries. Failure to adopt the technology, they argue, could stifle the nascent U.S. market for commercial drones.\n\nThe agency has heard from lobbyists representing a broad industrial base ranging from aerospace manufacturers Boeing Co\n\nIn an announcement that could come as early as next week, the FAA is expected to set out plans for partnering with industry on commercial BVLOS operations, according to the people familiar with the matter. The agency would seek to limit safety risks by allowing flights only under restricted conditions, such as uninhabited agricultural land in remote locations.\n\nA FAA spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSources said the new operations could be similar to BVLOS flights that the University of Alaska has been conducting over the past five years in remote regions above the Arctic Circle, where unmanned aerial systems are used with FAA approval to map sea ice, monitor marine life and inspect oil and gas installations.\n\nThe partnerships would be the latest among several FAA moves in recent months to ease restrictions on commercial drones in the United States.\n\nIn April, the FAA loosened its requirement for outdoor testing to occur at designated test sites, by granting Amazon approval to test drones outdoors at a company-owned site. Amazon, other companies and drone industry groups have also used a public comment period on the proposed regulations to urge the agency to allow drones to fly beyond line of sight.\n\n\"BVLOS technology has matured to the point that BVLOS operations are now permitted in some of other countries... where operations have been conducted for years, with high levels of safety,\" commented the Small UAV Coalition, whose members include Amazon, Google Inc\n\nThe coalition asked FAA to permit certain BVLOS operations \"in the relatively near term\", rather than waiting for the proposed rules to be finalized over the next two years.\n\n\"The agency is likely to receive requests from small UAS operators seeking to conduct (beyond line of sight) operations ... long before the rule is finalized,\" Amazon said last week in a comment to the FAA.\n\nBut the Air Line Pilots Association, which opposes beyond line of sight operations because of safety reasons, said such operations would come with \"unacceptable risk.\"\n\n\"The use of an on-board camera cannot replace the awareness provided by direct observation by the operator/pilot or designated visual observer.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Diane Craft)", "In the future, your car will anticipate your every need, from where you're heading to what you'd like to listen to along the way -- and, of course, drive itself.\n\nThat's the vision automakers are test-driving in Silicon Valley, which has emerged as ground zero in the race to re-imagine the automobile. Car companies ranging from General Motors to Mercedes have set up shop in the nation's hotbed of technology and innovation for a dose of inspiration -- and a little wheeling and dealing -- as they hash out how their vehicles will connect to the Internet, interact with users and drive autonomously.\n\nAnd with Apple and Google increasingly eyeing the road, they're shifting their efforts into overdrive.\n\nCars have remained comparatively low-tech as everything from phones to thermostats have undergone digital makeovers. But automakers can no longer deny that connected cars are the way of the future -- and they're pursuing the talent they need to engineer the shift, said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, a consulting firm in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBy focusing on Silicon Valley, automakers are \"almost unanimously admitting they don't have the internal resources to address the issue,\" he said. \"Those who do have the knowledge, insight and skills to address the issue are all in one village.\"\n\nCapped off by Ford's expansion earlier this year, most major automakers now have a presence in Silicon Valley. And even the early entrants have redoubled their efforts in recent years, transforming their Silicon Valley offices from far-flung research outposts to core arms of the company, said Chris Gerdes, who directs the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University. He credits Google -- whose cars routinely whir around sans drivers -- with giving the traditional automakers a sense of urgency.\n\n\"Companies are realizing that to get the most out of their Silicon Valley offices, they need more than just a few people,\" Gerdes said. \"They need to have an office that is doing exciting work and can compete for the very best talent the valley has to offer.\"\n\nThe pace of innovation is so brisk that some car companies project their vehicles will be running autonomously in at least some situations within the next five years. But when it comes to autonomous driving, honing the technology is just the beginning -- the real test will be how drivers react, said Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan Research Center Silicon Valley.\n\nAt Nissan's Sunnyvale, Calif., office, engineers are working on software for autonomous driving alongside a team of in-house anthropologists and sociologists whose mission is to ensure humans remain at the center of the design so they feel comfortable relinquishing the wheel, whether weaving through traffic in San Francisco or cruising through a neighborhood in Berkeley, Sierhuis said. Working with university partners, Nissan recently launched an ambitious research project to study how cultural norms for driving vary from place to place.\n\n\"You can't just rip out the steering wheel without understanding what that means,\" Sierhuis said.\n\nOutside the confines of their labs, automakers are capitalizing on their offices in the valley to form relationships with the tech industry's key players. BMW has a long track record of working with Apple and will have an app on the new Apple Watch, noted Uwe Higgen, who directs the BMW Group Technology Office in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nHonda collaborates with tech companies large and small and recently opened a studio for developers in Mountain View. The release of Android Auto -- Google's platform for apps in cars -- and Apple's rival CarPlay has done much to spur developers' work on cars, said Nick Sugimoto, a senior program director at the Honda Silicon Valley Lab.\n\n\"Customers are really eager to get this in their cars,\" he said.\n\nAuto executives stationed in the Bay Area also act as their companies' eyes and ears in the valley, ensuring that they do not fall behind either the technological curve or the whims of modern drivers.\n\nAnd some automakers are even willing to look beyond the car. Ford is collecting data from cyclists to better understand bike usage, said Jim Buczkowski, Ford's director of Electrical and Electronics Systems for Research and Advanced Engineering. It helps the company prepare for a future in which city dwellers will seamlessly shift between various modes of transportation, perhaps driving their car to a train station, hopping aboard, and then mounting their bikes for the last leg of the journey, he said.\n\n\"We know that our cars and trucks are going to have to work very effectively with other forms of transportation to avoid congestion,\" he said.", "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are talking to drone makers and service providers about testing commercial drones that can fly beyond an operator's visual line of sight, currently banned for safety reasons, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe potential partnerships between the Federal Aviation Administration and industry would be a milestone in developing unmanned aircraft that could be used for a variety of business applications such as delivering packages, monitoring crops or inspecting energy transmission pipelines.\n\nIt also raises the likelihood that beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technology will ultimately be accepted by new commercial drone regulations that the FAA is working to finalize within the next two years.\n\nThe proposed FAA rules unveiled in February would lift the current near-ban on commercial drones. But the proposals, as written, still would not allow for advanced operations such as package delivery services championed by e-commerce company Amazon.com\n\nHowever, while the FAA works to finalize regulations, companies can win agency approval to use commercial drones on a case by case basis. Up to now, the agency has not approved drones capable of flying beyond an operator's line of sight.\n\nBeyond-line-of-sight operations use on-board cameras to enable an operator to make course changes to avoid obstacles, including other aircraft.\n\nThe FAA's consideration of BVLOS operations comes amid intense pressure from Congress and companies who say the technology, originally developed for the military, is already being used in other countries. Failure to adopt the technology, they argue, could stifle the nascent U.S. market for commercial drones.\n\nThe agency has heard from lobbyists representing a broad industrial base ranging from aerospace manufacturers Boeing Co\n\nIn an announcement that could come as early as next week, the FAA is expected to set out plans for partnering with industry on commercial BVLOS operations, according to the people familiar with the matter. The agency would seek to limit safety risks by allowing flights only under restricted conditions, such as uninhabited agricultural land in remote locations.\n\nA FAA spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSources said the new operations could be similar to BVLOS flights that the University of Alaska has been conducting over the past five years in remote regions above the Arctic Circle, where unmanned aerial systems are used with FAA approval to map sea ice, monitor marine life and inspect oil and gas installations.\n\nThe partnerships would be the latest among several FAA moves in recent months to ease restrictions on commercial drones in the United States.\n\nIn April, the FAA loosened its requirement for outdoor testing to occur at designated test sites, by granting Amazon approval to test drones outdoors at a company-owned site. Amazon, other companies and drone industry groups have also used a public comment period on the proposed regulations to urge the agency to allow drones to fly beyond line of sight.\n\n\"BVLOS technology has matured to the point that BVLOS operations are now permitted in some of other countries... where operations have been conducted for years, with high levels of safety,\" commented the Small UAV Coalition, whose members include Amazon, Google Inc\n\nThe coalition asked FAA to permit certain BVLOS operations \"in the relatively near term\", rather than waiting for the proposed rules to be finalized over the next two years.\n\n\"The agency is likely to receive requests from small UAS operators seeking to conduct (beyond line of sight) operations ... long before the rule is finalized,\" Amazon said last week in a comment to the FAA.\n\nBut the Air Line Pilots Association, which opposes beyond line of sight operations because of safety reasons, said such operations would come with \"unacceptable risk.\"\n\n\"The use of an on-board camera cannot replace the awareness provided by direct observation by the operator/pilot or designated visual observer.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Diane Craft)", "If the enjoy affair involving the public markets and social media organizations is above, you can find a lot of suffering to be felt down the line.\n\nInvestors have spent years pouring money into firms in some way described as social media.

The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy.

After all, the last time the index reached a record high it quickly plummeted in what became known as at the dot-com crash.\n\nBut this time the Nasdaq composite index is very different from what it was in 2000, financial advisers say. The bull market that began after the recession may eventually lose steam, but advisers say there's no need for investors to panic or change up their 401(k)s or other retirement accounts.\n\nThe Nasdaq is just a number, says Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. As long as investors have a diverse mix of U.S. and international stocks and bonds in their accounts, Ritter says, there is no need to worry.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite is not dependent on the technology sector like it was in 2000. \"It's diversified,\" says Hugh Anderson, partner and managing Director at HighTower Advisors in Las Vegas.\n\nTech companies still make up a big part of the Nasdaq composite. About 40 percent of the more than 2,500 stocks in the index are tech stocks. That's considerably less than what it was in 2000, when about 65 percent of the index was made up of tech stocks. A more balanced index, which is also led by health care, cuts against another steep drop if the technology sector falls into a slump.\n\nFifteen years ago, many technology companies were unproven startups such as Pets.com or Kozmo.com, and they eventually flopped. Today's tech companies are a big part of everyday life, such as Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., says Beth Lynch, an investment adviser at Schneider Downs Wealth Management in Pittsburgh. These companies are powering the search engines, and making smartphones we use to regularly buy goods online.\n\nSome companies that were on the index in 2000 have grown since. Apple, for example, didn't release the first iPhone until 2007. Today, Apple is the world's largest company with a market capitalization of $760 billion. \"Today you have more stable companies,\" says Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Bank in Philadelphia. Apple and Microsoft Corp., for example, hold billions of dollars in cash.\n\nAnd investors are backing actual results, rather than largely speculating about the potential growth of a startup. Corporate earnings, actual and projected, are what is driving stock prices higher, says Benjamin Beck, managing partner of Beck Bode Wealth Management in Boston. He says investors should focus on what companies expect to earn in the 12 months, not on their share prices or the level of an index.\n\n\"If you're focused on an all-time high,\" says Beck, \"you're on the wrong road.\"\n\nStill, if you're nervous, you can check how much of your retirement account is exposed to technology stocks. Three of the most widely held stock funds in 401(k)s are the Vanguard Institutional Index, the Fidelity Contrafund and the Fidelity Spartan 500 Index, according to 401(k) rating company BrightScope. Although technology represents the largest percentage of each fund's portfolio, its weighting is only slightly bigger than the next largest sector.\n\nYou can check how much exposure you have by looking through the funds in your retirement accounts and plugging the ticker symbols into the \"Instant X-Ray\" on Morningstar.com. The portfolio tool will give you a breakdown of what sectors and types of stocks a fund invests in.\n\nIn the short term, the Nasdaq is likely to fall slightly as investors sell stocks to cash in on recent gains. \"It's part of the normal process,\" says Lynch from Schneider Downs Wealth Management.", "What's a messy blow job? It's basically the interpretive dance of blow jobs. Share Tweet Pin Email By Lane Moore Shares Share Tweet Pin Email Most Read 20th Century Fox Share Tweet Pin\n\nA recent Reddit thread titled \"[Sexual Technique] Messy blowjobs\" sparked some interest in the Cosmopolitan.com office this week. What does \"messy\" even refer to in that context? Aren't all blow jobs messy? Is there one that's Martha Stewart-level clean? Maybe with a white glove on fine linens? One Google search of \"messy blow job\" turns up with the Internet preferred term of \"sloppy blow job\" (why people want to call a sex act \"sloppy\" instead of \"messy,\" I can't possibly understand) and a lot of porn with the search term in it.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nUrban Dictionary's only definition is a quote example of, \"shit lads, i had this amazing sloppy blow job last night, there was buckets of spit involved.\" To hear the Reddit poster tell it, a messy blow job involves \"lots of spitting, messy sounds, tons of moaning, rubbing his dick on any part of me, and complete and total enthusiasm,\" basically putting his penis anywhere at all, which sounded bizarre and kind of awesome to me. Who wouldn't want to participate in a sex act that's so completely freeform and improvised, like an interpretive dance with your partner's junk?\n\nWe Recommend\n\nReddit users immediately jumped on the concept with their own tips and tricks, including:\n\n\"My girlfriend has small breasts, like barely an A cup. But when she rubs her nipples along my cock ... drool.\"\n\nAnd one poet even advised, \"Everything but puking. For that, check with him first.\"\n\nBut these were just random, anonymous people, so I decided to go to the source: porn superstar Chanel Preston, who defined a messy blow job as \"one which uses a lot of spit.\" She gave me a bunch of expert tips on how to give a messy blow job like a pro. Let's do this.\n\n1. Don't overthink it! Be as messy as you want.\n\nSome people are afraid to use a lot of spit because it feels messy, but there is something very sexy about getting all messy and gross during sex. It's not for everyone, but if your partner is willing to try, then definitely give it a shot and see how you like it.\n\n2. Spit as much as you can and drink a bunch of water first if you need to.\n\nSometimes it's not always easy to salivate a lot, especially if you have a dry mouth. Chanel usually gags a little on the dick in order to produce that thick viscous saliva. Also, don't swallow any spit. Just let it roll out of your mouth and down his cock and balls.\n\n3. There's no wrong way to give a messy blow job.\n\nThe only way you could do it wrong is any way where your partner is not enjoying it, which can always be adjusted via communication, so give it a shot and if it doesn't work, you guys can figure out something that will.\n\n4. You don't have to rub his penis all over your body, but you totally can.\n\nRub it wherever you think he would find it sexy or whatever body part you think is sexy -- nipples, vulva, stomach, etc. If you need to ask him what he finds sexy, ask.\n\n5. You don't even have to suck on it the whole time.\n\nChanel has noticed a lot of guys like jerking while sucking. So while you are sucking on his penis, also try and use your hand or hands at the same time.\n\n6. There's no rule book, so make it up as you go along.\n\nThere is no strategy other than doing what your partner likes. There is no one-size-fits-all when it come to blow jobs. Just communicate and experiment to find out what your partner likes best.\n\n7. Even if you lose the rhythm or try something that fails, you can always get it back.\n\nOf course there are times when you finally get a good rhythm and you want to try something a little different and it's not quite your partner's thing, but at least now you know and you won't do it again. Not everyone is going to do things perfectly the first time. Don't ever let that stop you from exploring though.\n\nFollow Lane on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nShare Tweet Pin Email", "Share Tweet Pin Email By Tess Koman Shares Share Tweet Pin Email Most Read Getty Share Tweet Pin\n\nHilary (a pseudonym) was one of so many women who had an angry ex post sexually explicit photos of her online without her consent.

We've been hearing stories that the power house inside the Nexus 6 has been found to swell, causing the rear cover to pop open.\n\nNexus 6 battery explodes for no apparent good reason\n\nBut in the case of this particular user from Twitter the battery of her Nexus 6 actually ended up exploding. Thankfully, no fire ensued. The whole affair happened while the phone was lying unused. It wasn't charging either.\n\nNot that charging overnight should have had destructive side-effects such as this. The affected user took the opportunity to post a bunch of photographs of the affected Nexus 6 on Twitter for the whole world to see.\n\nSince the Nexus 6 isn't a terribly popular phone, you probably haven't heard about these battery issues. Regardless, it seems some items are affected by real problems and hopefully Motorola will find a way to deal with them.\n\nIt's unknown whether the Nexus 6 owner contacted the manufacturing company to complain about the damage, but in all likelihood she did.\n\nIn related news, the Nexus 6 is the only phone Google is waiting to promote its wireless carrier plans in the US, which launched under the banner of Project Fi.\n\nGoogle is offering the chance to user to pick up the handset through Project Fi with a 24-month installment plan ($27 / \u20ac25 per month for the 32GB model and $29 / \u20ac27 for the 64GB model). Naturally one can purchase the device contract-free, if you deem this the better option.\n\nGoogle also offers unlimited domestic talk and text plus unlimited international texts and low fees for cellular data in the US and abroad.\n\n@jasuja whoa! As in, exploded? -- Rohin Dharmakumar (@r0h1n) May 1, 2015", "LOS ANGELES (AP) - After demonstrating the merits of a Japanese-made bullet train to California's governor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is heading to a session with Japanese-Americans to promote expanded trade between his country and the U.S.\n\nAt the halfway point of his three-day visit to California, the Asian leader will attend a Japan-U.S. Economic Forum on Friday in Los Angeles at which he is expected to announce policies to facilitate American investment in Japan, said Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.\n\nThe prime minister, who studied at the University of Southern California's School of Policy, Planning, and Development, will also meet and show support to Japanese students attending U.S. universities, Ito said.\n\nHe is scheduled to attend a reception Friday night, with former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and actor George Takei among the guests.\n\nOutside the economic forum in downtown Los Angeles, about a hundred people chanted and held signs demanding justice for the sexual slaves kept by the Japanese during World War. The protesters, many of Korean or Chinese descent, shouted \"Abe, liar!\" and held signs reading \"Mr. Abe, official apology.\"\n\nJapan maintains that it has already apologized for the sex slaves known as \"comfort women\" held by its imperial army.\n\nOn Thursday, Abe gave Gov. Jerry Brown a hint of what it would be like inside a Japanese-made bullet train, displaying a train simulator for the California leader.\n\n\"There are some people in California who think of high speed rail as a mysterious, very expensive, exotic technology,\" Brown told Abe during their meeting at a San Francisco hotel. \"I hope people see high-speed rail is a reality. If you were able to get a train in a hotel, I think I can get a train built from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\"\n\nBrown has faced opposition in his efforts to build a $68-billion high-speed rail in California to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Abe said during a speech at Stanford University that his country needs to emulate Silicon Valley style, risk and innovation.\n\n\"We would like to capture the dynamism of Silicon Valley,\" he said while announcing plans to send representatives from 200 Japanese companies to \"sail into the rough waves\" of the region during the next five years. He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy. Average annual employee earnings were $116,000, compared with $61,000 nationally. Venture capitalists invested $14.5 billion in businesses, and 76,450 new jobs were created.\n\nEarlier in the week, Abe made the Washington, D.C., rounds with a White House dinner and address to Congress. While on Capitol Hill, he declared \"history is harsh\" and offered condolences for Americans who died in World War II.\n\nHe stopped short of offering an apology sought by U.S. lawmakers for Japanese conduct during the war, including sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of Asian women by Japan's imperial army.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

A group of senators introduced the so-called trade promotion authority bill earlier this month, and last week, committees in the Senate and House of Representatives approved fast-track bills and sent them to their full chambers for votes.\n\nThe trade promotion authority legislation would set some congressional priorities for the TPP and other trade deals while allowing the Obama administration to negotiate the deals with limited congressional input. The legislation would prohibit Congress from adding amendments to trade deals negotiated by the administration when it's time for Congress to vote on them.\n\nThe TPP, first proposed a decade ago, has been negotiated in secret, but leaks have shown that the U.S. and some other countries are pushing for signatory nations to adopt strong new intellectual property laws. There are several other unrelated complaints about the agreement, but most of the criticism from digital rights groups has focused on copyright issues and on a lack of transparency about the negotiations.\n\nBased on the leaks, the U.S. and other nations are pushing strong new intellectual property protections that would require some signatory countries to rewrite their existing laws, criminalize noncommercial sharing of works protected by copyright, and, critics say, could create new criminal penalties for whistleblowers and journalists who access computer systems without permission.\n\nFight for the Future, a digital rights group, launched an online campaign opposed to the Trade Promotion Authority legislation about a week ago, and since then, more than 7,500 websites have added links to the Internet Vote effort. Opponents of the legislation have sent more than 40,000 emails and made more than 3,000 telephone calls to U.S. lawmakers, according to the group.\n\n\"It's inspiring to see thousands of websites and tens of thousands of Internet users coming together so quickly to condemn this outdated and dangerous [trade] legislation,\" Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, said by email. \"Senators ... should know by now that any law that threatens Internet users' rights to communicate, share, learn, and express themselves will be defeated, and the politicians who attach their names to these toxic policies will pay the price at the polls.\"\n\nA second effort, a petition calling on the White House to halt TPP negotiations until it opens the text up to the public, has failed to gain traction so far. The petition, on the White House's We the People petition site, has gathered just 60 signatures in six days.\n\nObama, a Democrat, also faces opposition from some members of his own party. Several of the more liberal Democratic members of Congress have also opposed Obama's call for approval of the fast-track legislation.\n\nThe U.S. public needs to see what's in the deal, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote in a blog post last week.\n\n\"Don't bother trying to Google\" the text of the agreement, she wrote. \"The government doesn't want you to read this massive new trade agreement. It's top secret.\"\n\nWhy is the trade deal secret? \"Here's the real answer people have given me: 'We can't make this deal public because if the American people saw what was in it, they would be opposed to it,'\" she added.\n\nThe Obama administration and several business groups have defended the trade promotion authority legislation, saying it will open up foreign markets to U.S. products and services.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership \"is good for American businesses and American workers,\" Obama said during a press conference Tuesday. \"We will make the case on the merits as to why it will open up markets for American goods, American exports, and create American jobs. When 95 percent of the world's markets are outside our shores, we've got to make sure that we're out there competing. And I'm confident we can compete.\"\n\nIntel and trade group the Telecommunications Industry Association have both called on Congress to pass trade promotion authority legislation.\n\n\"American industries from agriculture to high-tech depend on selling goods and services to the 95 percent of the world's consumers living outside the United States,\" Lisa Malloy, director of policy communications for Intel, wrote in a blog post earlier this month.\n\nThe trade legislation \"is a major milestone in American economic growth and will help businesses large and small create opportunity and success for employees and their families everywhere.\"\n\nGrant Gross covers technology and telecom policy in the U.S. government for The IDG News Service.

The luxury timepiece brand announced its first wearable last month, but did not go into when exactly the TAG Heuer Smartwatch would arrive or indeed how much it will cost. Now the company has announced both and as you would expect from the Swiss company, this is not an affordable product.\n\nTAG Heuer did not launch its smartwatch, but did officially say it was going to make one, teaming up with Google (Android Wear) and Intel (chip tech) to complete the product. Some analysts are saying the companies arrival in the wearable market could be seismic and are comparing it to Apple?s impact.\n\nOf course, that remains to be seen, but TAG Heuer explained why it had decided to go with Google instead of building its own OS:\n\nIt would be absurd, it would be arrogant to believe that we could develop our own [operating system].

He says the modern world is more about interpreting and discussing information, rather than storing it all in our heads.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Dawe, who is chief executive of the OCR exam board, said: \"Surely when they learn in the classroom, everyone uses Google if there is a question. It is more about understanding what results you're seeing rather than keeping all of that knowledge in your head, because that's not how the modern world works.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees. Chris McGovern, spokesperson for the Campaign for Real Education, countered Dawe's argument on the radio show, condemning it as \"dumbing down\" the education system. Claiming UK children are \"three years behind the Chinese, at the age of 15,\" McGovern said: \"You can have an exam in how to use Google - that's not the same thing as having a history exam or a geography exam. We do have to test what children are carrying in their heads.\"\n\nDawe countered: \"It's about understanding the tools they have got available and how to utilise them. When we are asking a question where we know there's access to the internet, we could ask a different question - it's about the interpretation, the discussion.\"\n\nLet exams mimic real life\n\nThe comments comes five months after Professor Eric Mazur, dean of physics at Harvard University, said students should have access to the internet and be able to discuss questions with friends during exams to more accurately reflect the workplace.\n\n\"Let's mimic more real life in our assessment practice,\" he said. \"If you look at students taking an assessment, they're set out in rows, separated by a gap and isolated from any source of information. Once you get your diploma, you never face that situation again.\n\n\"At work you can call whoever you want, you can google anything, yet this is how we assess students. So we should let people talk to each other, we should let people work together. We consider it cheating in that setting but not cheating when they are doing their jobs. So why create this artificial environment?\"", "Two Oxford County schools are getting ready to launching Education Week in their districts.\n\nEmily Stowe Public School in Norwich will be launching education week for the Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB) Monday with an assembly while St. Mary's Catholic High School will kick off Catholic education week for the London District Catholic School Board (LDCSB) with their Spirit Awards.\n\nLisa Munro, principal of Emily Stowe, said the school's morning assembly will celebrate innovation in learning.\n\n\"What we're trying to do as a school - and as a board as well - is to be innovative in our teaching and learning practices,\" Munro said. \"For example, we use an inquiry-based learning approach and that's sort of the way people do business, if you look into Google and some big companies. That's how we're prepping students for their careers in the 21st century.\"\n\nMunro added the school is trying to use technology as a form of creation, with some students demonstrating their learning through iMovie and creating their own \"TED\" talks.\n\nEmily Stowe is also going to be visited by authors Lee Edward Fodi, the author of The Chronicles of Kendra Kandlestar series, and Michael Ulmer, the author of M is for Maple, while all students and staff dress as their favourite storybook characters or as their dream careers.\n\nThe students of Emily Stowe are excited for the upcoming week, Munro said, as they have been preparing hard to showcase learning in their school for the TVDSB at the assembly.\n\n\"I think we celebrate every day that we're in school,\" Munro said. \"But I think, like everything, this is an opportunity to showcase learning and bring it to a forefront and formally celebrate.\"\n\nPaul Lamoureux, principal at St. Mary's, said Monday night's Spirit Awards will honour students who exemplify the seven traits expected of the Catholic graduate.\n\n\"(It's) that they live up to our board's motto and our board's vision,\" Lamoureux said. \"So inspired Christ, learning together (and) serving together - are they living out that?\"\n\nSt. Mary's has nominated Deijanelle Simon, a Grade 12 student, for the Spirit Award for St. Mary's.\n\nThe Catholic education week this year has a theme of exploring paths of joy, with each day having a significant saying.\n\n\"The first day is walking together and sharing stories,\" Lamoureux said. \"The second day talks about \"| exploring paths of joy. The sixth looks at welcoming others to the table. The seventh recognizes Jesus and the breaking of the bread, and the last day is just proclaiming the good news.\n\n\"So each day in our school system we have days designated to live out those messages,\" Lamoureux added.\n\nLamoureux said this is the first time St. Mary's has hosted the Spirit Awards, which he said is an honour.\n\n\"It's an honour because you have everyone from London coming to visit you,\" he said. \"We've always had to travel to London or the surrounding areas, now everyone from London is coming to visit us. So we're preparing our house. We're getting the decorations, we're going to have food, music and entertainment, and we're opening our building to everyone.\n\n\"I'm excited because I want to showcase St. Mary's. I want to show everyone what the best-kept secret is all about.\"", "On a spectacular Saturday last June, the cavernous sixth floor loft of General Assembly, the leading provider of programming classes in Manhattan, just across from the Flatiron Building, began to fill up. People checked in, browsed the juices, chia bars and Brooklyn Roasting Co. coffee, and started pecking on their MacBooks and iPhones.\n\nDress code was mostly T-shirts and jeans, TOMS, Converse or flip-flops. A clique of developers recently back from Google I/O were giggling over a poor-man's Oculus Rift made out of an iPhone, cardboard and duct tape.\n\nA Who's Who of Gotham's food and tech communities convened -- staff from Facebook, Instagram, Cover, AmazonFresh, Mouth, 'wichcraft, Sea to Table, R/GA digital, Google, Sweetgreen, Feeding10Billion.com, Fitbit, Jawbone, U.S. Venture Partners, Union Square Ventures, AccelFoods, Culinary Institute of America, New York Angels -- along with a bevy of start-ups.\n\nAnd then Danielle Gould, the CEO and founder of Food + Tech Connect, a smiley 31 years old with long brown hair, took the microphone. \"This isn't just a community,\" she said. \"It's a movement of many different types of people who want to use technology to improve the food system.\" There was serious business to be done. Gould and her team had spent the last half year organizing this event, dubbed Hack:Dining, Gould's fourth food-focused hackathon.\n\nGlittering in a little black dress -- the queen bee of the food-tech ecosystem -- she explained that the goal wasn't just to put together some very good brains to fix problems in our food system. The team from Google Food, a few unapologetically bespectacled in Google Glass, sought to encourage healthier eating in work cafeterias. The Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group asked for a cloud-based dashboard where restaurants could navigate and comply with Byzantine health codes, anywhere in the world. Chipotle wondered how it could use technology to reduce customer food waste. Applegate wanted a solution for gathering eater feedback in large venues, like stadiums and food festivals.\n\nThese are heady times for the intersection of food and tech. Brita Rosenheim of Rosenheim Advisors reported in December that foodtech and food media industries have doubled in the last three years, investing $2.4 billion in 2014. Companies gathered even more than that -- $3 billion -- in the first quarter of this year alone. In April the Wall Street Journal reported that venture capital firms poured half a billion into agriculture and food last year, up by 54 percent.\n\nWhile there's been talk of a foodtech bubble, Rosenheim thinks we're at the beginning of a long uptrend. The space has just begun to attract interest from large players in food, not to mention completely different industries considering leapfrogging into food through tech. Consider this collage: J. C. Penny partnered with Epicurious.com to market Epicurious-branded cookware; Mars partnered with UC Davis to launch the tech-forward Innovation Institute for Food and Health; Uber is plotting UberEssentials, a 10-minute grocery option; Overstock launched a farmers market subsite. Even Under Armour is flirting with the field through its acquisition of calorie-intake apps MyFitnessPal and Endomondo. David Chang recently raised $25 million to launch Maple, a curated food delivery service. Amazon has rolled out AmazonFresh in Seattle, San Francisco and Brooklyn and launched a different grocery service in India called KiranaNow that's heading for other cities in South Asia. The bustling marketplace hasn't stopped at least a dozen wine, beer and spirits delivery services from rolling out nationwide, including Drizly, Minibar, Saucy, Pink Dot and Klink. (One of them was delivering cannabis in California until regulators asked them to stop.)\n\nThe biggest strategy deal to date seems to be Rocket Internet's multi-billion dollar move to \"create the biggest Internet-based food-ordering service outside of China,\" according to a recent Rosenheim report. The network, internally called the \"Global Online Takeaway Group,\" now owns online food ordering in the Middle East, Asia and Europe, including the following local affiliate sites: Delivery Hero in America, Foodpanda in 14 Asian nations and 11 countries in Africa, HelloFresh in New York and Berlin, Talabat in Dubai, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, La Nevera Roja in Spain, PizzaBo in Italy and Yemeksepeti in Turkey.\n\nNot to mention hundreds of smaller launches, mergers and acquisitions. In the AgFunder newsletter from early March, rounds of funding were announced for SWIIM (a water rights trading platform for farmers), Edyn (a smart garden sensor) and Agribotix (a family of drones and software designed for tending orchards).\n\n6SensorLabs, which recently raised $4 million, is developing what it calls the first portable and accurate gluten sensor, while Rowbot's weed-munching droids can be deployed in flocks of dozens to control weeds -- and plant cover crops! -- between corn plants. Food + Tech Connect (FTC) counted nearly two dozen entities that launched in 2014 to accelerate, incubate and fund food businesses, including two for beer (CraftFund and CrowdBrewed), Barnraiser (a Kickstarter for food businesses), 7-Ventures, launched by 7-Eleven to invest in food and foodtech start-ups, and Cultivian Sandbox, a Chicago-based incubator launched by Monsanto.\n\nGould has ridden this wave, wielding FTC's logo, a brilliant hybrid of a head of wheat and a USB plug. And she has arguably helped fuel this growth by nurturing each new class/generation/vintage of start-ups in the food space.\n\n\"Smart technology is going to eat up the world,\" social media guru and investor Gary Vaynerchuk said recently, while talking about the wearable tech that's also starting to ripple through our virtual foodshed. Vaynerchuk, an early investor in Resy, Drizly, Grove Labs and other foodtech, drinktech and hospitech companies, made his first fortune selling wine online. But he could have easily been talking about smart tractors, handheld cloud-connected food safety probes and the SavorBand, a rubber RFID-enabled wristband developed by NYC-based ClearHart to allows attendees to record everything they liked at food and drink festivals. \"It allows the physical to do so much more. Recall, push content, unlocking virtual places.\"\n\nWhen we consult Yelp for where to eat or stock our pantry from FreshDirect, when a restaurant owner logs in to a dashboard to see how her waitstaff are performing or a corn farmer assesses crop health using drone-gathered data, technology is radically shifting the way we decide what to grow and eat.\n\nIn fact, that's what technology is doing to our food system. It is expanding the food chain. A smart tractor can know things that a farmer has never known. (Of course, a farmer can also know things that a tractor can never know.) \"Be guided by the analytics, not your instinct,\" is the mantra in the tech space. And when we consult Yelp for where to eat or stock our pantry from FreshDirect, when a restaurant owner logs in to a dashboard to see how her waitstaff are performing or a corn farmer assesses crop health using drone-gathered data, technology is radically shifting the way we decide what to grow and eat. Enhancing the physical food chain with a digital overlay. Smart kitchens and cookware appliances have been demoed at the gadget gathering CES for years. At Hack:Dining, I held a smart cutting board that could weigh, identify and log foods being cut. All that info was accessible from a dashboard on my phone or could be fed into my Fitbit nutrition log via Bluetooth.\n\n\"What they are doing is awesome,\" said the serial entrepreneur and investor Alain Bankier of the players assembled to disrupt large-scale dining. Bankier is the former CEO of the Manischewitz Company and is arguably one of the kingmakers of the New York foodtech industry, with investments in Mouth, Plated, Homer and other firms. \"They are dragging the hospitality business into today's world,\" he continued, juggling multiple conversations and grazing pickles and seaweed-topped vegan hot dogs. \"Big, big shift is younger people moving at a rapid rate toward this being the norm.\" He was stream of consciousness now, referring to mobile reservation booking, online grocery shopping, geolocation around what we're eating right now. \"And it's not going to cost us more. It will just happen. Boom. It's happening.\"\n\nDanielle didn't set out to be the queen bee of foodtech. She grew up in Maryland. Her father owns a small advertising agency that specializes in nonprofit, political and car advertising. Her mother was one of the first female insurance agents at New York Life. (\"They turned my mom down 12 times, but she kept going back until they hired her.\")\n\nShe stopped eating red meat when she was 11 years old but would turn pescatarian when she went to Israel and lived on a kibbutz as a high school senior. \"Other than that, I grew up eating lots of processed, low-fat foods.\" There were big family gatherings on the Eastern Shore on summer weekends and feasts for Jewish holidays, which Gould says contributed to \"my proclivity to convene people.\"\n\nIronically, Gould was a self-proclaimed technophobe. \"I was that person that in my computer class in high school always lost files. I was definitely very scared of technology.\"\n\nHer interest in food as more than just something to eat blossomed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2000. A sociology major dabbling in systems thinking and social entrepreneurship, she took a course with environmental scientist William Cronin that described the history of the American environment from the perspective of a loaf of bread. \"It completely changed my life.\" She suddenly started bumping into all sorts of food system examples in her studies. \"I remember visiting a CSA and holding a chicken while discussing vegetarianism. And then we went to a landfill.\" It was five years of \"lots of different twists and turns, and then I had an 'aha' moment where I realized that, like food, the Internet is also a system. The rest is history.\"\n\nWhile pursuing a master's in nonprofit management at the New School, Gould developed dual passions in green buildings and social entrepreneurship, which led her to Nevin Cohen, then associate professor, CUNY School of Public Health, and faculty associate of the NYC food policy center at Hunter College, and one of the few people at the school working on sustainability and green building. A stint in an intentional community in Arizona exposed her to garden beds and a cozy \"energy apron\" built atop a mesa. She returned to New York knowing that food was her future.\n\nGould responded to a job announcement from BrightFarm Systems, a Manhattan-based start-up in the indoor and rooftop farming space, and joined as a sort of utility player, doing PR, business development and administration. Budget was minimal, so Gould invested heavily in Twitter and how to wield it for contact cultivation. \"I became amazed by how much information in the food world we're openly sharing. And this is information that we couldn't get as a company, but that we really needed to inform our consulting work.\" We needed data like how much food was being grown in the city? What are the prices paid to producers? She started asking: \"What if someone could scrape all that data together to get a better real-time picture of what's going on in the food system?\"\n\n\"I realized that at the core of so many of the issues in our food system is this core lack of information flow. All of a sudden, technology became a thing that you could use, to connect people, to aggregate ideas and to improve decision making.\" Gould threw herself into this effort. Staying up all night and trying to build a framework that could be used by others like her and even those she didn't yet know. \"I wanted to build this smart grid for food.\"\n\n\"I was starting from a very data-centric standpoint. But at the core, people don't necessarily want to share their data. It's really about establishing trust. It's about connecting people offline. It's about improving the systems, and better understanding what needs to be built. And how to build things that are better.\"\n\nAnd then she got an alert from Meetup announcing a new group: the Food+Tech Meetup. \"There were three of us that showed up,\" says Holley Atkinson, the tech strategist and food activist. The third was Elizabeth McVay Greene, who created the Meetup. (The group now has over 2,000 registered members, and the meetups themselves are packed to the gills.) Greene and Gould hit it off. Their big shared idea was the \"Networked Food System\" -- a food system whose web of support wasn't built only of fields and farms and freight haulers but also access to data, digital communication and automation. \"I had an idea for an app that connected food artisans with underutilized kitchen space,\" said Gould. Food + Tech Connect became the landing page for a SurveyMonkey to test the idea. They quickly moved onto other ideas, although the survey (and their social media-based link-spreading) was driving about 70 respondents a day. They started posting content (lists, links, graphics) to share what they were finding in the foodtech space. One of the first posts was an infographic of the global food system. It went viral. Michael Pollan included it as his link of the day. What Gould found most intriguing and exciting was that just as many food people were sharing it as designers, technologists, economists, politicians.\n\nAmong those drawn to it was Will Turnage. \"Oh my gosh, it's my people,\" Turnage recalls feeling. An avid cook and senior vice president of technology at the ad agency R/GA, Turnage had caught the foodtech bug, collaborating with chef Michael Ruhlmann on the Ratio app and the Bread Baking Basics app. In these early meetups, often at Jimmy's 43, the format included giving everyone an opportunity to make a rapid presentation on what they were working on. \"It's a very entrepreneurial space,\" says Turnage. \"The meetings were filled with farmers, cooks, homebrewing coders, graphic designer-jammakers. You kind of had all walks of life coming into the space.\" Among the first expressions of this nascent creativity was when Turnage and Mike Lee, a chef (who would become Gould's husband), presented \"My Robotic Kitchen Planned This Dinner Party\" at SXSW in 2012. \"We got together and pitched this idea to South By and then built the software, and then threw a dinner party, and then gave the talk.\" (Google it; the slideshare still exists.) This presentation ultimately spawned Studiofeast, a pop-up dinner party platform in Brooklyn.\n\nToday, nearly all Food + Tech Connect's activities contribute in some way to building out that grid, from collecting feedback from their online entrepreneur courses to building up an online database of interviews with movers and shakers in the space. \"I was starting from a very data-centric standpoint. But at the core, people don't necessarily want to share their data. It's really about establishing trust. It's about connecting people offline. It's about improving the systems, and better understanding what needs to be built. And how to build things that are better.\"\n\nAnd Gould has become a keystone individual in the foodtech ecosystem in New York and beyond. \"She came out of nowhere when there wasn't all this New York interest in this in 2009 and 2010,\" said Paul Manteucci, an angel investor at U.S. Ventures who focuses on food and ag. \"She's really been a major catalyst in making it all happen.\" Manteucci first reached out to Gould when one of his advisers, Ken Caplan of Blackstone, saw an article on Gould in the Wall Street Journal. Manteucci, whose Twitter handle is @foodcrunch, cold-called her. They met up the next time he was in New York and have been in contact ever since. \"We meet quite frequently to talk and give each other access to each other's network,\" he says. Manteucci, who also founded a nonprofit called Feeding 10 Billion to help entrepreneurs doing food system change, recently collaborated with Gould on a short course on raising money for your food start-up. \"In terms of foodtech, which is the end of the supply chain\" -- compared to agtech or croptech -- \"I'd say that she's taken pretty much the lead nationally. There's a view that we were pioneers back then and now it seems like everybody is interested in food.\"\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the first-ever hackathon was held in 1999, either at Sun Microsystems or UC Berkeley. The events gather coders, designers and venture capitalists to quickly develop new software, often subsisting on energy drinks and little sleep.\n\nFood + Tech Connect's hackathons are notably different from most in two ways: much better food and a diverse group working around a goal rooted in a broken food system. At the very first one in 2010, which was in SoHo, one team built software to ease group buying of whole animals. Another hackathon project was all around food policy -- and landed Gould a closed-door meeting at the White House. Another team was focused on using data to create a data visualization around something. \"It was one of the first hackathons I had ever been to that was more content-based than technology-based,\" said Turnage. Flyers on the tables asked: \"What would the world look like if healthier food was affordable?\"\n\nAttendees were given a handbook that contained \"The Design Hacking Toolkit,\" a sort of 101 of future-friendly design thinking. The mission: \"You're here to hack and improve someone's journey as they try to accomplish good in the world of dining.\"\n\n\"What works? What doesn't work? What would you change?\" the facilitator Mike Lee asked repeatedly that night. Lee, founder and head of Studio Industries, a future-oriented branding and product strategy firm, popped in on teams consuming reams of Post-its, posting queries at GitHub, drafting mock-ups in Proto. io, honing pitches with Keynotopia. \"Who are your users? What are their needs? What insights influence your answer?\" (Remember, we're talking about food here.)\n\nFor instance, leadership from Applegate and Farm Aid aimed to get foodservice to \"hack stadium food\" -- that is, replace Bud Light with local microbrews, offer a humanely raised heritage hot dog, fresher buns, small-batch sauerkraut on compostable dishware. Google had sent over a few executive chefs to listen in. And why are they all here? \"It's a question of wanting to be in as many places as possible,\" said Holley Atkinson, sporting a black Hack//Dining shirt. \"It's not either-or if an innovator or forward-thinking company is going to want to be part of the discussion.\" The power of crowd sourcing, group thinking, they believe in it.\n\n\"Danielle has this great ability to bring a wide variety of different stakeholders in this intersection of food and tech together without imposing her own perspective on the overall discussions,\" said Michiel Bakker, the head of Google Food, which coordinates food and wellness for Google's 50,000 employees worldwide. \"She creates platforms and opportunities for people to have what we would call casual collisions. They tend to produce all kinds of interesting and new things.\"\n\nThis was the third hackathon Applegate had co-hosted with Food + Tech Connect. \"It's rare that issues within the food system are tackled by groups that contain techies, designers, farmers, policymakers, entrepreneurs,\" said Gina Asoudegan, director of communications for Applegate, who was there because hackathons can help the company fulfill its mission of \"changing the meat we eat.\" According to Asoudegan, one example of tech assisting the nose-to-tail utilization of meat relies on a \"cloud-based inventory network,\" which facilitates meat and poultry distribution from small, regional farms, providing the necessary economies of scale and streamlined supply chain to sell to large foodservice accounts like hospitals and school districts. Asoudegan finds the holistic approach and tireless passion of these hackathons immensely effective and impactful. At the Hack//Meat event in San Francisco, Applegate presented a challenge \"that we were certain we understood from every angle,\" Asoudegan explained. \"However, when we presented it to the attendees, someone spoke up and completely reframed the problem in a way we never could have done with the knowledge base we were working from.\"\n\nThis became FTC's first pivot: How could we support them to build awesome stuff? Then our goal is to be kind of the connector and teacher in all of that. \"We're still figuring out the best way to do it,\" said Gould, \"but that's the ultimate vision.\"\n\nAsoudegan listed how technology could bolster her lobbying work by quickly and widely measuring consumer sentiment on genetically modified foods, antibiotic use in livestock, farm estate tax crises. Food companies can hone their marketing materials and respond to real-time demands, and so can politicians, ideally. \"It's all possible, but it will take new ideas and solutions -- many of which will involve technology.\"\n\n\"Our goal is to create this infrastructure for the networked food system,\" Gould told the crowd. All of a sudden there were all these other companies that were starting to build pieces of this smart grid -- from allergen databases like Ingredient1 and the food investment mapping reports from Rosenheim to AgFunder's agtech start-up database. Why should Food + Tech Connect be re-creating the wheel these start-ups were doing better and faster? This became FTC's first pivot: How could we support them to build awesome stuff? Then our goal is to be kind of the connector and teacher in all of that. \"We're still figuring out the best way to do it,\" said Gould, \"but that's the ultimate vision.\"\n\nEven as all this dough gets plowed into foodtech -- not to mention agtech (farm drones, handheld food safety sensors, robotic poultry butchers), hospitech (robot waiters, iPad-based menus) and nutritech (edible packaging, personal Food IDs) -- there's plenty of concern that the same venture capital model that could push valuation of Uber, Periscope, Instagram and Instacart to new heights, may be unprepared to deal with our most essential human endeavor -- feeding ourselves. \"I've got serious concern that the 'move fast and break things mentality' can help fix our food system,\" said Michael Lippold of FreshRealm.\n\nManteucci is similarly wary that the approach he uses in his day job may run roughshod over the food chain, with no guarantee of making it more sustainable, equitable or even more delicious. \"This roaring interest in foodtech and agtech isn't that different in many ways from the introduction of the tractor,\" said Matt Rothe, co-founder of the FEED Collaborative at Stanford. Like previous generations of farm tools, foodtech threatens to set farmers on a technology treadmill that ultimately pushes them to borrow money or scale up in order to justify the investment. \"This is an allegory for every technology that has been developed since, and that includes artificial pesticides and fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, it includes specialization of farming equipment and technology,\" said Rothe, who was previously the director of operations at Niman Ranch and led the Sustainable Food Program for Stanford Dining. \"It's all the same story.\"\n\nIt's true that if you look at the spectrum of foodtech innovations, they run the gamut from mission-focused apps to connect food pantries and food to ideas and products that verge on sci-fi creepy: the data-driven meal-replacement powder Soylent that talks of eliminating the need to cook; or the robotic bartenders being demoed in Tokyo hotels and on cruise ships; or the 20,000-acre citrus groves using drones to scout for disease outbreaks. Which should make us glad that Gould has surrounded herself with sustainability-minded allies and mentors, and sees technology as a tool to bring good, healthy food to people everywhere.\n\nGould recently spearheaded the American contingent at Seeds & Chips, the first international foodtech expo in Milan. She returned emboldened and rejuvenated by the different approach to foodtech in Europe. More important, because there's little venture capital culture in the Old World, most of the entrepreneurs she met were single-mindedly focused on creating an amazing experience for their users (folks ordering food online in small-town Italy; apps to streamline regional procurement for school cafeterias) rather than building-to-sell as American entrepreneurs are wont to do.\n\n\"Tech won't solve fundamental problems in the food system, but it is a critical component,\" said Cohen of CUNY, \"and FTC has become the place to go for information on innovations in this sector.\"\n\nReally, Food + Tech Connect is not a media company or a data aggregator or a groovy meetup. It is a connection machine, as the name implies, between the world of food and the world of technology. Gould calls herself a \"social alchemist and data forager\" on her Twitter profile. \"I connect innovators at the intersection of food & gov 2.0, tech, data science, design, research, entrepreneurship.\"\n\nWhich explains Gould's latest pivot -- ed.foodtechconnect.com. In this realm, too, Gould's special sauce is the ability to open the door wider. To not just play to the coders and geeks, but to put them in a room in front of Danny Meyer. An early adopter of such tools as OpenTable, Meyer talked about how hospitality is just as important when making a reservation online as when on the phone. Food + Tech Connect partnered with a Union Square Hospitality Group alum to teach \"The Power of Brand: Growing Your Restaurant,\" a first-of-its-kind bootcamp, that culminates with a discussion with Danny Meyer and Marcus Samuelsson.\n\nFTC is an aggregator of data but also a sort of nurturing force for the companies that generate this data. And it's a growing eco-system that stretches the food chain that we currently know into other dimensions. Equipt a standard tractor with a few sensors and servos, and you give the farmer access to information they have never had. Instead of recipe books in our home pantry, platforms like Food52 and FeedFeed blow the culinary universe wide open -- at our fingertips. What does a cloud-based food system look like? What does food look like in the cloud? Is it better for us or worse?\n\n\"There's so much innovation going on in the food space, nobody knows how to make money off of it,\" said Turnage. \"Food + Tech Connect has hit on something that allows them to create huge amounts of value in the food world, in the tech world, in the emerging business space.\" Food start-ups are unique because, as Turnage says, \"there's a pairing of this millennia-old food artisanship with this new world of mobile and online and digital and Twitter marketing and Pinterest.\"\n\nThis spring, FTC announced its first e-course. (\"This course will teach you everything you need to launch a kick-ass crowdfunding campaign,\" the course promo announced.) They've had hundreds of sign-ups and will be rolling out additional course offerings in e-commerce, business planning and true-cost accounting.\n\nManteucci, who taught a popular fund-raising course through Food + Tech Connect last fall, thinks the demand is national. \"Education for entrepreneurs is the right focus. It will be interesting to see the audience when Danielle takes it to places like Minneapolis and Denver and the Bay Area, other places where there's a lot of entrepreneurs working on food and tech.\"\n\nThroughout the food chain, a new generation of future-friendly companies come to calcified issues with fresh eyes and see new solutions. \"What would it look like if we started over?\" Hampton Creek Foods has famously asked. (Remember, we're talking about food.)\n\n\"New York is this multi-headed monster that could dominate the space, especially the end of the food chain, more than Silicon Valley.\"\n\nGould is also focused on a bigger geopolitical aspiration: establishing New York as the global center of innovation and entrepreneurship around food and technology. \"New York is poised to become that foodtech hub because, unlike most other cities, New York is a hub for a diverse number of industries. We have a strong tech community, but fashion is based here, media is based here, Wall Street is based here,\" says R/GA's Turnage. Manteucci agrees: \"New York is this multi-headed monster that could dominate the space, especially the end of the food chain, more than Silicon Valley.\"\n\nTo further plant that flag in the sand, later this year, Gould and Lee are launching a brick and mortar \"innovation space\" in lower Manhattan that will be part co-working opportunity, part accelerator, part mini-MBA school. \"A project in support of good food innovation,\" according to Lee.\n\n\"Our goal is to work with our multi-disciplinary network partners to build a robust ecosystem for food system innovation,\" said Gould. And then there's the food mission. \"We want to increase the supply and accessibility of good food,\" says Gould. \"We're going to do this by lowering the barriers to success for entrepreneurs and by making it easier for big companies to do good.\"", "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.-Poison's \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" blared from the speakers this morning as 300 credit union executives gathered to hear CSCU \u00ad\u00adSenior Vice President of Finance & Technology Tom Davis talk about the future of emerging payments at the 2015 CSCU Solutions conference in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nIntroduced as \"the Mick Jagger of payments\" by the lead singer of an '80s cover band that kicked things off, Davis spent about an hour talking about where one of the credit union industry's biggest sources of revenue is headed.\n\nThe number of credit unions is dropping, he warned, citing predictions that there will only by about 5,400 credit unions by 2018. \"Look around you; some of you might not be here by then,\" he warned. \"You have to realize the value of your payment products.\"\n\nThe mood quickly turned serious as Davis ran through the litany of companies elbowing their way into the payments sector - each carrying its own set of risks, opportunities and threats for credit unions. They included big names, such as Amazon Payments, PayPal, Apple Pay, Square, Isis, Google, Samsung and even Facebook, which launched a payment feature within its Messenger tool in March. \"Facebook?!\" Davis exclaimed. \"Who the heck thought Facebook would start taking payments?\"\n\nTo Davis, the opportunities in emerging payments seem to outweigh the risks, however. \"We're going to be OK,\" he told the crowd. \"We're going to be just fine.\"\n\nMuch of his focus was on Apple Pay, which he said is still a small player despite its highly publicized launch.\n\nThough about two-thirds of contactless dollars go through Apple Pay right now, he said, Apple Pay as a whole is just 0.07% of consumer spend. In fact, he said, 85% of iPhone 6 users who have credit cards haven't used Apple Pay.\n\n\"It hasn't taken off yet,\" he said. \"There's a lot of talk about it. We know it's there, but we've still got a long way to go. There's a lot of disinterest in that space right now. It's just not there yet.

He compared the effort to Japan sending players to Major League Baseball teams.\n\nHis country also will send 30 entrepreneurs to pitch ideas to Silicon Valley investors.\n\nAbe also met with Google and Facebook executives and visited electric carmaker Tesla Motors, which is building electric cars in a plant first opened by General Motors more than 50 years ago.\n\nAbe's itinerary included a discussion with business leaders at a resort on Sand Hill Road, a busy stretch of street known as the epicenter of tech venture-capital companies that have launched Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants.\n\n\"This Japanese administration has been focusing on changing its economy to a growth-based system built on innovation,\" said Japanese economic researcher Takeo Hoshi, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \"This is probably the best place in the world to look at that.\"\n\nThe region is home to Google, Apple and other leading tech firms that help drive the U.S. economy.

Join our communities for Android, Internet of Things, Intel\u00ae RealSense\u2122 Technology and Windows to download tools, access dev kits, share ideas with like-minded developers, and participate in hackathon's, contests, roadshows, and local events.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article covers design considerations for tablet apps, including UI design, session length, accommodating user differences, and localization. Debugging and optimization practices are explored. It also covers the impact that different app deployment methods have on the capabilities available to your app. With the advice in this article, you will be poised to create an app that distinguishes itself for your customers who use Intel\u00ae Android* tablets.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntel engineers have worked with developers large and small to enhance their apps for Intel Android tablets. We've seen many examples of design decisions that lead to success. We are sharing a summary of what we've seen and learned in the hope that it will also help you to be successful.\n\nFrom concept to design to implementation, developers targeting Intel Android tablets have an opportunity to make their apps something really special. Conceptual integrity, effective design, environment choice, and tool selection are some of the many vital aspects developers have to juggle. This article suggests a few considerations to keep in mind in order to make use of the potential these devices hold.\n\nWhat's Your Big Idea?\n\nThe best apps and games each have one core idea and serve it perfectly. If you have boiled your idea down to its kernel of utility or fun, exploring that thoroughly will inform most of your other development decisions. If you have no such purpose statement, you'll likely end up with a product that has unrelated features, feels clunky and arbitrary, and is passed over by potential customers in favor of apps that do one thing really well. With proper conceptual integrity, you'll spot opportunities to enhance your design and avoid spending development effort on capabilities that your users already get from other apps.\n\nDesign for the Most Devices Possible\n\nTablets and smartphones are everywhere, with a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. While it would be wise to have a target device in mind, this is only the beginning. Your app should run perfectly on your ideal target, but scale well to a range of platforms. To make smaller screens serve up your visuals most faithfully, design for the largest screen your app will be run on and scale down to the viewable area. There are varied approaches supporting multiple screen sizes; in the case of a web-based game, it could be as simple as drawing everything to a large canvas and drawing that canvas to another that fits the screen adaptively, or drawing at different resolutions and scaling in JavaScript* or CSS.\n\nFigure 1: Fixed size UI elements may appear too small on larger tablet screens\n\nAnother consideration is that all controls and text still need to be useful at the small-screen end of the spectrum. There are significant resources available online for design guidance on various platforms. Since Windows 8 modern design was created for touchscreens, we encourage developers to learn and follow the modern design principles and WinRT app guidelines, as they hold true for Android devices as well.\n\nThese conventions are quite useful for things like optimal spacing and layout under normal conditions. There is a valid reason for each convention. Understanding the standards, applications, and rationales, you can make the best use of them - including intentionally breaking the rules for a desired effect.\n\nDesign for Mobility\n\nWith average users checking their phone between 100-900 times per day, casual game sessions lasting around 3 minutes, and locations ranging from home to work and everywhere in between (on public transportation, at restaurants, etc.), the varied environments of mobile apps and games have a significant impact on their usability.\n\nIf you're making a game, the general time frame for play sessions is a matter of minutes. This does not mean sprawling epic adventures are prohibited, but it does mean that there should be a mechanism that allows for users to step away at almost any point and have little to no trouble getting back into the game. Whether this mechanism is short bursts of immersive battles or puzzles punctuated by level select screens, or as simple as a persistent pause/game menu that summarizes what you're doing in the game, most users will need the ability to pick up and put down their device.\n\nSimilarly, if your app requires perfect silence and lighting, few will be able to make use of it anywhere but home - and questionably so even there. Everything from color choice to sound modulation is important in ensuring users have a good experience.\n\nDesign for People\n\nIf you are in the unusual situation of creating apps for a very narrow subset of the population, you can tailor your design to their needs. Most applications don't have this luxury. Design should be as usable for as many people as possible.\n\nIn addition to the previous mention of situational environments like public transportation, there are 360 million people with hearing loss, 285 million people with visual impairment, and 280 million people with color blindness worldwide. Most users who need assistance will already have some sort of solution in place, but this still needs attention in design and development. If there is any way to add aural cues to an image-intensive application, closed captions to game speech, and identifiable symbols when differentiating among colored objects or a color-blind aware palette where all important colors differ in luminosity, these considerations will go a long way towards ensuring that anyone who downloads your product will be able to use it.\n\nLocalization is another area where many games and apps end up having to add development time and money just to expand to other countries. With a potential cost of $10k-$15k per language, you should minimize the text that needs to be localized. Can your app get its point across with jargon symbols that span the globe? Can the characters in your game speak in universal emoji rather than words? Each step towards interacting directly with the user's mind rather than their vocabulary will increase your potential audience for no additional cost.\n\nEnvironments Abound\n\nIf your app is not going to use a preexisting game engine, one of the first implementation decisions is what kind of executable your app will have: native, web, or hybrid.\n\nNative\n\nNative apps work at a low level, allowing access to more powerful hardware resources but imposing additional restrictions on development and porting to other platforms. The most common language for native Android development is Java, generally through the basic Android* SDK (Software Development Kit) or NDK (Native Development Kit). Tool suites such as Intel\u00ae INDE (Integrated Native Development Experience) focus on both Java and C++. Intel INDE contains not only compilers but also analysis tools that will help you identify and fix performance problems in your app.\n\nWeb\n\nFrom browser games to online tools, web apps are versatile and easily distributed but often lack power and - as the name implies - usually necessitate internet connectivity to function. HTML5 and JavaScript* are the standard here. If the app is simply functioning as an interface to some server-side tool, this is a great option; the downside is that every user will be accessing those servers, driving hosting costs higher to meet demand.\n\nHybrid\n\nTo make use of the flexible nature of web apps as well as the power of mobile device hardware, tools such as the Intel XDK (Cross-platform Development Kit) are ideal for crafting hybrid apps - web technology embedded in a native wrapper. The same JavaScript web apps mentioned above can be imported, sprinkled with hardware-leveraging API calls, and topped with \"device ready\" code to create native packages on mobile platforms.\n\nFigure 2: Your choice of executable impacts both you and your customers\n\nThe decision of whether to go with a native, web, or hybrid app largely depends on the intended usage, resources and functionality required, and developer familiarity with various languages. This decision in turn determines how the app can be distributed, used, and monetized.\n\nTread Lightly\n\nA user-friendly interface goes a long way, but a device-friendly app footprint is necessary to get the most out of your development. Unwieldy download size, unruly resource usage, and unnecessary required permissions can all be barriers to entry or continued use (and impede word-of-mouth sales from your customers).\n\nInitial download size can be reduced by having subsequent \"additional file\" downloads. Unfortunately this can annoy your users, and it implies a larger problem that may also affect performance: suboptimal handling of bloated assets. The libraries of textures, models, and sounds that represent most of that file size will eventually need to be loaded into memory (if this isn't the case, there are other problems), which will slow down your app. In addressing the root cause, not only will your app run more smoothly, the initial and subsequent downloads can be significantly reduced.\n\nThe solution for many apps is an approach focused on reusability that was pioneered in the olden days of memory-constrained development. Using the same images and sounds with different palettes and masks can provide necessary variety while minimizing space and resources required. Even if strict reuse isn't an option, minimizing the files that need to be accessed will provide a demonstrable performance increase. For example, World of Goo creates ad hoc texture atlases during level loading, so even image assets that are used elsewhere will be combined into a single resource. This performance increase will pay off in the next step: analysis and optimization.\n\nSquash Bugs and Streamline Execution\n\nIn an ideal world, your app would run perfectly the first time, and need no improvements. This is not our world. In any application much more complex than a \"hello world\" starter, there will invariably be bugs. The worst bugs don't break your app but just slow it down, either in performance or latency which impacts the user experience. Similarly, things like overdraw and unused duplicate buffers - while not bugs - drain performance and battery life. These are all opportunities to further improve your app. The best way to find such opportunities is profiling tools and performance analyzers.\n\nThe Intel\u00ae XDK offers debugging in the emulator, remote debugging on connected Android devices in the Debug tab, and performance analysis information in the Profile tab.\n\nFigure 3: Intel\u00ae XDK makes hybrid app development easy\n\nNot using the Intel XDK? The Intel\u00ae GPA (Graphics Performance Analyzers) is a suite of performance analysis tools designed to help you identify suboptimal areas for improvement. While well-suited for high-powered PC applications, Intel\u00ae GPA also works on Android apps, earning its place among the other native tools in Intel\u00ae INDE.\n\nSummary\n\nThere are a great many considerations when developing a mobile app or game. Conceptual integrity is key in navigating the myriad options and paring down the infinite creative space. Each aspect of development can impact those before and after it, emphasizing the need for forethought and iteration. Conventions of touch interfaces, mobile visual and sound design, and globalization provide great starting points and food for thought in this exercise.\n\nIntel\u00ae INDE delivers a huge set of tools for native developers. Intel\u00ae XDK helps web developers join the fray with a full-service suite of development, emulation, testing, debugging and packaging functionality. Both have ample documentation and forum support that will only continue to grow.\n\nThe approaches and tools in this article are drawn from lessons that Intel engineers have learned from helping many app developers. They will help you maximize your app's chances of becoming a popular, treasured part of your customers' lives. Pursuing an optimal concept, design, and implementation is an extremely intensive but ultimately rewarding undertaking.\n\nReferences Android* Game Engines https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/choosing-the-right-engine-for-your-x86-based-android-game Android* SDK http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android* NDK http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html Audio Design Challenges, Gamasutra http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134761/aaalite_audio_design_challenges_.php?print=1 Blindness Fact Sheet, World Health Organization http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/ Color Theory Application, UX Matters http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/01/applying-color-theory-to-digital-displays.php Colorblindness http://www.vischeck.com/faq/ Deafness Fact Sheet, World Health Organization http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs300/en/ Drawing Pixels is Hard http://phoboslab.org/log/2012/09/drawing-pixels-is-hard Game Localization Handbook, Google Books http://books.google.com/books?id=sN5Glp9sLj0C&printsec=frontcover - v=onepage&q&f=false Intel\u00ae GPA https://software.intel.com/en-us/gpa Intel\u00ae INDE https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-inde Intel\u00ae XDK http://xdk.intel.com/ Mobile Unlocking Frequency http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2449632/How-check-phone-The-average-person-does-110-times-DAY-6-seconds-evening.html Mobile Gaming Session Information http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/articles/mobile-gaming-sessions-now-longer/ Modern Design Principles, MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh781237.aspx Overdraw Visualization in GPA https://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/gpa/13.4/win/Overdraw_Visualization.htm Supporting Multiple Screens, Android http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html Using GPA with Android apps works on Android apps WinRT App Guidelines, MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465424.aspx World of Goo Case Study https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/world-of-goo-stretches-to-android-on-x86 XCOM case study (UDN only) https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/171391/turbocharging-xcom-an-unreal-optimization.html Intel\u00ae XDK Emulate tab https://software.intel.com/en-us/xdkbook/devemulator Intel\u00ae XDK Debug tab https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/articles/using-the-debug-tab Intel\u00ae XDK Profile tab https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/articles/using-the-profile-tab About the Author\n\nBrad Hill is a Software Engineer at Intel in the Developer Relations Division.

In September 2013, Apple released the iPhone* 5 with a 64-bit A7 processor onboard. Thus began the mobile technology race.\n\nIt turns out that the Android-based kernel GNU/Linux* has been supporting processors with 64-bit registers for a long time. Ubuntu is \"GNU/Linux\" while Android is \"Dalvik/Linux\". Dalvik is the process virtual machine (VM) in Google's Android operating system, which specifically executes applications written for Android. This makes Dalvik an integral part of the Android software stack, which is typically used on mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers, as well as more recently on devices such as smart TVs and wearables. Nevertheless, all developers who use the NDK have to rebuild their programs under the latest architecture, and the ease or difficulty of this process depends on the tools that Google will provide. In addition, Google should provide backward compatibility, i.e., NDK 32-bit applications should run in Android 64-bit.\n\nThe first Intel 64-bit processors for mobile devices were created in the 3rd quarter of 2013 and were the new powerful multicore System on a Chip (SoC) for mobile and desktop devices. This new SoC family consists of Intel\u00ae AtomTM processors for tablets and 2 in 1 devices, Intel\u00ae Celeron\u00ae processors, and Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae processors for 2 in 1 devices, laptops, desktop PCs and All in One PCs.\n\nIn October 2014, Google released a preview emulator image of the 64-bit Android L for developers. This allowed them to test their programs and rewrite code, if necessary, before the OS is released. In a Google+ blog developers indicated that programs entirely created with Java* do not require porting. They ran them \"as is\" in the L- version of the emulator, which supports 64-bit architecture. Those using other languages, especially C and C++, will have to perform some steps to build against the new Android NDK. Several older versions of Android-based devices with 64-bit processors are on the market. However, manufacturers may have to update them rather quickly; otherwise, there will be a lack of software apps for users.\n\nAndroid 64-bit L emulator\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced that Android would support 64-bit in the coming L release. This is great news for those who want the most performance possible out of their devices and apps. The list of benefits highlighted by Google in this update include a larger number of registers, increased addressable memory space, and new instruction sets.\n\nThe Android emulator supports many hardware features likely to be found on mobile devices, including:\n\nAn ARM* v5 CPU and the corresponding memory-management unit (MMU) A 16-bit LCD display One or more keyboards (a Qwerty-based keyboard and associated Dpad/Phone buttons) A sound chip with output and input capabilities Flash memory partitions (emulated through disk image files on the development machine) A GSM modem, including a simulated SIM Card A camera, using a webcam connected to your development computer. Sensors like an accelerometer, using data from a USB-connected Android device\n\nThis is a great step forward for building our favorite devices and apps. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait for Android L to drop before we can enjoy these new performance boosts. A few weeks after Android L releases, Revision 10 of the Native Development Kit (NDK) should be posted with support for the three 64-bit architectures that will be able to run the new version of Android: arm64-v8a, x86_64, and mips64. If you've built an app using Java, your code will automatically have better performance on the new x86 64-bit architecture. Google has updated the NDK to revision 10b and added an emulator image developers can use to prepare their apps to run on devices built with Intel's 64-bit chips.\n\nKeep in mind, the NDK is only for native apps, not those built with Java on the regular Android SDK. If you have been looking forward to getting your apps running on 64-bit, or if you need to update to the latest version of the NDK, hit the developer portal to get your download started.\n\nDeveloping with the x86_64 Android NDK\n\nThe Native Development Kit (NDK) is a toolset that allows you to implement parts of your app using native code languages such as C and C++. For certain types of apps, this can be helpful so you can reuse existing code libraries written in these languages, but most apps do not need the Android NDK. You need to balance the benefits of using the NDK against its drawbacks. Notably, using native code on Android generally does not result in a noticeable performance improvement, but it always increases your app complexity. You should only use the NDK if it is essential to your app and not because you simply prefer to program in C/C++.\n\nYou can download the latest version of Android NDK from: https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html\n\nIn this section I'll review how to compile a sample application using the Android NDK.\n\nWe will use the sample application, san-angeles, located in the Android NDK samples directory: $ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles\n\nNative code is located in the jni/ directory:\n\n$ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles/jni\n\nNative code is compiled for specified CPU architecture(s). Android applications may contain libraries for several architectures in one apk file.\n\nTo set target architectures you need to create the Application.mk file inside the jni/ directory. The following line will compile the native libraries for all supported architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := all\n\nSometimes, it's better to specify a list of target architectures. This line compiles the libraries for x86 and ARM architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := x86 armeabi armeabi-v7a\n\nBecause we are building a 64-bit app, we need to compile the libraries for x86_64 architectures:\n\nAPP_ABI := x86_64\n\nRun the following command inside the sample directory to build libraries:\n\ncd $ANDROID_NDK/samples/san-angeles\n\nAfter the successful build, open the sample in Eclipse* as an Android application and click \"Run\". Select the emulator or a connected Android device where you want to run the application.\n\nTo support all available devices you need to compile the application for all architectures. If the apk file size with libraries for all architectures is too big, consider following the instructions in Google Play Multiple APK Support to prepare a separate apk file for each platform.\n\nChecking supported architectures\n\nYou can use this command to check what architectures are included in apk file:\n\naapt dump badging file.apk\n\nThe following line lists all architectures:\n\nnative-code: 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'x86', 'x86_64'\n\nAnother method is to open the apk file as a zip file and view subdirectories in the lib/ directory.\n\nOptimization of 64-bit programs Reducing the amount of memory an app consumes\n\nWhen a program is compiled in the 64-bit mode, it consumes more memory than its 32-bit version. This increase often goes unnoticed, but memory consumption can sometimes be two times higher than 32-bit apps. The amount of memory consumption is determined by the following factors:\n\nSome objects, like pointers, require larger amounts of memory Data alignment and data structure padding Increased stack memory consumption\n\n64-bit systems have a larger amount of memory available to user applications than 32-bit systems. So if a program takes 300 Mbytes on a 32-bit system with 2 Gbytes of memory but needs 400 Mbytes on a 64-bit system with 8 Gbytes of memory, in relative units, the program takes three times less memory on a 64-bit system. The one disadvantage is performance loss. Although 64-bit programs are faster, extracting larger amounts of data from memory might cancel all the advantages and even reduce performance. Transferring data between the memory and microprocessor (cache) is not very cheap.\n\nOne way to reduce memory consumption is to optimize data structures. Another way is to use memory-saving data types. For instance, if we need to store a lot of integer numbers and we know that their values will never exceed UINT_MAX, we may use the type \"unsigned\" instead of \"size t\", as discussed in the next section.\n\nUsing memsize-types in address arithmetic\n\nUsing ptrdiff_t and size_t types in address arithmetic might give you an additional performance gain along with making the code safer. For example, using the type int, whose size differs from the pointer's capacity, as an index results in additional data conversion commands in the binary code. We might have 64-bit code and the pointers' size is 64 bits while the size of int type remains the same - 32 bits.\n\nIt is not easy to give a brief example to show that size_t is better than unsigned. To be impartial, we have to use the compiler's optimizing capabilities. But two variants of the optimized code often get too different to easily demonstrate their difference. We managed to create something like a simple example after six tries. But the sample is far from ideal because instead of the code containing the unnecessary conversions of data types discussed above, it shows that the compiler can build a more efficient code when using size_t. Consider this code, which arranges array items in the reverse order:\n\n<code1.txt> unsigned arraySize; ... for (unsigned i = 0; i < arraySize / 2; i++) { float value = array[i]; array[i] = array[arraySize - i - 1]; array[arraySize - i - 1] = value; }\n\nThe variables \"arraySize\" and \"i\" in the example have the type unsigned. You can easily replace it with size_t and compare a small fragment of assembler code shown in Table 1.\n\narray [arraySize - I - 1] = value;\n\narraySize, i : unsigned\n\narraySize, i : size_t\n\nmov eax, DWORD PTR arraySize$[rsp]\n\nsub eax, r11d\n\nsub r11d, 1\n\nadd eax, -1\n\nmovss DWORD PTR [rbp + rax*4], xmm0\n\n...\n\nmov rax, QWORD PTR arraySize$[rsp]\n\nsub rax, r11\n\nadd r11, 1\n\nmovss DWORD PTR [rdi + rax*4 - 4], xmm0\n\n...\n\nTable 1 - Comparing the 64-bit assembler code fragments using the types unsigned and size_t\n\nThe compiler managed to build a more concise code when using 64-bit registers. We do not want to say that the code created using the type unsigned (column 1) will be slower than the code using the type size_t (column 2). It is difficult to compare the speed of code execution on contemporary processors. But you can see in this example that the compiler built a briefer and faster code when using 64-bit types.\n\nNow let us consider an example showing the advantages of the types ptrdiff_t and size_t from the viewpoint of performance. For the purposes of demonstration, we will take a simple algorithm of calculating the minimum path length.\n\nThe function FindMinPath32 is written in classic 32-bit style with unsigned types. The function FindMinPath64 differs from it only in the way that all the unsigned types in it are replaced with size_t types. There are no other differences! Now let us compare the execution speeds of these two functions (Table 2).\n\nMode and function Function's execution time 1 32-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath32 1 2 32-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath64 1.002 3 64-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath32 0.93 4 64-bit compilation mode. Function FindMinPath64 0.85 Table 2 - The time of executing the functions FindMinPath32 and FindMinPath64\n\nTable 2 shows reduced time relative to the speed of execution of the function FindMinPath32 on a 32-bit system. This table was developed for the purpose of clarity. The operation time of the\n\nFindMinPath32 function in the first line is 1 on a 32-bit system. This represents our baseline as a unit of measurement.\n\nIn the second line, we see that the operation time of the FindMinPath64 function is also 1 on a 32-bit system. No wonder, because the type unsigned coincides with the type size_t on a 32-bit system, and there is no difference between the FindMinPath32 and FindMinPath64 functions. A small deviation (1.002) only indicates a small error in measurements.\n\nIn the third line, we see a performance gain of 7%. We could well expect this result after recompiling the code for a 64-bit system.\n\nThe fourth line is of the most interest for us. The performance gain is 15%. By merely using the type size_t instead of unsigned, the compiler built a more effective code that works even 8% faster!\n\nThis simple and obvious example shows how data that are not equal to the size of the machine word slow down algorithm performance. Mere replacement of the types int and unsigned with ptrdiff_t and size_t may result in a significant performance gain. This result applies first of all to those cases where these data types are used in index arrays, in address arithmetic and to arrange loops.\n\nIntrinsic functions\n\nIntrinsic functions are special system-dependent functions that perform actions that cannot be performed at the C/C++ level of code or that perform these functions much more effectively. Actually, they let you get rid of inline assembler code because it is often undesirable or impossible to use.\n\nPrograms may use intrinsic functions to create faster code due to the lack of overhead expenses on calling common functions. The code size is a bit larger of course. MSDN gives a list of functions that can be replaced with their intrinsic versions. Examples of these are memcpy, strcmp, etc.\n\nBesides automatic replacement of common functions with their intrinsic versions, you may use intrinsic functions explicitly in your code. This might be helpful due to these factors:\n\nInline assembler is not supported by the Visual C++ compiler in the 64-bit mode while intrinsic code is. Intrinsic functions are simpler to use as they do not require knowledge of registers and other similar low-level constructs. Intrinsic functions are updated in compilers while assembler code must be updated manually. The built-in optimizer does not work with assembler code. Intrinsic code is easier to port than assembler code.\n\nUsing intrinsic functions in automatic mode (with the help of the compiler switch) will let you get some percentage of performance gain and using the \"manual\" switch helps even more. That is why using intrinsic functions is a good way to go.\n\nAlignment\n\nData structure alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. It consists of two separate but related issues: data alignment and data structure padding. When a modern computer reads from or writes to a memory address, it will do this in word-sized chunks (e.g., 4-byte chunks on 32-bit systems) or larger. Data alignment means putting the data at a memory offset equal to some multiple of the word size, which increases the system's performance due to the way the CPU handles memory. To align the data, it may be necessary to insert some meaningless bytes between the end of the last data structure and the start of the next, which is data structure padding.\n\nFor example, when the computer's word size is 4 bytes (which is 8 bits on most machines, but could be different on some systems), the data to be read should be at a memory offset that is some multiple of 4. When this is not the case, e.g., the data starts at the 14th byte instead of the 16th byte, then the computer has to read two 4-byte chunks and do some calculation before the requested data has been read, or it may generate an alignment fault. Even though the previous data structure ends at the 13th byte, the next data structure should start at the 16th byte. Two padding bytes are inserted between the two data structures to align the next data structure to the 16th byte.\n\nAlthough data structure alignment is a fundamental issue for all modern computers, many computer languages and computer language implementations handle data alignment automatically\n\nIt is good in some cases to help the compiler by defining the alignment manually to enhance performance. For example, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) data must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary. You may do this in the following way:\n\n// 16-byte aligned data __declspec(align(16)) double init_val[2] = {3.14, 3.14}; // SSE2 movapd instruction _m128d vector_var = __mm_load_pd(init_val); Android Runtime\n\nAndroid Runtime (ART) applications were developed by Google as a replacement of Dalvik. This runtime offers a number of new features that improve performance and smoothness of the Android platform and apps. ART was introduced in Android 4.4 KitKat; in Android 5.0 it will completely replace Dalvik. Unlike Dalvik, ART uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler (at runtime), meaning that ART compiles an application during its installation. As a result, the program executes faster and that improves battery life.\n\nFor backward compatibility, ART uses the same byte code as Dalvik.\n\nIn addition to the potential speed increase, using ART can provide a second important benefit. As ART runs app machine code directly (native execution), it doesn't hit the CPU as hard as just-in-time code compiling on Dalvik. Less CPU usage results in less battery drain, which is a big plus for portable devices in general.\n\nSo why wasn't ART implemented earlier? Let's look at the downsides of Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. First, the generated machine code requires more space than the existing byte code. Second, the code is pre-compiled at install time, so the installation process takes a bit longer time. Finally, it also corresponds to a larger memory footprint at execution time. This means that fewer apps can be run concurrently. When the first Android devices hit the market, memory and storage capacity were significantly smaller and presented a bottleneck for performance. This is the reason why a JIT approach was the preferred option at that time. Today, memory is much cheaper and thus more abundant, even on low-end devices, so ART is a logical step forward.\n\nIn perhaps the most important improvement, ART now compiles your application to native machine code when installed on a user's device. Known as ahead-of-time compilation, you can expect to see large performance gains as the compilers are set for specific architectures (such as ARM, x86, or MIPS). This eliminates the need for just-in-time compilation each time an application is run. Thus it takes more time to install your application, but it will boot faster when launched as many tasks executed at runtime on the Dalvik VM, such as class and method verification, have already taken place.\n\nNext, the ART team worked to optimize the garbage collector (GC). Instead of two pauses totaling about 10ms for each GC in Dalvik, you'll see just one, usually under 2ms. They've also parallelized portions of the GC runs and optimized collection strategies to be aware of device states. For example, a full GC will run only when the phone is locked and responsiveness to user interaction is no longer important. This is a huge improvement for applications that are sensitive to dropping frames. Additionally, future versions of ART will include a compact collector that will move chunks of allocated memory into contiguous blocks to reduce fragmentation and the need to kill older applications to allocate large memory regions.\n\nLastly, ART makes use of an entirely new memory allocator called Rosalloc (runs of slots allocator). Most modern systems use allocators based on Doug Lea's design, which has a single global memory lock. In a multithreaded, object-oriented environment, this interferes with the garbage collector and other memory operations. In Rosalloc, smaller objects common in Java are allocated in a thread-local region without locking and larger objects have their own locks. Thus when your application attempts to allocate memory for a new object, it doesn't have to wait while the garbage collector frees an unrelated region of memory.\n\nCurrently, Dalvik is the default runtime for Android devices and ART is optionally available on a number of Android 4.4 devices, such as Nexus phones, Google Play edition devices, Motorola phones running stock Android, and many other smartphones. ART is currently in development, and seeking developer and user feedback. ART will eventually replace Dalvik runtime once it becomes completely stable. Until then, users with compatible devices can switch from Dalvik to ART if they're interested in trying out this new functionality and experience its performance.\n\nTo switch or enable ART, your device must be running Android 4.4 KitKat and be compatible with ART. You can easily turn on ART runtime from \"Settings\" -> \"Developer options\" -> \"Runtime option\". (Tip: If you can't see Developer options in Settings, then go to \"About phone\", scroll down, and tap the Build number 7 times to enable developer options.) The phone will reboot and start optimizing the apps for ART, which can take around 15-20 minutes, depending on the number of apps installed on your phone. You will also notice an increase in the size of installed apps after enabling ART runtime.\n\nNote: After switching to ART, when you reboot your device for the first time, it will optimize all the apps once again; which is kind of annoying.\n\nAs Dalvik is the default runtime on Android devices, some apps might not work on ART, though, most existing apps are compatible with ART and should work fine. But in case you experience any bugs or app crashes with ART, then it's wise to switch back and stay with ART.\n\nSwitching to ART on devices requires you to know where to find the switching option on the device. Google has hidden it under Settings. Fortunately, there is a trick to enable ART runtime on device that are based on Android 4.4 KitKat.\n\nDisclaimer: Before trying this, you should make a backup of your data. Intel won't be responsible if your device gets bricked (won't turn on regardless of what you try). Try it at your own risk!\n\nRequires Root Don't try if you have WSM Tools installed as they don't support ART.\n\nTo enable ART, carefully follow these steps:\n\nMake sure your device is rooted. Install 'ES File Explorer' from the Play store. Open ES File Explorer, tap the menu icon from top left corner and select Tools. In tools, enable the 'Root Explorer' option and grant full root access to ES explorer when prompted. In ES explorer, open the Device (/) directory from Menu -> Local-> Device. Go to the /data/property folder. Open the persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file as Text and then select ES note editor. Edit the file by selecting the edit option from top right corner. Rename the line from libdvm.so to libart.so Go back to the persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file and select 'Yes' to save the file. Then reboot the phone. The phone will reboot now and start optimizing the apps for ART. It can take time to reboot depending on the number of apps installed on your device.\n\nIn case you want to revert back to Dalvik runtime, simply follow the above steps and rename the text in persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib file to libdvm.so.\n\nConclusion\n\nGoogle has released a 64-bit emulator image for the forthcoming Android L - but only for the Intel x86 chip. The new emulator will allow developers to build or optimize older apps for the upcoming Android L OS and its new 64-bit architecture. Moving to 64-bit increases the addressable memory space, and allows a larger number of registers and a new instructions set for developers, but 64-bit apps aren't necessarily faster.\n\nJava apps automatically gain the benefits of 64-bit because their byte code will be interpreted by the new ART VM which is 64-bit.This also implies that no changes to pure Java apps are necessary. Those built on the Android NDK will need some optimization to include the x86_64 build target. Intel has advice on how to go about porting code that targets ARM to x86/x64. Using the new emulator, developers will only be able to create apps for Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 processor-based chips.\n\nIntel has been providing developers with tools and good system support for Android particularly its Intel\u00ae Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel\u00ae HAXM) and a range of Intel Atom OS images. Many Android programmers regularly test on emulated Intel architecture even though most of their deployment is to ARM devices. As well as the new emulator there is a 64-bit upgrade to the HAXM accelerator which should make using HAXM even more attractive. To quote Intel:\n\n\"This commitment is evident not only in the delivery of the industry's first 64-bit emulator image for Intel architecture, and 64-bit Intel HAXM within the Android L Developer Preview SDK, but also in many other innovations along the way such as the first 64-bit kernel for Android KitKat earlier this year, the 64-bit Android Native Development Kit (NDK), and other 64-bit advancements over the last decade.\"\n\nCould it be that a change to Intel architecture might happen as part of the change from 32-bit mobile to 64-bit mobile?\n\nThe Android SDK includes a virtual mobile device emulator that runs on your computer. The emulator lets you prototype, develop, and test Android applications without using a physical device. The Android emulator mimics all of the hardware and software features of a typical mobile device, except that it cannot place actual phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys, which you can \"press\" using your mouse or keyboard to generate events for your application. It also provides a screen in which your application is displayed, along with any other active Android applications.\n\nTo let you model and test your application more easily, the emulator utilizes Android Virtual Device (AVD) configurations. AVDs let you define certain hardware aspects of your emulated phone and allow you to create many configurations to test many Android platforms and hardware permutations. Once your application is running on the emulator, it can use the services of the Android platform to invoke other applications, access the network, play audio and video, store and retrieve data, notify the user, and render graphical transitions and themes.\n\nRelated Articles and Resources Get information and download Android NDK, Revision 10d here.

Now Facebook's gone a little further with the introduction of a new mobile devices application, Hello.\n\nThe new program was designed by the company's Messenger team but is essentially a calling, caller ID and search app for your phone. Available only on Android phones, the app pulls Facebook data to identify callers - it can do this even if they aren't in your address book, thanks to Facebook's bank of phone numbers - and will let you search for businesses that have put their phone numbers on the social network.\n\nThe Hello announcement came shortly before the company released mixed results for its first-quarter earnings. Facebook reported lighter-than-predicted revenue of $3.54 billion for the quarter versus analyst expectations of $3.56 billion.\n\nThe firm beat analyst predictions for earnings of $.41 per share, by one cent. And the company's focus on mobile has also continued to pay off, with 73 percent of its advertising revenue coming from smartphones and tablets. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg called it a \"good quarter and a good start to the year\" in the company's earnings call with analysts.\n\nBut most of his remarks focused on Facebook's future plans for expansion, including in the world of messaging.\n\nThe introduction of Hello continues a trend Facebook's been exploring for the past couple of years. From the company's 2014 acquistion of WhatsApp, to its purchase of the virtual-reality startup Oculus, or the expansion of its own Facebook Messenger app, many of the company's major moves demonstrate a deep interest in the future of communication via text, voice and video messaging.\n\nNot all of them have borne fruit yet. The Oculus Rift, for example, still isn't on the market. Facebook's attempt to catch up to Snapchat, with an app called Slingshot, has gained almost no traction. But the efforts do show where Facebook's interests lie as its core social network ages.\n\nOf course, it faces fierce competition from the likes of Twitter, Google, Skype, Snapchat and many others. It's a crowded space. But Facebook seems happy to just be in the mix for now, with plans to keep experimenting.\n\nWhen talking about messaging during Wednesday's call, Zuckerberg told analysts that he's happy Facebook has \"evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps\" that allow users to talk to each other in a variety of ways.\n\nFor example, Zuckerberg said that WhatsApp is used more as a text-message replacement for users around the world. Facebook Messenger, on the other hand, is more \"focused on expression,\" he said. He also said he's not interested in unifying the company's many messaging services, preferring to serve these small niches rather than pulling everything together in a one-size-fits-all tool.\n\n\"I think that these are just going to keep on growing, is my expectation and hope,\" he said, \"And we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities.\"", "SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft Corp is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.\n\nMicrosoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.\n\nGetting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.\n\n\"Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,\" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. \"They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.\"\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, executive vice president Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem.\n\nFollow live coverage of Microsoft's Build conference below. Mobile users click here.\n\nThe apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.\n\nMyerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple.\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMicrosoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3% of the global smartphone market.

And for the second time, he defended the move by noting that the institution is not currently regulated by the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn mid-April, the former Fed chairman joined the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel. On Wednesday, he said he would join the Pacific Investment Management Co. -- known as Pimco, the world's biggest bond mutual fund.\n\nMr. Bernanke's new role at two prominent financial institutions has revived concerns about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. The New York Times earlier this month interviewed Mr. Bernanke, who acknowledged the concern:\n\nMr. Bernanke said he was sensitive to the public's anxieties about the \"revolving door\" between Wall Street and Washington and chose to go to Citadel, in part, because it \"is not regulated by the Federal Reserve and I won't be doing lobbying of any sort.\"\n\nMr. Bernanke made a similar argument about Pimco, which is a unit of Allianz SE. In an interview with Reuters, which first reported his Pimco gig, he said \"the Fed does not regulate Pimco or its parent or any other firm that is affiliated with it.\" He said the same applies to Citadel and added, \"I am not going to be involved in any kind of lobbying or any kind of influence with the Fed or Congress or anybody else in the government.\"\n\nHere at Real Time Economics, we documented all the ways that Citadel and the Fed have overlapped in recent years. Although the Fed does not have regulatory responsibility for hedge funds, it had interacted with Citadel repeatedly and views hedge funds as a potential source of systemic risk.\n\nPimco, too, has been identified as a potential source of systemic risk. The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research wrote a report in 2013 that said asset managers -- of which Pimco is one of the world's largest -- could pose risks to the financial system. The report laid out a rationale for the largest asset managers to be declared \"systemically important,\" a designation which would require regulation from the Fed.\n\nPimco was among a group of firms that pushed back against the report. BlackRock Inc., Pimco and Fidelity Investments all criticized the report. Pimco said the report \"reflects a fundamental misconception\" of the industry, and wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting that the report \"not be used as a basis for policymaking or regulation of the asset management industry.\"\n\nWhile the Fed does not regulate Pimco -- and Pimco has actively sought to keep it that way -- Reuters noted that the Fed and Pimco have a history conducting business together during the controversial bailouts of the financial crisis. The New York Fed gave Pimco a contract worth $1 million a month to manage the central bank's commercial-paper funding facility and another contract to monitor the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, known as TALF. The Fed also hired Pimco to help purchase mortgage bonds during its first round of quantitative easing.\n\nIn July 2011, the Government Accountability Office wrote a report that criticized the Fed's handling of these lucrative contracts. The report found that Pimco earned $12.6 million from the Fed for its role with the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and earned $33.6 million for helping with the commercial paper funding facility. The latter contract was awarded to Pimco without competitive bidding, according to the GAO.\n\nAt its peak, the commercial paper facility had more than $348 billion in funds outstanding. The GAO noted in its report that the Fed did not provide timely on-site reviews of Pimco's operations. \"Although Pimco played a key role in administering CPFF program requirements starting in October 2008, [the New York Fed] did not conduct an onsite review of PIMCO's controls until March 2009,\" the GAO wrote.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nPimco Hires Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke As Adviser\n\nHow Citadel and the Fed Crossed Paths Before the Hedge Fund Hired Ben Bernanke\n\nFormer Fed Chief Ben Bernanke to Advise Hedge Fund Citadel\n\nGet WSJ economic analysis delivered to your inbox:\n\nSign up for the WSJ's Grand Central, a daily report on global central banking", "The U.S. Federal Reserve kept it key interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and cooled expectations on coming increases on the heels of a disappointing report on growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nThe gross domestic product, or GDP, rose by annualized rate of just 0.2 per cent in the January to March period, dampened by scaled-back energy drilling and slumping exports as well as a winter wallop.\n\nThe small uptick comes after growth of 2.2 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nEconomists say the weak U.S. report sounds a cautionary note for Canada.\n\n\"While we believe this weakness is temporary, the cautionary note is if softness persists in the U.S. economy, the Canadian economy is really going to struggle through the rest of this year,\" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nApril data on auto sales and manufacturing for the U.S. and Canada will be released on Friday, with monthly employment reports for both countries coming the following week.\n\nU.S. employment numbers for March showed a softer-than-expected increase of 126,000 jobs.\n\nEconomists will be watching closely to determine if the labour market report was a one-month fluke or the start of a slower trend for the U.S. economy, Porter said.\n\n\"All eyes are going to be on the spring data for the U.S.\"\n\nMORE AT THESTAR.COM\n\nOECD slashes forecast for Canadian economy, blaming oil price declines\n\nBank of Canada's rosy economic outlook called \"pure fantasy\"\n\nPolicymakers with the U.S. Fed, as the central bank is known, said the economy weakened partly due to reasons that will fade.\n\n\"Economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors,\" the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday in Washington. \"The pace of job gains moderated,\" it said, and \"underutilization of labour resources was little changed.\"\n\nMost economists had been expecting the figures from the U.S. Commerce Department to show a 1 per cent gain, according to Bloomberg.\n\nCorporate fixed investment fell as oil companies slashed their spending in response to the plunge in the price of crude oil.

Premiums in this segment stood at Sh162 billion last year, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of the country's GDP.\n\nThis signals significant growth opportunity in the coming years in the context of the growing middle class and increased awareness of the role of insurance in hedging risks.\n\n\"The life insurance market in Kenya is registering 20 per cent year-on-year growth but our sector still represents a tiny fraction of the country's rapidly expanding economy,\" said William Maara, the managing director of Barclays Life.", "Guess who's getting into the structured product annuity game?\n\nIt's almost May, and annuity geeks know what that means: the new variable annuity contract filings are here.\n\nIn preparation for spring product releases, life insurers spend the first quarter posting new variable annuity contracts with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings themselves give some indication as to carriers' thoughts on what the next big product might be. See here and here for past product releases.\n\nThus far, carriers' test kitchens haven't been very busy. \"It looked like a very quiet quarter,\" John McCarthy, senior product manager of wealth management products at Morningstar Inc., said. \"There aren't a ton of new contracts or benefits.\"\n\nFilings have been trending downward since the fourth quarter last year, and that continued through the first quarter. It reflects the difficulties carriers face as interest rates remain low.\n\n\"A lot of changes have already been done on the product management side,\" Mr. McCarthy said. \"At the same time, firms have pivoted into the investment-only variable annuity area. Many of those filings are done, and there isn't much insurers can do on the living benefits side until interest rates rebound.\"\n\nNevertheless, there are still a few notable releases out there. Don't forget that earlier this spring MetLife announced its return to the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits game.\n\nHYBRIDS ARE BACK\n\nRemember the structured product or hybrid annuity? It's back. This time, Voya -- once known as ING -- is launching its PotentialPLUS annuity, which it describes as a \"deferred combination variable, indexed and fixed annuity contract.\"\n\nGo here for a look at the May 1 prospectus filing with the SEC.\n\nConsider the way structured product annuities generally operate. Clients can receive returns that are linked to an index but subject to a cap that's determined periodically. Downward movement in the index is buffered to a certain extent; carriers can shield clients from a portion of the loss.\n\nThe secret ingredient is options: insurers use them to duplicate the performance of the index and to buffer some downside risk.\n\nThe Voya product uses four indexes: The MSCI EAFE, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000 and the S&P 500. All have a maximum buffer of 10%, and all are subject to a one-year segment term -- the period for which the index credit is calculated and the cap rate is guaranteed.\n\nAside from the indexing options, Voya also offers a subaccount, which is called the Voya Liquid Assets portfolio. This is the variable part of the product. Clients also have access to a fixed account in the annuity, which offers a fixed rate of interest, but this account is really a short-term vehicle where money is held until it's transferred to the subaccount or to the indexed options.\n\nThis annuity has a seven-year surrender period, with charges starting at 8% and declining to zero at year eight.\n\nAXA's LATEST UPDATES\n\nIn a prospectus dated May 1, AXA rolled out the carpet for its Retirement Cornerstone Series 15.0. It's an update from the 13.0 version.\n\nA notable difference, Mr. McCarthy points out, is the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit Multi-Year Lock, newly available on Series 15.0.\n\nPer the filing with the SEC, the benefit base on the GMIB -- which is used to calculate lifetime income -- can increase with a step-up under one of two formulas.\n\nThere's the two-year lock, where the benefit base increases each year to equal the purchase payments the client puts into the contract, compounded by at least 4% each year.\n\nThe multi-year lock increases the benefit base annually so that it equals purchase payments compounded by a minimum of 3% each year. This \"lock\" lasts for the length of the surrender period. The maximum compounding factor for both \"lock\" options is 8%. The rate used will either be the lock-in rate, or a rate that AXA derives from a formula involving the 10-year Treasury rate.\n\nAnother notable feature AXA's adding to its Retirement Cornerstone VA is its RMD Wealth Guard guaranteed minimum death benefit. Clients who use this GMDB will be able to take required minimum distributions after age 70.5 without depleting the amount that will be left to beneficiaries.\n\nALLIIANZ'S NEW INVESTMENT OPTIONS\n\nEarlier this week, Allianz announced it would add a pair of new investment options to new VA business and its in-force Allianz Vision and Connections variable annuities. Both choices protect clients from market volatility.\n\nThe first is the AZL MVP DFA multi-strategy fund, which grants exposure to a range of domestic large and small cap equities, as well as international and emerging markets equities and global fixed income. What's key here is that the fund uses a volatility management strategy when the markets become rocky.\n\nThe second is the RCM Dynamic Multi-Asset Plus VIT portfolio, which adjusts its equity allocation upward when markets are favorable and downward when things become risky. The allocation can go as high as 65% when markets are faring well, and decrease as low as 10% in difficult times, according to Allianz.", "Allianz Global Investors' Kunal Ghosh has warned of an imminent correction in the Indian equity market after a post-election bull run.\n\nThe manager of the \u00a3271m Allianz BRIC Stars fund has some 27% of his portfolio in Indian stocks, helping him benefit from the sharp rise in the Sensex following the election of Narendra Modi as prime minister last May.\n\nOver the past 12 months, India's main equity index is up 23%, building on the stronger gains made in the run-up to the election.\n\nHowever, Ghosh (pictured) suggested the market is now likely to hit a soft patch: \"In the next six months, I would be careful of India as, after so much success, you are going to find a consolidation.\"\n\nHe added the changing structure of the Indian economy, prompted by Modi's first budget, could temporarily slow corporate earnings growth.\n\n\"Some 64% of Indian GDP is consumption driven, but the budget did not mention that part of the economy. The economy is shifting gears towards infrastructure. When you change gears, the car slows down.\"\n\nSunil Asani, manager of the top-performing Matthews Asia India fund, told Investment Week last month that reforms are \"not happening as fast as people had hoped\", describing them as incremental rather than substantial.\n\nBoth he and Ghosh, however, view the country as a reliable long-term pick for investors as Modi's reforms gradually have a positive impact the economy.\n\nGhosh said: \"If you want a country you can put money into for ten years and ignore, I would pick India. I think it will disappoint this year as earnings are not yet benefitting from the capex going into infrastructure but, over three years and longer, India will perform.\"\n\nThe Allianz fund's largest holding is one of India's most globalised businesses, outsourcing and solutions provider Infosys, which makes up 6% of the portfolio.\n\nGhosh became the manager of BRIC Stars in late 2013 and, under his management, performance has turned around after a disappointing period: the fund returned 26% over the year to 22 April, compared with a three-year return of 17%, according to FE.\n\nOne of Ghosh's key changes has been to take advantage of the fund's geographic flexibility to look outside the BRIC countries for ideas.\n\nUp to a third of its assets can be invested outside Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and Ghosh has allocated 8.5% and 7.8% to Korea and Taiwan, respectively.\n\nHe remains bearish on some parts of his asset class despite a strong start to 2014. \"Russia will always be Russia. We will never be bullish on it,\" he said.", "The Corporate Learning Improvement Process (CLIP) is a unique accreditation run by EFMD that focuses on identifying the key factors that determine quality in the design and functioning of corporate universities and learning organisations.\n\nEFMD is delighted to announce that Repsol has recently received CLIP accreditation and joins the CLIP community which also includes: Akademie Deutscher Genossenschaften ADG; Alcatel-Lucent; Allianz SE; ArcelorMittal; BBVA - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria; EDF Group; Gas Natural Fenosa; GDF SUEZ University; Grupo Santander; Mazars University; MLP Finanzdienstleistungen AG; Novartis International AG; PSA Peugeot Citron; Siemens AG; Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd and UniCredit Group.\n\n\"We feel very proud to have been welcomed into the CLIP community, it has been a great experience.

A hurler.\n\nKildare bounced back from relegation last year to win the Christy Ring and have since won six from six to win Division 2B, securing promotion and beating Meath in the final.\n\nThey are captained by Eanna O'Neill, 24, a strength and conditioning student at Limerick IT (based on their Thurles campus) who has rubbed shoulders with hurlers of all hues.\n\nO'Neill has played in an LIT Fitzgibbon Cup team that included Tony Kelly and was managed by Davy Fitzgerald, a man, he says, who didn't care where you were from as long as you could do the business on the field.\n\nKildare and 19 other counties - including last year's beaten Christy Ring finalists Kerry, who have since beaten Antrim to earn a place in Division 1B next year - have an early championship start this Saturday.\n\nKildare start their title defence with a tricky trip to London and one boost for those vying for the Ring, Rackard and Meagher Cups is that TG4 will show all three finals for the first time next month.\n\nYet it still feels like their competitions are rushed through before the main event starts.\n\nFour rounds will take place over the next four weekends before a week's break ahead of the finals on June 6 and they're not the only ones with a hectic schedule. The first round of Leinster's round-robin preliminary group also takes place this Sunday, at the exact same time as the Allianz HL Division 1 final is live on TV.\n\nLast summer, a week after winning their trophy, Kildare had to play Westmeath for a place in Leinster's round robin this season.\n\n\"That came as an awful disappointment,\" admits the Coill Dubh wing-back.\n\n\"We thought the GAA might have re-fixed it or had a look at it. To ask boys to play six weeks in a row is an awful toll on the body.\n\n\"We had to celebrate winning the Christy Ring because if we held it off to a week later and lost we'd have had nothing worth celebrating, we'd have been on a downer,\" he explained. \"It was also down in Westmeath so we were fighting an uphill battle from the start.\"\n\nThat play-off, at least, has been scrapped. This year's Christy Ring winners will automatically join Leinster in 2016, a major carrot for the defending champions, but O'Neill, like many colleagues, remains puzzled by the undue haste to get their games out of the way.\n\n\"We train the exact same as any other inter-county panel,\" he stresses. \"We set up in October or November, put in all the ground work but then it's all over five or six weeks into the summer, when you're only getting into the good weather, and good ground, for hurling.\"", "David Tan has a reminder for those scenting blood in euro-area bonds: European Central Bank purchases have barely gotten started.\n\nLed by President Mario Draghi, the ECB is mopping up 60 billion euros ($67 billion) of debt a month and plans to continue the purchases through September next year. The force of the buying may yet pull yields lower, according to Tan, the London-based head of rates at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nThat's a deterrent for traders betting this week's bond-market selloff, which sent German yields up by the most since August 2013, spells an end to record-low borrowing costs in the region. Among those agitating for a slump in bond prices are DoubleLine Capital LP's Jeffrey Gundlach, who said he's considering making an amplified bet against short-dated notes, and Janus Capital's Bill Gross, who said bunds were the \"short of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"I respect what they say, but against that you've got the ECB on the other side of the trade,\" said Tan, whose company oversees $1.7 trillion. \"We're reluctant to say that we have definitely seen the low in yields.\"\n\nGerman 10-year yields, the region's benchmark, rose 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, this week to 0.33 percent at 10:28 a.m. London time on Thursday. And apart from Greece, no market has been spared: Spain's five-year note yield jumped seven basis points to 0.65 percent while France's 30-year yield leaped 26 basis points to 1.32 percent.\n\nInflation Stirs\n\nLarge though the moves have been, Germany's 10-year yield remained lower than the close on March 6, the last trading day before the ECB began buying government securities as part of its expanded quantitative-easing program. While the yield is up from the record low of 0.049 percent set April 17, it's almost 1.5 percentage points below the five-year average. Germany's two-year note yield was minus 0.24 percent.\n\nOne argument for higher yields is the potential for price growth to revive in the euro area, eroding the value of fixed payments on bonds. Data released Wednesday showed the annualized rate of German inflation rose to 0.3 percent this month from 0.1 percent in March, based on European Union-harmonized data.\n\nEuro-area consumer prices stagnated in April after falling for four straight months, a report showed on Thursday, in line with estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The ECB's target is for inflation to be just under 2 percent.\n\n'Still Constructive'\n\n\"We still think that in Europe at least, we're not going to have a dramatic turn on in inflation, and that the ECB buying should continue to dominate,\" said Bert Lourenco, the London-based head of Europe, Middle East, and Africa rates research at HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe's largest lender. \"Longer term, we're still constructive\" on euro-area bonds, he said.\n\nNot everyone shares his view. Gundlach discussed potential returns on a bet against German notes in a Bloomberg Television interview on April 28. \"You talk about something that has horrible risk-reward characteristics, it's these negative interest rates\" on European bonds, he said.\n\nAllianz Global Investors, which manages 412 billion euros, sees euro-area yields following their U.S. peers higher as the Federal Reserve moves closer to raising interest rates, though ECB purchases will moderate the move.\n\nTreasury Spread\n\n\"We expect yields to edge up in the coming months,\" said Stefan Hofrichter, head of global economics and strategy for Allianz Global in Frankfurt. \"Given the quantitative-easing policy of the ECB we have not implemented strong duration bets but we may consider changing it at this juncture.\"\n\nU.S. 10-year notes yielded 173 basis points more than similar-maturity German bonds on Wednesday. The five-year average is 62 basis points.\n\nFor JPMorgan Asset Management's Tan, the ECB's purchases will continue to weigh on bond yields until there are clearer signs of economic growth in Europe.\n\n\"Nobody thinks that 10-year German yields should be at 25 basis points in the long term,\" he said. \"In order to call the bottom, we do need to see a bit more evidence on inflation and inflation expectations as well as growth.\"", "AUSTRALIAN Olympics boss John Coates said yesterday he was astounded the Baird government was \u00adquestioning whether to \u00adinvest further in Homebush's Olympic stadium.\n\n\"I just can't believe we're even talking about whether we need to invest in improving and maintaining the Olympic stadium,'' Mr Coates, the International Olympic Committee vice-president, told The Daily Telegraph.\n\nMr Coates spoke out during a tour of Sydney Olympic Park with IOC president Thomas Bach, Premier Mike Baird and Olympic swimming champion Susie O'Neill. \"It was the heart of the Sydney Olympics; where Cathy Freeman won her gold,'' he said.\n\nMr Coates said it was critical Sydney continued to \u00adinvest in its 80,000-seat \u00adstadium to ensure it could compete against Melbourne and attract the biggest sports events.\n\nThe visit by Mr Bach came as the Baird government \u00adfinalises how to share $600 million in funding between the Olympics venue, now known as ANZ Stadium, Moore Park's outdated Allianz Stadium and Parramatta's Pirtek Stadium.\n\nIt has committed to spending at least half of the $600 million modernising Allianz, but Sport Minister Stuart Ayres is believed to favour building a new 65,000-seat venue at Moore Park rather than spending significant funds at ANZ.\n\nAfter watching a replay of Freeman's victorious 400m run on ANZ's big screen yesterday, Mr Baird vowed the stadium would always be an important part of Sydney's sporting landscape under his government. But he declined to comment further on the funding battle.\n\nMr Baird also told Mr Bach the city was ready to stage another Olympics \"if you ever get into a situation where you need the Olympics to be transferred\"."], "2015-05-01": ["(Bloomberg) -- Swiss Re AG, the world's second-biggest reinsurer, said first-quarter profit rose 17 percent helped by higher income from life and health reinsurance and the Admin Re division.\n\nNet income advanced to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period, the Zurich-based reinsurer said in a statement Thursday. That beat the $971 million average estimate of 8 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nSwiss Re shares climbed to 96.95 Swiss francs in Zurich trading on April 13, the highest since 2007, fueled by strong payouts to investors via special dividends and a planned buyback of stock worth as much as 1 billion francs ($1.1 billion). Following the dividend payment for last year, the shares have since fallen 14 percent to 83.30 francs by the close of trading in Zurich yesterday.\n\nEarnings at the life and health reinsurance unit increased to $277 million from $64 million a year ago, driven by realized gains on sales of securities and foreign exchange re- measurement.\n\nSwiss Re's Admin Re unit, which buys and manages closed books of life and health insurance, increased net income to $206 million from $48 million, boosted by returns from sales of government bonds, favorable investment market performance in the U.K. and tax credits.

She hammered them for their deadly silence on Christian persecution: \"I ask myself where is the left, with a capital L?\" She notes that its reticence is occurring \"in front of the most terrible of crimes against the weakest -- the massacres of Christians whose blood is shed in many parts of the world.\"\n\nThe Italian leftist doesn't mince words. \"Why have I not received any petition to sign, though I receive many of varied kinds? Why has no one promoted, if not a public protest, a sit-in, or a meeting? I hear no slogans for persecuted Christians, nor do I get documents or petitions on the issue.\"\n\nThough she is wrong to praise the left for their \"defense of the weakest\" (e.g., they lead the fight to kill the unborn) she is right to say that \"with few exceptions, never does the left express pain or horror for the men and women who die because of their faith.\"\n\nThe answer to Annunziata's question is straightforward: The left doesn't care about Christian persecution because it doesn't care about Christians. This is an understatement: it would be more accurate to say it has an animus against Christianity.\n\nWhy the hostility? Sexuality, pure and simple. It wants a no-holds-barred libertine understanding of sexuality. As such, it rightly identifies Christianity, especially Catholicism, as a bulwark to its advancement. Ironically, it is the West's rejection of Catholicism's sexual ethics, which prizes restraint, that is responsible for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nChristians are getting it at home as well as abroad. While Muslim barbarians are murdering Christians abroad, without any push back from the left, left-wing Christian bashers at home are justifying anti-Christian bigotry. Consider the rants of Jeffrey Tayler, who writes for Salon.\n\nTayler's most recent article on this subject is a congratulatory statement made on behalf of his hero, Bill Maher. If bigotry were against the law, Maher would have been jailed long ago. Tayler likes Maher's brand of anti-Catholic humor, which is why he wants more of it. Earlier this year he implored readers to \"offend religion more.\"\n\nIt is one thing to be a proud bigot, quite another to be an historical dunce. Anyone who thinks that the world's first totalitarians, namely, the architects of the French Revolution, are responsible for freedom of speech and rule of law is badly educated. If it weren't for the Catholic Church, which gave us the world's first universities and the world's first successful opposition to tyranny, haters such as Tayler wouldn't enjoy the protections they do.\n\nThe left has spawned every secular totalitarian regime in history, and Islam is responsible for every religious totalitarian movement the world has seen. Conservatives and Christians, by contrast, have never bequeathed a single political, economic, social, and cultural dictatorship.\n\nConservatism, as championed by Edmund Burke, believes in a small role for government; and Christianity, as championed by Catholicism, believes in natural law and natural rights. Both of these ideas are as anathema to the left as they are to totalitarianism.\n\nThat is why Hitler chose to govern the National Socialist Party; he ruled from the left. Moreover, from their crusades against Christianity in the 20th century -- led by Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot -- to their current tolerance for Islamist terrorism -- the left has never been the friend of liberty. Just the opposite.\n\nWhat motivates left-wing totalitarianism, as I point out in my new book, \"The Catholic Advantage: Why Health, Happiness, and Heaven Await the Faithful,\" is utopianism. The left rejects nature, and nature's God, as well as Original Sin, which is why it is so confident about reconstructing human nature and setting everything right.\n\nBut in reality there is no such thing as heaven on earth. In fact, when the left gets control, it delivers nothing but poverty and genocide. To be idealistic is admirable; to be utopian is dangerous.\n\nWe are lucky to have Lucia Annunziata's voice heard.

We had left the lights on for self-determination in South Vietnam more than two years earlier in January 1973 when our combat troops were pulled out in compliance with the Paris Peace Accords.\n\nAlthough our country had won the war against communist aggression and promised aid to the South, we stood by when the North invaded. The freedom for which we sacrificed more than 58,000 lives and countless treasure was lost. The Vietnamese who had supported us were executed or hauled off to reeducation camps.\n\nI could only imagine the grief felt by the families and friends of the fallen, including several friends and my sister's fianc\u00e9, who was killed at DaNang in 1972.\n\nHad we done the same in South Korea, that entire nation would be under the rule of a dictator who routinely starves his citizens to support his Stalinist regime while exporting nuclear technology to nations hostile to us.\n\nAlthough the most visible conflict of the time, Vietnam was only one player on the stage of the world-wide competition between totalitarianism and democracy.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and China, though not always allies, held themselves up as the future of mankind. Communism was supposed to raise man to his highest level of cooperation and production with the state as his god. In 1991, the USSR, unable to compete economically, politically and militarily with the West, collapsed.\n\nReduced to its simplest polar opposites, the conflict over the Vietnam War could be characterized in chants of \"Give peace a chance,\" and the Domino Theory.\n\nThe first noted that the Vietnamese had been fighting for their independence since before World War II against a number of colonial powers, including the Japanese and the French. We were only the latest and should quit the field.\n\nThe Domino Theory posited that communism's stated goal was to pull one nation after another into the socialist orbit. The USSR controlled large portions of Europe in satellite states it occupied during WWII and had tried to extend its nuclear presence into Cuba in 1962.\n\nCommunist forces were moving throughout Southeast Asia in wars of \"liberation.\" Of course, the revolution's goal was always to install a one-party system that permitted no competition.\n\nCambodia fell to the communist Khmer Rouge in April 1975, as the Vietnamese communists completed their choke hold on Saigon. Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot methodically exterminated two million of his countrymen, a full 20 percent of the population, to weed out intellectuals and professionals who might pose a threat to absolute rule. People were forced from cities and towns into the countryside to remake society. Men, women and children who weren't shot outright died of forced labor and starvation.\n\nA decade earlier China's Mao Tse Tung had unleashed a Cultural Revolution on his people that targeted intellectuals and others who challenged his grip on power. Millions died to preserve one man's power and ego.\n\nThe history of that era is still being written by political scientists. It was a time of intense competition between political systems based on dictatorship and individual freedom.\n\nWhile people may disagree about the implications of Vietnam, those who answered the nation's call to serve during that tumultuous era did so admirably and are increasingly recognized for their role in a conflict we entered a half-century ago. It's said there are nearly 10 times as many people who claim to be Vietnam veterans than who actually served.\n\nVietnam veterans know the price of freedom. We applaud our current veterans and their families who are fighting for the same principles against today's political and religious dictators.\n\nDavid Skocik is public affairs officer of the Delaware Council, Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\nCONNECT 1 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1zqigI2", "Story highlightsSouth Korean lawmaker quotes intelligence officials as saying Kim Jong Un countenances no disagreementOfficial reportedly executed for expressing dissatisfaction with forestry programFour member of Unhasu Orchestra also reportedly executed\n\n(CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is continuing to rule with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year, according to an assessment by South Korean intelligence agents, a lawmaker who attended a closed briefing said.\n\nShin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the executions.

In addition to his celebrated novels \"The Plague,\" \"The Stranger,\" and the posthumously published but still quite good \"The First Man,\" Camus's most anthologized short story, \"The Guest,\" is also set in Algeria.\n\nScreenwriter-director David Oelhoffen thoughtfully but not entirely faithfully adapts Camus's story as \"Far From Men,\" which opens this May 1 in New York, following its U.S. premiere at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nDaru is a former military officer trying to make amends for his mysterious past by serving as a school teacher in a remote village. The meditative life seems to suit him, but it will be rudely interrupted by Balducci, the gendarme.\n\nWhether he wants to or not, Daru has been tasked with escorting Balducci's Algerian prisoner to the nearest French outpost in Tinguit, where he will likely be executed.\n\nThat night, Daru makes it clear to the man named Mohamed that he is welcome to escape at any time. However, the admitted murderer seems perversely intent on facing French justice. He does indeed have his reasons, (which constitute some unusually smart writing on Oelhoffen's part).\n\nUnfortunately, Mohamed's family did not have the blood money to buy peace after he justifiably killed his cousin. As a result, Daru will find himself in the middle of an intra-family feud, as well as increasingly violent uprising led by many of his former Algerian army colleagues.\n\nFortunately, Daru is a crack shot with a rifle, because he will have to shoot his way out of a lot of trouble.\n\nEssentially, Oelhoffen trades the icy cold irony of the Camus story for the tragic sweep of a revisionist Algerian Western.

It critically engages with a lot of hot button issues, including colonialism and tribalism, but never at the expense of its lean and mean narrative.\n\nVisually striking and tightly disciplined, \"Far From Men\" is recommended for fans of Mortensen and historical drama at the Cinema Village, following hard on the heels of its well-received screenings at this year's Tribeca Film Festival.", "Peter Dan (LIU): Evil in Familiar Forms: Anti-Semitism, Racism, Totalitarianism, Religious Extremism.

Although the tenants of practicing irregular warfare can be unnerving, this is most definitely not a military grab of the American Southwest.\n\nThis is another type of war, new in its intensity, ancient in its origin -- war by guerrillas, subversives, insurgents, assassins, war by ambush instead of by combat; by infiltration, instead of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him...It requires in those situations where we must counter it...a whole new kind of strategy, a wholly different kind of force, and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training.\n\n-- President John F. Kennedy describing irregular warfare\n\nNote: You can read all about the tenants of irregular warfare here.\n\nI have always found it sad that out of all the people who discuss conspiracy theories, the ones with the most extreme views usually get the biggest soapbox. This puts other researchers on the sidelines, and once they have the conspiracy theorists have an impressionable audience, it is hazardous to try and debunk any of it. Thus, every light in the sky is a CIA drone or a spaceship, and every train loaded with US Army armor is part of a grand plan to send 300 million Americans to internment camps and impose martial law, which is obviously the first step to totalitarian rule.\n\nI can't deny that Operation Jade Helm sets up a ripe canvas for which conspiracy theorists can paint their biggest nightmare scenarios. In reality, it is just another exercise in a never ending list of DoD and homeland security drills that deal with everything from huge earthquakes and multi-national air wars to counter-terrorism offensives and zombie infestations . Yet even the Texas Governor's office is getting on the conspiracy theory bandwagon to some extent, commanding the Texas National Guard to keep close tabs on the exercise as some constituents are demanding.\n\nJade Helm '15 will take place in seven states and specifically near about 17 different population areas. The U.S. Army Green Berets, U.S. Navy SEALS, U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, USMC Marine Special Operations Command, USMC Marine Expeditionary Units, the 82nd Airborne Division and civilian inter-agency partners will all take part in the super-sized exercise. Jade Helm will run for eight weeks, from July into August.\n\nYou can read the DoD's brief on Jade Helm's Texas operations here. It is fairly straight forward and nothing really that strange, aside from the fact that its map spans across the American southwest and into Texas. Within the narrative of this exercise, different states have different levels of affiliation. Just like in the real world, some of these states can be relatively neutral while still sympathizing with one of the major belligerents. This is a key part of irregular warfare, identifying which indigenous forces you can work with and assessing how hard it will be to make that happen.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the states are named as enemy, hostile or neutral based on the totally fictional scenario dreamed up for training purposes. So no, Texas and Utah are not considered the bad guys within the DoD, far from it. The fictional naming of different geographical regions as enemy or friend is a tenant of military scenario training dating back many, many decades.\n\nThe large and diverse geography that the exercise spans allows planners to create uniquely scripted fictional cultures and affiliations of each state within it, creating an overall very complex irregular warfare situation, with many nuances to account for. This large geographical area also allows for unique logistical challenges that crews tasked with transporting special operations forces around the theater cannot get when an exercise is contained in a few small military operating areas.\n\nInstead of being locked in a small geographical 'box,' which could be traversed by an aircraft quickly, flying long distances over diverse terrain is a much more true to real combat. This can include infiltrating deep behind 'enemy lines' to meet with an indigenous group of fighters operating high up in the snowy peaks of Utah, where the real battle is earning their leader's trust, not the actual fighting itself. And yes, this is something units like the Green Berets practice regularly and in a very elaborate fashion.\n\nAnother mission may see a unit fly hundreds of miles to execute a low-level infiltration and assault on an insurgent training camp located in the hot and high mountains of southern California, or being dropped into a frigid lake in Idaho to approach their target by small boat. Simply put, the tyranny of distance is an enemy all itself. Fighting a mock war on a realistic scale, and in diverse environments, will push our troops and their gear to the max.\n\nAdditionally, the exercise's large map allows for a rapidly changing geopolitical storyline, one that is much more complex and fluid than the traditional X-stan vs Y-stan scenarios that often dominate simpler exercises. Just as one state's allegiance may be swayed, another's may go the other direction, or even get invaded by the enemy. You cannot simulate this complex of a storyline using military operating area or even a portion of a single state.\n\nThe DoD also came right out and said why they chose Texas for the core part of the exercise, as they have found the state's populace is very understanding when it comes to the need to train US military units in realistic conditions and thus more forgiving of any peculiar occurrences or disruptions caused by an exercise.\n\nThe truth is that the special ops community has a relatively poor record when it comes to subtly exposing their peculiar trade to the public during very conspicuous exercises. It seems like every year or so a local population goes nuts over the seemingly sudden appearance of black helicopters, with commandos hanging out the side, landing on top of high rises and zooming along at night in tight formations with only one helicopter having its lights on.\n\nThis actually happened here in Portland, Oregon in 2008. The announcement of the exercise, which saw the 160th SOAR MH-6 Littlebirds and Navy SEALs training over downtown Portland, only came an hour before the missions began. Those in the small aircraft photography and spotting community in the area were well aware of the MH-6s presence but the public was not. Long story short, black helicopters and unmarked commandos were the top story for three nights straight on the local news. After just a couple days the exercise had to be moved entirely even though the populace was fully aware they were just SEALs training for urban operations and the same training has been conducted all around the country. Apparently seeing exercises like this in real life is more disconcerting than it is in film.\n\nThese same types of occurrences, of which nothing was secret, has happened around the US year after year. Each time the 'black helicopter' community and conspiracy theorists go nuts. The reality is that these units are just trying to get the unique training that only dense urban environments provide. To them it is just another day on the job, to some of the public they may as well be mutilating cows.\n\nStill, this underlines how poorly SOCOM is at preparing the public for even being in the very proximity of their unique and often visually spectacular training. But then again, public affairs is not the command's strong suit as the community prides itself on being silent warriors and keeping everything out of sight and out of mind unless otherwise directed.\n\nRegardless of the SOCOM's track record when it comes to spooking people with its urban exercises, there has been some attempts at explaining Jade Helm to the masses. Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria, a US Army Special Operations Command spokesman, recently described the need for the exercise to the Washington Post in the following email excerpt:\n\n\"The nature of warfare is always changing and U.S. Army Special Operations Command's mission is to make certain the Army's various Special Operations Forces are trained, equipped and organized to successfully conduct worldwide special operations in support of our nation's interests... Training exercise Jade Helm is going to assist our Special Operations Soldiers and leadership in refining the skills needed against an ever changing foreign threat.\"\n\nJust as Col. Lastoria states, the threat towards US interests and national security are indeed changing. When it comes to the breadth of this particular exercise, it could very likely be something of a response to Russia's use of multiple layers of irregular warfare during its invasion of Crimea and their ongoing proxy war in eastern Ukraine. During the conflict, everything from unmarked Russian paratroopers and aircraft, to white half empty trucks containing 'humanitarian aid,' along with heavily arming local militias, have been used to seize Crimea and create widespread instability in Eastern Ukraine. All the while Russia has denied and then admitted involvement, just to deny their involvement again.\n\nIf you look at a map surrounding Ukraine, it looks somewhat similar to the diversity of alliances and informal geopolitical affinities as what can be found in the scenario map of Operation Jade Helm. This training event gets our forces ready for irregular warfare on a large scale, and Eastern Europe is a very clear contingency operation right now whether we like to admit it or not.\n\nSome of the key elements disclosed in the DoD's brief on the Texas portion of the operation include soldiers openly carrying weapons with blank ammunition and the fact that \"some individuals may conduct suspicious activities designed to prepare them for complex environments overseas.\" The truth of the matter is that these exercises will go down with the full knowledge of local law enforcement, those not wearing uniform will have yellow armbands on, and the total number of players involved in urban area operations is stated to be around 65, with two or three Humvees and one night of helicopter activity. The rest of the exercise will be held on private land or in military operating areas with a total of 1,200 personnel, including support and administrative facilitators, taking part in the exercise Texas wide. This is hardly an invasion force of America's second largest (and probably most heavily armed) state.\n\nIt is understandable how the growing reach of the Federal Government may be unsettling to some, but as long as an exercise like this one does not interfere with citizens civil liberties, they should go ahead as planned. Providing our special forces operators with the very best training possible is critical to national security. This is especially true considering the new geopolitical realities of the world and that Putin has a serious affinity to using irregular warfare in a blatant and large-scale way. Often, irregular warfare needs to be fought with irregular warfare and other highly specialized tactics, such as intensive psychological operations and unique forms of intelligence gathering. These techniques cannot be practiced in a text book or on a computer.\n\nJade Elm may seem puzzling at first glance, and it should as its goals support irregular warfare training, but in reality it is just another military training event and a clearly valuable and topical one at that. So don't expect to be rounded up and hauled off in an armored bus with blacked out windows.", "The so-called charity group, the Clinton Foundation, is being examined by most journalists as a political story when a few reporters and commentators believe it should be investigated as a criminal enterprise run by two popular politicians -- former President Bill Clinton and former Obama Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- well known for their mendacity. One of the latest revelations could be characterized as a conspiracy to enrich the Clintons, according to news outlets and watchdog groups on Tuesday.\n\nThe renowned international investment banking firm, the Goldman Sachs Group, reportedly gave former President Bill Clinton a $200,000 check for a speech in 2011, just months prior to the firm's executives lobbying the U.S. Department of State, then headed by globe-trotting Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to news reports and a public-interest watchdog group -- specializing in government corruption -- on Tuesday.\n\nWithin 72 hours of Bill Clinton accepting Goldman's generous payment for a speech in New York City, Hillary Clinton speaking at the State Department's headquarters in Washington couldn't praise Goldman Sachs enough for that firm's assistance in creating a foreign exchange student program to help increase the number of U.S. university students who would study in China.\n\n\"Goldman Sachs is like many other American-based companies now pushing a global economy message and running propaganda films disguised as television commercials. The truth is these multi-national firms owe no allegiance to the United States. To them, the U.S. is merely the 'home office,'\" said former law enforcement official and corporate security director Charles Keilsen. \"Their goal just may be to have impressionable American kids indoctrinated with China's economic philosophy which combines a market-economy with a totalitarian -- and oppressive -- political system,\" Keilsen added.\n\nDuring Hillary Clinton's service as the nation's top diplomat, her husband's paid speeches for foreign entities, foreign countries, and multi-national corporations while she was in charge of the State Department required the approval of department officials. \"Bill Clinton's 2011 speech to a conference full of Goldman clients gathered in New York gained the blessing of State Department officials,\" according to the top government watchdog group, Judicial Watch.\n\nThis latest revelation of Bill Clinton being paid a six-figure bonanza from Goldman Sachs for one of his longwinded speeches followed by the investment banking firm seeking business with a department run by the speaker's wife has led many to intensify their investigation of the Clinton family's shenanigans for a charity that spends only about $9 million out of $140 million donated to their foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, as expected, officials from the Goldman Sacks deny any wrongdoing: \"Any linkage between a speech for clients and the outcome of the Budget Control Act is preposterous,\" said a Goldman spokesman, Andrew Williams, who previously served as a deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration. Despite Goldman's lobbying records, Williams asserted: \"We did not lobby the State Department on budget issues, nor did we ask anyone else to.\"\n\n\"The news media for the most part is actually aiding and abetting an arguably 'criminal enterprise and conspiracy\" involving the Clinton dynasty. Any police detective, who has investigated crime organizations such as La Cosa Nostra, will tell you that for there to be a criminal conspiracy the right hand doesn't have to know what the left hand is doing,\" said former Chiefs of Police Association Organize Crime Control Committee member Lester \"Les\" Paul. \"This case screams out for a special prosecutor, but don't expect that to happen with this administration,\" he added", "The FBI wants backdoors in all your crypto, and UK Prime Minister David Cameron made backdoors an election promise, but as Stanford lawyer/computer scientist Jonathan Mayer writes, there's no way to effectively backdoor modern platforms without abolishing the whole idea of computers as we know them, replacing them with an imaginary and totalitarian computing ecosystem that does not exist and probably never will.\n\nMayer gives the example of how stopping Android users from using crypto would require the abolition of third-party app stores, rolling back the state of the art in Web-based apps, introducing kill-switches to the platform that lets Google delete your apps and the data associated with them, and preventing jailbreaking at all costs.\n\nHe mentions that the same is true for Ios, though that's not exactly right -- it's a felony to jailbreak many Ios devices (Iphones, but not Ipads, are temporarily exempted from this thanks to a Copyright Office ruling that expires this year), and it's a felony to run a third-party Ios app store and supply jailbreaking tools for Ios. DRM-locked ecosystems are already designed to prevent users from running code that their users desire, and so it's conceptually a lot easier to understand how a government could simply say to all those companies -- Sony, Nintendo, Apple, Nest, John Deere, etc -- that the law required them to only approve apps with backdoors and then help the companies with their existing project of vigorously prosecuting jailbreak tool-makers, and get a much more airtight seal around users' ability to use good crypto.", "Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is marking its 30th anniversary by publishing a report that looks back on the three decades it has spent defending freedom of information.\n\nEntitled \"Saving independent journalism - 30 years defending media,\" the report examines what RSF has done on behalf of freedom of information for the past 30 years, what it is doing now, and the issues involved. It looks at RSF's biggest campaigns, its battles for the release of detained journalists, the demonstrations it has organized, its lobbying of international organizations, and its practical assistance for journalists who have been threatened, physically attacked or forced to flee abroad. And RSF pays tribute to its information heroes in an overview encompassing both details and big issues.\n\n\"The big little NGO\"\n\nFrom its creation in Montpellier in 1985 to its nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, Reporters Without Borders has grown to become an international NGO with a presence in all five continents and consultative status with the United Nations and UNESCO. Nowadays its activities span the entire globe thanks to a network of more than 150 correspondents and 12 international bureaux and sections.\n\nIn a forward to the report, secretary-general Christophe Deloire borrows from Victor Hugo's description of the street urchin Gavroche to define Reporters Without Borders as a \"big little NGO.\" Now aged 30, RSF has become a \"very big little NGO,\" Deloire adds. \"In the new propaganda era we are entering, the world needs Reporters Without Borders. Whether totalitarian, violent or soft, information control is taking unprecedented forms that free citizens must oppose with all their strength.\"\n\nNever-say-die activism\n\nResolute activism is one of RSF's defining characteristics. It boldly launched a pirate radio station in the centre of Beijing during the 2008 Olympics. It went to Kiev in 2002 and came back with samples of a murdered journalist's body to have independent forensic analyses done on them and thereby force an apathetic judge to take action. It took part in a commission of enquiry into the death of Norbert Zongo, a journalist killed in his car in Burkina Faso in 1998, and kept fighting until the official investigation was reopened 16 years later.\n\nRSF's ability to wage an effective campaign is another of its characteristics. Ever since the case of Brice Fleutiaux, a journalist who was taken hostage in Chechnya in 1999, Reporters Without Borders has mobilized massive public support for more than 20 hostage journalists. The projection on to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris of the photos of St\u00e9phane Taponier and Herv\u00e9 Ghesqui\u00e8re, two French journalists who were hostages in Afghanistan, will live on as a symbol of this tireless commitment to journalists kidnapped in the world's most dangerous regions. After being freed, Taponier and Ghesqui\u00e8re themselves said how important this campaign was during their captivity. When French reporters Didier Fran\u00e7ois, \u00c9douard \u00c9lias and Nicolas H\u00e9nin and photographer Pierre Torres were kidnapped in Syria in 2013, RSF again campaigned on their behalf until their release in 2014.\n\nHelping media and protecting journalists\n\nWhen five employees of the daily newspaper Oslobodenje were killed by an artillery bombardment of its headquarters during the siege of Sarajevo, RSF decided to come to the aid of this symbol of resistance to the violence enveloping the region. It provided the newspaper with newsprint, food and even an armour-plated truck to protect its journalists. In Haiti, just days after the 2010 earthquake, RSF set up a media operations centre in Port-au-Prince. Nowadays, RSF supports Paris-based Radio Erena, the world's only independent radio station broadcasting to Eritrea.\n\nRSF goes to the hotspots. In Ukraine in 2014, it sent protective helmets, goggles and masks for the journalists who were covering the clashes in Maidan Square. It has provided training in physical self-protection for around 100 journalists in Pakistan, where reporting is becoming more and more dangerous in the Tribal Areas. Emergency funding is sent to journalists to help them find a safe refuge, get medical attention or obtain legal aid.\n\n30, a good age\n\nRSF continues to provide unfailing support for those who often risk their lives to inform others. Whether Mazen Darwish in Syria, Raif Badawi in Saudi Arabia and Gao Yu in China, they are trapped by oppressive systems based on an intolerable level of censorship. RSF also campaigns tirelessly for freedom of information even when the attempts to silence independent voices occur in the most democratic countries, even when the targets are whistleblowers like Edward Snowden\n\nDespite many challenges, Reporters Without Borders will continue to defend freedom of information and media independence with determination, intensity and audacity.", "Lviv: He fought alongside the Nazis, then against them. He tried to drive the Soviets out of his native Ukraine, and spent 11 years in a prison camp in Russia.\n\nWhat does that make Oles Gumenyuk -- a fascist? Or a hero? It depends on who you ask.\n\nMustachioed and vigorous despite his 90 years, he calls himself a freedom fighter, proud of having served in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in World War II.\n\n\"We were warriors, fighters, patriots. We were proud people and never asked for compassion from our enemies,\" he said in an interview in his apartment in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.\n\nSeventy-five years on, it's a controversial boast.\n\nIn Ukraine's latest conflict, \"fascist\" is the insult hurled by pro-Russian separatists -- and Russian media -- at the Kiev government side.\n\nThe epithet harks back to the Ukrainian nationalist fighters who sided, for a time, with the Nazis, hoping they would drive out the Soviets during the war.\n\nAmong these was Gumenyuk, who at 18 joined a Ukrainian division of the Nazi SS force.\n\nHe says it was a strategic decision.\n\n\"We joined them so we could get trained. But we knew even then that Germany was going to lose the war,\" he said.\n\nAfter tactical training from the Germans, he joined the nationalist UPA, which first supported but then turned on the Nazis, fighting the Germans and the Red Army at the same time.On the wall of his apartment, Gumenyuk has a portrait of one of the most divisive figures in Ukraine's history: World War II nationalist leader Stepan Bandera.\n\nUkrainians in the west hail Bandera as a hero; others in the pro-Russian east and in Russia itself hate him, branding him a Nazi collaborator.\n\nSome historians say Ukrainian nationalists committed atrocities during World War II, notably against Poles in Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukraine's pro-European Union parliament this month gave them unprecedented recognition, adopting a new law granting UPA members the status of \"Ukrainian independence fighters\".\n\nParliament has also approved a controversial ban on Nazi and Communist symbols and propaganda.\n\nThe reforms have angered Russia at a time of tensions between the neighbours over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 6,000 people in the past year.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry accused Ukraine of \"rewriting history\". It said the law would \"create divisions\" and promote a \"nationalist ideology\".Formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Gumenyuk's native region of Ivano-Frankivsk was under Polish rule when he was born but would change hands several times over the course of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1939, \"when the Soviets arrived, we really thought that our brothers had come to liberate us from Poland,\" he recalled.\n\nAt that time, Ukrainians hung two flags in their villages: their yellow-and-blue national one and the red one for the Soviet troops.\n\n\"But after a couple of weeks, they started looking for those who had hung the yellow-and-blue flags and arresting them,\" Gumenyuk said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of western Ukrainians are said to have been killed or sent to Soviet prison camps in the ensuing repression.\n\n\"When the Germans arrived we also saw them as liberators,\" Gumenyuk said.\n\nIn September 1945, he was wounded in fighting against the Red Army and ended up a prisoner of the Soviets.\n\nHe spent the next 11 years in a Siberian prison camp in the far northern city of Norilsk, thousands of kilometres from his home in western Ukraine.\n\nParliament's recognition of UPA members as freedom fighters comes too late for most of his former brothers in arms, many of whom have died.\n\n\"But it is still very important for our descendants, so that our children's and grandchildren's generations can never say we were bandits,\" he said.\n\nLviv-based historian Igor Derevyaniy said the legislation could help Ukraine make peace with its painful history.\n\n\"It is a matter of justice for those who fought for a democratic Ukrainian state and those who died for it,\" he said.\n\n\"Ukraine for the first time is abandoning its totalitarian past.\"", "Taoiseach Enda Kenny has been urged to open a commission of investigation into the Siteserv sale scandal after it was claimed he and his Government \"covered up\" the issue for three years.\n\nThe Fine Gael leader faced yet more criticism over the controversial March 2012, as he insisted Finance Minister Michael Noonan did not attempt to pull the wool over the D\u00e1il's eyes in answers to parliamentary questions.\n\nDuring Leaders' Questions, Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said there is a clear need for an \"independent commission of investigation\" into a series of linked issues ranging from sudden share sales before the deal to Irish Water contracts.\n\nHe said the Government-backed investigation by IBRC's special liquidators Kieran Wallace and Eamonn Richardson has, \"at its heart\", a \"fundamental conflict of interest\" and is the \"wrong decision\".\n\nMr Martin said the fact the coalition has belatedly appointed a retired High Court judge to overview the inquiry to ensure no issues occur is the \"first time I've ever witnessed\" a Government \"admit a conflict of interest at the very start\".\n\nClaiming there has never been a proper examination of the deal, and that those in power \"cannot show who was buying shares in a company that was going bust\" under the current inquiry, he said Mr Kenny had tried to hide Department of Finance issues over the deal and that \"the D\u00e1il was misled and there was essentially a cover-up\".\n\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams alleged the current KPMG review is an \"extension of the cover-up\" and that his own party was \"stonewalled\" when seeking answers on Siteserv in 2012.\n\nHe accused the Coalition of \"sitting on this scandal\" to hide the \"toxic relationship\" between government and \"big business\".\n\n\"Isn't that why you won't set up a commission of investigation, because you don't want the taxpayers to know?\" he asked.\n\nSocialist Party TD Paul Murphy said the Coalition's actions were akin to the \"ignorance is strength\" slogan in George Orwell's classic novel about totalitarianism, Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\nHe said KPMG were involved in IBRC and Siteserv and are \"utterly compromised\" in terms of running an investigation, meaning the inquiry in its current format is \"incapable\" of finding the necessary answers including those surrounding \"the richest, luckiest man in Ireland\", Denis O'Brien.\n\nMr Murphy said \"all of the facts had to be dragged out from the [finance] minister\" -- asking if Michael Noonan should resign and accusing him of \"misleading\" the D\u00e1il -- a comment that led to a swift rebuke from Ceann Comhairle Sean Barrett.\n\nMr Kenny said he has \"absolute confidence\" in Mr Noonan and denied there was any cover-up.\n\nHe said Mr Murphy would be \"painting slogans\" outside the D\u00e1il akin to \"ignorance is strength\" if a commission of investigation -- which would take months to set up -- occurred, and told Mr Martin he would be \"first out of the traps\" making similar claims.\n\nResponding to Mr Adams, Mr Kenny said the Sinn F\u00e9in leader \"has a problem with the institutions of the State\".\n\nIndependent TD Catherine Murphy, who first raised questions over the Siteserv deal, added: \"Does that include KPMG?

It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd \"Wolf Hall's\" revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (\"the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people\"), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt's beautiful and hagiographic \"A Man for All Seasons.\"\n\nWho's right?\n\nNeither fully, though \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More-worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.\n\nIndeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More's persecution of Protestants. \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of Cromwell as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.\n\nNonetheless, Cromwell's modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance's brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps, too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.\n\nWhich Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry's Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today's reflexive anticlericalism. But we do well to remember that the centralized state Cromwell helped midwife did prepare the ground, over the coming centuries, for the rise of the rational, willful, thought-controlling, indeed all-controlling, state.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed. And while suppressing one kind of intolerance, they did little more than redefine heresy as an offense against the sovereignty not of God but of the state.\n\nHowever, \"Wolf Hall\" poses questions not just political but literary. When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous \"JFK\" will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" vs. the real T.E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. \"Wolf Hall\" is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce \"A Man For All Seasons.\" I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?", "North Korea's mass games, the annual spectacle, regularly features the flags of both North Korea and China. The two countries have been longtime historic allies since China came to the aid of North Koreans during the Korean War. However, some observers believe relations between the two nations have cooled recently. Story highlightsNext month's visit to Moscow by the North Korean leader is offThis Victory Day marks the 70 years since the Soviet victory over Germany in World War II\n\nMoscow (CNN)Never mind.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.\n\n\"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\" Peskov said. \"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\"\n\nThe visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011.\n\nHe was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nKim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations.\n\nKim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation.\n\nThere was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west.\n\nStill, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program.\n\nAnd news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year.\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing. And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear.\n\nThat said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world.\n\nAnd there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own.\n\nFollow @CNNbrk\n\nCNN's Madison Park and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow, and CNN's Ed Payne and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.", "New Republic: Don't Call Self-Avowed Socialist Bernie Sanders A Socialist\n\nThe latest gem from liberal magazine The New Republic is a thought-piece demanding that news outlets stop calling newly-declared Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders a socialist, despite the Vermont senator calling himself a socialist. (RELATED: New Republic Gets The Award For Dumbest Reaction To Fake Rolling Stone Story)\n\nIn \"Stop Calling Bernie Sanders a Socialist,\" freelance reporter Thor Benson rails against three outlets -- including The Daily Caller -- that identified Sanders as a socialist in their headlines announcing his run for president. To begin with, it seems odd to call out only three outlets when literally hundreds of news outlets have identified him as a socialist. Because he's a socialist.\n\nHe argues that \"in reality, Sanders calls himself a 'democratic socialist'\" ...which is a kind of socialist. Socialism is just an economic system; \"democratic socialists\" merely believe it should be enacted by democratic means (as opposed to through revolution or totalitarianism). Benson argument is akin to saying one shouldn't call Rand Paul a conservative because he identifies as a \"constitutional conservative.\"\n\nBut most irritatingly, Benson admits halfway through the piece that Sanders does identify as just a \"socialist\" at times. \"I am a socialist and everyone knows that,\" he said as far back as 1990 in his first House election. But that somehow didn't dissuade Benson from writing his op-ed anyway. (VIDEO: New Republic Editor Sets Record For Lamest Defense Of Hillary Clinton)\n\nSo in conclusion, news outlets are apparently at fault when they apply label Bernie Sanders a socialist, even though Bernie Sanders labels Bernie Sanders a socialist, and even though Bernie Sanders is clearly a socialist.", "Yesterday, on my way into Chipotle, I crossed paths with a guy wearing a bright pink T-shirt that screamed the following, in all caps: \"I STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.\" Unsurprisingly, he looked rather proud of himself. He also looked like he might punch you if you questioned his political beliefs, so I simply sighed and went on my merry way into Hillary Clinton's Fake Favorite Restaurant.\n\nBut seriously: What did the guy want, a trophy? A shirt declaring you're \"on the right side of history,\" regardless of the issue -- in this case, it appeared to be gay marriage -- might be the most self-centered, self-congratulatory garment in the entire world. The only competitor that comes to mind are those T-shirts with the arrows pointing to the wearer's biceps that say \"WELCOME TO THE GUN SHOW,\" and those at least have the merit of being funny.\n\nMuch has been said about the absurdity of stating that a person or idea is \"on the right side of history\" -- a belief that history is a linear, upward trajectory to an ever-improving society, punctured by occasional purifying conflicts. Looking back at the actual past, alas, tells a different story: History, if anything, seems cyclical, and it is alternately weird, crazy, confusing and cruel. Villains sometimes win. Dictators rise. People enslave other people. Wars erupt. There may be good and evil, and there may be ultimate cosmic justice at the hands of God, but human history has no \"right\" side for one reason: Bad things will inevitably happen again. (I have a close eye on Japanese robot \"nursemaids\" and the growing, lurking army of driverless cars.)\n\nThe overarching meaning of history is not a small topic, and it certainly makes for an interesting philosophical debate. But in the case of the smug pink T-shirt, ostensibly created to protect gay rights, the subtexts of history are merely an irrelevant sideshow. In the end, there was only one important word on that guy's T-shirt, and it wasn't \"history\" or even \"right.\" It was \"I.\"\n\nThe shirt, in other words, served as a simple form of social positioning and signaling. It granted superiority, separating the wearer from erroneous thinkers and rubes. Together with a growing host of \"correct\" cultural signifiers and accessories, it also effectively reveals the growing tribalism -- and authoritarianism -- of the progressive left.\n\nSociologists and anthropologists bemoan the demonization of \"the Other,\" a process often attributed to imperialism, racism, sexism or any instance where oppressive, powerful forces are bent on justifying the subjugation of certain groups. Lately, it seems that certain groups in America are mentally classifying a new, mysterious \"Other\" -- and if you're not a doctrinaire liberal with doctrinaire stances on certain social issues, you're likely a part of it.\n\nWe're now sadly familiar with the shunning that surrounds the issue of gay marriage: Just last week, a judge suggested a mind-boggling $135,000 fine for an Oregon family who refused to bake a cake for a lesbian wedding. But the net is cast far wider than that.\n\nLast week, speaking at a Women in the World Summit in Manhattan, Clinton declared that \"deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed\" when it comes to issues like abortion. Really? That's kind of a big deal, is it not? She sounds like she's on the Totalitarian Side of History! One can practically see the cartoon caricatures of primitive, benighted Christians skulking around in Clinton's mind, clinging to their religion and their silly respect for inconvenient human life: that pesky Other, always getting in the way of progress.\n\nThe \"right side of history\" crowd, it seems, views the future from a higher level than the rest of us -- and their vantage point comes from the lofty driver's seat of a giant, marauding, proverbial bulldozer. When you know what's right for everyone else in the world, after all, opposition must be quickly and efficiently crushed. The best way to get away with this is to disguise totalitarianism as \"freedom.\"\n\nRegardless of what you think about gay marriage -- and I think the government should get out of the \"marriage\" business altogether, leave churches alone and stick to civil unions for gay or straight couples -- that's exactly what's happening today. In approximately one month, there is a good chance that a single Supreme Court justice, Anthony Kennedy, will essentially decide the meaning of marriage for everyone in a country that purports to be free. If gay marriage is declared a constitutional right, the repercussions for churches, religious schools and the freedom of religion in general might surprise even the most ardent T-shirt wearer.\n\nThis seems kind of strange, doesn't it, not to mention capricious and tenuous? How did we get to this point? It certainly doesn't sound like the Right Side of History. Don't worry, though. In future iterations of this drama, we'll be repeatedly assured that it is.\n\nRealClearPolitics\n\nHeather Wilhelm is a writer based in Austin, Texas.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Chicago Tribune", "Perhaps the scariest thing about humans is their profound discomfort with ambiguity, and their concomitant desire to know things for sure, to have all the answers, and to demand that others believe exactly as they do.\n\nIdeology, it seems, is reasserting itself in a world that, less than a generation ago, appeared headed toward pluralism, tolerance and pragmatism, all bolstered by an unprecedented flow of free information that promised to render extremism obsolete.\n\nToo bad it hasn't worked out that way. Unpacking his 40-year career as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, John Burns recently concluded: \"What those years bred in me, more than anything else, was an abiding revulsion for ideology, in all its guises.\"\n\nBurns worked in some of the world's ugliest places, among them Soviet Russia, Mao's China, Afghanistan under the Taliban, South Africa under apartheid and North Korea under the Kim dynasty. \"I learned that there is no limit to the lunacy, malice and suffering that can plague any society with a ruling ideology,\" Burns reflected.\n\nBut even in the Britain and America to which he has now retired, Burns detects a frightening partisan rigidity. \"It can be depressing beyond words,\" he wrote, \"to hear the loyalists of a given political creed -- whether left or right -- adopt the unyielding certainties common in totalitarian states.\"\n\nWe agree. Screeds portraying government as a manifest evil are especially damaging because they taint even the most sensible government solutions. With national campaigns approaching, our fervent hope is that voters have grown weary of the threadbare recitations common to both parties and will instead demand pragmatic, creative and courageous approaches that bypass the tiresome interest groups. This campaign will be wasted if voters continue to hear (on the right) about the dreary social issues and the virtues of never, never raising taxes, and (on the left) about candidates \"who will fight for people like you.\" Oh, please!\n\nWe yearn for an agenda that matches the nation's and the state's actual problems: Creating a wider prosperity; building an infrastructure that works; forging a coherent, sophisticated foreign policy; fostering a truly effective system for education and training; reforming the corrupt financing of campaigns, and devising serious policies on climate and energy. We long for solutions based on hard evidence, not ideological correctness.\n\nIt's encouraging that ideology has suffered a few setbacks lately, among them the opening to Cuba and the repudiation of state laws that protected the \"religious freedom\" to discriminate. This advice from candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton offers another positive signal that should spread throughout the campaigns in both parties: \"Don't vote for anybody of any party anywhere in the country who proudly tells you they will never compromise.\"", "Ukraine Today visited Ukraine's history museum for an interview with a group of experts who plan to create a museum for exhibiting Soviet-era relics, with the government's support.\n\nThe Ukrainian minister of culture has described the project as a \"Museum of Totalitarianism.\" Some of the display pieces are to be donated from a current exposition at the history museum, Ukraine Today reports.\n\nThe staff at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine showed off some of the most typical Soviet-era relics which it is considering donating to the new museum.\n\nFlags, awards and trophies, World War Two medals and other artifacts are among the expected donations.\n\nAccording to researchers, life and the events that were unfolding during that period of history need to be shown and told about in order for the next generation to learn from the country's past.\n\nSome items were signature tools of Soviet propaganda that kept Ukraine firmly within Moscow's grasp.\n\nTetyana Sosnovska, general director of the history museum said the project may help future generations analyze and draw conclusions, and help them transition into modern Ukraine, understanding that \"any concentration of power can lead to something similar and delete one hundred years or more of a country's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, despite the project being criticized by some for its own supposedly propagandistic nature, the new museum is sure to become popular.\n\nSee unian.info's video section for more of the latest news from Ukraine in video from Ukraine Today, Ukraine's 24-hour English-language news channel.", "He fought alongside the Nazis, then against them.

The conclusion to what Marvel is dubbing its cinematic \"Phase Two\" (which includes the post-Avengers sequels to its original hits, as well as Guardians of the Galaxy), Ultron is a blockbuster designed to keep the superhero franchise moving forward. Yet if it's a movie that propels the studio's serialized narrative into its next phase, it's also a continuation of something else: Marvel's concurrent, politicized portrait of 21st century war and peace.\n\nA political angle is acutely felt throughout Ultron, which further dives into the very issues of democracy vs. autocracy, and security vs. warmongering, that have been at the core of not only both Avengers films, but also the Iron Man and Captain America series. In Joss Whedon's sequel, those topics come to the fore courtesy of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who in the aftermath of the first film's planet-imperiling alien invasion, becomes taken with the notion that he can harness one of the famed Infinity Stones (i.e. mythic objects of power) to create true Artificial Intelligence, which he can then use to create a virtual, defensive \"shield\" around the planet. It's a project that, like Stark's Iron Man armor and Iron Legion autobots, is driven by the idea that stability and safety can be achieved through the employment of militaristic technology and hardware -- so long as it's spearheaded by the right people.\n\nApparently unaware of where such good intentions often lead, Stark initiates his endeavor without first consulting his fellow Avengers (save for Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, who expresses grave reservations). The result is the birth of Ultron (James Spader), a robot who quickly deduces that the surest way to accomplish peace on Earth is to exterminate the Avengers -- and then the human race itself. For that reason, Ultron plays out like a worst-case scenario for Stark's belief in the benefits of using militaristic means to achieve global-tranquility ends. Except, of course, that the Avengers's potential savior comes courtesy of Iron Man himself, as well as the Vision (Paul Bettany), a robo-child of Ultron blessed with the sentience of Stark's computer program, JARVIS.\n\nIt's not surprising that Ultron is of two minds about the positive applications of techno-artillery, since a similar schism runs throughout the Iron Man trilogy.\n\nStark's Iron Man origin story is one in which he recognizes the folly of his corporate arms-manufacturing ways -- given that his weapons are in the hands of the very enemies who take him captive in Afghanistan -- and then develops his own one-man armament suit to carry out justice on a domestic and international scale. He's a critic of the military-industrial complex (of which he's a chief component) and its increasing sway over American diplomacy, which gives him a distinctly left-leaning political orientation that's further mirrored by Iron Man 3's portrait of Middle East terrorists (i.e. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin) as mere phony, media-filtered puppets of the world's real villains: American capitalists! And yet, all three Iron Man films also celebrate a tough-talking, off-the-cuff, go-it-alone rebel outfitted with more weaponry than your average tank, which skews the series in a distinctly opposite, right-inclined direction.\n\nThe same also holds true for Mr. Red, White, and Blue himself, Captain America, especially with regards to his sophomore solo outing, 2014's The Winter Soldier. Directed by the Russo Brothers, that sequel channels the spirit of paranoia-drenched 1970s thrillers -- most overtly, 1975's Three Days of the Condor -- for a story in which Cap (Chris Evans) learns that the covert government agency he's been working for, S.H.I.E.L.D., is secretly developing a trio of gigantic helicarriers that will work with spy satellites to preemptively take out targets. In other words, what he discovers is a clandestine super-drone project, which is depicted as evil in and of itself, even before it's revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D. (the supposed government good guys) are actually controlled by Hydra (the proto-Nazi bad guys).\n\n\"[Anthony] and I just looked at the issues that were causing anxiety for us, because we read a lot and are politically inclined. And a lot of that stuff had to do with civil liberties issues, drone strikes, the president's kill list, preemptive technology,\" said Winter Soldier co-director Joe Russo.\n\n\"The question is, where do you stop?\" he continued. \"If there are 100 people we can kill to make us safer, do we do it? What if we find out there's 1,000? What if we find out there's 10,000? What if it's a million? At what point do you stop?\"\n\nConsequently, Cap is forced to confront an American military in thrall to anti-democratic, preemptive strike-loving villains -- which he successfully combats thanks to the superhuman powers he received (via Nazi-esque \"Super Soldier\" scientific experimentation) from that very same military.\n\nTrading in topics that relate to real-world debates about the nuclear bomb, to American intervention in the Middle East, and to the ongoing global War on Terror, the Marvel movies, and Ultron in particular, come across as having been designed to play well on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nStark's cocky lone-wolf attitude toward creating Ultron, which involves disregarding his comrades' opinions and using dangerous technology as he sees fit, is the kind of cowboy-badass heroism that seems targeted at red state audiences. Meanwhile, the fact that Ultron ultimately argues that crises are best resolved by altruistic people (albeit superpeople) working together rather than via shock-and-awe armaments, is more apt to please blue state viewers. As in the rest of the studio's output -- including Guardians of the Galaxy, which champions teamwork and togetherness at the same time that it celebrates DIY roguish heroism -- Marvel's latest strikes a careful balance between delivering anti-authoritarian, anti-military political messages, and lionizing independent badasses who use their own militaristic (or paranormal) might to get the job done in the best way they see fit.\n\nWhich isn't to argue that Ultron and its predecessors are fundamentally hypocritical. Instead, like The Dark Knight's two-sided opinion that Batman's vigilantism is both the cure for -- and the factor that causes an escalation in -- crime, Marvel's movies straddle politicized lines because, no matter their brightly colored comic book origins, they strive to create worlds steeped in moral greys. They're conflicted at heart because the issues they aim to tackle, from the limits of democracy and the dangers of totalitarianism to the practical pluses and minuses of remote-controlled warfare, often offer no easy answers. And if courting both liberals and conservatives also helps their films appeal to the widest possible moviegoing audience, well, you can't fault a studio for being populist as well.\n\n\"This is a very global film,\" Whedon said of Ultron. \"We wanted the world perspective on The Avengers. They're being The Avengers and that's a global thing and it doesn't make everybody love them, so we wanted to see both sides of that.\"", "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in front of a poster of his father, Hafez al-Assad.\n\n(image by Consortium News)\n\nIf Syrian President Bashar al-Assad meets the same fate as Libya's Muammar Gaddafi or Iraq's Saddam Hussein, much of Official Washington would rush out to some chic watering hole to celebrate -- one more \"bad guy\" down, one more \"regime change\" notch on the belt. But the day after Damascus falls could mark the beginning of the end for the American Republic.\n\nAs Syria would descend into even bloodier chaos -- with an Al-Qaeda affiliate or its more violent spin-off, the Islamic State, the only real powers left -- the first instinct of American politicians and pundits would be to cast blame, most likely at President Barack Obama for not having intervened more aggressively earlier.\n\nThough no such \"moderate\" rebel movement ever existed -- at least not in any significant numbers -- that reality is ignored by all the \"smart people\" of Washington. It is simply too good a talking point to surrender. The truth is that Obama was right when he told New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman in August 2014 that the notion of a \"moderate\" rebel force that could achieve much was \"always ... a fantasy.\"\n\nAs much fun as the \"who lost Syria\" finger-pointing would be, it would soon give way to the horror of what would likely unfold in Syria with either Al-Qaeda's Nusra Front or the spin-off Islamic State in charge -- or possibly a coalition of the two with Al-Qaeda using its new base to plot terror attacks on the West while the Islamic State engaged in its favorite pastime, those YouTube decapitations of infidels -- Alawites, Shiites, Christians, even some descendants of the survivors from Turkey's Armenian genocide a century ago who fled to Syria for safety.\n\nSuch a spectacle would be hard for the world to watch and there would be demands on President Obama or his successor to \"do something.\" But realistic options would be few, with a shattered and scattered Syrian army no longer a viable force capable of driving the terrorists from power.\n\nThe remaining option would be to send in the American military, perhaps with some European allies, to try to dislodge Al-Qaeda and/or the Islamic State. But the prospects for success would be slim. The goal of conquering Syria -- and possibly re-conquering much of Iraq as well -- would be costly, bloody and almost certainly futile.\n\nThe further diversion of resources and manpower from America's domestic needs also would fuel the growing social discontent in major U.S. cities, like what is now playing out in Baltimore where disaffected African-American communities are rising up in anger against poverty and the police brutality that goes with it. A new war in the Middle East would accelerate America's descent into bankruptcy and a dystopian police state.\n\nThe last embers of the American Republic would fade. In its place would be endless war and a single-minded devotion to security. The National Security Agency already has in place the surveillance capabilities to ensure that any civil resistance could be thwarted.\n\nCan This Fate Be Avoided?\n\nBut is there a way to avoid this grim fate? Is there a way to wind this scenario back to some point before this outcome becomes inevitable? Can the U.S. political/media system -- as corrupt and cavalier as it is -- find a way to avert such a devastating foreign policy disaster?\n\nTo do so would require Official Washington to throw off old dependencies, such as its obeisance to the Israel Lobby, and old habits, such as its reliance on manipulative PR to control the American people, patterns deeply engrained in the political process.\n\nAt least since the Reagan administration -- with its \"kick the Vietnam Syndrome\" fascination via \"public diplomacy\" and \"perception management\" -- the tendency has been to designate some foreign leader as the latest new villain and then whip up public hysteria in support of a \"regime change.\" [See Consortiumnews.com's \"The Victory of Perception Management.\"]\n\nIn the 1980s, we saw the use of these \"black hat/white hat\" exaggerations in Nicaragua, where President Ronald Reagan deemed President Daniel Ortega \"the dictator in designer glasses\" as Reagan's propagandists depicted Sandinista-ruled Nicaragua as a \"totalitarian dungeon\" and the CIA-trained Contra \"freedom fighters\" the \"moral equal of the Founding Fathers.\"\n\nAnd, since Ortega and the Sandinistas were surely not the embodiment of all virtue, it was hard to put Reagan's black-and-white depiction into the proper shades of gray. To make the effort opened you to charges of being a \"Sandinista apologist.\" Similarly, any negative news about the Contras -- such as their tendencies to rape, murder, torture and smuggle drugs -- was sternly suppressed with offending U.S. journalists targeted for career retaliation.\n\nThe pattern set by Reagan around Nicaragua and other Central American conflicts became the blueprint for how to carry out these post-Vietnam War propaganda operations. Afterwards came Panama's \"madman\" Manuel Noriega in 1989 and Iraq's \"worse than Hitler\" Saddam Hussein in 1990-91. Each American war was given its own villainous lead actor.", "The bombing makes it easy to realise the brutal thoroughness of totalitarian warfare\n\nThe peculiar horror and ruthlessness of the recent raid on Guernica must not cause us to forget the regular and senseless bombardment of Madrid which has been going on continually for the past three weeks. One may take it that this is all part of a policy of intimidation deliberately adopted by the rebels to break the nerve of the loyal civilian population. But neither in the Basque provinces nor at Madrid is it likely to succeed.\n\nOur special correspondent now in Madrid sends us a graphic account of the bombardment which makes it easy to realise the brutal thoroughness of totalitarian warfare. One can welcome any international action which might be taken to mitigate the horrors of this merciless war. The difficulty is to obtain agreement from both sides to accept and to respect international arrangements. General Franco has said: \"Madrid will have to be destroyed district by district, no matter how much I regret it.\" At one time in November he chose and respected a Madrid safety zone, but the Government said it was impossible to move the whole civilian population into a few streets; when the International Red Cross suggested a neutral zone in Madrid the Government reply was that \"it was tantamount to admitting that the bombardment of the remainder of the civil population was a legal act.\" For his part, General Franco could argue that a safety zone would be used as a centre for military stores and weapons. But the presence of neutral observers would be an answer to this last objection.\n\nMeanwhile there should be no objection to the British navy assisting the evacuation of the non-combatants from Bilbao, and it would no doubt in any case afford protection outside the three-mile limit to British ships engaged in the work of evacuation. The Home Secretary has agreed to admit Basque refugee children to this country if funds are available for their maintenance. A country which has been generous to political refugees in the past will not hesitate to come to the help of these unfortunate children.", "Yesterday, on my way into Chipotle, I crossed paths with a guy wearing a bright pink t-shirt that screamed the following, in all caps: \"I STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.\" Unsurprisingly, he looked rather proud of himself. He also looked like he might punch you if you questioned his political beliefs, so I simply sighed and went on my merry way into Hillary Clinton's Fake Favorite Restaurant.\n\nBut seriously: What did the guy want? A trophy? A shirt declaring you're \"on the right side of history,\" regardless of the issue -- in this case, it was gay marriage -- might be the most self-centered, self-congratulatory garment in the entire world. The only competitor that comes to mind are those t-shirts with the arrows pointing to the wearer's biceps that say \"WELCOME TO THE GUN SHOW,\" and those at least have the merit of being funny.\n\nMuch has been said about the absurdity of stating that a person or idea is \"on the right side of history\" -- a belief that history is a linear, upward trajectory to an ever-improving society, punctured by occasional purifying conflicts. Looking back at the actual past, alas, tells a different story: History, if anything, seems cyclical, and it is alternately weird, crazy, confusing, and cruel. Villains sometimes win. Dictators rise. People enslave other people. Wars erupt. There may be good and evil, and there may be ultimate cosmic justice at the hands of God, but human history has no \"right\" side for one reason: Bad things will inevitably happen again. (I, for one, have a close eye on Japanese robot \"nursemaids\" and the growing, lurking army of driverless cars.)\n\nThe overarching meaning of history is not a small topic, and it certainly makes for an interesting philosophical debate. But in the case of the smug pink t-shirt, ostensibly created to protect gay rights, the subtexts of history are merely an irrelevant sideshow. In the end, there was only one important word on that guy's t-shirt, and it wasn't \"history\" or even \"right.\" It was \"I.\"\n\nThe shirt, in other words, served as a simple form of social positioning and signaling. It granted superiority, separating the wearer from erroneous thinkers and rubes. Together with a growing host of \"correct\" cultural signifiers and accessories, it also effectively reveals the growing tribalism -- and authoritarianism -- of the progressive left.\n\nSociologists and anthropologists bemoan the demonization of \"the Other,\" a process often attributed to imperialism, racism, sexism, or any instance where oppressive, powerful forces are bent on justifying the subjugation of certain groups. Lately, it seems that certain groups in America are mentally classifying a new, mysterious \"Other\" -- and if you're not a doctrinaire liberal with doctrinaire stances on certain social issues, you're likely a part of it.\n\nWe're now sadly familiar with the shunning that surrounds the issue of gay marriage: Just last week, a judge suggested a mind-boggling $135,000 fine for an Oregon family who refused to bake a cake for a lesbian wedding. But the net is cast far wider than that.\n\nLast week, speaking at a Women in the World Summit in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton declared that \"deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed\" when it comes to issues such as abortion. Really? That's kind of a big deal, is it not? She sounds like she's on the Totalitarian Side of History! One can practically see the cartoon caricatures of primitive, benighted Christians skulking around in Ms. Clinton's mind, clinging to their religion and their silly respect for inconvenient human life: that pesky Other, always getting in the way of progress.\n\nThe \"right side of history\" crowd, it seems, views the future from a higher level than the rest of us -- and their vantage point comes from the lofty driver's seat of a giant, marauding, proverbial bulldozer. When you know what's right for everyone else in the world, after all, opposition must be quickly and efficiently crushed. The best way to get away with this is to disguise totalitarianism as \"freedom.\"\n\nRegardless of what you think about gay marriage -- and I think the government should get out of the \"marriage\" business altogether, leave churches alone, and stick to civil unions for gay or straight couples -- that's exactly what's happening today. In approximately one month, there is a good chance that a single Supreme Court justice, Anthony Kennedy, will essentially decide the meaning of marriage for everyone in a country that purports to be free. If gay marriage is declared a constitutional right, the repercussions for churches, religious schools, and the freedom of religion in general might surprise even the most ardent t-shirt wearer.\n\nThis seems kind of strange, doesn't it, not to mention capricious and tenuous? How did we get to this point? It certainly doesn't sound like the Right Side of History. Don't worry, though. In future iterations of this drama, we'll be repeatedly assured that it is."], "2015-05-01": ["On April 30, Jonathan Cohn provided a perfect example of what America's media get wrong about the meaning of \"socialism\" -- and about the meaning of the new U.S. Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders.\n\nCohn's report was aptly titled, \"Bernie Sanders Is a Socialist and That's Not as Crazy as It Sounds,\" and indeed, he started right away with an assumption that socialism is crazy but \"not as crazy as it sounds.\"\n\nCohn said that \"Socialism, as commonly understood by Americans, means widespread government ownership of business,\" but Cohn said that, \"that's not the agenda Sanders has actually been promoting.\"\n\nCohn reassured the reader there that Sanders instead \"generally identifies himself as a democratic socialist. The distinction matters. Democratic socialism, as generally conceived in the U.S., is a milder, more aspirational form of the ideology.\"\n\nFirst of all, Cohn fundamentally misrepresented Sanders in this. Sanders has always identified himself as a democratic socialist. There is a huge difference between \"generally\" versus \"always,\" in this particular context. To say that Sanders \"generally\" identifies himself as a democratic socialist is to say that sometimes he self-identifies as being instead a proponent of dictatorial socialism. That's outright false.\n\nBut the mush in Cohn's head then gets even mushier. He continues by alleging that \"Democratic socialism ... is a milder, more aspirational form of the ideology\" than is \"widespread government ownership of business.\"\n\nActually, it's an entirely different ideology. It's not a different \"form of the ideology\"; it's a different and fundamentally opposite (because democratic) ideology. \"Widespread government ownership of business\" is communism, not socialism. Sanders never has supported or endorsed that. He has instead said -- and repeatedly and clearly, much more so than mush-headed 'journalists' such as Cohn -- that (to use his words):\n\nBranding someone as a socialist has become the slur du jour by leading lights of the American right from Newt Gingrich to Rush Limbaugh. Some, like Mike Huckabee, intentionally blur the differences between socialism and communism, between democracy and totalitarianism.\n\nIn fact, that very same statement from Senator Sanders continued:\n\nIf we could get beyond such nonsense, I think this country could use a good debate about what goes on here compared to places with a long social-democratic tradition like Sweden, Norway and Finland, where, by and large, the middle class has a far higher standard of living than we do.\n\nHe was telling the truth there, not distorting what a U.S. Presidential candidate (namely, he) believes.\n\nNo matter how many times the junior U.S. Senator from Vermont (junior to the veteran Democrat Patrick Leahy, who is almost a soul-mate of Sanders but more moderate in his expressions of his beliefs, and also slightly less progressive than he) asserts that the nordic European countries represent reasonably close models to Sanders's ideal, and that the former USSR never was anything of the kind, 'journalists,' and Republicans, mush together those mainly-opposite models.\n\nFor Republicans to do this is understandable, since they're supporters of the corporate State, otherwise called \"fascism,\" and that's (those corporations are) who donates the major money into the Republican Party and who have called its fascist tune almost without interruption since 1896; and democratic socialism is the very opposite of that.\n\nHowever, there's no excuse when 'journalists' do this. False 'reporting' is simply unprofessional. But it's normal in American 'journalism,' a field that's taught at the university level in schools that are in \"Communications\" departments where they share personnel with public relations and other forms of outright and prostituted deceptions-for-hire. That's the standard model of 'journalism' in fascist countries, because they're controlled by their top international corporations. That's the virtually universal standard of 'journalism' in the United States these days. Truthfulness is almost irrelevant in such 'journalism.' Authentic journalism is rare in such nations. (It's sadly rare in all nations.)\n\nSecondly, there is nothing at all 'aspirational' to Sanders's ideology: it was the ideology of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and I present the case in my latest book that FDR played a bigger role in establishing this ideology than did any other single person, starting in 1932 when he introduced in a campaign speech (and then in his subsequent Presidency) the intellectual underpinning for the most advanced form of this economic model, the most advanced form of a democratic-socialist economy and body-politic. If that was 'aspirational' for the greatest U.S. President of the 20th Century (as historians generally recognize FDR to have been), then what FDR was 'aspiring' to was still far more like today's nordic European democracies than it is like today's (the post-1980) U.S.A.; and Bernie Sanders represents that FDR-ideal far more than does any other current U.S. Presidential candidate.\n\nAnd Sanders represents not at all Marxism or communism (what Cohn called \"widespread government ownership of business\"), and is just as alien to that tradition as he is to fascism, because both of those traditions are simply the left-and-right wings of dictatorship, and democracy is at the very opposite end from any of that.\n\nThis essay from Sanders goes on, in fact, to describe his impression of one of the nordic democracies, Finland, from his recent visit there:\n\n\"Finland is a country which provides high-quality health care to all of its people with virtually no out-of-pocket expense; where parents and their young children receive free excellent childcare and/or parental leave benefits which dwarf what our nation provides; where college and graduate education is free to students and where children in the public school system often record the highest results in international tests. In Finland, where 80 percent of workers belong to unions, all employees enjoy at least 30 days paid vacation and the gap between the rich and poor is far more equitable than in the United States.\"\n\nBut Sanders also is realistic about the difference between any particular example, such as Finland, versus any ideal, such as democratic socialism:\n\n\"Let's be clear. Finland is no utopia. Not so many years ago, it experienced a severe economic downturn. Its economy today is not immune to what is happening in the rest of the world. There also are, to be sure, important differences between the United States and Finland -- a small country with a population of only 5.2 million people. Finland has a very homogenous population. We are extremely diverse. Finland is the size of Montana. We stretch 3,000 miles from coast to coast.\"\n\nIf you want to know what Sanders believes, read his statements, not articles about him in corporate media. Whereas the campaign statements of politicians such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have often been contradicted by their actual actions once they have gained power, Sanders's statements and his entire record as a public official have been one-and-the-same.\n\nBut, above all, get to know his actual voting-record as a U.S. Senator and a Congressman before that. It's a record that Franklin Delano Roosevelt would probably be proud to call his own if he were still alive and in politics today.\n\nSenator Sanders just wants to bring the Democratic Party -- and the American Government -- back to the ideals that motivated it when the greatest Democratic President was in charge.\n\nSanders's message is based on something timeless. It goes all the way back to the Gracchi brothers in ancient Rome. You see lots of that in FDR's speeches, too, and in FDR's subsequent actions as the U.S. President. It's the ideology, progressivism, but Sanders sometimes uses the term \"socialism\" to refer to it, because that's the term that is used in the most-successful countries, where it has actually long been instituted.\n\nAnd, if you want to understand where that ideology comes from in the very particular case of Sanders himself, just read his background. (That's from wikipedia, but it fails to link to any documentation where it says that he \"opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq,\" so here's the source on that highly important matter. He's not like Hillary Clinton; he doesn't have to apologize on that enormous 'blunder' by this country; he doesn't have to say, \"A person who got that judgment wrong will be the best person to occupy the Oval Office.\" He can hold his head high while he speaks the truth about important matters.)\n\nThere: you now already know more about Sanders -- and more about his \"socialism\" -- than you are likely to get to know truthfully from America's corporate media (or from our corporate-backed NPR or PBS either).\n\nMaking these sorts of things clear is not what America's press is designed to do. And that fact is going to become a very big problem for candidate Sanders to try to overcome -- he won't be trying to overcome only Hillary Clinton and the Republican Party, but also the press. Or, as the propagandists put it: \"our free press.\" (It's not 'ours,' and it's not 'free.')\n\nThey can mock his idealism and say that our country is too corrupt for anything of the sort to \"work\" here. But that was already the general direction America was heading in between 1932 and 1968, when the racist and corporate opposition finally brought it down and Richard Nixon's \"Southern Strategy\" restored the planter-class in its newer corporate form. Sanders is merely trying to turn that around. He wants to make a real political difference.\n\nHe wants to present a clear alternative -- and to do it within the Democratic Party, which was formerly led by the very same ideological tradition that he represents. He wants to bring the Democratic Party back to its own modern FDR roots.\n\nFar from its being 'aspirational,' Sanders's \"socialism\" was the actual direction this nation was going in during 1932-1968, and is the direction in which much of Europe has already surpassed America after the U.S. itself turned away from this \"socialism.\"\n\nThe corporate media will mock him, and the big money will be against him, but he is only doing what, under the prevailing historical circumstances, he believes that America, at this stage in our national history, needs to be done. He really believes that, if he doesn't do it, then no one will. And he really believes that the only way it can be done is if he wins the U.S. Presidency. Unlike Ralph Nader, he really is in this to win, not merely to throw the election to the Republican nominee in order to punish the Democratic Party for its lack of purism.\n\nOne of the few real journalists (as opposed to mere stenographers to the powerful) whose career is successful in today's America, Matt Taibbi, headlined in Rolling Stone (since he's too good a journalist to be hired by such media as the New York Times or the Washington Post or FRONTLINE or \"60 Minutes,\" or etc.) on April 29, \"Give 'Em Hell, Bernie: Bernie Sanders is more serious than you think.\" He wrote of Sanders, \"That's the one who cares.\" Taibbi should know; he is among the few good journalists who have met enough of the aspirants to be able to recognize the difference between authenticity and fakery. And he had spent lots of time with Sanders back in 2005, to do an in-depth article subtitled, \"A month inside the house of horrors that is Congress.\" Sanders is not part of the Establishment, and doesn't want to be.\n\nSanders is a progressive populist who says what he means, and who means what he says; and that's the main reason why the Establishment is so afraid of him. They don't want to lose control of the Government. But he is committed to their losing control of the Government. Calling his ideology by any name, either \"socialism,\" or \"progressivism,\" or \"populism,\" or simply \"democracy,\" they fear it. And they fear him.\n\nThis is why, if his candidacy somehow takes off, the bosses will be taking off their gloves, and putting on their brass knuckles. It will be political war in America, no mere political campaign. Thus, his candidacy, if it gets any traction at all, will supercharge Hillary Clinton's already-enormous campaign chest. All prior campaign-spending records will become exceeded long before Election Day has arrived. And things will have gotten very ugly.\n\nThis will not be a sectional war, like 1860. It will be a class war. In 1860, the issue was whether to free the slaves from their masters. In 2016 it will be whether to free the public from the aristocracy. Think Europe 1848, though it won't necessarily be the failure on this side of the Atlantic that that was on theirs nearly two centuries ago.\n\nBut if Sanders's campaign fails to take off, there won't be any such war at all, just continued ongoing victory for the aristocracy, against everyone else. For example, in the latter link, the \"Table 1. Real Income Growth by Groups\" shows that during 2009-2012, the bottom 99% received 0.8% of America's \"Real Income Growth,\" while in 2012-1013, the bottom 99% received 0.2% of that \"Real Income Growth.\" Though essentially all of the economic benefits from the post-'recession' 'recovery' went to the top 1% economic group, there was, starting in 2009, no more 'recession' in the U.S. as economists measure those things; all of this is instead referred to by them as 'economic recovery,' even though far fewer than 1% experienced any of whatever it was.\n\nBeyond any abstractions about ideology, Senator Sanders is now entering the Democratic Party to take it over by declaring that this is an economic performance that Democrats should condemn, as a Party. And he is hoping that many Independents and even a few Republicans will join with him in this fundamental battle for the collective heart, mind, and body, of this nation, this culture, this country, this society.\n\nSanders is not a William Jennings Bryan type. He is no religious fundamentalist. His war is strictly about this world, not about any other. To him, morality concerns only how people treat others, not about how they treat any god.\n\nIf he wins his war, then he will change the world, but it will be only this world, not any other, that he changes. His enemies might try to turn God against him, but he will not worry, if he has the people with him. And, in aristocrats' hearts of hearts, that's all they really worry about, too. Everything else is mere propaganda. The media know all about it. In a sense, it's their specialty.", "Mark Tooley is the president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD).\n\nHere's a marvelous story of the CIA operative who helped some of the 65,000 South Vietnamese who escaped in the final few days before Saigon fell to the Communists on April 30, 1975, just in time for May Day, the international Marxist holiday.\n\nIt's a rare uplifting vignette from a shameful, horrific episode, when three nations, South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, were surrendered to totalitarianism and genocide, with America turning its back on former allies.\n\nThere are some aging religious activists, like Jim Wallis, who still celebrate their role in forcing American defeat in Southeast Asia, with all the consequent horrors for the millions consigned to live under Communism. They have no shame and no recollection of actual history beyond romanticized youthful protest marches. Nearly 2 million were murdered after Cambodia's \"liberation\" by the Khmer Rouge. The new Marxist regimes installed in Laos and what had been South Vietnam directly murdered thousands, put hundreds of thousands in reeducation camps, and kept millions chained under dictatorships demanding authority over every aspect of life.\n\nThe new biography of public theologian Richard Neuhaus, IRD co-founder, recounts that his drift away from The Left began partly when his former anti-war comrades failed to join him in condemning the atrocities in conquered Communist controlled Indochina. IRD was founded in part because Church World Service, the relief arm of the National Council of Churches, was funding Communist \"New Economic Zones\" in conquered South Vietnam, a form of collectivization that unsurprisingly displaced millions and killed thousands.\n\nAs a boy of age 10 I followed the fall of Saigon and Vientane, preceded by Phnom Penh, closely. I still recall the giant Washington Post headlines and the television footage of panicked thousands trying to flee. A classmate's relative who had worked at the U.S. embassy in Laos shared her slides with our class, showing the impending Communist takeover and their own dramatic escape. I never forgot.\n\nThe following year my native Arlington, Virginia began filling with resettled Vietnamese refugees, many of whom would become classmates and friends. The Catholic Church in our neighborhood adopted a Vietnamese family, who lived on the church grounds, the parents working for the church, the children attending the school. They became family friends. I recall the one boy telling me they supported President Ford's reelection because of his accepting so many South Vietnamese to America.\n\nThese Vietnamese refugees who initially had nothing sent their almost universally academically successful children to college, and today nearly all the Vietnamese I know are thriving. By the 1980s many if not most of the Vietnamese in Arlington left their small apartments and purchased larger homes in the suburbs.\n\nIn 1975 America accepted about 125,000 South Vietnamese, most of whom had served the U.S. during the war. Another quarter million came in the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of them \"boat people\" who risked capture, drowning, starvation and pirates to escape the Communist paradise. Another half million came in the following decade. Most of the Vietnamese I knew had escaped in 1975, but I had one friend who was a failed boat person, having been caught, but later escaping legally by plane, his family already in the U.S. having secured permission. Today there are about 1.7 million Vietnamese Americans.\n\nReligious Left demands for open borders or claims that entry to the U.S. is a global right are of course absurd. Every nation must and should control immigration based on national interest. America was right to accept fleeing Vietnamese who had served America faithfully and were imperiled under their new masters because of it.\n\nOver 50,000 Americans gave their lives trying to preserve South Vietnam. President Nixon early in his first term promised South Vietnam the support of U.S. ground troops through 1972, when the peace accord was later reached, and air support through 1976, which would have enforced that accord. Of course, Watergate destroyed Nixon, and the strongly anti-war Congress rejected further U.S. military involvement, despite North Vietnam's unabashed violation of the peace.\n\nFormer National Council of Churches chief Bob Edgar, an ordained United Methodist elected to Congress in 1974, often boasted he had voted against aid for South Vietnam. He's now presumably in Heaven and hopefully apologizing to some of the millions of Southeast Asians who died due to his act.\n\nAt least the U.S. effort in Vietnam helped prevent other nations in the region from falling to Communism, allowing them time instead to become prosperous and at least semi-democratic. But it's still sad to contemplate that South Vietnam would now resemble South Korea had it survived. Communist Vietnam has liberalized economically but not so much politically.\n\nIn the earlier cited article, a Vietnamese American hails his CIA rescuer of April 1975 as a sort of Oskar Schindler, responsible for many Vietnamese of now several generations alive and free in America. God honor his memory, along with many others who served, both American and Vietnamese, and may we never forget April 1975 as a constant lesson for the future.", "\"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS). It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd \"Wolf Hall's\" revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (\"the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people\"), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt's beautiful and hagiographic \"A Man for All Seasons.\"\n\nWho's right? Neither fully, though \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More-worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.\n\nIndeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More's persecution of Protestants. \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of Cromwell as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.\n\nNonetheless, Cromwell's modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance's brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.\n\nWhich Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry's Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today's reflexive anticlericalism. But we do well to remember that the centralized state Cromwell helped midwife did prepare the ground, over the coming centuries, for the rise of the rational, willful, thought-controlling, indeed all-controlling, state.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed. And while suppressing one kind of intolerance, they did little more than redefine heresy as an offense against the sovereignty not of God but of the state.\n\nHowever, \"Wolf Hall\" poses questions not just political but literary. When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous \"JFK\" will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" vs. the real T.E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. \"Wolf Hall\" is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce \"A Man For All Seasons.\" I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?", "Alexander J.

Unpacking his 40-year career as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, John Burns recently concluded: \"What those years bred in me, more than anything else, was an abiding revulsion for ideology, in all its guises.\"\n\nBurns worked in some of the world's ugliest places, among them Soviet Russia, Mao's China, Afghanistan under the Taliban, South Africa under apartheid and North Korea under the Kim dynasty.\n\n\"I learned that there is no limit to the lunacy, malice and suffering that can plague any society with a ruling ideology,\" Burns reflected.\n\nBut even in the Britain and America to which he has now retired, Burns detects a frightening partisan rigidity. \"It can be depressing beyond words,\" he wrote, \"to hear the loyalists of a given political creed -- whether left or right -- adopt the unyielding certainties common in totalitarian states.\"\n\nWe agree. Screeds portraying government as a manifest evil are especially damaging because they taint even the most sensible government solutions. With national campaigns approaching, our fervent hope is that voters have grown weary of the threadbare recitations common to both parties and will instead demand pragmatic, creative and courageous approaches that bypass the tiresome interest groups.

We long for solutions based on hard evidence, not ideological correctness. It's encouraging that ideology has suffered a few setbacks lately, among them the opening to Cuba and the repudiation of state laws that protected the \"religious freedom\" to discriminate.\n\nThis advice from candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton offers another positive signal that should spread throughout the campaigns in both parties: \"Don't vote for anybody of any party anywhere in the country who proudly tells you they will never compromise.\"", "According to the country's leading trade unions, which organized the protests, the Madrid demonstration was attended by tens of thousands.

If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?\n\nCharles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column for The Washington Post. He is also a Fox News commentator.", "Star Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine's 1995 version of Richard III is an outstanding Shakespeare adaptation that sticks to the words on the page while seamlessly updating the setting of the play from the 15th Century War of the Roses to the 1930s and the rise of fascism in England. This choice is pointed, but not heavy-handed or boringly literal in its analogy. In fact, this is one of the most primarily entertaining Shakespeare films to date, with Loncraine focusing heavily on how to tell his story visually while he and McKellen (sharing screenplay credit) shave one of Shakespeare's longest plays down to a brisk but totally satisfying 100 minutes.\n\nRichard III, of course, is one of English literature's greatest anti-heroes, a crippled hunchback whose physical deformities were no match for his misshapen psyche. Scholars will argue about the historical accuracy of this portrayal of Richard -- maybe he wasn't a hunchback, maybe he wasn't a bloodthirsty tyrant -- but there's little argument that Shakespeare created an endlessly fascinating character -- and a juicy part to play. McKellen's Richard is a wickedly self-aware, unrepentantly murderous schemer, whose hunger to be king is ravenous and whose morbid sense of humor consistently comes to the fore. As in Oliver Parker's contemporaneous Othello, where Kenneth Branagh's Iago treated the audience like a confidante, McKellen delivers certain soliloquies and asides directly to camera. Rather than fully spill his guts to us, however, McKellen's Richard is essentially a monstrous Bugs Bunny, asking viewers, \"Ain't I a stinker?\" with conspiratorial glee.\n\nThe supporting cast is stacked with heavy hitters, who all ably bring immediacy and energy to their roles. Kristin Scott Thomas nicely intimates the insecurity that would lead a strong woman like Lady Anne to marry Richard, who already killed both her father-in-law, King Henry VI, and her husband, Prince Edward. Nigel Hawthorne is tremendously affecting as the Duke of Clarence, Richard's brother who wrongly believes in his brother's love, even as Richard's henchmen are about to do him in. Maggie Smith is typically grand as Richard's mother, who despises him as she would a disease. Jim Broadbent is suitably slimy as Richard's conspirator, the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nOnly the American members of the cast seem slightly out of step. Neither Annette Bening nor Robert Downey, Jr., embarrass themselves as Queen Elizabeth and her brother Lord Rivers, but the Shakespearean dialogue can't help but feel labored and ill-fitting. Still, their exquisite unspoken reactions to Richard's awfulness more than justify their appearances in the film.\n\nThe look created by production designer Tony Burrough, costumer Shuna Harwood, and cinematographer Peter Biziou is suitably opulent but still nicely restrained. Even once Richard starts dressing like a black-clad, jackbooted instrument of malevolent totalitarianism, and elements of Nazi imagery overtake the decor, the filmmakers feel confident enough to let the stylistic shift occur without drawing focus to comment about the change.\n\nMcKellen, Loncraine, and their collaborators have clearly put a lot of serious consideration into the text and how to most vividly bring it to life for a new audience. Surprisingly, the filmmakers adapt Shakespeare as though they were adapting a best-selling novel, with the main idea not being to protect a sacrosanct old text but to make the best movie of the material. I don't mean to suggest that this version is dumbed down or mindless, but you surely don't need to be a Shakespeare scholar to appreciate why this film is razor-sharp, darkly funny, and undeniably exciting.\n\nThe Blu-ray\n\nRichard III has been released in a limited edition of 3000 copies. The disc is accompanied by a full-color booklet, featuring an essay by Twilight Time's Julie Kirgo.\n\nThe Video:\n\nThe AVC-encoded 1080 2.35:1 transfer presented here is awfully good. The image is consistently clean, with a satisfying film-grain texture. Colors are bold without looking over-saturated or bleed-y. There's just a touch of digital noise here and there, but it's pretty negligible.\n\nThe Audio:\n\nThe DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround audio is defect-free and well-mixed. Scenes of warfare have a satisfying full-range attack, while the music is also well-served by the surround speakers. The dialogue is clean and clear and always intelligible. The disc offers one subtitle option: English SDH.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n- The score by Trevor Jones is offered in a nice DTS-HD MA 2.0 mix.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nIt can be a tricky proposition to modernize Shakespeare while sticking to the original written words. This version of Richard III not only avoids feeling stilted, it is positively invigorating. This new Blu-ray offers a strong-looking and great-sounding remaster.

One by Xavier de Jarcy entitled: Le Corbusier, a French fascism (Le Corbusier, un fascisme fran\u00e7ais) and another by Fran\u00e7ois Chaslin with the title: A Corbusier (Un Corbusier).\n\nA picture of Le Corbusier with his distinctive round spectacles can be found in most Swiss wallets, displayed on the face of the Swiss 10 franc note.\n\nThe timing of these books is awkward. This year is the 50 anniversary of Le Corbusier's death in 1965. In addition, there is a commemorative exhibition of his works at Le Centre Pompidou in Paris, which some say glosses over his fascist past.\n\nThe books reveal close friendships with fascists and members of the Nazi sympathizing French Vichy government including the French revolutionary fascist party leader, Dr. Pierre Winter.\n\nLe Corbusier's role as an urban planner for the Vichy government was already well known, however revealed letters show that he was more than just an opportunist, as some had assumed. In one letter he describes the fall of France to the Nazis in 1940 as \"the miraculous French victory\". Later he describes the big \"clean up\" in preparation. \"Money, Jews (partly responsible), Freemasons, all will face justice. These shameful fortresses will be dismantled. They dominate all.\"\n\nRegarding Hitler he wrote: \"we are in the hands of a victor...Hitler could crown his life with a magnificent feat: the clean up of Europe.\"\n\nSome who don't like his architecture have jumped on these revelations and used them to explain the defects they see in his designs. Certain critics consider Le Corbusier's famous Cit\u00e9 radieuse in Marseille, built after the war in the 1950s, to be the inspiration for oppressive modern state housing blocks built to house the poor. In this style of architecture, they say they see echoes of fascism, totalitarianism and the ghetto.\n\nThe curator of the Le Corbusier exhibition in Paris defends Le Corbusier's architecture in an interview with Sarah Elzas of RFI. He says that modern housing estates are designed with financial motives and leave out many of the elements of Le Corbusier's original designs such as large windows and balconies. Inside the concrete buildings of the Cit\u00e9 radieuse there are schools, gyms and shops. It is like a mini city, a community.\n\nThe commemorative exhibition at the Pompidou Centre in Paris has been accused of glossing over this controversial period of Le Corbusier's life. The museum responded by saying an exhibit in 1987 covered works from all periods of his life. In the same interview, the curator describes Le Corbusier's relationships as professional opportunism.\n\nIt is likely that the controversy surrounding the man, Le Corbusier, and his architecture will continue for a very long time.\n\nNow when we open our wallets and pull out a Swiss 10 franc note we might wonder what the face on the note really stands for. More likely though, we'll hand it over, collect our shopping and hurry on our way without even noticing.", "WASHINGTON -- \"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS).

When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality, it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous \"JFK\" will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" vs. the real T.E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. \"Wolf Hall\" is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce \"A Man For All Seasons.\" I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?\n\nCharles Krauthammer writes for The Washington Post.", "National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Lai Mohammed\n\nThe All Progressives Congress on Tuesday upturned the ban placed on the Africa Independent Television by the security team of President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBuhari's team had on Monday placed a ban on the media crew of the AIT, citing security concerns as well as ethical issues.\n\nBut the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in a statement in Abuja, said all accredited media organisations, \"including AIT,\" are free to cover the President-elect's activities.\n\nThe APC said the incoming Buhari administration would not discriminate against any media organisation irrespective of its role during electioneering.\n\nThe party however enjoined all media organisations to observe the highest level of professional standards in carrying out their duties.\n\nThe party said, \"There is a Code of Ethics guiding the practice of journalism in Nigeria, and this demands every journalist to ensure a strict adherence to the highest levels of ethics and professionalism in carrying out their duties.\n\n\"There must be repercussions, within the realms of the law, for media organisations which have wantonly breached the Code of Ethics of the journalism profession and turned themselves to partisans instead of professionals. But such repercussions will not include barring any accredited media organisation from covering the activities of the President-elect.\"\n\nThe Buhari team had asked the AIT crew to steer clear of the President-elects' events until issues relating to its alleged unethical conduct in the run up to the general elections had been resolved.\n\nThe action had also attracted reactions with many citizens taking to the social media to condemn the ban on the privately-owned television station.\n\nMr. Richard Akinnola, a veteran journalist and social critic, asked Buhari to \"immediately rescind the directive barring AIT from covering your activities.\"\n\nAkinnola argued that while AIT might have acted unprofessionally during the campaigns, \"it is very wrong to bar them from covering activities.\"\n\n\"Though you have not been sworn-in, you are no longer a private citizen and every media house has the constitutional duty to report the activities of the President-elect. If you have any security or ethical concerns, please direct them to the relevant bodies,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday described the ban on the television station from covering the activities of Buhari as unacceptable.\n\nThe PDP said the ban was a sign of danger for the nation's democracy.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Olisa Metuh, in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday, said the action was not only unjustifiable \"but also unconstitutional and completely against the spirit of liberty and the rule of law in a democracy.\"\n\nHe said, \"The PDP as a party that have nurtured the nation's democracy in the past 16 years cannot afford to fold its hands and watch the constitutional rights, media freedom and personal liberty of Nigerians, the basic tenets of democracy being demolished.\n\n\"We ask, is this a beginning of the feared erosion of the freedom and personal liberty the media and Nigerian citizens have been enjoying in the last 16 years under the PDP-led administration?\n\n\"Has our dear nation finally fallen into the clutches of totalitarianism and impunity where government actions will be based on egocentric decisions and impulses of individuals rather than the rule of law?\n\n\"While we assure the President-elect of our resolve to run a mature and responsible opposition based on issues, we are disturbed by this emerging development and reassure the Nigerian people that we will continue to stand with them on issues of democracy and freedom at all times.\n\n\"Perhaps, we need to remind General Buhari that part of the challenge of his new position, even as President-elect, is that he has lost his private life which is now subject to public scrutiny and media interrogation, as required of the custodian of the mandate of the Nigerian people.\"\n\nMetuh said his party was not oblivious of the background of the President-elect, especially as it relates to the freedom of the media, but that he thought that having declared to be a converted democrat Buhari would make himself amenable to the basic principles of democracy by following the due process of the law on any circumstance.\n\nHe added that the retired general might also wish to be reminded that the Nigerian Constitution, based on which he emerged as President-elect, also gave the media powers to cover activities of public office holders while at the same time providing legal avenues for redress in the event of any violation.\n\nHe said, \"If the right of the President-elect was in anyway violated by the AIT or any media house for that matter, he is expected to act within the law and seek redress in the courts, otherwise one would have no option than to conclude that he is out for personal vendetta.\n\n\"The APC and the President-elect may have one or two lessons to pick from President Goodluck Jonathan, who though the most-maligned and abused President in the history of our nation, even by the APC, allowed his actions to be sufficiently guided by humility, tolerance and the rule of law\".\n\nMetuh called on Nigerians not to despair but to remain steadfast and unite in resisting any anti-democratic tendencies intended to instil fear in them and set the stage for a dictatorial order and the erosion of their personal freedom and liberty as citizens.", "The Hunger Games (2012), directed by Gary Ross\n\nHave you guys heard of this one? It's some small indie film I think that opened on a few screens this past weekend. No big deal. Or it's one of the biggest movies of the year that made a tonne of money at its midnight screenings on Friday and a tonne more over the rest of the weekend. I went to the theatre Thursday night to see something else and wondered why all these weird looking teenagers were lined up around the block. And then went 'ohhhhhh right. Hunger Games.'\n\nI try to make a point of following these cultural phenomena, even if I don't understand them. Last year, for instance, I watched all the Twilight films over a weekend. I haven't been the same since, but I did it all for you dear readers. It's been the same with The Hunger Games. Yes, I have read all the books. No, I did not fall head over heels in love with them. I like the story but didn't care for the writing and overall thought they were pretty good but not amazing. I expected even less from the movie.\n\nI gotta say though, despite all the critical backlash, The Hunger Games is a pretty darn good movie. If you were to get a couple of drinks in me I might even go so far as to say it's better then the book. But I'd say a lot of things at that point.\n\nAs far as a book to screen conversion goes, the movie, of course, trims a lot of the fat of the book, which may disappoint some. Gale gets a little short changed and is reduced to mainly a few reaction shots to the Hunger Games broadcast. Man looks good smiling in a crowd though, gotta say.\n\nI general though I like what they kept. We get a nice build up to the actual games and a good, if not condensed, version of the lives of people in District 12 and our main characters. The film did a good job of bringing to life the world that was somewhat inadequately described and hard to visualize in the book. The games themselves are exciting but horrible. It's an enjoyable movie to watch.\n\nThe film is a bit easy. I never felt challenged at any point. I never felt it was making any insightful comments on our own society and the dangers of totalitarian rule or on the relationship between humans and violence. I felt sorry for the tributes but because the violence was fairly glossed over I never got a full sense of the brutality of the games. Teenagers are hunting and killing other teenagers, but it still played out as an exciting movie, the very thing the story seems to be criticizing.\n\nI like Jennifer Lawrence. As with everyone else, she blew me away in Winter's Bone. It was exciting to see a young, mature, talented actor emerging. This is her big breakout role. Not a whole lot of people saw Winter's Bone, so for them this, and X-Men: First Class, is their introduction to this very talented woman.\n\nWhat makes this performance stand out though is that Katniss is not a flashy role. Throughout the Hunger Games series she is a serious young woman who has trouble garnering sympathy from people and refuses to try and make people like her.\n\nLawrence nails it. She hardly smiles throughout the whole movie but when she does it's an event. And that's the way it should be for this character. She is not your typical movie hero. She is divided and confused and damaged. She does not want to be in the situation that she is but is dragged into her role as rebel icon. You can see this conflict in Lawrence's performance.\n\nHere's my main complaint with the movie, and it's one you might hear out of me from time to time when I feel like harping on it: too much shaky, handheld camera work. This is seemingly the only way we know how to film action nowadays, and while I can appreciate the immediacy and chaos of it in the right situation, when I can't tell what's happening in the most important fight of the movie, that's a problem.\n\nAt some points I felt a little motion sickness to be honest, such is the amount of jerky, swinging camera work in the film. At times it worked, but for the most part it was so overused it felt unnecessary. Do I really need the reaping to look like something someone shot on their cellphone and put up on YouTube? This is a proper movie here, use a tripod for heaven's sake. I get the theoretical ideas behind this approach (immediateness, creating a sense of unease in the audience) but it's a cheap and lazy move.\n\nAll told, however, I enjoyed The Hunger Games far more then I thought I would and I think the filmmakers did a better job then they are getting credit for. Could it have been better? Yes, absolutely. Could it have been worse? Very much so. The movie they did make is nothing revolutionary (pun intended) or anything we haven't seen before (this is an exact remake of The Running Man, right? Kidding.), but still a heck of a good watch in a crowded movie theatre. I look forward to the sequels.\n\nFor a more detailed and passionate analysis please consult someone 14 years old.\n\nThe Hunger Games is in theatres now.", "Wolf Hall, the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS). It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd Wolf Hall's revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (\"the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people\"), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt's beautiful and hagiographic A Man for All Seasons.\n\nWolf Hall's depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse.\n\nWho's right? Neither fully, though Wolf Hall's depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons, but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.\n\nIndeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More's persecution of Protestants. Wolf Hall's depiction of Cromwell as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.\n\nNonetheless, Cromwell's modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance's brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps, too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.\n\nWhich Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry's Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries, and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today's reflexive anticlericalism. But we do well to remember that the centralized state Cromwell helped midwife did prepare the ground, over the coming centuries, for the rise of the rational, willful, thought-controlling, indeed all-controlling, state.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed. And while suppressing one kind of intolerance, they did little more than redefine heresy as an offense against the sovereignty not of God but of the state.\n\nHowever, Wolf Hall poses questions not just political but literary. When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous JFK will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia versus the real T. E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. Wolf Hall is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce A Man for All Seasons. I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?", "Official picture of CryptoRave 2015, with organizers, activists, and guests. (Actantes)\n\n\"From the war on terror to cyberwars.\" Inspired by various cryptography events around the world, this was the motto for CryptoRave 2015. The event provided over 35 activities to the public in S\u00e3o Paulo, surpassing the previous year in quality and quantity. Demonstrating the force of Brazilian activists and groups, more than 2,000 people congregated at the Centro Cultural S\u00e3o Paulo on April 24-25 for conferences, hacking, installation fests, and open tables to discuss Brazil's debate on Marco Civil, net neutrality, and other privacy and surveillance topics.\n\nWith more than 600 people gathered on Friday, April 24 for the CryptoRave, EFF's international policy director, Katitza Rodriguez, and Andre Meister, an investigative journalist from Netzpolitik, kicked off the event with a keynote speech titled, \"Mass Surveillance and Social Control.\" Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at EFF, followed with a speech called \"Threat Models: What you need to know.\" Also in attendance were Peter Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay, and Micah Anderson of the LEAP Project.\n\nDuring the event, EFF talked with several activists from Brazil about the importance of cryptography and its implications in the context of public debate, as well as concerns regarding privacy and freedom online.\n\nLucas Teixeira, Oficina Antivigilancia:\n\nCryptoRave shows that many people are interested in these issues, not just people with technical or mathematical skills. Cryptography is not a crime, it's a fundamental right that people deserve to have in the physical world. People are advocating for privacy protections for their phone conversations...because if governments and companies don't have the right to enter our houses and record what we do, our online conversations should not be surveilled either.\n\n\"Amarela,\" Tem Boi Na Linha:\n\nActivists and journalists have clear privacy concerns because they don't have the privacy to work and strategize; but ordinary people are also being monitored and they are worried. I, for example, think twice before making a query in search engines.\n\nLatin American governments are exploring the fields of digital mass surveillance, which is why surveillance laws are being passed. In Brazil, we have movement from civil society that is united; when surveillance laws are proposed, we at least slow them down...Governments will advance in surveillance, and people must organize to stop it. Events like CryptoRave have to keep going on, grow and involve more countries.\n\nPeter Sunde, co-founder and ex member of The Pirate Bay:\n\nWe usually compare cryptography to a prophylactic, because if you are having sex, you don't want to be unprotected. You know there are diseases, so we need prophylactics, and encryption is sort of that...it protects you and it protects the person you're with, so you should use them. But you should also educate the other people about the use of this prophylactic called encryption. Then we should focus on actually getting rid of the disease itself, so like stopping the surveillance. We're going to have to use these prophylactics for a while, but also can't give up on making sure that governments and companies stop spying on us...the battle is two-fold.\n\nAndre Meister, investigative journalist of Netzpolitik:\n\nIt is great to see so many people spend their weekend and Friday night not partying, but nerding at this event. Pre Snowden there was no such thing, it was a tiny scene of the usual suspects but now everyone seems to realize that privacy is important and we have to defend it. A way to do that is with cryptography, and we're teaching people to encrypt basically all the things, but that cannot be all. Crypto is only a defensive strategy against what's happening out there, we need to fight for a world where crypto isn't necessary! In my keynote, I presented the levels on which we have to fight, like technical, political, media levels...we have to inform people, find more information about what is actually going on, and fight for a world without surveillance, for freedom of thought and assembly without having to use crypto.\n\nWhen I was here three years ago, pre Snowden, friends of mine organizing a similar event said \"in Brazil no one cares about privacy, except corrupt politicians and celebrities.\" After Snowden there seems to be more people, political activists, average users, and journalists who discovered that privacy is being breached all the time and that they are surveilled all the time and should do something about it. Still, Brazil is the fifth biggest country in the world and there's only a few hundred people here, we can do more, educating people to get the word out.\n\nFernanda Becker, Actantes:\n\nWe need to have broader discussions on the right to privacy as a cornerstone of other rights, and a dimension of our own autonomy to make our own decisions.\n\nFernanda Shirakawa, Escola de Ativismo:\n\nIn Brazil we have several threats, and with mass surveillance, all are exposed. The Marco Civil da Internet helped to minimize them a bit, but there are still several loopholes where we see an invasion of privacy with geolocation information; the data protection regarding what data companies have on everyone...people don't know about it.\n\nS\u00e9rgio Amadeu, professor UFABC:\n\nWe have to spread a culture of privacy defense. One of the biggest security problems in the world is that corporations and governments are destroying privacy, and with no privacy there cannot be a democratic society. Mass surveillance leads to authoritarian processes, self-censorship, and even totalitarian processes. When someone already uses cryptography, it shows that they have a concern for secure communications; he worries enough to combat mass surveillance or at least not allow companies to take control. The use of cryptography is a technical action which also has a major political impact in times of mass surveillance, human rights violation, and data interception.\n\nIf we had thousands of people in Brazil, let's say 30,000, using cryptography daily, we would greatly damage the mass surveillance system. With strong crypto, the cost of breaking these encrypted messages is much higher than with normal messages.\n\nJamila Venturini, member of Centro de Tecnolog\u00eda y Sociedad FGV Rio\n\nIt is important to see people of different ages and spaces here. My impression is that there are groups who are not controlling their privacy, so they must be prepared to control their own personal information. In Brazil, there are concrete threats of freedom of expression against bloggers, which are directly related to privacy.\n\nEFF hopes to see more events like the CryptoRave, not only in Brazil but in more countries, because ending mass surveillance is everyone's commitment.", "The All Progressives Congress overrules the decision by the handlers of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, president-elect, to stop The African Independent Television from covering his activities\n\nAMIDST the outcry generated by the move to stop the African Independent Television, AIT, on Monday, April 27, from covering the activities of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, president-elect, the All Progressives Congress, APC, has swiftly dismissed the action as untrue. APC's statement came in the wake of the alarm raised by the Peoples Democratic Party, journalists and prominent Nigerians over the threat to undermining press freedom.\n\nA statement issued by Lai Muhammed, spokesman of APC, said that accredited media organisations in the country, including African Independent Television, AIT, were free to cover the activities of the president-elect. According to Mohammed, the incoming Buhari administration will not discriminate against any media organisation, irrespective of its role during the electioneering campaign leading up to the recent polls.\n\nHe, however, enjoined all media organisations to observe the highest level of professional standards in carrying out his duties. \"There is a Code of Ethics guiding the practice of journal ism in Nigeria, and this demands every journalist to ensure a strict adherence to the highest levels of ethics and professionalism in carrying out his duties. There must be repercussions, within the realms of the law, for media organisations which have wantonly breached the Code of Ethics of the journalism profession and turned themselves to partisans instead of professionals. But such repercussions will not include barring any accredited media organisation from covering the activities of the president-elect,'' APC said.\n\nNonetheless, Olisa Metuh, spokesman of PDP, on Tuesday, April 28, said \"after carefully studying the defense posited by General Buhari's campaign spokesperson as well as the statement by the APC to cover and mitigate his anti-media posture, the PDP and indeed all lovers of democracy are persuaded that the action was not only unjustifiable, but also unconstitutional and completely against the spirit of liberty and the rule of law in a democracy.\"\n\n\"The PDP as a party that has nurtured the nation's democracy in the past 16 years cannot afford to fold its hands and watch the constitutional rights, media freedom and personal liberty of Nigerians, the basic tenets of democracy being demolished. We ask, is this a beginning of the feared erosion of the freedom and personal liberty the media and Nigerian citizens have been enjoying in the last 16 years under the PDP led-administration? Has our dear nation finally fallen into the clutches of totalitarianism and impunity where government actions will based on egocentric decisions and impulses of individuals rather than the rule of law?\n\n\"While we assure the president-elect of our resolve to run a mature and responsible opposition based on issues, we are disturbed by this emerging development and reassure the Nigerian people that we will continue to stand with them on issues of democracy and freedom at all times.\n\n\"Perhaps, we need to remind General Buhari that part of the challenge of his new position, even as President-elect is that he has lost his private life which is now subject to public scrutiny and media interrogation, as required of the custodian of the mandate of the Nigerian people\", Metuh said.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP is not oblivious of the background of the president-elect especially as it relates to the freedom of the media, but we had thought that having declared to be a converted democrat, he would make himself amenable to the basic principles of democracy by following the due process of the law on any circumstance.\"\n\nSimilarly, Olu Adegboruwa, a lawyer, said barring AIT was totally unacceptable, unpalatable and dictatorial. It has no place in our new Nigeria.\" Citing the 1999 Constitution and African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, Adegboruwa said AIT could not be subjected to any treatment to which other news media are not subjected to. He said while his position is not to endorse the actions of AIT, any grievance against the media house must be dealt with in a manner prescribed by law.\n\n\"This decision is draconian and dictatorial, throwing us back to the very dark days of 1984, when the same Buhari gagged the press and threw journalists into jail. This decision is contrary to the manifesto of the All Progressive Congress, it is contrary to the campaign promises of Buhari himself and it is contrary to the laws of Nigeria and the minimum expectations of human development. In particular, Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution demands the press to hold government accountable to the people. How can the press do that, if they are subjected to such Stone Age rule and barrack practice of press guillotine? How can a president-elect chose which media outfit he will allow to cover his official engagements?\" he queried.\n\nAlso, Inusa Sule, publicity director of the SSPP, in a statement said the president-elect and the APC should be reminded that the 1999 Constitution as amended gives the press the right to hold government and its officials accountable to the people, therefore, urged all Nigerians of good conscience to stoutly resist the scare tactics of the incoming regime.\n\n\"The decision by the APC and the president-elect, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, to bar AIT from covering their events is unfortunate and a scare tactic against the media from putting the searchlight on the incoming regime. If the President-elect, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, feels strongly about the documentaries aired on him by the AIT, he should seek legal recourse against the sponsors and not to maul the station. The action demonstrates clear and present danger to press and media freedom in the country which any true and patriotic Nigerian should resist. The price of freedom and democracy is eternal vigilance. The action against the TV station coming barely 24 hours after the national publicity secretary of the APC lampooned the media as being lazy and lacking in credibility should serve as a warning that the civil liberties and unfettered media space created by the Goodluck Jonathan Presidency are in danger of being eroded.\"\n\nSimilarly, journalists who appeared on O and L late night Talk Show on AIT, described the incident as unfortunate. Gbenga Onoiga of the Nigerian Union of Journalist said that such action was undemocratic and must be guarded against, adding that he could not understand why Garba Shehu, spokesperson for the Buhari campaign, who was past president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors would let such happened.\n\nShehu was widely reported in the online media as confirming that AIT has been asked to step aside from covering Buhari citing security, ethical and family issues as reasons for the action.\n\nIt should be recalled that in his presentation at Chatam House in London during the political campaigns that, Buhari told the world that he had totally repented from his past dictatorial tendencies and that he would not subject Nigeria to any of his past undemocratic practices. But the recent action on AIT and NTA does not suggest so.", "(CNN)Most of us are happy with being flung around in a roller coaster or spun high in a Ferris wheel.\n\nThe rush of fear and the brief re-acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill.\n\nBut when does a theme park ride stop being scarily fun and start being just plain scary?\n\nWe\\'re talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling -- or a night of martinis -- can resolve.\n\nThe rides on which it\\'s not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes, but your entire life (plus some diced carrots that you have no recollection of eating).\n\nThese are the scariest theme park rides on Earth.\n\nThankfully, we don\\'t have to try them, because Stefan Zwanzger, aka the globetrotting Theme Park Guy, already has.\n\nAnd lived to tell the tale.\n\nThe rusty roller coasters of Pyongyang (North Korea)\n\nJust when life in a totalitarian state couldn\\'t get any more terrifying, North Korea unleashes some creaking fairground rides on its unsuspecting citizenry.\n\nTo be fair, the Kaeson Youth Park is a rare attempt to sprinkle genuine joy on the gray Stalinist cityscape of Pyongyang.\n\nThe fear here, says Zwanzger, is an emotional response in no way soothed by geopolitics.\n\n\\\"When you visit North Korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed, so you enter the rides wondering if they\\'ve been maintained at all since most were built decades ago.\n\n\\\"The cobwebs aren\\'t a good sign.\\\"\n\nZwanzger\\'s fear-free alternative: Kaeson has a relatively new, Italian-made Zamperla coaster.

It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd \"Wolf Hall's\" revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (\"the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people\"), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt's beautiful and hagiographic \"A Man for All Seasons.\"\n\nWho's right? Neither fully, though \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of More as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More-worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.\n\nIndeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More's persecution of Protestants. \"Wolf Hall's\" depiction of Cromwell as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.\n\nNonetheless, Cromwell's modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance's brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.\n\nWhich Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry's Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today's reflexive anticlericalism. But we do well to remember that the centralized state Cromwell helped midwife did prepare the ground, over the coming centuries, for the rise of the rational, willful, thought-controlling, indeed all-controlling, state.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed. And while suppressing one kind of intolerance, they did little more than redefine heresy as an offense against the sovereignty not of God but of the state.\n\nHowever, \"Wolf Hall\" poses questions not just political but literary. When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous \"JFK\" will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" vs. the real T.E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. \"Wolf Hall\" is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce \"A Man For All Seasons.\" I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?\n\nCharles Krauthammer's email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1zvoNRP", "I remember Martin Amis saying in an interview a couple of years before Tony Blair became prime minister, \"We're all Labour now.\" I think by \"all\" he meant all right-thinking people, and by \"Labour\" he meant opposed to the Tory government of the day. At the time I bridled a little at Amis's crazed inclusiveness - I wasn't sure I wanted to belong to a club that apparently accepted everyone as a member. Not, I hasten to add, that I could claim to be \"tribal Labour\". True, I'd voted for them in every election since I'd reached my majority, while my parents were vociferous, if not especially active, leftwingers.\n\nMy father, Peter Self, who was, oxymoronically, a \"political scientist\", wrote numerous books, which, while often technical in character, were nonetheless informed by his own rather gentle and utopian socialism. My mother, whose given name was Rosenbloom, grew up in New York in the 1920s and 30s and had run with a fairly racy crowd - one including a fair number of Communist party members. In the 1960s the family home in North London offered refuge for the draft-dodging children of her American friends, and I well remember her breathless account of the tumultuous 1968 demonstration against the Vietnam war in Grosvenor Square. A feminist before the term was in general use, in the 1970s she joined consciousness-raising groups and campaigns, and in the early 1980s she took part in the women's camp at Greenham Common.\n\nMy socialism, imbibed with my mother's milk and my father's ruminations, was at once of the same slightly wishy-washy oppositional character suggested by Amis's remark, and wreathed about by rather more dangerously seductive visions of the wholesale transformation of the social order by whatever means necessary. By the time I was at university and studying politics myself, I certainly understood there was a major problem with being a socialist: namely, the incommensurability of the means available and the ends desired. There were still quite a few Marxists at Oxford in those days - Terry Eagleton and his clique were seemingly bolted to the same table in the King's Arms the entire time I was an undergraduate - but while I was silly and naive enough to believe in the purifying, energising effects of violent revolution, I wasn't obtuse enough to think of dialectical materialism as anything more than a powerful heuristic. The grotesquely botched real-time \"socialist experiment\" that was the USSR was still under way, and in common with all right-thinking leftists I was quick to decry the excesses of Russian totalitarianism.\n\nHowever, before 1989 it was still possible to cleave to the idea of utopian socialism. A vision of the city on the hill could serve as an inspiration for piecemeal and incremental reform. In his essay \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\" (1891) Oscar Wilde puts this rather well: acknowledging the objection that his vision of a happy realm peopled by aesthetical and egalitarian individualists is impractical, he writes: \"It is unpractical, and it goes against human nature. This is why it is worth carrying out.\" Wilde was ever-dedicated to paradox - but this was one he sought to resolve with the familiar plaint: \"Human nature will change. The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes.\" As for the social conditions that obtain: \"It is exactly the existing conditions that one objects to, and any scheme that could accept these conditions is wrong and foolish.\"\n\nLooking back on my political activism of the 1970s and 80s, there was a lot of refusing to accept existing conditions on the basis that they were \"wrong and foolish\". We wouldn't accept the cold war and the threat of MAD (mutually assured destruction) underpinning it; we wouldn't accept the Thatcherite attack on the unions and the consequent privatisation of public enterprises; and we wouldn't even accept the testimony of our senses when we saw the people surrounding us whipped into an acquisitive frenzy by the City's Big Bang. I had been part of an anarchist collective at Oxford that published a free sheet, Red Herring - I'd bussed up to Liverpool to stand on the dockers' picket lines; I had the donkey jacket, the crew cut, the boots - and, most important of all, the attitude.\n\n***\n\nI must have first read \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\" in my teens, when I was going on Anti-Nazi League marches and sampling meetings of leftwing groupuscules in search of a congenial home. I never joined any of them, but I loved Wilde's essay - loved its uncompromising approach to the crushing problem of social and economic inequality, inequality I could see increasing all around me in the 1980s, while the economy began to be irrigated with funny money as manufacturing productivity declined in an inverse correlation to property prices. Wilde takes no prisoners from the very outset: \"The chief advantage that would result from the establishment of socialism is, undoubtedly, the fact that socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others.\" It's a very Wildean, quasi-epigrammatic reversal - the reader expects something worthy, collectivist and altruistic, instead he gets something that's irreverent, individualistic and apparently selfish. He goes on to extend his sympathy to those among the fortunate who are moved by the plight of the poor, before abruptly withdrawing it: \"... their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.\" It makes you wonder what he would have made of our Red Nosed era in which culture, charity and all manner of medical and social needs are kickstarted by rattling the begging box and chugging the small change of our compassion.\n\nI, too, have had a visceral hatred of charity - I, too, have agreed with Wilde in believing it demeans its recipients, while its chief beneficiaries are the donors, who by so giving are relieved of the burden of their own conscience. Even around the turn of the millennium, when I reread Wilde's essay, I still found it hugely to my taste. His refusal to abandon his high-flown and highly individualistic aestheticism in the face of \"the social question\" made him an avant-garde \"champagne socialist\". No one could've been more suitable for this role than he, who bubbled away his evenings in Simpson's in the Strand or the Cafe Royal, who spent royally when he had money and borrowed regally when he didn't, and whose contacts with the working class - with the exception of servants - were at once amatory and pecuniary.\n\n***\n\nI sometimes wonder when precisely I stopped thinking of myself as a socialist - as with so much else, I'd like to blame Blair for it; I'd like to tub-thumpingly decry his emasculation of the Labour party; his resistance to true industrial democracy; his personal greed and public duplicity - and, most of all, his enthusiastic participation in the Bush administration's self-deluding \"military interventions\". I think many, if not all, socialists of my stamp felt the invasions of Afghanistan and then Iraq as colossal shocks that exposed how bodged-up our belief systems really were. It was as if our consciences were forced into a bizarre PE drill, and Iraq was the vaulting horse we failed to clear. We leapt up, inflated by Robin Cook's ethical foreign policy - only to come crashing down crotch-first on Blair's hypocritical and leathery realpolitik.\n\nWilde says very little about an internationalist dimension to the socialism he proposes. Besides, his utopian socialism transpires not in any defined historical moment but in the sort of back-to-the-future society envisaged by William Morris in his neo-medievalist fantasy novel, News from Nowhere, which was published a year before Wilde's intervention. Morris sees little need to sort out the practicalities of his imaginary world. While its egalitarian individualists are free to indulge themselves in arts, crafts and social intercourse, the grunt work is done for them by mechanisation. Wilde takes the same line: \"Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt. All work of that kind should be done by a machine.\"\n\nIt seems strange to me now, typing this as I am on a machine assembled in the giant sweatshops of a nominally communist state, that Wilde could have been quite so optimistic about technology. After all, the evidence of what mechanisation was doing to people (rather than what they were doing with it) was all around him in 1891 in the form of maimed bodies and minds imprisoned by repetitive tasks. But then Wilde was writing a couple of decades before the terrifying ironic reversal of the first world war, which saw one era of globalisation terminate in the assembly line of death snaking across Flanders. He also writes: \"The very violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a moment,\" and we might forgive him this cosmically irresponsible silliness on the basis that the bloodbath of the Bolshevik revolution was in the future, too. Wilde wrote at a time when the oppression imposed by the moneyed on the poor was a form of violence, so it's possible to understand his revolutionary enthusiasm as part of a politics of ressentiment, whereby the slaves appropriate the masters' whip hand.\n\n***\n\nThe problem for all socialists who glorify the revolutionary moment - and let's not forget, violent revolution is absolutely integral to the Marxist worldview - is that once the shackles of social control are loosed, and the overseer's lash is seized, that lash begins to rise and fall indiscriminately. Wilde believed it was possible to engineer a completely egalitarian society populated by the naturally beneficent. Yet almost the exact opposite of what he writes about the mutability of human nature is the case: who among us, observing the absolutely reliable proclivity humans have for killing each other in the name of abstract ideas, can fail to conclude there's a streak of bloodthirstiness running through our natures like BRIGHTON through rock?\n\nWilde seeks to define the individual type of the coming socialist age: \"With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\" It might be argued that in rejecting the institutions of marriage and family, while taking himself - a quasi-closeted gay artist in hypocritical late-Victorian England - as the representative type of the coming age, Wilde was genuinely prophetic. After all, whatever else we may say about contemporary Britain, there's little doubt that many people perceive it as a society in which they can be themselves sexually, individually and creatively; that this self-realisation is fully articulated within capitalist metrics would presumably be shocking even to Wilde. Soothsayer or not, he never imagined the pink pound would become legal tender.\n\n***\n\nWith his hit West End plays and his extravagant lifestyle, Wilde was not only an early champagne socialist, he was also an early member of a nascent social class - one now known as the precariat. The modern characterisation of this class is that its members are insecure and shiftless - lacking either the job security and collectivism of the old working class, or the capital of the traditional middle class. Wilde, however, with his high earnings and his flamboyance, made of precariousness something aristocratic; he was, if you'll forgive the coinage, a precaristocrat. In the years since 1979, during which the old institutions conducive to socialistic thinking (if not socialism itself) have crumbled, hundreds of thousands have been press-ganged into the precariat. And, it needs to be said, some of us have done very well out of the new dispensation - we too are precaristocrats. How can I claim to have any solidarity with the less well-off when I've profited from precisely the economic conditions that make their lives so hard?\n\nNo, champagne socialism is a nonsense that was scarcely effervescent to begin with, and has long since gone flat. The champagne socialist's line that the poor should be raised to his level rather than he being reduced to theirs, is only an inversion of the neoliberal's crazed theory of wealth-creation, depending as it does on some mysterious mechanism of \"trickle up\". Without a willingness to forgo higher incomes right here and right now, and join the charmless and unrefined poor in their struggle for economic justice, the middle-class socialist's solidarity doesn't really amount to a hill of beans - let alone a hill of beans with a city on it. No, the champagne socialist, if he has any integrity at all, looks to a strongly redistributive progressive taxation system, because he understands - as De Tocqueville sagely observed - that the law exists to restrain our worst impulses, not encourage our best.\n\nWilde writes: \"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\" Yet for him, in his essay, the two are conflated, because for all utopians, no matter how anarchistic they may think themselves to be, the premise underlying their brave new worlds is that everyone cravenly become exactly like them - and while I myself am perfectly happy to emulate Wilde, I'm not sure being a flamboyant literary figure is likely to fulfil everyone's needs, nor lie within everyone's ability. No, I'm no longer a socialist if to be one is to believe that a socialist utopia is attainable by some collective feat of will - but I remain a socialist, if by \"socialism\" is understood an antipathy to vested interests and privileges neither deserved nor earned, and a strong desire for a genuinely egalitarian society. And that is why, for the first time since 1997, I will be voting Labour in a general election.\n\n* Will Self wrote the opening lecture delivered at A Wilde Weekend by Lough Ernest festival in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.", "Your article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided.\n\nBeing of a certain age and anticipating the Fiftieth Reunion of my graduating class from Erasmus Hall High School in May of this year I can admit, with all candor, that it has been quite some time since I was a student of either English or American history. That when told of this year's Law Day topic -- Magna Carta: Symbol of Freedom Under Law -- and encouraged to write an article, I had to \"hit the books.\" Well, the Internet, really. It is 2015! For truly, what could I say, without delving into the subject, about a document that has survived for 800 years; that forms, to a greater or lesser extent, the basis of the liberties that we, as Americans, direct descendants of the British legal system, hold so dear? And although we think, \"you can't teach an old dog new tricks\" (a statement belied by the activities of my own perky senior citizen pooch!) it was truly a pleasure to learn about the document that symbolizes the principle that no \"man is above the law.\"\n\nThe Great Charter was agreed to by King John of England, in a meadow at Runnymede, on June 15, 1215. It was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the Crown and a group of rebel barons. It is one of the most important documents in history. It guaranteed the people certain rights and bound the king to certain laws. Three months later it was declared invalid by the Pope but reissued, in a slightly altered form, the following year. Reissued several times thereafter, it is interesting to note that it was not until 1354 that Magna Carta's benefits were extended from \"free men\" to \"men of whatever estate or condition he may be.\" Although my research revealed nothing with regard to gender, it is hoped, by the president of the Brooklyn Women's Bar Association, the protections afforded by Magna Carta were extended to and meant to include women! Certainly, as time went by, they were.\n\nI was taken with the fact that an original Magna Carta traveled to the United States for the first time in 1939, so that it might be displayed as a part of the New York World's Fair. One can only imagine the security surrounding the crossing. The awe with which those fortunate to attend the Fair observed the document. But it is the continuation of the voyage that to me was the most interesting. For ultimately the Magna Carta and copies of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution found their way to Fort Knox for the duration of World War II. While tyranny, totalitarianism and dictatorship were rampant around the world, our sacred rights, as epitomized in these writings, that evolved one from the other, were kept hidden and safe. To be returned to their rightful places when the rule of law was secure.\n\nThis Law Day, as we celebrate \"Magna Carta: Symbol of Freedom Under Law,\" let us not take our freedoms for granted.

I attended seminary and ultimately earned a master of divinity degree as well as an MSW and a Ph.D. in public affairs. Since I have worked as a clergyman, social worker, gerontologist, policy analyst and educator. I did this with a BA degree in a field in which there were no jobs available without graduate degree preparation. That was in 1968. In 2014 little has changed. Students still get bachelor's degrees in psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, political science and a number of other fields and they find jobs by first getting graduate degrees in diverse field such as law, theology, urban studies, public administration, social work, public health and more. Others get Ph.D.s in psychology and anthropology and become researchers, archaeologists, consultants and mental health practitioners. The board of trustees at FGCU is considering eliminating degrees in philosophy, sociology, anthropology, economics and more. This is \"penny wise and pound foolish.\"\n\nThese are majors that will produce tomorrow's lawyers, economists, clergy, researchers, social workers, urban planners and more.

The Freddie Gray matter followed a pattern that has become all too familiar in the U.S. A young man from a minority community is arrested for trivial, or in the case of Gray non-existent offenses, has a brief interaction with the police and inexplicably suffers a resulting death. Anger in the community, largely resulting from generations of poverty, despair and violence at the hands of police acting as an occupying force, boils over into civil unrest that by and large displaces the original police misconduct as the focal point of the media's attention.\n\nThe Baltimore protesters were quickly labeled as \"thugs\" and \"criminals\" by various media sources. President Obama took a similar tact when he said, \"My understanding is you've got some of the same organizers now going back into these communities to try to clean up in the aftermath of a handful of protesters, a handful of criminals and thugs who tore up the place.\"\n\nRegardless of how one wishes to characterize the protesters, many of those commenting on the events in Baltimore attempted to create a false dichotomy in which legitimate criticism of the murder of a suspect while in police custody was somehow akin to supporting rioters and looters. Under this Manichean view, you either support the police who are the purported representatives of order, or you favor the protesters who have been characterized as anarchists, thugs and criminals.\n\nMedia personalities attempting to offer a more nuanced view have been roundly criticized. CNN's Brooke Baldwin cited in her reporting the fact that many police officers are veterans of U.S. conflicts abroad who view those in the communities they serve as hostile insurgents.\n\nWhile speaking with Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Baldwin recalled a conversation with a Baltimore City councilman about police officers not living in the communities they purportedly represent when she said that, \"I love our nation's veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don't know the communities, and they're ready to do battle.\"\n\nBaldwin's observation was immediately met with outrage and she quickly backtracked with an on-air apology. \"I absolutely misspoke,\" Baldwin said on CNN the following morning. \"I inartfully chose my words, 100%. And I wholeheartedly retract what I said. I have the utmost respect for the men and women in uniform. To all of you, I owe you a tremendous apology.\"\n\nWriter David Masciotra claims that Americans \"worship\" military members and police officers. He goes on to say that the kneejerk use of the term \"hero\" to describe such persons \"betrays a frightening cultural streak of nationalism, chauvinism, authoritarianism and totalitarianism.\"\n\nMasciotra further explains,\"Put a man in uniform, preferably a white man, give him a gun, and Americans will worship him. It is a particularly childish trait, of a childlike culture, that insists on anointing all active military members and police officers as 'heroes.'\"\n\nAs Masciotra points out, it has somehow been decided that we are going to label all police officers as \"heroes\" and meet with open derision anyone who dares to suggest otherwise. Never mind the inconvenient fact that it is statistically more dangerous to be logger or a fisherman than it is to be police officer. If someone dons a badge, we make them into a god in uniform.\n\nMuch of the knee-jerk worship of the police comes from allegedly conservative sources who routinely criticize a variety of public servants ranging from teachers to public health officials.. Yet criticism of the police results in the inevitable name calling and labeling of critics as \"libs,\" \"cop haters\" and \"criminals.\" The conservative ideals of limited government, freedom from government oppression and guarantees of liberty and due process suffer immediate defenestration when they come in conflict with what has become reflexive police worship.\n\nContrary to what most conservative profess to believe, they are vociferously supporting a group of government employees with a very strong union who enjoy incredible job security while earning extremely comfortable salaries and rather cushy retirement pensions, all funded by taxpayers. This same group of public servants is rarely held accountable for actions that would result in a lengthy term of imprisonment for an ordinary citizen.\n\nSomehow, even legitimate oversight and accountability of law enforcement is recast as \"hatred of the police.\" New York City Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch is among the most vociferous of those demanding blind worship of law enforcement. In Lynch's worldview, police are never wrong, critics are haters and even the most outrageous police misconduct must be unquestioningly defended. One of his favorite retorts to allegations of police wrongdoing is \"Police officers have civil rights, too.\"\n\nDespite the blind support given police from most conservative circles, there are those who have begun to question the propriety of this position. John Whitehead of the staunchly conservative Rutherford Institute has written extensively on the dangers of militarized police that place themselves above the law. Whitehead, author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People, writes that \"'We the people'\" have now come full circle, from being held captive by the British police state to being held captive by the American police state.\" The overarching theme of Whitehead's writings is that the State, through the police, are seeking complete obedience and compliance.\n\nIndeed, many reflexive police worshipers subscribe to the theory of \"comply or die.\" This line of reasoning holds that those who suffer at the hands of the police caused their injuries by failing to fully submit. Proponents of this canard claim that the victims of police violence and misconduct are they themselves to blame for in some way \"angering\" the police.\n\nManifestations of this were seen after the tragic murder of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police in various \"I can breathe\" shirts and signs. The message that \"I can breathe because I obey the law\" is anecdotal and absurd on many levels. The idea that being allowed to breath is contingent on one's obedience is not only insulting, but distinctly un-American.", "This blog post was written to coincide with the release of the film SAMBA (in cinemas 1st May) - a film that brings to life the struggles faced by immigrants in the often adversarial immigration process and in the integration in to society.\n\nWe live in an ever increasing hostile environment to immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees. The media and the government share responsibility for dehumanising this often vulnerable class. They seem to be no one's concern, let alone priority. They occasionally conjure up an outpouring of public sympathy but it takes the meaningless death of hundreds, if not thousands in a watery grave.\n\nI'm a solicitor who specialises in immigration, human rights and public law. My job title alone can be the source of controversy. There is the myth that \"only bad people need to rely on their human rights,\" the \"ordinary\" person does not. This is simply not true. In the United Kingdom, by way of pure luck we find ourselves in a stable country, we are not affected by civil war, warring factions, an autocratic government or totalitarian state. If we have a serious health condition we are lucky enough to be able to find the right treatment and support at home. What fluke of fate meant that I was born to parents in the United Kingdom and not to critics of the Assad government in Syria or political prisoners in Eritrea?\n\nI chose a career in law as I want to hold the government to account. The rule of law to me is sacrosanct. I chose a career in immigration law as I want to be able to help the most marginalised in society.\n\nOn an average day when I am not in court I will check my emails on the way in to the office. On arrival, over a black coffee I check the deadlines I have for that day and put together a to do list. I may have client meetings scheduled and so I plan my time for the day accordingly. I prioritise any court, Home Office or Legal Aid Agency set deadlines. My outlook reminders are a god send but also a constant reminder of the sheer amount of work I have to get through before home time. If I am in court or on a prison visit then it will be an earlier start and a large amount of waiting around time whilst waiting for your turn to go before the judge or for your client to be brought up from their wing.\n\nI have worked in immigration law for the last nine years. It has always been challenging and rewarding in equal measures. In April 2013 legal aid was removed for a large part of my client base, essentially for those who do not have an asylum or trafficking claim. It is the government's view that they are able to represent themselves. How such a view was formed when the government themselves do not understand their own laws, laws that are very often rushed through just to garner more votes from the anti-immigration masses, and not actually subject to the scrutiny of Parliament, is inconceivable. Immigration has always been a fast moving area of law, but given the extensive recent changes in particular in respect of Article 8 ECHR (where someone dares to rely on their right to a private and family life) the law is now labyrinthine. I have had clients weep inconsolably when they have been told that legal aid is not available as there is simply no way they can afford private fees and no way in the world they can represent themselves when the stakes are so high: if they lose, they and their children are forced to leave the country they now call home.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. I still feel a high when a result is achieved for a client, whether this is a grant of asylum or other form of status providing certainty and stability. There is no better feeling than when a client is released on bail and they are reunited with their family or where they are granted damages, compensation for their liberty having been taken from them by the state for no other reason than they were not lucky enough to have been born here.\n\nLike everyone else I am underpaid and overworked but it is important that the fight continues. Whenever I read a decision letter where it is obvious that the decision maker has seen my client, a person, a human being just like you and me, as nothing more than a number, a statistic to be massaged and manipulated to score points and win votes I know that I am in the right job for me.", "The marriage referendum is about changing marriage from a union of a man and a woman into the union of two adults regardless of gender who desire a lifelong commitment. Up to a few decades ago, the meaning of marriage as the union of two complementary sexes open to procreation has been unquestioned. In four weeks' time, it will be voted on and a majority opinion will determine whether one of the most natural aspects of humanity is going to be changed to suit a certain interpretation of equality.\n\nAs a people, we generally tend to be gentle, humane and loving. It is to this national characteristic, nurtured by its underlying Christian ethos, that the current political and media establishment is appealing.\n\nThe 'Yes' campaign, led by the Government and urged on by the media, is appealing to our emotions. The presentation of equality for persons who are gay touches the heartstrings of all, but especially the older generation. In this writer's opinion, this has had at least one positive result. It has helped to counter negative attitudes to same-sex people as persons of inherent dignity. Empathy is replacing what was at best nervous distance, at worse real homophobia. And that is good and welcome.\n\nBut there is an unpleasant undercurrent, that of intimidation. People who, in their heart of hearts, cannot equate same-sex unions with marriage fear being accused of homophobia. The few who dare to express their views in public have experienced an onslaught in social media. The most intimidated of all seem to be our elected representatives. It is incredible that the political parties have imposed the whip to get their members to support the \"Yes\" vote. All but one Senator submitted.\n\nIs the Catholic hierarchy also intimidated? The bishops will be anxious not to turn the referendum into a Church-State issue or to cause more offence to those most affected. Some bishops and priests are addressing their faithful directly in church; that is their right and duty. But Church encompasses more than the hierarchy, namely the laity.\n\nIrish people resent being bullied by either Church or State. Yet, ordinary citizens are being intimidated into voting \"Yes\". For over a year, the campaign waged by the Government urged on by the media has been relentless. In the final weeks, reason may triumph over emotion. As they prepare to vote, people will ask, reasonably: what are we being asked to change? The simple answer is: human nature.\n\nThis referendum touches the very source of our humanity. Human rights are at the heart of the Constitution. Article 41 recognises the family, based on marriage, as the fundamental unit group in Society. As such it has rights which are intrinsic to it, which the State is obliged to recognise and protect. In other words, the family, which existed before either Church or State existed, not only has a real autonomy within society: it is the ultimate source of society. Past and future converge in the family. Through marriage, future generations come into being. A nation's culture is passed on primarily through the family. Since the dawn of time, the union of man and woman was simply assumed to be the origin of the family. This is what we are being asked to change.\n\nThis is not only Church teaching. It is in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, art. 16.3: \"The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.\" That Declaration was drawn up against the background of two totalitarian regimes: Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union in particular, Marxist socialism tried to eliminate the family. This trend in Marxism -- condemned by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 -- was radicalised in Communist China in their \"one family, one child\" policy. The family has to be destroyed in order to exercise complete control over the people. The autonomy of the family is one of the bulwarks against every State's innate tendency to become totalitarian, our own State included.\n\nThough it is not primarily the State that is seeking to redefine marriage and thus the family, our Government is proposing that we introduce a profound contradiction into the heart of the Constitution. Instead of the Constitution's recognition of the family as having \"inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law\", the family based on marriage is being made subservient to the State. The notion of inalienable rights is often interpreted in legal circles as rights which one cannot oneself give up but they are in fact rights which are not given by the State; the State is under obligation to protect them. These non-negotiable rights are the measure of all positive law -- legislative or constitutional - because they arise from our common human nature, created by God. This is recognised by Article 6 of the Irish Constitution, which states that \"All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people\". The moral demands of our common human nature are known through conscience, the voice of God in our heart of hearts, if we but listen to it.", "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- You've got to like a pope who has read his St. Paul.\n\n\"To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some.\" -- 1 Corinthians, 9:22.\n\nThe chances are zero that the encyclical will be given ex cathedra -- which is to say, with an invocation of the doctrine of papal infallibility. It is certain to reflect the church's dictum that mankind exercise proper stewardship over God's creation, which is good general advice. But a wide array of policy responses could be classified as sincere efforts to follow good general advice.\n\nFrancis may throw in some specific policy prescriptions that he finds personally appealing, and he's certainly allowed. Of all the world leaders with bully pulpits, he's the one who actually does his work in a pulpit.\n\nHe's not a scientist. Usually, the lack of that credential is enough to get a person who speaks with the authority of what the data actually show hooted out of a discussion among climate-change true believers.\n\nHe's not even a \"climate scientist\" -- a totalitarian who seeks control over political and economic policy (and grant money) by scaring people who ought to have more sense.\n\nFrancis is a true believer in a Jewish carpenter who preached radical love for God and neighbor 2,000 years ago.\n\nJesus also changed water into wine, which is by no means analogous to changing data into propaganda. The former was a miracle. The latter is merely a trick -- and we can all see quite clearly exactly how the preachers of anthropogenic climate change do it. For the climate scientist, the miracle comes after the event, when someone proves willing to believe such patent nonsense.\n\nFrancis is a pastor -- a shepherd of souls. He's a guy who loves God, loves people and wants everyone else to do the same. He's a Catholic priest with a tremendous concern for the poor.\n\nHe's innocent as a dove. And though the media and his other natural opponents haven't figured it out yet, he's wise as a serpent. (Matthew 10:16)\n\nIn his brief tenure in St. Peter's chair, he repeatedly has employed a strategy of getting people's attention by saying things that seem rather unpopelike. Once they're listening, he follows up with the teaching of the church.\n\nNever in my lifetime have more people who are hostile to Catholicism gotten so caught up in what a pope has had to say -- especially about issues on which the church and the secular world are going in opposite directions.\n\nRemember when a reporter asked Francis about gay priests? Francis answered, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge? We shouldn't marginalize people for this. They must be integrated into society.\"\n\nA Vatican spokesman later explained that those weren't just Francis' sentiments, but rather the official teaching of the church, and that the teaching applies to all people of homosexual orientation, not just to priests.\n\nThe call to personal conversion -- \"searches for the Lord and has good will\" -- didn't get the play that \"who am I to judge\" did. But progress is progress: The media willingly spread the church's teaching and those who go looking for context will have no trouble finding the entire quotation.\n\nIt was a brilliant act of stealth evangelization, and it cemented Francis' media image as an extraordinary pope -- a religious leader who could be expected to make news worthy of a positive headline.\n\nNow the secular media find themselves eagerly awaiting the pontiff's every pronouncement, not with daggers drawn, but with eagerness to mine papal bons mots for \"radical,\" \"off-the-cuff\" expressions (of 2,000-year-old church teaching that reporters never learned).\n\nAn encyclical in which the pope might in some way endorse the views of the totalitarian left regarding climate change would be a big deal. The media, accordingly, are breathless with anticipation. But allow me to throw a damper on all of that. Here's the teaching of the church regarding good stewardship of the environment, beyond which Francis will not go:\n\n\"Each of the various creatures, willed in its own being, reflects in its own way a ray of God's infinite wisdom and goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every creature, to avoid any disordered use of things which would be in contempt of the Creator and would bring disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment.\"\n\nHow that works out in public policy depends on what's going on in the world. If we were facing climate disaster (which, of course, we're not), then the faithful would be called to make changes to solve the problem (which, of course, they can't, since whatever's happening to the climate is none of mankind's doing).\n\nIn the end, no matter what the encyclical says -- and my guess is it will say a great deal about the very immediate concern of making sure poor people have adequate food, water and shelter -- the nations will continue making political and economic policy according to what they view as rational self-interest.\n\nAnd in nations where the people play a role in determining the meaning of rational self-interest, Catholics will remain obligated to bring every ounce of their faith and their reason to the debate. Whatever policy side they take, Francis won't judge them.", "\"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS).

Eisenhower was the first to proclaim May 1 as Law Day, urged on by the American Bar Association. The date is significant because it was intended as a counter to May Day, or the day on which communism's false promise of empowering working people under totalitarian state control is celebrated in some parts of the world.\n\nThis year, Law Day comes amid significant reminders of why the rule of law is the cornerstone of peaceful, civil society.\n\nIn Baltimore, Maryland, protesters upset at what they perceive as official bias taking precedence over the rule of law took to the streets this week. What began as a peaceful protest became violent and destructive as some began attacking police, looting and setting fire to buildings.\n\nExactly what happened has yet to be determined, including facts surrounding the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. It seems safe to say, however, that what happened had something to do with a perception in that city, whether true or not, that laws are not applied equally or fairly. Also, what happened was a frightening lesson on the violent, arbitrary and unfair consequences of lawlessness.\n\nThe other proximate reminder this year is the 800th anniversary of the drafting of Magna Carta, which officially will be marked on June 15. Much has been said about this document, presented to King John by rebel forces at Runnymede. It is considered the founding document of the rights and liberties that are an honored part of many civilized nations and that served as an inspiration to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmong other things, Magna Carta, or \"great charter,\" guaranteed protections against imprisonment without cause or a swift trial; it limited taxation without a form of representation, and it protected church rights. It established a form of representative government that was to hold the king accountable for these rights. The charter itself evolved over many years. Originally, it concerned itself only with the rights of free men, primarily barons.\n\nBut, as University of East Anglia professor Nicholas Vincent has said, Magna Carta's most important contribution to the world is that it placed the sovereign state under the rule of law. In other words, a king, prime minister, president or other ruler cannot break the law without suffering consequences. In the United States, presidents have had to stand trial in the Senate under impeachment charges. Members of Congress, governors, mayors and even judges have been sentenced to prison for crimes, including corruption.\n\nA millennium ago, such a notion would have been considered absurd. Today it has made all the difference in societies where individual worth and potential can be realized.\n\nGovernments and societies are as imperfect as the people who run them. The United States has not always lived up to the ideals of a society governed solely by impartial laws. But those laws remain supreme, and dissatisfied people have plenty of peaceful means, including running for office, petitioning their leaders, bringing suit or using their rights to free speech and press, to correct wrongs.\n\nU.S. history is full of examples of how these methods, guaranteed by law, have led to remarkable changes and improvements. This is worth contemplating on Law Day.", "WASHINGTON -- \"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS). It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd \"Wolf Hall's\" revisionism is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic.

In June 2014, the group protested at the Grand Prix in Montreal. (Joel LeMay, QMI)\n\nNeda Topaloski briefly interrupted the business of the House of Commons yesterday -- forever entered into history as \"[disturbance in gallery]\" -- when she yelled out from the visitors' gallery with her objections to Bill C-51, the government's anti-terrorism legislation. Protests in the galleries are an occasional occurrence, but Topaloski's was widely noted for its topless nature -- Topaloski not only shouted, but bared her chest, on which was written \"C-51: State Terrorism.\" \"It's really scary to see that our system is using a real threat of terrorism that does exist in society currently to justify and excuse its totalitarian methods of repression,\" she says of a bill that she considers a threat to freedom of speech.\n\nTopaloski is a member of Femen, a movement that originated in Ukraine, which uses female nudity to protest various causes. (Its leader was recently speaking at a Copenhagen caf\u00e9 when the caf\u00e9 was attacked by a gunman.) A Quebec chapter was launched in 2012 and has since staged protests at Quebec's National Assembly, campaign events during the last provincial election and Parliament Hill.\n\nTopaloski herself has participated in protests during a Right to Life rally on Parliament Hill and at the Montreal Grand Prix. She says that among 20 supporters of Femen Quebec, there are about six women who typically go topless for the public protests. \"We think one woman can change the world,\" she says.\n\nI spoke with Topaloski today and the following is an edited and condensed version of that conversation.\n\nQ. How many times have you personally done these protests now?\n\nA. It's been a year and a half that I've been in the movement. And, personally, I would say maybe six times or something like that ... We had two actions [at the Grand Prix]. And before that I was at the Palais des congr\u00e8s in Montreal, during Stephen Harper's visit, to protest for indigenous women's rights, for murdered and missing indigenous women, and then a few other ones, once in New York with Femen leader Inna Shevchenko.\n\nQ. What inspired you to get involved?\n\nA. We are always objectified, of course, and women's bodies are used all the time to sell a million things and represented in a way that is always sexualized, and this movement really illustrates how a woman can take back her subjectivity and her body from the patriarchy and make it once again, as it always was and should be, her own thing and her own body in which she speaks for only herself rather than letting other people speak through her body to sell their products and things and ideas. So that's what inspired me. It seemed like the proper response, and, most of all, it uses the same imagery. The fact that we protest with our bodies and write things on ourselves and people still tell us that they still see us in sexualized ways and they tell us it's our fault, you know, women are objectified, so how, by using your body, can you be an answer to that? It just shows to what extent we only have one way of seeing women, so it seemed quite a proper answer. In one picture it plays with the codes that we are used to. And I just found it extraordinary. And I'd never seen women, young women, who scream so much and who never stop and who are not scared of the system. I have never seen that. So all of that seemed very visceral and very on point.\n\nQ. Had you been involved with protest movements before this?\n\nA. No, not specifically. I was always militant as a student and I went to protests, but nothing too extravagant.\n\nQ. Nothing quite on this level I take it?\n\nA. No, exactly. When you go to a protest and there are 3,000 people or 20,000 people outside, it's different than doing something on your own, exposed to all sorts of critics and exposing your body and being heard through your body -- it's different. It takes another kind of personal investment.\n\nQ. Is it scary to do that, to expose yourself like that?\n\nA. Well, no. No, it's not. Because when you look at it, everybody's taking it so seriously, but when you really look at it... it's absolutely non-violent and it just plays with the codes and at the most, it's funny, you know? How dare she do that? Why is she there? Why is it written on her? It's really funny to see people's reactions, and when people's reactions are extremely violent, that's when you realize to what extent there's unjustified [anger toward] of women who try to be liberated. Last year, there was an old lady who tried to beat us up with an umbrella at the anti-abortion protest. Some people really perceive it as something crazy when actually it's just a two-minute protest with a girl who speaks for herself. So I'm not scared. There's nothing to be scared about. I'm just me. I've always been me and I'm just shocked and surprised whenever I see that being me can cause such tremendous questioning.\n\nQ. Do you ever worry that the style of protest will overshadow what you're protesting?\n\nA. No, and the very fact that people ask this question shows again that... This is so ironic, we try to talk about issues, and people talk about our breasts all the time. And then people ask us, \"Well, why do we talk only about your breasts?\" Well, it's up to you to talk about something else, you know. There's nothing wrong or special with our breasts, and there's nothing weird about that either. It's not my fault that they have only been used to sell products. Now I'm guilty for giving my message and speaking for myself? No. Femen started as a protest movement that protested with our clothes on. And then nobody listens to women, nobody listens to women's protests, it's always marginal, it's not really society, it's just women. At some point, you realize there's only one thing that the system and patriarchy is interested in: women's bodies. You see it all around, so we decided to use that, but speak for ourselves and take back our bodies and identities and make them subjects, not objects.", "\"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS).

An exhibition of work by Polish artist Pawel Kowalewski in Tel Aviv addresses joint Polish-Israeli history and the trauma of the Holocaust.\n\nEntitled Strength and Beauty, the exhibition focuses on a group of beautiful, young women who endured and survived the Holocaust and raised families.\n\nThe exhibition features 10 large prints -- portraits of the women.\n\nBorn in Warsaw in 1958, Kowalewski took his first steps as an artist during Poland's transition from communism to democracy. In 1983, Kowalewski was one of the founders of Gruppa, a group of six young artists who rebelled against the communist regime in Poland. In 1991, Kowalewski founded an advertising agency, Communication Unlimited, in Warsaw.\n\nKowalewski is an Expressionist artist. His style is swift and intuitive, while his work spans various genres and is seasoned with humorous and ironic punch lines.\n\nThe exhibition follows the recent death of Kowalewski's mother, which impacted the artist in a big way. Zofia, who was not Jewish, lived in Warsaw and served as a soldier of the Polish underground during WW II.\n\n\"The memory of our mothers' generation and also an attempt to protect this memory are the main themes of this exhibition,\" says Kowalewski. \"The exhibition is also an attempt to reconsider the definition of true identity as well as the question of our readiness to know it. My exhibition is in fact in a perverse way about ... our readiness to grow up and accept the baggage and stigma of totalitarianism.\"\n\nThe photographs of the women who featured in the exhibition were taken from travel documents that were used by them during the war. Kowalewski then printed the images of their faces on large sheets of paper placed on aluminum (195 x 140 cm). He used a unique printing technique that incorporates three different colors, generating a special effect that allows each work to be seen differently from various angles.\n\nThe florescent color used by the artist will cause the figures to dissolve within a few months, ultimately leaving a dim trace of an image, concealed under an air-proof coating layer.\n\nKowalewski focuses on what exists beyond the visible spectrum, while he portrays his figures as mythical beings by gently and touchingly manipulating their esthetic image. As a feminist, he identifies a female voice and glorifies the great maternal archetype.\n\nKowalewski allows himself to adore the women who survived a horrifying plague of human evil by representing them as larger-than-life icons. Consequently, he rebels against totalitarian regimes and mocks their expected impact on the human psyche.\n\nThe Strength and Beauty exhibition of work by Pawel Kowalewski will be on view at The Artist's House in Tel Aviv from April 23 to May 16.y 16.", "\"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS).

If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?", "Len McCluskey this week praised Nicola Sturgeon and said that Labour should be prepared to work with the SNP. He isn't the only English lefty to fall for the charms of Scotland's First Minister. 'Can I vote SNP?' was one of the most popular Google searches among non-Scottish voters who watched the main leaders' debate at the start of the campaign. The effect has been similar to Cleggmania in 2010 with a rival party leader appearing to say the sorts of things many Labour supporters have longed to hear from one of their own. Why shouldn't they be attracted to the idea of Labour forming a progressive alliance with the SNP, Plaid Cymru, SDLP and possibly a Green or two? For very good reasons, as it happens.\n\nThe case against a deal with the SNP is usually made by Labour tribalists and couched in terms so self-serving as to be immediately discounted by its intended audience. The party might do better if it showed more self-awareness by acknowledging that there are valid reasons for people in Scotland to feel angry with it.\n\nThe argument for steering clear of the SNP isn't that Labour has a monopoly of progressive virtue. It clearly doesn't. The real reason for being a Nat-sceptic is that, aside from nationalism, the SNP has no ideological core of its own and simply instrumentalises progressive ideas to advance the regressive goal of separatism. For the non-Scottish left there can be no question of a principled and trusting relationship with the SNP because you can't build a common project for social change with someone whose first and only purpose is to smash up the political community to which you both belong. The left in England and Wales may want the UK to work differently, but they definitely want it to work. Nicola Sturgeon and her party want it to fail.\n\nThe SNP could have proved otherwise by refocusing its priorities on areas of shared interest with the rest of Britain when it lost the referendum, but it spurned the opportunity. Like true vanguardists, the self-styled '45' decided to set democracy and majority opinion aside and behave as if they were real voice of Scotland. Their pledge that the referendum would be a \"once in a generation\" event was immediately ditched in a frenzy of debate about how soon a rerun could be engineered and what ruses would be needed to secure a different outcome. Everything the SNP does is now framed with that solitary objective in mind.\n\nThe effect has been to foster a dominant attitude that is highly sectarian and trending towards totalitarian. There is only one truth and one way to be authentically Scottish - the nationalist way. Anyone who disagrees with this is, as one SNP parliamentary candidate put it, the moral equivalent of a Nazi collaborator. There is no space for pluralism and honest compromise with a movement in this state of mind. The normal rules of democratic conduct don't apply because it answers to destiny alone. When Nicola Sturgeon says that she wants to help the Labour Party, she does so in the same spirit that Lenin once advised his British followers support the Labour Party of Arthur Henderson: \"as the rope supports a hanged man\".\n\nThe SNP's progressive credentials don't, in any case, stand up to serious scrutiny. When Sturgeon was asked at her manifesto launch to name a redistributive policy enacted by the SNP in Holyrood, she was unable to cite a single example. There has been plenty of middle class welfarism, but no effective measures to reduce inequality or poverty. Indeed, the SNP in power has resembled nothing as much as New Labour in its pomp, combining the worst reflexes of authoritarian statism and market liberalism with a superior, \"we know best\" attitude that brooks no opposition.\n\nWith the creation of a single national police force, the routine use of armed response units, a stop and search rate four times higher than the rest of the UK and plans to create an integrated ID database, the SNP has strayed into areas that even Tony Blair's Home Secretaries backed away from. A new 'named person' law will create an army of state employed snoopers with a right to pry into the affairs of every family. The party has also taken a lurch towards democratic centralism with a new gagging rule that obliges its MPs to \"accept that no member shall within or outwith the parliament publicly criticise a group decision, policy or another member of the group\".\n\nThe SNP's 'business friendly' approach of sucking up to powerful tycoons like Donald Trump, Brian Souter and Rupert Murdoch is scarcely any better then Blair's cloying embrace of the super-rich, and arguably worse. The party's flagship post-independence economic policy of attracting multinational companies by slashing corporation tax and undercutting the welfare budgets of other countries is the sort of tax piracy beloved of the neo-liberal right. The SNP's claims to be anti-austerity have been revealed as baseless. Only opposition to Trident sets it apart; hardly an act of principle given that an independent Scotland wouldn't be able to afford nuclear weapons.\n\nAt a time when Britain is crying out for a politics of the common good, the SNP stands for a militant politics of sectional advantage. It is rapidly acquiring the characteristics of a political religion, a faith-based movement that vilifies unbelievers and subordinates all other considerations to the attainment of national 'rapture' through independence. This sets it apart from other parties, even Plaid Cymru which takes a more pragmatic approach to independence and has already worked as part of a coalition in Cardiff. There are good reasons for people on the left to want a new kind of pluralist politics, but it's no use pretending that you can pursue that vision with people who aren't pluralists. Short of a second referendum defeat, the SNP is likely to remain a belligerent and destructive force in British politics. Progressives beware.", "By Tim Dunkin\n\nThe events of recent months have emboldened the Gaystapo to plumb new depths of depravity. Not content with having the laws of the various States overturned by unelected federal judges for the benefit of the sexual lifestyle choices of a tiny minority, nor with the increasing persecution of business owners acting on their own deeply-held personal beliefs, the radical gay activists have upped the ante against those who disagree with them. In a story coming out of Guilford County, North Carolina, two church buildings in the past month have been vandalized with explicitly pro-homosexual sentiments, using spray paint as well as perpetrating other property damage. In an apparent attempt to silence opposition to gay \"marriage,\" radical homosexual \"activists\" (yet another euphemism for \"terrorists\") have left off of words and death threats, and taken to attempting physical intimidation.\n\nOf course, this isn't necessarily a new thing. For the past decade, radical homosexuals have been vandalizing church buildings, attempting to intimidate the congregations. In some cases, they have even gone further and tried to destroy the buildings outright. For instance, some of my distantly related in-laws living in Austin, Texas saw their church torched by radical gays a couple of years ago. However, the trend does seem to be accelerating in recent months.\n\nYou know who else liked to damage and destroy the houses of worship of those that they hated? The Nazis. True to the fascism that characterizes the \"progressive\" Left, radical homosexual activists are essentially letting their masks slip and revealing the true character underneath.\n\nWe shouldn't be surprised. While the Nazis were still struggling to come to power in Weimar Germany, there were actually many homosexuals in the ranks of their SA (Sturmabteilung), which was essentially the \"street fighting\" and \"intimidation\" wing of the Party, used to suppress opponents of the Nazis. Ernst Rohm, the head of the SA, was a homosexual, and he was so close to Adolf Hitler on a personal level (he was the only Nazi leader allowed to address Hitler as \"Adolf,\" for instance) that it was even rumored that Hitler was gay. It is not surprising that Rohm, before he was purged as a potential threat to Hitler's grip on the Party, was an advocate of the \"second revolution,\" which would have been a violent purge of Germany's \"reactionaries\" (Christians, traditional conservatives, and the like).\n\nHere in America, the Ku Klux Klan - thought by some scholars to be the earliest example of an organization devoted to fascism, sort of a \"fascism-before-fascism-became-popular-in-the-1920s\" - was also big on church burning, especially as a terror tactic designed to dissuade African-Americans from asserting their equality before the law during the civil rights movement.\n\nWhich makes it all the more ironic to see gay \"rights\" radicals claiming to be wanting \"equal rights\" (which gays actually already have) and \"equality before the law\" (even as they seek special favors from the law). Here's a pro tip for you: if you have to make your case by vandalizing and burning churches, then your case is not based on liberty or the law - it is based on violence, intimidation, and tyranny.\n\nYet, even should the radical gays continue to step up their terrorist campaign against churches, they will only find out the same thing that the KKK found out in the 1950s and 1960s - burning down buildings does not dissuade or intimidate those who meet in those buildings. Churches are not buildings and pieces of property. Churches are the people who assemble together into bodies of Christ, the members one of another. Damaging their physical property isn't going to make them stop opposing the Gaystapo's vile, anti-freedom agenda.\n\nIndeed, it may end up increasing and broadening the opposition. People can see who is in the right and who is in the wrong when one side has to start using violence to make its \"points.\" For the past few decades, the gay activists successfully hid their aggressive and hateful intentions behind a mask of victimhood. Now that they're getting a little taste of power, it's becoming increasingly apparent to more and more people just how corrupt they are.\n\nI've said it before and I will say it again - the gay agenda is completely, utterly, totally incompatible with American freedom and constitutional liberties. To the extent that the gays can wrestle more power to themselves, genuine liberties will be decreased. When one side gets to force the other side to do what it wants (like bake cakes or arrange flowers) even when this is contrary to the deeply-held spiritual beliefs of the victim, then you cannot say that you have a free society. You have a coercive society. You have lost liberty. You have become less free. You have taken another step toward the type of totalitarianism that the Nazis strove to implement.\n\nThankfully, the Nazi menace was ended. It is time for decent everyday Americans to stand up and oppose this new Nazi menace before it takes us down the path traveled in the 1930s.\n\n\u00a9 Tim Dunkin", "Goodluck Jonathan\n\nDespite the criticism surrounding his presidency, President Goodluck Jonathan will go down in history as an exceptional democrat with deep tolerance as his defining virtue, writes Ojo M. Maduekwe\n\nSome people had predicted that Nigerians will soon start to compare the administration of outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan to that of the President-elect Muhammadu Buhari and wish that the former were still their president. Only that none knew that the basis for comparison might be soon.\n\nBuhari's action, barring the Africa Independent Television (AIT) from covering his activities, in reaction to AIT's alleged partisanship during the just concluded 2015 presidential election has reminded many people of Buhari's first coming to power between 1983 and 1985, when as a military dictator, he clamped down on the press.\n\nCiting issues of \"ethics and standard\" Buhari on Monday, reportedly barred the AIT crew from entering the Defence House building to cover an official meeting between the president-elect, the Cuban and the Switzerland ambassadors as well as other guests. The spokesman for the Buhari Campaign Organisation said AIT was asked to step aside on \"security and family concerns\".\n\nAccording to Garba Shehu, \"Buhari has decided that they will have to resolve some issues relating to issues of standard and ethics. We will be talking with them to try and resolve the matter, but for now the station has been asked to stay aside because, like I said, there are some family and security concerns... You can quote me that I said that we have asked them to step aside and that we are resolving the issues of ethics and standards with them.\"\n\nDuring the campaigns and prior to the March 28 presidential election, AIT aired a series of documentaries said to have disparaged Buhari, his late wife and late daughter, as well as other prominent faces in the APC - an action likened to the infamous PUNCH newspaper front page advert sponsored by the Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose against Buhari.\n\nBut Buhari's action was greeted with widespread outrage. Professor of English at Carleton University, Ottawa Canada, Mr. Pius Adesanmi, took to his Facebook page and posted the following: \"You cannot ban or prohibit or prevent a media group from covering your activities never mind the unethical, stomach-churning jackass that AIT has been.\n\n\"In a democracy, the worst you could do is tactically 'freeze out' journalists and media groups making you uncomfortable. They still have the right to be there - and report things as they see it. If there are ethical breaches, there are appropriate institutions and channels to handle that.\"\n\nAnother reaction came from a prominent supporter of Buhari, Mr. Kayode Ogundamisi. In a series of 16 tweets on social media platform - Twitter - the social and political commentator went from narrating how \"AIT and Raymond Dokpesi's DAAR Communication is an outfit that played a monstrous role during the 2015 Presidential Election\" to \"General @MBuhari barring AIT is disappointing, the decision should be reversed...\"\n\nSeeing the Monday miscalculation by the president-elect, the APC on Tuesday in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Lai Mohammed, said \"There must be repercussions, within the realms of the law, for media organisations which have wantonly breached the Code of Ethics of the journalism profession and turned themselves to partisans instead of professionals. But such repercussions will not include barring any accredited media organisation from covering the activities of the President-elect.\"\n\nIt will be surprising if APC's correctional statement will change people's perception and suspicion about Buhari's perceived \"dictatorial\" tendency because, people voted for him and not APC and so will take more seriously Buhari's action over his party's reaction and attempt at correcting his gaffes. It is only when Buhari re-assures (assuming he does) of his support for press freedom that the suspicion his action has re-ignited can be doused.\n\nHis claim to being a former dictator turned \"democracy convert\", as well as his party's change mantra is already being questioned. \"Once a dictator, always a dictator,\" some have said. His action, aside the criticism also generated comments where some compared him to Jonathan, who is said to have displayed a calm demeanour whenever criticised, and in some cases ridiculed.\n\nBuhari, by his action barring AIT has shown himself as not only intolerant to criticism but also unable to follow due process. The change that Buhari and his APC promised was hinged on the strict observance of the rule of law. There are appropriate channels available to Buhari for seeking redress, including the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON), the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) or the court.\n\nThere are arguments in support of Buhari's action. Many of the masses who mimicked Shehu's excuse of \"security and family concerns\" have gone further to also argue that Buhari as president-elect was not yet the President of Nigeria and is still acting in his personal capacity, and for this can choose the television station he wants to air \"his activities\".\n\nNot only was Buhari on an official engagement, since he was meeting officials of the Cuban and Switzerland foreign ministries, the venue of their meeting, the Defence House, was not Buhari's private property, but an official building owned by Nigeria.\n\nBuhari's gaffe, irrespective of his party's reaction has woken and given tooth and claws to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), a once upon a time ruling party gearing up to become an opposition. Their reaction was a summation of the fears of millions, who have never believed in Buhari as a democrat or his party as the change that Nigerians need.\n\nPDP in a statement through its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Olisa Metuh, asked, \"Has our dear nation finally fallen into the clutches of totalitarianism and impunity where government actions will be based on egocentric decisions and impulses of individuals rather than the rule of law?\"\n\nThe party wasted no time in drawing comparison between Jonathan and Buhari: \"The APC and the President-elect may have one or two lessons to pick from President Goodluck Jonathan, who though the most maligned and abused President in the history of our nation, even by the APC, allowed his actions to be sufficiently guided by humility, tolerance and the rule of law.\"\n\nExcept for few instances where Jonathan was seen to have stood his grounds of rights in relation to press freedom, history will forever group him as one of Nigeria's most criticised and ridiculed president. But the lesson is in the fact that he remained largely calm and was not seen to be vindictive of any media, organisation or political party for criticising him.\n\nAPC's rise from an opposition to a ruling party was partly and largely because Jonathan took several bashing from them and did not go after the party and its members like some past leaders would have done. Even when the first lady was disparaged on several occasions, Jonathan never resorted to media suppression. His governance may have been poor and somewhat incompetent, but same cannot be said about his credentials as a true democrat.\n\nBuhari's action only goes to show that his media handlers may have succeeded in changing his wardrobe and given him a pair of glasses, but are yet to change some of his entrenched dictatorial tendencies, such as how he sees and handles the press; attitudes that saw to his failure and eventual toppling as military dictator.\n\nThe \"converted democrat\" may be nothing more than a smokescreen just for the purpose of APC winning the presidential election. And truly, for APC, winning still is easier.", "Fellow Texans, rest easy. Nobody is declaring martial law on our state.\n\nThis is a case of stating the obvious, but some people out there need reminding: Federal soldiers aren't going to kick the door down and take your precious firearms.\n\nAirborne sturmtruppen aren't going to parachute onto the roof. No one is going to dig up the yard in search of the gold coins you've got buried out there in a Miracle Whip jar.\n\nFriends, as much scintillating fun as it is to swap crazy talk around the ol' Internet campfire, enough is enough. If you're just pretending to believe that military training exercises planned for this summer are a smokescreen for a totalitarian federal takeover, you need to knock it off. And if you really do believe this -- no offense -- you are out of your gourd.\n\nThese are excitable times, though. Some truly bizarre speculation has boiled up around a planned U.S. special forces drill, a large-scale exercise called Jade Helm 15. The operation, involving 1,200 military personnel across seven Southwestern states, is scheduled to run from July 15 through mid-September.\n\nThis is what U.S. soldiers have done since they conducted musket drills at Valley Forge. They train, they exercise, they rehearse combat scenarios. This summer's series of exercises is intended to replicate the varied types of terrain troops may encounter in overseas combat.\n\nJade Helm is no secret. A U.S. Army colonel turned out for a public meeting Monday called by commissioners in Bastrop County to brief residents on what they may expect during the drills.\n\nIn an astonishing display of rudeness and disrespect, a vocal crowd of the local villagers turned out to insult and heckle the guy. They expressed their darkest fears about martial law and federal takeover. Some in the audience cheered when one speaker bluntly accused the long-suffering colonel of lying.\n\nAnd that's mild stuff compared with some of the lunacy being swapped online: ISIS guerillas will be brought in to enforce Shariah law. They'll be shuttled around through a secret network of tunnels linking (you think I'm making this up, don't you?) abandoned Wal-Mart stores.\n\n\"All we want to do is make sure our guys are trained for combat overseas,\" said Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria, with more patience and civility than much of his audience was due. \"We just want to hone our skills.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott's response to this nut-studded fruitcake of fear was unfortunate. On Wednesday, he directed the Texas National Guard to monitor the drills to reassure Texans that \"their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed.\"\n\nNever mind that American troops have been protecting those very rights for more than two centuries, and to suggest that they're part of a plot to overturn them is a profound insult to our military personnel.\n\nWell, I suppose Abbott's intention was to soothe these bizarre fears, to bring calm to these turgid conspiracy-crank waters.\n\nBesides, it's difficult to see exactly what the state guard is supposed to do here. A volunteer state force that is generally called on to respond to disasters and weather emergencies, they're being told to \"ensure that adequate measures are in place to protect Texans\" during the U.S. military maneuvers.\n\nAnd if there really were a sinister plan afoot, I don't know that I'd lay any bets on a corps of well-fed weekend warriors standing up to the most skilled combat troops on the planet.\n\nStill, it would be nice if Abbott had chosen a different response to these protests, such as: \"You need to quit behaving like a bunch of ninnies.\"\n\nHe could have said, \"Y'all need to find something more constructive to do with your time than slobber like Pavlov's dog every time some talk-show blowhard tells you the black helicopters are coming.\" He could have said, \"Knock it off, because you are embarrassing your state.\"\n\nAbbott did at least end his directive to the state guard with a bet-hedging sop expressing his \"utmost respect for the deep patriotism of the brave military men and women who put their lives on the line to fight for and defend our freedom.\"\n\nLet's join in hoping that the governor's response was a strategic error, that it wasn't meant to lend credence to delusional persecution fantasies.\n\nNext time, he needs to lead his remarks by expressing respect where it's due. And he needs to call crazy what it is.", "\"Wolf Hall,\" the Man Booker Prize-winning historical novel about the court of Henry VIII -- and most dramatically, the conflict between Thomas Cromwell and Sir Thomas More -- is now a TV series (presented on PBS). It is maddeningly good.\n\nMaddening because its history is tendentiously distorted, yet the drama is so brilliantly conceived and executed that you almost don't care. Faced with an imaginative creation of such brooding, gripping, mordant intensity, you find yourself ready to pay for it in historical inaccuracy.\n\nAnd revisionism of \"Wolf Hall\" is breathtaking. It inverts the conventional view of the saintly More being undone by the corrupt, amoral, serpentine Cromwell, the king's chief minister. This is fiction as polemic. Author Hilary Mantel, an ex- and anti-Catholic (\"the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people\"), has set out to rehabilitate Cromwell and defenestrate More, most especially the More of Robert Bolt's beautiful and hagiographic \"A Man for All Seasons.\"\n\nWho's right? Neither fully, though the depiction of More in \"Wolf Hall\" as little more than a cruel heretic-burning hypocrite is particularly provocative, if not perverse. To be sure, More-worship is somewhat overdrawn, as even the late Cardinal Francis George warned at a 2012 convocation of bishops. More had his flaws. He may have been a man for all seasons but he was also a man of his times. And in those times of merciless contention between Rome and the Reformation, the pursuit and savage persecution of heresy were the norm.\n\nIndeed, when Cromwell achieved power, he persecuted Catholics with a zeal and thoroughness that surpassed even More's persecution of Protestants. The depiction of Cromwell in \"Wolf Hall\" as a man of great sensitivity and deep feeling is, therefore, even harder to credit. He was cruel and cunning, quite monstrous both in pursuit of personal power and wealth, and in serving the whims and wishes of his royal master.\n\nNonetheless, Cromwell's modern reputation will be enhanced by Mark Rylance's brilliant and sympathetic cinematic portrayal, featuring a stillness and economy of expression that is at once mesmerizing and humanizing. The nature of the modern audience helps too. In this secular age beset by throat-slashing religious fanatics, we are far more disposed to despise excessive piety and celebrate the pragmatic, if ruthless, modernizer.\n\nWhich Cromwell was, as the chief engineer of Henry's Reformation. He crushed the Roman church, looted the monasteries and nationalized faith by subordinating clergy to king. That may flatter today's reflexive anticlericalism. But we do well to remember that the centralized state Cromwell helped midwife did prepare the ground, over the coming centuries, for the rise of the rational, willful, thought-controlling, indeed all-controlling, state.\n\nIt is perhaps unfair to call Cromwell (and Henry) proto-totalitarian, as some critics have suggested, essentially blaming them for what came after. But they did sow the seed. And while suppressing one kind of intolerance, they did little more than redefine heresy as an offense against the sovereignty not of God but of the state.\n\nHowever, \"Wolf Hall\" poses questions not just political but literary. When such a distortion of history produces such a wonderfully successful piece of fiction, we are forced to ask: What license are we to grant to the historical novel?\n\nFor all the learned answers, in reality it comes down to temporal proximity. If the event is in the recent past, you'd better be accurate. Oliver Stone's paranoid and libelous \"JFK\" will be harmless in 50 years, but it will take that long for the stench to dissipate. On the other hand, does anyone care that Shakespeare diverges from the record (such as it is) in his Caesar or Macbeth or his Henrys?\n\nTime turns them to legend. We don't feel it much matters anymore. There is the historical Caesar and there is Shakespeare's Caesar. They live side by side.\n\nThe film reviewer Stanley Kauffmann said much the same about David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" vs. the real T.E. Lawrence. They diverge. Accept them each on their own terms, as separate and independent realities. (After all, Lawrence's own account, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" offers magnificent prose but quite unreliable history as well.)\n\nSo with the different versions of More and Cromwell. Let them live side by side. \"Wolf Hall\" is utterly compelling, but I nonetheless refuse to renounce \"A Man For All Seasons.\" I'll live with both Mores, both Cromwells. After all, for centuries we've accepted that light is both wave and particle. If physics can live with maddening truths, why can't literature and history?\n\nletters@charleskrauthammer.com"]}}
