{"Samsung": {"2014-11-28": ["Tinged with protests and wintry weather, Black Friday still lured crowds into stores across the country, even as some shoppers expressed exhaustion over what has become a long, drawn-out start to the holiday sales.\n\nThe day that traditionally signified the start of year-end sales has become just another family shopping day, thanks to retailers that have already been discounting heavily in a bid to lift sales that have so far been tepid this year.\n\n\"Black Friday has turned into Black November,\" said Richard E. Jaffe, a retail expert at Stifel, the investment bank.\n\nEric Felton, 54, arrived at Tyson's Corner Center, a shopping center in Northern Virginia with over 300 specialty stores, about 3 a.m. As the morning began, the shopping center seemed more subdued.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's anything such as Black Friday anymore,\" Felton said. \"The erosion on Black Friday into Thursday has messed a lot of people up.\"\n\nCindy Leonard, who brought her 10-month-old to see Santa, said she arrived early, expecting to hit traffic. Then she quickly turned to her smartphone.\n\n\"I think everyone is avoiding Friday,\" Leonard said. \"I'm ordering the things on my phone that I couldn't find in Pottery Barn.\"\n\nAt Wal-Mart stores across the country, workers staged Black Friday protests, chanting \"Shut Wal-Mart down!\" and reminding shoppers that some employees of the nation's largest retailer rely on food stamps to feed their families.\n\nStill, Wal-Mart reported brisk traffic overnight. The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said that 22 million shoppers streamed through stores across the country on Thanksgiving Day. That is more than the number of people who visit Disney's Magic Kingdom in an entire year, the retail giant pointed out.\n\nTablets, TVs, sheets, children's apparel and video games were the top five categories of the night, and the Disney Frozen Snow Glow Elsa doll was a top-selling toy, Wal-Mart said. Best sellers online were video games, wireless prepaid phones, high-definition TVs and baby items.\n\nTarget said its best-selling goods in store were the Element 40-inch TV, the Xbox One, iPads and Nikon's L330 camera. In the first hour of its stores' opening, Target, based in Minneapolis, sold 1,800 TVs and 2,000 video games every minute, the retailer said in a release. Keurig's K40 brewer and Dyson's DC50 vacuum were other top sellers, Target said.\n\nOverall, about 140 million people are expected to shop in stores or online this weekend.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching whether retailers can entice shoppers to spend during what retailers consider the biggest shopping weekend of the year, especially after previously lackluster sales. A brightening economic outlook and ever-cheaper gas prices are starting to lift consumer confidence. But there are also signs of lingering wariness among consumers, after what has been an uneven economic recovery and anemic wage growth, especially for low-income households.\n\nOnline retailers are competing for an increasingly bigger share of the holiday spending. They are also driving many of the deals. Amazon has out-discounted many of the country's biggest retailers on big-ticket holiday items, offering a Samsung 55-inch 4K flat-screen television for $899. Dealnews.com, which closely tracks Black Friday deals, declared Amazon's deal \"without a doubt\" the cheapest name-brand 4K television it had ever seen.\n\nIBM Digital Analytics, which tracks online shopping transactions in the United States, said online sales rose 6.4 percent from the start of Thanksgiving through noon Eastern time on Black Friday. The value of an average order fell 1.8 percent from last year to $139.80, however, it said.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, an industry group, predicts that sales in November and December, excluding auto, gas and restaurant sales, will rise 4.1 percent from the same months last year, to $616.9 billion. That is a slightly faster clip compared with the 2013 holiday season, when sales grew 3.1 percent and made up roughly a fifth of the retail sector's annual sales of about $3.2 trillion.\n\nAnalysts said standouts included Old Navy, Kohl's and Macy's. Everyday discounters like TJ Maxx and Ross Stores had only light traffic, they said. Traffic was also weak at children's clothing stores, as shoppers appeared to be more focused on big-ticket items like TVs and laptops.\n\nHere are more scenes and themes from shoppers around the country:\n\nAt The Grove, a shopping center near Beverly Hills, Indira Reyna, 44, a Kmart customer service manager, said the shopping crowd this year was unremarkable. She has worked the day after Thanksgiving for most of her 13 years on the job.\n\n\"This year is really slow; there's a big difference from even last year,\" Reyna said. \"This is one of the first years that it's been like this. It's never been this slow. We still have all these deals.\"\n\nThis year, the Black Friday sales at Kmart began Thursday evening and the store stayed opened throughout the night.\n\n\"I'm shocked there are no crowds,\" said Lucia Rosenfeld, 60, who bought a cart full of toys for her grandchildren. \"I'm thinking, 'I'm not that early.' I'm actually underwhelmed.\"\n\nRosenfeld bought $113 worth of toys, including a Cars-themed children's chair from the Disney film she had come for in particular.\n\nSome pointed to the extended store hours for this year's sobering shopping experience; others noted a general aversion to Black Friday. For Jen Edwards, 44, a curator from New York City, this year's slow shopping day represented a combination of consumer trends and a nod to Los Angeles culture in general.\n\n\"I feel in L.A., nobody does anything before 11 a.m.,\" Edwards said. She had come to The Grove with her 5-year-old son dressed in a Santa Claus suit for his annual Christmas photos. \"We've been coming after Thanksgiving every year for four years because it's always dead.\"\n\nThese are long days for retail workers, but while some have objected to the encroachment of open stores on holidays like Thanksgiving, others have expressed a willingness to work to earn extra pay.\n\nLenwood Williams, head of security at the DC USA shopping center, arrived to ensure orderly lines. He shared a small Thanksgiving dinner with his fellow guards, all of them who had snacked throughout the day while on break.\n\nHe said was the first year the shopping center had provided a Thanksgiving meal for the 16 guards on duty. (Last year, stores did not open until 9 p.m., so there was no need for it.)\n\n\"I chose to be here on Thanksgiving to make sure things ran smoothly,\" he said.\n\nAt the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Apopka, Florida, an employee helped quell a disturbance among some shoppers waiting in line.\n\n\"They got a little antsy because it wasn't moving fast enough,\" said the employee, Nykee Harrell, 24, who was making $12 an hour for the shift, up from his usual $8. \"I had to step in and calm that situation. I'm the extra muscle.\"\n\nA few minutes later, a horde of customers raced to grab DVDs and CDs when store employees dropped a yellow tape - not unlike a crime-scene barrier - and allowed the throng to help themselves to the shelves in that section.\n\n\"Once you've got our item, please move back!\" an employee shouted into a megaphone.\n\n\"It's always a bit of a mess when they let them in,\" another worker, Tina Toole, said. \"They get crazy. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nBrandon Chapman, a 19-year-old senior at Apopka High School, was able to grab three DVDs for $4 each, and seemed pleased with the deal. But the crowd, he said, was a drawback.\n\n\"My advice is to get here early and wear body armor,\" he said.\n\nChris Garity, 43, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a county clerk and mother of three, hit five stores Thanksgiving evening, went home for a 3-hour nap, then rose at 4 a.m. to jump on her laptop and do some online shopping (Wal-Mart and Best Buy, the stores she didn't want to go to in person). She then napped again for a bit after setting her alarm again for a trip to Menards, arriving at 6:20 a.m. \"I'm tired,\" Garity said. \"My eyes burn. Do I need any of this? No! I could've stayed in bed. But this is fun. It's a high. I love a good deal. It's just my wiring.\"\n\nHer cart overflowed with storage bins, packs of batteries, three cellphone charging docks ($25 each), a one-pound Snickers bar for $8 (normally $10, she said), a car starter kit, even a tub of treats for her dogs.\n\nAs for shopping in stores versus online, Garity said she got an adrenaline rush from being inside a store. \"The online is a good thing, but it doesn't give you the experience. There's nobody to share it with. You push a button and it's done.\"\n\nRoughly 200 shoppers were lined up outside Fry's Electronics off Mopac Expressway in far north Austin, Texas, shortly before the electronics superstore's scheduled 5 a.m. Black Friday opening, many of them bundled up against brisk predawn temperatures in the mid-to-upper 40s.\n\nJohn Albert Juarez, 32, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, made a trip from his Central Texas hometown of Seguin, more than 75 miles from Austin, arriving in Austin about 6 p.m. Thanksgiving Day. His plan was to work through a list of 19 specific stores, with a budget of about $500, before returning to Seguin.\n\nHe was outside Fry's, his 13-year-old daughter and a cousin asleep in their car in the parking lot, when the line began shuffling inside the store at 5 a.m.\n\nAs he made the rounds in Fry's, he said, his scorecard of stores had \"10 down, nine to go.\" Juarez said he called up \"all the stores personally\" to find out opening and closing times for Thanksgiving and Black Friday.\n\nThe goal, he said, was to come away with \"just the things we need from day to day\" - like cologne, gloves and pajamas - at a discount of 50 percent. He said he also tried to negotiate further savings with clerks at the checkout counter. His daughter plays basketball and Juarez is a bicycling and exercise enthusiast, so sporting goods stores figured prominently on their shopping hit list.\n\nIn the early morning hours, parking lots in some suburbs were fairly empty even though stores were open for business.\n\nAt Lakeline Mall, in the town of Cedar Park in the fast-growing north Austin suburbs, about a dozen of the indoor mall's 150-plus stores stayed open from Thanksgiving evening into Black Friday.\n\nMacy's, among the larger stores open all night, was packed with hundreds of shoppers during the prime-time hours of 7 to 10 p.m. Thursday night. The crowds thinned out after midnight. By noon, the mall was once again teeming with customers, who filled the shopping center with an unbroken low-level roar.\n\nSheamus Healy, 46, a software engineer, said he was dragged along on Black Friday by his 13-year-old daughter Grace, who appealed to her dad to accompany her after a friend bailed out. He was in Macy's around 6 a.m. Friday, his arm draped with about a half-dozen men's shirts, as Grace, who will turn 14 on Saturday, shopped elsewhere in the store.\n\n\"I think I got suckered into it,\" Healy said good-naturedly. \"We'll go for breakfast after this. It'll be nice.\"\n\nWhile the enormous parking lot at the Garden State Mall in Paramus, New Jersey, was packed with cars Friday morning, many of the luxury stores inside were not overflowing with customers.\n\nGarden State, one of the largest malls in New Jersey, hosts a number of high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor, Gucci and Tiffany & Co. It opened at 7 a.m. on Black Friday, and by 8:30, the parking lots were packed.\n\nBut Neiman Marcus' high-end designer section was nearly empty. Only a handful of teenagers poked around inside the Gucci store, while the store clerks milled about with no serious shoppers to assist.\n\nDespite sales at Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger, few customers seemed interested in buying the famously tight designer bandage dresses. At Neiman, the sales were \"not as great as expected,\" said Jane Park, 33, of North Bergen Township. \"The stuff that was actually on sale wasn't actually stuff we could buy,\" she said. Too many were items meant for the summer, she said.\n\nPark had nearly the whole floor of luxury shops to herself, as crowds gathered at cheaper retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond and Victoria's Secret. Inside Neiman, more customers shopped one floor below, where cheaper (but still upscale) clothing lines like Helmut Lang are sold.\n\nWhile a few dozen shoppers looked around in Louis Vuitton by midmorning, most people still carried bags from Macy's, J.C. Penney, Victoria's Secret and other less expensive shops.\n\nPark, who works in commercial real estate, said that she planned to spend about $1,000 on holiday gifts, a bit more than she felt comfortable spending last year, but couldn't say precisely why.", "Chelsea are close to agreeing the second biggest Premier League shirt sponsorship ever with Turkish Airlines. A \u00a325million-a-year deal is expected to be finalised by Christmas.\n\nThe negotiations with the big spending airline, famous for its Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant TV adverts, were first revealed by Sports Agenda last September.\n\nThe money would be a significant advance on the \u00a318m-a-year Samsung currently pay to have their name on Chelsea shirts and would propel the club above Liverpool and Arsenal in the PL shirt sponsorship table.\n\nChelsea owner Roman Abramovich wants his club -- hot favourites to be crowned champions -- to be as dominant on football's commercial side as they are on the pitch.\n\nBut the west London club, already deep in talks with Turkish Airlines before former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow was brought in to revamp the commercial operation, still lag well behind Manchester United.\n\nThe Old Trafford shirt sponsorship with Chevrolet, that began this season, is worth \u00a353m annually.\n\nClare Balding could end up spending just 20 days a year presenting racing on Channel 4 when she finally agrees a new contract to accommodate her other broadcasting options.\n\nThat would mean Balding (right) hosting only the Derby, Grand National, Cheltenham and Royal Ascot.\n\nMeanwhile Lydia Hislop, Racing UK's combative presenter, who resigned from the Horserace Writers' Association after being criticised at an awards lunch, is on the broadcaster-of-year shortlist despite only HWA members being eligible.\n\nFIFA plan to end live video streaming of the post-executive committee meeting press conferences because of the pounding that president Sepp Blatter subsequently receives on social media.\n\nStrangely, online ridicule has not dissuaded Blatter from standing for a fifth term next May.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like the PR agency who get the job of helping FIFA in the build-up to Russia 2018 -- Webber Shandwick are favourites -- will face a tough task.\n\nThe video launching the tournament logo has already stirred up trouble by showing the disputed Crimean peninsula as part of Russia. FIFA were angry but the Kremlin were said to be very relaxed.\n\nlBBC Radio 5 Live, much to the angst of the England rugby team, will give commentary priority today to Manchester United v Hull City, a run-of-the-mill Premier League match.\n\nEngland's Test against Australia is relegated to 5 Live Sports Extra. However there have been assurances that Six Nations and Rugby World Cup games will be back on 5 Live.\n\nShaky start for Patel\n\nThe England Cricket Board's choice to succeed commercial director John Perera, who brought in $1billion worth of TV rights and sponsorships, has already ruffled a few feathers.\n\nSanjay Patel allegedly made an insensitive comment about committing suicide while on a panel at the Business of Cricket Awards. Patel was responding to a Somerset representative who admitted he was depressed about falling attendances and participation.\n\nThere were more than 200 people at the event, but an ECB spokesman claimed they heard nothing untoward.\n\nThe RFU offer to the International Rugby Board to win the right to host next year's World Cup included an \u00a380million guarantee and half of the 2.3m tickets being sold by the IRB to competing nations, sponsors and corporate hospitality.\n\nSo although ER (England Rugby) 2015 have only 140,000 of their allocation still to shift, tens of thousands of seats are likely to be returned by the IRB. That will leave ER 2015 to sell the returns at late notice -- some for supposedly sell-out matches.", "For the last few years, I have been recommending that users upgrade their systems with a solid state drive, or SSD. If you've for a system that's still chugging along with a hard disk drive at the heart of its storage subsystem, replacing it with a solid state drive will be one of, if not the most, effective upgrades possible. Most solid state drives can access and transfer data many times faster than any hard drive, and SSDs are more reliable, quieter, and they typically consume less power too. Of course, if the rest of the system features antiquated components, like a slow processor, or has a miniscule amount of RAM, a faster CPU or more memory would result in some significant performance gains. But, assuming you've already got a decent systems that's not starving for CPU or memory resources, an SSD upgrade will result in a perceptible performance boost -- the system will boot and shut down faster, applications with load quicker, and using the system will simply \"feel\" smoother.\n\nSamsung's Mainstream SSD 840 EVO Drives Are Fast And Affordable.\n\nTo date, the cost of solid state drive has been the single most used excuse for not purchasing one. Although prices have fallen significantly in recent years, good, high-performing solid state drives remain much more expensive -- in terms of cost per gigabyte -- then a hard drive. But today, prices came tumbling down to the lowest point ever. And I'm talking about slight discounts here, some high-performing drives from reputable manufacturers are currently available for a relative pittance. Here are a few of the best deals that I've stumbled across so far...\n\nThe prices on Samsung's mainstream 840 EVO series of drives were slashed across the whole line-up. If you don't need much capacity, the 120GB model is selling for only $65 at the moment. If you've got the coin though, the 500GB and 1TB drives can be bad for only $.37 or $.35, respectively. The 500GB drive is available for $189 (down from $269) and the 1TB drive is $349 (down from $499).\n\nThe SanDisk Extreme Pro Series Of Drives Offer An Industry Leading 10 Year Warranty.\n\nSanDisk has also slashed prices on some of its drives (and other solid state based storage devices) by up to 80%. The 240GB SanDisk Ultra II SSD is available at Amazon for only $85 currently. And SanDisk's Extreme Pro 240GB drive (which is one of the company's flagship products for the enthusiast market) can be had for $144. The Extreme Pro is one of the best performing, most consistent SSDs on the market, and it packs a 10 year warranty too.\n\nThere's lots of Black Friday noise out there today, and it's only going to get noisier as Cyber Monday approached, but I was surprised by the nosedive SSD prices took today and had to mention it. If you've got a system in need of a speed boost and have the funds available to pick up a drive with a suitable capacity, right now is the best time to do it.", "Kandace Dean of Aiken, S.C. looks a toy dinosaurs while shopping on Black Friday at Toys \"R\" Us in Augusta, Ga. on Friday, November 28, 2014. MIKE ADAMS/SPECIAL.\n\n\"People were all the way around the back to the dumpsters,\" Sharpton said. \"It was cold too.\"\n\nBack at his house, Sharpton used the time to do some online research, and when he returned to Best Buy on Black Friday morning, he was able to quickly locate the items he purchased: a Samsung 40-inch Smart TV and Yamaha surround sound system.\n\nSharpton said another plus of shopping Black Friday was avoiding the Thanksgiving crowds. He described the in-store traffic at Best Buy on Friday as \"any other regular day.\"\n\nNear Best Buy, several store parking lots within the Augusta Exchange shopping center remained half-full by mid-morning.\n\nBlack Friday, which for years has reigned the supreme shopping day of the holiday season, is now getting a chunk taken out by retailers choosing to open early on Thanksgiving. Kmart opened as early as 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving this year, while dozens of other national retailers welcomed customers in the early evening.\n\nIn the National Retail Federation's early predictions of the 2014 Thanksgiving shopping weekend, which runs from Thursday to Sunday, it expected 18.3 percent, or almost 26 million, of consumers would shop Thanksgiving. More than 68 percent, or 95.5 million, of shoppers were predicted to take advantage of Black Friday sales.\n\nLast year, the NRF said that 141 million shoppers spent $57 billion during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend. About 45 million consumers shopped on Thanksgiving, while another 92 million headed out to stores on Black Friday.\n\nBecause Thanksgiving shopping is still somewhat of a new phenomenon, Georgia Southern University Associate Economics Professor Tony Barilla said it's difficult to gauge what type of dent the Thursday sales will put on revenue generated during Black Friday.\n\n\"Businesses use hind site to judge consumer reactions,\" he said. \"If sale revenues continue to improve by having Thanksgiving shopping then they will provide Thanksgiving shopping.\"\n\nStill, Barilla does not see Black Friday in danger of falling off the top of the holiday shopping days.\n\n\"That is an established event with no potential holiday backlash,\" Barilla said. \"Most Americans have the day off, and are just coming out of their turkey coma so retailers will continue to attract people to a pure shopping event.\"\n\nNot one for Thanksgiving or Black Friday shopping, Jenni Richey loaded up on toys for her five young children at Toys \"R\" Us in Augusta in hopes that crowd sizes would be light Friday. She was in luck, as lines were short Friday morning at the national chain toy store off Wrightsboro Road.\n\n\"I figured all the crowds were gone since they opened so early (Thursday) that it would be pretty much just like shopping on a normal day, but with sales,\" she said. \"I think Thanksgiving should be closed still.\"\n\nFor Wadene Welch, also at Toys \"R\" Us, Black Friday shopping is a family tradition she started 25 years ago with her own children, now grown. On Friday, Welch was accompanied by her three daughters and a granddaughter.\n\n\"It's just the excitement of getting ready for the holidays and all the family getting together,\" she said.\n\nThe group of women had already stopped by stores in the Augusta Exchange and were headed next to the Augusta Mall and Surrey Center. They stood united in refusing to shop Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" said Welch, of the diminished Black Friday traffic. \"We used to fight for those cabbage patch dolls when these three were little.\"\n\nNext door, at the Augusta Mall, General Manager Andy Wilke said that about 100 retailers chose to open Thanksgiving night and the remaining 30 stores opened Friday morning.\n\nThe majority of those retailers open Thanksgiving beat last year's sales numbers, led by H&M, Michael Kors and Bath & Body Works, Wilke said.\n\nThe mall saw its highest shopper count on Thanksgiving between 8 and 10 p.m., Wilke said.\n\n\"People seemed to trickle in throughout the night rather than rush in the mall right at opening,\" he said.\n\nWilke said Black Friday traffic would likely peak at mid-day and hold steady into the night.\n\nThe mall had a traffic plan in place, which consisted of cones and barricades that directed vehicles in and out of the property. Richmond County sheriff's deputies also helped with traffic flow.\n\nAt Stein Mart on Washington Road, foot traffic was light but steady Friday morning. Store general manager Dona Montgomery expected a rush of customers to visit the store during afternoon hours.\n\nThis year, the retailer also opened on Thanksgiving for its first year.\n\n\"I think it's going to be really successful for the company overall,\" Montgomery said. \"We did have a good turnout (Thursday) night.\"", "Most people think of Black Friday and Cyber Weekend as opportunities to load up on holiday presents or finally snag the video games and high-tech gadgets they've been coveting all year.

But many customers are eschewing the best cameras and screens -- and their top-end price tags -- and choosing models that can get the job done at less than a third of the cost.\n\nSales of high-end Samsung and Apple phones remain robust, but demand for budget phones is growing. About a third of the smartphones sold in the U.S. between July and September cost less than $200, up from 18 percent a year ago, according to tech research firm IDC. A top-end phone costs $600 to $700 at full price, before the subsidies some phone companies offer in exchange for committing to two-year service contracts.\n\nNo longer are these cheap smartphones mostly no-frills devices with small screens and slow processors, says Ramon T. Llamas, a research manager for phones at IDC. As the costs of parts drop, phone manufacturers are able to outfit less-expensive models with advanced features once limited to high-end devices.\n\nThese phones lack the latest innovations, such as fingerprint security sensors and heart-rate monitors. They aren't as fast, and their cameras aren't as sharp. But the technology is more than adequate for those who just want to check email, look up sports scores and play video. Many cheaper phones now even offer the fastest wireless speeds on 4G LTE cellular networks, notes Jeff Bradley, senior vice president for devices at AT&T.\n\n\"There's a certain status to carrying an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, as an example, but there are also people who say, 'I want a good, reliable phone, but I'm not willing to spend as much money on that,\" says David Owens, a senior vice president at wireless carrier Sprint Corp.\n\nJoe Liggio, 16, a high school student in New York, says many of his friends have iPhones or Samsung phones, but he's never felt envy carrying his $180 Moto G from Motorola. He says it does everything he needs well, including texting, taking pictures, playing music and accessing the Internet.\n\nBesides the Moto G, Motorola has a $129 Moto E as an alternative to its $500 Moto X. Microsoft Corp.'s Lumia 635 costs $179 or less, compared with the $550 its flagship Lumia Icon retailed for at launch. The Nubia 5S Mini, ZTE Corp.'s most expensive phone, retails for $280 contract-free. ZTE has a few models for just $100.\n\nThe cheaper phone does mean smaller profit. According to IHS iSuppli, ZTE makes about $130 per Nubia device sold, compared with several hundred for Apple and Samsung devices before marketing and administrative costs. But targeting the budget crowd has made ZTE the No. 5 smartphone vendor in the U.S., according to IDC.\n\nWait, you say, $200 is \"cheap?\" Many consumers in the United States see a $200 price tag on a typical high-end phone and think that is what the phone costs. But the phone company actually subsidizes about $450 or so of the total cost and recovers that by charging higher service fees for voice, text and data over the life of a two-year contract. Some carriers are now pushing customers to pay a phone's full price in installments, such as AT&T's Next plan, but $27 a month over two years doesn't sound as bad as $650 all at once.\n\nSo who are the main buyers of these budget phones? The highest demand has been from those with prepaid wireless plans, which are popular among first-time smartphone buyers as well as customers who have poor credit and have to pay the full price of phones up front. But even that is changing.\n\nDoug Kaufman, Sprint's director of device strategy, says that 90 percent of phone sales with traditional contract plans had been for high-end devices, including year-old Apple and Samsung models. That's dipped to roughly 80 percent over the past half-year. Not everyone wants to pay $27 monthly when a lower-end phone can be had for less than $10 a month. And with the rise of family plans, parents are getting cheaper phones for their kids while choosing the latest and the greatest for themselves, he says.\n\nMichael Weaver, an executive at the mobile-messaging firm Waterfall in New York, bought a Motorola Droid Mini for $50 with a contract, compared with $200 upfront for a high-end phone. Others \"feel like they need to buy (something) that can launch the space shuttle, but they don't use half the features,\" he says.", "Today is Black Friday, following Thanksgiving Day in the US, and it is the day of shopaholics.

The headlines stream can continue to run even if the main screen is turned off or in standby mode.\n\nWhen a user sees a headline that piques his interest, he can simply tap on it to automatically launch the full news story on the main screen.\n\nST editor Warren Fernandez said: \"We are always looking for new ways to engage our readers and ensure they have timely news content regardless of how they choose to view it - from print to online to mobile.\n\n\"This new, customised ST app uses the unique second screen feature in the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge to help our readers keep abreast of the news even as they enjoy their favourite activities on their phones.\"\n\nThe ST app can be customised in many ways. When a user taps on a headline, it can be customised to link to the Web or the app version of the corresponding ST article.\n\nUsers can also select their favourite news categories to be shown on the ticker tape, such as Top Stories, Latest, Most Read, Singapore, Asia, World, Business, Sport, Tech and Lifestyle. The ST news headlines can also be set to refresh at intervals of 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes.\n\nThe new Straits Times app will be preloaded on all Samsung Galaxy Note Edge phones sold in Singapore starting today. Consumers who bought the Edge earlier can download the app free from Samsung's Galaxy Apps store.\n\nThe app was developed in close consultation with Samsung to ensure a good user experience for ST readers.\n\nMr Eugene Goh, vice-president for IT and mobile at Samsung Electronics Singapore, said: \"We are proud of our collaboration with The Straits Times on this Note Edge-optimised app, which elevates the consumer experience and ensures that consumers can keep up to date with what's happening in the world.\"", "A new year is fast approaching, and that means a whole new round of flagship devices from manufacturers is coming too.\n\nSamsung, for instance, is likely readying the Galaxy S6 as you read this, and the speculation is mounting about what it may or may not feature. Will it have a 5.2-inch, flexible display with 4K resolution? Or maybe even an all-metal frame?\n\nKeep reading to catch up on all the latest rumours (including what we really want it to feature).\n\nSamsung hasn't officially announced the Galaxy S6, obviously, nor when it will release.\n\nThe company does follow a pattern however - or rather an annual product cycle. Since the Galaxy S2, it has debuted phones sometime around Mobile World Congress. That means the Galaxy S6 should show up at a press conference probably before the trade show starts.\n\nPrice\n\nAs for when the phone will actually launch, the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5 both launched in April 2013 and April 2014, respectively, so the Galaxy S6 should go on sale in April 2015. And it will likely be price similarly to the Galaxy S5, which had a price tag of \u00a3579 without a SIM.\n\nIf the phone happens to blow our minds and be more premium, expect a price tag north of \u00a3600.\n\nThe latest chatter has indicated the Galaxy S6 could feature a flexible display.\n\nAt a recent event for Samsung investors, Lee-Chang Hoon, vice president of Samsung Display's business, said: \"We plan to provide consumers with a product that has a flexible display by the end of the year.\"\n\nFrame\n\nRumours have long suggested the Galaxy S6 will feature a plastic OLED tha would allow the device to fold and bend, though it's also widely believed, especially since the all-metal Galaxy Alpha debuted, that the Galaxy S6 will feature a metal frame.\n\nWhile it's not yet confirmed if the Galaxy S6 will feature any of these changes, keep in mind Samsung might have something radical up its sleeve. That's right. At long last it looks like a smartphone revolution could be on its way in Samsung's Project Zero.\n\nProject Zero\n\nProject Zero is Samsung's next major project. More specifically, it's a codename project for the the Galaxy S6, according to sources of Sam Mobile. Previous phones from Samsung have also sported Project monikers, including Project K for the S5 and Project T for the Note 4.\n\nIt's thought that by changing the letters to numbers and by starting at zero, Samsung has a significant shift in the works. Perhaps, finally, Samsung is going back to the drawing board to create a handset that reflects the wealth of the company.\n\nDue to critics and consumers alike voicing criticism about the design choices made in its latest flagship smartphone - coupled with less-than-expected Galaxy S5 sales - Samsung recently replaced its mobile design leader Chang Dong-hoon with deputy Lee Min-hyouk.\n\nIt's therefore safe to assume the Galaxy S6 will feature a dramatically different design than past flagship devices, though whether the new design might include a flexible display and/or metal frame has yet to be confirmed by the company.\n\nSamsung of course has its own Tizen operating system, but the Galaxy S6 will probably stick to Android. More specifically, the Galaxy S6 will probably have Android Lollipop since the OS will have been around for months by the time it releases.\n\nIt'll also likely run Samsung's TouchWiz UI as an overlay rather than pure Android.\n\nScreen\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S lineup has grown from 4-inches to 5.1-inches within five generations, so the Galaxy S6 might go up to 5.2- or 5.3-inches. The Galaxy S5 also had a rather thick bezel, so Samsung could conceivably fit a larger display in the same-sized frame.\n\nKeep in mind that Samsung won't go too huge with the screen, because then it will be going into Galaxy Note territory, and it most likely wants to continue differentiating the two lines. Samsung has also previously said it will have 4K 3840 x 2160 displays on the market by 2015.\n\nIt's therefore possible that the Galaxy S6 will bypass 2K and feature a 4K screen. That said, South Korean news outlet Daum has predicted it'll have a curved screen with a Quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.\n\nCamera\n\nThe most recent reports have all pined for the Galaxy S6 to include a 20MP camera, but there has been no rumours or word just yet. We'd certainly like Samsung to improve upon the Galaxy S5's 16MP front-facing shooter.\n\nQualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 808 and Snapdragon 810 CPUs in April, and they're expected to appear in handsets sometime in early 2015. That's the same time we expect the Galaxy S6 to release.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 features a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 chipset, and the Galaxy S4 featured a Snapdragon 600 chipset, so it makes sense that Samsung would put either the 808 or 810 units in the Galaxy S6. We'd prefer the 64-bit, six-core Snapdragon 808 processor.\n\nThe 808 can support display resolutions up to 2560 x 1600 pixels, and it's supposed to come with LPDDR3 memory, battery management improvements, and Adreno 418 GPU for impressive graphics performances.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 will likely include Samsung's fingerprint scanner, as well as the heart rate monitor and microSD card slot from the Galaxy S5, and water and dust resistancy, etc. All that aside, there are some new things we're really hoping to see (apart from the stuff mentioned above).\n\nExamples include a big battery, faster wireless charging, stock Android, more than one speaker, and Moto X-style always listening functionality, among other things. Let us know in the comments if you can think of anything else you'd like to see included in the Galaxy S6.", "ENLARGE Tomasz Walenta By Erik Sofge Nov. 28, 2014 12:19 p.m. ET\n\nANYONE SHOPPING for a new television -- whether this Cyber Monday or beyond -- will no doubt be steered toward the latest Ultra HD models (also known as 4K), whose image resolution is quadruple that of standard high-definition sets.\n\nBut even though these new sets are dazzling to behold, it's important to remember that a television's beauty is more than screen deep. Yes, you should consider picture quality and similar specs, but in the vast sea of nearly identical-looking models, there are plenty of other, sometimes overlooked, criteria to consider.\n\nMovie buffs, for example, might want to splurge on a model with room-filling audio, while casual gamers might appreciate the ability to stream games directly from the Internet to a set. For those early adopters who do decide to jump on the Ultra HD bandwagon, an easy-to-upgrade model that aims to protect their investment in this still nascent technology is definitely worth considering. And, of course, finding the perfect balance of price and performance is a good way to pick a TV, too.\n\nWe're not suggesting, of course, that all televisions that tout clever features are worth a place in your living room. (When 3-D was first introduced, for example, the dubious but heavily promoted feature cost extra.) But TVs are more varied and unique than shoppers might realize. These four models are worth adding to your short list.\n\nFor Early Adopters | Samsung HU9000 65-inch 4K TV\n\nUndoubtedly, super-sharp TVs known as Ultra HD (or \"4K\") are the future. But that future is still a ways off. Sure, Netflix may have launched its 4K-streaming service this year, but few TV shows or movies are available to watch in 4K on Netflix or anywhere else. More worrying, the protocols for the format haven't been fully established -- which means that some current Ultra HD TVs might not be compatible with the 4K content to come.\n\nThat's what makes Samsung models that work with the One Connect Box (also from Samsung) so compelling. These sets, like the 65-incher in the HU9000 series, offload much of the image processing to an external box that can be upgraded down the line, most likely for a fraction of the TV's original cost. Beyond allowing you to boost performance with up-to-date processors, this feature should guarantee that the TV can accommodate the latest 4K content. In the meantime, standard HD video will still look stunning on this model's glare-reducing curved screen. $3,500, samsung.com\n\nFor the Price-Conscious | Vizio E-Series 60-inch LED HDTV ENLARGE Tomasz Walenta\n\nIf you're just looking to get the most for your money, the typical TV showroom can be a confusing place. Are those Cyber Monday bargains or the floor models at a rock-bottom price really a good deal? And what about the slew of affordable sets from B-list or house brands, such as RCA, Dynex, Insignia and Magnavox?\n\nSavvy bargain hunters will want to avoid all of the above and check out Vizio's E-Series LED models instead. This line is aggressively priced and notable for a feature called \"full-array local dimming.\" Instead of adjusting the image uniformly to improve contrast -- for example, by darkening the picture to create deeper blacks during a nighttime scene or brightening the picture to make a blue sky pop more -- the set will dim or lighten parts of the screen independently. That means a character's flashlight will be made lighter without washing out the shadows around it to a muddy gray. Although sets range from 23 to 70 inches, the 60-incher hits a sweet spot of price and screen size. $800, vizio.com\n\nFor Stellar Sound | Bang & Olufsen BeoVision Avant 55-inch 4K TV ENLARGE Tomasz Walenta\n\nIf money is no object, finding a TV with breathtaking picture quality is pretty easy. Obtaining breathtaking audio, on the other hand, is more of a challenge -- especially if you don't want to clutter your space with speakers.\n\nBang & Olufsen's immodestly priced BeoVision Avant is among the most discreet solutions. At the push of a button, its built-in 3.1-channel soundbar slides under its 55-inch screen. Far from a tacked-on gimmick, the integrated speakers (including two surprisingly forceful subwoofers) deliver blistering, room-filling sound. (Bang & Olufsen is first and foremost a maker of luxury audio products, after all.)\n\nFor true surround sound, home-theater purists will want to add at least two more speakers at the rear of the room. But the Avant makes that largely hassle-free, too. It can sync with up to eight wireless speakers that are WiSA-certified, whether from Bang & Olufsen or other manufacturers. $7,995 without stand, bang-olufsen.com\n\nFor Casual Gamers | Sony W800B 50-inch LED HDTV ENLARGE Tomasz Walenta\n\nAmong the many 1080p LED televisions on the market in the $1,000-or-so price range, this model might seem fairly standard. Yes, its colors are accurate, and it can access streaming-video services, such as Netflix and Hulu, directly over Wi-Fi -- but so can many other TVs.\n\nSo what differentiates the 50-inch W800B? Its ability to stream PlayStation 3 games without a gaming console. This set (along with others of varying sizes from Sony) can tap into the PlayStation Now service, which lets you stream PS3 titles over the Internet for a modest rental fee. Although the selection is limited and games can stutter if you don't have a fast Internet connection, the service (still in beta) has plenty of must-try games, among them the expressionistic, genre-bending \"Proteus\" ($4 for a 7-day rental). For ex-gamers looking for an occasional fix or anyone who is curious about the state of gaming but not ready to buy a console, this set is a low-commitment solution. $1,000, plus $55 for a wireless game controller, store.sony.com\n\nMore Gear & Gadgets The Best Headphones You Can Customize With an App Which Streaming Media Stick Should I Buy?

That seems to show that lower gas prices and an improving job picture are making shoppers more confident about opening their wallets.\n\nBridget McNabb of Kansas City, Kansas, stopped at a mostly empty suburban Target around 5:30 a.m. Friday after a solid day of holiday cooking.

But first, the 55-year-old -- who said she was ''old enough to know better'' than to be out so early -- stopped at the electronics department.\n\nShe was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV her husband wanted had sold out the night before.\n\n''I'll pop online later,'' she said.\n\nAt a Wal-Mart store near Cincinnati, Vicki Stuhlreyer of West Chester Township was on an all-night shopping marathon with her two children Brad and Madi.\n\nThey had been to several stores and malls in search of bargains, and found at the Wal-Mart what Brad wanted for his apartment -- a 55-inch TV, a Samsung on sale for $548, 30 percent off.\n\n''It was worth it,'' he said of the hours of bargain-hunting. They had breakfast at a nearby Waffle House while waiting for the 6 a.m. TV sale.\n\nMadi was still on a quest for bargains, such as for a new comforter, but hadn't been able to snag what she was looking for.\n\nThey planned to take Brad and his TV home, then decide where else to hit.\n\n''I'm more of endurance shopper,'' said Madi, a junior bio premed student. ''I'd like to go back out again.''\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora Illinois, the mood was calm Friday morning. Parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or nonexistent. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, who was shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly more quiet around 6:30 a.m. Friday than it was the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall to pick up some holiday deals.\n\n''It was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,'' States said. ''Now it seems like more of the old folks.''\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it's still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.\n\nIn a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed on Friday.\n\nWith stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAnd shoppers certainly were out in full force on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And 2,000 rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m. For Macy's 6 p.m. opening, there were more than 15,000 shoppers outside its New York flagship store, a little more than last year.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target's CEO in August and was at the East Harlem store on Thanksgiving, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n''It's been more of a week event,'' he told The Associated Press. After luring shoppers with big discounts on TVs, Razor scooters and other items, Target is hoping to bring them back Friday with a 10 percent discount on gift cards, the first time it has cut gift card prices.\n\nCornell said he was encouraged that shoppers were buying extra items like clothing and home furnishings.\n\n''The baskets are full,'' he added.\n\nHank Mullany, President of Toys R Us' U.S. business, also noted that shoppers were buying more than just the deep discounts.\n\nHe noted that he was pleased with traffic Thanksgiving and the second wave of customers Friday for another set of deals.\n\n''It's more of a steady stream today,'' he added.\n\n__\n\nAP Writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Kansas, Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, and Sara Burnett in Aurora, Illinois, contributed to this report.", "While most of the TV and HDTV deals you'll see this Black Friday and Cyber Monday are on LED/LCD TVs, there are still a few plasma TVs being offered.

We predict that this will be one of the last great deals on a large high performance plasma HDTV .\n\nHere's the link:\n\nThe 60-inch F5300 (full model number PN60F5300AFXZA) is a full HD 1080p panel with a 600 Hz sub-field drive for excellent motion reproduction (great for movies and sports). The smaller 51-inch F5300 set was one of Geoff Morrison's picks for best $500 TV last year over at the WireCutter.\n\nThe PN60F5300 includes an on-board HD tuner for local HD broadcasts, but does not include any Smart TV streaming features. We'd recommend pairing it with a Roku, Apple TV, streaming Blu-ray Player, gaming system or Google ChromeCast if you want to add streaming capabilities.\n\nPrice is current and the TV is in stock at the time of posting now but Best Buy may adjust pricing at any time. Also, stock may not last at this price.", "It's a 10-part TV documentary series, an interactive Web doc, an online magazine and a virtual-reality experiment.\n\nThe producers behind The Polar Sea, which follows a trio of middle-aged amateur sailors on an ambitious and arduous voyage through the Northwest Passage, don't really care how people experience their investigation into climate change in the Arctic. But they are proud that the main attraction, the television documentary, is getting so much airtime.\n\nThe Polar Sea is being broadcast on TVO in Ontario starting on Monday. New episodes will air every weeknight over the course of two weeks. The Canada-German co-production involved five film crews working over the course of four months.\n\nProducer Kevin McMahon, of Toronto-based Primitive Entertainment, said the idea was to look at climate change through the Arctic because it is changing faster than anywhere else in the world.\n\n\"Ten or 15 years ago it would've been impossible for me or you to sail through the Northwest Passage, but if you're an amateur sailor, now that's your goal. In a way it's become like the new Mount Everest, something people want to test themselves against,\" McMahon said.\n\nThe documentary series will also be available for streaming at tvo.org/polarsea. Borrowing a strategy from Netflix, all 10 episodes will go online on Monday for binge watchers to gorge on.\n\nIt was decided early on that the TV documentary would be just one part of the The Polar Sea story, McMahon said, adding: \"We're trying to offer as many doors into the story as we possibly can.\"\n\nDigital production company Deep 360 created an interactive 30-minute online companion documentary with a technology called 360-degree video. In a Web browser, users can zoom, pan up or down, or spin the camera angle around as the documentary plays.\n\n\"Everyone had this wish to create something on the interactive side in tandem with the series that would allow people to actually experience the Arctic,\" said Deep 360 founder Thomas Wallner.\n\n\"We never use the words 'climate change' in the story ever. It's about experiencing the Arctic and experiencing the changes through people's eyes, it's not about hitting people over the head with a heavy-handed message,\" he added.\n\nThe interactive documentary is also compatible with soon-to-be-released virtual reality devices, including the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift and Samsung's Gear VR. Early adopters of virtual reality will be eager to get their hands on content for those devices, which should expose The Polar Sea to new audiences worldwide.\n\n\"There may be an audience coming into this that doesn't necessarily care about climate change or the Arctic, but they'll be brought into it [by the technology],\" said Wallner.\n\nFor those who want to go more deeply into the subject matter, there's an interactive online magazine based on the TV documentary.\n\nMcMahon said those who take in The Polar Sea - in any of its forms - may be surprised by how much debate there is about the future of the Arctic.\n\n\"Whatever will happen in the Arctic - whether global warming continues to undermine the subsistence culture, or whether it gives them opportunities to transform into a more industrial culture with more mining and oil wells and so on - all of that is going to be decided by people who live in the Arctic, or at least they're going to have a voice in it.\"The Canadian Press", "November has seen some really important reviews hit Android Central, including reviews of the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Samsung Gear S ... along with an in-depth Review of Android 5.0 Lollipop too!

It's worth a look.", "Qualcomm already rules the mobile world -- now it wants to tackle all of the other gadgets in your life. But none of this should be a surprise if you've been paying attention. Its Snapdragon chips already power most high-end smartphones, so it makes sense for Qualcomm to leverage that experience into chips for wearables, cars, home appliances and more. The company is even eyeing the server market, a move that should have Intel shaking in its hermetically sealed bunny boots.\n\nIt's all a big change for Qualcomm, which started out as more of a background player until it realized it could do a lot more than just power your wireless connection. After beating out Texas Instruments as the world's leading mobile chipset provider in 2007 (according to iSuppli), Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon system-on-a-chip. That wrapped together hardware components like a CPU, GPU and wireless connectivity into a tidy package, making it easier for device makers to drop it into their designs. Its unveiling couldn't be timed any better, as that was also the year Apple unveiled the iPhone and gave the mobile industry a swift kick in the pants. With Snapdragon, Qualcomm ended up having the right solution at just the right time as everyone scrambled to compete with Apple.\n\n\"What we're finding in addition to the [smartphone] market, we're now interested in growing outside the core business into what we call adjacent markets,\" Raj Talluri, Qualcomm's SVP of product, told us. That's a fairly subdued way of framing Qualcomm's journey into entirely new areas, which includes wearables, cars and virtual reality, all of which are looking more like the smartphone market every day. It's not just hubris leading Qualcomm into invading more devices; it's a logical step forward, according to Talluri. \"When we get into new markets, we look at ones that are growing, exciting, with a level of innovation that we can deliver ... That's really at the heart of [what] Qualcomm is really about.\"\n\nQualcomm's Toq smartwatch (above) serves as an example of what's possible with the company's existing technology. Like most health trackers, it can track your steps and other activity. But it's also one of the few devices to include the company's Mirasol display, which gives it an always-on color screen that can last for several days. And it's equipped with Qualcomm's wireless-charging capability, which is slowly making its way to other devices. Samsung, LG and ASUS are already using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 in their Android Wear smartwatches, and others are likely to follow. But Qualcomm doesn't yet have anything developed specifically for wearables -- gadget makers are just plugging in the same chip that phones are using.\n\nEven Qualcomm admits it doesn't have much of a plan for wearables yet. \"Right now, we [the tech world] are experimenting with a bunch of concepts [around wearables],\" Qualcomm EVP Cristiano Amon told us. \"We need all of that experimentation to somewhat settle out, then we'll probably think about doing something more specific.\" That wait-and-see approach makes sense. It's tough to figure out how to tackle a new market until there's a clearer sense of what it would look like. But the company also needs to be prepared to jump into new opportunities quickly. Complacency is dangerous. Just ask Intel, which missed out on the mobile chip market entirely and is still trying to find its way in.\n\nBut if you want to get a sense of how Qualcomm will approach wearables, you just need to look at the technology it's developed so far, Talluri says. Its innovations around making phones more power-efficient could eventually help smartwatches last more than just a few hours. And you'll also be able to do a lot more with a smartwatch once it has a cellular modem of its own, rather than being tethered to your smartphone.\n\nThe company is also taking a similar approach to cars (above), a market it's quite familiar with. Its chips already get cars connected to services like OnStar, but now Qualcomm is looking to modernize dashboards and backseat entertainment systems. We're used to touchscreens, apps and seamless connectivity on our phones, so why not our cars? And if the whole self-driving thing actually takes off, we could end up relying on cars in entirely different ways in the future. Qualcomm hasn't announced any partners for its smart-car initiative yet, but Talluri noted that this is one market where progress will be a bit slower. The design cycle for cars typically takes several years, a glacial pace compared to the annual upgrades we see in the gadget world. That's something that could change soon, though, now that carmakers are eager to take advantage of smart-car platforms like Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay.\n\nQualcomm's also played a role in shaping the modern virtual reality renaissance by working with both Oculus VR and Samsung. For the Gear VR, which is powered by a Snapdragon-equipped Galaxy Note 4, it helped Samsung achieve a smooth frame rate of 60 FPS and balance power efficiency, Talluri noted. He also pointed out that VR could also end up being one of the first real justifications for throwing 4K displays into phones. You probably won't be able to tell the difference between a 1080p and 4K phone screen through normal usage, but press that screen up against your eyeballs in a VR headset and all of a sudden those extra pixels don't seem so superfluous after all.\n\nAnd while Qualcomm's foray into server chips won't affect consumers directly, it's still a huge move. For the first time, Qualcomm is entering a market that Intel already dominates. And it'll be a huge boon to server admins eagerly awaiting ARM-based servers, which offer power efficiency over raw computing muscle. That could lead to things like cloud storage prices dropping even further as it becomes cheaper for companies to operate those servers.\n\nBut as it eyes new territory, Qualcomm isn't ignoring the products and markets it's already known for. It's going to continue pushing LTE chipsets as emerging markets, especially China, upgrade from 3G (and, in some cases, even 2G) networks. It's also seeing huge adoption in China for all of its mobile chips, from the low-end to the high-end for upstart manufacturers like Xiaomi. And, of course, it has huge upgrades in the works for the Snapdragon line. (No, I couldn't get any specifics, but one exec mentioned the new chips would sport some \"very disruptive\" features. Your guess is as good as mine.)\n\nAs successful as it has been, it's worth noting Qualcomm didn't even know that its full-throated support for the smartphone market would pay off. \"We weren't sure it was going to be good for the company,\" CEO Steven Mollenkopf said last month at a CommNexus event (check out the full session below). \"Sometimes you have to make bets against yourself to be successful.\" And now, as it eyes the nascent world of wearables and the connectivity of everything, we're seeing the company make similar bets. They won't all pay off -- but if Qualcomm manages to play an essential role in just a few new successful markets, it won't be long until it's truly everywhere.", "Summary: Lenovo is on Samsung's footsteps to promote its products. Recently, a promotional video has been aired to promote the sales of Yoga 3 Pro, while aiming the MacBook Air.\n\nLenovo has become one of Apple's biggest challengers in the personal computer landscape. That being said, a few months ago Lenovo made news when they teamed up with Microsoft to make a video that would take a shot at Apple for their one-dimensional laptops. Once again, Lenovo was at it again this week on the heels of the launch and release of their latest laptop the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro.\n\nIn the video while demonstrating how the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro bends both ways, and can hold many different positions, and essentially function as a tablet - as well as a full-blown laptop - the demonstrator breaks an Apple MacBook Air, while attempting to show the same functionality. Cue up a fleeing associate, who isn't actually an associate at all at the display, the entrance of the \"real employee\" as well as a security guard to really drive home the fear that the unsuspecting bystanders are undoubtedly feeling, and just over two-minutes later - the big reveal happens when they find out they're a part of Lenovo's next advertising campaign.\n\nSamsung is already famous for such cheap promotions. In spite of such promotions, everyone knows what happened with their Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5. Now, Lenovo is on footsteps of Samsung.\n\nWhat's in the computer though? The Yoga 3 Pro is powered by an Intel Core M-5Y70 CPU with a 1.1 GHz processor. Add in an impressive 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of hard drive space and what you're left with is an impressive 2-in-1 when you consider the fact that it is both a laptop and a tablet. If that's not enough, the Yoga Pro 3 also brings a 13.3-inch display, which is an equivalent to the Yoga Pro 2. Perhaps the most impressive physical feature of the device isn't the screen or flexibility, but rather the Intel integrated HD 5300 card that gives the device some serious power when it comes to gaming.\n\nSee Also: LG G3 32GB Smartphone with AT&T/Sprint contract for $0.01 + free shipping\n\nThe Yoga 3 Pro won't falter under extreme use either, with the flexibility that the device has. It has a single-metal band design that basically acts like a strengthened metal watchband. The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro is relatively expensive though compared to other similar devices. It's even more expensive than the MacBook Air, which for an Apple product to win in the price category - really says something - when the company really doesn't dabble in the low-end of anything in the tech space.\n\nSee Also: HTC One M8 for $0.01 with 2-Year Contract at Verizon, AT&T, Sprint + free shipping\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro starts at $1,299 compared to the MacBook Air, which starts well-below the $1,000-mark. All-in-all this is a device that if you're looking for functionality beyond a laptop, or something that can work as a tablet while you're on the run - then this would be a better investment. But, if you're looking for a laptop that focuses on functionality - then this is likely not the device for you.\n\n[Source]", "If you tried to score some Black Friday deals on Best Buy this morning and found the site down, don't blame your Internet carrier. A surge in traffic overwhelmed the site, causing an outage that forced the retailer to take bestbuy.com down for about 90 minutes. By 10:30 a.m. CST, the site was back online and open for business.\n\nBest Buy released a statement saying that \"a concentrated spike in mobile traffic triggered issues that led us to shut down BestBuy.com in order to take proactive measures to restore full performance.\" Mobile shopping is up 20% from last year and it looks like Best Buy just wasn't ready for the jump in traffic.\n\nThis is just another sign that more customers are choosing to avoid the crowds by shopping online for Black Friday. Rival Target has reported a 40% hike in online sales over the same period in 2013. Last year's Black Friday was the chain's biggest day ever in online sales but today could top that record.\n\nAccording to Target spokesperson Eddie Baeb, about half of those Target shoppers are using mobile devices like phones and tablets. This is no doubt partially due to Target's streamlined and info-filled mobile app which is light years ahead of the competition and makes it easy to shop wherever you may be, even standing in line at a rival store.\n\nWhile online shoppers love the ease, convenience and speed of buying stuff without leaving home, others miss the whole Black Friday experience of communing with fellow shoppers over doorbuster specials. OTOH, many shoppers are relieved to avoid the traffic, the cold weather and most of all, the other shoppers.\n\nTV station KPRC in Stafford, Texas, recorded a brawl in a Houston area Walmart with crowds of Black Friday shoppers fighting each over discounted Samsung TV sets while security guards desperately tried to restore order. Aren't you sorry that you're missing all that fun?", "NEW YORK -- Stores are welcoming a second wave of shoppers in what has become a two-day kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\n\nThe big question: How much the Thanksgiving shopping will hurt Black Friday, which is relinquishing its status as the frenzied start of the holiday shopping season?\n\nThe crowds were thin early Friday morning in parts of the country, but traffic is expected to pick up throughout the day.\n\nOne positive sign: Toys R Us and Target executives told The Associated Press shoppers seem to be buying more than just the doorbusters and filling their carts with other items not on sale. That seems to show that lower gas prices and an improving job picture are making shoppers more confident about opening their wallets.\n\nBridget McNabb of Kansas City, Kansas, stopped at a mostly empty suburban Target around 5:30 a.m. Friday after a solid day of holiday cooking. \"I started the dishwasher and came in,\" she said.\n\nHer goal was a coffee pot for her niece. But first, the 55-year-old -- who said she was \"old enough to know better\" than to be out so early -- stopped at the electronics department.\n\nShe was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV her husband wanted had sold out the night before.\n\n\"I'll pop online later,\" she said.\n\nAt a Wal-Mart store near Cincinnati, Vicki Stuhlreyer of West Chester Township was on an all-night shopping marathon with her two children Brad and Madi.\n\nThey had been to several stores and malls in search of bargains, and found at the Wal-Mart what Brad wanted for his apartment -- a 55-inch TV, a Samsung on sale for $548, 30 percent off.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" he said of the hours of bargain-hunting. They had breakfast at a nearby Waffle House while waiting for the 6 a.m. TV sale.\n\nMadi was still on a quest for bargains, such as for a new comforter, but hadn't been able to snag what she was looking for.\n\nThey planned to take Brad and his TV home, then decide where else to hit.\n\n\"I'm more of endurance shopper,\" said Madi, a junior bio premed student. \"I'd like to go back out again.\"\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora Illinois, the mood was calm Friday morning. Parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or nonexistent. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, who was shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly more quiet around 6:30 a.m. Friday than it was the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall to pick up some holiday deals.\n\n\"It was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,\" States said. \"Now it seems like more of the old folks.\"\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it's still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.\n\nIn a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed on Friday.\n\nWith stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAnd shoppers certainly were out in full force on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And 2,000 rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m. For Macy's 6 p.m. opening, there were more than 15,000 shoppers outside its New York flagship store, a little more than last year.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target's CEO in August and was at the East Harlem store on Thanksgiving, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n\"It's been more of a week event,\" he told The Associated Press. After luring shoppers with big discounts on TVs, Razor scooters and other items, Target is hoping to bring them back Friday with a 10 percent discount on gift cards, the first time it has cut gift card prices.\n\nCornell said he was encouraged that shoppers were buying extra items like clothing and home furnishings.\n\n\"The baskets are full,\" he added.\n\nHank Mullany, President of Toys R Us' U.S. business, also noted that shoppers were buying more than just the deep discounts.\n\nHe noted that he was pleased with traffic Thanksgiving and the second wave of customers Friday for another set of deals.\n\nAP Writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Kansas, Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, and Sara Burnett in Aurora, Illinois, contributed to this report.", "A new Samsung smartphone recently made its way through the FCC with a model number of SM-A700FD. Rumored to be called the Galaxy A7, this unannounced handset is believed to be part of the Korean electronics manufacturer's A series. The phone's FCC documents don't give up a large amount of information, however they confirm support for LTE and NFC connectivity.\n\nAs for the Galaxy A7's specs, the device will reportedly feature a 5.2-inch 1080p display, a 64-bit Snapdragon 615 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter. A thumbs up from the FCC doesn't necessarily guarantee an immediate product launch, however it does confirm that something (most likely the Galaxy A7) is in the works.", "Black Friday 2014 live: Deals that you can grab now.

Best Buy is also giving $199.99 Panasonic 50-inch LED HDTV besides Blu-ray discs for just $9.99 including \"Maleficent\" and \"How to Train Your Dragon 2.\" It is needless to say that it is steal.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe king of the retailers with largest number of stores is going to give you a large number of options today on top of the line smartphones. The best offer may not be coming from Walmart, but its offers are significant. One great offer on the most sought after handset this year namely iPhone 6 is coming from Walmart. Walmart is offering you the 16GB iPhone 6 for $179 (with contract) along with a $75 gift card. This means that you get $100 off on a handset that is still selling like hotcake in the market. Walmart is also offering the last iteration of iPhone namely iPhone 5S at $79 (with contract) along with $75 Walmart gift card. This means that you will get hold of the handset at almost free for as little as $3.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon has a large numer of amazing offers reserved for Black Friday 2014.

Back in October 2014, we pieced together what we thought would be the ideal top 10 Games that need to hit PlayStation Plus... it seems as though the team at Sony PlayStation has answered our call, for at least one title anyway. Read More.\n\nPlayStation Plus Free Game Lineup November 2014\n\nThe October lineup was quite honestly a great one. Not only did we receive titles like of Dust: An Elysian Tail, but we also received, Spelunky, Batman Arkham Asylum, Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara, and a host of other great titles. The PlayStation Plus Free Game Lineup November 2014 looks to deliver some great content as well. Read More.", "The Wall Street Journal has reported that Sony is behind the innovative e-paper FES Watch (Image: Masayuki Hayashi)\n\nLast week saw an electronic paper-toting wearable, known as the FES Watch, return to Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake. Having already succeeded in a previous funding effort back in September, the renewed project is being pitched as a second chance for those who missed out first time around to get their hands on the product. While the campaign is well on the way towards its funding goal under its own steam, a Sony spokesman has revealed to the Wall Street Journal that the product is actually an undercover effort from the Japanese electronics giant.\n\nEven without the news that Sony is behind it, the FES Watch is an interesting enough device in its own right. There are no smartwatch features on board (so no push notifications, voice search, etc.), with the wearable being pitched as a fashion accessory first and foremost.\n\nThe watch not only makes use of electronic paper on its dial, but also on its integrated strap. It ships with 24 designs which you can switch between by pressing the physical button on the side of the device. There's a motion sensor included, with the face turning on when the user raises it to check the time - a feature we're used to on Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.\n\nOne of the biggest draws of e-paper displays is their long running times, with the team promising 60-day battery life from the device. While the current version doesn't offer any functionality over an analog watch, it's likely more of a prototype of what might be possible in future watches that could bring smart functionality with them. The fact that the display extends to the strap of the FES could, for example, allow for notifications that don't intrude upon the dial, but are displayed around the wrist (similar to the Kairos TBand).\n\nWhile it's worth noting that Sony has yet to publish an official statement regarding its involvement in the project, given the dire outlook of its mobile technology business, it comes as no surprise that the company might be looking for innovative ideas to help it find new success in the electronics industry outside of its popular PlayStation brand.\n\nThe company's interest in e-paper wearables also looks to extend beyond watches, with a number of other accessories that make use of the tech reportedly in the works, most notably bow ties.\n\nAn individual involved with the FES Watch project discussed the product with the Wall Street Journal, stating, \"We hid Sony's name because we wanted to test the real value of the product, whether there will be demand for our concept.\"\n\nThe crowdfunding campaign is currently 80 percent towards its goal. While it's highly likely that the project would have hit its target without the revelation of Sony's involvement, it seems likely that the news will give it more than enough momentum to push it over the finish line. Initial units are expected to ship out to Japanese backers some time after May 2015.\n\nCheck out the video below for a quick look at the FES Watch in action.", "[MUSIC] If you're shopping for an eccentric tech-loving millionaire for the holidays, you're going to need some help to come up with some ideas that are a breed apart from Roku's and iPhones, and that's where I come in. I'm Donald Bell and this top five I'm counting down a cherry-picked selection of some of our most luxurious tech gifts. Pulled from our holiday tech gift guide and sorted by price. Starting things off at number five, the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+. Affordably priced at $1,400 this drone is equally adept at capturing gorgeous gimbal stabilized HD video from the air [MUSIC] As well as chasing the less fortunate off your lawn. Built in GPS means you can program it with your own flight path around the golf course. At number four, the Audeze LCD-3, quite possibly the best sounding head phones in the world according to our resident audio files Steve Gutenberg. These are hand crafted in the USA and use a unique planar magnetic driver to create their sound. The price is $1,945. You can think of them as beats for billionaires. At number three, a Mac Pro. Apple's top of the line computer starts at $3,000 and it looks like a cremation urn for a supervillain. Pair it with a 4K monitor, and you have a workstation that could satisfy any creative whim you could dream of. Is it overkill? You bet, but what fun is being rich if you can't go over the top? Speaking of overkill, at number two, the TiVo Mega. With 24 terabytes of storage, you'll never have to delete anything off your DVR again. That's enough to hold 4,000 hours of HD video. The price tag is $5,000 but if you think of it as like a $1.25 per hour, it almost sounds reasonable. But when it comes to ostentatious, high tech luxury, one item trumps them all. At number one A gigantic TV. 4K no less. And as you probably already know, that 4K resolution only becomes noticeable on a really big screen. So let's go with a really big tie for first place. At $8,000, our modest option is the unnecessarily curved 78-inch Samsung UN78HU9000. I figure if the size doesn't impress, the curves are there for a secondary WTF factor. But if you really want to see the power of reckless spending in action, try out the Sony 4k short throw projector for a mere $50,000 yu can turn a wall in your mansion into a huge crystal clear 4k tv.

Thanks for watching.", "As Black Friday bargain hunters continue to swarm stores across the country in their attempt to snag the best deals, reports have started emerging of shoppers growing violent in the frenzy for discounted wares.\n\nAt a Walmart in Houston, Texas, on Thursday night, police reportedly intervened after a fight broke out following a scramble for discounted Samsung flatscreen TVs. A YouTube video, said to have been taken at the Houston store, shows shoppers lying on top of the TVs on the ground, apparently in an attempt to prevent other people from buying them.\n\nAlso on Thursday, sheriff's deputies were called to a Walmart store in Norwalk, California, after two women started fighting over a Barbie doll, according to CBS Los Angeles. At least one of the women is reported to have thrown a punch.\n\n\"The whole thing was pretty stupid,\" a shopper told the news outlet. \"That was very dumb.\"\n\nAt a Walmart in Michigan City, Indiana, another video on YouTube allegedly shows people tussling over $88 subwoofers. \"Oh my God, that is crazy,\" one woman can be heard saying in the video as customers scrambled for the electronics.\n\nKTLA reported that three shoppers at a Kohl's store in Tustin, California, were arrested early Friday following a shopping-related altercation. The shoppers included two women and one juvenile, said KABC-TV.\n\nTwo shoppers -- a man and his girlfriend -- were also arrested at an Indianapolis mall early Friday after they allegedly attacked an off-duty police officer. WXIN reports that the man had started a fight with another man in the parking lot after being ejected from the mall for being \"too rowdy.\" An off-duty officer then tried to break up the fight, but the man and his girlfriend allegedly attacked him. The two individuals were subsequently arrested.\n\nElsewhere in the country, bargain hunters lined up for hours to get into their favorite stores. Plenty of \"shoving\" and general frenzy has been reported.\n\nAccording to the BBC, several people were arrested and some were injured following shopping-related clashes in cities across the U.K. Police had to intervene in stores in London, Cardiff, Glasgow and elsewhere, as customers quarreled over discounted goodies.", "NEW YORK (AP) - Stores are welcoming a second wave of shoppers in what has become a two-day kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\n\nThe big question: How much the Thanksgiving shopping will hurt Black Friday, which is relinquishing its status as the frenzied start of the holiday shopping season?\n\nThe crowds were thin early Friday morning in parts of the country, but traffic is expected to pick up throughout the day.\n\nOne positive sign: Toys R Us and Target executives told The Associated Press shoppers seem to be buying more than just the doorbusters and filling their carts with other items not on sale. That seems to show that lower gas prices and an improving job picture are making shoppers more confident about opening their wallets.\n\nBridget McNabb of Kansas City, Kansas, stopped at a mostly empty suburban Target around 5:30 a.m. Friday after a solid day of holiday cooking. \"I started the dishwasher and came in,\" she said.\n\nHer goal was a coffee pot for her niece. But first, the 55-year-old - who said she was \"old enough to know better\" than to be out so early - stopped at the electronics department.\n\nShe was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV her husband wanted had sold out the night before.\n\n\"I'll pop online later,\" she said.\n\nAt a Wal-Mart store near Cincinnati, Vicki Stuhlreyer of West Chester Township was on an all-night shopping marathon with her two children Brad and Madi.\n\nThey had been to several stores and malls in search of bargains, and found at the Wal-Mart what Brad wanted for his apartment - a 55-inch TV, a Samsung on sale for $548, 30 percent off.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" he said of the hours of bargain-hunting. They had breakfast at a nearby Waffle House while waiting for the 6 a.m. TV sale.\n\nMadi was still on a quest for bargains, such as for a new comforter, but hadn't been able to snag what she was looking for.\n\nThey planned to take Brad and his TV home, then decide where else to hit.\n\n\"I'm more of endurance shopper,\" said Madi, a junior bio premed student. \"I'd like to go back out again.\"\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora Illinois, the mood was calm Friday morning. Parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or nonexistent. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, who was shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly more quiet around 6:30 a.m. Friday than it was the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall to pick up some holiday deals.\n\n\"It was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,\" States said. \"Now it seems like more of the old folks.\"\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it's still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.\n\nIn a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed on Friday.\n\nWith stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAnd shoppers certainly were out in full force on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And 2,000 rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m. For Macy's 6 p.m. opening, there were more than 15,000 shoppers outside its New York flagship store, a little more than last year.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target's CEO in August and was at the East Harlem store on Thanksgiving, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n\"It's been more of a week event,\" he told The Associated Press. After luring shoppers with big discounts on TVs, Razor scooters and other items, Target is hoping to bring them back Friday with a 10 percent discount on gift cards, the first time it has cut gift card prices.\n\nCornell said he was encouraged that shoppers were buying extra items like clothing and home furnishings.\n\n\"The baskets are full,\" he added.\n\nHank Mullany, President of Toys R Us' U.S. business, also noted that shoppers were buying more than just the deep discounts.\n\nHe noted that he was pleased with traffic Thanksgiving and the second wave of customers Friday for another set of deals.\n\n\"It's more of a steady stream today,\" he added.\n\n__\n\nAP Writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Kansas, Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, and Sara Burnett in Aurora, Illinois, contributed to this report.", "Parking lots at some shopping malls filled up around the country on Friday, as shoppers kept up the tradition of scouring stores for holiday deals even though some retailers had been open on Thanksgiving and even overnight.\n\nIn Michigan City, Indiana, the Lighthouse Premium Outlet Mall was open all night long, providing opportunities for bargain-hunting to shoppers like Roberto and Robin Martinez. They started at 10 p.m. on Thursday, and were still going strong at 7 a.m. Friday.\n\nAt the North Face store, Mr. Martinez, 36, was carrying several jackets, including a $270 winter coat they were snagging for $99 for their daughter, 17. Mrs. Martinez said their shopping spree picked up basics for the kids, and would buy other items online later in the week.\n\nIn Boston, the loyal customers of Massachusetts, where Blue Laws bar retailers from opening on Thanksgiving, waited until 1 a.m. Friday to start their holiday weekend shopping.\n\nJennifer Gomes, 26, of Allston was first in line at Target at the Watertown Mall. She arrived at 5:30 p.m. and was surprised to find herself at the head of the line.\n\n\"I was like a big kid. I was flying down the street,\" she said.\n\nBig retailers, many of whom kicked off sales Thursday evening, reported brisk traffic overnight. Walmart said that 22 million shoppers streamed through stores across the country on Thanksgiving Day, more than the number of people who visit Disney's Magic Kingdom in an entire year, the retail giant pointed out.\n\nTablets, TVs, sheets, children's apparel and video games were the top five categories of the night, and Disney Frozen Snow Glow Elsa dolls was a top-selling toy, Walmart said. Best sellers online were video games, wireless prepaid phones, high-definition TVs and baby items.\n\nOver all, about 140 million people are expected to shop in stores or online this weekend. That is more people than voted in the midterms earlier this month.\n\nStill, as retailers jump-start their deals earlier and more sales move online, Black Friday itself is starting to fade in importance.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's anything such as Black Friday anymore,\" said Eric Felton, 54, while shopping at Tyson's Corner Center in McLean, Va. \"The erosion on Black Friday into Thursday has messed a lot of people up.\" Felton arrived at Tyson's mall, the region's largest shopping center with over 300 specialty stores located in northern Virginia at about 3 a.m., but as the morning began, the shopping center seemed more subdued.\n\n\"I think everyone is avoiding Friday,\" said Cindy Leonard who brought her 10-month old to see Santa. Expecting to hit traffic, she arrived early and and browsed but quickly turned to her smartphone, sighing \"I'm ordering the things on my phone that I couldn't find in Pottery Barn.\" And\n\nCasey Brefka, 28, waited in line for Best Buy at Watertown, Mass., said he had grown up in Ohio, now lived in Allston, and wanted to see how the Black Friday scenes compared.\n\n\"I got used to the crowds in Ohio, so one of the things is like, 'Oh, how many people are going to be here when we pull into the parking lot?' And I was kinda disappointed. Like, there weren't that many.\"\n\nMr. Brefka, who works for the Department of Public Health, said he did most of his shopping online. But he showed up around midnight Thursday in hopes of landing a 50-inch Panasonic LED HDTV for $200 - a deal available only in store.\n\nTarget said its best-selling goods in store were the Element 40\" TV, the Xbox One, iPads and Nikon's L330 camera. In the first hour of stores opening, Target sold 1,800 TVs per minute and 2,000 video games per minute, the retailer said in a release. Keurig's K40 brewer and Dyson's DC50 vacuum were other top sellers, Target said.\n\nRetailers were not providing specific sales figures.\n\nEconomists are closely watching whether retailers can entice shoppers to spend during what retailers consider the biggest shopping weekend of the year, especially after a year of lackluster sales so far. A brightening economic outlook, and ever-cheaper gas prices, are starting to lift consumer confidence. But there are also signs of lingering wariness among consumers, after what has been an uneven economic recovery marked by anemic wage growth, especially for low-income households.\n\nIn Manchester, Iowa, Russell Marriott enlisted a babysitter and grandmother to watch his two children as he and his wife -- both unemployed -- trekked to Walmart at 3 a.m. He spent most of the day perched at the back corner of the store waiting for the $329 Xbox One Halo The Master Chief Collection Bundle; she waited in a separate line for an Xbox controller.\n\nSaving money is important for them, he said, and his wife wanted the game.\n\n\"It makes a difference,\" Mr. Marriott said.\n\nStores are doing their best to get consumers to spend, luring shoppers to their stores with some eye-popping deals that could increase traffic but also eat away at thinning profit margins.\n\nThe \"doorbuster\" deal at Staples is an Asus 11.6-inch Intel laptop priced at just $100. At Target, the Element 40-inch flat-screen television will carry a price tag of just $119. And Toys \"R\" Us is offering a Polaroid 7-inch Android Tablet priced at just $20.\n\nAnd online, which makes up a bigger share of holiday sales each year, retailers have been offering Black Friday deals for many days now, stretching what was once a one-day shopping frenzy into a week or more of sales.\n\nOnline retailers have also driven the heavier-than-ever discounting this year. Amazon has priced out many of the country's biggest retailers in the big-ticket holiday items, offering a Samsung 55-inch 4K flat-screen television for $899. Dealnews.com, which closely tracks Black Friday deals, declared Amazon's deal \"without a doubt\" the cheapest name-brand 4K television it had ever seen.\n\nIBM Digital Analytics, which tracks online shopping transactions in the United States, said sales rose 12 percent between midnight and 6 p.m. Eastern time Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, an industry group, predicts that sales in November and December, excluding auto, gas and restaurant sales, will rise 4.1 percent from the same months last year to $616.9 billion. That is a slightly faster clip compared with the 2013 holiday season, when sales grew 3.1 percent and made up roughly a fifth of the retail sector's annual sales of about $3.2 trillion.\n\n\"It's been a very tough, challenging retail environment. A lot of retailers want to get out earlier and win some of those sales before their competitors do,\" said James Russo, senior vice president of global consumer insights at the New York-based research firm, Nielsen.\n\n\"But consumers are now so trained to wait for those aggressive promotions,\" Mr. Russo said. \"And they will.\"\n\nHere are a few more scenes and themes from shoppers around the country:\n\nTHE SOCIAL SCENE\n\nBut for scores of young adults and families in lines curled around a corner in West Hollywood, Calif., shopping on Black Friday is as much a social outing as it is a bargain hunt.\n\n\"It's a tradition. I've done it since I was a kid,\" said Kim Ly, 22, in line at Best Buy. Ms. Ly, a shoe consultant from Hollywood, was with two roommates, both of whom said shopping on Black Friday had in recent years become something of an event.\n\nMs. Ly and one roommate, Ashley Gray, 22, said they considered heading out early for deals an efficient way to start their Christmas shopping, despite having had their credit cards hacked in a widespread breach last year.\n\n\"As sad as it is, it doesn't stop me,\" Ms. Gray said of shopping on Black Friday, despite the security risk.\n\n\"I feel Black Friday is a fair and safe way to shop,\" Ms. Ly said, citing an in-store purchase as a secure alternative to online shopping.\n\nAmin Hashemi, 16, and his friends were the first in line to buy a 40-inch Samsung Smart television for $328, down from $500, and Beats by Dre headphones for $97, down from $170.\n\n\"It's not all about the shopping. We enjoy hanging out,\" he said, as he also waited with his grandmother, 60, who is visiting from Iran. \"My grandmother wanted to come earlier to experience this. This is an experience.\"\n\nHOLIDAY SCHEDULES FOR WORKERS\n\nThese are long days for retail workers, some of whom have objected to the encroachment of open stores on holidays like Thanksgiving while others express a willingness to work to earn extra pay.\n\nLenwood Williams, head of security at the DC USA shopping center, arrived to ensure orderly lines. He shared a small Thanksgiving feast with his fellow guards, all of them who had snacked throughout the day while on break.\n\nHe said this year was the first time the shopping center provided a Thanksgiving meal for the 16 guards on duty. (Last year, stores did not open until 9 p.m., so there was no need for it.)\n\n\"I chose to be here on Thanksgiving to make sure things ran smoothly,\" he said.\n\nTENSIONS IN THE CROWD\n\nAnd at the Walmart Supercenter in Apopka, an employee helped quell a disturbance among some shoppers waiting in line.\n\n\"They got a little antsy because it wasn't moving fast enough,\" said the employee, Nykee Harrell, 24, who was making $12 an hour for the shift, considerably more than his usual $8. \"I had to step in and calm that situation. I'm the extra muscle.\"\n\nA few minutes later, a horde of customers raced to grab DVDs and CDs when store employees dropped a yellow tape -- not unlike a crime-scene barrier -- and allowed the throng to help themselves to the shelves in that particular section.\n\n\"Once you've got our item, please move back!\" an employee shouted into a megaphone.\n\n\"It's always a bit of a mess when they let them in,\" another worker, Tina Toole, said. \"They get crazy. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nBrandon Chapman, a 19-year-old senior at Apopka High School, was able to grab three DVDs for $4 each, and seemed pleased with the deal. But the crowd, he said, was a drawback.\n\n\"My advice is to get here early and wear body armor,\" he said.\n\nTHE THRILL OF THE HUNT\n\nChris Garity, 43, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a county clerk and mother of three, hit five stores on Thanksgiving evening, went home for a three-hour nap, then rose at 4 a.m. to jump on her laptop and do some online shopping (Walmart and Best Buy, the stores she didn't want to go to in person). She then snoozed a bit and set her alarm for Menards, arriving at 6:20 a.m. \"I'm tired,\" Ms. Garity said. \"My eyes burn. Do I need any of this? No! I could've stayed in bed. But this is fun. It's a high. I love a good deal. It's just my wiring.\"\n\nHer cart overflowed with storage bins, four packs of batteries, three cell-phone charging dock ($25 each), a 1-pound Snickers bar for $8 (normally $10, she said!), car starter kit, even a tub of doggie treats for her dogs - something for everyone.\n\nAs for shopping in stores versus online, Ms. Garity said she got an adrenaline rush from being inside a store. \"The online is a good thing, but it doesn't give you the experience. There's nobody to share it with. You push a button and it's done.\"\n\nTHE ROAD TO AUSTIN\n\nRoughly 200 shoppers were lined up outside Fry's Electronics off Mopac Expressway in far north Austin, Texas, shortly before the electronics superstore's scheduled 5 a.m. Black Friday opening, many of them bundled up against brisk pre-dawn temperatures in the mid- to- upper 40s.\n\nAt the head of the line were four young men who drove from Killeen, about 60 miles north of Austin, on Thanksgiving night get an early start on the deals.\n\nThe four friends - Cody Comacho, 24, a Killeen movie theater employee, Christopher Benavides, 21, and Colt Cress, 21, both students at Killeen's Central Texas College, and Andrew Thurman of Lampasas, 21, an employee at a Walmart Store - climbed into a two-door Dodge Challenger about 10 p.m. Thursday and arrived at Fry's an hour later, surprised to find that they were the first to arrive for the Black Friday deals.\n\n\"We thought that people would be here already,\" said Mr. Camacho.\n\nThe prospective shoppers endured the chilly six-hour wait before the store opened by operating in shifts, with two staking out their place in line while two others warmed up inside the car. About two hours after midnight, Mr. Camacho and Mr. Thurman made a run to a nearby McDonald's to pick up 10 McChickens and soft drinks.\n\nThe Black Friday quartet was in the store for about 30 minutes, spending a total of about $1,100 in cash that Mr. Camacho said the four men had saved over the last several weeks. They were back in Killeen before 9 a.m., beaming over deals that resulted in markdowns totaling about $600, Mr. Camacho said. Between them, they came away with a new laptop, an Xbox, a monitor and other computer components. \"I hope to do this again next year,\" he said. \"I'll start saving tomorrow.\"\n\nJohn Albert Juarez, 32, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, made an even longer trip from his Central Texas hometown of Seguin, more than 75 miles from Austin, and was outside Fry's as the line began shuffling inside the store at 5 a.m. while his 13-year-old daughter and a cousin slept in their car in the parking lot.\n\nThey arrived in Austin about 6 p.m. Thanksgiving Day and planned to work through a list of 19 specific stores before returning to Sequin. As he made the rounds in Fry's, he said, the out-of-town shoppers had \"ten down, nine to go\" and were operating on a budget of about $500. Mr. Juarez said he calls up \"all the stores personally\" to find out opening and closing times for Thanksgiving and Black Friday.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to come away with \"just the things we need from day to day\" purchased at a discount of 50 percent off, items ranging from cologne to gloves to pajamas. He said he also tries to negotiate further savings with clerks at the check-out counter. His daughter plays basketball and Mr. Juarez is a bicycling and exercise enthusiast, so sporting goods stores figured prominently on their shopping hit list.", "Black Friday retailers lose out to Thanksgiving hours, online shopping\n\n\"People were all the way around the back to the dumpsters,\" Sharpton said. \"It was cold too.\"\n\nBack at his house, Sharpton used the time to do some online research, and when he returned to Best Buy on Black Friday morning, he was able to quickly locate the items he purchased: a Samsung 40-inch Smart TV and Yamaha surround sound system.\n\nSharpton said another plus of shopping Black Friday was avoiding the Thanksgiving crowds. He described the in-store traffic at Best Buy on Friday as \"any other regular day.\"\n\nNear Best Buy, several store parking lots within the Augusta Exchange shopping center remained half-full by mid-morning.\n\nBlack Friday, which for years has reigned the supreme shopping day of the holiday season, is now getting a chunk taken out by retailers choosing to open early on Thanksgiving. Kmart opened as early as 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving this year, while dozens of other national retailers welcomed customers in the early evening.\n\nIn the National Retail Federation's early predictions of the 2014 Thanksgiving shopping weekend, which runs from Thursday to Sunday, it expected 18.3 percent, or almost 26 million, of consumers would shop Thanksgiving. More than 68 percent, or 95.5 million, of shoppers were predicted to take advantage of Black Friday sales.\n\nLast year, the NRF said that 141 million shoppers spent $57 billion during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend. About 45 million consumers shopped on Thanksgiving, while another 92 million headed out to stores on Black Friday.\n\nBecause Thanksgiving shopping is still somewhat of a new phenomenon, Georgia Southern University Associate Economics Professor Tony Barilla said it's difficult to gauge what type of dent the Thursday sales will put on revenue generated during Black Friday.\n\n\"Businesses use hind site to judge consumer reactions,\" he said. \"If sale revenues continue to improve by having Thanksgiving shopping then they will provide Thanksgiving shopping.\"\n\nStill, Barilla does not see Black Friday in danger of falling off the top of the holiday shopping days.\n\n\"That is an established event with no potential holiday backlash,\" Barilla said. \"Most Americans have the day off, and are just coming out of their turkey coma so retailers will continue to attract people to a pure shopping event.\"\n\nNot one for Thanksgiving or Black Friday shopping, Jenni Richey loaded up on toys for her five young children at Toys \"R\" Us in Augusta in hopes that crowd sizes would be light Friday. She was in luck, as lines were short Friday morning at the national chain toy store off Wrightsboro Road.\n\n\"I figured all the crowds were gone since they opened so early (Thursday) that it would be pretty much just like shopping on a normal day, but with sales,\" she said. \"I think Thanksgiving should be closed still.\"\n\nFor Wadene Welch, also at Toys \"R\" Us, Black Friday shopping is a family tradition she started 25 years ago with her own children, now grown. On Friday, Welch was accompanied by her three daughters and a granddaughter.\n\n\"It's just the excitement of getting ready for the holidays and all the family getting together,\" she said.\n\nThe group of women had already stopped by stores in the Augusta Exchange and were headed next to the Augusta Mall and Surrey Center. They stood united in refusing to shop Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" said Welch, of the diminished Black Friday traffic. \"We used to fight for those cabbage patch dolls when these three were little.\"\n\nNext door, at the Augusta Mall, General Manager Andy Wilke said that about 100 retailers chose to open Thanksgiving night and the remaining 30 stores opened Friday morning.\n\nThe majority of those retailers open Thanksgiving beat last year's sales numbers, led by H&M, Michael Kors and Bath & Body Works, Wilke said.\n\nThe mall saw its highest shopper count on Thanksgiving between 8 and 10 p.m., Wilke said.\n\n\"People seemed to trickle in throughout the night rather than rush in the mall right at opening,\" he said.\n\nWilke said Black Friday traffic would likely peak at mid-day and hold steady into the night.\n\nThe mall had a traffic plan in place, which consisted of cones and barricades that directed vehicles in and out of the property. Richmond County sheriff's deputies also helped with traffic flow.\n\nAt Stein Mart on Washington Road, foot traffic was light but steady Friday morning. Store general manager Dona Montgomery expected a rush of customers to visit the store during afternoon hours.\n\nThis year, the retailer also opened on Thanksgiving for its first year.\n\n\"I think it's going to be really successful for the company overall,\" Montgomery said. \"We did have a good turnout (Thursday) night.\"", "Seamus Bellamy : Right now, 4K television sets which are also known as UHD TVs, are the pinnacle of home theatre display technology.

So with 4K technology, using a giant television as the centre of your home entertainment setup in a tiny bachelor's suite is a viable option.\n\nThat said, you should hold off on buying one, if you can, for as long as possible, for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, 4K is by no means a guaranteed standard of what is soon to come. Remember the HD DVD/Blu-Ray war of a few years ago? See anyone making HD DVD players these days? Yeah, me either. With ultra-high definition television still very much in its infancy, it could very well come to pass that 4K resolution hardware won't become the de facto standard. The schism's already there: A lot of movies being released digitally to theatres are offered in 4096 x 2160 resolution. But many UHD televisions come packing a lower 3840 x 2160 resolution. What's more, Apple unveiled their new 27\" iMac with Retina Display, which is capable of presenting a 5k image packed full of 5120 x 2880 pixels! I dare you to look me in the eye and tell me that the 4K standard won't be challenged in the coming months.\n\nSecond, there's precious little to watch. While Netflix is ramping up a number of their most popular programs, like Breaking Bad, to 4K resolutions, it's hard to justify the lofty purchase price of a Ultra High Definition television set or 4K display. In fact, there's so little content out there that a fancy ultra high-definition TV can show off its crazy pixel density with that Samsung is currently selling a hard drive pre-loaded with 30 documentaries presented in UHD resolution and nine 'Hollywood movies in near-UHD quality.' It'll set you back about $400. Such a deal. But then, if you've got between $1600 and $4600 to spend on a television set, I guess that's a drop in the bucket.\n\nWith such a small amount of ultra high definition content to watch and no set standard for the next generation television hardware, you'd be nuts to invest in a 4K/HD TV right now.", "Today is Black Friday, and if you're not out dodging elbows in a big retail store already, you're probably looking forward to the great deals you can find online for the rest of the week, known as Cyber Week.\n\nSamsung is no stranger to Black Friday and Cyber Week sales, and this year, the Galaxy Note 4 and the Note Edge are the newest devices most sought after in the Samsung product line.\n\nVerizon Wireless is having a great deal on the Galaxy Note 4 at the tone of $199 when you sign up for a two-year contract. That's a savings of $100 off the original on-contract price.\n\nBut Best Buy has even better deal if you're looking for an array of cell provider options. You can get the Galaxy Note 4 for free when you sign up for a two-year contract with either AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint. Plus, Best Buy will even throw in a $50 gift card on top of that, so it's almost like you're getting paid to take the phone.\n\nT-Mobile has a similar deal on the surface, but it's just part of an extended payment plan. You get the phablet for no money down with a two-year service agreement, but you're paying $31.24 a month for 24 months to pay the phone off.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 4 is Samsung's latest Android smartphone that was just released in October of this year. It features a 2560 x 1440 Quad HD Super AMOLED 5.7-inch display, a 2.7 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor (LTE Cat6 edition), 3 GB RAM, 32 or 64 GB of flash memory, and an impressive 16 MP rear camera. It's comparable to Google's own popular Nexus 6 smartphone and currently runs on Android 4.4.4 Kitkat with an unknown upgrade date to Android 5.0 Lollipop.\n\nThe Galaxy Note Edge, on the other hand, is a revolutionary new device that offers an extended display on the edge of the phone for a whole different type of dual interface. The Galaxy Note Edge shares many of the same technical and hardware specs as the Galaxy Note 4, but the curved display allows for more versatility. Of course, this innovation comes at a higher price, which is why finding a deal this weekend and next week will be important.\n\nRight now, only T-Mobile has a special Black Friday price for the brand new Galaxy Note Edge, and that's part of its no-money-down deal. Get the Galaxy Note Edge with a two-year service agreement and you can take it home without paying a dime. You will need to pay $36.25 a month for the next 24 months to pay it off, which comes to $870 total.\n\nT-Mobile is also offering a free Alcatel OneTouch Pop 7 tablet to anyone buying a phone and T-Mobile cell plan of 1 GB or higher. This deal is only available at participating T-Mobile locations and is for a limited time with limited supply, so call ahead to your local store to check availability.\n\nBe aware that if you cancel your wireless contract, you'll owe T-Mobile $168, the tablet's full retail cost.", "Happy Black Friday, Arsians!

The Korean manufacturer is speeding things up in Note Edge territory, with the device with the Galaxy Note Edge made available for folks over in the UK, for pre-ordering.\n\nFor those of you in the UK, you can learn more about the Galaxy Note Edge's pre-ordering here. The Galaxy Note Edge was shown by Samsung along with the Galaxy Note 4 this year. For folks over here in the US, this could be a good reason to hold of your Note 4 purchases this Black Friday.\n\nThe Galaxy Note Edge is the first of its kind in tablets to display your notifications in a complete new space. The device will be available in Charcoal Black and Frost Wide. Specifications remain similar to those found on Samsung's Galaxy Note 4.\n\nThe device features a Super AMOLED, 5.7 inch curved screen with a resolution of 1440 x 2560. Processor for the Galaxy Note Edge is a Snapdragon 805, with a frequency of 2.7 GHz which will be coupled with 2 GB of RAM and 32 or 64 GB of internal storage.\n\nHowever, since the device is being launched with the Snapdragon 805 on board, which is 32-bit in nature, you shouldn't expect it to have complete functionality with Android Lollipop. Google's latest OS is 64-bit in nature, which is one of the major changes introduced in this year's update.\n\nCamera specifications for the Galaxy Note Edge include a 16 MP rear camera with OIS and a 3.7 MP front camera. The Galaxy Note Edge's launch in the UK is good news for all Samsung fans out there. But will you be purchasing the device if it comes only with the Snapdragon 805?

Officers from the Stafford Police Department and the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Department were called to a WalMart where shoppers were seen pushing, shoving and shouting over a Samsung television, Click 2 Houston reports. The frugal-fueled brawl was caught on video and posted to YouTube.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Two people were arrested after a brawl on Black Friday at a northwest side mall.\n\nThe incident happened around 3 a.m. in the 51100 block of Pike Plaza Rd. According to police, a male was too rowdy inside of the mall, and he was thrown out. The man then got in a fight with another man outside in the parking lot.\n\nThe officers working security detail didn't see the fight, but they saw the victim's bloody nose. An off-duty officer told the suspect to leave. The suspect refused to leave and he started punching the off-duty officer in the jaw. The suspect's girlfriend then showed up and also started hitting the off-duty office.\n\nBoth the male suspect and his girlfriend were arrested. The officer was not hurt.\n\nHOUSTON -- Gripping and swatting -- that's the gist of an altercation that transpired between shoppers fighting over a convertible child's car.

With its crystal clear picture that wraps around you like you're in a theater. The new Samsung curved TV is designed to draw you in.\n\nCurved is correct. If you actually think about it.

Using a minimalist approach, the brainiacs at Sony come up with a funky new watch with a monochrome e-paper display and as few markings to indicate the time as possible. It is called the Fes watch. So what is the point behind?\n\nThe watch is experimental and isn't meant to go to sale, instead its meant to test materials used in fashion products. It definitely has none of the features typical smart watches do but with such a simple display, the battery certainly manages to impress, able to last almost two months without needed to be charged.\n\nStuart Miles, a gadget expert from Pocket-lint describes the watch as \"retro and cool\". It certainly is a different take on the concept of smart watches since most others including entries from Sony itself have made wearables quite feature rich.

That seems to show that lower gas prices and an improving job picture are making shoppers more confident about opening their wallets.\n\nBridget McNabb of Kansas City, Kansas, stopped at a mostly empty suburban Target around 5:30 a.m. Friday after a solid day of holiday cooking. \"I started the dishwasher and came in,\" she said.\n\nHer goal was a coffee pot for her niece. But first, the 55-year-old -- who said she was \"old enough to know better\" than to be out so early -- stopped at the electronics department.\n\nShe was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV her husband wanted had sold out the night before.\n\n\"I'll pop online later,\" she said.\n\nAt a Wal-Mart store near Cincinnati, Vicki Stuhlreyer of West Chester Township was on an all-night shopping marathon with her two children Brad and Madi.\n\nThey had been to several stores and malls in search of bargains, and found at the Wal-Mart what Brad wanted for his apartment -- a 55-inch TV, a Samsung on sale for $548, 30 percent off.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" he said of the hours of bargain-hunting. They had breakfast at a nearby Waffle House while waiting for the 6 a.m. TV sale.\n\nMadi was still on a quest for bargains, such as for a new comforter, but hadn't been able to snag what she was looking for.\n\nThey planned to take Brad and his TV home, then decide where else to hit.\n\n\"I'm more of endurance shopper,\" said Madi, a junior bio premed student. \"I'd like to go back out again.\"\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora Illinois, the mood was calm Friday morning. Parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or nonexistent. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, who was shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly more quiet around 6:30 a.m. Friday than it was the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall to pick up some holiday deals.\n\n\"It was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,\" States said. \"Now it seems like more of the old folks.\"\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it's still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.\n\nIn a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed on Friday.\n\nWith stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAnd shoppers certainly were out in full force on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And 2,000 rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m. For Macy's 6 p.m. opening, there were more than 15,000 shoppers outside its New York flagship store, a little more than last year.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target's CEO in August and was at the East Harlem store on Thanksgiving, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n\"It's been more of a week event,\" he told The Associated Press. After luring shoppers with big discounts on TVs, Razor scooters and other items, Target is hoping to bring them back Friday with a 10 percent discount on gift cards, the first time it has cut gift card prices.\n\nCornell said he was encouraged that shoppers were buying extra items like clothing and home furnishings.\n\n\"The baskets are full,\" he added.\n\nHank Mullany, President of Toys R Us' U.S. business, also noted that shoppers were buying more than just the deep discounts.\n\nHe noted that he was pleased with traffic Thanksgiving and the second wave of customers Friday for another set of deals.\n\n\"It's more of a steady stream today,\" he added.", "NEW YORK (AP) -- Stores are welcoming a second wave of shoppers in what has become a two-day kickoff to the holiday shopping season.\n\nThe big question: How much the Thanksgiving shopping will hurt Black Friday, which is relinquishing its status as the frenzied start of the holiday shopping season?\n\nThe crowds were thin early Friday morning in parts of the country, but traffic is expected to pick up throughout the day.\n\nOne positive sign: Toys R Us and Target executives told The Associated Press shoppers seem to be buying more than just the doorbusters and filling their carts with other items not on sale.

But first, the 55-year-old -- who said she was \"old enough to know better\" than to be out so early -- stopped at the electronics department.\n\nShe was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV her husband wanted had sold out the night before.\n\n\"I'll pop online later,\" she said.\n\nAt a Wal-Mart store near Cincinnati, Vicki Stuhlreyer of West Chester Township was on an all-night shopping marathon with her two children Brad and Madi.\n\nThey had been to several stores and malls in search of bargains, and found at the Wal-Mart what Brad wanted for his apartment -- a 55-inch TV, a Samsung on sale for $548, 30 percent off.\n\n\"It was worth it,\" he said of the hours of bargain-hunting. They had breakfast at a nearby Waffle House while waiting for the 6 a.m. TV sale.\n\nMadi was still on a quest for bargains, such as for a new comforter, but hadn't been able to snag what she was looking for.\n\nThey planned to take Brad and his TV home, then decide where else to hit.\n\n\"I'm more of endurance shopper,\" said Madi, a junior bio premed student. \"I'd like to go back out again.\"\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora Illinois, the mood was calm Friday morning. Parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or nonexistent. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, who was shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly more quiet around 6:30 a.m. Friday than it was the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall to pick up some holiday deals.\n\n\"It was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,\" States said. \"Now it seems like more of the old folks.\"\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it's still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.\n\nIn a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed on Friday.\n\nWith stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nAnd shoppers certainly were out in full force on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere were 500 people in line by the time a Target store in New York City's East Harlem neighborhood opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And 2,000 rushed in at the Toys R Us in New York City's Times Square when it opened at 5 p.m. For Macy's 6 p.m. opening, there were more than 15,000 shoppers outside its New York flagship store, a little more than last year.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target's CEO in August and was at the East Harlem store on Thanksgiving, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n\"It's been more of a week event,\" he told The Associated Press. After luring shoppers with big discounts on TVs, Razor scooters and other items, Target is hoping to bring them back Friday with a 10 percent discount on gift cards, the first time it has cut gift card prices.\n\nCornell said he was encouraged that shoppers were buying extra items like clothing and home furnishings.\n\n\"The baskets are full,\" he added.\n\nHank Mullany, President of Toys R Us' U.S. business, also noted that shoppers were buying more than just the deep discounts.\n\nHe noted that he was pleased with traffic Thanksgiving and the second wave of customers Friday for another set of deals.\n\nAP Writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Kansas, Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, and Sara Burnett in Aurora, Illinois, contributed to this report.", "November has seen some really important reviews hit Android Central, including reviews of the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Samsung Gear S ... along with an in-depth Review of Android 5.0 Lollipop too!

It's worth a look.", "Sony introduced its new smartwatch made of electronic paper Thursday, only two days after details about the device surfaced.\n\nThe prototype, called the FES watch, was developed through the Japanese electronics giant's \"Fashion Entertainments\" project, which a company spokesman said is aimed at creating fashion products with e-paper, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe device can change its appearance based on the gestures the user makes, and it features 24 design patterns that users can choose manually. A person who worked on the project said its goal was to give electronic paper the ability to function as a fabric.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign for the wristband started in September, and the watch has so far raised 3.5 million yen ($30,000) from over 150 supporters, surpassing its goal of 2 million yen ($17,000) in just three weeks.\n\nThe FES watch's appearance resembles that of the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear S and other competitors, but it doesn't include a GPS, heart-rate monitors or other high-tech features that have been featured in most smartwatches, CNET reported.\n\nE-paper shows black and white texts and images and doesn't need as much power to work as other mobile devices do. As a result, the FES watch's battery can last for up to 60 days.\n\nThe FES watch is the latest crowdfunded smartwatch designed to feature e-ink technology, following the footsteps of the Pebble Watch, which gained enough popularity for the development of a sequel, the Pebble Steel.\n\n\"We hid Sony's name because we wanted to test the real value of the product, whether there will be demand for our concept,\" a person who worked on the project said to the The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhile an official release date has yet to be revealed, Sony said those who preorder the FES will have to wait until after May of 2015 to receive it.", "Summary: Lenovo in the past has created short videos to take occasional shots at the competing MacBook Air, and this week the company was back at it again.\n\nLenovo has become one of Apple's biggest challengers in the personal computer landscape. That being said, a few months ago Lenovo made news when they teamed up with Microsoft to make a video that would take a shot at Apple for their one-dimensional laptops. Once again, Lenovo was at it again this week on the heels of the launch and release of their latest laptop the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro.\n\nIn the video while demonstrating how the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro bends both ways, and can hold many different positions, and essentially function as a tablet - as well as a full-blown laptop - the demonstrator breaks an Apple MacBook Air, while attempting to show the same functionality. Cue up a fleeing associate, who isn't actually an associate at all at the display, the entrance of the \"real employee\" as well as a security guard to really drive home the fear that the unsuspecting bystanders are undoubtedly feeling, and just over two-minutes later - the big reveal happens when they find out they're a part of Lenovo's next advertising campaign.\n\nSamsung is already famous for such cheap promotions. In spite of such promotions, everyone knows what happened with their Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5. Now, Lenovo is on footsteps of Samsung.\n\nWhat's in the computer though? The Yoga 3 Pro is powered by an Intel Core M-5Y70 CPU with a 1.1 GHz processor. Add in an impressive 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of hard drive space and what you're left with is an impressive 2-in-1 when you consider the fact that it is both a laptop and a tablet. If that's not enough, the Yoga Pro 3 also brings a 13.3-inch display, which is an equivalent to the Yoga Pro 2. Perhaps the most impressive physical feature of the device isn't the screen or flexibility, but rather the Intel integrated HD 5300 card that gives the device some serious power when it comes to gaming.\n\nSee Also: LG G3 32GB Smartphone with AT&T/Sprint contract for $0.01 + free shipping\n\nThe Yoga 3 Pro won't falter under extreme use either, with the flexibility that the device has. It has a single-metal band design that basically acts like a strengthened metal watchband. The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro is relatively expensive though compared to other similar devices. It's even more expensive than the MacBook Air, which for an Apple product to win in the price category - really says something - when the company really doesn't dabble in the low-end of anything in the tech space.\n\nSee Also: HTC One M8 for $0.01 with 2-Year Contract at Verizon, AT&T, Sprint + free shipping\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro starts at $1,299 compared to the MacBook Air, which starts well-below the $1,000-mark. All-in-all this is a device that if you're looking for functionality beyond a laptop, or something that can work as a tablet while you're on the run - then this would be a better investment. But, if you're looking for a laptop that focuses on functionality - then this is likely not the device for you.\n\n[Source]", "Some might call it blasphemy. But millions of Americans hit the stores and went online Thursday in search of early Black Friday bargains. It's all part of the \"Black Friday creep\" that has seen more and more retailers open their doors on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nLast year, 45 million people shopped on Thanksgiving Day, 92 million on Black Friday and 131 million on Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nMany consumers dread facing the crowds, long lines and frayed tempers to get at those rock-bottom deals.\n\nKacee Lundell, of Fontana isn't one of them. She was the first in line at the Target in the northeast part of Ontario. Lundell said she has been the first in line for Black Friday deals for the last couple of years.\n\nThis year she was planning on buying several electronic items including a 60-inch Samsung Smart television which normally retails for $1,200 but on sale for $800.\n\n\"It's your own prerogative. I'm getting a TV for $400 dollars cheaper than I would normally. You are not going to find that on a normal day of the week,\" Lundell said.\n\nIn Rialto, Walmart had a large police presence after three fights last year disrupted Black Friday sales.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" said Lia Rhames, 51, of Rialto. \"We were in the store and people were shoving old people over and they didn't even care.\"\n\nThere were at least a dozen Walmart employees, wearing yellow vests, standing outside the store to help direct traffic. This year Walmart shoppers in Rialto were allowed to form lines inside the store.\n\nBut at least one customer had enough an hour before the 6 p.m. sales began.\n\n\"It's already pretty crazy in there. People are going through different parts of the store to get into the front of the line,\" Rhames said. \"It's not even worth it to me, I'm leaving. It's not worth the fussing and arguing, and not worth the risk.\"\n\nRhames had come with her daughter to try and grab a discount on some headphones but instead decided to head out to the Old Navy in Ontario Mills Mall to see what bargains they could find.\n\nAnd there will be plenty. Shoppers were expected to find more discounted items Thursday than on Black Friday. There were a total of 86 lap tops and tablets deeply discounted as door-buster deals at Best Buy, Walmart and other stores Thursday compared with just nine on Black Friday, according to an analysis of promotions for The Associated Press by researcher Market Track.\n\nAmazon, Target and Macy's and other retailers are also offering speedier delivery, including overnight and same-day options that will continue even past the holidays.\n\nThe focus on faster shipping is one way retailers are catering to shoppers who've become increasingly finicky and impatient. Since the recession, it's not enough to get lower prices; they want the deepest discounts. And when it comes to ordering online, orders need to be shipped fast.\n\nBusiness at Newegg's distribution center in Industry is expected to be humming today with deals that include an ASUS 23.8-inch-wide computer screen for $149 and a Pantum P2050 Monochrome Laser Printer for $39.99. Target, Walmart, Kohl's and other big-box retailers have also stepped up their online deals. Kohl's is encouraging consumers to \"shop over 500 of the coolest Black Friday deals online now.\"\n\nWalmart stores hired 60,000 seasonal workers this year, a 10 percent increase over last year. Company spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said Walmart stores were less chaotic than many since they were open all day on Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We've been open 24 hours on Thanksgiving Day since 1988,\" she said. \"So customers can come in and do some regular shopping while they wait for the events to begin.\"\n\nWalmart stores are offering several Black Friday events this year, including a \"one-hour guarantee sale.\" Customers who were in designated lines at Walmart between 6 and 7 p.m. Thanksgiving Day could purchase several top gifts at a \"New Black Friday\" discount price and either take the merchandise home or receive it at the store before Christmas.\n\nWalmart stores had 22 million Thanksgiving Day shoppers last year and the mega retailer predicted a bigger turnout this year.\n\nThe National Retail Federation said holiday sales will increase 4.1 percent this year -- a full percentage point higher than last year's increase. That would equate to $616.9 billion, with the average American spending $804.\n\nTarget stores hired 70,000 seasonal workers this year and Kohl's added 67,000, a 34 percent boost over last year.\n\nPhil Lempert, a Santa Monica-based analyst on consumer behavior and marketing trends, said an increasing number of retailers are feeling pressured to jump in earlier with Black Friday sales.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"But I also think we'll see a backlash with some retail chains saying, 'We value our employers and their families.' And so I think you'll see a divide where some retailers will start their sales even earlier, like on Wednesday, so they can be closed on Thanksgiving.\"\n\nWith all of these deep discounts flying around, some might wonder if stores are shaving their profit margins too thin. Lempert doesn't think so.\n\n\"People forget that these places don't put a lot of things on sale,\" he said. \"They might feature five TVs that are well below cost, but that's just to get people in the door. Most consumers are becoming more aware of that reality. But you'll always have the people who love bargain hunting and will get out there early.\"\n\nLempert has some definite thoughts on over-eager shoppers who set up camp in front of a store days in advance of a big sale.\n\n\"They need to get a life,\" he said.", "A few months back we first started hearing about Samsung's Galaxy A-series of smartphones, models that would build off the design of the Galaxy Alpha while offering some new hardware configurations. It looked like we'd see three such handsets arrive, the Galaxy A3, A5, and A7, but when Samsung finally got around to launching them right at the end of October, only the A3 and the A5 made the docket. Where was the A7? We've still yet to get official word on the phone's fate, but it sure looks like Samsung's moving forward with the model, as this week its certification paperwork surfaces at the FCC.\n\nJust like we saw that Samsung User Agent Profile for its model SM-A700FD last month, the FCC paperwork confirms the very same model number. Test data shows band support for 3G 850/1900MHz, in addition to LTE band 5. That's not a particularly popular LTE band, supported by US Cellular and a couple South Korean carriers, and if we had to guess we'd bet that this indicates that Samsung's planning on first making the A7 available in its home nation.\n\nBut when will it actually be announced? Well, your guess is as good as ours, with no Samsung press event on our calendar for December. We suppose it's possible that Samsung could hold this guy back until CES, but it's just as likely that we'll see the phone make a more low-key introduction sometime in the weeks before that trade show.\n\nSource: FCC\n\nVia: phoneArena", "60-inch Sharp LC-60UQ17U 240Hz 3D Smart TV is Special Amazon Black Friday Deal Today\n\nThe Amazon Black Friday 2014 Sale has launched on Friday 11/21.

In particular, the 4K TV, an ultra high-def system, is expected to be popular.\n\n\"If you want to sell televisions to the American public, then you need two things,\" said Stephen Baker, an analyst at NPD. \"They need to be as big as they can afford, and they need to have the best picture that they want.

The scenes led one senior police officer to call on shoppers to ask themselves: \"What on Earth was I doing?\"\n\nA number of stores were closed after fights broke out between shoppers trying to get their hands on sale stock. A police spokesman said a woman was injured at a Tesco store in Stretford, Manchester, \"after being hit by a falling television\".\n\nA man was arrested on suspicion of assault at a Tesco store in Salford. Greater Manchester police used their Twitter feed to urge customers to keep calm.\n\nMany shoppers were determined to bag a bargain, regardless of what it was. Louise Haggerty, a hairdresser and waitress shopping at 1am at a Sainsbury's in north-east London, said: \"I got a Dyson but I don't even know if I want it. I just picked it up.\" The 56-year-old said she had wanted a new flatscreen TV, \"but so many people pushed in the queue, we didn't have a chance. People were behaving like animals, it was horrible.\"\n\nAt the same store, Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, had two trolleys full of bargains. \"I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\" he said. \"I couldn't tell you the prices, but I know they're bargains.\"\n\nThe Black Friday extravaganza was imported from the US only two years ago but has captured the imagination of both retailers and shoppers. Visa Europe estimated that more than \u00a3500m would be piled on to its cards during the sale period.\n\nRetail worker Shaun Thompson said he saw a member of staff with a black eye after a disturbance at Tesco in Stretford. The 21-year-old, who went to the store to buy a set of headphones, said about 1,000 people descended on the store. \"People were fighting with each other, fighting over TVs,\" he said. \"I have never seen anything like it in my life. It was quite scary.\"\n\nThere were also disturbances in Scotland, with stores in Glasgow and Dundee closed by police. Officers were also called to Cheshunt, the Hertfordshire town which is home to Tesco's head office, where there were two assaults. A woman in her late 60s sustained a cut to her leg and a woman in her 70s suffered hand injuries.\n\nAsda drafted in 2,000 extra staff, including security guards, to help manage the sale and it said most shoppers had queued in an orderly fashion.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the supermarket said it had rung up 2m sales since 8am, making it the busiest single trading day of the year so far. It sold more than 8,000 TVs in first hour, and more than 10,000 tablets in the first two hours.\n\nSir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester, blamed retailers for the mayhem: \"The events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty.\n\n\"This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. It does not help that this was in the early hours, when police resources are already stretched.\"\n\nIan Hopkins, Greater Manchester deputy chief constable, said the scenes at some Tesco stores were \"akin to mini-riot\", with people trampling on each other. The fallout included three arrests and a shopper with a broken wrist. A security guard was also punched. Hopkins said: \"People need to take a long, hard look at themselves and ask, what on Earth was I doing?\"\n\nHopkins had spoken to Tesco senior executives earlier and told them the events were predictable and the force's \"scarce resources should not be used to bail out stores when they've not planned effectively\".\n\nThe websites of several big retailers including Currys, John Lewis and Tesco struggled to cope with demand on Thursday night and throughoutFriday. At 10pm on Thursday, the Currys website was showing a queue of more than 70,000 people trying to get in, even though special-offer TVs and electrical gadgets were not available until 8am the next day.\n\nJon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said it appeared that the number of people looking for bargains had taken everybody by surprise despite all the preparations. \"From a retail perspective the frenzy of interest has mixed implications,\" he said. \"Take-up on sales today is likely to undermine the potential for purchases later in the Christmas shopping period. The waiting times and overloading of stores is also unlikely to be good for the reputations of the retailers involved.\"\n\nThe number of shoppers on London's Oxford Street was up nearly 20% on last year between 9am and midday, according to the New West End Company.\n\nJohn Lewis said the number of visitors to its website between midnight and 6am was 30% up on Black Friday last year, with most logging on between 12am and 1am in a bid to get the best deals.

Jenkins, Jr. Nov. 28, 2014 6:02 p.m. ET\n\nA resolution by the European Parliament calling for the breakup of Google and other U.S. Web giants is a sad joke, although Google's struggles with European antitrust authorities have been no laughing matter. These battles include the absurd \"right to be forgotten\" mandate as well as rising calls in French and German government ranks for sanctions power to force the \"unbundling\" of the amalgam of applications that a Google or Facebook or Amazon represents.\n\nPeter Thiel , the venture capitalist who has lately taken on a prophetic mien, has warned for months that Washington underestimates the European Union's war on Silicon Valley. Thursday's vote was a confirmation.\n\nENLARGE Reuters\n\nNot that the European Parliament itself isn't a joke, a dumping ground for has-beens and sinecure for wannabes who aren't up for political careers of real substance, which still happen in the sovereign home parliaments of member countries.\n\nAndreas Schwab, the German member who drafted the resolution, is a lawyer who works with a law firm that represents German media interests that have been suing Google, hoping to get paid when their published stories end up in search results.\n\nMr. Schwab's parliamentary colleagues made their own no-brainer calculation (perhaps the only kind many are capable of) when they passed his nonbinding gesture 384 to 174. Local media bosses are appeased at minimum cost. The resolution doesn't actually mention Google, Facebook, Amazon or Apple by name, all influential companies whose favor might be useful one day.\n\nWhat's really ailing the Continent was best indicated by the accompanying rhetoric. Said German member Evelyne Gebhardt : \"European policy makers must directly support European innovation, and particularly new startups, in order to foster their potential.\"\n\nIf this is the quality of understanding on which its economic future depends, Europe might as well start passing out the euthanasia vouchers right now.\n\nThat so many of the Web companies that \"dominate the everyday lives of Europeans,\" as Ms. Gebhardt frets, originate in the U.S. owes exactly nothing to the U.S. government identifying and fostering the potential of startups.\n\nGoogle rightly says competition is only a click away: In its short life, Google has seen much of its potential market clicked away by companies whose arrival was unpredictable, such as Yelp, Twitter , Facebook, WhatsApp and an amazingly reinvented Apple.\n\nContributing next to nothing to this explosion of wealth has been the European Union. Germany and France are the core powers of the EU, the world's No. 4 and 5 economies. Name a single major Web-era success that emerged from either.\n\nLet's amend that: These countries do produce cutting-edge entrepreneurs, engineers and creative talents, who can be found by the thousands in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking of sad and pathetic, even as Europe takes aim at Silicon Valley, apparently dropped from the agenda is what was supposed to be its well-developed antitrust case against Russia's Gazprom .\n\nGazprom is a monopoly of the malign textbook definition, using its pricing power and energy-starvation threats to prevent client countries from developing alternate suppliers. Gazprom's monopoly is detrimental to European consumers in every way, driving up energy prices and driving manufacturing jobs to the U.S. to benefit from cheap shale gas.\n\nNot only is Gazprom an untrustworthy supplier, it's an instrument of Vladimir Putin 's retrograde and militaristic foreign policy. So the European Parliament declares war on Google.\n\nA word about innovation: There is little natural constituency for the future in democratic politics, where, by definition, established voting blocs and donor interests and media alliances are those that represent the past. That's true in foreign policy too. A question has to be asked: Does it make sense for America to be strategically invested in European allies who have so clearly put themselves on an economic, cultural and demographic road to oblivion? It would be sad to write off a continent that has contributed so much to mankind's advancement, but maybe that's what the European Parliament is inviting us to do.", "Nintendo has entered a divisional patent for Game Boy emulation to be utilized in mobile devices, PDAs, in-flight entertainment, PCs, and more. The patent was initially filed back in June and published on November 27th and is a continuation of one filed back in 2000, which also received an update in 2012.\n\nA software emulator for emulating a handheld video game platform such as GAME BOY.RTM., GAME BOY COLOR.RTM. and/or GAME BOY ADVANCE.RTM. on a low-capability target platform (e.g., a seat-back display for airline or train use, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone) uses a number of features and optimizations to provide high quality graphics and sound that nearly duplicates the game playing experience on the native platform. Some exemplary features include use of bit BLITing, graphics character reformatting, modeling of a native platform liquid crystal display controller using a sequential state machine, and selective skipping of frame display updates if the game play falls behind what would occur on the native platform.\n\nCutting through all the legal speak and diagrams, the patent essentially says what you would think it says: Nintendo wants the rights to create video game emulation on a number of digital platforms other than their own. Since the initial patent was written on 2000 and worked on as early as 1999, it also includes comedically outdated devices such as PDAs and even the term \"Game Boy\" itself is no longer relevant as the platform has been almost completely changed to the DS line.\n\nThe obvious modern-day aim for this patent is mobile devices but that does not necessarily mean that Nintendo is about to create their own emulation app. While Nintendo has said in the past they are open to letting other companies use their first-party characters, and they even entertained the idea of utilizing mobile phones as part of their business model, they are not likely to just open the floodgates so quickly.\n\nThere is a much more straightforward use for the patents on mobile devices.\n\nAs it is currently, Apple is usually quick to shut down any emulation apps that they find. Android on the other hand, with its mostly-open ecosystem, allows anything to go that does not break the law. If a software developer creates an app that can play Super Nintendo games, but doesn't include the ROMs to actually play them, that is currently legal. By applying for the patent over the domain of such emulation software, Nintendo would have the legal grounds to go after these developers and either entice gamers to make the jump over to the 3DS and buy classic games from them, or they could create their own app.\n\nAfter an abysmal first couple years of their Wii U sales floundering, 2014 has been a turnaround year for Nintendo. Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros Wii U were both record selling games for the console when they came out, and the company posted a second quarter 2014 that beat analyst estimates. Their handheld gaming division has been going strong for years now as well, so making the jump off their own hardware (something Nintendo has always been reluctant to do) may not be in their best interest.\n\nIf you're interested, the full patent application can be seen at the source link below.

Early Friday morning, the company finally revealed its Black Friday offers, and while they aren't any \"doorbusters,\" there are a few good deals.\n\nThe most notable thing about Apple's Black Friday sales is that with the purchase of devices like the Mac, iPhone, iPad or Beats headphones, the company will be making a donation to the (RED) Global Fund designed to fight AIDS in Africa. The move follows up on Apple's announcement last week that sales from the purchase of 25 of the top selling apps in the company's App Store will be donated directly to (RED) until December 7th.\n\nIf you're looking for deep savings on Apple gear, you're better off looking at other stores such as Staples, Best Buy, Target or Walmart. Apple has traditionally never been a fan of the quick sales usually offered on Black Friday, though this year there are a few nice add-ins in addition to supporting the (RED) charity. The big thing with Apple's Black Friday sales this year is the bundling of $25-$100 (Product)RED iTunes gift cards with purchases of its devices. One of the company's better deals this Black Friday seems to be a $25 gift card with the purchase of an Apple TV, which usually retails for $99.\n\nAs for other products, all Macs, including the MacBook Air and Pro laptops and new iMac with 5K Retina Display, will be getting $100 iTunes gift cards. iPhones (excluding those purchased for $0 on carrier payment plans) and iPads, including the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and new iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3, will be coming with $50 gift cards. And with the exception of the $49 iPod Shuffle, all iPods and Beats headphones will also be coming with $25 iTunes gift cards.\n\nApple's Black Friday deal will be available online or in retail Apple stores, though the gift cards will only be bundled with the purchase of new products and does not appear to be extended to the company's education and certified refurbished sections, both which already feature year-round discounts.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1xRmlxB", "13 CONNECT 41 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. - You're in the market for a laptop as a gift, and wondering about those seemingly too good to be true deals - the $200 and $300 Google Chromebook. Are they worth it for the student in your life?\n\nI've been playing with several models this year, and the answer is an enthusiastic yes.\n\nChromebooks have greatly improved since they first started appearing in 2012, and Google has gone a long way to addressing the negatives.\n\nUSATODAY\n\nHoliday Gift Guide\n\nCompared to tablets - which are generally more expensive - Chromebooks are a better deal.

That meant finding an Internet signal to write e-mail, documents, surf the Web, edit photos and more. Which was fine if you're home, in school, at Starbucks or wherever.\n\nBut that's changing.\n\nGoogle has improved the value proposition, with apps that let you do Gmail and Docs (its answer to Microsoft Office) offline, and even download movies and TV shows from the Google Play store to watch wherever - like on long plane rides with no Internet signal.\n\nThe Chromebooks have very limited hard drive space (the Toshiba has 16 GB, compared to the 500 GB to 1 terabyte found on most Apple and Windows laptops) and all software choices have to come through the Chrome app store.\n\nThe two features that matter to me - editing photos and videos - have been tough with the Chromebook.\n\nThere are simple photo apps that let you crop, change exposure and add Instagram-like filters (I like Pixlr), but they're not the full Photoshop experience I expect.\n\nGood news on that front too. Adobe recently announced a deal with Google to test a Chromebook version of Photoshop for students.\n\nIt's in the early stages, and wasn't available for review, but it's a great move forward.\n\nThe video apps I've used are similar to the bare bones, automatic tools you find in smartphone and tablet apps. You can make simple edits and add graphics, but you can't do the kind of full-featured video editing I like to do in a major program like Apple's Final Cut Pro, or even Adobe's consumer Premiere Elements.\n\nBut you're not here to buy a Chromebook for me.

But many customers are eschewing the best cameras and screens -- and their top-end price tags -- and choosing models that can get the job done at less than a third of the cost.\n\nSales of high-end Samsung and Apple phones remain robust, but demand for budget phones is growing. About a third of the smartphones sold in the U.S. between July and September cost less than $200, up from 18 percent a year ago, according to tech research firm IDC. A top-end phone costs $600 to $700 at full price, before the subsidies some phone companies offer in exchange for committing to two-year service contracts.\n\nNo longer are these cheap smartphones mostly no-frills devices with small screens and slow processors, says Ramon T. Llamas, a research manager for phones at IDC. As the costs of parts drop, phone manufacturers are able to outfit less-expensive models with advanced features once limited to high-end devices.\n\nThese phones lack the latest innovations, such as fingerprint security sensors and heart-rate monitors. They aren't as fast, and their cameras aren't as sharp. But the technology is more than adequate for those who just want to check email, look up sports scores and play video. Many cheaper phones now even offer the fastest wireless speeds on 4G LTE cellular networks, notes Jeff Bradley, senior vice president for devices at AT&T.\n\n\"There's a certain status to carrying an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, as an example, but there are also people who say, 'I want a good, reliable phone, but I'm not willing to spend as much money on that,\" says David Owens, a senior vice president at wireless carrier Sprint Corp.\n\nJoe Liggio, 16, a high school student in New York, says many of his friends have iPhones or Samsung phones, but he's never felt envy carrying his $180 Moto G from Motorola. He says it does everything he needs well, including texting, taking pictures, playing music and accessing the Internet.\n\nBesides the Moto G, Motorola has a $129 Moto E as an alternative to its $500 Moto X. Microsoft Corp.'s Lumia 635 costs $179 or less, compared with the $550 its flagship Lumia Icon retailed for at launch. The Nubia 5S Mini, ZTE Corp.'s most expensive phone, retails for $280 contract-free. ZTE has a few models for just $100.\n\nThe cheaper phone does mean smaller profit. According to IHS iSuppli, ZTE makes about $130 per Nubia device sold, compared with several hundred for Apple and Samsung devices before marketing and administrative costs. But targeting the budget crowd has made ZTE the No. 5 smartphone vendor in the U.S., according to IDC.\n\nWait, you say, $200 is \"cheap?\" Many consumers in the United States see a $200 price tag on a typical high-end phone and think that is what the phone costs. But the phone company actually subsidizes about $450 or so of the total cost and recovers that by charging higher service fees for voice, text and data over the life of a two-year contract. Some carriers are now pushing customers to pay a phone's full price in installments, such as AT&T's Next plan, but $27 a month over two years doesn't sound as bad as $650 all at once.\n\nSo who are the main buyers of these budget phones? The highest demand has been from those with prepaid wireless plans, which are popular among first-time smartphone buyers as well as customers who have poor credit and have to pay the full price of phones up front. But even that is changing.\n\nDoug Kaufman, Sprint's director of device strategy, says that 90 percent of phone sales with traditional contract plans had been for high-end devices, including year-old Apple and Samsung models. That's dipped to roughly 80 percent over the past half-year. Not everyone wants to pay $27 monthly when a lower-end phone can be had for less than $10 a month. And with the rise of family plans, parents are getting cheaper phones for their kids while choosing the latest and the greatest for themselves, he says.\n\nMichael Weaver, an executive at the mobile-messaging firm Waterfall in New York, bought a Motorola Droid Mini for $50 with a contract, compared with $200 upfront for a high-end phone. Others \"feel like they need to buy (something) that can launch the space shuttle, but they don't use half the features,\" he says.", "What do you get when you take one part \"Sherlock,\" one part real-life history, and a bunch of other stuff? \"The Imitation Game,\" of course.\n\nThe new movie, out in select theaters today and starring Benedict Cumberbatch, follows English mathematician and all around smart dude Alan Turing, who played a major part in cracking the Enigma Code during World War II. Morten Tyldum, a relative unknown, directs Cumberbatch along with Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode in the drama.\n\nSo, did Cumberbatch and Co. crack the code? Here's what critics had to say about \"The Imitation Game.\"\n\n\"The film's sexual politics may be musty and retrograde, but in other respects, it is very much a document of the present. There are lines of dialogue that sound either anachronistic or -- it may amount to the same thing -- prophetic. It is thrilling and strange to hear the words \"digital computer\" uttered a half-century before any such thing existed, and when Turing says \"think differently,\" it is impossible not to hear a grammatically fastidious premonition of the once-ubiquitous Apple advertising slogan. Another sentence -- a slightly clumsy invocation of the power of imagination -- is repeated three times and sounds each time as if it had been plagiarized from a TED talk. More fundamentally, \"The Imitation Game\" is a parable of disruption. It not only provides an origin myth for the digital age, but it also projects the ideology of the present back into the past.\" -- A.O. Scott, The New York Times\n\n\"Good as he's been in the past, however, the richness and complexity of Turing's character make this portrayal of an arrogant, difficult, sure-of-himself individual the role of Cumberbatch's career. His performance makes Turing accessible, even palatable, and gives us a sense of how smart, how impossible, yet how finally human was this man whose idea of a compliment was to say, 'That is not an entirely terrible idea.'\" -- Kenneth Turan, L.A. Times\n\n\"Although vaguely positioned as an Oscar-season contender thanks to its stars, its English period setting and its historical and cultural resonance, 'The Imitation Game' is forever doomed to be the other 2014 film about a famous Cambridge professor. I'm not sure it's ultimately a worse movie than the Stephen Hawking biopic 'The Theory of Everything,' but it's much closer to solid, capable British TV drama, and never makes much of a case for itself as a big-screen experience. As middlebrow, medium-impact melodrama goes, you could do worse.\" -- Andrew O'Hehir, Salon\n\n\"But 'The Imitation Game' is most on its game when it primarily sticks to being a John le Carre-lite espionage version of 'Revenge of the Nerds,' beginning in 1939 as it introduces a battleground of the mind that relies on superior intellect rather than bombs to beat the enemy. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum in his English-language debut provides just enough science to explain what is at stake while escalating the beat-the-clock tension involved in the mission conducted by Turing and a handful of other high-IQ cohorts. Alexandre Desplat's hauntingly propulsive score further enhances the suspense while capturing the gravity of the situation.\" -- Susan Wloszczyna, RogerEbert.com", "Today is Black Friday, following Thanksgiving Day in the US, and it is the day of shopaholics.

No one knew who was behind the FES project. But, a report from The Wall Street Journal revealed that Sony is the company behind the E-Paper smartwatch.\n\nCiting a statement by a Sony spokesperson, the WSJ reported that Sony has a project in development called \"Fashion Entertainments,\" where the company tests the E-Paper devices including fashion wearables. The video, embedded below, shows the possible fashion devices that may be in the market soon such as E-Paper based shoes, footwear strips, eye wears and watches.\n\nSony-made crowd funding website for Fashion Entertainments has surpassed its initial goal of $17K (2 million yen in Japan) in its first 3 weeks and now crossed US $23,000 with the support of over 150 backers.\n\nAlthough Sony declined to comment on its release date, FES watch's crowdfunding backers are able to pre-order the device and get it shipped in May 2015 or later.\n\nAttention readers, this E-Ink or E-Paper based watch would be a fashion gadget, and it wouldn't be as smart as the current popular smartwatches like Moto 360, LG G Watch or Apple Watch. But, the customization option would be much better than any other available wearables in the market.\n\nA person involved in the project, said to the WSJ:", "Unfortunately, the Apple Store is practically never the best place to purchase Apple products. It's a fun place to hang out at the mall and check out all the latest gadgets but the prices remain uniformly high all year long, even during the holiday shopping season. If you're looking for the best deal on an iPad Air, iPhone 6 or MacBook Pro, check the big box retailers or online Apple resellers.\n\nHowever, Apple Stores are having a Black Friday sale of sorts by tossing in a free iTunes RED gift card with your purchase. Part of the proceeds from this year's RED cards go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS so even though you're not really saving any money, you'll be contributing to a worthy cause.\n\nBuy a new iPhone at the Apple Store and get a free $50 iTunes RED gift card. No, you don't get a bigger card for buying the humongous iPhone 6+.\n\nBuy any iPad and get a $50 iTunes RED gift card. Yes, you could have gotten that iPad cheaper at Target, Walmart or Best Buy.\n\nBuy a Mac and get a $100 iTunes RED gift card. Yeah, you can find most Macs cheaper right now at MacMall.\n\nBuy an iPod and get $25 iTunes RED gift card. Too bad Apple quit making the Classic that could hold your entire music collection.\n\nBuy an Apple TV and get a $25 iTunes RED gift card. This is actually a decent deal since the big box stores are offering measly discounts of $9-$11 on Apple's streaming TV device, so you might as well buy it from the Apple Store and get the $25 worth of free music, apps and games.\n\nBuy a Beats by Dr. Dre product and a get $25 iTunes RED gift card. Or cruise Amazon for a better price on headphones.\n\nDon't expect anything more exciting for Cyber Monday because Apple traditionally offers small discounts on accessories so things aren't likely to be different this year.", "Enough reports have accumulated for us to say with fair certainty that there will be a larger iPad 'Pro' in the first half of next year, although nothing super concrete has been agreed upon regarding specs.\n\nNow Japanese magazine Mac Fan has published what it claims are schematics for the \"iPad Air Plus,\" but here's to hoping Apple doesn't actually give its rumored 12.2-inch tablet that name.\n\nThe tablet's 12.2-inch LCD display will be allegedly powered by a new A9 processor, which contrasts with other reports saying Apple will use the same A8X in the iPad Air 2. It would make sense for Apple to debut a new, top-of-the-line chip if the larger iPad is indeed pitched as more of a workhorse, laptop-like device.\n\nApple is expected to debut the new iPad around April or June of next year, according to Mac Fan. Reports originally said that a release was planned for this year, but The Wall Street Journal claimed that Apple postponed manufacturing to focus on iPhone 6 demand through the holidays. Whether that last bit is true or not, it's looking like a spring iPad announcement is very likely.\n\nBeyond the iPad Air Plus details (again, that name is ew), Mac Fan says the tablet will look similar to the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Apple is said to be working on an iPad mini 4 with the A8X chip, and Mac Fan believes the third-gen model will be discontinued when that comes out.", "Sometimes quitting turns out to be the right choice. In the case of Atherton's 87 Nora Way, an owner elected partway through the remodel of a ranch home on the half-acre lot to sell to a local development company.\n\n\"When we bought it, our aim was to create an inviting, luxurious space for a family who wants to live in Atherton without spending tens of millions of dollars to do so,\" said Pete Samis, a builder for Silicon Valley Development.\n\nInspiration for the exterior came from an award-winning home in Nevada, Samis said, while the interior embraces an open floor plan with multiple access points to a central courtyard.\n\nStacked Virginia Ledgestone, stucco and cedar converge to craft sleek curb appeal to the western-facing four bedroom. The same type of stacked stones lend continuity to the interior. The earth-toned and rust-hued rocks serve as a surround for the great room's gas fireplace and media center, as well as trim in the adjacent kitchen.\n\nAside from the aforementioned stone accents, 16-foot soffit ceilings, horizontal windows and a massive glass pocket door encompass the great room. The high-tech kitchen revolves around a center island with breakfast bar that includes built-in ovens and a range.\n\nA serene courtyard designed to mute the neighborhood traffic sits beyond the great room's sliding glass doors. Both the master suite and a guest bedroom come with glass pocket doors of their own.\n\nBathrooms tend to be places where builders, designers and architects showcase their style -- and this Atherton home is no different. Curbless walk-in glass showers include trough drains and multiple body sprayers. Thermostatically heated tile floors eliminate a jarring sensation on cold mornings, and floating vanities are topped with quartz counters.\n\nBoth inside and out, the soothing gurgle from water features welcomes meditation and serenity.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Atherton has outpaced the rest of the Bay Area and the most exclusive neighborhoods in Miami and New York to become the most expensive ZIP code in America, according to Forbes.\n\nTwenty-four homes listed this summer had a median price of roughly $9 million, the financial magazine showed. Atherton attracts wealthy buyers not only because of its proximity to the headquarters of Google, Apple and Facebook, but also a permitting process that's generally viewed as less cumbersome than other parts of the Bay Area.\n\nFeatures: A great room with 16-foot soffit ceilings, wall of water and stacked Virginia Ledgestone accents serves as the focal point of this newly built 5,052-square-foot four-bedroom. Three sets of glass pocket doors throughout the home open to a courtyard, and the bathrooms offer floating vanities and thermostatically heated tile floors.", "Friday Wrap #129: High court's Facebook free speech case, Uber app isn't malware, Amazon activism 2014-11-28\n\nPosted on November 28, 2014 2:38 pm by Shel Holtz | Advertising | Brands | Business | Ethics | Facebook | Legal | Marketing | Mobile | Monitoring | Research | Social Media | Twitter\n\nFlickr photo of wrapping a turkey in bacon courtesy of Jennifer MorrowA very Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers; I hope you enjoyed warmth, family, and turkey yesterday. Here's an abbreviated Friday Wrap (since there wasn't much news published yesterday or today); I'll be back with a more complete round-up next week. In the meantime, be sure to follow my link blog to stay on top of all the items I collect, from which I select stories for the Wrap and for my weekly podcast.\n\nNews\n\nFree speech on Facebook goes to the U.S. Supreme Court -- On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that will decide when the First Amendment protects violent posts on social media. Anthony Elonis is facing a 44-month prison sentence for posting threats to his ex-wife on Facebook. While his ex felt like she was being stalked, Elonis is claiming that he's an aspiring rapper who quoted works from Jay-Z, the Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem. \"Art is about pushing limits,\" he wrote; \"I'm willing to go to jail for my constitutional rights.\" The court will determine whether the law under which Elonis was convicted requires proof of subjective intent to threaten, and whether the First Amendment requires a similar standard of proof.

That's what happened to Anthony Noto, Twitter's chief financial officer, when he tweeted, \"I still think we should buy them. He is on y our schedule for De 15 or 16 -- we will need to sell him. i have a plan.\" The errant tweet led to a lot of speculation over the target as well as discussion about the gaffe. If there's a lesson to learn, it's that these things happen. Deal with them and move on.

The concerns that led to the post were the same that had the Internet abuzz with reports of all the horrible things Facebook's Messenger app was doing. Like Messenger, Uber has to use the default permission language written by Google (for Android) and Apple (for iOS). The permissions sound scary, writes The Next Web's Owen Williams, but their uses are legitimate. In an email to readers, Editor-in-Chief Martin Bryant pointed out, \"The real problem here is that tech companies don't describe what they're doing well enough. Super-simple terms and conditions would be better for everyone. I've noticed a growing cynicism from a segment of our readers about every new data-focused app released, both from 'big guys' like Google and Facebook to tiny new startups alike... clearer communication is one step every tech company can take to help maintain the trust of their users.\" I couldn't agree more. Read more\n\nAmazon activism is now a thing -- The Rainforest Action Network (RAN) took to Amazon's review feature to protest against PepsiCo's use of palm oil sourced from the rainforest. In the section of a product page where customers can ask questions, RAN members posted queries like, \"Is Pepsi Co. still destroying forests for palm oil? I can think of more environmentally friendly companies to get drinks from.\" The campaign was launched in an effort to force the food-and-drink company to adopt a palm oil purchasing policy. Based on the visibility the campaign achieved, we can expect others to adopt the technique.

The company removed the app and introduced a new one, which quickly amassed several five-star ratings. When Scott Stratten dug a little deeper, though, he found those reviewing the app were mostly Bell Canada staffers from either the marketing or IT departments. Non-employee reviews weren't so kind. \"Not only is this not ethical,\" Stratten writes, \"it also breaks every review site rule or TOS.\" It's not a practice to emulate.

The Times ran an article on the North Dakota oil boom. The article wasn't kind to oil companies, but it did note that Statoil has an impressive safety record. A Statoil display ad appeared alarmingly close to the paragraph referencing the company. Statoil didn't place the ad there deliberately -- it was placed there coincidentally by the automation process. The opposite is equally possible: your ad appears alongside critical or objectionable commentary.

Other results from the LinkedIn/Wakefield Research study include the fact that employees care more about small successes than major advances. Small successes lead employees to feel better about their jobs, which in turn results in them working harder.

You can count on more such tools for measuring mobile activity will be appearing at a steady clip.

It's not an exact replicy; it says Moto 360 instead of Rolex, but that crown logo is prominent. Watchmakers are getting wise to the fact that hobbyists are creating watchfaces designed to emulate their expensive designs, which users are installing on a variety of smartwatches. Takedown requests are starting to pour in from brands including omega, Panerai, Swatch, and Tissot. According to one report, the watchmakers aren't really worried about the digital replicas, but are obligated to take this step in order to continue taking action against more traditional counterfeits. Read more", "Apple released the much-anticipated numbers that would finally let their customers, and the rest of the world for that matter, just how successful their latest operating system has been. At least in terms of adoption. Adoption rate is something that has always been a major sticking point for Apple since typically most of their devices are eligible for upgrading when an update goes live. Comparatively, there is a bit of a process for Android users that would like to upgrade to the latest operating system. Just ask those who are waiting for Android 5.0 Lollipop right now.\n\nIn October, the adoption rate had seemed to stall just below 50% which began to give a lot of people cause for concern. Apple likes to see their operating systems being adopted, even in older devices. At its peak - iOS 7 had actually crested three-quarter mark hitting a 78% adoption rate. In fact, even at the end of October, the adoption rate was just at just 52%.\n\nThe slow adoption process has to do with a lot of different factors. First, you have to contend with the fact that customers have been driven away by the iOS 8 horror stories that have been heard for the last several months after the initial launch of iOS 8 and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nMust Read: Black Friday Smartphone Deals 2014 from ATT, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile\n\nAnother factor was that many users had to plug their devices in just to update. The update was so large, and required so much space - those with older devices, or devices that simply had a lot of data stored on them - weren't able to download the update over Wi-Fi. After that the iOS 8.0.1 update, which was said to fix all of the mistakes that iOS 8.0 had come with actually turned out to be disastrous, and raised more new issues, than it did correct any outstanding issues.\n\nMust Read: Amazon Black Friday Deals 2014: Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets, TVs and more\n\nApple users though seem to be adopting and getting more comfortable with the new operating system as the bugs have been getting worked out. While some users are still said to have issues with Wi-Fi, and a few other sporadic issues, by and large most of them have been fixed. Apple has even mocked Google to some degree regarding their adoption rates, but the truth is that the two operating systems are very difficult to compare. Apple can almost \"blanket release\" their updated operating systems, while Android updates have to be adopted by individual manufacturers before they can be adopted by users individually.", "Anyone who may wish to purchase a 3DS XL may wish to do so this holiday season, as Nintendo has announced on their official Japanese page that they are ending production of the jumbo sized version of its 3DS handheld system for Japan in the coming months. With the 3DS XL end of life reached in Japan, it puts a time table on the Americas and European territories that have not seen a solid release date yet for the new 3DS and its larger counterpart, the 3DS LL.\n\nThe new 3DS is the fourth iteration of the 3DS console, with the original 3DS, 3DS XL, and the 2DS as the precursors to the new models. The primary additions to the new models, the New 3DS and Ne2 3DS XL, include a new right analog stick dubbed the \"C-Stick,\" two additional trigger buttons, and a more powerful CPU, giving future games the ability to increase their graphical fidelity and gameplay. Functionally, the new system is basically an integration of the circle-pad pro accessory for the current 3DS which added a full size right analog stick rather than a small nub found on the new models. Other additions include built-in NFC communications for the new Amiibo figures, wireless file transfer between PCs, eye tracking for 3D viewing, and auto brightness.\n\nNintendo has a long history of modifying its hand held systems after several years on the market. The original Game Boy that shipped in the iconic gray and purple chassis with the green monochrome screen was later replaced by multicolor case versions. The Game Boy Advance went through two revisions, including the addition of a back-lit display. The next console was the 3DS, which became the biggest hand held console to date in terms of sales, and went through three distinct revisions including the 3DSi XL. While none of the revisions from the previous handheld consoles made strides in raw power, the new 3DS is the first hardware revision that Nintendo has made during a product's life cycle. The 3DS XL reaching the end of life will signify either a much-needed step forward for the company or risk splitting the market and driving down sales even further in a market that is saturated by iOS and Android-based gaming.\n\nThe new 3DS, which the Inquisitr has reported on previously, has been seen as a great step forward by some, and a giant misstep by others. Detractors from the remodel which is bringing the end of life status to the old 3DS XL and 3DS, say it will divide the market again, much as it was during the N64 era with the memory expansion pack required to play certain games. The new 3DS will feature new games with a new cartridge form, preventing them from fitting into the outgoing 3DS XL model. One of the new games already confirmed by Nintendo is a port of the Wii title Xenoblade Chronicles.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, as the saying goes, and the pudding is very good for the new 3DS. According to Nintendo, the new 3DS is the fastest selling remodeled device in the company's history. Almost half a million units have been sold since its October 11 launch in Japan, with 230,000 of those moved in the first 48 hours. The system was released on November 21 for Australia and New Zealand, with a launch date of 2015 for North America and Europe.\n\nWith the 3DS XL reaching its end of life in Japan, it shows that Nintendo is confident that the remodeled handheld will be what it needs to stay relevant in the gamer mind space as the Apple and Android devices continue to increase their market space in North America and Europe. How it will do in the next year? Time will tell.\n\n[Image Source | Nintendo of Japan]", "We all know that desperate feeling of standing alone, motionless, and confused in a bottle shop. You need to take a decent bottle to a dinner party but have no idea what to get. Wouldn't it be magical if a could just read the labels and tell you what's good? Well, yes it would be, and thanks to a new app called Next Glass it is.\n\nI'll be completely honest with you. When I first heard about Next Glass (iOS, Android), it sounded like bullshit. The sounded a little bit like the Netflix and its promise to tell you which movies you'll like. Indeed, the Next Glass recommendation engine does work sort of like Netflix's. The app invites you to rate a seemingly endless supply of beer and wine selections on a four-star scale. Those ratings inform your \"taste profile.\" Armed with this metric, you can then walk into any bottle shop, use your phone's camera to scan the label on a beer or wine bottle, and Next Glass will tell you how likely you are to like it with a fancy augmented reality experience.\n\nI was skeptical, but I spent a week using Next Glass to pick what kind of beer I would buy. It went surprisingly well!\n\nNext Glass is a new app that aims to tell you how much you're going to like a particular kind of beer or wine. Kurt Taylor, founder and CEO of Next Glass, told me the idea came from eating out with friends, suffering through \"one of those novel-sized wine lists,\" and ending up drinking something terrible. It wasn't so much that it was a terrible wine. (The waiter had recommended it because it was his favorite.) That particular wine just wasn't what Kurt and his friends wanted.\n\nEnter science and technology. Taylor decided to chase the demand for a smartphone-driven booze-recommendation engine like any good American entrepreneur would: with algorithms. In order to build the app, Taylor and his team traveled around the country collecting samples of beer and wine from as many local breweries and wineries so that they could analyze the chemical make up of the booze in a lab. (They shipped in lots of products from overseas, too.) Those chemical profiles were then linked together not only based on flavor but also attributes like region of origin and even the type of bottle or cork involved.\n\nThink about it a bit like Netflix or Pandora. Like others do with movies and music recommendations, Next Glass does with booze recommendations. The app collects and analyzes data about the bottles you like, then uses that analysis to predict how much you'll like a new beer or wine. The app also has some built in social features that let you see your friends' scores so that when you are on the way to a dinner party, you could see how your pick would go over.\n\nNow, you and I both know that Netflix and Pandora are not always right. So you can see how I was skeptical when I first tried out the app.\n\nThe first part is easy. When you open up the app to the Explore tab, you're shown a long list of beer or wine -- there's no liquor yet. When you tap through, you see the bottle's rating and have the opportunity to rate it up to four stars. You can also share the bottle with friends and find similar brews.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, I focused on using the app for beer. I've used beer apps before that do anything from an app that works like a Foursquare for beer to an app that works kind of like a Yelp for beer. I can't say any of them ever made my drinking experience better. But if Next Glass could use a little bit of artificial intelligence to tell me how much I'd like a beer I was about to buy, I could get into that.\n\nSo I set up a pseudo-scientific experiment. Over the course of several days, I let Next Glass tell me what to buy. I scanned bottles at the a fancy beer store around the corner from my apartment and the Whole Foods beer store by my office, and I ultimately bought 14 beers I hadn't tried before. Well, one of them I had tried before -- it's actually my favorite beer -- and I thought it would work well as a control in the experiment. (There's not really any scientific value in that thinking, but this beer is kind of hard for me to find, so I just really wanted it.) One was also a cider because Next Glass kept suggesting ciders.\n\nThe scanning part of the process wasn't bad. It was frankly a little funny to be snapping cell phone pictures in the middle of the beer store, but the seemed sort of informative. That said, I had no idea what the score meant. It was just a number, say, 94.2. My plan was to buy anything that scanned at 80.0 or better. I must have an eye for labels because every beer except one scanned higher than my threshold. One scanned with a score of 66.4, but I bought it anyways just to see if it really tasted worse than the others. (It did.)\n\nThe drinking part of the process was fun. I'm a big fan of variety packs, since it's fun to try new things. But the downfall of the variety pack is that you often end up with one or two bum beers. Goofy as it felt at the time, scanning these beers with a smartphone app made me feel like I'd finally built the bum-free variety pack. Every one of these beers tasted great! (Except that 66.4 beer -- which still wasn't bad, to be completely honest.) And I probably wouldn't have bought them without Next Glass.\n\nDid Next Scan lead me to a better drinking experience? Well, yes and no. The app did inspire me into trying new things. And since I had a AI-powered, beer-rating wizard in my pocket, I was confident enough to get adventurous about it. Going to fancy beer stores also sort of made adventurous the only option.\n\nAt first, it seemed easy. I tend to be an IPA drinker, so I tend to gravitate in that direction when I go to buy beer. After I'd found a handful of IPAs (Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA, Parallel 49's Filthy Dirty IPA, Founder's Mosaic Promise and Heavy Seas Loose Cannon), I mixed things up with a pale ale (Heavy Seas Powder Monkey) and a rye (Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye). Then, I realized that I'd need to go for beers I wouldn't normally drink. So I picked up a couple of stouts (Bell's Kalamazoo Stout and Allagash Black) as well as a saison (Brooklyn 1/2 Ale) and a Belgian White (Dogfish Head Namaste). I grabbed two brown ales (Dark Horse Boffo Brown Ale and The Shed's Mountain Ale). Finally, I threw in a wheat ale (Blue Star Great American Wheat Beer) and a cider (Ace Apple Cider).\n\nThey all tasted great. Then again, if you click through those links to the reviews in Beer Advocate, you'll see that all of those beers (and the cider) are all very highly rated. Fancy beer stores tend to carry fancy beers. So it's natural that I liked the fancy beers from the fancy beer stores.\n\nThe trickiest thing about using Next Glass wasn't necessarily finding out if I'd think a beer tasted good. It was finding out how many good-looking beers there are out there. Unfortunately, I've never any of these beers in stores, which Next Glass says is an issue it soon plans on addressing. The company will seen be adding geolocation-based features and plans to work with local liquor stores on inventory-management so that the beers that people want to try will eventually show up in stores near them. Right now, the tangle of distributors and massive beer complicates how craft breweries reach customers. (Just watch Beer Wars.) Next Glass also aims to improve how the industry works.\n\nAt the end of the day, beer and wine can be expensive. Does that mean you need an app to tell you what to buy? Not really. Does it mean that having a little bit of extra data might make you feel better about your purchases? Sure, why not.", "Tokyo: As Samsung Electronics and General Electric make refrigerators that can tell you're out of milk and ovens that can be switched on with a mobile phone, Eva Chen warns such advances may also let hackers into your home.\n\nThe president of Trend Micro, the Tokyo-based developer of security software, said threats from hacking will spread as appliances, cameras and other devices connect to the Internet. She's betting that protection for the so-called Internet of things will be among the main reasons her company will more than double its number of users in three years.\n\n\"You'll feel like you're living in a glass house,\" Chen, 55, said in a recent interview in Tokyo. \"The consumer doesn't even know that their device is hooking up to the Internet and sending all this information out.\"\n\nAs Samsung, GE, Apple and Google are racing to infuse more technology into everyday devices, the potential risks are beginning to emerge. This year, the European Cybercrime Centre warned that Web-connected appliances could lead to new types of targeted attacks, theft and possibly physical injuries.\n\nHousehold hacking\n\nWhile the majority of incidents of hackings into the home have been limited to Web camera intrusions, researchers have found ways to tamper with everything from cars to toilets.\n\nThe market for the Internet of things will probably almost quadruple to $7.1 trillion by 2020, according to IDC. That's enough to lure major tech companies such as Samsung Electronics, which has released remotely-controlled lights and washing machines. Google purchased Nest Labs, a maker of connected thermostats and smoke detectors, earlier this year for $3.2 billion.\n\nMakers of household goods say they're aware of the risks and are taking steps to protect their products. Japan's Toshiba, which makes fridges with internal cameras and remotely-controlled vacuum cleaners, secures its connected appliances through a system that requires encrypted passwords, according to Yuichiro Honda, an official at the company's planning department. Panasonic encrypts all communication to and from connected home appliances, as well as passwords at multiple levels, spokeswoman Chieko Gyobu said.", "Japanese magazine Mac Fan has published some possible schematics depicting the design of the larger-screened \"iPad Pro\" or \"iPad Air Plus\" in its January issue, which have been shared by Mac Otakara [Google Translate] along with some information about the upcoming device.\n\nThe schematics suggest the tablet will include a 12.2-inch LCD display, and it points towards dimensions of 305.31mm x 220.8mm x 7mm, or 12 inches x 8.7 inches x 0.28 inches, which is in line with previous rumors about the larger tablet. Many rumors have suggested a size of 12.9-inches for the larger tablet, but this is the second report from Mac Otakara that has suggested the device will have a 12.2-inch display.\n\nThe \"iPad Pro\" or \"iPad Air Plus\" as Mac Fan calls it, is said to include a new A9 processor that's an upgrade from the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2, which is a bit of a deviation from previous rumors that have indicated the larger-screened tablet will use the same A8X processor introduced in the iPad Air 2.\n\nAlong with an upgraded processor, the tablet is said to have dual top and bottom speakers to allow for improved stereo audio, and design wise, the iPad Pro may look similar to the existing iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini.\n\nMac Fan also believes that Apple is working on an iPad mini 4, which will be equipped with the same A8X processor found in the iPad Air 2 and a thinner design that more closely resembles Apple's latest iPad Air. With the launch of the iPad mini 4, Mac Fan says both the iPad mini and the iPad mini 3 will be discontinued.\n\nAccording to the report, both of these tablets may launch between April and June of 2015, which is in line with previous iPad Pro rumors. Earlier this month, reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the iPad Pro may not enter mass production until the second quarter of 2015, following rumors that Apple had pushed back production to focus its attention on improving iPhone 6 Plus supply.", "A number of years ago, the writer and comic-book artist known as Chip Zdarsky posted something called \"My Marvel Idea Journal\" on his website. Inside this black Moleskine notebook he recorded his off-kilter, slightly demented, and often inappropriate vision of a comic-book universe where Spider-Man abandons crime-fighting to pursue a career in adult films, \"Doctor\" Doom heads back to university to obtain a real doctorate and the Punisher makes love to his firearm. The material was bawdy and immature, yet, frankly, hilarious. Rereading it years later, it is also clearly the work of someone who never, ever, ever imagined he'd work for the largest and most prestigious comic-book publisher in the English-speaking world.\n\n\"There's no way I thought that would happen,\" says the man behind Chip Zdarsky's nom de plume, Steve Murray, sitting in a Toronto coffee shop earlier this week. He (briefly) feared posting the journal might prevent future employment with Marvel, but, he adds, \"This was too funny not to do it.\"\n\nHe did it, and it happened.\n\nLast Friday, Marvel announced that Murray had inked a deal to resurrect Howard the Duck, the much-maligned mallard last seen sipping a martini in a postcredit sequence in the summer blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy. The first issue, illustrated by Joe Quinones, will be published next March. The news caps off a spectacularly successful year for Murray, who has emerged as one of Canada's funniest - and weirdest - voices thanks to the combination of Sex Criminals (his breakout New York Times bestselling comic series), his irreverent and frequently profane Twitter persona, and an atypical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes a stint as an intentionally bad advice columnist, a requited Facebook love affair with Applebee's and a quixotic Toronto mayoral campaign. But Howard the Duck presents an entirely new challenge: Can Murray add punch to a character who's become a punchline?\n\n\"Somebody gave me the weirdest back-handed compliment,\" says Murray. \"'If there's one person I know that sums up Howard the Duck in real life, it's Chip Zdarsky.' Wait a second - Howard's an angry, lonely duck. That's a horrible thing to say about a person!\"\n\nMurray has been reading Howard, a cigar-chomping, wisecracking bird who made his first comics appearance in 1973 and was given his own series in 1976, since he was young. \"Howard the Duck - that was my weird Uncle Fred's comic when I was a kid,\" says Murray. \"I'd go over to his house and he'd have all the issues. ... When I got older he bequeathed them to me.\" He even has a soft spot for the 1986 George Lucas-produced big-screen adaptation that is generally regarded as one of the worst films of the decade. (In his review, the late film critic Gene Siskel asked, \"Who was this stupid film made for?\") So, in a bizarre way, it makes total sense that, earlier this summer, Murray was asked if he had any ideas for Howard the Duck, who hasn't starred in a comic since 2007.\n\n\"I knew Chip could nail the humour aspect, but there's more to the series and character than just being funny,\" writes Wil Moss, his editor at Marvel, in an e-mail. \"A good Howard the Duck series needs to be about an everyman (or everyduck in this case) who can provide kind of a running commentary about the craziness of the modern world as he tumbles through the craziness of the Marvel Universe. I had a feeling Chip might be able to deliver on that.\"\n\nBorn in Edmonton and raised in Barrie, Ont., the 38-year-old Murray spent more than a decade as a cartoonist, columnist and all-around mascot for the National Post while working on his early, self-published comics Prison Funnies and Monster Cops. (Full disclosure: I was Murray's colleague for 7 1/2 years, and my face makes a blink-or-you'll-miss-it appearance in the second issue of Sex Criminals.) He adopted his nom-de-guerre in 2000, borrowing the name \"Zdarsky\" from a friend's ex-girlfriend and choosing \"Chip\" as a nod to Charles Schulz, creator of Peanuts. For years the two personalities remained separate, with Murray, like a superhero shielding his true identity, hiding the fact one was the other. \"I wanted to have a sad-sack cartoonist persona that lives in his mom's basement, paints figurines for money, has restraining orders against him. And that became a character.\" He describes the character as \"an idiot who doesn't know what I'm doing. I've had no success in my life. No matter what, I'm going to mess things up.\"\n\nThe punchline is that as his anti-hero persona, Murray is enjoying more success than at any other point in his career. Sex Criminals, co-created with the writer Matt Fraction, has become a genuine comics phenomenon since launching just 15 months ago at a Toronto sex club. Chronicling the misadventures of a pair of twentysomethings who turn to a life of crime after discovering they can stop time when they orgasm, it was named Time Magazine's best comic of 2013, and earned the pair an Eisner Award - the comics equivalent to an Oscar - for best new series. A movie or TV deal seems like a sure-thing (\"There are definitely announcements coming, but I can't really say anything,\" he says), and Just the Tips, an incredibly filthy and incredibly funny sex guide that grew out of the comic, arrives in stores next week. (The original printer was so disgusted by its content that it refused to produce the book. Sex Criminals was banned by Apple, as well, resulting in an avalanche of media attention.)\n\n\"The thing that we thought would work against us worked for us, which is that there's nothing else quite like it out there,\" says Murray, who's also working on a new sci-fi/fantasy series with Toronto illustrator Kagan McLeod that will debut in April. \"We're just doing a weird sex comedy with a sci-fi twist filled with dirty jokes - that seems like it's destined for failure.\"\n\nInstead, Murray and Fraction found themselves the main attractions at the first ever \"BrimpForum,\" which was held at a Manhattan bar last month. (Fans of the series call themselves \"Brimpers,\" which cannot be explained in this newspaper.)\n\n\"I walked in the door and everyone in the bar turned to look at me,\" he recalls. \"I've never had that feeling before. They were whispering, and talking, and staring at me. And I realized, 'The bar is here to see me.' They had to open up another floor of the bar because it was so crowded. ... It's a responsibility that I'm not used to.\"\n\nMurray now has to reconcile the fact that an alter-ego created for anonymity has made him semi-famous. He seems slightly embarrassed by the attention. A year ago he might show up to a convention and spend more time talking with colleagues than signing for fans; now, he's mobbed by hundreds of admirers. He admits there's a small part of him that misses the days when he had to hustle for attention, and making even a single sale was a big deal. (The first trade paperback of Sex Criminals has sold nearly 75,000 copies.)\n\n\"No matter how inside I get I still feel like I'm an outsider,\" says Murray. \"And I play that up.\"\n\nIn August he chose to forgo Fan Expo, the giant comic-con held in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Instead, he organized Zdarscon, a tongue-in-cheek rival one-man show that took place across the street. \"I could have easily just gone into Fan Expo and made several thousand dollars from being there, but that's not fun and I hate that show,\" Murray explains. Dressed entirely in white, he held court in a red-leather wingback chair outside the Fan Expo venue, a rack of his comics on sale beside him and a six-foot-tall banner bearing his likeness on the other side, shaded by an umbrella held by his manservant, Alex Hoffman, the real-life model for Jon from Sex Criminals.\n\n\"We got rained on. We hit a car. I got heat stroke for like three days afterwards. We made almost no sales.\" He grins and shakes his head, as if he can't believe it happened. \"But it was so fun. So fun!\"\n\n\"I can't talk too much about Chip without inviting him to breach the terms of the restraining order. I will say that he's one of the most gifted illustrators of his generation, a terrific designer and possessed of an almost Andy Kaufman-like scary humour, and I hope dearly that one day he will accept medical help with whatever the hell is living in his brain.\" - Warren Ellis, novelist and comic book writer.\n\n\"Chip Zdarsky is like a gay assassin in a spy movie. Chip Zdarsky is a beautiful dragon that resides inside a crystalline toilet. Chip Zdarsky is like Kafka. Not Franz Kafka. I mean the other Kafka. Chip Zdarsky is the Uncle Dad you never knew you wanted - or needed. Chip Zdarsky is stranger than fiction.\" - Matt Fraction, writer of Sex Criminals.\n\n\"I've known Chip Zdarsky since his goth-cowboy days, and he was a beloved part of my wedding as the stripper at my bachelor party. Deep at his core, Chip Zdarsky is one of the greatest human beings I know, enveloped in a thick muck of his accumulated sin and filth.\" - Christopher Butcher, co-founder and director of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival.\n\n\"When I met Chip, I asked him to draw me a mounted 8-point buck with wieners for antlers. I know Chip is a gentleman because he did not draw me an 8-point buck - he drew me a 10.\" - Marguerite Bennett, comic book writer.", "Today's A/V receivers are more network-connected than ever before, and one of the advantages of that connectivity is the ability to use a smartphone or tablet as a replacement for a standard remote control. Sure, they'll do things like power the system on and off, switch inputs, and adjust volume, but that doesn't even remotely (pun totally intended) begin to describe the full extent of their capabilities.\n\nThe most exciting features of the latest network A/V receiver apps pertain to their ability to control music in multiple zones of your home, and to manage tunes streaming from an Internet music service. In some cases, they let you perform some pretty kick-ass tweaks to your audio and video systems as well. At the most basic level, that includes adjusting balance, EQ, and sound mode. But the latest models go way beyond that.\n\nMost A/V receiver apps work with both iOS and Android platforms, and some add support for other devices, like the Kindle Fire (from which you can access Google Play apps), and even Web-connected computers. Many are compatible with older model receivers - in some cases those dating as far back as five years, though functionality may be limited compared to what you can do with the latest models. Indeed, receiver apps are continuously updated (maybe 2-4 times per year) with added functionality to support new features in the latest receivers.\n\nSo what's out there? Here's an overview of some of the coolest A/V receiver apps and what they can do.\n\nPioneer iControlA/V5 App\n\nFor iOS and Android\n\nWhat sets this app apart? Mainly, it's the really cool interface that makes it fun to use, and fun to learn how to use.\n\nWith Pioneer's iControl AV5 app, up to five people in the home (or five devices) can control a compatible A/V receiver simultaneously. For instance, Mom could be listening to music in the kitchen and controlling playback from her tablet, while Dad is controlling the big game on the TV in the living room.\n\nThere are four modes for audio adjustments: Control, Precision, Emphasis, and Balance. With Balance and Emphasis, you can tilt your smartphone and it will use the accelerometer to adjust the speakers accordingly and find that sweet spot for sound. With Finger EQ, which is part of the Emphasis mode, you can fine-tune sound equalization by sliding your finger up and down over an on-screen graph.\n\nAdditionally, there's a super-fun Sound Explorer option that lets you select from 18 sound adjustments, each of which scatters around the screen in a cute little bubble housing its icon. Not sure which one to use, or what each does? Just click the question mark on the right for information. These range from LFE ATT, which will limit the heaviness of low bass in content where bass is already pretty heavy (maybe you're listening to House or Rap music, perhaps?) to Virtual Depth, which will expand the sound field to reach behind the display, which is particularly useful when watching a 3D flick.\n\nPioneer's really cool interface ... makes it fun to use, and fun to learn how to use.\n\nOn the video side, you can scale content up to 4K from your smartphone, or adjust the levels of noise reduction or color temperature. And you can also control basic functions on compatible Pioneer Blu-ray players through the app, including play, pause, fast forward, and rewind. (This is actually the case with many A/V receiver apps, which can also control other A/V gear from the same brand.)\n\nFor those conscious about the environment (or high energy costs), this app has a special Eco setting that will put the receiver into a less power-hungry mode that uses less energy. You can also program it to shut down if it hasn't been accessed after a predefined period of time (if you, say, fell asleep on the couch and forgot to turn it off.)\n\nMany of Pioneer's latest A/V receivers support HTC Connect, which simplifies the process of wirelessly streaming content from HTC smartphones. They also support Apple AirPlay for streaming content directly from an iOS smartphone or tablet.\n\nOne particularly great thing about this app are the walk-through videos that help users get acquainted with how to use it.\n\nAn issue that's evident with some A/V apps is that they were optimized for a decent-sized smartphone screen. But as we all know, smartphone screens are getting bigger and bigger (and boasting higher resolution) and tablets are more often finding their way into the living room. This means the app can sometimes look ... well, less than appealing on a big tablet. This app has an iPad-optimized version that's specifically built for the tablet's larger screen.\n\nDenon & Marantz Remote App\n\nFor iOS & Android\n\nWhat sets this app apart? The ability to customize the screen to your liking (and specific to your uses). Also, built-in Web control, which means you can control the AVR from a computer via the Web. We also love the simplicity of the app - it's super easy to use\n\nYou can customize the home screen of this app using assignable shortcut buttons, delete inputs you don't use, or make ones you do use often more prominently-displayed on the home screen.\n\nBuilt-in Web control means you can control the AVR from a computer via the Web.\n\nYou can control Internet radio and a connected media server, with the ability to search through libraries and make your own playlists quickly and easily via thumbnail browsing. That's particularly useful if you have thousands of songs on a connected hard drive or computer, for instance, and want to arrange them to be easily accessible for appropriate events (Saturday night party tunes, Sunday night quiet dinner at home, etc.) You can also manage these playlists right from the app, deleting a song, for example, that might conjure up bad memories.\n\nYou can use a cursor button within the app to scroll right and left and up and down through the receiver's menus, following the selections via the receiver's own display.\n\nYou can also use the app to control Marantz mini systems, network audio players, and compatible Blu-ray players (2012 and later models.)\n\nA really cool feature: press the tiny question mark on the bottom right to pull up an overlay legend of what each block of text means, and make changes. It tells you, for example, that you can press and hold on a shortcut button to pull up its menu and edit settings to your liking, including sound mode - choose among options like multi-channel stereo, direct, or Dolby surrounds.\n\nYamaha AV Controller App\n\nFor iOS & Android\n\nWhat sets this app apart? The pinch and pull functions are a cool way to physically manipulate the screen to make the sound follow you around a room. That rates high on the impress-your-friends meter.\n\nYamaha's app works with both iOS and Android, as well as the Kindle Fire, which allows access to Google Play apps.\n\nAlong with the basic audio and video tweaks one can perform with Yamaha equipment, there's also something called DSP Parameter Adjustment. Swipe your finger and pinch in or pull out and the sound within the room will adjust along with your movement. This might be useful if, as often happens at a party, the group starts to congregate in the kitchen instead of the living room, and you want to ensure the music follows along with you. Or if you're a die-hard football fan and want to keep on top of the score even during a quick bathroom break.\n\nAdditionally, you can manually tweak settings like treble and bass, adding extra bass if you want; subwoofer trim; and even adjust dialogue levels. You can choose from a number of predefined settings to auto-adjust based on the content you're listening to or watching. Options range from Roleplaying Game and Music Video, to Drama, Adventure, and Sports.\n\nAs with Pioneer, some Yamaha receivers also boast HTC Connect. And you can control compatible Yamaha Blu-ray players with this app, too.\n\nOnkyo Remote and Integra Remote Apps\n\nOnkyo Remote for iOS & Android / Integra Remote for iOS & Android\n\nWhat sets this app apart? The high quality music streaming capabilities will strike a chord with modern audiophiles looking for the best listening experience possible.\n\nEarlier this month, Onkyo released a firmware update for its mobile app to add support for Spotify Connect with compatible models. In the receiver line, that includes the TX-NR535, TX-NR636, TX-NR737, TX-NR838, TX-NR1030, and TX-NR3030 network models.\n\nWith the upgrade, Spotify Premium subscribers can stream music from a connected smartphone or tablet to the AV system, and make calls from the same device while the music is playing, all without interruption.\n\nA new version of the Onkyo app (version 3) supports streaming music, including, with some models, high-resolution PCM audio (DSD for receivers made in 2013 and later), FLAC, and Apple Lossless. It can also stream lossless and compressed audio from DLNA devices. And with some receiver models, you can even stream music directly from an iPhone or iPod Touch, as well as an Android device.\n\nYou can control music in up to three different zones of the home with this app; and make basic music playback adjustments, like ton and listening modes.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere are plenty more A/V receiver apps out there, but we hope our list will give you the gist of what they can do. Primary advantages include multi-room music listening, the ability to control audio in various zones of a home to suit personal preferences, and even specific location in a room, all in some really cool ways. This might mean getting some upbeat tunes going as soon as you hop out of the shower in the morning, or adjusting sound of the big game so it's still audible while you enjoy a beer with your buds a few feet away on the patio. Playing around with the various audio and video settings can give you a better idea of what your system can (or can't) do.\n\nAnd let's not forget that AVR apps do indeed function as pretty slick back-up remotes, too. Above all else, simply pulling out your phone to turn on the TV, switch channels, and turn up the volume will impress the heck out of your friends and family.", "Best Buy, Target and Walmart Black Friday 2014 deals on iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 3, iPhone 6\n\nThe two are the most recent and the highest selling tablets right now across the world. Though many people didn't believe that these shiny little tablets will be available under deals from different retailers, but the two tabs are available at attractive discounts from several retailing companies.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that the two tablets are value for money. With their impeccable specifications and great design they are going to be a big draw for shoppers who didn't even think that any substantial discount will be available on products from Apple. But while other retailers are offering mouthwatering rebates on these products, Apple either wittingly or unwittingly hasn't got great offers for you. Nonetheless it gives you a $50 iTunes gift card with all iPad versions.\n\nTarget\n\nTarget's offer is also exciting this year. It will open its doors at 6PM on Thanksgiving. Target will be selling 16 GB version of iPad Air 2 with Wi-Fi for just $499 along with a $140 gift card. The 16 GB iPad Air will be yours for as little as $399 along with $100 gift card. This means that it will be yours for just $299.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe biggest retailer not just in the US but across the world Walmart is selling the 16 GB version of iPad Air 2 for just $497 along with $100 Walmart gift card. You can use the gift card to buy anything of your choice pronto.\n\nBest Buy\n\nBest Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m. on thanksgiving day. All versions of iPad Air 2 will get $100 off. iPad Mini 3 price has also been slashed by as much as $75. Besides it also offers rebate on almost all the accessories.\n\nApple Store\n\nCupertino based Apple, the manufacture of iPhones and iPads is not giving much of discounts. It is selling iPad Air 2 for $499, iPad Air for $399, iPad mini 3 for $399, the iPad mini 2 at $299 price. It is offering $50 iTunes Gift Card with all the aforementioned products.\n\niPhone 6\n\nAs far as the top selling handset from Apple is concerned, yhe best offer may not be coming from Walmart, but its offers are significant. One great offer on the most sought after handset this year namely iPhone 6 is coming from Walmart. Walmart is offering you the 16GB iPhone 6 for $179 (with contract) along with a $75 gift card. This means that you get $100 off on a handset that is still selling like hotcake in the market. Walmart is also offering the last iteration of iPhone namely iPhone 5S at $79 (with contract) along with $75 Walmart gift card. This means that you will get hold of the handset at almost free for as little as $3.", "The Toys R Us store on West Waco Drive could serve as an example of the changing trend. Traffic passing the popular retailer would have noticed a line around the building shortly before it opened at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, but at 9 a.m. on Friday, most aisles were occupied by a single shopper or two.\n\n\"I think it's probably like this for most stores that were open on Thanksgiving,\" said Juliet Belen, an assistant manager at Toys R Us, who talked by phone early Friday afternoon. \"When I got here at 6 a.m. there were probably 15 or 20 people in the store, but we've been bombarded the past few hours.\"\n\nShe said retailers, including Toys R Us, have run pre-Black Friday specials for most of the week, and that likely had an impact on Black Friday itself.\n\nAt Kohl's department store in Central Texas Marketplace, assistant manager Maggie Cleveland said Friday, \"I think our crowds today are better than they were on Friday last year, but our Thursday was not as busy. We're making up today for what we didn't get done yesterday.\"\n\nShe said last year's Thanksgiving Day crowd wrapped around the building, while Thursday's merely filled the sidewalk in front of the store.\n\nCarol Favors, 52, and Cheryl Wilson, 42, both of Groesbeck, held sacks from Bealls and Victoria's Secret as they walked Richland Mall about midmorning Friday.\n\n\"It is not as crowded as we thought it would be, and we mentioned that to each othere when we drove up,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe mall and a high percentage of its stores, including all the anchors except Dillard's, had opened on Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We don't shop that day,\" Favors said, with Wilson nodding in agreement. \"That's family time.\"\n\nThe shopping duo said they believe online sales have joined \"Black Thursday\" in reducing the lure of Black Friday, an occasion that historically has motivated eager shoppers to plot strategy as they sorted advertisements and made lists of stores they wanted to hit at specific times to take advantatge of sales and giveaways.\n\nCrowds normally seen only on Black Friday morning are appearing on Thursday night, according to national reports released Friday. The result is a quieter experience on what has traditionally been one of the busiest, and sometimes most chaotic, shopping days of the year.\n\nAshley Slaughter, who manages the Target Greatland store in Waco, was not buying the theory that Thanksgiving openings are hurting Black Friday.\n\n\"We had a crowd wrapped around the building when we opened Thursday, and we are super busy today,\" she said in a brief phone interview.\n\nThe Walmart superstore in Bellmead, like those on Franklin Avenue and on Hewitt Drive in Greater Waco, conducts business 24 hours a day, so the ramifications of staying open or closing on Thanksgiving generally do not apply, said manager Rudy Garcia, who added, \"There is a customer base that would prefer to shop that day and will support it.\"\n\nHe said the store attracted nice crowds on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, with shoppers eager to snap up 32-inch and 50-inch television sets and the Apple iPad Air.\n\nRichland Mall General Manager Kandace Menning said it should surprise no one that opening on Thanksgiving dilutes sales on Black Friday.\n\nAsked if she regrets losing what some might call the tradition of shoppers flocking to the mall and retail strips en masse on the day after Turkey Day, Menning said, \"I'm in retail. If this is what the trend is, we're doing it. For those who think they should not be out shopping on Thanksgiving, they don't have to do it. But I think it is the new norm.\"\n\nShe said the bottom line is how a store performs over the 3 1/2 days that includes a half-day of shopping on Thursday and then Black Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The tablet will also be Christened iPad Air Plus, rather than iPad Pro, the report claims.\n\nScheduled for launch between April and June 2015, the article suggests the tablet will boast a brand new A9 processor, which is an upgrade from the A8X chip sitting within the recently launched iPad Air 2.\n\nAlong with the upgraded processor, the slate will is said to be just 7mm thin and boast dual top and bottom speakers for improved stereo sound. It is also said the iPad Air Plus will mimic the design of the iPad Air 2 and the new iPad mini 3.\n\nThe report also claims Apple is working on a new iPad mini 4 with Retina Display, which may see the retirement of the current iPad mini 3.\n\nWould a larger iPad be in your sights in the New Year?

This is despite the fact that Google's operating system is the top smartphone platform in the U.S. market.\n\nAs more retailers launched their Black Friday sales a day early, shoppers realized they didn't have to leave their house -- or be in front of a computer -- to score a deal. Half of all online shopping on Thursday -- including browsing -- was done on a mobile device.\n\n\"That's pretty dramatic,\" said Henderson, especially since in 2010 that number was just 6.5%. Of actual sales, mobile accounted for 32% of all online purchases Thursday, up from 25.4% last year.\n\nHowever, the desktop PC is still in the deal-seeker's arsenal.

This time, we're hearing the biggest iPad will be called an iPad Air Pro, keeping with a naming scheme Apple introduced with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you might have guessed, it's still rumored to sport a 12-inch screen, basically making it a screen pinched from your MacBook Air (just, you know, hopefully with a better resolution). We're also seeing some leaked schematics that claim to show a product in the works.\n\nSo what do these schematics show? A product with a 12.2-inch LCD screen, and dimensions of 305.31 x 220.8 x 7mm. A new A9 processor is also included, and four speakers are said to adorn the four sides of the device, providing a good audio experience in any orientation. Well, better than one speaker on the bottom of a device, at least.\n\nIt's the latest in a long line of rumors about the iPad Pro/Air Plus. The news is also easily dismissed. The \"schematics\" aren't entirely convincing; neither is the spec sheet. If you asked someone to think really hard about what an iPad Pro should/could realistically deliver, this is what you'd get.\n\nApple has said the larger iPad was a concept, but not really a \"thing\" yet. The device is intriguing, but not one that will likely catch on for most consumers. There's also the sticky issue of tablet shipments slowing, and in the case of the iPad, reversing trend.\n\nDoes a larger iPad refresh the tablet market, or is it too large (and probably too expensive) to make you want one?", "Did you get a great deal on an iPad today? If so, you might want to leave the shrink wrap on until I deliver this news: a larger \"iPad Pro\" will probably come along in the next couple of months to make your new Air 2 look like a child's toy.\n\n9 to 5 Mac reported on this just a little bit ago, getting a hold of what appear to be schematics for an \"iPad Air Plus,\" a 12.2-inch monster of a slate that may finally bridge the gap between the iPad and Mac lines. According to that site, this newer, larger version could launch sometime between April and June of 2015.\n\nThat's not all -- it's being reported that an iPad mini 4 could come out of Cupertino, as well. You might remember Apple pulling something quite similar to this with the iPad 3 and 4 tablets, devices the company confusingly labeled as \"iPad with Retina\" and \"The New iPad,\" respectively.\n\nThe launches of those two products were mere months apart, and buyers of the previous generation model were not pleased.\n\nFor what it's worth, the 12.2-inch iPad could kick off a new line of the tablet, sitting alongside the Air and mini in Apple's lineup. I don't think it's reasonable to be upset if you picked up an iPad Air 2 this year, as it's a great device that got a significant upgrade from the original Air.\n\nIf you bought an iPad mini 3, however, you may have a legitimate reason to complain if Apple decides to roll out a new mini in a couple of months -- especially if that device gets a major spec bump.\n\nWe'll keep you updated as more news becomes available on both the \"iPad Air Plus\" and the rumored mini upgrade.

But none of this should be a surprise if you've been paying attention. Its Snapdragon chips already power most high-end smartphones, so it makes sense for Qualcomm to leverage that experience into chips for wearables, cars, home appliances and more. The company is even eyeing the server market, a move that should have Intel shaking in its hermetically sealed bunny boots.\n\nIt's all a big change for Qualcomm, which started out as more of a background player until it realized it could do a lot more than just power your wireless connection. After beating out Texas Instruments as the world's leading mobile chipset provider in 2007 (according to iSuppli), Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon system-on-a-chip. That wrapped together hardware components like a CPU, GPU and wireless connectivity into a tidy package, making it easier for device makers to drop it into their designs. Its unveiling couldn't be timed any better, as that was also the year Apple unveiled the iPhone and gave the mobile industry a swift kick in the pants. With Snapdragon, Qualcomm ended up having the right solution at just the right time as everyone scrambled to compete with Apple.\n\n\"What we're finding in addition to the [smartphone] market, we're now interested in growing outside the core business into what we call adjacent markets,\" Raj Talluri, Qualcomm's SVP of product, told us. That's a fairly subdued way of framing Qualcomm's journey into entirely new areas, which includes wearables, cars and virtual reality, all of which are looking more like the smartphone market every day. It's not just hubris leading Qualcomm into invading more devices; it's a logical step forward, according to Talluri. \"When we get into new markets, we look at ones that are growing, exciting, with a level of innovation that we can deliver ... That's really at the heart of [what] Qualcomm is really about.\"\n\nQualcomm's Toq smartwatch (above) serves as an example of what's possible with the company's existing technology. Like most health trackers, it can track your steps and other activity. But it's also one of the few devices to include the company's Mirasol display, which gives it an always-on color screen that can last for several days. And it's equipped with Qualcomm's wireless-charging capability, which is slowly making its way to other devices. Samsung, LG and ASUS are already using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 400 in their Android Wear smartwatches, and others are likely to follow. But Qualcomm doesn't yet have anything developed specifically for wearables -- gadget makers are just plugging in the same chip that phones are using.\n\nEven Qualcomm admits it doesn't have much of a plan for wearables yet. \"Right now, we [the tech world] are experimenting with a bunch of concepts [around wearables],\" Qualcomm EVP Cristiano Amon told us. \"We need all of that experimentation to somewhat settle out, then we'll probably think about doing something more specific.\" That wait-and-see approach makes sense. It's tough to figure out how to tackle a new market until there's a clearer sense of what it would look like. But the company also needs to be prepared to jump into new opportunities quickly. Complacency is dangerous. Just ask Intel, which missed out on the mobile chip market entirely and is still trying to find its way in.\n\nBut if you want to get a sense of how Qualcomm will approach wearables, you just need to look at the technology it's developed so far, Talluri says. Its innovations around making phones more power-efficient could eventually help smartwatches last more than just a few hours. And you'll also be able to do a lot more with a smartwatch once it has a cellular modem of its own, rather than being tethered to your smartphone.\n\nThe company is also taking a similar approach to cars (above), a market it's quite familiar with. Its chips already get cars connected to services like OnStar, but now Qualcomm is looking to modernize dashboards and backseat entertainment systems. We're used to touchscreens, apps and seamless connectivity on our phones, so why not our cars? And if the whole self-driving thing actually takes off, we could end up relying on cars in entirely different ways in the future. Qualcomm hasn't announced any partners for its smart-car initiative yet, but Talluri noted that this is one market where progress will be a bit slower. The design cycle for cars typically takes several years, a glacial pace compared to the annual upgrades we see in the gadget world. That's something that could change soon, though, now that carmakers are eager to take advantage of smart-car platforms like Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay.\n\nQualcomm's also played a role in shaping the modern virtual reality renaissance by working with both Oculus VR and Samsung. For the Gear VR, which is powered by a Snapdragon-equipped Galaxy Note 4, it helped Samsung achieve a smooth frame rate of 60 FPS and balance power efficiency, Talluri noted. He also pointed out that VR could also end up being one of the first real justifications for throwing 4K displays into phones. You probably won't be able to tell the difference between a 1080p and 4K phone screen through normal usage, but press that screen up against your eyeballs in a VR headset and all of a sudden those extra pixels don't seem so superfluous after all.\n\nAnd while Qualcomm's foray into server chips won't affect consumers directly, it's still a huge move. For the first time, Qualcomm is entering a market that Intel already dominates. And it'll be a huge boon to server admins eagerly awaiting ARM-based servers, which offer power efficiency over raw computing muscle. That could lead to things like cloud storage prices dropping even further as it becomes cheaper for companies to operate those servers.\n\nBut as it eyes new territory, Qualcomm isn't ignoring the products and markets it's already known for. It's going to continue pushing LTE chipsets as emerging markets, especially China, upgrade from 3G (and, in some cases, even 2G) networks. It's also seeing huge adoption in China for all of its mobile chips, from the low-end to the high-end for upstart manufacturers like Xiaomi. And, of course, it has huge upgrades in the works for the Snapdragon line. (No, I couldn't get any specifics, but one exec mentioned the new chips would sport some \"very disruptive\" features. Your guess is as good as mine.)\n\nAs successful as it has been, it's worth noting Qualcomm didn't even know that its full-throated support for the smartphone market would pay off. \"We weren't sure it was going to be good for the company,\" CEO Steven Mollenkopf said last month at a CommNexus event (check out the full session below). \"Sometimes you have to make bets against yourself to be successful.\" And now, as it eyes the nascent world of wearables and the connectivity of everything, we're seeing the company make similar bets. They won't all pay off -- but if Qualcomm manages to play an essential role in just a few new successful markets, it won't be long until it's truly everywhere.", "Summary: Lenovo is on Samsung's footsteps to promote its products. Recently, a promotional video has been aired to promote the sales of Yoga 3 Pro, while aiming the MacBook Air.\n\nLenovo has become one of Apple's biggest challengers in the personal computer landscape. That being said, a few months ago Lenovo made news when they teamed up with Microsoft to make a video that would take a shot at Apple for their one-dimensional laptops. Once again, Lenovo was at it again this week on the heels of the launch and release of their latest laptop the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro.\n\nIn the video while demonstrating how the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro bends both ways, and can hold many different positions, and essentially function as a tablet - as well as a full-blown laptop - the demonstrator breaks an Apple MacBook Air, while attempting to show the same functionality. Cue up a fleeing associate, who isn't actually an associate at all at the display, the entrance of the \"real employee\" as well as a security guard to really drive home the fear that the unsuspecting bystanders are undoubtedly feeling, and just over two-minutes later - the big reveal happens when they find out they're a part of Lenovo's next advertising campaign.\n\nSamsung is already famous for such cheap promotions. In spite of such promotions, everyone knows what happened with their Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5. Now, Lenovo is on footsteps of Samsung.\n\nWhat's in the computer though? The Yoga 3 Pro is powered by an Intel Core M-5Y70 CPU with a 1.1 GHz processor. Add in an impressive 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of hard drive space and what you're left with is an impressive 2-in-1 when you consider the fact that it is both a laptop and a tablet. If that's not enough, the Yoga Pro 3 also brings a 13.3-inch display, which is an equivalent to the Yoga Pro 2. Perhaps the most impressive physical feature of the device isn't the screen or flexibility, but rather the Intel integrated HD 5300 card that gives the device some serious power when it comes to gaming.\n\nSee Also: LG G3 32GB Smartphone with AT&T/Sprint contract for $0.01 + free shipping\n\nThe Yoga 3 Pro won't falter under extreme use either, with the flexibility that the device has. It has a single-metal band design that basically acts like a strengthened metal watchband. The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro is relatively expensive though compared to other similar devices. It's even more expensive than the MacBook Air, which for an Apple product to win in the price category - really says something - when the company really doesn't dabble in the low-end of anything in the tech space.\n\nSee Also: HTC One M8 for $0.01 with 2-Year Contract at Verizon, AT&T, Sprint + free shipping\n\nThe Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro starts at $1,299 compared to the MacBook Air, which starts well-below the $1,000-mark. All-in-all this is a device that if you're looking for functionality beyond a laptop, or something that can work as a tablet while you're on the run - then this would be a better investment. But, if you're looking for a laptop that focuses on functionality - then this is likely not the device for you.\n\n[Source]", "A new teaser trailer is online for 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'\n\n\"Star Wars\" fans rejoice!\n\nYou can stay home this Black Friday, because your present has already arrived.\n\nA teaser trailer for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" has been released on Apple's website.\n\nThe 88-second video is packed full of your usual \"Star Wars\" imagery; desserts, a light saber, the Millennium Falcon, talk about the light and dark.\n\nThe best part is the robot that looks like a soccer ball.\n\nOriginally, the film was only supposed to be released to a select group of theaters across the country.\n\nEarlier this week, the film's director, JJ Abrams, sent a similar message on Twitter.\n\nTHANKSGIVING pic.twitter.com/46811BgWiF\n\n-- Bad Robot (@bad_robot) November 24, 2014\n\nHowever, Disney decided to release the video on Black Friday.

We post favorite dishes on Facebook, create food blogs, Google obscure and exotic ingredients. Without a doubt, propping my iPad on the kitchen island is a convenient and paperless way to cook.\n\nBut for recipes that are personal and have history, I open my old recipe-card collection. The plastic file box itself is nothing special. Colored index cards are taped with recipes cut out of magazines and newspapers or, more recently, printed from the Internet. The real treasures are those that were written by hand.\n\nIt is a collection not only of recipes but of memories, of people and of places. Snapshots.\n\nIn my own awkward third-grade cursive, a favorite recipe for German Pancakes. Also from childhood: Yogurt-Berry Mousse and Orange Julius.

It was my grandmother's recipe, and I made it only once, on my dad's birthday.\n\nDuring my first trip to France, the homestay \"mother\" (who didn't have any children of her own, but that's beside the point) took me to her mother's house in the hills of Provence one day. Her mother had prepared a fantastic Dijon rabbit for lunch and floating islands for dessert. I'd never seen white meringue swimming in cr\u00e8me anglaise, and it blew my mind. Even though I've lost touch with the host family, the directions for Les Iles Flottantes remain, in blue ink and nearly illegible French handwriting.\n\nHandwriting from a college boyfriend who took it upon himself to copy several recipes for me.

She wrote at the top: \"particularly tasty when unemployed.\"\n\nSome handwriting I no longer recognize, just as the identities elude us of some people in old photographs. Their writing is in my box, these mysteries from my past with whom I shared food and ideas. Who gave me Orange Bran Muffins? Creamed Onions? If only I had written names and dates on all the recipes I've received.\n\nMost of the contributors have died; some simply have drifted off to their own lives. But somehow, seeing their writing and remembering their food, they are still with me. I'm reminded of a quote from the writer and artist Brian Andreas: \". . . It may be the real reason we are here: to love each other, to eat each other's cooking and say it was good.\"\n\nI'm thankful that my old-fashioned recipe box captures these connections to family, friends and to my past self.

But anticipatory customer service is a different ball game, even if it's played in the same stadium. This step beyond satisfactory is where the magic happens, where you bind customers to you and create fierce loyalty and true brand equity.\n\nThink about it this way: No customer has ever exclaimed, ''Yeehaw -- I just had an incredibly satisfactory customer service experience.'' But if your service truly anticipates your customers' desires and wishes, your customers will be well on their way to feeling they can't, or certainly don't want to, live without you. The problem is, this is not an easy type of customer experience to pull off. It requires accomplishing something that is conveyed well in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company's Credo: ''The Ritz-Carlton experience . . . fulfills even the unexpressed wishes and needs of our guests'' [emphasis mine].\n\nApple Store, Suburban Square * \u00a9 Micah Solomon micah@micahsolomon.com\n\nAnticipatory customer service in high-volume retail: The Apple Stores\n\nLet's step away now, though, from the world of luxury hospitality and look at a more hectic and fast-paced setting where anticipatory service nonetheless succeeds in making a difference in the customer experience: the Apple Stores, those uniquely designed, staffed, and organized storefronts that have revolutionized technology retailing (in part by their emulation, by the way, of Ritz-Carlton and other great hospitality organizations).\n\nAnticipatory service at the Apple Store can begin for customers even before they arrive in the flesh. With the Apple Store app, Apple allows a customer to schedule an appointment so the staff will be able to prepare for -- anticipate -- your arrival at the Apple Store and be available for you personally when you arrive.\n\nThe results are benefits for customer and company alike. For the company, the benefit is level scheduling of demand, a Lean process principle. For customers, the app eliminates wait times and promises undivided attention, something hard to find elsewhere in retail. Then it gets even more personal.\n\nEmployees often make a point of ensuring that the arriving customer's name is used without the customer having to reintroduce himself, even by employees who were out of earshot of the initial welcoming of the customer: The first Apple employee who greets the customer discreetly passes along descriptive details, such as articles of clothing, allowing other employees along the line to give a by-name greeting to the incoming customer.\n\nWhether or not you make use of the Apple Store app, the in-store anticipatory customer service starts almost immediately upon entering, delivered by a technologically knowledgeable Apple representative who has the requisite passion for both computing and customer service excellence.\n\nThis employee predominantly listens to you, figures out what you're there for, and personally guides you in the right direction. This type of close listening is a key to anticipating a customer's needs and desires.\n\nIncidentally, if you're there to pilfer, not purchase (I know you're not, but it happens), this employee will likely pick up on that as well; this kind of prescreening makes theft in Apple Stores less likely. (Unfortunately, the streamlined design and unusually open layout of Apple Stores does make them appealing for break-ins and holdups as well.)\n\nAsked such probing follow-up questions as you're moved closer to your actual purchase, you feel heard, known, and understood. The relationship may just have started, but it seems solid and sincere, centered on you the customer, a source of comfort rather than technology induced\n\nOne of the more paradoxical aspects of the Apple Store experience is when this close listening leads to a store employee asking if a different item -- even a less expensive one -- might actually fit you better than the one you originally had in mind. But this doesn't harm Apple's bottom line.\n\nUltimately this counterintuitive approach is highly profitable. Imagine the extent to which product returns are reduced when competent customer service reps -- true professionals -- help you, the customer, by diplomatically challenging your preconceived, or dimly conceived, purchasing methodology until it truly matches your specific needs. And how add-on sales are increased when the level of trust is this high. Extended warrantees no longer feel like obvious rip-off bait but like solid investments. Additional ''one to one'' training for $99? Sign me up!\n\nThe dreaded ''suggestive selling''? Now it's hardly dreaded; it's even welcome -- because the suggestions are anticipatory, they predict what you want before you would know it yourself.When you finally go home, the marketing emails you receive from Apple will be for the kinds of products and services you are actually interested in, because your personal preferences are updated while you visit.\n\nNow, it's time to pay -- and to endure the necessary evil of the exit experience. Ah, but it's not so evil at the Apple Store. The checkout comes to you: Your new retail friend brings a mobile credit card reader to where you are standing and completes the transaction on the spot. Thus, the final impression you have is as warm as the first: You're cared for every step of the way, from cradle to credit card.\n\nMicah Solomon is a customer experience consultant, keynote speaker and a bestselling customer service author, most recently of High-Tech, High-Touch Customer Service", "Throngs of people still camp out awaiting Black Friday doorbuster sales, but it is more for the sake of tradition and sport than for good deals. Those can just as easily be found online.\n\nE-commerce accounts for only 6 percent of total retail spending. But sales made on computers are growing much faster than sales in offline stores -- and sales on mobile phones are growing faster still.\n\nOffline sales this holiday season have been forecast to grow about 4 percent from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Desktop e-commerce sales will grow 13 percent and mobile sales 33 percent, predicted comScore.\n\nAlready, many people use phones to research items, including while shopping in stores, even if they don't make the final purchase on a phone. There has been a spike in mobile shopping on Black Friday, as people in stores find better deals on their phones.\n\nFor consumers, mobile commerce, like other mobile technology, is all about the push toward convenience. It's easier to get in a little shopping while you wait for the cranberries to boil or hide the fact that you are shopping during Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n\"Convenience is what sells here,\" said Norman Sadeh, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and director of its mobile commerce lab. \"These cellphones are with us all the time, so why should you be doing Christmas shopping only at home? Why shouldn't you do it while you're on the subway, waiting for the bus, at the cafe?\"\n\nFor retailers, mobile commerce is the latest example of how consumers' shift to mobile is catching businesses off guard. Retailers risk making the same mistake that other companies have -- failing to keep up with consumers in making mobile shopping as easy as it is on a computer.\n\nTo avoid that, more retailers are building mobile sites and apps. Apple Pay makes easier the biggest hurdle for many mobile shoppers -- entering payment information on a tiny screen. And companies like Google are creating ways for retailers to track whether mobile shopping resulted in an offline sale.\n\nIn recent years, Thanksgiving Day has rivaled Black Friday in retail sales, largely because of the surge in e-commerce. Last year, 21 percent of e-commerce sales on Black Friday were on phones, compared with 17 percent on Cyber Monday, when people were back at their desktop computers, comScore said. That implies that people are shopping on phones at times that they previously might not have shopped at all.\n\nThe ability to shop anytime and anywhere might end up being a bigger threat to offline retailers than e-commerce has been. Just wait until we can also shop from a variety of other connected devices -- like making an impulse buy from the bedroom mirror or asking the fridge to restock itself.", "[MUSIC] If you're shopping for an eccentric tech-loving millionaire for the holidays, you're going to need some help to come up with some ideas that are a breed apart from Roku's and iPhones, and that's where I come in. I'm Donald Bell and this top five I'm counting down a cherry-picked selection of some of our most luxurious tech gifts. Pulled from our holiday tech gift guide and sorted by price. Starting things off at number five, the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+. Affordably priced at $1,400 this drone is equally adept at capturing gorgeous gimbal stabilized HD video from the air [MUSIC] As well as chasing the less fortunate off your lawn. Built in GPS means you can program it with your own flight path around the golf course. At number four, the Audeze LCD-3, quite possibly the best sounding head phones in the world according to our resident audio files Steve Gutenberg. These are hand crafted in the USA and use a unique planar magnetic driver to create their sound. The price is $1,945. You can think of them as beats for billionaires. At number three, a Mac Pro. Apple's top of the line computer starts at $3,000 and it looks like a cremation urn for a supervillain. Pair it with a 4K monitor, and you have a workstation that could satisfy any creative whim you could dream of. Is it overkill? You bet, but what fun is being rich if you can't go over the top? Speaking of overkill, at number two, the TiVo Mega. With 24 terabytes of storage, you'll never have to delete anything off your DVR again. That's enough to hold 4,000 hours of HD video. The price tag is $5,000 but if you think of it as like a $1.25 per hour, it almost sounds reasonable. But when it comes to ostentatious, high tech luxury, one item trumps them all. At number one A gigantic TV. 4K no less. And as you probably already know, that 4K resolution only becomes noticeable on a really big screen. So let's go with a really big tie for first place. At $8,000, our modest option is the unnecessarily curved 78-inch Samsung UN78HU9000. I figure if the size doesn't impress, the curves are there for a secondary WTF factor. But if you really want to see the power of reckless spending in action, try out the Sony 4k short throw projector for a mere $50,000 yu can turn a wall in your mansion into a huge crystal clear 4k tv.

Influential Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi argued against cutting production, a move some OPEC members had advocated to support prices, according to people briefed on his comments to fellow ministers at the oil cartel's meeting. He conceded falling prices will be painful, according to these people, but losing long-term customers to U.S. shale producers would be worse.\n\nMr. Naimi wasn't advocating forcing down prices to run U.S. shale producers out of business, these people said. Indeed, so-called break-even prices for shale production -- the price at which wells remain economic -- varies widely and can be relatively low. But Mr. Naimi warned that if OPEC cuts, non-OPEC crude likely will replace it.

In the 1950s, police in The City of Brotherly Love used the term to describe the horde of shoppers from the suburbs that descended into the city for the days after Thanksgiving, according to Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina. The city promoted big sales and decorations, ahead of the Army/Navy football game on Saturday.\n\n\"It was a double whammy. Traffic cops were required to work 12-hour shifts, no one could take off and people would flood the sidewalks, parking lots and streets. The cops had to deal with it all and coined the term.\"\n\nApple users outspend Android users on 'Black Thursday'\n\nCity merchants also started to use the term to describe the long lines and shopping mayhem at their stores. \"It became this comical reference to downtown Philadelphia following Thanksgiving.\"\n\nHowever, in 1961 there was a push to rebrand the day as \"Big Friday.\"\n\n\"They were worried the negative connotation would keep people from coming to the city,\" said Taylor-Blake, who is also a member American Dialect Society.\n\nClearly, the effort didn't catch on. So now, the retailers have learned to embrace the name, and have even expanded the one-day shopping event into a four-day marathon.\n\nBlack Friday's real deal: Cheap gas\n\nBlack Friday is commonly mistaken for being named after the day retail companies would become profitable for the year. Retailers used to record their losses in red ink and profits in black. \"That's just not the case on where the name came from,\" said Taylor-Blake.\n\nThere's also a more recent myth circulating that the term refers to the days of slavery when slaves were sold at a discount to plantation owners the day after Thanksgiving -- another untruth, said Taylor-Blake.", "While it's not as good as a confirmation from Apple itself, a new report claims that the company will soon stop making new iPhone 5C units by next year. The news comes by way of the Industrial and Commercial Times out of Taiwan (via MacRumors), and follows similar rumors we've heard for months since that handset's debut back in 2013.\n\nAccording to the report, the wind-down will begin by mid-2015 at Apple's Foxconn and Wistron suppliers in China. If true, this isn't much of a surprise, since the iPhone 5C has consistently seen lower adoption rates than that of the 5S, released at the same time last fall. The 5C has somewhat less powerful specs, and comes with a colorful plastic chassis as opposed to the metal chassis of the 5s.\n\nNow that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have hit, there's even less incentive for users to buy the 5C than before. Apple users haven't traditionally had a problem with paying top dollar for the company's best offerings - as such, the 5C never really fit in too well with the rest of Apple's premium products. News of Apple's plans to cut iPhone 5C production started roughly a month after its debut last year, too, so today's news has been a long time coming.\n\nOne good bit of news on it, though: if you were hoping for price cuts to hit the iPhone device line, keep your eyes trained on the 5C sometime next year.

Hackenberg said that the car, probably a sedan, would available \"around 2017.\"\n\nThe Tesla Model S is able to travel nearly 300 miles on a single charge -- roughly triple the range of other pure electric cars -- which has been one of its strongest selling points. An electric Audi with similar range and performance would give the Model S its first real competition.\n\nMeanwhile, BMW -- buoyed by better-than-expected sales of its new iDivision cars, the i3 electric and i8 plug-in hybrid -- is readying an advanced plug-in hybrid system, Power eDrive, to be used in its premium cars, including the 7 series sedan and X series SUVs. The system combines electric motors and gasoline engines to boost horsepower and extend range.\n\nPorsche is rumored to be developing its own all-electric Telsa competitor, a smaller version of the Panamera, which was the first luxury sedan to be offered as a plug-in hybrid model.\n\nWhen asked about the car in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter at the L.A. Auto Show last week, Porsche North America CEO Detlev von Platen denied such a car was in the works, but said that \"we are working on different derivatives [of power trains]\" and that for now the plug-in hybrid engine best suits the company's values.\n\nThe news of Audi's electric sedan came after Tesla announced that its much-delayed Model X crossover SUV would be postponed yet again, to the third quarter of 2015.\n\nTesla may find its monopoly on that market will be short-lived, too. According to Green Car Reports, Audi is developing an electric crossover SUV, the Q8, with a range of 370 miles, that would directly compete with the Model X.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to tighten the rule for regulating ground-level ozone, or smog, a move that regulators hope will spark new technology development to reduce emissions.\n\nThe agency proposed Wednesday to limit the ground-level ozone to 65-70 parts per billion, down from the 75 parts per billion that it set in 2008. It also is asking for public comment on lowering it further to 60 parts per billion, which is a threshold sought by environmental groups.\n\nGround-level ozone comes from the reaction of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds under sunlight. Those chemicals are emitted by power plants, other industrial operations and cars' tailpipes. Smog prompts asthma attacks and lung and heart diseases, leading to premature deaths from those illnesses.\n\nReducing smog will improve Americans' health to the value of $6.3 billion to $13 billion annually in 2025, if the standard is set at 70 parts per billion, according to an EPA estimate. The value will increase to $19 billion to $38 billion for 65 parts per billion. Setting the new range to 65-70 parts per billion could prevent anywhere from 750 to 4,300 premature deaths and 65,000 to 180,000 missed workdays, the EPA added.\n\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy noted during a press conference call the importance of innovation to help keep the country's air clean, and she gave a shout-out to California, which, incidentally, will likely take longer than other states to comply with the new rule.\n\n\"It's sparking new technology, which is increasingly important as we move forward,\" McCarthy said about tightening the smog standard. \"The good news is that California has become a birth place of innovative technology as a result and is providing a lot of opportunities across the U.S. to take advantage of their innovation.\"\n\nCalifornia's topography and large population, which leads to high electricity demand and puts lots of cars on the road, increases the production of smog and traps it, making it difficult to get rid of it. The state has put in stringent air quality standards over the past three decades to regulate emissions, but most residents still face smog levels that pose health risks, said the California Air Resources Board. Drought and heat have worsened the smog over the past year.\n\nCalifornia's air quality problem has certainly inspired new technology development, especially when it's home to Silicon Valley. New sensors and software for collecting and analyzing air quality data have emerged from the labs of tech companies and research institutions in California. Companies such as Intel have been working on sensors for monitoring air quality and managing energy and other resources efficiently, given the growth of the world's population and large cities.\n\nBut we should invest in technology that prevents pollution buildup in the first place. California's mandates for increasing its use of cleaner electricity sources, such as wind and solar, and electric and other low or zero-emission cars, have spawned many tech companies that work on bringing new technologies to the market. Tesla Motors and SolarCity are two examples. But more needs to be done to bring down the smog levels in California and elsewhere.\n\nThe EPA was supposed to set the standard in 2011, but President Obama delayed it when he worried that it would hurt his re-election bid the following year. Environmental groups sued, and a judge ordered the administration to release the proposed standard by December 1 this year.\n\nThe EPA will hold public hearings and then finalize the ozone standard by Oct. 1, 2015.", "You're trying to eat more healthfully, but like many of us, you're also working harder. So what happens when you really need a snack before that late-afternoon staff meeting? Too often, the easiest option is a candy bar from the vending machine in the break room.\n\nBut some companies are ditching that model and finding ways to up the nutritional ante on in-house snacks and meals. In fact, the term \"vending machine\" doesn't always quite work these days.\n\nAt Team One, an ad agency in Los Angeles, there's a refrigerator case and shelves with waters and teas, chia drinks, popcorn, salads, energy bars and other choices. Employees scan their purchases at the \"micro-market\" and pay with a thumbprint that's connected to their credit cards.\n\n\"I think there's definitely a negative connotation to regular vending machines in the corporate atmosphere,\" said Sean Kelly, co-founder and chief executive of H.U.M.A.N. (Helping Unite Mankind and Nutrition). His company, based in Culver City, supplies Team One as well as Tesla Motors and other locations with healthful food for vending machines, micro-markets and snack subscription boxes.\n\nH.U.M.A.N.'s markets are meant to be small, healthful at-work convenience stores, Kelly said. Customers can pick up the food and read the labels before they decide to buy.\n\nIn Chicago, Farmer's Fridge founder Luke Saunders said he was dismayed by the food he was stuck eating when he traveled. It was \"depressing when you have to eat a grab-and-go item.\" Now Farmer's Fridge is bringing healthful, locally sourced food to vending machines and kiosks around that city, including one at the O'Hare airport Marriott. He has plans for salad vending machines in Los Angeles sometime next year.\n\nHealthful vending remains a small fraction -- maybe a few thousand -- of the 2 million vending machines in place around the country, says Nick Yates, founder of Fresh Healthy Vending in San Diego. But, he adds, the demand for more healthful choices in company break rooms and other spots is growing.\n\n\"Once you educate the right person, they get it,\" says Yates, whose products include breakfast sandwiches, dried fruit and nuts, and are sold at a car dealership and a law firm, among other clients.\n\n\"Lots of companies are making small changes,\" says Dr. Norm Campbell, coauthor of a paper in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology that calls for policies to create more healthful options. \"Companies are learning that healthier employees have less absenteeism and greater productivity.\"\n\nIn California, many communities have instituted regulations for what sorts of food and drink can be sold in public places such as parks or courthouses. And what's sold at schools is also governed by federal and local regulations.\n\n\"There definitely has been a shift in the last five years toward putting policies in place,\" says Katherine Bishop, one of the authors of a report on vending machines written for the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. The report found that just 5% of the vended foods on public property were healthful, but more states are beginning to change, Bishop adds.\n\n\"A growing part of our industry is the 'better for you' category,\" says Roni Moore, vice president of marketing for the National Automatic Merchandising Assn.\n\nAt about 16,000 vending sites, she says, there are \"Fit Pick\" stickers on machines and nutrition labels. The next wave, she said, is unattended retail kiosks. Today there are 5,000 such micro-markets nationwide, but it's projected in five years that there will be 35,000.\n\nAmy Mackinnon, director of office services for Team One, says the company pays serious attention to the health of its employees. \"I think things are really shifting. I've seen it even in the seven years I've been here. People are health-conscious, weight-conscious. If we served burgers and fries for lunch, there'd be a lot of frustrated people.\"\n\nInstead, the choices this day in the refrigerated case include grilled chicken with yams; a turkey bowl with brown rice, beans and vegetables; and a Paleo almond chicken dish. Entrees are about $5 to $7, Kind bars are $2.25, Pop Chips are $1.49 and Steaz is $2.09.\n\n\"If you want Doritos, that's fine,\" Mackinnon says, \"but you'll have to supply them yourself.\"", "Taking its lead from Santa, Consumer Reports is keeping track of who's naughty or nice.\n\nIn its fifth annual Naughty & Nice List, CR takes a look at companies' consumer-friendly (or not-so-friendly) policies.\n\nFind the best price on everything you buy on our deals page!\n\nThe Naughty & Nice List \"is neither an endorsement nor a criticism of an overall company,\" CR said.

Wolfe Research's Paul Sankey and team think this is the beginning of the end for oil:\n\nThis is going to be volatile, and we can't understand how that helps the Saudis. Volatility sells Teslas (TSLA). There seemed to be a clear degree of irritation in Saudi oil minister Al-Naimi's comments to the crush of journalists; as ever, he had front run his position: no real cut because as he said, he expects the market \"to stabilise itself eventually\". He is wrong...\n\nWe don't think that global oil demand will significantly react to lower oil prices, and thus we think the market will clear at the point of US supply growth destruction. That will take six months to work through, at which point we will likely hit a significant slowdown in US oil production growth, falling Russian production, deteriorating OPEC member stability - notably in Venezuela, Nigeria, and of course Libya - and rising global demand. So we go low, to storage economics (likely $50/bbl WTI) in Q1 2015 and then squeeze supply. And then we squeeze radically higher. As a result, the world accelerates its move away from oil. The conclusion will be, OPEC, like Rockefeller, ultimately damned itself.\n\nSankey concludes by stating that \"all recommendations under review.\" I assume that means it's time to reshape the spreadsheets, try to capture what will happen to producers like Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and try to come up with reasonable predictions. That won't be easy in a volatile world.\n\nShares of Occidental Petroleum have plunged 7.6% to $79.61 at 10:39 a.m., while Chevron has tumbled 5.3% to $108.98 and Tesla Motors has fallen 2% to $243.58.

SEPA's calling it \"The 51st State Challenge\".\n\nAt the core of this exercise are questions such as:\n\n1. Is it more or less an opportunity to showcase the interests of utilities trying to protect their turf? Or might policies that can benefit all stakeholders, including suppliers and financiers of solar and other distributed energy systems be provided balanced, credible and transparent treatment?\n\n2. What rights to homeowners, small business owners and other organizations have to generate their own electricity and without excessive monthly charges beyond their monthly bills? And how should any excess generation be reflected be treated through improved net metering policies?\n\n3. What rights to utilities have to inhibit or effectively block solar investments that benefit economies where it operates through regulations and legislation?\n\n4. How are the interests of non-solar ratepayers affected? How best to determine if they are hurt financially?\n\n\"Our goal,\" SEPA states, \"is not to identify one outcome but rather to find multiple frameworks that resonate and provide a platform for all stakeholders to participate in our energy future together.\"\n\nIf you look at who is going to be judging the submissions, which are due February 27 starting here, there is reason to believe the submissions will be assessed fairly. Three of the five reviewers - Ron Binz, Susan Tierney and Jigar Shaw -- have staked their careers on cleaner energy businesses and /or policies that are sustainable economic and environmentally. Only one - former Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers - has worked most of his career utilities. See below for brief profiles.\n\nSubmissions, which are to be shared online as soon as all of those meeting the deadline are in and packaged for viewing on the web, are supposed to focus on constructive suggestions without attacking anybody or industry positions. They are to \"allow for continued growth of the solar and DER (distributed energy resources) markets\" while providing for cost recovery without promoting \"any specific product or tool.\"\n\nSEPA also is asking submitters to discuss how their proposals affect \"each stakeholder group\" and to explain the underlying tenets of those proposals for rate structures. Submissions are to use principles of public utility rates widely associated with James C. Bonbright, who co-authored Principles of Public Utility Rates in 1988. The process is open to alternative approaches.\n\nFast forward to the presentation of some visionary ideas: one or more of said ideas could help all stakeholders move forward productively. But in states such as several in the Southeast U.S. where utilities exert a lot of control over electricity policy, e.g. Dominion Virginia Power, will any idea or the process matter?\n\nBob Gibson, Vice President of Education and Communication at SEPA, said in an interview \"We hope it will be taken seriously by them\" referring to Dominion, which is a current member of SEPA.\n\n\"Solar is that bellwether change,\" Gibson said. \"Customers are now getting control over their energy future. That really is forcing attention. We have every reason to hope new ideas will take hold.\"\n\nGibson credited John Sterling, SEPA's Senior Director of Utility Strategy (photo), for jump-starting the idea of a \"clean slate\". The ensuing staff discussion began with: \"What if we offered to bring together the best ideas . . .\"\n\nJohn Sterling, Senior Director of Utility Strategy at the Solar Electric Power Association, is credited with the idea of asking utility stakeholders to submit ideas to better govern solar and distributed energy. Photo from John Sterling's LinkedIn profile.\n\nGibson said SEPA doesn't expect one organization or person will come up with \"The Plan\"; rather SEPA is looking for \"elements of a better plan\" from a variety of submissions. \"Given the realities (of solar's dramatic growth and utility shareholder interests), how can we let the solar market flourish\", Gibson asked.\n\nHere are short profiles of the five reviewers:\n\nRon Binz is utility policy consultant. He was appointed by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission in January 2007 and served until April 2011. As Chairman, Ron led the Colorado PUC in implementing the many policy changes championed by the Governor and the Legislature to bring forward Colorado's \"New Energy Economy.\" Ron meanwhile was an active member of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. President Obama nominated Binz to become chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but following a confirmation hearing in a U.S. Senate committee reflecting opposition to his priorities, he asked the president to withdraw his name from further consideration.\n\nNancy E.

The report was real, but fortunately, the apocalyptic proclamation by the fictionalized Richard Westbrook -- \"The last time there was this much CO2 in the air, the oceans were 80 feet higher than they are now\" -- doesn't mean that today's Earth necessarily will find itself deep underwater in the near future. In fact, by piecing together a series of seemingly unrelated threads, there's a case to be made that 2014 will be remembered as a critical year in the decarbonization of the global economy. Sound unbelievable? Tie these eight stories together and see if the resulting crazy quilt doesn't look like something significant.\n\n1) Oil prices collapse\n\nAt first glance, this is a devastating blow to reducing carbon consumption. When a good becomes less expensive we tend to use more of it -- not less. And the fall in gas prices has already led to an uptick in SUV and truck sales. But a funny thing happened on the way to the F-150: Nissan continues to set records for sales of its all-electric Leaf and Tesla Motors also is having its best year. Sales of fuel-efficient, affordable vehicles like the Honda Fit also continue to rise sharply.\n\nWhile the auto sector produces mixed news, its worth understanding what's leading to the price collapse in the first place. A slowing global economy has reduced demand for oil, which means less is being burned. And the world's fastest-growing producer, the United States, has found most of its new supply from hydraulic fracturing techniques, aka fracking. The same technology that has boosted the oil patch in the U.S. has led to a massive expansion of natural gas supply and usage. In turn, coal is disappearing from the scene in this country. On the twisty road to cleaner, more renewable energy natural gas trumps coal and we only have it thanks to the kind of activity that's crushing oil prices. While those lower prices will make weaning ourselves off of gas-powered cars more challenging, there is hope....\n\n2) The era of the carbon tax may have arrived\n\nFar and away the most straightforward method for reducing carbon emissions is to tax them. But Americans, understandably, are reluctant to accept any additional tax burdens, especially as many are still feeling the effects of the worst recession in generations. If, however, there was a way to make sure any new tax on carbon was offset dollar for dollar elsewhere, the potential of a win-win becomes real. Take for example the tax on hiring new workers that's imposed by Social Security. What if that could be lowered using proceeds from a carbon tax?\n\nBob Inglis, a former South Carolina congressman who favors the idea, told National Geographic he thinks the politics could possibly work. The timing would have to be just right, perhaps after the 2106 presidential election, but the appeal of a broad-based tax cut should be strong. Inglis also thinks there's some real meat here to conservatives. A number of EPA rules could go by the wayside if a mechanism was in place to reduce carbon over time via taxation. Simpler rules equals less government. Ian Adams of the R Street Institute expressed similar sentiments in The Oregonian: \"This could be done while simultaneously complying with the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions in a much less economically destructive way,\" he wrote.\n\nRight now, these conservative voices are just a few, but they make a great deal of sense. With Republicans in firm control of Congress, perhaps their concept of shrinking government will ultimately come around to the ideas of Inglis and Adams.\n\n3) The China syndrome\n\nOne thing that has changed on the political landscape is that it's no longer so easy to claim the U.S. should ignore carbon emissions because, well, China is going to just undo whatever good we can do. The November 9 deal between President's Xi and Obama has been widely criticized, but nevertheless represents a major milestone in getting the world's biggest economies on the record to do something about emissions. And an analysis by Brookings suggests that it's likely China's sincerity is being underestimated.\n\nThere are innumerable details for both parties to work out to reach their respective targets set forth in the deal, but it is important to understand a couple of things about China here. First, the air pollution there is already so severe they quite literally are killing themselves. It's almost implausible to believe they won't live up to the accord given it's a matter of life and death. Second, because of China's command economy, it can achieve successes at a greater rate than the market will in many cases. The latest forecasts call for a tripling of global solar power by decade's end. If China wanted that number to then double every 2 years for the next decade, it alone could make such a result happen.\n\n4) Renewables cheaper than coal, gas, and everything else\n\nFortunately, China likely won't be going it alone, however. Just last week, the New York Times reported utilities were signing contracts to buy power from renewables for less than the cost of electricity from fossil fuels. While some of those deals relied on government subsidies that are expiring and unlikely to be renewed, the most important news was this:\n\nAccording to a study by the investment banking firm Lazard ... natural gas comes at 6.1 cents a kilowatt-hour on the low end and coal at 6.6 cents. Without subsidies, the firm's analysis shows, solar costs about 7.2 cents a kilowatt-hour at the low end, with wind at 3.7 cents.\n\nIn other words, power from the sun is nearly as inexpensive as coal and gas. Power from the wind is less expensive. Of course, both are intermittent and we don't yet have any ability to store enough electricity to rely on them as primary sources. But the price gap would widen if a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system was in place, which is inevitable in some jurisdictions whether the U.S. adopts one or not. And solar promises to get cheaper still as panel efficiency improves, installation gets easier and manufacturing gets cheaper. By the middle of the next decade, solar and wind plus storage costs will compete well with fossil-fuel power across much of the planet, often coming out as the less expensive solution. The idea this would be true is no longer fantasy, it's near certainty.\n\n5) A lone wolf howls in agreement\n\nThe bright future for renewables allows David Crane, the maverick CEO of electric utility NRG, to announce his company will cut its carbon emissions 90% by 2050 and 50% by 2030. To put those numbers in perspective, the U.S. agreed to a 26-28% cut overall in its deal with China. The EPA's goal for CO2 from power plants is a 30% cut by 2030. Crane and NRG plan to blow past those numbers.\n\nCrane told the New York Times: \"The power industry is the biggest part of the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, but it has the potential to be an even bigger part of the solution.\" He's betting big on solar, big on natural gas (see above) as an interim solution, and doesn't want to give up on coal quite yet. To that end, NRG is testing a solution that will capture the CO2 from a coal plant, use it to help extract oil, and then bury it underground. The scheme might not work, but if you're truly committed like Crane, you go all in.\n\n6) The German experiment\n\nThat \"just do it\" approach has characterized the massive effort underway in Germany called the Energiewende, or energy transformation. The Germans want to nearly match NRG on a countrywide basis, getting 80% of their power from renewables by mid-century. While they've got a long way to go, 2014 has been a milestone year. As ThinkProgress reported, one day in May the country reached 74% output from renewables. In the first quarter of the year 27% of all electricity was generated from green power, a ratio twice that of the U.S.\n\nThe Germans are a punching bag for critics who claim this whole endeavor is costing the country too much. And with German insolation (the amount of sun that shines on the country over the year) comparable to Alaska, it might seem the critics are right. But high penetration of solar has led to the lowest installed costs anywhere in the developed world and as a result solar has achieved grid parity in Germany -- it produces power at a comparable cost to fossil fuels when everything is considered. While retail rates for electricity rose to pay for the renewables push, wholesale prices are already falling, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute told Think Progress.\n\nHe adds that consumer rates will soon be falling as the lower wholesale rates get baked into new long-term contracts. It's close enough to a free lunch that German investment in the Energiewende, rather than destroying the economy, will likely make it even more competitive. Bad news for German rivals, but a powerful lesson in myth busting.\n\n7) Speaking of (and to) the Germans\n\nTesla's Elon Musk let on to Der Spiegel (as reported by Reuters) that he had spoken to BMW about collaborating on battery and charging technology. Possible partnerships aren't especially exciting, unless they involve the company pushing electric-vehicle development the most aggressively working with a competitor to advance the technology farther faster. And that's what we see here. Musk in the past spoke of making Tesla's Supercharging network available to other automakers so long as they paid part of the cost of building and operating it. He also told Der Spiegel Tesla would almost certainly build a battery factory in Germany in 5-6 years. Perhaps the second Gigafactory?\n\nRon Baron, a mutual fund manager, appeared on CNBC to suggest these talks are just the beginning. He believes that with battery costs falling, EVs will reach cost parity with gas-powered cars soon enough. And because of that: \"We believe that BMW will likely phase out internal combustion engines over the next 10 years!\" That quote comes from a recent newsletter to investors and a Green Car Reports post. It's possible a decade is far too little time for BMW -- or any automaker -- to make the switch to electric. But it's also possible the transition is going to occur much more quickly than it appears right now, when only about 0.1% of the world's new cars are purely powered by batteries.\n\n8) If anyone is driving those cars, that is\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle involves something called a macrotrend, a large-scale change in the way people go about things. This one appears to be global and generational: People are less interested in owning cars and less interested in driving them. While we might have to wait a while to get a true \"robocar\" that can pick us up anywhere and whisk us to our destination without anyone at the wheel, people are already discovering the next best thing is already here.\n\nThe hints are in a KPMG study, reported in Autoblog, about the decline in two-car households in the U.S. Today, 57% of the 115 million households here have 2 or more vehicles. That's expected to decline to 43% over the next 25 years. If so, KPMG says, the number of cars in the country will actually decline. One of the great climate fears was that someday the Chinese would demand to be more like Americans, with a car for everyone, spewing CO2 and other pollutants. But what if, instead, the two cultures are merging along similar ideals of mobility: More urban and less auto-centric. Vehicle miles traveled has been falling across all age groups but plummeting in the younger demographics:\n\nThere's much more to this story about the decline of autos than can fit in the eighth piece of the puzzle, so I'll revisit it soon. But suffice it to say that we're seeing a worldwide, structural change that has the potential to increase mobility for the average person while decreasing the need to own or drive a car. (Hint: Uber and Lyft have a lot to do with it.)\n\nPut all these together and you have a fascinating picture of global moves toward carbon reduction, especially from unexpected places, and success stories that belie the claims of naysayers. While it wouldn't be accurate to claim there was a strong enough consensus to take immediate action, the possibilities of a sharp turn away from the old CO2 heavy global economy to a much less carbon intensive one seem well within our grasp. Where that leaves sea levels is ultimately a function of just how sharp that turn is, how much of an impact mankind has on the climate, and whether the fictional Mr. Westbrook was right about just how far gone things already are. Still, as Jeff Daniels' Will McAvoy says to him on Newsroom: \"Can you give us a reason to be optimistic?\" You now have eight.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

According to Walker, the network is a \"strong pillar\" to the Tesla set up in any new region, and will offer free charging to customers, bringing the Tesla EVs from 0 to 50 percent charge in 20 minutes.\n\nAlthough the first Tesla Motors vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, hit the road in 2008, the company's arrival in Australia has been a long time coming.\n\nSpeculation about a local launch started mounting late last year when Musk announced that the company was working on a right-hand-drive Model S vehicle, suitable for roads in England and Ireland, as well as Australia, set to be launched by March 2014.\n\nThe Model S was first launched in the US in 2012 and, in May this year, Tesla came through for Australians with sales of the first Model S vehicles for EV enthusiasts in this country.\n\nThe Model S is available in four iterations: the 60 (60kWh battery), the 85 (85kWh battery), the 85D (D standing for dual motor model) and the \"performance\" P85D model (85kWh battery). In Australia, prices for car only start at AU$91,400 for the 60 model, AU$103,400 for the 85 model, AU$109,500 for the 85D, and AU$133,500 for the P85D model -- with additional features such as Smart Air Suspension and premium interiors available as optional extras, plus on-road costs and taxes.\n\nUpdated at 2:07 p.m. AEDT to correct pricing and add further details on dual motor models.\n\nRelated Stories 2014 Tesla Model S review Australian sales open for Tesla Model S Tesla Motors announces right-hand-drive Model S"]}, "Airbus": {"2014-11-28": ["A European satellite beamed images to earth using new laser-based communications technology on Friday, opening the way for uninterrupted and near instantaneous viewing of natural disasters being sent to governments and relief agencies.\n\nThe images were a test of a 450 million euro ($562 million) space data highway being constructed.

The contract was signed in Berlin, Germany and is worth about 390 million euros.\n\nOrion, under development by NASA, is the space capsule designed to carry astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit aboard NASA's Space Launch System (SLS). The vehicle is comprised of the service module, the crew module and the launch abort system, with an aim to carry humans to the Moon, to asteroids, and to Mars.\n\nThe service module's purpose is to propel and power the spacecraft and to provide thermal control, water and air for the crew. It can be disposed after each mission, and is designed to be released from the crew module just before the capsule returns to Earth.\n\nNASA and ESA had agreed in December 2012 that a European service module would power the Orion spacecraft, and that it would be based on the design and experience of the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) that Airbus developed and built, on ESA's behalf. The ATV was designed as an expendable spacecraft to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) and, as needed, boost the station's orbit as its orbit decays. The fifth and final ATV launch occurred in July of this year.\n\nThough the European space program was significant in the development of Spacelab, a laboratory that was used on many Space Shuttle missions, this is the first time NASA has allowed a European module to power a spacecraft crewed by American astronauts. According to Airbus, this is the first time Europe has been involved in providing system-critical elements for an American space project at all.\n\n\"Let me be very clear - if Europe had not done ATV, the US would not have invited Europe to do the service module for them,\" said Bart Reijnen, the head of orbital systems and space exploration at Airbus Defence and Space. \"If we had not done ATV, we would have started with a much lower technology readiness level, which would have meant spending more money and taking a longer schedule.\"\n\nFran\u00e7ois Auque, Airbus' Head of Space Systems, stated, \"This follow-on contract is a mark of confidence in our expertise as well as in our ability to deliver reliable state-of-the-art space systems on time and within budget. Thanks to this program and the continuous investments we make, we are able to maintain our technological lead. In the wake of the ATV's outstanding five flawless missions to the ISS, this program is yet another example of the important role that Europe plays globally in the field of human space flight.\"\n\nESA approved the system designs for the service module in May of 2014, which began the detailed definition phase. This phase is scheduled to be completed a year from now, in November 2015, when the detailed design is approved by ESA. After that point, the qualification and production phases will occur.\n\nThe price tag on the new spacecraft will be essentially zero, as a barter agreement has been arranged. In exchange for the European-built service module, NASA will cover the costs Europe will incur at the ISS between 2018 and 2020. This type of arrangement is commonplace, and as the station should be operational into the decade, we may see more arrangements for future service modules.\n\nExploration Mission 1, currently planned for 2017/2018, will be the first Orion mission with European involvement. The goal is an unmanned flight to the Lagrangian points of the Moon and a successful return to Earth, with an aim of demonstrating the spacecraft's abilities before adding any crew as well as qualifying for NASA's SLS rocket. Exploration Mission 2 is scheduled for no earlier than 2020, and is planned to be the first crewed mission of Orion.\n\n\"It is of course my wish to have a European astronaut - a man or a woman - onboard the Orion capsule sometime in the next decade,\" said Thomas Reiter, ESA's human spaceflight director. \"I don't think it is too far-fetched to believe that with this path we have now opened, we will get flight opportunities.\"\n\nNext week, on Thursday Dec. 4, we will see a test version of the service module, along with the crew module lift off from Cape Canaveral as part of a test flight. Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), will lift off from Space Launch Complex 37 (SLC 37) atop a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy at 7:05 a.m. EST (1205 GMT). The test flight is expected to last just over four hours and will test key systems on the vehicle, including the launch abort system (LAS), heat shield, and parachutes.", "FRANKFURT - A European satellite beamed images to earth using new laser-based communications technology on Friday, opening the way for uninterrupted and near instantaneous viewing of natural disasters being sent to governments and relief agencies.\n\nThe images were a test of a 450 million euro ($562 million) space data highway being constructed.

It's Etihad Airways' first 787 Dreamliner, parked outside Boeing's (BA) plant in Everett, Wash., and an object of desire among plane spotters for a new, secrecy-shrouded paint scheme.\n\nIllustration by Steph Davidson\n\nLeighton is angling for Internet fame as he stalks the 787, already one of the most-chronicled industrial products on the planet for its futuristic design and troubled start. Selling the first aerial shot of the shimmering silver-and-gold Etihad plane to fan sites or a trade publication could also more than cover the cost of his $500 copter ride.\n\n\"I'd say there's monetary reward, but not really,\" says the 27-year-old Leighton. \"It's mostly about pride, about keeping my streak going.\"\n\nIn almost five years of semiprofessional plane spotting, Leighton has snapped more than 35,000 photos and garnered at least 7 million Internet views. He's among the growing ranks of \"avgeeks,\" people who gather and share images of aircraft with the zeal displayed by enthusiasts pursuing rare comic books or baseball cards.\n\nTheir passion creates opportunities as well as challenges for Boeing. Constant exposure in fans' pictures means the world's largest planemaker must play hide-and-seek with new commercial projects. Photos also can signal a factory hiccup, as when a buildup of undelivered jets outside Boeing plants preceded the disclosure of hairline wing cracks on some 787s in March.\n\nIf Airbus (AIR:FP) wants to see the latest from its U.S. rival, it can rely on photo stalkers around Boeing's plant and neighboring Paine Field in Everett. They will climb trees or fences to eyeball newly assembled aircraft under tow to the paint shop to get their livery, as an airline's markings are known. In 2011, Boeing swathed the first passenger 747-8 jumbo in paper to thwart peeping eyes. \"When your factory, paint hangars, and delivery center sit directly adjacent to a public airport, keeping a customer's livery a surprise is next to impossible,\" says Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman.\n\nThose documenting Boeing's factory output are a subset of enthusiasts -- mostly male -- who feel compelled to meticulously track heavy machinery from locomotives to steel mills, says George Hamlin, a former Airbus executive who's now an aviation consultant.\n\nHamlin was captivated by Boeing's humpbacked 747 jumbo in the late 1960s. Then, he says, \"there were few if any spotters or photographers.\" Over the decades Hamlin has amassed more than 20,000 slides of aircraft and another 8,000 or so digital shots. He's watched the ranks of jet enthusiasts swell with the advent of the Internet.\n\n\"It's a labor of love. I'd like to keep this information as current as possible for as long as possible, until they stop building it.\"\n\nBoeing has gone from ignoring avgeeks to courting them. The Future of Flight Aviation Center near the Everett plant is a magnet for plane fans, drawing 270,000 visitors a year. Shutterbugs flock to an observation deck overlooking a Paine Field runway where Boeing test pilots put widebodies through their paces. Boeing also opens up its doors for Aviation Geek Fest, an annual gathering that includes a chance to wander the Everett factory, the world's largest building by volume, according to Sandy Ward, the center's marketing director. Tickets sold out in three minutes for this year's event. \"We'll have people sitting around the world -- it might be midnight in Shanghai -- hitting refresh, refresh,\" Ward says. \"You'll have virtual fistfights breaking out.\"\n\nBoeing's involvement reflects a shift in its marketing, from ignoring the avgeeks to inviting bloggers to aircraft unveilings and events once reserved for credentialed reporters. \"Aviation Geek Fest is an opportunity for Boeing to embrace people with a passion for airplanes,\" Boeing's Alder says. \"Events like these connect us with an enthusiastic audience for our products in ways that wouldn't have been possible a few years ago.\"\n\nFor plane spotters, the Dreamliner continues to inspire a photo fascination so intense that fans recently vied for snapshots of the scarlet engine nacelles (the housing visible under the wing) on a Virgin Atlantic 787.\n\nThe attention is \"an accidental Boeing creation,\" says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at consultant Teal Group. Boeing's first all-new aircraft of the 21st century, the Dreamliner fired imaginations with its plastic-composite hull, then grabbed headlines as supply-chain snarls delayed the initial delivery by three years, to 2011. It was the first jet whose development played out on Twitter (TWTR), and it became a focus of posts by amateur blogger Jon Ostrower, now a Wall Street Journal reporter.\n\nMany of those who tuned in for the early Dreamliner drama have stuck around, says David Parker Brown, who founded airlinereporter.com in 2008. He was inspired by Ostrower's social media success, as was Uresh Sheth, a Wall Street banker who writes the All Things787 blog.\n\nIn his spare time, Sheth compiles tables tracking the progress of every 787 assembled and delivered. Sheth says he relies on tidbits shared by \"volunteers,\" not leaked internal Boeing documents. He cross-checks each data point, often by looking up photos from Dreamliner followers at Boeing's factories in Washington and South Carolina. \"It's a labor of love,\" Sheth says. \"I'd like to keep this information as current as possible for as long as possible, until they stop building it.\" It's no easy task. Through Nov. 5, Boeing had handed over 204 Dreamliners -- and had a backlog of 850 more.\n\nSpotters also regularly camp out around Airbus's factory complex and adjoining Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France. Competition was especially fierce earlier this year when Airbus pilots were running braking and take-off tests for the new A350 widebody jet, a Dreamliner rival set to make its commercial debut in December. Fans were eager to win bragging rights by snapping photos and tweeting ahead of Airbus's official dispatches. \"It's not that there's anything sensitive, but when the images appear privately, that takes the surprise from our own photo release,\" says Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon. Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), the No.\u20094 planemaker, restricts photography at its main factory at S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, which is within a closed compound.\n\nAs an infant, plane spotter Leighton lived under an approach flight path to St. John's International Airport, in Newfoundland. At 18, he began haunting the forums on Airliners.net; gradually he got the nerve to post his own photos. Now he's motivated by friendly rivalry to land \"the first of anything,\" from shots of a new model to a new livery, he says. His specialty: early aerial perspectives of these jets. A day job with flexible hours -- Leighton declines to name his profession -- pays for his plane-spotting habit.\n\nUsing Sheth's production charts, Leighton monitored the Etihad 787's progress at the factory over the summer. His interest grew as word leaked that the jet would feature an edgier look, part of a branding makeover for the Abu Dhabi-based carrier. Etihad heard the buzz about its new livery and hosted a special nighttime unveiling in a live Webcast in late September to thwart plane spotters.\n\nThat still left a photographic \"first\" -- an overhead shot -- to be claimed by Leighton. So he found himself in a four-seat Robinson R44 helicopter clattering toward the Boeing plant on the first sunny day after the Etihad fete.\n\nAs pilot Daiichi Takeuchi maneuvered into place about 900 feet over the field, Leighton steadied his camera and went to work. He was done 35 seconds later. His photo of the jet's abstract desert-themed paint job has been viewed more than 36,000 times on Airliners.net and drawn more than 5,400 \"likes\" in postings on AirlineReporter and Etihad's Facebook (FB) page. \"No one breaks even,\" Leighton says. \"We do this regardless.\"", "(Terry Maxon/DMN)Virgin Group founder Richard Branson greets the crowd as Virgin America begins service Oct. 13, 2014, at Dallas Love Field. Behind him is Virgin America chairman Donald J. Carty and, behind Carty, CEO David Cush.\n\nWe can call this an incomplete grade. But airlines at Dallas Love Field hauled 13 percent more passengers last month than they did in October 2013.\n\nThe reason for the increase, obviously, is the Oct. 13 expiration of the Wright amendment and the addition of more flights out of the Dallas airport to more distant cities.\n\nNumbers from the Dallas Department of Aviation show that 863,771 passengers got on and off airline flights at Love Field last month, up 13.1 percent and nearly 100,000 from the 763,854 that flew in and out of Love a year earlier.\n\nThe number of flights increased less than that - to 8,298 in 2014 from 7,574 in October 2013, up 9.6 percent.\n\nBut the bias was more to bigger airplanes.

Virgin America began flying its Airbus jets, which range in size from 119 seats to 149 seats, with most Dallas flights so far on the 119-seat Airbus A319.\n\nSouthwest Airlines boosted its traffic by 8.7 percent, from 736,962 passengers in October 2013 to 801,445 passengers in October 2014. Even so, its market share dropped 3.7 percentage points, from 96.5 percent of all passengers carried to 92.8 percent.\n\nWe called it an incomplete grade because the airport flying didn't expand until Oct. 13, and airlines kept adding flights after that.\n\nVirgin America, which began with nine departures to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., added four New York flights on Oct. 28.\n\nSouthwest Airlines launched flights to seven cities on Oct. 13, but didn't add the next eight cities until Nov. 2.\n\nSo November should give us a better picture of how the airlines are doing with their newly acquired freedom.", "PARIS: Airbus Group has a state of less than 10 percent of planemaker Dassault Aviation back to the French planemaker, starting the process of unwinding its 46.3 percent holding, Le Monde newspaper reported on Friday.\n\nAirbus declined to comment.

Steinmeier stressed, however, that the specially-adapted Airbus A340-300 \"Robert Koch\" guaranteed medical care under \"optimal conditions.\"\n\nThe machine is nearly 64 meters (210 feet) long, and its passenger seats and the rest of the cabin interior were removed and replaced by a \"patient transportation isolation unit.\"\n\nInside the specially-built airtight tent, an Ebola patient can be cared for to the same extent as in intensive care at hospital, without pathogens escaping and endangering the rest of the crew. The aircraft can also accommodate up to 19 attendants, including technicians for special equipment, officials and doctors.\n\nLufthansa said that more than 700 pilots and flight attendants have volunteered to work as crew aboard the Ebola Airbus.\n\n\"It's probably the one Lufthansa aircraft that we hope to rarely see used,\" said Steinmeier.\n\n'Ecouraging' clinical trials\n\nAlso on Thursday, Ebola vaccine researchers said that they were \"encouraged\" by the results of an initial clinical trial, in which volunteers developed antibodies needed to fight the virus.

Back in the early 1960s, Britain became third country to send an object into orbit in the shape of the Ariel 1 satellite, built and launched in collaboration with the US.\n\nAnd even today, relatively few people are aware of the relative strength of Britain's space industry. As things stand the sector generates about \u00a39bn for the UK economy and directly supports around 29,000. jobs. And if the government's plans and projections come to fruition it should be worth \u00a3400bn by 2040.\n\nHardly surprising then that Britain's Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) has cited 'space' in a new report that seeks to map out the six engineering and technology-led sectors that are likely to have the biggest positive impact on the UK economy in the coming years and decades.\n\nDubbed Ones to Watch, the report identifies Robotics (and autonomous systems), Additive Manufacturing ( aka 3D printing), smart power networks, cyber security and food security along with space as key industries that will solve some of world's big problems. And in addressing global demand, the sectors will be key not only to generating wealth while also maintaining a thriving domestic industrial base offering well-paid jobs for engineers and technologists.\n\nOpportunities for Entrepreneurs\n\nAnd these are sectors where are real opportunities for high-tech start-ups as well as industrial giants. Even in an area such as space research, which on the face of it is dominated by big players such as Airbus Defence and Space, there is room for small, innovative companies to develop tomorrow's technologies and materials. For instance, as the report points out, the area around Harwell in Oxfordshire has established itself as a space cluster and there government support for entrepreneurial companies working in the sector.\n\nThe opportunities for technology-led start-ups are arguably even more apparent in some of the other sectors named by the report. To take a couple of examples, Cyber-security is becoming ever-more crucial, particularly in ensuring that the new generation of network-enabled control systems in sites such as power stations, factories and military installations are protected . Similarly, as the \"internet of things\" moves from concept to reality, security concerns are coming to the fore - witness the minor scandal over Russian hackers watching UK citizens through net-enabled baby cameras. There are currently around 600 security firms in the UK, many of the clustered in the Malvern Hills area, which has become a centre for entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nSimilarly, the UK is strong on robotics and autonomous systems research and government funding has been made available to help startup companies make the journey from the lab to the marketplace.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "An aerospace centre that will house the last Concorde to fly has been awarded a \u00a34.7m Heritage Lottery Fund grant.\n\nThe planned \u00a316m centre, at the former Filton airfield in Bristol, will mark the city's aerospace heritage and be a permanent home for Concorde 216.\n\nConcorde 216 - or Alpha Foxtrot - has been in the care of Airbus UK since it was withdrawn from service in 2003.\n\nMark Stewart, from Airbus, said \"It is great news - we look forward to being able to move Concorde under cover.\"\n\nThe jet has been at Filton since 2003 but was closed to the public in October 2010 for maintenance.\n\nA 9.5-acre site at Filton has been earmarked for the new centre by Bristol Aero Collection Trust, which is behind the project.\n\nDue to open in 2017, it will boast an industrial museum, interactive galleries and a \"major new building\" to present Concorde 216 in an \"exciting and dynamic way\".\n\n\"Concorde was largely designed and built at Filton, with the first British flight taking off in 1969 and the final supersonic flight of any Concorde in the world landing at the airfield on 26 November 2003,\" said Iain Gray, chair of the trust.\n\n\"This grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund is a great anniversary present for this icon of British design and innovation.\"\n\nThe trust said it had also received \"significant pledged support\" from BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and South Gloucestershire Council.\n\nHoward Mason, from BAE Systems, said the company \"remain committed to the success of the project\".\n\n\"The Bristol site is a key component in the history of BAE Systems and we are very happy that the trust will protect and exploit the historical material from the site in telling the story of bold aerospace innovation in Bristol over the last century,\" he said.", "Historic trade facilitation deal struck at WTO after consensus on food security\n\nIndia will soon have a nationwide air ambulance service which could turn out to be affordable for common people with a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 or an insurance cover.\n\nHelicopter emergency medical service (HEMS), which is common in developed countries, is expected to kick off in India in the last quarter of 2015, with three companies -- Aviators Air Rescue Pvt Ltd, an Indian operator, Air Medical Group Holdings Inc, an air medical provider in the US and Airbus Helicopters -- signing a tripartitie agreement.\n\nTo start with, the proposed HEMS will begin operations from South India, using three Airbus Helicopters-built EC135 T3/P3 helicopters operated by Aviators. \"More such helicopters are expected to be phased in during 2016 for expanded nationwide coverage. We expect to cover the entire country within three years as we are adding at least even helicopters per year,\" said Arun Sharma, managing director of Aviators Air Rescue.\n\n\"This service will be affordable to a person drawing a monthly salary of Rs 15,000-20,000. It's very affordable and we are putting our final touches to the numbers,\" Sharma told The Indian Express. \"Each helicopter will be operated by two pilots and two medical crew. This service will be available nationwide with at least one helicopter covering the state,\" he said.\n\nSharma said the company is in discussions with insurance companies to make it affordable to common people. \"There will be a premium to avail such a service. The service is affordable without insurance in its current offering,\" Sharma said.\n\nHe said in this first phase, there will be seven helicopters with a total investment of approximately $60 million. \"We will tie up with hospitals and discussions are in the final stages,\" he said.\n\nWhat can really make the HEMS popular and affordable will be the availability of insurance coverage for using such facilities. \"One simple possibility is to give such emergency cover add-on cover to health and PA policies. The add-on cover is possible with life insurance policies. Yes, there will be extra premium for the add-on cover but it may not be significant,\" said former IRDA Member (life) KK Srinivasan.\n\nThe project has selected EC135 T3/P3 helicopter made by Airbus. \"With the support of Airbus Helicopters and Air Medical Group Holdings which are leaders in their respective fields, Aviators will provide top-notch air medical services,\" Sharma said.", "The Eutelsat-9B satellite with its EDRS-A payload is shown in the anechoic test chamber of Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, France, having completed its final antenna pattern tests today.\n\nEDRS-A is a hosted package as the first of two nodes of the European Data Relay System set to be launched next year.\n\nAlso known as Europe's SpaceDataHighway, EDRS will use cutting-edge laser technology to capture and relay information gathered by Earth-observing satellites.

Its deal to buy 250 single-aisle planes from Airbus for $26 billion, with an option to buy 100 more, is significant for Indian aviation and for India's ability to impact global growth. The deal, on top of its firm orders for 100 current-generation A320s and 180 A320neos, also shows the high level of ambition that Indian companies are now displaying. Becoming global players, and achieving scale, will increase the impact that Indian companies have in the world market.\n\nIndia, the ninth-largest aviation market, is projected to be one of the five fastest-growing markets by 2034. IndiGo's deal only underscores the bullishness in passenger traffic growth in the long term. The only profit making airline is slated to raise money through an IPO, and the strategy to acquire the same aircraft would bring down maintenance, overhauling and spare-part costs. GoAir had also placed orders for 72 similar aircraft in 2011, valued at about $7 billion.\n\nHowever, competition is growing after the government allowed overseas airline companies to invest in domestic carriers that badly needed cash to expand and repay debt. Etihad has invested in Jet, AirAsia India has started operations and Vistara, jointly owned by the Tata group and Singapore Airlines, has also entered the market. The country's growth prospects are not in doubt. However, we also need to strategise policy to comfortably handle 300 million passengers annually. Cost-effective, efficient airports, air traffic control and maintenance-repair-overhaul infrastructure are also important elements of the aviation infrastructure that must work to make India attractive to investors."]}, "Bayer": {"2014-11-28": ["City may need to replace Frank Lampard, whose loan ends in December\n\nManchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has not ruled out making new signings in the January transfer window.\n\nThe champions look to have a serious fight on their hands to retain their Barclays Premier League crown with leaders Chelsea currently setting a ferocious pace.\n\nThat might tempt City back into the transfer market at the campaign's halfway stage, as might continued involvement in the Champions League.\n\nCity, who face Roma early next month, still have a chance of reaching the knockout stages of the European competition following Tuesday's stunning defeat of Bayern Munich.\n\n'It's a thing that maybe we will talk in a few weeks more,' said Pellegrini.

We are not thinking about that because I think it's important to trust in the squad that we have.'\n\nThe restrictions Pellegrini refers to are those imposed by UEFA last summer after the club breached the European governing body's Financial Fair Play regulations.\n\nCity were limited to a net spend of \u00a349million in the last transfer window and also had to limit their Champions League squad to 21 players, as opposed to the regular 25.\n\nFear of further sanctions will limit the amount the club are prepared to spend while the squad cap leaves little room for manoeuvre.\n\nOne player the club would be able to replace, however, is former England midfielder Frank Lampard, whose loan from sister club New York City is due to expire at the end of December.\n\nThere has been speculation City might seek to extend the deal to compensate for Yaya Toure's likely involvement in the African Cup of Nations, but that might not stretch to the resumption of the Champions League.\n\nPellegrini maintains that a decision on Lampard will not be taken until some time next month.\n\n'When we have to make a decision, we will make a decision,' said the Chilean.\n\nOne obvious area City might wish to strengthen is up front, despite the prolific output of Sergio Aguero.\n\nAguero has scored 17 goals this season but fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic have netted just seven between them. The sale of Alvaro Negredo, forced partly for Financial Fair Play reasons, has also taken away an extra option.\n\nBut Pellegrini, speaking at a press conference to preview this weekend's trip to Southampton, would not be drawn on that matter.\n\nHe said: 'In this moment if I say I think that maybe we are not scoring too many goals, then everyone will think that we need more players.", "Ronald Koeman believes \"something special\" can be achieved at Southampton this season if they can prove their mettle in the coming weeks, starting this weekend against Manchester City.\n\nAn unparalleled talent drain in the summer led to much doom and gloom around St Mary's, yet the response has been nothing short of astonishing.\n\nKoeman's side are second in the Premier League after their best-ever start to a top-flight season and boast the tightest defense in English football.\n\nThat form has led to much discussion as to whether Saints can actually see off the traditional giants and qualify for the Champions League - a feat Koeman believes could become more realistic over the coming weeks.\n\n\"We try to play game by game and prepare ourselves in the best way for every game,\" the Dutchman said ahead of City's visit.\n\n\"We know our possibilities but we have played 12 games now and I didn't see one team better than us in these 12 games and we played against Liverpool and Tottenham. Maybe Sunday but we will see.\n\n\"(Man City) will take this game very seriously. They know that we are strong.\n\n\"It's one of the qualities is the organization in the team and if you don't have that organization it's not possible to concede only six goals in 12 games.\n\n\"They know, for sure, they have to be good to win against us and the challenge for us is to beat a good team in the Premier League.\n\n\"We have the supporters at our back and that will be important for Sunday.\"\n\nWhile most onlookers have been taken aback by the manner in which Saints have started the campaign, the doubters will point to the level of opposition as a caveat to that success.\n\nTottenham and Liverpool are the only traditional powers they have come up against and represent Koeman's only defeats in all competitions.\n\nThat will change over the next nine games, though, with Sunday's match against City followed quickly by, amongst others, a double-header with Arsenal and home fixtures against Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\n\"I think if we would like to do better than last season, this period is important because we played nine games until January 1 and that's difficult, a difficult programme,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"Everybody knows there isn't an easy game in the Premier League and you have to be prepared every game.\n\n\"We know if we like to do something special this season then we have to win these kind of games that we have to play.\"\n\nKey to a positive result on Sunday will be shackling in-form City striker Sergio Aguero.\n\nFresh from single-handedly helping City to a 3-2 comeback win against Bayern Munich, the 26-year-old is sure to give the Saints back line their biggest test yet.\n\n\"I think that the best player to compare to Aguero is Romario,\" former Barcelona defender Koeman said.\n\n\"I played with him but sometimes you think he is sleeping and in one split second he is scoring. That's a big quality because that means a lot of concentration for the defender.\n\n\"He's always fast, he's always on the shoulder of the last defender and that's his best quality.\"\n\nOne of those to play alongside Romario and Koeman in that impressive Barca outfit of the 1990s will be sat in the stands on Sunday.\n\nTxiki Begiristain was an important member of the Blaugrana for many years and is City's director of football after holding that role at the Nou Camp for a number of years.\n\n\"I have good contact with him still,\" Koeman said. \"We had a great time together in Barcelona.\n\n\"I saw him two weeks ago at a League Managers Association meeting about the work of Manuel Pellegrini and we had time to speak to each other about the past and about the future.\n\n\"We will see each other this Sunday and we look forward because these kind of games for us are the best to play.\"", "GUS POYET thinks Sunderland will have to beat the best 'overall team' in Europe in order to become the first to defeat a Jose Mourinho-led Chelsea three times inside 12 months.\n\nThe Blues are already six points clear at the top of the Premier League after avoiding defeat in any of their opening 12 matches. Chelsea's form is made all the more impressive by remaining unbeaten in both the Champions League and Capital One Cup along the way.\n\nOn Tuesday Mourinho's men sent shock-waves around Europe by heading to Germany, where Bundesliga teams are normally so difficulty to breakdown, to defeat Schalke 5-0. That has led to increased predictions Chelsea could go the entire season without defeat, particularly domestically.\n\nBut Poyet, albeit before the summer arrivals of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas at Stamford Bridge, knows exactly what it feels like to beat the West Londoners. In April, Poyet became the first manager to inflict a home defeat on Mourinho at the Bridge and that arrived five months after Sunderland won 2-1 at the Stadium of Light.\n\n\"Three wins in a row against Jose? No I can't believe that,\" said Poyet. \"We're usually on the wrong end of stats, we hadn't won for ages on a Monday night and we didn't beat someone for 50 years, but now we're on the right side. Let me enjoy it a little bit. It's a game I'd like to play in but we know how tough it's going to be because Jose will want to continue his run.\n\n\"We'll see on Saturday. If there's rain and wind it could make the game very ugly. It's difficult to say if they can go unbeaten all season because there's such a long way to go but if there's one team who can do it, then it's probably Chelsea.\"\n\nSchalke boss Roberto Di Matteo, a former Chelsea boss, played with Poyet at Stamford Bridge and felt his old friend might give him in an insight in to what is required to stop the league leaders in midweek. Instead he felt worse.\n\n\"I said come on, show me the way,\" said Poyet. \"He didn't! Chelsea defend better than any team in Europe. They defend better than Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern.\n\n\"As a team Chelsea are very difficult to play against, they are special and they are unique, they defend well and are difficult to beat, they pass the ball well and they've always got options.\n\n\"They're really strong and if they keep everyone fit, it's going to be close (to go unbeaten). At the start of the season I thought they were favourites.\n\n\"Now, they're massive favourites to win the Premier League. If nothing strange happens, they're going to win the league. I'm convinced of that. They're going to win it without losing, or maybe lose one on the way, we'll see but they're the best team in the country by far now.\"\n\nRegardless of the fantastic shape Chelsea are in, Poyet wants to see Sunderland continue their recent improved fortunes and results by stunning the star-studded visitors.\n\n\"They're better than us technically, physically, without any doubt and they've been outstanding as a team so we need to be very strong mentally and of course have a good day as well,\" he said. \"If we don't cope with the inferiority complex then we've got no chance.\n\n\"You can combat that with your own mental strength, now that's not easy but it's a good feeling that we've been there and somehow we've done it so we have to go out there with belief and I don't want to think the other way round. It's a great chance and we're the ones with the opportunity now. Let's try.\"\n\nWinger Ricky Alvarez is available again for Sunderland after a calf injury but Poyet is in no mood to make major changes to a team which has collected five points from the last three matches - even if he is yet to name the same starting line-up in consecutive games this season.\n\n\"I've not named the same team twice in succession,\" said Poyet, whose side face Manchester City and Liverpool after the visit of Chelsea.\n\n\"I hate that (being called tinkerman) because, from Saturday to Saturday, if the team does well, the team should stay the same.\n\n\"But you need to perform well to make sure that happens. I hated it at Chelsea when the manager always tinkered. It's called squad rotation but I hate that. Do you think if we beat Chelsea on Saturday, I'll change the team for Wednesday against Man City?

Barry Shiels\n\nJJ: I'm not retiring!\n\nWould it be fair to say given your obvious talent you have under-achieved? Paul Davis\n\nJJ: Yes and no. Don't get me wrong... I'm more than happy with what I've achieved as a player, but I understand that at the start of my career it was a bit of a whirlwind and people were asking \"what is this kid going to go on and achieve?\"\n\nBut losing Bobby Robson, for me, was bigger than people think it was. At that point in my career he really understood me as a player - when I needed a rest, when I needed to go back home or when to play me, when not to play me and how to play me. He had the exact formula for what I needed to go on and develop as a player and it was kind of going back to square one in my mind. It shook me a little bit and I took the chance to go to Spurs.\n\nOne thing I would say is the injuries have played their part nd I definitely played injured for a few years purely and simply because I wanted to play the game. I loved football and it probably took 10 or 20% out of my play, but I was out there and I was doing my best for the team.\n\nI'd still rather be out there than complaining about a little niggle, which probably wasn't good for me in the long-term... as it proved.\n\nWhat was the mood like at training following the infamous \"Dyer vs Bowyer\" incident? Awkward, or was it a frustration that they needed to get out of their system? Jack Fairclough\n\nJJ: That was one of the weirdest incidents I came across at Newcastle because really there was no issue between Kieron and Lee at all. It was just a shock!\n\nI remember seeing it happen on the pitch and the one thing which stood out in my mind is once we got in the changing room after the game, there was a bit of a moment. A lot of the players were angry because we went down to nine men for a large part of the game and we lost the game to Villa subsequently. A lot of the guys were like \"if you want to fight, let's have it now, get at it now\", but I think what they were both saying was it was just a really crazy moment in their careers and they were both really ashamed of it, but couldn't believe it.\n\nI've been in dressing rooms where people don't like each other and it could kick off at any time, but that definitely wasn't the case. We'd see each other outside of football... the atmosphere when we came back in on Monday morning was almost jovial. They obviously had a bit of a photo op and a smile and put it to bed and that was it. There was no animosity in training. Put to bed. Game over!\n\nWould you, given the chance, play for Nottingham Forest again and do you think they will win promotion this year? Steve Musson\n\nJJ: Yes I would, definitely, given the chance. People sometimes ask me what my biggest regret is in football and it's not being able to have that 'Steven Gerrard' moment where he's playing for the team that he loves in terms of where he's from. He went to school in that area, all his friends and family are in that area... and although I got to do that for Forest, I didn't get to do it at the top level.\n\nI do believe the Championship is as weird as it's ever been this year. I looked the other day after Forest's very poor run of games and they were still only six or seven points from top - they hadn't won in eight or nine games... it was ludicrous! But looking at the squad they're capable of going up. I think they were favourites at the start so we'll see....\n\nWhat is your most treasured moment in your football career? Michael Saltmarsh\n\nJJ: I won the League Cup with Spurs and that was big as a team accolade - I remember speaking to Robbie Keane after we won at Man City and we were just desperate to win something. I think Man Utd were cleaning up at the time, winning everything and Chelsea would nick one here and there - not many people were getting the chance to win trophies and we were just so desperate to win one. We progressed, progressed, progressed and when we won it, people almost belittled that trophy at times. But as a team moment that was huge and when you speak to Spurs fans they look back and could identify with that team, whereas now they're struggling to do that.\n\nAs a personal moment it would be winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award in 2003. For most players in the Premier League to sit down and say \"I think Jermaine was the best player at that time, in that league\" and to go among the names on that trophy and for it to sit in my house - that was big for me. It was a moment not a lot of people get to achieve in their career.\n\nWould you ever have signed for Arsenal as an ex-Tottenham player? Dwayne Clarke\n\nJJ: After playing for Tottenham? Naaaah. I've got a mother-in-law who's a big Spurs fan and I don't think I'd be allowed back in the house to be honest with you! There'd be no Sunday dinners for a long time, I tell you that!\n\nI know guys that have done it in the past, but I spent seven or eight years at Tottenham and sometimes you really have to just respect certain things that have happened in your career and doing something like that just erases it.\n\nWas it frustrating not getting on the pitch at the World Cup in Germany in 2006, or were you just pleased to be a part of it? Stuart Steelyard\n\nJJ: I was frustrated. I didn't go there to just sit on the bench. Me and Sven had a bit of a love/hate relationship to be honest. He's the one who gave me my debut and brought me through, but then there were games when I didn't feature or he brought me on at right-wing and I didn't feel like I got a fair crack at it to an extent. It was mad because in the first game I think we were 1-0 up and he called me to say \"right, you're going on\" and I got changed... and the final whistle went!\n\nI was devastated. I wanted to play for England at a World Cup and to grace the pitch for even two minutes at such a big tournament would have been huge. That's not to say I'd rather have stayed at home at all. The experience was special but unfortunately the usual happened and we went out on penalties.\n\nDo you think Southampton will be a surprise top-four finisher come the end of the season, or would it be better to judge them after Christmas? Kyle Arron Vincent Jones\n\nJJ: That Christmas period is just so important. You're playing a load of games in a short period and it takes a toll on the squad physically and mentally and you can really maintain your position or sink like a ship by January.\n\nBut having seen Southampton quite a few times I'm optimistic. I've seen them play better than they have in recent weeks, but hopefully for Saints that's not cracks appearing.\n\nWe've seen it before with Everton when they kept going and kept going and everyone said \"are they going to keep this up?\" and then they did it. I don't think Southampton will finish in the top four, but I think they'll finish in a very respectable position - top eight and above.\n\nWho will win the Champions League this season? Michael W Ward\n\nJJ: This is a tough one. Real Madrid, attacking-wise, are just scary but for some reason I don't see them being able to retain it. I think Chelsea have as good a chance as anyone because that team with Mourinho know how to play badly and win. They've got that mentality where they can go into games at, say, the Bernabeu and be able to say 'we might not win today, but we're not going to lose', and I don't think there are many teams that can do that.\n\nI was impressed with Bayern Munich at Man City the other day, but if I had to say one, I'd probably say Chelsea.

Southampton have faced only two teams who finished in the top seven last season - Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur - and they lost both of those matches.\n\nThat is why Sunday's game at home to Manchester City is so important: this is a real test of just how good they are and it comes at the beginning of an extremely tricky run of games.\n\nAfter City, Southampton face Arsenal (away), Manchester United (home), Burnley (away), Everton (home), Crystal Palace (away), Chelsea (home), Arsenal (home) and Manchester United (away).\n\nIn the next seven weeks, they play nine league games, seven of which are against sides who finished in the top seven last season.\n\nIt could be that the good start gives them confidence and Southampton are able to maintain their form, taking perhaps 14 or 15 points from those matches.\n\nOr it could be that such a glut of tough games derails them completely.\n\nThe example of the worst-case scenario is Sunderland in 2010/11. They were sixth at the beginning of February, but then took a single point from a run of seven games against the previous season's top six plus Stoke City. They did not recover until Steve Bruce was dismissed the following December.\n\nCity are beatable, but they have shown recent signs of improvement, even if much of it is rooted in Sergio Aguero's clinical run in front of goal.\n\nAlthough they were poor at Queens Park Rangers and fortunate to get away with a 2-2 draw two weeks ago, coming from behind to beat Swansea City and then Bayern Munich suggests that at least there is character in the side.\n\nThere were also, perhaps, glimmers against Swansea of Yaya Toure returning to some sort of form.\n\nAt the same time, Southampton's display in the draw against Aston Villa on Monday, in which they badly missed Steven Davis, who is still out with his hamstring problem, was their least fluent for some time.\n\nIn that sense, the performance against City on Sunday is almost more important than the result: they need to prove they can compete against that level of opponent.\n\nSunday will go a long way to telling us just how good are Southampton.\n\nsports@thenational.ae\n\nFollow our sports coverage on Twitter @SprtNationalUAE", "Wenger backs injured Wilshere to bounce back Published: 28 Nov 2014 at 22.44 | Viewed: 238 | Comments: 0 Online news: Sports Writer: AFP - +\n\nLONDON - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger predicted on Friday that Jack Wilshere will \"come back stronger\" after the England midfielder was ruled out for three months following ankle surgery.\n\nArsenal's English midfielder Jack Wilshere damaged ankle ligaments in a challenge during the league match against Manchester United in London on November 22, 2014\n\nWilshere, 22, damaged ankle ligaments in a tackle by Paddy McNair during Arsenal's 2-1 loss at home to Manchester United in the Premier League last weekend and underwent surgery on Thursday.\n\nHe previously spent 17 months on the sidelines after sustaining a stress fracture of the other ankle in July 2011, but Wenger believes he has sufficient strength of character to overcome his latest setback.\n\n\"He is very down. Jack is a football man who loves the game, but on the other hand, he is a very strong character as well and he has learnt to deal with adversity from a very young age,\" said Wenger.\n\n\"I think he will be back at the end of February, beginning of March, and he will focus on coming back to rehab, having a strong rehab, and then I am sure he will help us to do well until the end of the season.\n\n\"Jack always came out stronger and, when I spoke with him, the final sprint of the season is already in his mind and (he wants) to come back stronger.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wilshere took to photo-sharing website Instagram on Friday to dispute an assertion by British newspaper Daily Mirror that he had \"brittle ankles\".\n\nAlongside a photograph of McNair's challenge, which shows Wilshere's left ankle being twisted at an unnatural angle, he wrote: \"As this picture clearly shows most people/players would have broken their ankle if someone tackled them like this.\n\n\"Luckily I have 'loose joints', not brittle' and only damaged ligaments.\"\n\nWenger said that McNair's challenge, which went unpunished, was \"very bad\", but accepted that it was \"not malicious\".\n\nHe said: \"When you see it again, I don't think that anybody would have escaped without surgery in this tackle.\"\n\nWilshere is the latest in a long list of Arsenal players to have succumbed to injury and Wenger said that he would look to bring in \"at least one body\" during the January transfer window to bolster his squad.\n\nHowever, he denied press reports that he is interested in signing out-of-favour Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech and said there had been \"no enquiry from anybody\" for unsettled Germany forward Lukas Podolski.\n\nTell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article More on this topic\n\nPacquiao would take less to fight Mayweather says manager\n\nPublished: 25 Nov 2014 Total views: 644\n\nThailand edge out Singapore\n\nPublished: 24 Nov 2014 Total views: 598\n\nPele says he's 'doing fine' in hospital\n\nPublished: 28 Nov 2014 Total views: 361\n\nFive-try Scotland see off Tonga\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 312\n\nSchweinsteiger poised for Bayern comeback\n\nPublished: 22 Nov 2014 Total views: 307\n\nSpieth claims Sydney lead\n\nPublished: 28 Nov 2014 Total views: 0\n\nSpurs rally to beat Pacers without coach Popovich\n\nPublished: 28 Nov 2014 Total views: 0\n\n'Pacman' beats Algieri in title bout\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 2,712\n\nMurray and Sears engaged\n\nPublished: 28 Nov 2014 Total views: 0\n\nKohli ready for challenge of leading India against Aussies\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 734\n\nThitipong determined to fight on in Moto2\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 146\n\nHughes rushed to hospital after being struck in head\n\nPublished: 26 Nov 2014 Total views: 0\n\nOther stories in this category * Wenger backs injured Wilshere to bounce back * Nibali says 'not leaving' embattled cycling ... * Rodriguez, Schweinsteiger on World XI shortlist * Huge outpouring of grief for Australian ... * Pele improving but still on dialysis - hospital * Roy Keane leaves Aston Villa post Bangkok Post online classifieds\n\nTry buying & selling goods and properties 24/7 in our classifieds which has high purchasing power local & expatriate audience from within Thailand and around the world.", "Use this window to let us know of any feedback about the content.\n\nThe list for the FIFA FIFPro World XI 2014 announced by FIFPro, the worldwide players' union, and FIFA today features 15 midfielders as part of the final 55-player shortlist to be revealed on 1 December 2014.

Isco returns to the ground where he made his reputation as a footballer.\n\nSpeaking after the Basel game, Kroos admitted that he was feeling the effects of a long season in which he formed part of the Germany squad which won the World Cup in Brazil.\n\n\"I played the second half of last season with Bayern Munich then I played all matches of the World Cup, then two Supercups with Real Madrid and I have not missed a game since then.

Sometimes you think he's sleeping then in one split second he's scoring. It's a big quality.\n\n\"That means a lot of concentration for defenders. He's always fast, always on the line of sight. That's his best quality.\"\n\nCity will leapfrog Southampton into second with a win at St Mary's on Sunday, however the Saints - unbeaten at home in the Premier League - could move five points clear of the Blues if they make it four league wins in five.", "Southampton have the meanest defence in the Premier League but a run of fixtures that will test their staying power at the top of the table to the limit\n\n* Premier League: 10 things to look out for\n\nThe moment of truth is almost here for Southampton and they cannot put it off any longer. Like a deadline looming on the horizon it has crept up on them slowly but it has always been waiting for them and for their detractors. Those who believe the Saints are in a false position in the table have been looking forward to it all season. Wait until Southampton have a run of games against the top sides, they have said after each victory, then we will see how good they really are.\n\nThe time has come and it will be fascinating to see how Southampton cope. For all the plaudits that have been deservedly showered on them after their wonderful start, some people have remained unconvinced, arguing that the reason Ronald Koeman's side are second is because the fixture list has been kind to them and that they will slide back into mid-table eventually.\n\nIt is a fair question and although they would probably not want to admit it, Southampton must have wondered it themselves. Everyone has doubts, even when everything is going well, and the time has come for a forensic examination of Southampton credentials. Sunday's visit of Manchester City is daunting enough but after facing the champions, Southampton go to Arsenal on Wednesday night and then host Manchester United next Monday. By 11 January, they will also have played Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea at St Mary's and been to Old Trafford. This period has been highlighted by red ink in the diary for a while and we will know a lot more about Southampton when it is over.\n\nThere is no escaping it but Koeman sees the positives. \"If we want to do better than last season, this period is important because we play nine games till 1 January and that's difficult, but everybody knows there isn't an easy game in the Premier League,\" Southampton's manager said. \"We know if we want to do something special then we have to win these kind of games.\n\n\"One of our qualities is our organisation. If you don't have that organisation it's not possible to concede six goals in 12 games. They know they have to be good. The challenge for us is to beat a big team in the Premier League.\"\n\nSouthampton have failed on that count twice already, losing narrowly at Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, yet there is a growing belief about them. \"We played 12 games now and I didn't see one team better than us,\" Koeman said.\n\nKoeman is so very Dutch. Unlike a lot of managers, he is not afraid of sharing his opinions on any topic and he is bullish about Southampton's quality. No one expected them to be this good after the sale of five first-team players and the loss of their previous manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to Tottenham in the summer. No one, that is, expect Koeman.\n\nIt was put to him on Friday that Southampton were being tipped for relegation in August. \"But every person can have his own opinion about the team,\" Koeman countered. \"I think we have a strong team, we play with good organisation but we realise that this Sunday we play against one of the teams who can win the title and who won the title last season. I said before that it is not easy to beat Southampton and we will show that on Sunday.\"\n\nThe beauty of the situation for Southampton is that this is a free hit because there is more pressure on City to perform. It will not be a seismic event for Southampton if they lose but a win would move them five points above City.\n\nSouthampton have been gripped by 'Koemania' all season but there were signs that they were weighed down by expectation during Monday's 1-1 draw at Aston Villa. They did not play with the same sharpness, while Graziano Pell\u00e8 has not found the net in his past four matches in the league after scoring nine goals in his first 12.\n\nPerhaps they will be able to play with the shackles off against City but they will also have to find a way of stopping Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who will stretch even the Premier League's stingiest defence. Ag\u00fcero scored a hat-trick in City's win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday and Koeman likens him to Rom\u00e1rio, his old team-mate at Barcelona.\n\n\"Sometimes you think he's sleeping and then in one split second he is scoring and that is a big quality,\" Koeman said. \"He is the player who makes the difference for City in the last few weeks. He creates opportunities by himself. It's a nice challenge for our defenders. You need that attention for 90 or 95 minutes.\"\n\nBut why should Southampton be scared? They have nothing to lose. They believe they will rise to the occasion.", "Ronald Koeman wants Southampton to prove they are capable of achieving \"something special\" this season by beating Manchester City on Sunday.\n\nThe south-coast club are second in the Premier League after winning eight of their first 12 games and suffering only two defeats in a sensational start under Koeman.\n\nSouthampton had been tipped for a season of struggle after losing a host of key players, who followed manager Mauricio Pochettino through the St Mary's Stadium exit door.\n\nBut rather than bracing himself for a relegation battle, Koeman has set his sights on securing a UEFA Champions League spot in his first season in English football.\n\nThe Dutchman knows the visit of champions Manchester City will be a major test for Southampton, but the former Netherlands defender is backing his side to rise to the challenge.\n\n\"We realise that this Sunday we play against one of the teams who can win the title,\" said Koeman.\n\n\"We've shown before that it's not easy to beat Southampton, and we'll show that on Sunday.\n\n\"If we want to do something special this season, then we have to win these types of games.\n\n\"They have a strong squad and good players. In the last few weeks [Sergio] Aguero has made the difference.\n\n\"Manchester City will take this game seriously. They know that we are strong and that they'll have to be good to beat us.\"\n\nCity will go above Southampton into second spot if they consign Koeman's men to a first home defeat of the season.\n\nManuel Pellegrini's side head into the game on the back of a dramatic 3-2 UEFA Champions League win over Bayern Munich in midweek, which kept their hopes of qualifying for the last 16 alive.\n\nSouthampton's impressive start to the season has led to them being described as a surprise package, but City boss Pellegrini's eyebrows have not been raised by their impressive form.\n\nThe Chilean said: \"Southampton are a good team with very good players and they're playing very well. It's no surprise they are where they are.\n\n\"Koeman has lost four or five players but they are still a good team and that's a merit to him. It will be a tough game.\"\n\nSouthampton have conceded only one goal at St Mary's this season - against QPR in September - but they will have to be at their best to keep in-form striker Aguero quiet.\n\nThe Argentina forward scored a hat-trick against European champions Bayern and has 18 goals to his name already this season.\n\nCity will be without Edin Dzeko (thigh), David Silva (knee) and Aleksandar Kolarov (calf), but Yaya Toure and Fernandinho are back in the squad after missing the win over Bayern due to suspension.\n\nSouthampton midfielder Steven Davis is rated as doubtful due to a hamstring problem.", "Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has challenged his defence to outwit Sergio Aguero after likening him to Brazil great Romario.\n\nThe Argentina striker has been in sensational form for Manchester City so far this season and he leads the Premier League scoring charts with 12 goals from as many games.\n\nAguero, 26, has also proven decisive in the UEFA Champions League, with Tuesday's hat-trick in the 3-2 win over Bayern Munich keeping City's hopes alive in the competition and taking his tally this term to five.\n\nAnd Koeman, whose Southampton side host City on Sunday, has joined Aguero's lost list of admirers, comparing him to former Brazil and Barcelona star Romario.\n\n\"The best player to compare to Aguero is Romario,\" he told reporters. \"I played with him [Romario]. Sometimes you think he's sleeping, then in one split second he's scoring. It's a big quality.\n\n\"That means a lot of concentration for defenders. He's always fast, always on the line of sight. That's his best quality.\n\n\"That's the nicest part of football; you can't do everything to stop a player. It's one of the best players, the player who makes the difference between winning and not winning for City.\n\n\"They have a strong squad, good players, but in the last few games Aguero makes the difference, scoring and creating.\n\n\"He's creating opportunities by himself. We have a strong defence; it's a nice challenge for our defenders to keep the zero behind.\n\n\"You can't give them one second, no attention.

Remember when onlookers suggested that they had read the words 'Yep he's gone - get him out' come from owner Mike Ashley's mouth after the dreadful 1-0 defeat to Stoke? Although Pardew still struggles to fully win over the Magpies faithful, he will surely have them coming round to his powers, with Newcastle looking for their seventh consecutive win this weekend.\n\nThey face a tough task at Upton Park against a West Ham side whose defeat at Everton last week - with thanks to a clearly offside opening goal - was their first loss in 6 matches. Few would have predicted prior to the season than this fixture, at the end of November, would be pitting sixth against fifth. Newcastle have a decent record at the Boleyn Ground, where they have won 4 and lost only 1 of their last 8 matches. Injuries could cost them though, with as many as 13 Newcastle players potentially missing out, and West Ham, with the most headed goals (8) and goals from outside the box (5) in the Premier League this season, could take advantage.\n\nSouthampton vs Manchester City\n\nWith every passing week it is hard to shake the inevitability that Southampton's incredible start to the season will soon come to an end, and yet they continue to impress and continue to win. Now 12 games into the campaign after they spent the summer being torn apart, they remain second in the table and dreaming of European - or even Champions League - qualification.\n\nWhat should be clarified of their start, however, is that the two games they have lost have been their only two against any of last season's top 7. Both Liverpool and Tottenham overcame Ronald Koeman's men, and Saints now face a run of games in which 4 of their next 5 opponents finished above them last season, starting with Manchester City on Sunday.\n\nCity themselves will be buoyed after a rousing 3-2 win over Bayern Munich that kept their own European hopes alive, but it was once again Sergio Ag\u00fcero who they relied upon to bail them out. The Argentine has scored 17 of his team's 31 goals (54.8%) in the Premier and Champions League this season, and having netted their goal in this fixture last season, he will pose a real threat to the hosts' impeccable defensive record.\n\nTottenham vs Everton\n\nTottenham return this weekend to the ground that has seen suffer so much in recent weeks: White Hart Lane. As Emmanuel Adebayor pointed out, the Spurs players are finding it difficult playing in front of an increasingly frustrated home faithful in north London, and with more home losses (4) than any other team in the top flight, the problems are glaringly apparent.\n\nThis week Mauricio Pochettino's team, languishing in 10 place, host Everton this weekend, with only goal difference separating the teams. Neither will be content with their early season endeavours thus far, and neither, given what has happened so far, would likely settle for a draw in this one.\n\nBoth teams come into the game after a Europa League clash on Thursday. Spurs have struggled terribly to deal with the schedule the tournament throws up for them, losing 4 of the 6 games they have played directly after continental action this season. Everton, meanwhile, have had difficulty adjusting, winning just 1 of their 4 Premier League matches immediately following Europa League games this season. The winner of this match could well be the side that copes better with the adversities of the Europa League.", "Manuel Pellegrini believes Sergio Aguero is one of the top five players in the world and feels he is not far behind the dominant duo of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.\n\nAguero took his tally this season to 17 goals in 18 games with a hat-trick as Manchester City beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday. Between them, Messi and Ronaldo have won the Ballon d'Or in the last six years and City manager Pellegrini, who coached the Portuguese during his season in charge of Real Madrid, feels Aguero is closing in on them.\n\nHe said: \"We are always trying to demand to Sergio to fight always to be the best player in the world because he can do it. I am sure he is in the top five. I don't think he is better than Cristiano or Messi but he must be very near.\"\n\nAguero has scored 14 of City's last 23 goals and they have been accused of relying on the forward too much. Pellegrini, who only has two fit strikers, admits it would be difficult to find an alternative to him, but pointed out that the 26-year-old suffered from injuries last season and City still became champions.\n\n\"I think than no one can replace Messi at Barcelona, Ronaldo at Real Madrid or Sergio here. It is not the same to play with Aguero or without Aguero,\" Pellegrini added. \"I always say we have a squad and if for different reasons Sergio cannot play, we must have another one that can do it.\n\n\"If you remember, we won the title here last year with a lot of games without Sergio but when he plays, it makes a difference.\"\n\nAguero is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance when City travel to Southampton on Sunday. Only Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy have scored more goals in their first century of appearances in the division than Aguero, who has struck 64 times.\n\nPellegrini said: \"It is difficult to compare careers of very important players. Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy are players who have already finished their careers. Sergio is not starting but just 26 years old. He has many years more to play here.\n\n\"I am always asking and demanding that he tries to be the best player because he has all the conditions to do that. That is why I am very glad for him he is always improving every day.\"\n\nPellegrini believes Aguero is remaining fitter this year because he was eased into the season with substitute appearances.\n\nHe added: \"I think that this year we prepare him in the correct way because if you remember in the first three games including Community Shield, we didn't play with Sergio. We just gave him 20-25 minutes, no more, so he could have a good pre-season because he needs that after the last season when he has a lot of injuries.\"", "The public has chosen stand-up comedian Eddie Izzard as their 2014 public language champion.\n\nThe award was announced on Friday at the Guardian and British Academy 2014 Schools Language Awards in central London as part of the annual Language Festival. The Public Language Champion award invites Guardian readers to nominate public figures that promote the value of speaking another language.\n\nEddie Izzard is a long-time advocate for the importance of language learning. Readers highlight his international tour Force Majeure which sees him delivering sets in Arabic, German, Spanish and French. As part of the tour, and to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day, he also performed the show three times in three different languages.\n\n\"I am very happy to win this award,\" Eddie Izzard said. \"I believe we have to tell people that learning another language is actually an adventure. It is tough, it needs work, but what it will do is that it will open up another country to you with all the colours of their people, their food, their customs, their sports and their culture. And you will become better human being by going on that adventure.\"\n\nSpeaking of his relationship with language learning, Eddie Izzard recently told the Guardian's language learning series: \"There's a political basis for me to learning other languages, because if we don't come together in the world then the world's not going to make it.\"\n\nOther nominees this year included Pep Guardiola, the manager of Bayern Munich football club, and Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister. The winner was chosen by judges from the Guardian and the British Academy. Eddie Izzard follows Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, manager of Arsenal football club, who won the award last year.\n\nThe public language champion award is part of an ongoing campaign with the British Academy to raise the profile of language learning in the UK.\n\nRead more stories:\n\n* Why languages matter to me: Eddie Izzard, Alastair Campbell and more\n\n* Paddy Ashdown: 'Learning six languages has changed my life'\n\n* 'In the Patagonian desert I met a petrol attendant who spoke perfect Welsh'", "Two months ago, Bayern Munich star Xherdan Shaqiri confirmed that Liverpool tried to sign him during the summer (for \u20ac18m), and with Brendan Rodgers' summer signings abjectly failing to fill the Luis Suarez void, it looks like the Reds may finally be in with a genuine chance of signing Shaqiri.\n\nIn September, Shaqiri - hailed as 'world class' by Munich's Sporting Director Mattias Sammer - told reporters:\n\n\"Liverpool made a bid for me before the World Cup but Bayern put their foot down and told me, 'We're not going to sell you\"\n\nLiverpool continue to be linked with Shaqiri, and reports over the weekend indicate that Bayern have now decided that the Swiss star is surplus to requirements. According to The Mirror:\n\n* Bayern have 'sounded out' LFC, Arsenal, Napoli and Atletico Madrid over Shaqiri.\n\n* The club is willing to loan out the attacker in January.\n\n* The German giants want a \u20ac2m loan fee, with a \u20ac14m option-to-buy attached.\n\nBased on Shaqiri's recent comments, staying at Bayern doesn't seem like a viable option:\n\n\"I'm not going through another year like this. I am disappointed because I have played less. I am young and need to develop myself. I want to play in the big games from the beginning, and the Champions League is important to me.\"\n\nShaqiri is averaging a paltry 36 minutes of pitch-time per game this season, and with the huge array of top players at the Allianz Arena, that's unlikely to change anytime soon. Clearly, if he really wants to 'develop himself', the best thing for the Swiss star to do is leave, and it looks like he'll now have the opportunity to do that.\n\nAlas, if it comes down to a straight battle between Arsenal and Liverpool, then there's probably only going to be one winner. Arsene Wenger remains a huge draw for top players, and presence of players like Ozil and Sanchez at the Emirates will probably be a huge attraction. Plus, there's the London factor to consider, which is one of the main reasons Sanchez chose the Gunners over the Reds this summer.\n\nThat said, after wasting so much money over the summer, a \u00a31.5m loan deal is just what Liverpool need. Shaqiri will have to prove himself to earn a permanent deal, and that means he'll have to play out of skin to achieve that, which can only be a good thing for the Reds.\n\nJust imagine if Liverpool had signed Shaqiri instead of Markovic over the summer. There are no guarantees, but I feel confident that he would've had a significantly greater impact on the club.\n\nAuthor: Jaimie K", "Kayla DeLancey ...

David Silva had just missed a gilt-edged chance to double the lead in their 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 opener. Netherlands fans could have been forgiven for writing that Salvador clash off as a defeat.\n\nUntil, that is, Daley Blind, from the left touchline, launched a high, hanging ball forward towards Robin van Persie. Just inside the box, the watching world expected the Oranje captain to attempt to take it down. Instead, Van Persie produced an immaculate first-time header which looped over Iker Casillas and into the back of his net.\n\nIt was one of the greatest headers in football history. It KO'd Spain's dominance and set the Netherlands en route to a 5-1 victory in what was one of the most stunning results in World Cup history.\n\n\"Wow,\" said team-mate Arjen Robben afterwards. \"Just wow. It was an amazing goal. Who would have even tried to score from there?\"\n\nThe Dutch, of course, have been serial scorers of World Cup wonder goals. There was the Ruud Krol blockbuster that helped inflict a 4-0 reverse of Argentina in 1974. There was the Johan Cruyff volley in that same tournament.\n\nThere was Johnny Rep collecting the ball inside his own half, playing a one-two with Wim Jansen, advancing forward and cracking a 25-yard shot past Scotland goalkeeper Alan Rough in 1978, a competition which also saw Arie Haan net two long-range piledrivers and Ernie Brandts follow suit. Ruud Gullit against Republic of Ireland in 1990 and Dennis Bergkamp versus the Argentinians in '98 are other examples.\n\nAll, however, came before the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award was incepted in 2009. The following year two Dutchmen were shortlisted for the award: Giovanni van Brockhorst, for his thunderbolt against Uruguay at South Africa 2010, and Arjen Robben, for his dribble from the depths for Bayern Munich against Schalke.\n\nNeither managed to beat Hamit Altintop to the prize, but the third Netherlands national shortlisted for the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award is hoping to take it home.\n\nWill he?

Joe Hart's butterfingers and Gareth Barry's calamitous own goal contributed to a significant Saints win and - more damagingly for City - United's victory over Everton the following day hammered another nail in the coffin of their lacklustre title defence.\n\nEven Dani Osvaldo, whose greatest impact at Southampton was punching team-mate Jose Fonte, summoned up some inspiration to hit a belter past Costel Pantilimon and earn Southampton a draw last season.\n\nMauricio Pochettino's teams were energetic and stylish, yet Ronald Koeman has brought substance to the Premier League's surprise package. Ryan Giggs rightly noted in May Southampton \"tire\" in the last 30 minutes but Koeman's Saints have performed devastatingly in the final third of games, scoring 12 times. City are in for a fight.\n\nThe final curtain?\n\nCity's fingers were plied from the trophy two seasons ago at St Mary's and it could happen again this weekend. Sunderland shocked Chelsea in April but it is probable City will kick-off on Sunday lunchtime 11 points behind Jose Mourinho's team, which would be an insurmountable chasm.\n\nYes, City have shown remarkable powers of recovery in their two title wins in the last few years but however early it is in the campaign, staring that far up at a Mourinho side is cause to unveil the white flag.\n\nManuel Pellegrini has struggled with his selections this term but made amends in midweek with some influential substitutions. He cannot continue to get away with such costly errors, though.\n\nWho to recall?\n\nFernandinho has performed like a man reeling from his World Cup hangover and, specifically, the role he played in Germany's 7-1 annihilation of Brazil. The midfielder has struggled to bring the same impact to City as he did last season and Fernando has proven to be an able deputy.\n\nYaya Toure, also suspended for the midweek comeback against Bayern Munich, returned wearily from Brazil, too. He looks determined to put the Cakegate farce behind him, though, and his winner past Swansea followed on from an encouraging display at Queens Park Rangers two weeks earlier.\n\nFrank Lampard showed on his debut at Arsenal that his 36-and-a-half years struggle against active midfielders and it would be a surprise if he starts two games in a week.\n\nCan Mangala cement his place?\n\nRobert Lewandowski might have embarrassed City's defenders on occasion on Tuesday night but Eliaquim Mangala produced one of his most accomplished performances yet in a blue shirt.\n\nIrrespective of Bayern's one-man disadvantage, their spells of possession ensured City had to maintain their concentration in defence and Mangala did. His confidence was notable when, in the first half, he expertly trapped the ball and pinged a perfect 40-yard crossfield pass instinctively.\n\nHe has taken time to adapt to the Premier League but several superb defenders have. The Frenchman's belief might be battered if he fails to show Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic the same respect Lewandowski was afforded, however.\n\nWill Nasri step up?\n\nSamir Nasri's underwhelming form can no longer be attributed to taking baby steps after groin surgery. Had City boasted more attacking options on the bench against Bayern it is debatable whether he - and Jesus Navas - would have lasted the duration.\n\nThe Frenchman's toils have been accentuated by the absence of the majestic David Silva but Nasri was excellent last season and scored the goals that clinched both of City's trophies.\n\nUnfortunately for the Blues, he appears to be dining off those glories - and a new contract.", "Argentine has been in stunning goal-scoring form for City - but his manager is demanding more.\n\nManuel Pellegrini has told Sergio Aguero to prove he can be as good as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi by continuing his stunning goal-scoring form for Manchester City.\n\nThe Argentine's hat-trick completed a dramatic 3-2 win against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday and took his season's total to 17 in all competitions.\n\nAhead of his 100th Premier League appearance, Pellegrini has demanded more of the same as City look to close the gap on leaders Chelsea.\n\n\"Sergio is not just starting, but he's just 26 years old,\" said the Chilean. \"He has many years more to play here.\n\n\"I am always asking and demanding that he tries to be the best player because he has all the conditions to do that. That is why I am very glad for him that he is always improving every day.\n\n\"I am sure he is in the top five (players in the world). I don't think he is better than Cristiano or Messi, but he must be very near because he has all the conditions to do it.\"\n\nAguero's strike-rate has been vital in keeping City on the tails of Jose Mourinho's league leaders.\n\nPellegrini says he is now as important to City as Messi and Ronaldo are to Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively, but insists his reigning champions are not a one-man team.\n\n\"I think than no one can replace Messi at Barcelona, Ronaldo at Real Madrid or Sergio here - or a lot of very important players,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not the same to play with Aguero or without Aguero.

I am always asking and demanding that he tries to be the best player because he has all the conditions to do that.\n\n\"That is why I am very glad for him he is always improving every day.\n\n\"I think he is a top player, a very important striker here in the Premier League and we are very glad to have him in our team.\"\n\nAguero, 26, is set to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance since joining City for \u00a338million in 2011 as the champions travel to Southampton this weekend.\n\nOnly Alan Shearer (79) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (68) have scored more goals in their first 100 appearances than Aguero has in his first 99 (64).\n\nDespite his prolific output, and virtually beating Bayern single-handedly in midweek, Pellegrini insists City are not a one-man team.\n\nAguero did score 28 goals in all competitions last season but his contribution in the second half of the campaign, as City closed out title success, was limited due to injuries.\n\nPellegrini said: \"I always say we have a squad and if, for different reasons, Sergio cannot play, we must have another one that can do it.\n\n\"We hope he continues the same way but I suppose Edin (Dzeko) will be fit next week and he can score also. This team we never depend just on one striker. The last (league) game, Sergio didn't score and we won with a goal from (Stevan) Jovetic and one from Yaya Toure. If you remember, we won the title here last year with a lot of games without Sergio.\n\n\"But, when he plays, it makes a difference.\"\n\nAguero was injured in January and in and out of the team for the rest of the season after that, and also hampered at the World Cup.\n\nBecause of that Pellegrini eased him back into action at the start of this campaign, and that decision looks to have paid off.\n\nPellegrini said: \"You never know when a player will be injured but I think that this year we prepared him in the correct way.\n\n\"If you remember in the first three games, including the Community Shield, we didn't play with Sergio, we just gave him 20-25 minutes, no more, so he could have a good pre-season. He needed that after the last season when he had a lot of injuries.\n\n\"He is fit and we hope he will continue in this way until the end of the season.\"\n\nAguero has said that he views the game at Southampton as must-win, as it would enable City to leapfrog the high-flying Saints into second place.\n\nCity beat Swansea last weekend and are hoping to build some momentum with further games against Sunderland and Everton to come in the next week.\n\nPellegrini said: \"Yes, it is an important game because we need the three points and we can be in the second place. It is always better to be second than third but it is not only this game.\n\n\"This is the first game of the three we must play this week in the Premier League and I hope after the three we can be second place and be near to Chelsea.\"", "Manuel Pellegrini expects Edin Dzeko to make his Manchester City return \"next week\" after being sidelined by a thigh injury.\n\nThe Bosnia-Herzegovina international has not featured since coming off the bench in the 2-2 draw at QPR earlier this month and lasting only a few minutes before limping off.\n\nDzeko is not available for Sunday's Premier League game against second-placed Southampton, but could face either Sunderland on Wednesday or Everton three days later.\n\nCity manager Pellegrini also revealed that David Silva (knee) and Aleksandar Kolarov (calf) are not yet ready to return.\n\n\"No news about Silva, Kolarov or Dzeko - they will not be fit for this game. Everyone else is fit for this game,\" said the Chilean.\n\n\"I suppose Edin Dzeko will be fit next week. There are no complications with David Silva, it was a ligament injury and he is recovering.\"\n\nCity fought back to secure a stunning 3-2 victory over 10-man Bayern Munich in midweek courtesy of a hat-trick from Sergio Aguero.\n\nA win at Roma next month will ensure the Premier League side progress along with Bayern, provided the Bavarian giants beat CSKA Moscow at home in their final Group E game.\n\nPellegrini's men also came from behind to beat Swansea City 2-1 in the Premier League last weekend and the former Malaga coach believes both victories showed there in no disharmony in his squad.\n\n\"We can't complain about our spirit. We were losing against Swansea and we scored twice - the same against Bayern,\" he said.\n\nPellegrini welcomes Yaya Toure and Fernandinho back into the squad after they missed the win over the Bundesliga champions due to suspension.", "Champions Juventus host Torino in the 'Derby della Mole' on Sunday looking to reinforce their\n\nChampions Juventus host Torino in the 'Derby della Mole' on Sunday looking to reinforce their lead over title rivals Roma, who host Inter Milan in what will be Roberto Mancini's second game in charge of the Nerazzurri.\n\nFollowing a morale-boosting Champions League win over Malmo, Juventus returned to Turin on a high on Thursday with renewed hope of qualifying for the last 16 of the competition for the first time in two years.\n\nHaving won all five home games in Serie A this season, Massimiliano Allegri's side are expected to claim three points against a Torino side that was whistled off the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico following a 1-0 home defeat to Sassuolo last week.\n\nIndeed Torino's last victory over the Bianconeri goes back to the 1994-95 season, when they beat their city rivals home (3-2) and away (2-1), and they last hit the back of the Juventus net in February 2002 when the sides drew 2-2.\n\nSince then Juventus have won 12 and drawn four Turin derbies and are likely to again deploy the 4-3-1-2 formation that outclassed Lazio 3-0 away last week.\n\nDefender Simone Padoin, sent off for the final 20 minutes in Rome, sits out a one-match ban for Sunday allowing Patrice Evra to return to the fray.\n\nCentral defender Leonardo Bonucci has applauded the move away from a 3-5-2 tactical system which he believes has allowed Juve to spread their wings in Europe.\n\n\"Our tactical changes have made us stronger and more enterprising in Europe,\" Bonucci said after Wednesday's win in Sweden.\n\n\"Sometimes it means we find ourselves on a one-on-one situation in defence, but it gives us more options in attack.

And it's a case of so far, so good.\n\nSergio Aguero's stunning hat-trick to sink Bayern Munich kept their Champions League aspirations alive, and now they travel to Southampton hoping to breathe new fire into their Premier League hopes.\n\nManuel Pellegrini was claiming the Argentine was the best striker in the world this week. That's questionable but it's sobering to think where City would be without his 17 goals this season.\n\nThey wouldn't still be clinging on to Chelsea's coat-tails in third, that's for sure, and there's no doubt that without his five European goals they'd have crashed and burned out a long time ago.\n\nAs his captain Vincent Kompany said in midweek: 'He makes things achievable that otherwise wouldn't be.' Like keeping City's season alive beyond December.\n\nLet's consider the numbers. Aguero now has 16 goals in 24 career Champions League matches - a most impressive return.\n\nHe also has the best minutes per goal ratio in Premier League history, hitting the net once every 108.8 minutes.\n\nIf Aguero starts on Sunday (and he will, barring late injury), it will be his 100th Premier League appearance. Only Alan Shearer (79) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (68) have a higher tally during their first century of games than Aguero's 64.\n\nCity may have regained a bit of their old verve this week but they'll face a stern test at Southampton.\n\nWith just two defeats in 13 matches across all competitions, Ronald Koeman's team are excellent value for their second spot in the Premier League. It's not happened by accident, rather in part with a settled and consistent team.\n\nFraser Forster, Nathaniel Clyne, Jose Fonte and Ryan Bertrand are ever-presents in the league this campaign, making for an assured and reliable back line. The Saints have also made fewer substitutions than any other side.\n\nIndeed, Sunday's encounter has a feeling of irresistible force meeting immovable object. City have hit the most shots on target this season (76), while Southampton have allowed the least through (25).\n\nYet Southampton have not yet been tested like this. City are an altogether more daunting proposition but if the Saints can gain a positive result, then Koeman's claims this week that they can finish in the top four will gain even greater credence.\n\nLiverpool vs Stoke City, Barclays Premier League, Saturday 3pm\n\nHighlights on Match of the Day, BBC One at 10.20pm\n\nWoe is Brendan Rodgers and his Liverpool team right now. They just can't seem to get it right as memories of last season's title charge fade as quickly as the winter daylight.\n\nAfter four consecutive defeats, they thought they'd finally revived their fortunes out in Sofia on Wednesday night. A mini-revival but a very significant one.\n\nThen, with just a couple of minutes left on the clock, a late Ludogorets leveller and the gloom descended once more. They just couldn't see the game out - once again. They just couldn't keep their heads - once again.\n\nThe knives are really out for Liverpool at the moment. Pundits are queuing up to condemn everything from the butter fingers of Simon Mignolet and fragility of the back line to the listlessness of Steven Gerrard and uselessness of Mario Balotelli.\n\nA good time for Stoke City to visit Anfield then you would imagine as the Reds try and avoid their first four-match losing streak in the league since the winter of discontent under Gerard Houllier in 2002-03.\n\nThen again, the Potters have lost 25 of their last 29 matches in front of the Kop, failing to score in their last eight matches there.\n\nRodgers will be hoping that Mario Balotelli can return - he faces a late fitness test on that groin injury - but Rickie Lambert has done pretty well to fill the void.\n\nHe scored at Crystal Palace last weekend - inside the first 90 seconds, the only spell Liverpool actually looked effective - and then in Bulgaria, adding a maiden Champions League goal to that ridiculous long list of competitions in which he's scored (everything from the Johnstone's Paint Trophy up).\n\nOn form, Lambert should start whether Balotelli is fit or not. The Italian has not scored or assisted a single goal in 12 hours and 48 minutes on the pitch in the Premier League.\n\nIt is a funny thing, but Liverpool are still only five points off the Champions League places, despite being 12th. Stoke, meanwhile, are four points off.\n\nStoke will travel north without Victor Moses, who is set to miss up to eight weeks with a thigh injury. It remains to be seen whether he returns to parent club Chelsea for treatment.\n\nLast season's encounter at the Britannia Stadium was a thriller, with eight goals scored as Liverpool won 5-3. The ways things have been lately, it'll probably be something like that on Saturday.\n\nSunderland vs Chelsea, Barclays Premier League, Saturday 5.30pm\n\nLive on Sky Sports 1\n\nGustavo Augusto Poyet Dominguez arrived at Stamford Bridge from Real Zaragoza in the summer of 1997. He didn't cost them anything but soon became a very popular figure in Chelsea's exciting and cosmopolitan line-up of the time.\n\nHe helped them win the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1998, scored the winner in the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid three months later, and scored 14 goals from midfield as the Blues finished third in the Premiership in 1999.\n\nHe added the FA Cup the following year, the last to be played at the old Wembley and, in all, scored 49 goals in 145 appearances for the club. Not bad for a freebie, eh?\n\nOn Saturday, he becomes the latest manager to try and mastermind the victory that ends Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season. It's proving as hard as solving a Rubik's Cube while riding a motorbike with a sack over your head. Oh and you're on fire.\n\nJose Mourinho's team have shown just how good they are both at home and in Europe this week, expending no unnecessary energy in beating West Brom last weekend and then mauling Schalke 5-0 in the Champions League.\n\nWin at Sunderland and they'll lead the way by nine points on Saturday evening. If Southampton and Manchester City were to draw on Sunday, we might as well have a coronation.\n\nOminously, the Black Cats have lost 17 of their last 19 Premier League meetings with Chelsea, including the last nine at the Stadium of Light. Another one would set a new record.\n\nAny cause for optimism, then? Well, Sunderland, who were rock bottom at the time, did win 2-1 at Chelsea late last season, boosting their Great Escape attempt and fatally denting the Blues' title hopes.\n\nOther than memories of that, I suspect not.\n\nLeeds United vs Derby County, Sky Bet Championship, Saturday 3pm\n\nHighlights on the Football League Show, BBC One at 11.50pm\n\nIt was a real statement and they achieved it in style. Derby County, courtesy of fabulous strikes from Jordon Ibe and Craig Bryson, shattered Watford's unbeaten home record with a mighty impressive performance last Saturday.\n\nMore significantly, it opened up a chink of daylight at the top of the Championship table for the first time this season.\n\nHornets boss Slavisa Jokanovic admitted Derby are the strongest team in the division. Many managers have done likewise this season after being butted by the Rams.\n\nIt's that time of the year - as the leaves fall and the woolly jumper comes out from the back of the wardrobe - that the cream rises to the top in the second tier.\n\nThis time last year, Burnley, Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers occupied the top three spot - all achieved promotion.\n\n12 months earlier, it was Cardiff City and Crystal Palace who sat first and second. Again, both went up.\n\nDerby are unbeaten in their last 12 meetings with Saturday's opponents Leeds but try telling that the Steve McClaren.\n\n'The stats are irrelevant,' he retorted as he prepares to lead his team into the Elland Road bearpit.\n\n'This is a totally different game, a different situation and in different circumstances. Anything can happen.'\n\nTrue, but a Derby win is by far the most likely outcome. They have won six of their last seven on the road, while Leeds have picked up just the one win in their last 10, currently residing in 16th, two points above the relegation zone.\n\nTheir manager Neil Redfearn said: 'Playing Derby is the toughest fixture in the division at the moment. But it's a good game for us. We're an unknown quantity to them but we know we're playing well.'\n\nBrentford vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, Sky Bet Championship, Saturday 3pm\n\nHighlights on the Football League Show, BBC One at 11.50pm\n\nThey can't quite believe it in south-west London. No Brentford fan in their wildest dreams would surely have imagined they'd be fifth in the Championship at this point in the season.\n\nFour successive wins for the Bees, including that dramatic 2-1 win over rivals Fulham last Friday, have them just a point off the automatic promotion places.\n\nHaving come up last season, it's scarcely believable but Mark Warburton has done such a fantastic job and here we are.\n\nThe talk this week has been what will happen to Griffin Park should they achieve back-to-back promotions and reach the Premier League. One of those old-style grounds full of character, it wouldn't be anywhere near up to scratch, meaning they would probably have to share.\n\nBut that's for the future. The next focus is on Wolves, themselves pretty content with their return to the second division.\n\nThings are not so good at the moment, mind. After suffering a 5-0 thrashing at Derby prior to the international break, they were beaten 3-0 at home by Nottingham Forest last time out.\n\nOne man guaranteed to sparkle whatever the score is Bakary Sako. The Wolves midfielder is marking his 100th game for the club and will be wearing a custom-made pair of Nike boots covered in Swarovski crystals.\n\nThe Bees will be hoping for better luck than their meeting back in February in League One, when Wolves easily won 3-0, bringing to an end a 19-match unbeaten run.\n\nRochdale vs Oldham Athletic, Sky Bet League One, Saturday 3pm\n\nJust six miles, a couple of villages and the M62 split the Lancastrian towns of Rochdale and Oldham and their respective football clubs go head-to-head on Saturday.\n\nBoth have enjoyed good starts to the League One season and both have 27 points, sitting on the cusp of the play-off places.\n\nKeith Hill's Dale have been climbing steadily all season and showed they can mix it with the best in the division by drawing 2-2 at MK Dons last week.\n\nThey have plugged a gap this week by signing Blackpool midfielder Tomasz Cywka on loan until the New Year. Cywka, who spent a few weeks at Oldham back in 2006, will cover the injured Matthew Lund and Peter Vincenti and suspended top scorer Matty Done.\n\nHaving just come up last season, Hill is not getting ahead of himself. 'Do we want to get promoted and be in the promotion shake-up? Of course we do if it was to happen.\n\n'But we can't force it and can't suggest we're in a position to be on a promotion campaign, we're just one a retaining-League-One-status campaign.'\n\nOldham, who exited the Johnstone's Paint Trophy to Preston after a marathon penalty shoot-out in the week, have also been busy in the transfer market.\n\nGoalkeeper Neil Etheridge has departed on loan to Charlton, with manager Lee Johnson bringing in veteran Paddy Kenny from Bolton until January. While there, Oldham also acquired Tom Youngs on loan and Johnson believes the 20-year-old forward will be a 'real handful' for defences.\n\nOldham's boss is certainly looking forward to the A627(M) derby (as it is sometimes called) and 3,000 fans will be accompanying his team to Spotland.\n\nHe said: 'As a manager, I'm so excited. I've played in some good derbies myself. Bristol City and Bristol Rovers, Hearts and Hibs, they were fantastic derbies.\n\n'This for me is our biggest derby, as well as Bury, and I'm excited about it. I'm nervous as well because I know the buzz derbies create for the club. There is a lot riding on this game.'\n\nTranmere Rovers vs Portsmouth, Sky Bet League Two, Saturday 3pm\n\nThese are desperate times for Tranmere Rovers. They haven't won a league match since August 30, when the sun was still warm and hopes were high they could return to League One at the first attempt.\n\nSince then, it's been thoroughly miserable, with no win in 13 games and they host Portsmouth on Saturday six points adrift of safety.\n\nDespite an obvious need for goals, Tranmere did maintain their moral rectitude this week when chairman Mark Palios turned down the opportunity to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.\n\n'Bringing in Ched Evans would clearly have alienated a significant number of supporters,' Palios said.\n\n'It would also have inevitably embroiled the club in much controversy and distraction, at a time when we need to keep a complete focus on rebuilding the club.'\n\nPompey, meanwhile, seem to have a more stable footing these days and sit within touching distance of the play-off places.\n\nYou would imagine Saturday's trip is three points in the bag but their away record is dreadful.\n\nThey have won just once on their travels this season and that sickness is nothing new. Portsmouth have won just 21 of their 120 away trips in the league since 2009. Spare a thought for their loyal fans!\n\nWilliam Hill Scottish Cup Fourth Round, all weekend\n\nWe now have a full compliment in the Scottish Cup with the 12 Premiership teams entering the fray this weekend. A busy weekend kicks-off on Saturday lunchtime with Dundee's meeting with Aberdeen (12.15pm, BBC One Scotland).\n\nThere are three non-league sides left fighting and they all feature on Saturday afternoon. Bo'Ness United, who are based near Falkirk in the Lowlands and compete in the Scottish Junior FA East Superleague, welcome League Two Arbroath to their 7,500-capacity Newtown Park ground (1.30pm start).\n\nHighland League side Brora Rangers, whose vandalised Wikipedia entry says their manager is Sir Alex Ferguson and their Dudgeon Park ground holds 45m people, travel to Queen of the South (3pm).\n\nEdinburgh-based Spartans, reigning champions of the Lowland Football League, play Greenock Morton (3pm).\n\nThe two Glasgow giants are in action on Sunday before the TV cameras. Rangers, who look destined for second place in the Championship, host Kilmarnock at Ibrox (12.45pm, Sky Sports 2). After that, it's Hearts, who are odds-on to return to the top flight, play Celtic (3.15pm, Sky Sports 2).\n\nLa Liga, all weekend\n\nIt's been quite the week for Lionel Messi. He broke Telmo Zarra's La Liga scoring record last weekend and then smashed Raul's Champions League benchmark in midweek.\n\nNow, his task is to keep Barcelona up to pace with Real Madrid at the top of the table. Real have won their last nine and will move five clear if they win at Malaga on Saturday night (7pm, Sky Sports 5).\n\nBarcelona have to wait until Sunday night for their match and have a challenging trip to fourth-placed Valencia (8pm, Sky Sports 5).\n\nMajor League Soccer Play-offs, Saturday and Sunday\n\nIt's the business end of the MLS season in the States, with the second legs of the Conference Play-offs this weekend.\n\nOn Saturday night, in the Eastern division, the New England Revolution take a 2-1 lead into their home leg against the New York Red Bulls (Saturday 8pm, BT Sport 2). It was quite a time for the Revolution to claim their first win at Red Bull Arena as Jermaine Jones struck a late winner.\n\nIt's now up to Thierry Henry and 27-goal MLS top scorer Bradley Wright-Phillips to perform and turn it around.\n\nOver in the West, the LA Galaxy take a 1-0 lead to the Seattle Sounders (Monday 2am, BT Sport 1) after Marcelo Sarvas struck the winner in California last week.", "In the latest instalment of his weekly column, chief sports writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the sporting issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...\n\nTalking to Ferran Soriano, chief executive of Manchester City, on Sheikh Mansour's brother's yacht last weekend - just thought I'd get that one in - he advanced the probability that Chelsea's run would be curtailed by injury at some stage this season. That Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas would miss the odd game, and this would slow them down.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that Costa did not play between October 5 and November 1, in which time Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 2-1, Maribor 6-0, drew 1-1 at Manchester United and eliminated Shrewsbury Town from the Capital One Cup, there is another flaw in that argument. Couldn't the same be said of Sergio Aguero? And without Aguero, where would City be?\n\nAfter his hat-trick against Bayern Munich, that is now 17 goals in all competitions for the Manchester City striker, a phenomenal return. To put that run into perspective, his nearest colleague has four. The rest of the team put together have 21.\n\nCosta is in outstanding form for Chelsea, too, but he has six fewer goals than Aguero in four fewer appearances. Costa is averaging a goal every 0.78 games. Impressive. Aguero is up at 0.94. He is the one that needs the cotton wool wrap.\n\nEASTERN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL STADIUMS\n\nVasil Levski was a Bulgarian revolutionary and national hero from the 19th century. Executed by the Ottomans in 1873, his interest in football would have been negligible. He gave his name to a mean stadium, though.\n\nThe pitch is rubbish, the bitter cold nobody's friend but, oh, those floodlights. Oblong, intense, illuminating a monolithic, Soviet-influenced concrete bowl with a running track for the other sports, the minute you saw them, you knew you couldn't be anywhere but Eastern Europe.\n\nI can remember visiting the Dinamo Stadium, Minsk, when England played in Belarus. Dinamo is a multi-sport club founded in the Soviet Union (this is why so many teams with that name have the same badge), meaning their influence goes far beyond football. In the entrance hall of Dinamo Stadium was a plaque commemorating all of the Minsk athletes that had won gold medals at the Olympic Games. It was huge and all were celebrated equally, summer and winter. And there I found it, written in Cyrillic script, but recognisable. 1972: O. Korbut. Now that's history.\n\nNIGHT GAMES\n\nOr Night Games: Sex, Power And A Journey Into The Dark Heart Of Sport to give its full title. The winner of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year is the work of Anna Krien, an Australian writer who uses the rape trial of an Australian Rules footballer as the starting point for an exploration of sport's dangerous casual misogyny. 'Treating women like s*** shades into a culture of abuse, which in turn can shade into rape,' Krien concludes. It should be essential reading at all football clubs in the post-Ched Evans era.\n\nWhy is it that whenever a British athlete does something exceptional, his success is viewed through the prism of Sports Personality of the Year? It's a public vote, a lame popularity contest, no different to X Factor. It does not matter if Lewis Hamilton wins it or not; what he did in Abu Dhabi was exceptional. It will stand.\n\nUEFA GROUP TABLES\n\nIf you have devised a system that is so complex even you can't work it out, maybe it is time for a change. UEFA think that Manchester City are third in Group E. They're not. They're bottom. And this is why. The first method of differentiating between teams on the same points is to use their results, head to head. Roma, CSKA Moscow and Manchester City all have five points. But Roma have a better head-to-head record against Moscow, who are better head to head than City. City and Roma have yet to play their second game.\n\nSo why are City in third place? According to UEFA, alphabetical order. They don't use the head-to-head calculations until all games have been completed. So, from the top, it's R for Roma, M for Manchester City, C for CSKA Moscow. These people clearly did not watch Sesame Street. But, wait, there's more. UEFA have their official team listings in Group E as AS Roma, Manchester City and PFC CSKA Moskva. So that explains it. To be on the safe side in future, Manchester City may wish to change their name to AAAAA Manchester City. You know, like plumbers in the Yellow Pages.\n\nSOUTHAMPTON, STRANGELY\n\nPaul Mitchell, head of recruitment, has decamped for Tottenham Hotspur - a club that may be gearing up to spend two years in exile at Milton Keynes - while Morgan Schneiderlin is again talking about leaving at the end of the season. Hello? Have you lot looked at a league table lately?\n\nThe next month is going to be tough, starting with Sunday's game against Manchester City - but the biggest hindrance to Southampton's advancement right now would appear to be the doubts of those inside the club.

Look no further.\n\nThe events captured in this video from YouTube user Sloan MacK take place at a traffic light in Atlanta, Georgia. A yellow Corvette C7 is stopped at the light next to a gold metallic BMW M3. They're both flexing, waiting to jump as soon as the light turns green, though the Corvette seems a good deal more eager.\n\nThe Corvette driver fails to burn-out from the light, and sends what looks like the majority of his clutch into the atmosphere as smoke as he pulls away from the light. And then, as soon as a gentle corner comes up, the driver nearly spins-off into nowhere good. Luckily - impressively - he saves it and rolls onward. But that's about the only moderately decent bit of driving exhibited in this clip.\n\nPerhaps the Corvette driver jumped the light, or maybe the BMW's driver had a premonition of what was to come; at any rate, it's very lucky that he didn't match his speed to that of the Corvette.

Hackenberg said that the car, probably a sedan, would available \"around 2017.\"\n\nThe Tesla Model S is able to travel nearly 300 miles on a single charge -- roughly triple the range of other pure electric cars -- which has been one of its strongest selling points. An electric Audi with similar range and performance would give the Model S its first real competition.\n\nMeanwhile, BMW -- buoyed by better-than-expected sales of its new iDivision cars, the i3 electric and i8 plug-in hybrid -- is readying an advanced plug-in hybrid system, Power eDrive, to be used in its premium cars, including the 7 series sedan and X series SUVs. The system combines electric motors and gasoline engines to boost horsepower and extend range.\n\nPorsche is rumored to be developing its own all-electric Telsa competitor, a smaller version of the Panamera, which was the first luxury sedan to be offered as a plug-in hybrid model.\n\nWhen asked about the car in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter at the L.A. Auto Show last week, Porsche North America CEO Detlev von Platen denied such a car was in the works, but said that \"we are working on different derivatives [of power trains]\" and that for now the plug-in hybrid engine best suits the company's values.\n\nThe news of Audi's electric sedan came after Tesla announced that its much-delayed Model X crossover SUV would be postponed yet again, to the third quarter of 2015.\n\nTesla may find its monopoly on that market will be short-lived, too. According to Green Car Reports, Audi is developing an electric crossover SUV, the Q8, with a range of 370 miles, that would directly compete with the Model X.", "In China, master wheelman Han Yue climbed behind the wheel of his MINI 3 door hatchback and calmly set two new Guinness Book Records in front of the crowd gathered together for the \"China Drift Championship\", held at Chongqing Olympic Stadium.\n\nLet's start with the tightest parallel parking record, since videos of both feats were posted on the same day, but with this one amassing 90% more views.\n\nThe playing field is set with two MINIs spaced closely together, then we see Han come flying in, execute a handbrake turn and unbelievably drift between the two MINIs with a... wait for it.... eight centimetres clearance. That's 3.1 inches! Look down and hold your thumb and index finger apart three inches... right?!\n\nThis marks the second time Han has held this record, back in 2012 he drifted into a parking space with 15cm of space. He lost the title last summer when British driver Alastair Moffatt's July 2013 parked into an 8.6cm space, with motoring experts at the time declared would forever remain unbeatable. Han sure changed that.\n\nOne record wasn't enough though, so Han teamed up with his friend Zhang Shengjun to set a new title for most donuts in one minute around a car driving on two wheels.\n\nHan heads down a straightaway in his MINI tilted over, travelling along only on the driver's side tires. Zhang drives his BMW M4 Coupe 10 times around the MINI, and when the video cuts to inside the cabin we see maybe most impressive part, the absolute calm and nonchalance Zhang exhibits behind the wheel.\n\nAsked about his motivation to perform those stunts, Han tells Guinness Records that he wishes to bring the parallel parking record back to China, while simultaneously highlighting the world-class drivers found in his country.\n\nIt should be noted that the reason the stands are so empty is because Guinness requires the ground to be completely dry, and since the following day called for rain, Han's attempts were pushed forward one day.", "Spanish media has managed to acquire extensive details about the engines BMW will offer in the next generation 7-Series.\n\nMotor.es is citing an unknown German source who apparently shed some light about the motorization options in Bavaria's flagship model set to be offered with a standard wheelbase (G11) and long wheelbase (G12). The range will allegedly kick off with a 730i model packing a four-cylinder 2.0-liter (codenamed B48B20O0) only for the G11 in which it will develop 260 HP (191 kW).\n\nThe 740i & 740Li will get a six-cylinder turbo motor (B58B30M0) rated at 330 HP (243 kW) while the 750i & 750Li will offer an eight-cylinder (N63B44O2) with 460 HP (338 kW). The range-topping 760i & 760 Li duo will make use of a V12 6.6-liter (N74B66U1) from the Rolls-Royce Ghost and Wraith with an estimated 570 - 600 HP (419 - 441 kW) and updated for more efficiency.\n\nOn the diesel side, the report only mentions a 730d with about 272 HP (200 kW) but 740d and 750d will be offered as well. There should also be plug-in hybrid versions in the form of a 730e with approximately 275 HP (202 kW) and 740e & 740 Le rated at an estimated 400 HP (294 kW). These hybrids are expected to use a nine-speed automatic gearbox, an xDrive all-wheel drive system and offer a 37 miles (60 km) electric range in the 730e and up to 100 km (62 miles) in the 740e & 740 Le.

Until now.\n\nBy Bengt Halvorson\n\nIf you're not headed to the dealership intending to buy a brand-new Toyota Land Cruiser, you might find it quite shocking to see that it costs more than most of the Lexus lineup.\n\nWhat the Land Cruiser, as well as a lot of vehicles that might seem priced unusually high, has is a well-respected badge and a storied reputation that together command a steep premium -- and arguably, a well earned one, to those fans.\n\n\"Build a rich history like that and you also have a rich brand image, brand value, and you're willing to sell at very low volume, then you can command the price,\" said Eric Lyman, VP of industry and insights for TrueCar, and affiliated residual and resale value authority ALG.\n\nShockingly high doesn't always mean overpriced\n\nSome might see the Land Cruiser as shockingly high in its price -- more than $80,000 -- yet it's not overpriced. Looking at the very low level of discounting that happens at the dealership, as well as its top-notch resale values, it's priced just right for what it is, within the market.\n\nThat also, for the most part, applies to the Jeep Wrangler. It's a vehicle that, at $40k or more in some of its four-door Unlimited trims, seems shockingly high to those who think of it as an simple, basic truck. But there's nothing else quite like it on the market today, and with values propped up, Wrangler fans have clearly decided it's worth that.\n\n\"They might be perceived as overpriced niche products, but they have some of the highest retained value because they're niche vehicles,\" explained Lyman of the Land Cruiser and Wrangler. \"Someone who has no knowledge of the heritage isn't going to see the value of this vehicle...but someone who's followed them since they were young will want one.\"\n\nSticker shock takes on an entirely different meaning when it applies to an all-new model, like the Cadillac ELR, a model that's both shockingly high in its sticker price and definitely overpriced for the market.\n\nThe plug-in hybrid luxury coupe starts at $75,995, and blows past $83k fully loaded.\n\nFor new models, first (pricing) impressions mean everything\n\nAt present, the ELR isn't selling in the numbers anticipated. It's not even selling, significantly discounted, in the numbers already produced. Based on the rate of sale so far, U.S. dealers have a gasp-inducing year of inventory sitting around.\n\n\"It probably is the most prominent example of an overpriced car that we've seen, simply by looking at the inventory,\" said Lyman.\n\nLyman notes that getting a case like the ELR back on track is an extreme challenge for a brand. The ELR arrived just at the time when there was a recalibration in pricing for a number of electric cars and plug-in hybrids, and as gas prices weren't as big of a concern as they'd been, perhaps, when the car was being developed. Product planners also grossly misjudged the value that shoppers would place in the powertrain.\n\nIf an automaker strikes out on pricing in such a profound way, Lyman says that the best option isn't to drop the price right away, but to wait until it can give the vehicle some kind of overhaul -- then push the revamped model out under the guise of being a better car, with increased value and features, at a lower price.\n\nWill Cadillac save the ELR by repositioning it? That's something we can't yet answer, but click on to see six models that could seem very pricey if you're not tuned into the fanbase or the marketing message.\n\nCadillac ELR\n\nPrice: $75,995 (base), $83,130 (loaded) [2014]\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: Because it's more than double the price of the car it's based on, the Chevy Volt. The Cadillac ELR is a personal-luxury coupe that also packs a green-conscious plug-in hybrid powertrain, allowing you to drive in all-electric mode for nearly 40 miles before the gasoline engine cycles on. We've driven the ELR and like it, but whether Tesla comes up in the conversation or not, it's tough justifying that $40,000 premium over the Volt, which has essentially the same powertrain and with a much more useful, versatile layout.\n\nToyota Land Cruiser\n\nPrice: $81,000 (base)\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: Because it's a Toyota with an $80,000+ price tag. The Land Cruiser has been a relatively exclusive niche vehicle for decades, and with Toyota's own Sequoia SUV offering a similar-sized package and truck-based underpinnings for about $35k less, it's bound to stay that way. The Lexus LX 570 is essentially a version of the Land Cruiser with an more lavish interior and the superior dealership network and ownership experience, and it starts at less than a $3,000 premium to the Land Cruiser, but that's meaningless to most Land Cruiser buyers, who want one based on the hard-earned, long-running heritage of the badge.\n\nNissan 370Z Roadster\n\nPrice: $50,225 (Touring Sport Automatic)\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: Haven't we been here before? The Nissan 370Z 'returned' in to the market 12 years ago to a market position that was supposed to break free of the lower-sales, higher-price territory that eventually doomed its 300ZX predecessor. We're curious to see if Nissan goes back to basics with the next-generation 'Z' because it's again become a quite expensive grand-touring machine in some trims -- while lacking the refinement that should come with such a price tag, we think. 370Z sales have dropped on a year-over-year basis for four consecutive years, up to this past year, as well -- another indication that a new pricing strategy might work.\n\nVolkswagen Touareg\n\nPrice: $45,480 (base); $62,345 (TDI Executive)\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: Because it's priced $10k or more above comparably sized, comparably equipped crossovers. The VW Toureg has been arguably misunderstood since day one, and that's part of the reason why there's a more affordable mid-size crossover on the way next year. Volkswagen's upscale SUV starts at $45,480 for its base V-6 gasoline model, but the models that are more shocking are the higher-trim versions with TDI diesel and hybrid powertrains under the hood. The Touareg Hybrid starts at $65,655 -- more than $10k above the price of a top-of-the-line Audi Q7 TDI Prestige, or an Audi Q5 Hybrid.\n\nMini Cooper Countryman JCW ALL4\n\nPrice: $36,200 (base); $47,650 (fully optioned); $60,099 (loaded with official accessories)\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: It underscores how inflated MINI pricing can be -- even next to luxury counterpart BMW We have trouble understanding, or stomaching, the price tag on this top-of-the-line member of the 2015 MINI Cooper lineup. Load it up with the works (City Pack, Cold Weather Package, Technology Package, panoramic sunroof, navigation), and the bottom-line price adds up to $47,650, according to MINI's consumer site. That's already within a couple grand of the Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG. And when we outfitted it with what we'd consider a perfectly reasonable set of MINI accessories (including the extra-cost JCW aero kit and trim, black driving lamps, a roof basket and bike carrier), we ran the price up to an absolutely insane $60,099.\n\nJeep Wrangler Unlimited\n\nPrice: $40,890 (Rubicon Hard Rock)\n\nWhy it's shockingly high: Because it's a Wrangler, and aren't they simple and a little crude? Yes, we do remember when the Jeep Wrangler seemed quite affordable. But in recent years its prices have crept up. And perhaps emboldening Jeep's pricing strategy is that, with the Hummer H3 long gone and the Toyota FJ now discontinued, it's the only pick for those who want the iconic, retro-styled Wrangler -- and not a luxury-badged vehicle that might look out of place dusty and dirty.\n\nFor 2015, the Wrangler Unlimited Hard Rock edition, optioned with the automatic transmission and items like the body-color hard top, tow package, the lower axle ratio, Uconnect infotainment, front seat side airbags (yes, they're optional), and automatic climate control, altogether nudges $47k. Make some accessory choices and you could hit the $50k ceiling. It's steep, but to serious off-road enthusiasts, the Wrangler's worth it.\n\nThis story originally appeared at The Car Connection", "There may soon be more women in power positions in the world of German business under a proposed law from Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government. If passed, the law would force large, publicly traded corporations to have female members make up at least 30 percent of their supervisory boards (which are responsible in part for business strategy) by 2016. In addition, all companies would have to increase the female proportion on their management boards, which conduct regular business.\n\nThe law seems likely to pass next month. \"We've decided to do this and it will happen,\" said Merkel in a speech about the new rule, according to Bloomberg. Women currently have just six percent of management board seats in the country.\n\nBig businesses in the country aren't on board with proposed law, including automakers. \"BMW as a company doesn't believe in quotas,\" said spokesperson Jochen Frey to Bloomberg. \"While we hold that opinion, we want and strive for diversity in our workforce in terms of gender, ethnicity and age.\" Currently, 25 percent of Bimmer's supervisory board is female, a bit higher than the national average in Germany of 22 percent.\n\nGerman car companies are hardly alone when it comes to having a paucity of women in positions of power. Honda only added its first female member to the automaker's board of directors earlier this year, and Toyota and Nissan showed similarly low numbers. A 2013 list from Fortune ranked many of the most powerful women in the auto industry as coming from North America.", "I'm getting ready to go on vacation and I'm going to be driving our Supercharged Infiniti for about 9 hours and I noticed the damned replaced windshield is chipped again. My new Jaguar has also had its windshield replaced once as has my older one and both of them are showing a lot of little chips which get really annoying when the sun is coming up or going down. Gorilla Glass, now coming out in its third even harder form, is used in most expensive smartphones because it is so tough and while Apple looked to replace it with Sapphire they just couldn't manufacture it reliably and it turned out to be way to brittle for a bendable phone. Though I think it's likely it is too brittle for any big phone because all of the large ones flex a little.\n\nNow Gorilla Glass is used in the amazing new i8 but only in the panel between the engine and passenger compartment because, on top of being stronger, it also does a better job of blocking sound.\n\nRelated: ISIS orders 100,000 Takata airbags\n\nGorilla Glass Windshield\n\nI figured that someone must sell a windshield made of Gorilla glass and I'd pay extra for one I didn't have to replace so often. I ran into this video by the guys that do the Myth Busters TV show and in the second half they showcase how much better a windshield with only one layer of the glass would be. If hit by a large object the windshield, which had the gorilla glass on the inside, didn't spray glass into the eyes of the folks in the front seats. Now that would be an impressive value but I wonder why they put it on outside given it should resist chipping much better though, granted, you'd be back to having the risk of glass shards on the inside.\n\nOk then why not create a windshield that was entirely made of gorilla glass? Likely because it would be too expensive but you'd think companies like Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, and Rolls Royce (not to mention the super car companies) could likely market the advantages and justify the cost.\n\nNow they wouldn't just justify it on safety (suddenly I'm wondering why I didn't think of Aston Martin because James Bond would definitely go for this option) but on its other benefits. It's much lighter, it is (as BMW discovered) better at deadening sound, and it is more flexible. This last makes it not only more resistant to chips and safety hazards but much harder to break through keeping the car's contents much safer. Something else a much more expensive luxury or performance car might want.\n\nRelated: More woes for GM - two dead in iPhone explosion\n\nWrapping Up: The Glass Age\n\nWhile I was watching the video on the Gorilla Glass Windshield I noticed another one that introduced \"The Glass Age\", it is a follow on to one of my favorite videos \"A Day Made of Glass\". In this video buildings, tables, walls, and tablets are made of transparent glass that transforms to show information, protect our privacy, and transform the world into an ever more visual place. They are cool videos that showcase to a large extent what we'll likely see more of next decade and I think we've only scratched the surface with regard to what glass will be able to do now that we can bend it and make in nearly impossible to break.\n\nI'm still looking forward to the time when our views can be dynamically changed to reflect any place in the universe real or imagined. Wake up in the morning to grazing horses or unicorns, an ocean or Martian view, or the world as it did or will exist. At some point we'll break free of reality and glass technology will be at the heart of getting us there. Granted, right now, I'd just be happy if my next windshield didn't need to be replaced quite so often.", "German tuner AC Schnitzer was in charge of turning the BMW X4 into a police car as part of the TUNE IT! SAFE! Initiative by the Association of German Vehicle Tuners.\n\nIt's actually their fourth vehicle of this kind after the 2009 BMW 123d Coupe, 2010 MINI E and last year's BMW 428i Coupe. For 2014 they focused on the BMW X4 in the 20i guise and they bumped output of the four-cylinder 2.0-liter turbo engine from 184 HP (135 kW) to 245 HP (180 kW). Thanks to these changes, the X4 now runs the 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) sprint in 6.7 seconds while the 50-112 mph (80-180 km/h) sprint is done in 17.5 seconds before hitting a top speed of 132 mph (212 km/h).\n\nAside from the police livery and power bump, AC Schnitzer has installed an aerodynamic body kit, 22-inch anthracite alloys with 265/30 R22 Hankook Ventus S1evo tires and a custom suspension spring kit lowering the crossover by 30mm front & 25mm rear.

After a reveal in London in September, the XE is headed for its first auto-show appearance at the 2014 Paris motor show.\n\nMORE: Read our 2017 Jaguar XE preview\n\nIn size and mission, the XE is a rival for BMW's 3-Series, down to the familiar echoes that follow the Jag's roofline. But the Cadillac ATS is a worthy rival, and so is the new Mercedes-Benz C-Class--and a new Audi A4 is due, too.\n\nThe XE is built on a new modular aluminum architecture that should see wide adoption within Jaguar Land Rover. The company currently builds its larger vehicles, the XJ and Range Rover, on their own dedicated aluminum chassis, but a modular architecture underpinning this small model likely means cars like the next-generation XF will adopt the all-aluminum concept as well. The aluminum body reduces weight which in turn boosts fuel economy and performance.\n\nJaguar has clearly looked to the BMW archetype for the styling of the new XE and for its fundamentals--it promises a true sport sedan, crafted from aluminum for light weight, with rear-wheel drive and at launch, a supercharged six-cylinder engine.\n\nThe BMW influences are clearest in the Jaguar XE's sideview, where it might do a better job even than the 3-Series in summing up the customary sport-sedan look. It's better here, through the kinked roofline, the F-Type-alike tail, and in the pronounced Jaguar nose, decorated on the supercharged S model with a mesh grille and big air intakes. The bling is kept in check, save for chromed fender vents and 20-inch wheels--all the better to play up its low 0.26 coefficient of drag.\n\nThe cabin is trimmed in a choice of aluminum, wood, or piano-black, and dials up a suitably sporty looks that's not as glitzy as the cockpits of the big XJ and XF sedans. A rotary transmission control dominates the center console, and gauges styled like those on the F-Type are framed by a thick steering wheel.\n\nIn the XE, the body forms around what Jaguar describes as a long wheelbase and a low seating position. With luck, the interior space will net out larger than today's steel-bodied, slim-fitting XF. Jaguar does promise generous head and leg room in the XE, indirectly confessing to some of the XF's shortcomings.\n\nFrom launch, we expect to see the XE S, which uses Jaguar's supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, making 340 hp and 332 pound-feet of torque in this application. The sole transmission will be a ZF-sourced paddle-shifted eight-speed automatic. Jaguar claims a 0-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds in this model, with top speed limited to 155 mph. Jaguar recently announced a new family of turbocharged four-cylinders, called Ingenium, which should arrive here in gas and possibly diesel versions, with either manual or dual-clutch auto transmissions. EPA fuel economy hasn't been announced for the XE S, but you can bet it will be competitive with BMW's 335i sedan.\n\nUnder the aluminum skin, the Jaguar XE will ride on a double-wishbone front suspension partly composed from aluminum, while the rear suspension will be a multi-link setup. Electric power steering will be a Jaguar first when it makes its debut in the XE.\n\nAside from its stiff, aerospace-inspired body structure, the XE will depend on new active and passive safety equipment to provide state of the art protection. Along with the usual airbags and stability control, the XE will offer a new traction-control system that uses sensors to determine power application below 19 mph for better launches. Other safety features will include adaptive cruise, blind-spot monitors, parking assist, a laser-projected head-up display, and an autonomous braking system that uses stereo cameras for obstacle detection.\n\nJaguar has finally given its aging infotainment suite a complete overhaul, and the XE will be one of the first recipients of the InControl system. It combines the usual items -- USB connectivity, audio and voice streaming over Bluetooth, navigation using SD-card mapping data, and connectivity features like mobile hotspot capability. There is also an InControl remote app that lets drivers perform some functions from their smartphone, such as remote starting and locking or unlocking the vehicle.", "From The Car Connection:\n\n2015 Audi A3 Review\n\nWith the 2015 A3 and S3, Audi has a new entry-level family of cars that completes a circle.

At the time I thought he was a madman, or maybe a moron. Maybe I was the moron.\n\nThere is a brilliant stand-up sketch by the British comedian Peter Kay in which he explores the young mind's propensity to mis-hear song lyrics.\n\nI defy anyone to watch it and not nod in concurrence as S-Express repeats on your adult brain - were they really singing about Audi Quattros? Pre or post Torsen differential? 10 or 20 valve?\n\nI am beginning to feel the way about car design and styling. I mention both criteria because I was once carefully lectured by someone very designer-like and much cleverer than me on the distinction between the two but can't for the life of me remember which was which. I think I asked if the car would slide.\n\nMy inner luddite likes to categorize both styling and design as 'how stuff looks.' The pertinence here is not one how one defines the meaning 'good looking,' but the tense in which it is used - I am increasingly looking at cars I once found repellent and thinking them attractive in 2014, and vice-versa. Did I just not see things properly back then? Please tell me the same is true for you?\n\nAnd now this has happened: I am increasingly looking at the work of Chris Bangle, supposedly the slayer of attractive BMW's, and thinking he might have been a genius.\n\nBefore I became so drunk that the asparagus mouse exited the way it had entered, I once listened to Chris Bangle deliver an after-dinner speech about cars, and the industry that produces them. It was the most lucid, percipient talk of its type I've ever heard - well, at least I remember thinking that before I blew chunks. I also recall him repeatedly using the word 'paradigm' in the most unctuous way possible. A joyous kind of pre-orgasm holler of the lets-change-every-established-rule type.\n\nAt the time, or at least in the build-up to that evening, I thought Chris Bangle was at best a madman, at worst a criminal. He'd taken the finest mainstream design language of them all -- the demure yet purposeful BMW saloon -- and sodomized it with a special brutality. When we saw the E65 7 Series we could barely contain the contents of our stomachs. He parried the criticism by insisting that BMW needed a new direction and that only a complete schism with the past would provide suitable change. So he went bat-shit-crazy with the Seven. Which looked terrible in 2001. And which now, especially the facelifted model, so-help-me-Lord, looks pretty damn good to my eyes.\n\nThe Houdinery deepened with the 2003 E60 5-Series. Born with a face for radio, I thought it was a crime against Bavaria - gone was the Hoffmeister kink, gone was the driver-slanted centre console, gone was all the BMW DNA; incoming was 'flame surfacing.' I interviewed Burkhard G\u00f6schel just weeks before he left the company and he laughed demonically about the situation: \"What do you think of our flame surfacing, hohoho-hahahahaHAHAHAHA.\" he asked, shaking his head in mock disapproval -- his not knowing what to think confusing me into not knowing what to think either.\n\nA BMW board member as perplexed by BMW's design language as the rest of the planet in 2004.\n\nThere are some brilliant stories about Bangle's legendary ability to create an evangelical following among his staff and team - perhaps even the board of BMW. Go and look at a first generation Bangle-BMW Z4, then spy the previous Z3 and tell me how the hell he managed to get that past the suits. He must have spiked a few drinks. Like so many Bangle shapes, it's looking really quite good now. My favourite completely non-verified tale involves the sign-off for the E63 6-Series. It is alleged that several different design proposals were considered and after some tantric downtime in a green spot, he randomly chose the one we have now. I have no idea if this is true or not, but I sincerely hope it is. Guess what? The E63 6-Series is looking very cool these days. Especially as an M6.\n\nThere's a black E61 550i Sport Touring that must live near me and with every passing week the creases in the flanks seem cleverer and the overall proportions quite perfect for a car of its type. The Sport moniker is important though - Bangle clearly wasn't a simple aesthete - I can't speak for BMW USA, but the model mix between SE and Sport on an E39 5 Series (the previous model) was nothing like what it became for the E60/61. He was clearly also a hard-nosed businessman. I like to think he deliberately made a whole generation of BMW's completely unpalatable to the human eye unless they were specified with expensive bodykits and alloy wheels.\n\nHe was a greedy, marketing-savvy aesthete; that's my kind of bounty-hunter.\n\nAnd of course only now are people beginning to copy those Bangle tricks - the complicated, seemingly nonsensical shapes. The flame-surfacing, the abstraction - but most of all the sense that evolutionary styling changes over time might always leave a brand unable to progress.\n\nThis is why Chris Bangle was right and we were wrong: because his brand revolution now resonates outside the car-world, and that is unusual. Normally the car industry copies ideas from other, more radical corners of the industrial map, but in the paradigm shifts being undertaken by so many famous brands you see the Bangle effect.\n\nThe current BMW range looks superb, bar the frumpy Seven, but it does so because of the clever merging of a classic BMW-ness and some residual Bangle irregularity that catches the eye when you least expect it. And makes you grin. Perversely, BMW couldn't have found such comfort with its current styling if it hadn't let that Bangle-man loose with the crown jewels until 2009.", "Typically, when full-line car companies set out to develop a coupe, they start with a sedan from the current lineup, trim two doors, and rewrap the package in a sleeker body. A shorter wheelbase is optional. Lexus rolled up that memo and burned it before going to work on the RC. Instead, to form its new coupe's structure, Lexus combined the front clip of the GS sedan, the center section of the old IS C convertible, and the rear end of the IS sedan, using adhesives and welding and a fancy technique called laser screw welding, which allows for more frequent tacks and thus greater rigidity.\n\nThe three-piece approach makes more sense once it's explained. The GS front gives engineers the extra track width they wanted for handling. They deemed the IS rear sufficient to keep the car's dimensions tidy, and the IS C center section necessary for its inherent stiffness and shorter wheelbase. Compared with the current IS sedan, the RC coupe is roughly 1.5 inches longer, wider, and lower, but with a 2.7-inch shorter wheelbase.\n\nThe RC F we have here is the hot-rod version of the RC, and the car Lexus is using to effectively replace its IS F sedan, which does not have an analogue in this new IS generation. (Lexus's hi-po four-door will be the GS F, bigger and likely more expensive than the old M3-baiting IS F.) But the RC F is not trying to be a direct BMW M-whatever knockoff; it has its own thing going. The snug cockpit swaddles the driver with information and controls in what seems like an appropriate techno-modern, Tokyo-by-night design scheme. A high center console features an optional touchpad that is part of the $2840 navigation and up\u00adgraded stereo package, and the instruments showcase a morphing LCD center tach, similar to the LFA's. Nearly everything in the car can be adjusted with the haptic infotainment control pad, but there are also redundant buttons with knobs for volume and tuning, just as in the current IS.\n\nThe LCD tach changes its appearance between the four drive modes (eco, normal, sport, and sport plus) and is flanked by another screen on the left, which displays tire pressures, radio stations, g-forces, and just about everything else. A smaller analog speedometer lies to the right.\n\nThere are few occasions in life when we'd say that 467 horsepower isn't enough. This is one of them. While the IS F's old 5.0-liter V-8 got thoroughly overhauled for this new RC F, the car weighs 4048 pounds, 200-plus more than the old sedan.\n\nMass is the RC F's millstone. It has 400 pounds on a BMW M4 and weighs as much as the four-wheel-drive Audi RS5. In a three-way drag race, the Bimmer walks away, with the F and RS5 keeping pace through the quarter-mile. By 130 mph, the RC F has eked out a nearly two-second lead on the RS5. Keep your foot in it and a governor abruptly halts acceleration at 171 mph.\n\nWith all the data crunched, the RC F proves no quicker than the old IS F. Nor is it slower, though. We recorded a 4.3-second zero-to-60 and a quarter-mile time of 12.8 seconds, identical to a 2008 IS F. Identical, too, is the naturally aspirated V-8 wail. While muted in the cabin, pedestrians will flinch when the intake's noise flap opens and the camshaft timing changes the engine's rumble into a sweaty roar.\n\nLexus gets credit for adding 51 horsepower to the V-8 with something more than a software update and without resorting to forced induction (cough, cough, BMW). Titanium valves, all 32 of them, along with a lighter crankshaft and con-rods, allowed engineers to lift the redline by 500 rpm to 7300. Only the 8300-rpm Audi RS5 can rival the F for aural gratification; the M4's turbocharged and overly enhanced soundtrack is no match. If only the RC F were quicker for it.", "Germany's BMW is not interested in buying a stake in U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Motors, German weekly WirtschaftsWoche reported on Friday, citing a BMW statement.

The Herald was present at the moment the two men, one of whom is wanted by gardai in Louth for armed robbery, tried to flee when they approached the checkpoint at Leighlinbridge at 8.40pm.\n\nWhen officers quizzed the driver of the 2010 BMW regarding his driving licence, he immediately drove off at speed. Armed gardai gave chase as the pursuit continued on a maze of rural roads. The stolen car was fitted with false registration plates and reached speeds of 200kmph.\n\nGarda Liam Lawlor from Carlow traffic corps assisted by Gda Paul Hogan arrested the two men in Clara, Co Kilkenny following a terrifying 15-minute chase through Gowran, Paulstown, before it ended in Clara. The arrested men were being held in Carlow garda station last night.\n\nThe overt operation will continue to until at least Christmas with the aim of tackling burglary gangs head-on.\n\nA core group of up to 10 family-based mobs are involved in the crime wave that has targeted vulnerable rural homes and used the country's motorway system to make rapid getaways. The gangs, who use high-powered cars that often speed away from garda vehicles, are mostly Dublin-based and are made up of Traveller or Romanian criminals.\n\nMost of the criminals are based in the Tallaght area of southwest Dublin but some also have addresses in other parts of the capital, including Rathfarnham, Dun Laoghaire and Shankill. It is estimated that more than 300 criminals are involved in the gangs.\n\nThe armed garda officers are being dispatched to slip-roads on the motorway system as well as secondary routes both northbound and southbound to and from the Dublin area.\n\nA vast stretch of countryside from Gorey, Co Wexford, in the east and west to Thurles, Co Tipperary, is the focus of the operation. Gardai have established key information about the structures of these gangs.\n\nThe criminals have been using their connections in towns where they have \"family hubs\" to gather local intelligence on burglary targets.\n\nAmong the towns identified where this issue is most prevalent are two in Tipperary and one in Wexford.\n\nA major part of the operation is the use of spy technology involving registration-plate recognition software hooked up to a database of cars associated with the crimewave, which is known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition. If a car linked to previous burglaries or crime is spotted entering the area, gardai send out an alert to other officers in the vicinity.\n\n\"This is a massive ongoing operation in which local gardai, both in plain clothes and uniform are assisted by national units including the Organised Crime Unit and the Air Support Unit every day and night,\" a source told the Herald. \"Customs and Revenue are also playing their part by carrying out checks for laundered diesel at these stops.\"\n\nWhile noting the arrests and car seizures that have taken place in the past week, the intelligence gathered so far has been described as \"perhaps of even more importance\" and will lead to a large number of arrests in the very near future.\n\n\"This is being run as part of Operation Fiacla and the ultimate hope is that it will lead these gangs to realise that the country's motorway system is no longer easy pickings for these crews,\" the source added.\n\n\"Law-abiding people have nothing to fear about these armed checkpoints and, in fact, crime prevention advice in relation to burglaries and similar crimes is given to ordinary people by community gardai when they are stopped as well,\" a source explained.\n\nThe gardai set up Operation Fiacla to combat the burglary gangs and more than 10,500 people have been arrested in just over two years since it was launched.\n\nMore than 6,200 people have been charged with offences in the 29 months since it began.", "A Tucson-based motorcycle company aided by former police officers is becoming a contender in the law enforcement motorcycle industry, competing against large-scale manufacturers, such as BMW and Harley-Davidson.\n\nVictory Police Motorcycles, which employs 12 people locally, operates out of a property at 1400 S. Alvernon Way, where the motorcycles are designed, manufactured, assembled and serviced. It contracts with 70 law enforcement agencies worldwide, 54 of which are in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe custom motorcycles are built specifically for each law enforcement agency's needs, said Kenny Vaughan\ufeff, a training instructor for Victory Motorcycle and a retired motorcycle officer of 28 years with the Tucson Police Department. Victory Police Motorcycles took input from more than 4,100 surveys that asked about the officers' preferences and past injuries to design the ideal motorcycle.\n\n\"They tell us what they want and we start putting them together,\" he said.\n\nThe Victory design is longer and heavier than most police motorcycles to increase safety and comfort and accommodate more storage for police equipment, including computers, radars and firearms, he said. Another feature, not common among other police motorcycle designs, is the floorboards, which move according to the officers' feet motion.\n\nFormer traffic officers and motor instructors, such as Vaughan, were involved in the development of the Victory motorcycles' design, he said. The idea began with a group of motorcycle officers with personal Victory bikes wanting to build the ideal police motorcycle.\n\nThe first police motorcycle was built in 2007 and the company officially launched in 2008, alongside the pre-existing Arizona Victory Motorcycles, its retail sister company.\n\nVictory Police Motorcycles, whose parent company is Polaris Industries, is a one-stop shop, said Mike Schultz\ufeff, sales director. Adding police-specific devices like radar or radio are also done in Tucson, and each motorcycle has a color-coded electrical system.\n\n\"We're the 911 of police motorcycles,\" he said. The company modeled its service after the 911 dispatch system, where customers have just one number to call to fix various issues with their motorcycles, whether it is a wiring issue, need for replacement parts or adding a component.\n\nSince its launch, the company has entered the international market, selling police motorcycles to agencies in Indonesia, South Africa, Sweden, China and Canada. Schultz said Victory's success is not a result of a vigorous marketing campaign but rather, word of mouth among police organizations.\n\nIn the Tucson area, the Marana Police Department and Oro Valley Police Department have acquired Victory police motorcycles.\n\nMarana police purchased two bikes with a grant from the Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety two years ago, according to police spokesman Sgt. Chris Warren\ufeff. Since then, it has purchased an additional two.\n\nWarren said Marana police chose Victory models after researching and testing various motorcycles. Some of the contributing factors were cost-savings and the fact that Victory motorcycles were American-made.\n\nHaving the builder \"right in our backyard\" is a huge benefit, said Marana Officer Brad Clifford\ufeff, who was stopping by Victory Police Motorcycles for maintenance earlier this week.\n\n\"It's so much safer to ride,\" he added, saying that injuries for motorcycle officers are \"not like in the past.\"\n\nThe Marana Police Department was recognized at the 2014 COPSWEST expo, a convention put on by the California Peace Officers' Association, for \"best motorcycle design\" with its flat-black Victory motorcycles.\n\nThe Oro Valley Police Department also acquired eight Victory motorcycles in August.\n\nThe department replaced its \"aging fleet\" of BMW motorcycles, which had high service costs, said Lt. Chris Olson\ufeff, special operations bureau lieutenant. One of eight Victory motorcycles was purchased for the department by the Office of Highway Safety and seven of them are leased from the company, he added.", "Kai Wolf (Foto), 34, steigt in den Vorstand der Scholz & Friends Group auf und wird zum 1.

Since the premiere of the first four-wheel drive BMW 325i in 1985, BMW has consistently expanded its four-wheel drive competence with new models and constant further development in the field of drive technology. One of the milestones is undoubtedly the intelligent four-wheel drive system BMW xDrive, which was first used in the BMW X3 and the X5 in 2004 and is now available for numerous models and series. Even at that time, engineers did not focus solely on improving traction and vehicle stability. In addition to a high degree of functionality and enhanced cornering dynamics, the minimisation of system-related losses and constant weight reduction are top priorities set to keep the fuel consumption and emission levels of four-wheel drive vehicles as low as possible. To this end, the intelligent four-wheel drive system BMW xDrive is always aligned to each vehicle concept (Sedan/Coupe, SAV, SAC) with the aim of implementing the optimum solution.\n\nPremiere: BMW xDrive complements front-wheel drive concept.\n\nThe latest example of model-specific alignment of the four-wheel drive system is provided by the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. The fundamental difference to previous variants is that, for the first time, BMW xDrive is premised on a front-wheel drive concept with transversally installed engines. The Active Tourer has already proven that front-wheel drive technology fully meets the brand's demands in terms of driving dynamics. This is largely owed to the new range of modularly constructed three- and four-cylinder engines which, thanks to state-of-the-art TwinPower Turbo technology, excel to an equal extent through high performance characteristics and outstanding efficiency. With the BMW 225i xDrive Active Tourer (fuel consumption combined: 6,5-6,4 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 152-148 g/km)* and the BMW 220d xDrive Active Tourer (fuel consumption combined: 4,8-4,6 l/100km; CO2 emissions combined: 127-122 g/km)*, the intelligent four-wheel drive system is now available for top-of-the-range power units to further improve traction, vehicle stability and cornering dynamics, with the aim of enhancing safety and driving pleasure. Both models feature BMW xDrive as standard in combination with the 8-speed Steptronic transmission.\n\nSlender, lightweight four-wheel architecture.\n\nThe slender architecture featuring compact, lightweight components and the resulting low amount of space required by the new four-wheel drive system are excellently suited to the concept of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. Thus the additional weight of the entire four-wheel drive technology is only around 61 kg. Furthermore, measures for reducing system-related losses and an energy-efficient operating strategy ensure extremely favourable fuel consumption and emission levels.\n\nPower from the front drive to the rear axle is transferred by means of an angular gear (Power Take-Off) on the front differential and a two-part cardan shaft. The central component of the four-wheel drive system is an electro-hydraulically controlled multiple-disk clutch (Hang-On) inside the rear axle drive, which facilitates infinitely variable distribution of torque to the front and rear wheels. The corresponding commands are provided by an electronic control unit which, like the hydraulic pump, is located on the rear axle.\n\nPower Take-Off: angular gear and two-part cardan shaft.\n\nThe angular gear is mounted behind the engine on the automatic transmission and crankcase. The input shaft is a hollow shaft construction and directly connected to the front axle differential. In this way, part of the drive force is transferred from the differential basket to the cardan shaft via the hollow shaft, the crown wheel and the pinion shaft. The angular gear operates at a fixed gear ratio (1:1.74) and is permanently engaged, meaning that the cardan shaft always rotates when the vehicle is driven. Reversal of transmission takes place in the rear axle drive so that the front and rear axle drive shafts both rotate at exactly the same speed.\n\nHang-On: electro-hydraulically controlled multiple-disk clutch.\n\nThe multiple-disk clutch located in the rear axle drive (Hang-On) directs a proportion of torque to the rear wheels according to each driving situation, thus ensuring variable power distribution between the front and rear axle as required. In extreme cases (e.g. the front wheels are standing on ice), the ratio can be 0:100. The required operating pressure (0 to 40 bar) is delivered by an electro-hydraulic pump, the speed of which is defined by a pulse-width-modulated signal from the electronic control unit. Pressure is not measured by a sensor, but extremely accurately by means of voltage and power alignment. In order to ensure maximum positioning accuracy, run-in behaviour and temperature influences are independently compensated, the system constantly adapting to ever changing operating conditions.\n\nEfficient valve helps reduce fuel consumption.\n\nMoreover, xDrive utilises an energy-efficient operating strategy: When four-wheel drive is not required - which is usually the case in day-to-day operation - the pump is deactivated, rendering the system unpressurised. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is then driven only via the front wheels. In order to make use of additional saving potentials, BMW has provided the multiple-disk clutch with a spring-loaded Efficient valve, which lowers the oil level in the clutch and significantly reduces friction losses (oil splash losses). When required, the system takes only fractions of a second to build up maximum operating pressure in the Efficient mode and thus deliver maximum torque to the rear wheels. This intervention goes unnoticed by the driver and passengers and without any losses in traction.\n\nIntelligent networking: fast, precise and proactive.\n\nIn order to guarantee efficient and constant power distribution to the front and rear axle as required, the four-wheel drive system is managed from the control unit of the Dynamic Stability Control feature (DSC). In order to analyse each driving situation, DSC analyses a large amount of data providing information on each respective running condition and ensuring optimum distribution of drive torque. This information includes vehicle speed, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, steering angle, wheel speed, longitudinal inclination, accelerator position and the setup via Driving Experience Control. Furthermore, the DSC status, including Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), Electronic Differential Lock Control (EDLC) and Performance Control is taken into account. Adjustment of the four-wheel drive system to the ever changing driving and road conditions is performed - in typical BMW xDrive manner - within fractions of a second, thus guaranteeing consistently neutral and safe handling even in difficult conditions. Nevertheless, the variable distribution of power between the two axles goes virtually unnoticed by the driver. Also, within the framework of the efficient operating strategy, torque distribution is precisely regulated as to avoid any loss of power due to wheel spin.\n\nBMW xDrive: maximum traction, enhanced cornering dynamics.\n\nThanks to DSC networking, any imminent wheel slip for example can be detected at an early stage. Through precise distribution of drive torque this situation can be anticipated and avoided. If for instance the vehicle threatens to drift outwards over the front wheels, increased tractive force is supplied to the rear axle, allowing the vehicle to turn in more accurately. On the other hand, xDrive directs excess force to the front wheels, should the rear of the vehicle threaten to swerve outwards. As a result, maximum four-wheel performance is available even before slippage occurs. Therefore, xDrive featured in the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer not only ensures best possible traction and safety in adverse road conditions, but also enhances vehicle stability, cornering dynamics and ride comfort. In driving situations where the interconnection of all four wheels is disadvantageous - i.e. in an emergency stop - the system opens the multiple-disk clutch completely within milliseconds.\n\nOnly if optimum power distribution to the front and rear axle is not sufficient to keep the Active Tourer on the desired course, DSC intervenes by reducing engine output and/or by decelerating individual wheels. Moreover, DSC assumes the function of a transverse differential lock: If a wheel spins without transferring power, it is automatically slowed down, whereby the axle differential directs more power to the wheel opposite.\n\n* Fuel consumption figures were calculated on the basis of the ECE test cycle, depending on tyre format.", "In the most recent episode of HBO's Newsroom, there's a scene in which a high-level EPA administrator appears on television to discuss a report about carbon dioxide levels in Hawaii. The report was real, but fortunately, the apocalyptic proclamation by the fictionalized Richard Westbrook -- \"The last time there was this much CO2 in the air, the oceans were 80 feet higher than they are now\" -- doesn't mean that today's Earth necessarily will find itself deep underwater in the near future. In fact, by piecing together a series of seemingly unrelated threads, there's a case to be made that 2014 will be remembered as a critical year in the decarbonization of the global economy. Sound unbelievable? Tie these eight stories together and see if the resulting crazy quilt doesn't look like something significant.\n\n1) Oil prices collapse\n\nAt first glance, this is a devastating blow to reducing carbon consumption. When a good becomes less expensive we tend to use more of it -- not less. And the fall in gas prices has already led to an uptick in SUV and truck sales. But a funny thing happened on the way to the F-150: Nissan continues to set records for sales of its all-electric Leaf and Tesla Motors also is having its best year. Sales of fuel-efficient, affordable vehicles like the Honda Fit also continue to rise sharply.\n\nWhile the auto sector produces mixed news, its worth understanding what's leading to the price collapse in the first place. A slowing global economy has reduced demand for oil, which means less is being burned. And the world's fastest-growing producer, the United States, has found most of its new supply from hydraulic fracturing techniques, aka fracking. The same technology that has boosted the oil patch in the U.S. has led to a massive expansion of natural gas supply and usage. In turn, coal is disappearing from the scene in this country. On the twisty road to cleaner, more renewable energy natural gas trumps coal and we only have it thanks to the kind of activity that's crushing oil prices. While those lower prices will make weaning ourselves off of gas-powered cars more challenging, there is hope....\n\n2) The era of the carbon tax may have arrived\n\nFar and away the most straightforward method for reducing carbon emissions is to tax them. But Americans, understandably, are reluctant to accept any additional tax burdens, especially as many are still feeling the effects of the worst recession in generations. If, however, there was a way to make sure any new tax on carbon was offset dollar for dollar elsewhere, the potential of a win-win becomes real. Take for example the tax on hiring new workers that's imposed by Social Security. What if that could be lowered using proceeds from a carbon tax?\n\nBob Inglis, a former South Carolina congressman who favors the idea, told National Geographic he thinks the politics could possibly work. The timing would have to be just right, perhaps after the 2106 presidential election, but the appeal of a broad-based tax cut should be strong. Inglis also thinks there's some real meat here to conservatives. A number of EPA rules could go by the wayside if a mechanism was in place to reduce carbon over time via taxation. Simpler rules equals less government. Ian Adams of the R Street Institute expressed similar sentiments in The Oregonian: \"This could be done while simultaneously complying with the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions in a much less economically destructive way,\" he wrote.\n\nRight now, these conservative voices are just a few, but they make a great deal of sense. With Republicans in firm control of Congress, perhaps their concept of shrinking government will ultimately come around to the ideas of Inglis and Adams.\n\n3) The China syndrome\n\nOne thing that has changed on the political landscape is that it's no longer so easy to claim the U.S. should ignore carbon emissions because, well, China is going to just undo whatever good we can do. The November 9 deal between President's Xi and Obama has been widely criticized, but nevertheless represents a major milestone in getting the world's biggest economies on the record to do something about emissions. And an analysis by Brookings suggests that it's likely China's sincerity is being underestimated.\n\nThere are innumerable details for both parties to work out to reach their respective targets set forth in the deal, but it is important to understand a couple of things about China here. First, the air pollution there is already so severe they quite literally are killing themselves. It's almost implausible to believe they won't live up to the accord given it's a matter of life and death. Second, because of China's command economy, it can achieve successes at a greater rate than the market will in many cases. The latest forecasts call for a tripling of global solar power by decade's end. If China wanted that number to then double every 2 years for the next decade, it alone could make such a result happen.\n\n4) Renewables cheaper than coal, gas, and everything else\n\nFortunately, China likely won't be going it alone, however. Just last week, the New York Times reported utilities were signing contracts to buy power from renewables for less than the cost of electricity from fossil fuels. While some of those deals relied on government subsidies that are expiring and unlikely to be renewed, the most important news was this:\n\nAccording to a study by the investment banking firm Lazard ... natural gas comes at 6.1 cents a kilowatt-hour on the low end and coal at 6.6 cents. Without subsidies, the firm's analysis shows, solar costs about 7.2 cents a kilowatt-hour at the low end, with wind at 3.7 cents.\n\nIn other words, power from the sun is nearly as inexpensive as coal and gas. Power from the wind is less expensive. Of course, both are intermittent and we don't yet have any ability to store enough electricity to rely on them as primary sources. But the price gap would widen if a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system was in place, which is inevitable in some jurisdictions whether the U.S. adopts one or not. And solar promises to get cheaper still as panel efficiency improves, installation gets easier and manufacturing gets cheaper. By the middle of the next decade, solar and wind plus storage costs will compete well with fossil-fuel power across much of the planet, often coming out as the less expensive solution. The idea this would be true is no longer fantasy, it's near certainty.\n\n5) A lone wolf howls in agreement\n\nThe bright future for renewables allows David Crane, the maverick CEO of electric utility NRG, to announce his company will cut its carbon emissions 90% by 2050 and 50% by 2030. To put those numbers in perspective, the U.S. agreed to a 26-28% cut overall in its deal with China. The EPA's goal for CO2 from power plants is a 30% cut by 2030. Crane and NRG plan to blow past those numbers.\n\nCrane told the New York Times: \"The power industry is the biggest part of the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, but it has the potential to be an even bigger part of the solution.\" He's betting big on solar, big on natural gas (see above) as an interim solution, and doesn't want to give up on coal quite yet. To that end, NRG is testing a solution that will capture the CO2 from a coal plant, use it to help extract oil, and then bury it underground. The scheme might not work, but if you're truly committed like Crane, you go all in.\n\n6) The German experiment\n\nThat \"just do it\" approach has characterized the massive effort underway in Germany called the Energiewende, or energy transformation. The Germans want to nearly match NRG on a countrywide basis, getting 80% of their power from renewables by mid-century. While they've got a long way to go, 2014 has been a milestone year. As ThinkProgress reported, one day in May the country reached 74% output from renewables. In the first quarter of the year 27% of all electricity was generated from green power, a ratio twice that of the U.S.\n\nThe Germans are a punching bag for critics who claim this whole endeavor is costing the country too much. And with German insolation (the amount of sun that shines on the country over the year) comparable to Alaska, it might seem the critics are right. But high penetration of solar has led to the lowest installed costs anywhere in the developed world and as a result solar has achieved grid parity in Germany -- it produces power at a comparable cost to fossil fuels when everything is considered. While retail rates for electricity rose to pay for the renewables push, wholesale prices are already falling, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute told Think Progress.\n\nHe adds that consumer rates will soon be falling as the lower wholesale rates get baked into new long-term contracts. It's close enough to a free lunch that German investment in the Energiewende, rather than destroying the economy, will likely make it even more competitive. Bad news for German rivals, but a powerful lesson in myth busting.\n\n7) Speaking of (and to) the Germans\n\nTesla's Elon Musk let on to Der Spiegel (as reported by Reuters) that he had spoken to BMW about collaborating on battery and charging technology. Possible partnerships aren't especially exciting, unless they involve the company pushing electric-vehicle development the most aggressively working with a competitor to advance the technology farther faster. And that's what we see here. Musk in the past spoke of making Tesla's Supercharging network available to other automakers so long as they paid part of the cost of building and operating it. He also told Der Spiegel Tesla would almost certainly build a battery factory in Germany in 5-6 years. Perhaps the second Gigafactory?\n\nRon Baron, a mutual fund manager, appeared on CNBC to suggest these talks are just the beginning. He believes that with battery costs falling, EVs will reach cost parity with gas-powered cars soon enough. And because of that: \"We believe that BMW will likely phase out internal combustion engines over the next 10 years!\" That quote comes from a recent newsletter to investors and a Green Car Reports post. It's possible a decade is far too little time for BMW -- or any automaker -- to make the switch to electric. But it's also possible the transition is going to occur much more quickly than it appears right now, when only about 0.1% of the world's new cars are purely powered by batteries.\n\n8) If anyone is driving those cars, that is\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle involves something called a macrotrend, a large-scale change in the way people go about things. This one appears to be global and generational: People are less interested in owning cars and less interested in driving them. While we might have to wait a while to get a true \"robocar\" that can pick us up anywhere and whisk us to our destination without anyone at the wheel, people are already discovering the next best thing is already here.\n\nThe hints are in a KPMG study, reported in Autoblog, about the decline in two-car households in the U.S. Today, 57% of the 115 million households here have 2 or more vehicles. That's expected to decline to 43% over the next 25 years. If so, KPMG says, the number of cars in the country will actually decline. One of the great climate fears was that someday the Chinese would demand to be more like Americans, with a car for everyone, spewing CO2 and other pollutants. But what if, instead, the two cultures are merging along similar ideals of mobility: More urban and less auto-centric. Vehicle miles traveled has been falling across all age groups but plummeting in the younger demographics:\n\nThere's much more to this story about the decline of autos than can fit in the eighth piece of the puzzle, so I'll revisit it soon. But suffice it to say that we're seeing a worldwide, structural change that has the potential to increase mobility for the average person while decreasing the need to own or drive a car. (Hint: Uber and Lyft have a lot to do with it.)\n\nPut all these together and you have a fascinating picture of global moves toward carbon reduction, especially from unexpected places, and success stories that belie the claims of naysayers. While it wouldn't be accurate to claim there was a strong enough consensus to take immediate action, the possibilities of a sharp turn away from the old CO2 heavy global economy to a much less carbon intensive one seem well within our grasp. Where that leaves sea levels is ultimately a function of just how sharp that turn is, how much of an impact mankind has on the climate, and whether the fictional Mr. Westbrook was right about just how far gone things already are. Still, as Jeff Daniels' Will McAvoy says to him on Newsroom: \"Can you give us a reason to be optimistic?\" You now have eight.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

The ones that run on the conventional lead acid batteries, lithium ion batteries and the third one on super capacitors. Our car can clock 1000 kilometers in a single charge,\" said Shashi Vyas, who claimed to have developed the car at the company's facility at Aslali in Ahmedabad.\n\n\"The lead acid batteries that weigh about 300 kilograms (120 volt) can take about eight hours for a single recharge, the lithium ion weighing about 120 kgs takes about two hours and 20 kilogram supercapacitors can do the job in five minutes. These cars could cost anywhere between Rs15-25 lakh,\" said Vyas who described himself as an aerospace engineer.\n\nVyas's company has already entered into an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Madhya Pradesh government for setting up a plant to manufacture these electric sports car. \"We have been allocated 100 acres of land for this purpose. However, we are looking to set up a similar plant in Gujarat as well, because this is where we are based. We are looking to raise the funds for our project through venture capitalists,\" he told mediapersons at the event.\n\nMeanwhile, Rashmi Urdhwareshe, director of ARAI who was present at the event confirmed that her organisation is examining the prototype sent by Vyas. \"We are yet to give any clearance as we do not have any set rules for sports cars in our country and electric sports cars will require a totally different set of rules.\"\n\nThe three-day show however, had no new launches of new models or prototypes from any of the car or bike manufacturers who were among the 70-odd exhibitors at the event. \"We had requested them to display some prototypes at the event, but the companies declined saying that this time of the year was not suited for any new launches,\" said an official of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) who had organised the continued...", "A former racing driver has been fined \u00a32,000 and banned from driving for 15 months after admitting to speeding on the A96 in the Highlands.\n\nPolice clocked Owen Mildenhall, 41, of Edenbridge, Kent, travelling at 127mph in a Porsche Carrera 911 at Tornagrain near Inverness.\n\nThe incident happened at 00:45 on 10 July.\n\nMildenhall had since lost his job as a motoring journalist, Inverness Sheriff Court heard on Thursday.\n\nHe was in the Highlands to test drive a new BMW.\n\nMildenhall admitted driving dangerously on a single carriageway stretch of the A96 at more than twice the legal speed limit of 60mph.\n\nSheriff David Sutherland ordered him to pass an extended driving test on completion of the driving ban.", "BMW Motorrad's first concept store has launched in South Africa offering a \"premium lifestyle and retail experience for motorcycle customers and enthusiasts\".\n\nThe Donford Motorrad Cape Town store opening also represents a new brand positioning for the global manufacturer, who will be focussing more on the lifestyle aspects of its two wheelers, rather than the pure technical aspects.\n\nAccording to Stephan Schaller, Global President of BMW Motorrad, the group currently has 1000 motorcycle dealers worldwide. They would like to see this number increase to 1500 in the next five years.\n\n\"That is why this dealership is such a good role model because it is exactly what we want it to look like,\" Schaller said at the launch event on Wednesday.\n\nThe brainchild of Leon Potgieter and Mark Philp - owners of the Donford BMW franchise in Stellenbosch - the concept store was a R40 million investment.\n\nPotgieter explains that they pitched the idea of a satellite dealership to BMW in April last year. As a result, the pair went overseas to look at other dealerships.

The other new models are the R1200 R, the R1200 RS, the S 1000 RR and the F 800 R.\n\nEssentially, BMW wants to expand its market share and is also looking at smaller (sub-500 cc scooters and bikes).

However, for a true petrolhead, that pales in comparison with the awe-inspiring S65 AMG Coupe presented at the Paris Motor Show. Short of the G63 6x6 monster, this is the most expensive, most luxurious and ridiculously powerful Mercedes that everybody wants and nobody can afford. We love it!\n\nBut first, a little history lesson. In 1993 Mercedes presented the first S-Class with a V12 engine, the first 600, reacting to BMW's effort in the same segment and building on the success of the 600SEL. There was even a limited production S70 AMG model powered by the same engine they made for the Pagani Zonda. It took until 2004 for the S65 AMG to come out with a tuned engine and sports setup, quickly becoming the stuff of legend.\n\nAlmost exactly a decade later, we have not only a new chapter, but a new book to tell the continuation of that story.\n\nPresented earlier this year, this S 65 AMG model is a an imposing four-door coupe. Let's get some of the facts out of the way first: 6 liters of displacement from 12 cylinders; 630 PS delivered with the help of twin turbines; basically more torque than you actually need or could use - a nice, round 1000 Nm... limited to stop the tires from exploding. For our American friends, that translates into 737 lb-ft of tire-squealing twisting power. That's a lot more than the 650 lb-ft of torque claimed by the monstrous Dodge Charger Hellcat.\n\nIn between the engine and the wheels, Mercedes has stuck one of its seven-speed gearboxes which can force in the cogs fast enough for a 0 to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds, 0.2 seconds faster than the S65 AMG saloon, but slower than the 63 with all-wheel drive.\n\nBut this car ins't about going fast, it's about the ultimate prestige tool for people with fine taste, ambition and a lot of cash. It's not something you can buy from Jaguar, BMW or Audi. \"There are AMG fans for whom our V12 biturbo engine is the measure of all things,\" explains AMG chief Tobias Moers.\n\nWe've selected two walkaround videos of the new S65 AMG saloon from some of the most popular Youtube channels for this kind of stuff. The first one is by Saabkyle04 and already has over 120,000 views despite only being uploaded a week ago.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video", "Japan's transport minister Akihiro Ohta said Friday that the accidents and recalls linked to air bags made by Tokyo-based Takata could threaten the world's confidence in the country's auto industry. The faulty air bags have so far been linked to five deaths worldwide and the company faces a criminal investigation in the U.S.\n\nOhta also said that the government will order Takata's customers to issue a nationwide recall in Japan, if the U.S. extends its recall, Bloomberg reported. The country's transport ministry has also asked Takata to report on how it plans to tackle U.S. authorities' recent demand to extend its safety campaigns across the U.S. by Dec. 2. The company has so far limited the campaign to regions with high humidity, which reportedly triggers an explosive deployment of the air bags, accompanied by metal fragments.\n\n\"This is an extremely important issue for automobile safety,\" Ohta said, according to Reuters, adding: \"Japanese manufacturing enjoys a high level of trust so I am worried this situation will shake that confidence.\"\n\nOhta's statement follows Japan's decision, earlier this week, to form a special task force to handle the increasing number of recalls. On Thursday, Toyota expanded its recalls and also said that the company and its subsidiary, Daihatsu, would recall 85,000 vehicles outside the U.S. to repair air bags on the driver's side. Until now, recalls at the world's largest carmaker were limited to issues with passenger-side air bags.\n\n\"Although we haven't confirmed the minister's remarks, we deeply apologize for the troubles caused to all by our air-bag defects,\" Toyohiro Hishikawa, a spokesperson for Takata, told Bloomberg, adding: \"We will exert all efforts to regain the trust.\"\n\nNearly 14 million vehicles have been recalled globally, with Japan accounting for about 2.6 million recalls, mostly for faulty air bags on the passenger side.\n\n\"If there is a nationwide recall in the U.S., we've directed Takata to take the same measure in Japan,\" Ohta said, after a cabinet meeting, according to the New York Times, adding: \"There is a risk that trust in Japanese carmakers could weaken, so the problem must be resolved as quickly as possible.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Takata to expand its recalls for driver-side air bags to cover the entire country. The move is expected to trigger recalls by Ford Motors, Honda Motor Co, Chrysler Group LLC, Mazda Motor Corp and BMW AG. The regulator has reportedly given Takata time until Tuesday to order the recalls or be fined up to $7,000 for each vehicle.\n\n\"The biggest question mark is nobody knows exactly how many more have to be recalled, and as a result, nobody knows what's going to be the final damage,\" Koji Endo, an analyst at Advanced Research Japan, said, according to Bloomberg, adding: \"Almost every week, we have an additional 100,000 or 50,000 recalls around the world.\"", "The accident happened on the A19 north Tees Flyover near Portrack and involved a black BMW and a Vauxhall Agila\n\nTwo drivers had a lucky escape when both their cars caught on fire after a rush-hour smash.\n\nThe accident happened at 5.20pm today on the outside lane of the A19 north Tees Flyover near Portrack.\n\nIt involved a black BMW and a Vauxhall Agila.\n\nBoth the northbound and the southbound carriageways were closed. The southbound reopened at 6.25pm.\n\nAn ambulance attended the scene but there were no injuries.\n\nThe Highways Agency also attended and the northbound carriageway remained closed until the cars were recovered and the road had been cleansed.\n\nThe crash caused delays to drivers at rush hour with stationary traffic backed up to the A174 Parkway turn-off and the A689 Wolviston/Wynyard turn-off. A police spokesman said they had a \"very lucky\" escape.", "Toyota Motor Corporation has said it would recall 57,000 vehicles globally to replace potentially deadly air bags.\n\nThe air bags, according to the auto maker, are made by Takata Corporation.\n\nAccording to the report, Toyota's action followed a recall by rival Honda Motor Company for the same problem two weeks ago after revelations of a fifth death, in Malaysia, linked to Takata's air bag inflator, noting that more than 16 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata's air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal fragments into the car.\n\nToyota said it is recalling some Vitz subcompacts, called Yaris in some markets, and RAV4 crossover models made between December 2002 and March 2004, explaining that about 40,000 are in Japan, 6,000 in Europe and the rest in other markets outside North America. Toyota said it was not aware of any injury or death related to the recall.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has given Takata until Tuesday to issue a nationwide recall, and could fine it up to $7,000 per vehicle if it doesn't comply. The report noted that it remains unclear how many more vehicles that would add to the recall list, saying that it could be in the millions, affecting five automakers: Ford Motor Company, Honda, Chrysler Group LLC, Mazda Motor Corporation and BMW AG.\n\nA transport ministry official in Japan said about 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan so far for Takata's air bag inflators.\n\nThe report noted that Takata-related recalls are almost certain to balloon after U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday ordered the company to expand a regional recall of driver-side air bags to cover the entire United States, not just hot and humid areas where the air bag inflators are thought to become more volatile, but added that Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.", "Rolls Royce CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos .\u200a.\u200a. It takes 800 man hours to build a Rolls Royce, all by hand, bar two robots in our paintshop, so we're an investment, a reward for achievement - never just bling.\n\nIn September, Macau hotelier Stephen Hung placed a record order for 30 Rolls Royce Phantoms. Under the British car maker's unique way of doing business, it had a few calls to make before sending out the press release.\n\nHung's order, which includes the two most expensive bespoke Phantoms ever made, will make his fleet the largest in the world when they are delivered to his Louis XIII hotel in 2016. In the rarefied super-luxury world that Rolls Royce Motor Cars inhabits, there were the feelings of previous claimants to those titles to consider.\n\nUS casino mogul Steve Wynn, Hong Kong billionaire Michael Kadoorie and Jumeirah, the owners of Dubai's Burj Al Arab, were among those contacted before the deal with Stephen Hung was made public.\n\n\"Not in a way that was like 'Hey Steve, top this!',\" insists Richard Carter, Rolls Royce Motor Cars global head of communications.\n\n\"It was simply to tell them that this is what was going on in the Rolls Royce world, a world of which they are a part. It's the kind of thing you just wouldn't want them learning about in the media.\"\n\nSurreptitious sales tactic or not, the ring-around is symbolic of a more open, less formal way of doing business at Rolls Royce Motor Cars since its chief executive, Torsten Muller-Otvos, took over in 2010.\n\n\"We started doing social media, and different sorts of marketing events which took out some of the formality,\" Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"Then last year we launched the Wraith, a coupe and far more approachable for a younger buyer, a successful entrepreneur who wants to drive themselves. The Wraith has taken our new customers' average age down by 10 years.\"\n\nRolls Royce Motor Cars is selling four times more vehicles than it was when Muller-Otvos, a veteran of parent BMW, took the reins. It will exceed 4000 sales globally for the first time in 2014. However, its Goodwood plant can't produce many more, and can't expand due to its heritage-protected West Sussex location.\n\nThis is fine by Muller-Otvos.\n\n\"Our rarity is part of the promise to our customers,\" he says. \"Even Bentley now are talking volume, volume, volume, looking at 15,000 cars a year. A customer said to me the other day, that is just 'mass luxury'.\"\n\nEven so, the basic Wraith's $645,000 on-road price tag has made Rolls Royce attainable for the newly wealthy, even as rappers' 'bling' (and occasional drive-by target).\n\n\"We've always been on board with flamboyant people. Just look at John Lennon's Phantom V,\" Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"The fact is, it takes 800 man hours to build a Rolls Royce, all by hand, bar two robots in our paintshop, so we're an investment, a reward for achievement - never just bling.\"\n\nA key to running Rolls Royce is to never react to what competitors are doing, Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"Frederick Royce said, 'take the best and make it better'. But never copy. If we followed our competitors we'd have an SUV out by now. But a super-luxury brand must be sovereign.\"\n\nRolls Royce Motor Cars does react to what its customers are saying, especially given there are few enough of them for Muller-Otvos to know many on a first-name basis.\n\n\"For instance, for our new Phantom Series II our owners told us they were happy with the previous Phantom model, they just suggested tweaks. So that car ended up more of an evolution than a revolution.\"\n\nRolls Royce owners have also helped ensure the car maker still builds 12-cylinder engines on the cusp of the green car age, flatly rejecting its electric experiment, the 102EX.\n\nHowever, Muller-Otvos knows it won't be long before \"whole city blocks are out of limits if you're not driving an electric car\", so the company is looking at a possible hybrid plug-in solution.", "Continental has announced they've updated their MIB brake system to include cornering ABS.\n\nBosch was first to the market with cornering ABS last year, but at the 2014 EICMA show it became clear that manufacturers see it as a necessary feature, even if it's only an option.\n\nSeveral new machines were introduced with cornering ABS. Now Continental has a competing offering to Bosch's system, which could be very good news. Competition should bring the price of these systems down, and the quality up.\n\nAccording to Continental's press release, the cornering ABS uses an on-board sensor to check the bike's roll and pitch rates, as well as lateral acceleration and lean angle. It performs these checks approximately 100 times per second.\n\nAs the rider corners, the ABS system limits the braking power accordingly. The Continental system also ties into other bike systems and allows detection of rear wheel lift under heavy braking (\"anti-stoppie technology\"), traction control and can even prevent the front wheel from lifting (\"anti-wheelie technology\").\n\nThe first motorcycle we know to use the Continental system will be BMW's S1000 XR, but we're sure others will follow.", "Mercedes-Benz has announced the AMG Sport family of high-performance models.

(TSX VENTURE: CVN) (\"Cavan\" or the \"Company\") has entered preliminary discussions with a private arm's length vendor regarding 150 hectares of agricultural land in the Philippines. The agricultural land is located approximately 3.5 hours from Manila, the Philippines' largest port and capital city.\n\nThe Company intends to begin its due diligence analysis of the agricultural land immediately, particularly as to its suitability for the construction of a hemp cultivation and manufacturing plant for hemp and cannabinoid products. As previously announced (see the Company's news release on March 25, 2014, and the clarifying news release on November 24, 2014), the Company intends to diversify its operations into the hemp and cannabinoid industry.\n\nThe Company and the private vendor have entered into a non-disclosure and standstill agreement with respect to these discussions. At this time, no further deal terms have been reached, nor has the Company entered into any letters of intent or definitive agreements with respect to the agricultural lands. As the Company's discussions remain at a preliminary stage only, there can be no assurance or guarantee that the Company will enter into a binding agreement with respect to the acquisition of such agricultural lands. The Company will provide further updates as they are available.\n\nAs such, the Company further cautions investors that: (i) the Company does not presently have regulatory approvals to become a producer of hemp or cannabinoid products in the Philippines; and (ii) any transaction resulting in the Company's entry into the hemp/cannabinoid industry, or a \"spin out\" plan of arrangement of the Company's assets, will require various approvals, including that of the Company's board of directors, shareholders the TSX Venture Exchange, and, with respect to a plan of arrangement, court approval, and none of these approvals have been sought at present.\n\nThe Hemp Industry in the Philippines\n\nThe Philippines have optimal growing conditions for industrial hemp, which would allow for up to three hemp crop cycles a year, as opposed to only one or two cycles within Canada and other similar environments. Additionally, the proximity of the Philippines to Asian markets is attractive to the Company and its growth plans. Though the Company will conduct further analysis, there does not appear at present to be restrictions on processing hemp in the Philippines, nor clear regulation standards or restrictions on industrial hemp farming in the Philippines. If the Company proceeds with a hemp project in the Philippines, it will be required to comply with all local regulations, and there can be no assurance or guarantee that the Company will be able to do so.\n\nThe Global Hemp Market\n\nHemp is one of the earliest domesticated plants known. It has been cultivated by many civilizations for over 12,000 years and currently over 30 countries are producing industrial hemp. Global hemp production increased from 250 million pounds in 1999 to more than 380 million pounds in 2011. In 2013 alone the U.S. retail hemp market was valued at 581 million with sales in US conventional retailers growing by 26.5%. There are currently over 50,000 different applications that hemp is used for on the market today including Industrial textiles, consumer textiles, paper, building materials, foods, industrial products and personal hygiene to name a few. Even various car manufacturers are integrating hemp into their vehicles including Audi, BMW, FORD, GM, Chrysler, Honda, Mercedes, Mitsubishi and Porsche and Volkswagen. For example, Mercedes C-Class contains up to 20kg in each car. With increased social acceptance of industrial hemp these numbers will only continue to grow.\n\nCertain statements in this release are forward-looking statements, which reflect the expectations of management regarding the Company's discussions regarding a potential acquisition of agricultural lands in the Philippines, the Company's plans to operate in the hemp/cannabinoid sphere, the hemp industry in the Philippines, and the global hemp industry generally.

However, over the past 13 years the range has slowly swollen and there are currently eight distinctly different MINIs available, plus limited edition models.\n\nBut rather than diluting the brand, the expansion has worked -- MINI is enjoying record sales -- and has led to some imitation, most notably from Fiat with its equally retro-styled 500 being stretched into a range including a five-door model, a people-carrier and most recently, a small crossover.\n\nAlthough Schwarzenbauer wouldn't be drawn on specifics, the cars most likely to get the chop will be the Paceman, the Coup\u00e9 and the Roadster.\n\nSlimming down the range will also give MINI the space to add new levels of customer care and individual service. Bringing a premium touch to the mass market car-buying experience is a growing trend.\n\nCitro\u00ebn has recently spun out its DS range as a separate premium brand with a focus on client relationship and Ford is about to launch its Vignale sub-brand in Europe.

Under the British car maker's unique way of doing business, it had a few calls to make before sending out the press release.\n\nHung's order, which includes the two most expensive bespoke Phantoms ever made, will make his fleet the largest in the world when they are delivered to his Louis XIII hotel in 2016. In the rarefied super-luxury world that Rolls Royce Motor Cars inhabits, there were the feelings of previous claimants to those titles to consider.\n\nUS casino mogul Steve Wynn, Hong Kong billionaire Michael Kadoorie and Jumeirah, the owners of Dubai's Burj Al Arab, were among those contacted before the deal with Stephen Hung was made public.\n\n\"Not in a way that was like 'Hey Steve, top this!',\" insists Richard Carter, Rolls Royce Motor Cars global head of communications.\n\n\"It was simply to tell them that this is what was going on in the Rolls Royce world, a world of which they are a part. It's the kind of thing you just wouldn't want them learning about in the media.\"\n\nSurreptitious sales tactic or not, the ring-around is symbolic of a more open, less formal way of doing business at Rolls Royce Motor Cars since its chief executive, Torsten Muller-Otvos, took over in 2010.\n\n\"We started doing social media, and different sorts of marketing events which took out some of the formality,\" Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"Then last year we launched the Wraith, a coupe and far more approachable for a younger buyer, a successful entrepreneur who wants to drive themselves. The Wraith has taken our new customers' average age down by 10 years.\"\n\nRolls Royce Motor Cars is selling four times more vehicles than it was when Muller-Otvos, a veteran of parent BMW, took the reins. It will exceed 4000 sales globally for the first time in 2014. However, its Goodwood plant can't produce many more, and can't expand due to its heritage-protected West Sussex location.\n\nThis is fine by Muller-Otvos.\n\n\"Our rarity is part of the promise to our customers,\" he says. \"Even Bentley now are talking volume, volume, volume, looking at 15,000 cars a year. A customer said to me the other day, that is just 'mass luxury'.\"\n\nEven so, the basic Wraith's $645,000 on-road price tag has made Rolls Royce attainable for the newly wealthy, even as rappers' 'bling' (and occasional drive-by target).\n\n\"We've always been on board with flamboyant people. Just look at John Lennon's Phantom V,\" Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"The fact is, it takes 800 man hours to build a Rolls Royce, all by hand, bar two robots in our paintshop, so we're an investment, a reward for achievement - never just bling.\"\n\nA key to running Rolls Royce is to never react to what competitors are doing, Muller-Otvos says.\n\n\"Frederick Royce said, 'take the best and make it better'. But never copy. If we followed our competitors we'd have an SUV out by now. But a super-luxury brand must be sovereign.\"\n\nRolls Royce Motor Cars does react to what its customers are saying, especially given there are few enough of them for Muller-Otvos to know many on a first-name basis.\n\n\"For instance, for our new Phantom Series II our owners told us they were happy with the previous Phantom model, they just suggested tweaks. So that car ended up more of an evolution than a revolution.\"\n\nRolls Royce owners have also helped ensure the car maker still builds 12-cylinder engines on the cusp of the green car age, flatly rejecting its electric experiment, the 102EX.\n\nHowever, Muller-Otvos knows it won't be long before \"whole city blocks are out of limits if you're not driving an electric car\", so the company is looking at a possible hybrid plug-in solution.", "Are you covered?

She has family members in the St. Louis area and said they've experienced much of the racism and tension from police that protesters are fighting to address following the grand jury's refusal to indict the Ferguson police officer who killed Michael Brown.\n\n\"Talking to my family, they felt so alone, like no one cared,\" she said. \"This is just one protest nationwide. I think this is an incredible show of support, (something) I've never seen in my life.\"\n\nTwo hours later, however, the protest turned violent as some in the crowd threw rocks, breaking windows at an Arco gas station and at the Weatherford BMW repair shop on West Grand. Others tagged a several buildings.\n\nOne protester jumped on a car, smashing the windshield.\n\nPolice, trailing in force behind the crowd, made a quick arrest of a protester who jumped on a car smashing the windshield.\n\nMarchers then lit a fire in a big rolling dumpster and pushed it down San Pablo before abandoning it as police charged from the rear of the march.\n\nThe protest then veered back through downtown, where more windows were smashed, including those at the Oakland Tribune on Broadway.\n\nA few protesters seemed bent on causing damage.\n\n\"I had a rock,\" said one person in the crowd to another marcher. \"I just couldn't find a window to throw it through.\"\n\nOther marchers condemned the actions, yelling, \"This is our city. Do you even live here?\"\n\nPolice continued to pursue the crowd, at times urging the crowd to keep moving and the surging from behind, sending protesters scurrying.\n\nJust before 10 p.m., police declared an unlawful assembly at 14th Street and Broadway and advanced on the crowd making a handful of arrests. The crowd dispersed shortly after that.\n\nYusupha Harding, 33, of Hayward, stood at 14th and Broadway after police stormed the intersection and made multiple arrests. He said he prefers a peaceful demonstration, but feels like this week's actions are important.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense for the police to shoot if you're unarmed or don't have any weapons,\" he said. \"I think we need this for a couple of nights, to show our frustration. It might make them think twice next time.\"", "TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would recall 57,000 vehicles globally to replace potentially deadly air bags made by Takata Corp, as a safety crisis around the Japanese auto parts maker looks far from being contained.\n\nToyota's action follows a recall by rival Honda Motor Co for the same problem two weeks ago after revelations of a fifth death, in Malaysia, linked to Takata's air bag inflator. More than 16 million vehicles have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata's air bag inflators, which can explode with too much force and spray metal fragments into the car.\n\nToyota is recalling some Vitz subcompacts, called Yaris in some markets, and RAV4 crossover models made between December 2002 and March 2004. About 40,000 are in Japan, 6,000 in Europe and the rest in other markets outside North America. Toyota said it was not aware of any injury or death related to the recall.\n\nSeparately, Toyota's small-car subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co also issued a recall, in Japan, of 27,571 Mira minivehicles produced between December 2002 and May 2003 for the same reason - its first recall involving Takata inflators.\n\nAbout 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan so far for Takata's air bag inflators, a transport ministry official said.\n\nTakata-related recalls are almost certain to balloon after U.S. safety regulators on Wednesday ordered the company to expand a regional recall of driver-side air bags to cover the entire United States, not just hot and humid areas where the air bag inflators are thought to become more volatile.\n\nTakata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.\n\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has given Takata until Tuesday to issue a nationwide recall, and could fine it up to $7,000 per vehicle if it doesn't comply. It remains unclear how many more vehicles that would add, but it could be in the millions, affecting five automakers: Ford Motor Co, Honda, Chrysler Group LLC, Mazda Motor Corp and BMW AG.\n\nA U.S.-wide recall of driver-side air bags could cost an estimated 70 billion yen ($600 million), Nomura Credit Research analyst Shintaro Niimura wrote in a Nov. 26 report.\n\n\"Takata could need nearly 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion) of reserves in the event of a U.S. nationwide recall (including passenger-side air bags), and the company's cash-on-hand would be tightly squeezed,\" he wrote, noting Takata had just 8.33 billion yen of cash and deposits.\n\n\"If the company makes any missteps, we cannot say that there is 'zero' chance of the company dying a sudden death - that is, being hit with excessive debt or facing a cash-insolvency bankruptcy,\" Niimura added.\n\nNHTSA's action and the latest recalls come on the heels of an announcement by Japan's transport ministry on Wednesday that it received a report of an \"unusual deployment\" of a Takata air bag as it was being removed from a scrapped car on Nov. 6. The inflator was manufactured in January 2003 at Takata's Monclova, Mexico factory, and had not been subject to recalls, at least in Japan, raising the prospect of an expanded recall, the ministry said.\n\nA Toyota spokesman said the scrapped car was a 2003 Will Cypha, a Japan-only compact model that is no longer in production. Toyota said it was investigating the issue as part of its wider probe into Takata's air bag inflators. \"We will take prompt and appropriate action if we find there is a need for a recall as a result of the investigation,\" it said.\n\nTakata shares dropped as much as 7.9 percent in Tokyo on Thursday, closing down 4.8 percent. Toyota shares eased 0.5 percent and Daihatsu shares slipped 1.2 percent, roughly in line with the broader market. Shares of Honda, Takata's top customer, underperformed other auto stocks, falling 3.3 percent.\n\nHonda had said the Takata air bag inflator that failed in the Malaysia crash had likely been exposed to excessive moisture at the supplier's now-shuttered plant in LaGrange, Georgia. A transport ministry official said no further recalls are expected in Japan related to the problem identified at the LaGrange line between November 2001 and November 2003.\n\nA second U.S. congressional hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, where representatives from Takata, NHTSA and several automakers will testify.", "BMW's next-generation 7 Series flagship has been spied in a state of undress this week, revealing its sleek new profile.\n\nAs expected, the new 7 Series will follow the 3 Series and 5 Series into wearing a more coupe-like profile (although not to the extent of the 4 Series Gran Coupe), giving the big limo the lines needed to take on Merc's new S-Class.\n\nIt is also clear from these new photos that the face of the new 7 Series will feature the same 'end-to-end' connected design of BMW's latest sedan and X SUV offerings, with the headlights extending directly to the familiar kidney grille.\n\nThough appearing to closely emulate the current model's proportions, the next 7 Series is expected to ride on all-new underpinnings that should eventually feature with a number of other BMW models.\n\nSignificant weight reduction is expected over the current entry 730d's 1840kg, with greater use of aluminium and carbon fibre thanks to technologies drawn from the advanced BMW i models.\n\nAlso expected is the debut of several new BMW EfficientDynamics systems, including a thermoelectric turbosteamer and generator to make better use of waste heat energy, and reduce overall fuel consumption.\n\nReports also suggest the new model will introduce a plug-in hybrid variant among its range of petrol and diesel engines, possibly using technology borne from BMW's technology alliance with Toyota.\n\nThe next-generation 7 Series is likely to wear the model designation G11, and is expected to go on sale in Europe in the latter half of 2015 as a 2016 model.", "The 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show has now been and gone, with the international motor-show circus spotlight now moving to January's Detroit Auto Show.\n\nBut, as always, the increasingly important LA show brought a number of key debuts, from the new Mazda CX-3, sure to be a top-seller in the light SUV market, to the Audi Prologue, widely believed to be our first look at a new 'A9' flagship coupe.\n\nThose two and many more caught the attention of media and showgoers in LA this month.

No surprise that Ford's not saying, but boy can we hope.\n\nIt's a mighty fine evolution, though, and new Audi design boss Marc Lichte is the man we can thank for it.\n\nExpect this look to appear on more Audi models in the future, and possibly also on a new A9 coupe that would take the fight right up to Merc's S-Class Coupe.\n\nLast but not least is the last model to the new-generation battle for midsized luxury performance supremacy: Cadillac's ATS-V sedan and coupe.\n\nWith more of the same sharp lines that dominate the Cadillac range, the ATS-V has sprouted a big bonnet bulge and neatly pumped guards for a mean new look.\n\nMore than that, it's also packing a 340kW twin-turbo 3.0 litre V6 that should help it steal a few sales (in the US at least; we won't see it here) from BMW's 317kW M3 and M4 models.\n\nWhat floated your boat?

In October, Automobile magazine reported that BMW's i brand is working on an i8S that would be stiffer and more powerful, and celebrate the marque's centenary in 2016. At the time, one of two power unit combinations was suggested, either one of them good for more than 500 horsepower.\n\nCar magazine has added more info on the coupe said to be called Project M100, saying that in addition to being a birthday gift for BMW, it will also be a going-away statement to current chairman Norbert Reithofer, who is expected to retire in 2016 or 2017. It will also be so thoroughly reworked that there will be plenty of daylight between it and the standard i8: a more integrated carbon fiber and aluminum chassis, a wider range of materials used in the build, a larger luggage bay due to the omission of rear seats, a more aggressive suspension supporting heartier brakes and wider tires, and - perhaps - a different aero and ground-effects package to be visually different and make the most of the alterations.\n\nAs for that power unit, Car says that the two options mentioned by Automobile are still under consideration, being either a 2.0-liter twin-turbo four-cylinder with 320 horsepower and a 204-hp electric motor, or a 3.0-liter straight six with 480 hp and a 109 hp. Either choice gets an integrated starter motor good for another 27 hp, and a total torque number of roughly 520 pound-feet, 100 additional lb-ft than the current car.

Together with Broom by Starck, the popular chair introduced in 2012, Broom Stools, which come in two heights - Counter Stool and Barstool - will form the Broom Collection. The Broom Chair and Stools are one-piece (mono-block) designs, which ensure strength and uniformity.\n\nEmeco's exploration of innovative ways to up-cycle waste and use reclaimed resources in their products led to an entirely new material in 2012 when they created the Broom Chair. Broom Chair and Broom Stools are made with that material consisting of 75-per-cent waste polypropylene and 15-per-cent waste wood fibre. The Broom Stools are available in the same colours as Broom Chair: green, orange, white, yellow, dark grey and natural.\n\nSays Magnus Breitling, V-P of Product, Emeco, \"As we worked with Starck to design the Broom Barstool we kept in mind the limited space at a bar in a restaurant or hotel. We reduced the seat width while maintaining the comfort. Like its ancestor the Broom Chair, the Broom Barstool is more than just a 'mono-block' stool.

The system is similar to that used by the BMW X5 eDrive concept, which first appeared at last year's Frankfurt motor show.\n\nBMW claims the 3 Series plug-in hybrid has a pure electric range of approximately 35km, and can operate without any assistance from the petrol engine at speeds up to 120km/h.\n\nThe car maker says there's only a small reduction in the plug-in hybrid's boot space compared with the regular sedan, as the sixth-generation model was originally developed to accommodate extra electric hardware.\n\nAs with regular BMW production models, the 3 Series plug-in hybrid prototype features a Drive Experience Control switch with selectable Comfort, Sport, and Eco Pro modes, while it also gets a plug-in-specific toggle for switching between all-electric Max eDrive mode and Save mode, which keeps the battery at a constant state of charge, reserving it for use in urban sections of the drive.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series plug-in hybrid is set to go on sale in Europe in the second half of 2015. It will effectively replace the non-rechargeable ActiveHybrid 3 in the car maker's mid-sized range.\n\nBMW Australia corporate communications general manager Lenore Fletcher suggested a local launch would still be \"a fair way out\" if the new model is confirmed for our market, but insisted the local division was \"very interested in lower-emission technology\" and would look at it seriously to add to the line-up.\n\nFletcher admitted the ActiveHybrid 3 has sold in very low numbers, but said the recent launch of the BMW i brand proved the company was committed to launching fuel efficient cars in our market."]}, "Telefonica": {"2014-11-28": ["The internal deliberations at the world's second-biggest mobile operator, have picked up pace in recent days after broadband leader BT Group (BT.L) revealed it was in parallel talks to buy either EE or Telefonica's 02 (TEF.MC).\n\nIf concluded, BT's foray into mobile is expected to tilt the market toward selling more all-included bundles of fixed and mobile services.

Of that total, 5.6 million are 4G customers, giving it a comfortable lead in the market. O2 ranks a close second with 24.1 million overall mobile customers.\n\nAccording to Reuters' sources, O2 parent Telefonica is understood to prefer a deal with BT, since the latter does not currently compete in the consumer mobile market and therefore a merger would throw up fewer antitrust issues.\n\nHowever, the same people said Telefonica could be persuaded to sell O2 to Hutchison if BT ends up acquiring EE.\n\nTelefonica and Hutch have done business before, merging their respective operations in Ireland. It is worth noting that EU approval of that deal came with strict conditions designed to safeguard competition.\n\nThe speculation emerged after BT this week revealed it is holding preliminary acquisition talks with O2 and one other operator.\n\nOn Wednesday, EE's parent companies Orange and Deutsche Telekom admitted that they are having \"exploratory discussions\" over selling EE to BT.\n\nShould its bid to acquire EE or O2 prove successful, BT will return to the consumer mobile market after an absence of 13 years.\n\nThe U.K. incumbent spun off its BT Cellnet mobile arm as mmO2 in 2001. The unit was later rebranded as O2 and became part of Telefonica in late 2005.", "Update 11/26: It has now emerged that Deutsche Telekom and Orange, joint shareholders of EE, have been in preliminary exploratory discussions with BT regarding EE. According to a press release on Orange's website, it is too early to state whether any transaction may occur.\n\nIt looks like BT might not just be eyeing up O2 as a potential purchase.\n\nOriginal story follows...\n\nBT is in talks to purchase the O2 mobile network from its Spanish parent company Telefonica in a deal valued at around \u00a310bn.\n\nThe company confirmed reports that appeared in Spanish media stating that Telefonica would take a 20 per cent stake in BT in exchange for O2.\n\n\"We have received expressions of interest from shareholders in two UK mobile network operators, of which one is O2, about a possible transaction in which BT would acquire their UK mobile business,\" BT said in a statement.\n\nHighly preliminary stage\n\n\"All discussions are at a highly preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that any transaction will occur.\"\n\nThe O2 network was original BT Cellnet before being spun off in 2001 and then sold to Telefonica in 2005. As a result of the announcement, BT's share price rose by four per cent.\n\nThe second mobile network BT claims to have been approached by is believed to be EE, although this hasn't been confirmed by either party.", "A rooftop loaded up with multiple wireless antennas (Source: Flickr / FlySi)\n\nThe one-time U.K. monopoly carrier BT may be sniffing around O2 and EE as it considers how best to get back into the mobile carrier game, but it seems it's not the only one. According to a Reuters report, Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa is also considering a bid for one of those companies. Hutch already owns Three, the smallest U.K. mobile network operator, so this would reduce the number of network-owning cellular players in the country down to three (the other being Vodafone). Three and EE already have a network-sharing deal that involves a joint venture called MBNL, so integration would be easier on that front. EE is jointly owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom and France's Orange, and O2 by Spain's Telefonica.", "The wireless market in the UK has several potential changes coming in early 2015, after both BT and Three showed interest in two of the largest wireless providers in the country: EE and O2.\n\nBT - the largest broadband provider in the country - is interested in offering a four bundle package, including broadband, wireless, TV and phone. The only part currently missing is the wireless carrier.\n\nEssentially BT has the choice of the two largest providers, capable of raising the capital needed to acquire one or the other. EE is the more expensive, with a valuation of \u00a311 billion ($17 billion) to O2's \u00a39.4 billion ($14.5 billion) valuation.\n\nAcquiring EE would give BT a hefty lead in the wireless market. The wireless provider currently controls 33.8 percent of all mobile subscribers and has established itself as the upcoming brand for new mobile owners.\n\nThe downside is the price increase and the potential conflict of interest, between EE's two owners, T-Mobile and Orange. The German and French companies do not always see eye-to-eye on changes and it will take more negotiations and money for BT.\n\nO2, on the other hand, has a 26.2 percent share of the mobile subscribers - the same as Vodafone. O2 is owned by Telef\u00f3nica, who bought the wireless carrier, ironically, from BT in 2005 for \u00a318 billion.\n\nThe reacquisition might not work for BT, especially since the valuation price for O2 is half what Telef\u00f3nica paid in 2005. O2 has a strong business customer base, but lacks the new 4G spectrum advantages EE managed to gain.\n\nBoth acquisitions would be good moves, according to analysts. Some see EE as a more profitable venture in the long term, with fiber optic broadband and 4G cellular, but others believe the lower price and business focus of O2 will be more helpful.\n\nBT has to keep some cash for the Premier League soccer rights coming in the next few months. Virgin Media, BT and Sky typically all fight for the prime-time live soccer games.\n\nThree is also an issue for BT, the fourth place wireless carrier. Three is owned by Hutchison Whampoa and has billions to potentially invest in O2 or EE. Three appears to be siding with an O2 acquisition, although some analysts say this is off the cards.\n\nThe four services: phone, wireless, mobile and TV, are almost certainly going to be the most sought after services. If BT can provide a wireless and broadband connection on the same bill, it could be huge for consumer loyalty.\n\nVirgin Media and Sky both lack the wireless carrier, but rumors say both are interested in potential acquisitions. 2015 may be the year where broadband acquires the wireless companies, similar to state of the U.S. wireless market.", "Speculation about the future structure of the UK telecoms market reached fever pitch this week as some industry watchers placed their bets on whether BT would buy EE or O2 UK, while others suggested Hutchison Whampoa could enter the race for one of the two mobile operators.\n\nCiting unnamed sources close to the matter, Reuters said the Hong Kong-based group, which already owns Three UK, could put forward a bid for EE or O2 UK by the end of the year.\n\nIt was also suggested that if BT opted to buy EE, then Telef\u00f3nica might be persuaded to sell its O2 UK unit to Hutchison in order to reduce debt, even though the merger of the two mobile operators would likely face a lengthier competition review than a merger of O2 UK with fixed-line provider BT.\n\nHutchison has a track record of snapping up other mobile operators in Europe, having already acquired Orange Austria and O2 Ireland to boost its existing operations in those markets. The Three Group has also not typically pursued the fixed-mobile convergence path, instead focusing on providing large mobile data bundles to its subscribers.\n\nMeanwhile separate reports on Friday also claimed that Telef\u00f3nica is seeking a \"global alliance\" with BT: Reuters said the Spanish company's chairman Cesar Alierta made comments to this effect on Monday.\n\nIn an emailed statement to FierceWireless:Europe, Telef\u00f3nica made no reference to such comments; an O2 UK spokesman merely reiterated that although conversations with BT are taking place, \"those are at a highly preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that any transaction may occur with such company\".\n\nEE parent companies Orange and Deutsche Telekom also confirmed this week that they are in early discussions with BT on a possible sale of their jointly owned UK business.\n\nSources told Reuters that a purchase of EE by BT would make sense because of the high quality of the asset and the fact that EE already provides mobile network access to BT under a wholesale arrangement. However, Reuters noted that analysts value O2 UK at about \u00a39.4 billion (\u20ac11.8 billion/$14.7 billion), which would make it a more digestible option than EE, valued at \u00a311 billion.\n\nFor more:\n\n- see this Reuters article\n\n- see this separate Reuters article", "The other day we reported on the rumor that's going around concerning BT's desire to either purchase or affiliate themselves with an existing UK mobile network with the objective of establishing a network of their very own.\n\nThose rumors have created quite the buzz in both the tech community and the stock market. Following the emergence of the rumor, and the confirmation of the talks by both BT and Telefonica in Spain, shares in BT have risen by around 1.6 percent to 400.2p per share.\n\nThe bidding war is brewing, however - a struggle between BT and Three may ensue for control over O2, as Three's Hutchison Whampoa has reportedly been considering putting in a bid for O2 before the end of the year.\n\nBoth Three and BT are also interested in potentially acquiring EE as well - potentially both EE and O2 could get scooped up by one company or the other, but for the moment the main focus seems to be on O2.\n\nSEE ALSO: Currys Black Friday Deals - Get Your Voucher Codes!\n\nEE is currently the biggest mobile network in the UK, and will most likely command a higher price, whereas the combination of either Three's or BT's existing assets with a less successful network such as O2 could work out better, and cheaper, in the long run.\n\nIt's a tangled web of bidding and buying at the moment, especially since Whampoa and Three have entered the game - BT's sights are fully set on developing their own flagship mobile network, which would mean BT are able to offer a complete package for mobile, landline, internet and TV to UK residents.\n\nIn the event that BT does take on board O2, the second biggest mobile network behind EE, the combination of the two would be substantial enough to challenge EE's dominance in the UK. Obviously it would be easier to just buy EE to achieve that top spot, but for BT the challenge of going their own way and making to the top spot without paying as much does seem like a better option.\n\nSEE ALSO: Black Friday: Vodafone Offers Up To 50% off Samsung, LG and Apple\n\nIn the climate of purchases and shuffling that saw high street retailer Phones4U go under earlier in the year due to canceled deals, it really does seem like that the UK mobile network game will see a lot of changes by 2015.\n\nAs it's going right now, the next year will probably be a massively exciting one in terms of tech. We're seeing almost every big announcement or product being billed for next year, very few have been announced at any point during 2016, so it's safe to say that things will be very interesting. Watch this space.", "Earlier this week we heard that British Telecom were in preliminary talks with both EE and O2 regarding a possible takeover.\n\nNow today Reuters have revealed that Three boss, Hutchison Whampoa is also ready to make a move for one of the two UK network giants.\n\nTheir report claims that while no comment has been made by Three or their boss, the China-owned company could put in a bid for either company by the end of this year.\n\nIf Three is really ready to go toe-to-toe with BT for EE in particular then they could have a slight advantage over their rivals given the fact they are not as large.\n\nEarlier this week we reported that EverythingEverywhere, owned by Orange and Deutsche Telekom, were the second operator BT were in talks with.\n\nWe also said how a takeover between those two would not be easy, BT would become the instant market leader if they took hold of EE and such a position of dominance is unlikely to sit well with communications regulator Ofcom and the European Commission.\n\nOne of Reuters' sources said that despite Three's advantageous position, they are known as extremely tough negotiators, which could make a agreeing a deal with Orange and Deutsche Telekom a touch more difficult.\n\nIt's also fair to say that BT have a significant advantage should they opt to takeover O2 instead. Up until 10 years ago O2 was owned by BT before being bought by Telefonica for \u00a318 billion; it is thought that buying back O2 would be a more straight forward process for British Telecom.\n\nWhat is clear is that for both BT and Three is that O2 would be cheaper as they are only valued at \u00a39.4 billion; EE on the other hand would cost a little more at around \u00a311 billion.", "Parent company Hutchison Whampoa to bid for one of two operators who are up for sale\n\nThree's parent's company, Hutchison Whampoa, is reportedly preparing a bid for EE or O2 following both operators confirming they were open to a sale.\n\nNews of the talks was reported by Reuters and speculation follows the news that BT was in discussions with both about a possible sale earlier this week.\n\nBT and O2 confirmed talks on Monday while EE confirmed it was in discussions on Wednesday.\n\nChinese multinational Hutchison has been active in mergers and acquisitions in recent months, finally completing a deal with Telefonica to purchase O2 Ireland for around \u00a3690 million.\n\nHow a bid by Three would be received by regulators is uncertain with Ofcom previously stating that they are happy with the UK having four operators. A purchase of BT, while creating a dominant telecoms player, would keep the current mobile landscape intact.\n\nEE has been valued by analysts at around \u00a310 billion while O2 is valued at around \u00a39 billion.", "This week has proven to be an interesting one this week for the UK wireless industry, with news coming first this week that BT were 'in talks' with Telefonica to possibly bring O2 back into the fold, buying back the network they sold to the Spanish giant almost a decade ago. If that weren't enough for BT though, EE confirmed that the two are in talks to perhaps sell their network to BT. Clearly, British Telecom is exporing their options and they're very serious about getting into the wireless market in a big way. Exploring their options however, might prove more difficult as word is that Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of Three UK, could be getting ready to make a bid for either O2 or EE.\n\nThree UK is currently the fourth largest network in the UK, but they've positioned themselves well this year, with truly unlimited data allowances and 4G at no extra cost. In fact, I recently escaped an expensive contract from O2, which offered me no 3G let alone 4G at my home, to an unlimited package from Three where I have 4G throughout my home town. If Three's owner were to buy either O2 or EE, they'd have to part with a huge amount of cash to do so, especially in the case of EE, which has become the UK's largest wireless network.\n\nReuters is reporting that Hutchison Whampoa is gearing up to make a bid for either one of the networks before the end of the year, while BT weighs up its options. However, according to sources it might not be as clean cut as that for the Chinese company, with Telefonica said to be after a \"quick, clean sale\" of O2 to BT without any antitrust blowback. Not only that, but Hutchison Whampoa has often been said to be a tough negotiator and I can't imagine either Telefonica or Deutsche Telekom and Orange (joint owners of EE) looking to sell on the cheap. These are interesting times for the UK market and no matter what happens, all of this is set to make a big impact on the market.", "BT and Three UK's owners Hutchinson Whampoa WANT to buy either O2 or Britain's largest network, EE\n\nEarlier this week word broke about BT taking an official look at purchasing either O2 or EE. The first network named in BT's quest to re-join the mobile space was O2, but shortly thereafter EE's owners confirmed they too were in preliminary talks with BT about a potential sale (EE has a market value of \u00a310 billion, while O2's is said to be closer to \u00a39 billion).\n\nThat was pretty big news, and you can read all about it below. But it is nothing compared to this next twist, which claims Three -- which is owned by Chinese Hutchinson Whampoa -- is now looking at buying either EE or O2, too. And according to The Telegraph, Three is actually preparing to bid for one of the networks.\n\n\"The Chinese company could put forward a bid for either EE or Telefonica's O2 by the end of the year as BT is expected to decide on a deal in coming weeks,\" Reuters claimed.\n\nThree -- claims the unnamed source of the material -- is best placed to acquire the UK's largest network as it already has a pretty robust infrastructure in place in the UK.\n\nNevertheless, EE's owners, Orange and Deutsche Telekom, may find it tough to agree a price as Hutchison has a reputation as a tough negotiator, Reuters added.\n\nOn the subject of Three buying out O2, Ronan Dunne, the chief executive of O2 and a member of the Telefonica executive board, isn't convinced and has publicly denounced the likelihood of Three acquiring O2 in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, Dunne said: \"Of all the scenarios in the market I think it's the least likely. At the back end of last year some analysts told me that their main prediction for this year was that Three will buy O2. All I would say is I slept very soundly that night.\"\n\nBT wants back into the mobile space. BIG TIME. And this week there's been two big stories surrounding the landline specialist buying up a network. The first report was when the telecoms giant confirmed it had its eye O2, and now additional reports have confirmed the UK phone giant is also having a look at EE too.\n\n\"EE's German and French owners confirmed on Wednesday they were in talks to sell Britain's biggest mobile network operator to BT as part of a wider review of its options,\" reports Reuters.\n\nEE holds a 33.8% share of the UK mobile space and acquiring the network could cost BT upwards of \u00a310 billion. O2 on the other hand, which has a slightly smaller share of UK punters at 26.2%, is tipped to cost around \u00a39 billion.\n\nDeutsche Telekom and Orange, the joint shareholders of EE, confirmed they \"regularly analyse the development of the market in which EE operates, evaluating various strategic options which have the potential to create value for EE's shareholders and strengthen the market position of EE\".\n\nThe group added: \"As one of these options, Deutsche Telekom and Orange are in exploratory discussions with BT, although it is too early to state whether any transaction may occur.\"\n\nReports have cited BT's desire to re-enter the mobile market as varied, although one of the big benefits is to do with \"multi-pay\" packages, whereby additional services -- TV and Film, for instance -- can be upsold to consumers as part of their mobile packages.\n\n\"BT's timing for its mobile strategy is highly questionable. BT previously sold off O2 (Cellnet) just as the UK mobile industry took off in 2002. BT now wants to buy back into O2 or EE just as the UK mobile industry is slowing down in 2014,\" Strategy Analytics' Neil Mawston told KYM. \"There are benefits. BT is obviously keen to blend a portfolio of fixed and mobile networks. Merging BT's impressive landline and broadband assets with a major mobile operator like EE would make BT a multi-platform giant for businesses and consumers in the UK.\"\n\nHe added: \"Whether BT could successfully merge EE or O2 UK under the BT umbrella remains to be seen. Merging BT with EE or O2 UK would clearly take several years of effort. Keeping all the fixed and mobile operations sustainably profitable in such a crowded UK market in the future is open to question. UK and EU regulators will also be paying close attention, and giant BT may struggle to get the takeover of a mobile operator authorized without concessions.\"\n\nHandsets and tablets are increasingly becoming hubs for content, and the ability to stream media around the home using things like Chromecast will help this trend to develop further in the coming year. This transition allows operators to work direct with service providers -- people like Sky, Spotify and Netflix, for instance -- in order to offer more compelling data services.\n\nThe downside associated with such a move would be that BT might be perceived to have too much power, controlling phone lines, a large swathe of the UK's internet and then mobile data, too. This could be seen as the company having something of a monopoly in the UK and that could be bad for competition, resulting in consumers' could losing out as a result.\n\nBeyond this, there are other issues too: do you want BT providing services for your TV, phone, Internet and landline? It's a bit much, to be fair but there are potential positives too. For instance, the addition of a mobile network into the mix could, in theory, allow BT to bring to market new \"types\" of data and call plans for the whole family as well as individuals and businesses.", "The chief executive of O2 has said that a takeover of the operator by Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of rival mobile operator Three, is the \"least likely\" of all the possible mergers that could take place in the telecoms sector.\n\nIt was reported on Thursday that Hutchison is working with advisers on a potential takeover of EE or O2.\n\nBut last week Ronan Dunne, the chief executive of O2 and a member of the Telefonica executive board, poured scorn on the idea of a combination with Three.\n\nHe said: \"Of all the scenarios in the market I think it's the least likely.\n\n\"At the back end of last year some analysts told me that their main prediction for this year was that Three will buy O2. All I would say is I slept very soundly that night.\"\n\nBT fired the starting gun on a race to combine mobile, fixed line and pay-TV assets on Monday when it confirmed it was in talks to acquire either O2, from its Spanish parent company Telefonica, or another mobile operator. The second target was quickly confirmed as EE, owned by Orange and Deutsche Telekom.\n\nBT's proposed move into mobile is expected to spark a wave of consolidation. Whichever operator BT does not buy is considered likely to seek an alternative tie-up as soon as possible.\n\nMr Dunne said a merger of mobile operators was unlikely, but analysts believe deals with BT's fixed-line rivals are possible.\n\nThe O2 chief executive said: \"My personal view is that four to three in the UK is unlikely.\n\n\"It's a viable market for the number of operators in it.\"\n\nAn acquisition of either O2 or EE by Hutchison would mean Britons would have the choice of only three main mobile operators. Such reductions in competition have been allowed in smaller European markets, such as Ireland, and in Germany with conditions attached.\n\nIt is understood that British regulators see four mobile operators as preferable.\n\nBritain's four mobile operators have also paired up by forming mast-sharing partnerships designed to reduced the costs of building their networks. Three is in partnership with EE. This means a combination with O2, which shares masts with Vodafone, would be complicated.\n\nMr Dunne made his comments at a dinner with the media last week, before BT's takeover talks were revealed.", "Black Friday comes to web development and design deals, here is a list of 11 exclusive deals for some of the best tools you should be using.\n\nThemeco has long been providing the Ultimate WordPress Theme in X, and with their new X 3.0 they are ready to take things to a whole new level.

Shortly after EE revealed that it had also held preliminary talks with BT about a possible sale.\n\nNow Reuters reports that Hutchison Whampoa, which owns UK network 3, is preparing its own bid for either EE or O2 in an attempt to stop BT expanding its already dominant landline network into the mobile realm.\n\nThe site adds that BT is currently weighing up whether to \"stretch\" itself to buy EE, which is the UK's biggest mobile network, or to settle with O2, the second biggest and apparently the \"simpler option\". It would also avoid the potential antitrust issues posed by the size of a joined BT and EE.", "Hutchison Whampoa, which owns mobile operator Three UK, is preparing a bid for mobile operators EE or O2, currently in exploratory talks about selling their operations to BT, several people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Hutchison could make an offer for either company by the end of the year, as BT is expected to decide on a deal within weeks. Hutchison, which according to the sources is working on the deal with a consultancy, was not available to comment. Telefonica, which wants to sell O2 to repay debt, could sell to Hutchison if a deal with BT falls through. O2, valued at GBP 9.4 billion, would also be less expensive than EE, at EUR 22 billion.", "Three's parent company Hutchinson Whampoa allegedly planning bid for O2 or EE\n\nBT's plan for expansion into the consumer mobile market could be in danger of being hijacked by one of its' largest rivals, reports have claimed.\n\nChinese telecommunications giant Hutchinson Whampoa, the parent company of UK mobile operator Three, is planning a bid for either EE or O2, the companies courted by BT, according to sources close to the matter.\n\nHutchison has yet to comment on the story.\n\nCombination\n\nThe private talks are reportedly under way at the moment, but O2, as the larger company, is thought to be the more attractive proposition for both Hutchinson and BT. However, a deal with EE, the UK's largest mobile operator, could work out better for Hutchison, especially as the companies already have a network sharing agreement deal in the UK, the sources said.\n\nBT confirmed last week that it was in talks with O2's parent company Telefonica regarding a possible sale of the operator as it looks to launch consumer mobile services sometime next year. Such a deal would mark a significant volte-face for BT, which span off originally sold off O2 (which was formerly known as BT Cellnet) for \u00a317.7 billion in 2005.\n\nBT currently provides backhaul services to O2 but overlooked the operator as a potential MVNO partner, instead opting for EE as part of its plans to launch consumer mobile services from early next year.\n\nIt is unclear how any takeover would impact the latter deal, especially as EE, formed as a joint venture between Orange and T-Mobile, confirmed earlier this week that it was discussing a possible sale with BT.\n\nThree, which is the UK's fourth largest mobile operator behind O2, EE and Vodafone, has enjoyed significant growth this year. In its half yearly results, the company announced operating profits of \u00a3123 million, with the operator seeing growth in both the number of customers and the amount of data being used.\n\nThe company also recently signed a deal with Carphone Warehouse which looks to launch a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using Three's infrastructure. It is understood that Three has been strengthened by the 800MHz spectrum it acquired in the Ofcom 4G auction last year and could be open to more MVNO agreements.\n\nWhat do you know about BT?

The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 0.1 per cent in the morning trading.\n\nA spokesman for Hutchison said the company declined to comment.\n\nLi's overseas investments has repeatedly stoked talk that he is divesting from Hong Kong. He has repeatedly denied the allegation.\n\nIf Hutchison's bid proceeds, it would be a major coup for the company's growing European telecommunications operations known as \"3 Group Europe\". Its mobile services in Britain, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Austria had a total subscriber base of 26.9 million at the end of June.\n\n\"Hutchison has long been interested in the opportunities from the consolidation of Europe's telecommunications industry. So this reported bid for either EE or O2 is consistent with its strategy over the past several years,\" Daiwa analyst Jason Kan said.\n\n\"So far, Hutchison has not made a really large-scale investment in Europe. This could be a very sizable project, but the company has the financial resources to do it.\"\n\nEE, owned by Orange and Deutsche Telekom, is Britain's largest mobile network operator and valued at 11 billion pounds (HK$133.93 billion), while second-ranked O2 is worth about 9.4 billion pounds.\n\nIn July this year, Hutchison completed its 780-million euro (HK$7.5 billion) takeover of Spanish group Telefonica's O2 mobile business in Ireland. It is set to make 70 million euros in deferred payment upon reaching certain financial targets.\n\nPrior to that acquisition, Hutchison had spent more than 800 million euros in developing its Irish mobile operations.\n\nThe company closed its 1.3 billion-euro purchase of wireless carrier Orange Austria in January last year.\n\nXiang Ligang, the founder of information technology and telecommunications portal CCTime in Beijing, said it makes sense for Hutchison to acquire a British telecommunications firm based on its experience in the industry.\n\nHe said telecommunications companies are still very profitable, although profit margins might be slipping.\n\n\"I believe Hutchison will achieve two things through such an acquisition,\" Xiang said. \"First is users. Second is spectrum,\" he said.\n\nSpectrum is usually auctioned, and the market price keeps rising. \"Through acquisition, Hutchison may secure spectrum resources with smaller costs,\" he added.\n\nHutchison had earlier paid 225 million pounds in license fees for the radio frequency spectrum it won in Britain's 4G mobile auction in 2012.\n\nHutchison last year saw negotiations collapse for a potential merger of its Three Italia subsidiary and the wireless division of Telecom Italia, the country's biggest fixed-line and mobile network operator.\n\nAt the end of June, 3 Group Europe recorded a 3 per cent year on year increase in first-half revenue to HK$31.06 billion.\n\nHutchison's interim report said 3 Group Europe is expected \"to further increase its contribution to the [conglomerate's] overall results due to the division's highly competitive network assets and ... synergies from the recently completed acquisitions in Austria and Ireland\".", "LONDON (Alliance News) - Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, the Chinese owner of the Three mobile network, is preparing to make a bid for EE Ltd or O2, the mobile groups currently involved in potential takeover talks with BT Group PLC, Reuters reported Thursday.\n\nReuters said the company may make a bid for either EE, which is owned by Orange SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, or O2, owned by Spanish telecoms group Telefonica SA, by the end of the year, citing several sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBT is expected to decide on whether it will pursue a deal with either O2 or EE in coming weeks.\n\nhttp://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/27/uk-hutchisonwhampoa-ee-o2-exclusive-idUKKCN0JB25F20141127\n\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance\n\nCopyright 2014 Alliance News Limited.

The new Lux bulbs don't change their hue, ironically, but they provide a warm white glow with all the geofencing, remote control and manual brightness options of the rest of the series at half the price per bulb.\n\nSpeaking of Hue, they can be controlled by the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home system, which includes a physical remote with touchscreen, as well as a hub that can connect to apps on your iOS and Android devices. Because you're talking to the hub, and then to the lights, there's sometimes some input lag, but it's still very convenient to use the same remote to control your home entertainment system, lighting, and Nest thermostat.\n\nSpeaking of Nest, their learning thermostat is still the best in the biz, with compatibility with a range of devices, including the aforementioned Logitech Harmony remote, connected appliances and the Dropcam security solution, which Google acquired in addition to Nest this year.\n\nSpeaking of Dropcam, they make the best connected video camera solution available, with cloud storage of recordings, remote control, geofences, scheduling and more. They look good, too, so you won't have to turn your house into something out of a surveillance state fever dream to make use of them.\n\nBack to Philips, the company makes a new lightswitch for its Hue products that has a couple of neat features - including power via kinetic energy storage, meaning it requires no batteries and you give it all the power it needs to operate just by using it. It also comes with a mounting plate that it can easily be removed from, so that you can carry it with you and have control wherever you are in your house, without even needing your smartphone.\n\nThis new Wi-Fi doorbell is shipping soon, and it's a good pick because the team has already had one kick and the can and came away with some valuable lessons.

Cloud storage company Box is taking a 334,000-square-foot office building going up on the former Malibu Grand Prix site in Redwood City as its new headquarters and subleasing its old headquarters in Los Altos. RingCentral, a cloud phone vendor, is moving into an 84,000-square-foot space in Belmont, and Rakuten, a fast-growing Japanese e-commerce company, just signed a lease for 57,000 square feet in the city of San Mateo.\n\n\"There are others out in the market looking for space, between 12,000 and 1 million square feet,\" said Bob Garner, executive managing director at commercial real estate broker Newmark Cornish & Carey in San Mateo.\n\nSome are already looking at a site where Seabiscuit won races in the 1930s and Willie Shoemaker began his career in the 1940s. Ground is being broken next week on the first of five office buildings totaling up to 1.5 million square feet in a development dubbed Bay Meadows Station 4. It's the first commercial development of its kind at the former site of 74-year-old Bay Meadows racetrack, now an 83-acre master-planned community with some townhomes, condos, parks and a high school already open.\n\n\"We're very bullish on the area, from office to residential. It's right in the heart of things in the Bay Area, between San Francisco and San Jose,\" said Janice Thacher, partner at San Francisco's Wilson Meany, the project's master developer, in partnership with San Francisco real estate investment firm Stockbridge Capital Group.\n\nWhen completed, on a date to be determined, the \"urban village\" will house up to 1,250 residential units, retail outlets, 18 public parks, a community garden and open space. The first 210,000-square-foot office building is scheduled to be complete in July 2016. Neither Thacher nor Garner, whose firm is the project's leasing agent, would disclose the names of potentially interested tenants, but said there is already quite a bit of \"activity.\"\n\n\"Primarily technology. I'd say 70 percent, plus life sciences and a little bit of services,\" said Garner, when asked which sectors are scouting the area.\n\nWith stratospherically priced San Francisco running out of space, and more tech workers looking to live and work closer to San Francisco than the southern Peninsula, the interest in San Mateo is not surprising. San Mateo County, population 750,000, also has a lot of what these companies are looking for: being in the northern part of Silicon Valley; intersecting highways connecting San Francisco, San Jose and the East Bay; Caltrain (which runs from San Francisco through San Jose); and a port in Redwood City, the county seat.\n\n\"From there it's 25 miles to San Francisco, 25 miles to San Jose and minutes to Stanford,\" said Rosanne Foust, CEO of the San Mateo County Economic Development Association. \"It's got access to capital, educational resources and good quality of life.\"\n\nInvestors and developers appear to have gotten the message. Commercial real estate is seeing \"dramatic rent increases and a wave of speculative development not seen in years,\" according to Colliers International's third quarter real estate report.\n\n\"Speculative development\" means proceeding with a project on unused land, assuming its value will increase. It got a drubbing during the Great Recession, but has returned in the San Francisco-San Jose corridor, powered largely by the explosion of tech. \"That's what was most interesting to me about the Bay Meadows project,\" said Foust. \"Nothing had been built for years on spec. They must have known the lay of the land.\"\n\n\"Let's say it wasn't necessarily our plan all along,\" said Thacher, \"but given how dynamic the market is and the demand for space, getting out in front of it seemed important.\" So, presumably did Kilroy Realty, which developed the twin office building snapped up by Box on spec.\n\nAirport hotel\n\nSan Francisco International Airport has also taken notice. It is evaluating bids to operate a 350-room, \"four-star or five-star\" hotel it plans to build on airport property by 2018, on account of the increasing domestic and overseas traffic it expects, and an \"analysis of the landscape telling us why, with the available capacity on the Peninsula, a hotel of that standard would work,\" said SFO spokesman Doug Yakel.\n\nFour- and five-star hotels aren't cheap. Neither are the offerings at Bay Meadows, at least compared with what it cost to play the ponies there back in the day. Two-bedroom homes go for $800,000 to $1 million. Class A offices are going for \"just under $4 per square foot,\" said Thacher. That's slightly less than the average asking rent on the Peninsula, but a deal compared to San Francisco's $59 per square foot, according to Collier's latest report.\n\nIf former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong is reading this, he's entitled to some schadenfreude. Wong wanted to relocate Reddit's headquarters from San Francisco's South of Market district to a new Class A office building in Daly City ($45 per square feet), right off Interstate 280, and a couple of blocks from BART. That led to his resignation this month over what he described in a blog post as \"strategic disagreement\" over the move. In other words, probably a staff rebellion something along the lines of: why would we work there?\n\n\"If the job had been a energizing one rather than one that had been so draining, this probably wouldn't have been an issue I resigned over,\" Wong wrote. \"But it was, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't relieved to have the burden off my shoulders,\" he said.", "Bing has become the latest search engine to abide by the so-called 'right to be forgotten' whereby search engine removal requests must be considered from users.

Name a web success created by either. By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. Nov. 28, 2014 6:02 p.m. ET\n\nA resolution by the European Parliament calling for the breakup of Google and other U.S. Web giants is a sad joke, although Google's struggles with European antitrust authorities have been no laughing matter. These battles include the absurd \"right to be forgotten\" mandate as well as rising calls in French and German government ranks for sanctions power to force the \"unbundling\" of the amalgam of applications that a Google or Facebook or Amazon represents.\n\nPeter Thiel , the venture capitalist who has lately taken on a prophetic mien, has warned for months that Washington underestimates the European Union's war on Silicon Valley. Thursday's vote was a confirmation.\n\nENLARGE Reuters\n\nNot that the European Parliament itself isn't a joke, a dumping ground for has-beens and sinecure for wannabes who aren't up for political careers of real substance, which still happen in the sovereign home parliaments of member countries.\n\nAndreas Schwab, the German member who drafted the resolution, is a lawyer who works with a law firm that represents German media interests that have been suing Google, hoping to get paid when their published stories end up in search results.\n\nMr. Schwab's parliamentary colleagues made their own no-brainer calculation (perhaps the only kind many are capable of) when they passed his nonbinding gesture 384 to 174. Local media bosses are appeased at minimum cost. The resolution doesn't actually mention Google, Facebook, Amazon or Apple by name, all influential companies whose favor might be useful one day.\n\nWhat's really ailing the Continent was best indicated by the accompanying rhetoric. Said German member Evelyne Gebhardt : \"European policy makers must directly support European innovation, and particularly new startups, in order to foster their potential.\"\n\nIf this is the quality of understanding on which its economic future depends, Europe might as well start passing out the euthanasia vouchers right now.\n\nThat so many of the Web companies that \"dominate the everyday lives of Europeans,\" as Ms. Gebhardt frets, originate in the U.S. owes exactly nothing to the U.S. government identifying and fostering the potential of startups.\n\nGoogle rightly says competition is only a click away: In its short life, Google has seen much of its potential market clicked away by companies whose arrival was unpredictable, such as Yelp, Twitter , Facebook, WhatsApp and an amazingly reinvented Apple.\n\nContributing next to nothing to this explosion of wealth has been the European Union. Germany and France are the core powers of the EU, the world's No. 4 and 5 economies. Name a single major Web-era success that emerged from either.\n\nLet's amend that: These countries do produce cutting-edge entrepreneurs, engineers and creative talents, who can be found by the thousands in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking of sad and pathetic, even as Europe takes aim at Silicon Valley, apparently dropped from the agenda is what was supposed to be its well-developed antitrust case against Russia's Gazprom .\n\nGazprom is a monopoly of the malign textbook definition, using its pricing power and energy-starvation threats to prevent client countries from developing alternate suppliers. Gazprom's monopoly is detrimental to European consumers in every way, driving up energy prices and driving manufacturing jobs to the U.S. to benefit from cheap shale gas.\n\nNot only is Gazprom an untrustworthy supplier, it's an instrument of Vladimir Putin 's retrograde and militaristic foreign policy. So the European Parliament declares war on Google.\n\nA word about innovation: There is little natural constituency for the future in democratic politics, where, by definition, established voting blocs and donor interests and media alliances are those that represent the past. That's true in foreign policy too. A question has to be asked: Does it make sense for America to be strategically invested in European allies who have so clearly put themselves on an economic, cultural and demographic road to oblivion? It would be sad to write off a continent that has contributed so much to mankind's advancement, but maybe that's what the European Parliament is inviting us to do.", "THESE are dark days for the shaving industry. After experiencing a century of fairly steady growth, makers of razors and other shaving equipment have seen revenues level off or fall in the last few years. Beards are back.\n\nOne striking feature of this resurgence is that for the first time in well over a century, a growing number of the world's business leaders are sporting facial hair. Google's co-founder Sergey Brin, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Salesforce, are just a few prominent examples.\n\nIt's easy to view the bearded business leader as a mere extension of the overall beard trend, or yet another sign that work environments are becoming more casual. But the tangled history of facial hair and capitalism suggests that deeper forces are at work.\n\nHistorically, beards in the boardroom have been a barometer of the relative vitality of capitalism and its critics. When capitalism has assumed a more swashbuckling, individualistic persona, hair has sprouted on the chins of entrepreneurs and speculators. But when forces bent on destroying capitalism have been ascendant -- or when well-regulated, faceless corporations have defined economic life -- beards have waned.\n\nFor most of the modern era, beards and mustaches grew only at the margins of society. In the United States, the founding fathers eschewed facial hair. The same cleanshaven look prevailed throughout Europe among the capitalist classes.\n\nIn Europe in the 1830s and 1840s, socialists, Chartists and other critics of capitalism began growing beards. As a young man, Friedrich Engels, who would go on to write \"The Communist Manifesto\" with Karl Marx, organized a \"moustache evening\" among his friends to taunt cleanshaven bourgeois \"philistinism.\" Marx himself cultivated a huge beard and thick mustache. A Prussian spy later sent to keep tabs on him reported with a mixture of awe and anxiety: \"His hair and beard are quite black. The latter he does not shave.\"\n\nBeards were scary to capitalists. But after reactionaries crushed the violent uprisings of 1848 in Continental Europe, the threat of what the Times of London described that year as \"foreign bearded propagandists\" began receding in the capitalist imagination. In response, beards started to make inroads among the defenders of free enterprise in Britain and the United States. As one historian of the hirsute, Christopher Oldstone-Moore of Wright State University, has concluded, \"fearful associations of facial hair dissolved, and respectable men were at liberty to let their beards grow.\"\n\nIndeed, beards became an emblem of bourgeois masculinity. Proponents of the new \"beard movement\" (yes, it was called that) argued that \"the bondage of the beard to the dictatorship of an effeminate fashion\" had yielded a world of \"woman-faced men.\"\n\nMany factors contributed to this trend. In the United States, the gold rush that began in 1849 threw countless middle-class men into a get-rich-quick world of prospecting where shaving was discretionary. The Civil War must also be credited, as wide-eyed boys went off to war cleanshaven and returned as bearded men.\n\nNotably, this is when we witness the rise of facial hair as an essential accouterment of the capitalist class. Jay Gould, the most feared financier of the era, grew a beard that concealed most of his face, making an already inscrutable countenance even more difficult to read. Other robber barons followed suit.\n\nThese men didn't view themselves as conformists, much less corporate drones, but as rugged individualists who single-handedly built vast business empires. Their beards became part of their larger-than-life brand. Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Carnegie, Collis P. Huntington, William Henry Vanderbilt and almost every other member of the vilified capitalist class sported extravagant facial hair.\n\nBut nothing lasts forever. From the 1870s onward, as the workers' rebellion revived internationally, a new wave of labor radicals sported long, unruly beards. In the popular press, as the conflict between labor and capital turned increasingly violent in the 1880s, facial hair became a shorthand for the forcible resistance to capitalism. Illustrated newspapers covering the Haymarket bombing in 1886 in Chicago showed radicals wearing unkempt, tangled beards.\n\nCartoonists soon began depicting labor, and strikers in particular, as modern-day Samsons, pulling down the columns of an orderly society, killing their capitalist adversaries and themselves in the process. One barber quoted by this newspaper around the turn of the century put the matter bluntly, when describing various \"cranks\" and radicals: \"They carry their banners on their faces, proclaiming them Populists or Anarchists, or some other sort of ists.\"\n\nMost \"respectable\" men, including capitalists, ran from this image. While the invention of the safety razor by King C. Gillette in 1901 is often blamed for the demise of the beard, businessmen (and labor leaders eager to avoid the taint of radicalism) had already gone for a neatly trimmed mustache before going entirely cleanshaven by the dawn of the new century. The changing fashion may also have reflected a shift away from the untrammeled, individualistic capitalism of the Gilded Age to something more corporate, faceless -- and beardless.\n\nIn succeeding decades, beards and mustaches all but disappeared. The organization man of 20th-century America was cast as cleanshaven, his individuality subsumed into a larger, corporate identity. Iconic critics of capitalism -- Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh -- kept alive the identification of facial hair with leftist politics.\n\nBut with the end of the Cold War and the defeat of Communism, the groundwork for a scruffy capitalism was laid. In the semiotics of capital today, whiskers no longer code as a threat. With free market ideology essentially unopposed by any major power and energized by the entrepreneurial swagger of the technology world, beards are back in business.", "Vote for the top prep football helmet among Higgins, De La Salle, East Ascension, Byrd\n\nFollow Pat Mashburn as he covers the action with live updates from the No.6 Plain Dealing-No. 3 West St. John at West St. John in a Class 1A semifinal playoff game.

But it was approved with a large majority - 384 votes to 174, with 56 abstentions - showing widespread political backing.\n\nEU Digital Economy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger underscored the resolution was \"an important expression of opinion\" but he added the EU was far from tearing digital multinationals apart.\n\n\"I don't think, at the end of the day, that the breaking up as such is what we can expect,\" Oettinger said.\n\n\"Rather we are talking about the consistent and correct implementation of EU legislation to ensure that the interests\" of EU businesses and consumers are maintained.\n\nEU antitrust authorities are currently investigating Google to see whether it is abusing its position following allegations it is biased in linking search results to its own services.\n\nCompetitors in Europe, where Google has an Internet search market share of about 90 percent, have complained about the way the company gives preference to its own Google-branded services at the top of search result pages, especially when consumers are likely to be searching for something to buy.\n\nThe EU Commission made it clear that the resolution will not have an impact on the investigation into Google.\n\nOn Wednesday, an EU data protection group advised that \"the right to be forgotten\" rule - which requires Google to delete upon request information that unfairly tarnishes an individual's reputation - should be expanded to the general .com domains.\n\nThe purge of search results currently applies to Google's local search pages covering the EU's 28 member nations and four other European countries, encompassing more than 500 million people. Those who switch to the firm's American domain, Google.com, can find unaltered search results.", "Robert Downey Jr. learned a very important lesson on Friday - Google yourself at your own risk.\n\nThe 49-year-old actor was apparently surprised by what he found when he decided to recently Google himself, according to a recent post on his official Facebook page.\n\n\"HA! This is what happens when you google yourself, kids...\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr. stumbled across an artistic illustration of Marvel fan fiction that pairs Tony Stark (also known as Iron Man) with none other than Loki in a way that was definitely not typed into the Avengers movie script.\n\nTony Stark and Loki?\n\nAside from the message posted with the picture, Robert Downey Jr. did not disclose or confirm any further details about the picture.\n\nHowever, the watermark in the lower left-hand corner of the picture is from \"TABBY STARDUST.\"\n\nA Google search for Tabby Stardust leads to a Live Journal account named \"Stark Industries.\" The same exact illustration that Robert Downey Jr. posted on his Facebook page Friday was originally posted on this Live Journal account back in June.\n\nAccording to the website, the title of the illustration is \"The Abyss.\" As a warning for the content, this Marvel fanfiction of Robert Downey Jr and Tom Hiddleston as their respective characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is listed as \"non-con, bondage.\"\n\nThe brief description posted on the site adds a bit of a back story to the illustration.\n\n\"Loki has captured Tony and plans to do nasty things to him.\"\n\nClearly, this particular story line has hardly anything to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (or even the official comic books). However, that is the basic concept of fanfiction, isn't it? Placing complete creative control into the hands of the fans?\n\nIt is clear that Tabby Stardust did just that with this illustration of Tony Stark in a bondage situation while Loki grabs his hair with his left hand and armpit with his right hand while whispering in his ear.\n\nBefore you start to write this off as just another great drawing, keep in mind that fanfiction has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years - opening quite a few doors of opportunity for the people that create it.\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, Anna Todd was able to secure a six-figure book deal from her popular fanfiction about One Direction.\n\nBy getting a major boost in exposure from Robert Downey Jr. and his Facebook fan base of more than 22.8 million likes, \"Tabby Stardust\" might get a chance to experience similar success with their own work.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[Image Credit: Tech Times]", "Microsoft 's Bing and Yahoo have started to scrub search results for Europeans who want to exercise their \"right to be forgotten,\" company officials said.\n\nSo far, all eyes have been on Google, which has led the way in implementing a European court decision in May that said people had the right to ask for information about them to be removed from search results. But the decision also extends to search engines such as Bing and Yahoo.\n\nGoogle began to remove links in June and has served as a test for how companies should implement the ruling from the European Court of Justice. The court, which ruled in favor of a Spanish man who sued Google, didn't explain how companies were supposed to decide whether to approve requests. The court said there needed to be a balance between an individual's right to privacy and the public's right to know.\n\nGoogle also created an advisory council that held a series of public meetings on the topic. \"We want to strike this balance right,\" the advisory council says on its website. \"This obligation is a new and difficult challenge for us, and we're seeking advice on the principles Google ought to apply when making decisions on individual cases.\"\n\nAs it started pruning search results, Google was criticized for notifying publishers when links to their content had been removed. By telling publishers, Google was in effect drawing more attention to content that someone wanted to keep private. In some cases, newspapers wrote stories about the removals that recapped the original stories.\n\nA group of European privacy regulators on Wednesday said search engines shouldn't regularly notify publishers or Web hosts of the original content.\n\nGoogle also began publishing data about the number of requests it receives, along with some anonymized examples of requests. As of Tuesday, Google had removed more than 208,000 links from search results, out of more than 602,000 it has reviewed for removal. Nearly 294,500 link removal requests were rejected, and Google has yet to decide what to do about 99,500 links.\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo haven't gone into detail about their processes.\n\n\"We will carefully evaluate each request with the goal of balancing the individual's right to privacy with considerations of the public's right to information,\" a Yahoo spokeswoman said.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman issued a similar statement: \"While we're still refining that process, our goal is to strike a satisfactory balance between individual privacy interests and the public's interest in free expression.\"\n\nReputation VIP, a French company that created a portal for people to submit removal requests, said it had received notices from Microsoft that 79 requests were denied so far out of 699 submitted through the company since late July. It isn't clear whether Microsoft made decisions on the other requests.\n\nOf the 79 rejections, 77 were for links to information on social media. In a message sent along with the decision, Microsoft said the person should use content-removal tools available through the social-media publisher. \"These tools and processes may be the most effective way for you to remove social-media content from search results,\" the message said, according to Reputation VIP.", "\"You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it.\" -- Bill Cosby\n\nA little over a month ago, a quick search for \"Bill Cosby\" on the Internet could have given you a toothache.\n\nDoting references to Cosby as a \"pioneering comedian\" and \"all-around joyful fellow\" would have popped up on the first page of Google results in honor of his \"genial\" and \"beloved\" personality. The moniker, \"America's Dad,\" was practically etched in stone.\n\nThat's all changed amid renewed allegations that Cosby has -- for decades -- repeatedly used drugs and alcohol to sedate women into submitting to his sexual whims.\n\nDate rape is no laughing matter, and the irony of this is not lost on the public. Only rarely does the media and blogosphere seem so united in endorsing a brutal shaming in the court of public opinion.\n\nWhether or not the allegations are legitimate, the persona of Bill Cosby is not. He is simply not funny anymore.\n\nIf there is a positive takeaway, it is this: Like a slap in the face, public awareness is at an all-time high, and universal condemnation of rape, date rape, sexual assault, and violence is nearing the point of zero tolerance.\n\nIn contrast to the defensiveness displayed by Janay Rice, for instance, the victims in this case seem to have no interest in forestalling justice even if the statute of limitations has run out.\n\nTheir statements are nothing short of courageous, and this invites the possibility that future generations of women will find the strength to report incidents earlier on.\n\nThis, of course, is the singular impetus for change in matters of sexual assault: Early reporting is the only way the legal system can gather tangible evidence and separate fact from fiction to prosecute perpetrators in a court of law.\n\nAnd yet, on a psychological level, America faces a more peculiar dilemma: In Hollywood -- the land of make-believe -- it's nearly impossible to separate fact from fiction.\n\nHe was so persuasive in his \"The Cosby Show\" interpretation of Cliff Huxtable that the character took on a life of its own.\n\nCosby created a mythical father figure so fanciful -- so idyllic -- we accepted it as mythology.\n\nHuxtable was Hector in Homer's Iliad -- defender of his people but devoid of the darker impulses that characterized his contemporaries.\n\nHe was a peaceful father and husband, and his agenda was unification. Hector, like Huxtable, was a mediator in a world that seemed black and white. Huxtable, like Hector, was a hero.\n\nThe heroism of Huxtable, however, had an inherent flaw. Huxtable was entwined with the mortal Cosby, and Cosby (it seems) is no god.\n\nHuxtable was so powerful that he seemed impenetrable, and this facilitated the sinister leanings of Cosby himself. It's hard to argue with a god, particularly one so beloved. But it was only a matter of time before the veneer of grandeur began to crack.\n\nWe (Americans) were unwilling to acknowledge the fractures until now. The undoing of Cosby is so difficult to digest precisely because we have been unable to separate man from god.\n\nComedian Hannibal Buress, the person somewhat responsible for bringing this story back to the news (NSFW), probably never envisioned that his comedy set would have prompted the backlash it did. He described Cosby's image as \"Teflon\" in the public eye.\n\nStrangely for us, the mythology was exposed. Huxtable, it seems, is no Teflon -- he is imitation, to say the least.\n\nIf anything should give us pause, it is that Cosby is, like any individual, capable of cruelty, and even self-destruction, by his own choices. Choices are truly the Achilles heel of any mortal and the responsibility of man.\n\nThat, if anything, is the indestructible lesson here.", "13 CONNECT 41 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. - You're in the market for a laptop as a gift, and wondering about those seemingly too good to be true deals - the $200 and $300 Google Chromebook. Are they worth it for the student in your life?\n\nI've been playing with several models this year, and the answer is an enthusiastic yes.\n\nChromebooks have greatly improved since they first started appearing in 2012, and Google has gone a long way to addressing the negatives.\n\nUSATODAY\n\nHoliday Gift Guide\n\nCompared to tablets - which are generally more expensive - Chromebooks are a better deal. They're nice and light, and come with a keyboard.\n\nThe benefit of the Chromebook of course is the amazing cost. While Apple laptops start at $899 and good Windows laptops are usually in the $400-$600 range, Chromebooks are always less. For instance, I just tested a $329 Toshiba CB35 with 13.3-inch screen, 1080p HD resolution, full size keyboard and stereo speakers from Skullcandy.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSeriously splurgy tech gifts: Bionic bike and more\n\nThe thing about Google Chromebooks, which run on Google's Chrome operating system, is that initially you had to be online if you wanted to use it. That meant finding an Internet signal to write e-mail, documents, surf the Web, edit photos and more. Which was fine if you're home, in school, at Starbucks or wherever.\n\nBut that's changing.\n\nGoogle has improved the value proposition, with apps that let you do Gmail and Docs (its answer to Microsoft Office) offline, and even download movies and TV shows from the Google Play store to watch wherever - like on long plane rides with no Internet signal.\n\nThe Chromebooks have very limited hard drive space (the Toshiba has 16 GB, compared to the 500 GB to 1 terabyte found on most Apple and Windows laptops) and all software choices have to come through the Chrome app store.\n\nThe two features that matter to me - editing photos and videos - have been tough with the Chromebook.\n\nThere are simple photo apps that let you crop, change exposure and add Instagram-like filters (I like Pixlr), but they're not the full Photoshop experience I expect.\n\nGood news on that front too. Adobe recently announced a deal with Google to test a Chromebook version of Photoshop for students.\n\nIt's in the early stages, and wasn't available for review, but it's a great move forward.\n\nThe video apps I've used are similar to the bare bones, automatic tools you find in smartphone and tablet apps. You can make simple edits and add graphics, but you can't do the kind of full-featured video editing I like to do in a major program like Apple's Final Cut Pro, or even Adobe's consumer Premiere Elements.\n\nBut you're not here to buy a Chromebook for me. For the student in your life, or for a second or third laptop around the house, the Chromebook is easily the most affordable option out there, and one worth considering amidst all the crazy sales.\n\nFollow Jefferson Graham on Twitter.\n\n13 CONNECT 41 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ryAtzd", "What are you thankful for this year?\n\nThe data team at Facebook analyzed the posts of English speakers in the United States, and they created a map of the most distinctive thing they found in each state.\n\nThey also broke down the maps by several broad trends.

In the case of Atherton's 87 Nora Way, an owner elected partway through the remodel of a ranch home on the half-acre lot to sell to a local development company.\n\n\"When we bought it, our aim was to create an inviting, luxurious space for a family who wants to live in Atherton without spending tens of millions of dollars to do so,\" said Pete Samis, a builder for Silicon Valley Development.\n\nInspiration for the exterior came from an award-winning home in Nevada, Samis said, while the interior embraces an open floor plan with multiple access points to a central courtyard.\n\nStacked Virginia Ledgestone, stucco and cedar converge to craft sleek curb appeal to the western-facing four bedroom. The same type of stacked stones lend continuity to the interior. The earth-toned and rust-hued rocks serve as a surround for the great room's gas fireplace and media center, as well as trim in the adjacent kitchen.\n\nAside from the aforementioned stone accents, 16-foot soffit ceilings, horizontal windows and a massive glass pocket door encompass the great room. The high-tech kitchen revolves around a center island with breakfast bar that includes built-in ovens and a range.\n\nA serene courtyard designed to mute the neighborhood traffic sits beyond the great room's sliding glass doors. Both the master suite and a guest bedroom come with glass pocket doors of their own.\n\nBathrooms tend to be places where builders, designers and architects showcase their style -- and this Atherton home is no different. Curbless walk-in glass showers include trough drains and multiple body sprayers. Thermostatically heated tile floors eliminate a jarring sensation on cold mornings, and floating vanities are topped with quartz counters.\n\nBoth inside and out, the soothing gurgle from water features welcomes meditation and serenity.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Atherton has outpaced the rest of the Bay Area and the most exclusive neighborhoods in Miami and New York to become the most expensive ZIP code in America, according to Forbes.\n\nTwenty-four homes listed this summer had a median price of roughly $9 million, the financial magazine showed. Atherton attracts wealthy buyers not only because of its proximity to the headquarters of Google, Apple and Facebook, but also a permitting process that's generally viewed as less cumbersome than other parts of the Bay Area.\n\nFeatures: A great room with 16-foot soffit ceilings, wall of water and stacked Virginia Ledgestone accents serves as the focal point of this newly built 5,052-square-foot four-bedroom. Three sets of glass pocket doors throughout the home open to a courtyard, and the bathrooms offer floating vanities and thermostatically heated tile floors.", "Lawsuit says Cox blew off copyright notices from two Rightscorp clients.\n\nBMG Rights Management and Round Hill Music have sued Cox Communications for copyright infringement, arguing that the Internet service provider doesn't do enough to punish those who download music illegally.\n\nBoth BMG and Round Hill are clients of Rightscorp, a copyright enforcement agent whose business is based on threatening ISPs with a high-stakes lawsuit if they don't forward settlement notices to users that Rightscorp believes are \"repeat infringers\" of copyright.\n\nThere's little precedent for a lawsuit trying to hold an ISP responsible for users engaged in piracy.

It's one thing to terminate an account on YouTube, but cable subscribers can pay well over $100 per month -- and BMG and Round Hill claim that they've notified Cox about 200,000 repeat infringers on its network.\n\nIn their complaint (PDF), the music publishers describe the Cox network as an out-of-control den of piracy. \"Today, BitTorrent systems are like the old P2P systems on steroids,\" BMG lawyers write. \"Despite its published policy to the contrary, Cox's actual policy is to refuse to suspend, terminate, or otherwise penalize subscriber accounts that repeatedly commit copyright infringement through its network in any meaningful numbers.\"\n\nCox has ignored \"overwhelming evidence,\" and the complaint lists a few examples. A \"Cox subscriber account having had IP address 70.168.128.98 at the time of the infringement, believed to be located in Fairfax, Virginia, was used to infringe twenty-four particular copyrighted works 1,586 times since December 9, 2013,\" they note. \"Cox subscriber having IP address 24.252.149.211 engaged in 39,432 acts of copyright infringement over 189 days.\"\n\nBMG and Round Hill, through Rightscorp, told Cox about all these infringements, but to no avail. The complaint states that Cox \"actually has taken measures to avoid and stop receiving those notifications,\" suggesting the ISP was basically treating e-mails from Rightscorp like spam.\n\nWho's a repeat infringer?\n\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed in 1998, does require ISPs to have a policy to terminate \"repeat infringers,\" but there's not a lot of clarity as to exactly what that means.\n\nDoes someone become a \"repeat infringer\" when a judge rules they have repeatedly violated copyrights? If so, the music publishers and Rightscorp have many more hoops to jump through before they have any hope of beating Cox in court. Conversely, if a judge believes Rightscorp's notifications are enough to find a user is a repeat infringer, then Cox could be in trouble.\n\nIt's a question most big rightsholders haven't been eager to resolve in court, because it's a huge gamble. A copyright-maximalist outcome could give them more enforcement tools, but if legal precedent gets set in a defense-friendly way, they could end up with far less leverage over ISPs than they have now. Since most major ISPs are compromising on the issue and slowly moving forward with a \"six strikes\" system, there've been incentives on both sides not to go to the mat on this issue.\n\nAnd Cox, which declined to comment for this story, will surely fight back hard. YouTube came under legal fire from Viacom for not doing enough to boot out copyrighted material, and Google spent $100 million defending the case -- even though the economic consequences of shutting down YouTube accounts is almost always inconsequential. Cable companies often bundle Internet with television and phone services, and a subscription can cost well over $100 per month. Since BMG and Round Hill have accused 200,000 Cox accounts of being \"repeat infringers,\" the consequences of a loss on Cox's side could be massive.\n\nBMG and Round Hill are seeking damages for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement and a judicial order requiring Cox to \"promptly forward plaintiffs' infringement notices to their subscribers.\"\n\nThe lawsuit takes place against the background of serious difficulties at Rightscorp. The company is near bankruptcy, having lost $6.5 million since its founding in 2011. Last week, a proposed class-action suit accused Rightscorp of violating federal law by using \"robocall\" equipment to demand $20-per-song settlements from Internet users.\n\nCox is far from alone in blowing off Rightscorp's notices, so it isn't clear why the Atlanta-based provider was chosen as the test case. In a recent earnings call, Rightscorp CEO Christopher Sabec said the 150 or so ISPs that work with Rightscorp cover only about 15 percent of US Internet users.", "Friday Wrap #129: High court's Facebook free speech case, Uber app isn't malware, Amazon activism 2014-11-28\n\nPosted on November 28, 2014 2:38 pm by Shel Holtz | Advertising | Brands | Business | Ethics | Facebook | Legal | Marketing | Mobile | Monitoring | Research | Social Media | Twitter\n\nFlickr photo of wrapping a turkey in bacon courtesy of Jennifer MorrowA very Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers; I hope you enjoyed warmth, family, and turkey yesterday. Here's an abbreviated Friday Wrap (since there wasn't much news published yesterday or today); I'll be back with a more complete round-up next week. In the meantime, be sure to follow my link blog to stay on top of all the items I collect, from which I select stories for the Wrap and for my weekly podcast.\n\nNews\n\nFree speech on Facebook goes to the U.S. Supreme Court -- On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that will decide when the First Amendment protects violent posts on social media. Anthony Elonis is facing a 44-month prison sentence for posting threats to his ex-wife on Facebook. While his ex felt like she was being stalked, Elonis is claiming that he's an aspiring rapper who quoted works from Jay-Z, the Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem. \"Art is about pushing limits,\" he wrote; \"I'm willing to go to jail for my constitutional rights.\" The court will determine whether the law under which Elonis was convicted requires proof of subjective intent to threaten, and whether the First Amendment requires a similar standard of proof.

Once you go through the process, YouTube will recommend some URLs \"based on your channel's description, Google identity and associated websites.\" Read more\n\nTwitter tests analytics within each tweet -- Twitter is experimenting with a feature that will display the analytics of a tweet from directly inside that tweet. If you're one of the Twitter users included in the test, you'll see a \"view analytics details\" button on the mobile app. When you tap it, you'll see total impressions, total engagements, engagement rate, and other details.

That's what happened to Anthony Noto, Twitter's chief financial officer, when he tweeted, \"I still think we should buy them. He is on y our schedule for De 15 or 16 -- we will need to sell him. i have a plan.\" The errant tweet led to a lot of speculation over the target as well as discussion about the gaffe. If there's a lesson to learn, it's that these things happen. Deal with them and move on.

The concerns that led to the post were the same that had the Internet abuzz with reports of all the horrible things Facebook's Messenger app was doing. Like Messenger, Uber has to use the default permission language written by Google (for Android) and Apple (for iOS). The permissions sound scary, writes The Next Web's Owen Williams, but their uses are legitimate. In an email to readers, Editor-in-Chief Martin Bryant pointed out, \"The real problem here is that tech companies don't describe what they're doing well enough. Super-simple terms and conditions would be better for everyone. I've noticed a growing cynicism from a segment of our readers about every new data-focused app released, both from 'big guys' like Google and Facebook to tiny new startups alike... clearer communication is one step every tech company can take to help maintain the trust of their users.\" I couldn't agree more. Read more\n\nAmazon activism is now a thing -- The Rainforest Action Network (RAN) took to Amazon's review feature to protest against PepsiCo's use of palm oil sourced from the rainforest. In the section of a product page where customers can ask questions, RAN members posted queries like, \"Is Pepsi Co. still destroying forests for palm oil? I can think of more environmentally friendly companies to get drinks from.\" The campaign was launched in an effort to force the food-and-drink company to adopt a palm oil purchasing policy. Based on the visibility the campaign achieved, we can expect others to adopt the technique.

The company removed the app and introduced a new one, which quickly amassed several five-star ratings. When Scott Stratten dug a little deeper, though, he found those reviewing the app were mostly Bell Canada staffers from either the marketing or IT departments. Non-employee reviews weren't so kind. \"Not only is this not ethical,\" Stratten writes, \"it also breaks every review site rule or TOS.\" It's not a practice to emulate.

The Times ran an article on the North Dakota oil boom. The article wasn't kind to oil companies, but it did note that Statoil has an impressive safety record. A Statoil display ad appeared alarmingly close to the paragraph referencing the company. Statoil didn't place the ad there deliberately -- it was placed there coincidentally by the automation process. The opposite is equally possible: your ad appears alongside critical or objectionable commentary.

Other results from the LinkedIn/Wakefield Research study include the fact that employees care more about small successes than major advances. Small successes lead employees to feel better about their jobs, which in turn results in them working harder.

It's not an exact replicy; it says Moto 360 instead of Rolex, but that crown logo is prominent. Watchmakers are getting wise to the fact that hobbyists are creating watchfaces designed to emulate their expensive designs, which users are installing on a variety of smartwatches. Takedown requests are starting to pour in from brands including omega, Panerai, Swatch, and Tissot. According to one report, the watchmakers aren't really worried about the digital replicas, but are obligated to take this step in order to continue taking action against more traditional counterfeits. Read more", "NEW DELHI: Microsoft India Chairman Bhaskar Pramanik has taken a pot shot at rivals Google and Facebook over their proposals to tackle the country's last-mile broadband connectivity problem, and said the technology that the software giant is offering is potentially more effective to take high-speed Internet to remote villages.\n\nIndia has become the latest battleground for the three US majors, as they aim for the telecom department's contract to provide last-mile connectivity as part of the over Rs 20,000 crore national broadband project. Google is experimenting with a network of helium balloons to relay signals to places that are hard to reach for traditional networks, while Facebook is considering using drones. Microsoft's technology, called TV White-Space, uses unused spectrum in frequencies used by TV channels to carry data.\n\n\"I can't imagine a drone hovering over the Earth for long periods of time and a balloon not drifting away, while here you can use solar power, an antenna that is used for simple TV broadcast and a device or router which is powered by solar which can provide the connectivity,\" Pramanik told ET.\n\nThe local unit of the Redmond, Washington-based company has sought a licence from the telecom department to deploy a working example of the technology in Bangalore as proof of concept.\n\nFacebook declined to comment, while Google did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nGoogle's Project Loon aims to provide \"inexpensive\" Internet access across India through a network of helium-filled solar-powered balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 32 km. Pilot projects are underway in New Zealand, California and Brazil.\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has previously played down the effectiveness of Google's balloons, saying they have a shorter life than drones and can't survive the rigour of weather patterns. \"This means drones have more endurance than balloons, while also being able to have their location precisely controlled,\" he had said in a white paper on drones earlier this year.\n\nFacebook's Connectivity Lab is developing massive, yet light, solarpowered drones which will be able to fly for years at a time and serve as large connectivity hubs, the division's engineering director Yael Maguire had said. The first of these drones may well be deployed in India, ET reported earlier this month.\n\n\"So there are many choices we have as a nation - we can use 2G, 3G or 4G, we can talk about balloons or drones. But my belief is that this is one other technology which can be used,\" Pramanik said.\n\nMicrosoft is not talking about running a network, but more about creating a technology meant for emerging markets, he said. \"We'd like government, nations and telecom companies to use it.\"\n\nThe radio interface developed by Microsoft functions like Wi-Fi router on a bigger scale. It provides wireless connectivity across a 10 km radius with speeds of up to 16 Mbps, a much larger area and speeds than the typical routers set up for commercial use today.\n\nUsing White-Fi and dynamic spectrum, there is possibility of extending the network coverage by 10 kms from each of the 250,000 touch points and then connect another router and extend it by another 10 kms, effectively blanketing the country, Pramanik added.", "Apple released the much-anticipated numbers that would finally let their customers, and the rest of the world for that matter, just how successful their latest operating system has been. At least in terms of adoption. Adoption rate is something that has always been a major sticking point for Apple since typically most of their devices are eligible for upgrading when an update goes live. Comparatively, there is a bit of a process for Android users that would like to upgrade to the latest operating system. Just ask those who are waiting for Android 5.0 Lollipop right now.\n\nIn October, the adoption rate had seemed to stall just below 50% which began to give a lot of people cause for concern. Apple likes to see their operating systems being adopted, even in older devices. At its peak - iOS 7 had actually crested three-quarter mark hitting a 78% adoption rate. In fact, even at the end of October, the adoption rate was just at just 52%.\n\nThe slow adoption process has to do with a lot of different factors. First, you have to contend with the fact that customers have been driven away by the iOS 8 horror stories that have been heard for the last several months after the initial launch of iOS 8 and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\n\nMust Read: Black Friday Smartphone Deals 2014 from ATT, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile\n\nAnother factor was that many users had to plug their devices in just to update. The update was so large, and required so much space - those with older devices, or devices that simply had a lot of data stored on them - weren't able to download the update over Wi-Fi. After that the iOS 8.0.1 update, which was said to fix all of the mistakes that iOS 8.0 had come with actually turned out to be disastrous, and raised more new issues, than it did correct any outstanding issues.\n\nMust Read: Amazon Black Friday Deals 2014: Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets, TVs and more\n\nApple users though seem to be adopting and getting more comfortable with the new operating system as the bugs have been getting worked out. While some users are still said to have issues with Wi-Fi, and a few other sporadic issues, by and large most of them have been fixed. Apple has even mocked Google to some degree regarding their adoption rates, but the truth is that the two operating systems are very difficult to compare. Apple can almost \"blanket release\" their updated operating systems, while Android updates have to be adopted by individual manufacturers before they can be adopted by users individually.", "Tokyo: As Samsung Electronics and General Electric make refrigerators that can tell you're out of milk and ovens that can be switched on with a mobile phone, Eva Chen warns such advances may also let hackers into your home.\n\nThe president of Trend Micro, the Tokyo-based developer of security software, said threats from hacking will spread as appliances, cameras and other devices connect to the Internet. She's betting that protection for the so-called Internet of things will be among the main reasons her company will more than double its number of users in three years.\n\n\"You'll feel like you're living in a glass house,\" Chen, 55, said in a recent interview in Tokyo. \"The consumer doesn't even know that their device is hooking up to the Internet and sending all this information out.\"\n\nAs Samsung, GE, Apple and Google are racing to infuse more technology into everyday devices, the potential risks are beginning to emerge. This year, the European Cybercrime Centre warned that Web-connected appliances could lead to new types of targeted attacks, theft and possibly physical injuries.\n\nHousehold hacking\n\nWhile the majority of incidents of hackings into the home have been limited to Web camera intrusions, researchers have found ways to tamper with everything from cars to toilets.\n\nThe market for the Internet of things will probably almost quadruple to $7.1 trillion by 2020, according to IDC. That's enough to lure major tech companies such as Samsung Electronics, which has released remotely-controlled lights and washing machines. Google purchased Nest Labs, a maker of connected thermostats and smoke detectors, earlier this year for $3.2 billion.\n\nMakers of household goods say they're aware of the risks and are taking steps to protect their products. Japan's Toshiba, which makes fridges with internal cameras and remotely-controlled vacuum cleaners, secures its connected appliances through a system that requires encrypted passwords, according to Yuichiro Honda, an official at the company's planning department. Panasonic encrypts all communication to and from connected home appliances, as well as passwords at multiple levels, spokeswoman Chieko Gyobu said.", "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a French geologist and paleontologist whose crucial scientific work was done before the Second World War. He was also a Jesuit priest. De Chardin believed fervently in evolution, which the Catholic Church at this point officially didn't. So there was a conflict. The trouble with The De Chardin Project, Adam Seybold's biographical play, is that the conflict is all external.\n\nThe hero isn't defrocked or excommunicated, but he's posted to China; in effect he's banished. Exile turns out to be a kind of blessing, since on an archeological dig there, he discovers a previously missing link in the evolutionary chain, to be known thereafter as \"Peking Man.\" When war comes, he's interrogated by the Japanese as to what he's done with the evidence. But fearsome as these pressures must have been, they don't mean much theatrically because the protagonist never seems in any danger of succumbing to them. He never seems to have doubts. The play maintains a high level of intellectual chat, but it's basically undramatic.\n\nIt also has a hackneyed framework. We enter the theatre to find our hero stretched out flat on the floor. It seems that he has had a heart attack, and is minutes away from death. A mysterious female figure makes a highly effective surprise entrance and proceeds, as his past life flashes before him, to impersonate the most unforgettable people the dying man ever met.\n\nThis turns out to be a good thing, as it enables Maev Beaty to play even more characters, faster, than she did last year in Passion Play. As de Chardin's Jesuit superior relaying the bad news from Rome she strays into sentimentality, playing sympathy rather than rigour, but elsewhere she is irreproachable. She is steely and scary as the Japanese jailer, funny as a jovially skeptical colleague, and gets to inject some real tension into the proceedings as an American expat who does her best to get the priest into bed. He's as committed to his spiritual vows as to his scientific quest (in fact he regards the two as one) so she has to settle for being his secretary, confidante and muse. But he does at least seem tempted, and we finally get to see him interacting with a character who's on stage long enough for there to be a relationship.\n\nAlan Dilworth's production makes imaginative, haunting use of lighting and sound, on a set by\n\nLorenzo Savoini that looks like a boxing ring riddled with trap-doors. Cyrus Lane plays de Chardin for the most part on one conscientiously worried note, but that's what he's been handed. He plays the arguments well, but they remain speeches. At the end he's vouchsafed a vision of discoveries that will vindicate him after his death. (He died in New York in 1955.)\n\nWe can work out for ourselves that his view of the Biblical creation story will become theologically mainstream: that it's metaphor rather than history or, as G.K.\n\nChesterton wittily put it, that science proves not that God doesn't exist but that he's been much underrated. Maybe more heretical is his view of Original Sin: that it's a good thing that makes human striving possible. As a non-believer, I've always found it a persuasive doctrine; it accounts for the way things always go wrong. It accounts, in fact, for tragedy. Seybold's play makes a bold attempt to give these ideas theatrical shape but it doesn't show them working on or through its hero. It's a whistlestop bio.\n\nTalking of tragedy: Ned Dickens wrote the monumental City of Wine cycle, a reimagining, and fleshing out, of the substantial portion of Greek drama that's set in Thebes. His new play Paulo and Daphne goes back to mythology, less successfully. It presents the story of Apollo and Daphne, as told in Ovid's Metamorphoses, as the tale of a Canadian immigration lawyer and his assistant; he wants her, she obdurately resists. (She's also smarter than he is, which isn't in the source.)\n\nTo them comes a refugee claimant, bearing a volume of Ovid, and calling herself Illyria, which Google tells them was another name for Thrace, which is now called Bosnia, and whose more ancient horrors included the Minotaur. This, Illyria tells them, is her story, though she keeps changing her own. Despite felicities in the writing, it all seems forced, out of scale; though it might be more persuasive in a more precisely weighted production than Adam Proszowski's (for Theatreworks Productions), in which two of the actors, Karen Glave and Daniella Forget, are overheated while the third, W. Joseph Matheson, is less consistently and slightly more effectively understated.\n\nFor an independent production that gets everything right, I have to cite Moment, an Irish play by Deirdre Kinahan, that ARC produced at The Grocery on Queen Street East. It has closed, but must be revived. It had the feel of a site-specific show without actually being one; the audience, limited to 30, sat around the walls of a kitchen re-created in mesmeric detail.\n\nWithin it unfolded a tale of family reunion; longed for by the unbalanced widowed mother of the house, dreaded by everyone else, notably by the artist-son returning years after being released from long imprisonment for a horrendous offence. Christopher Stanton, already known as an actor and sound designer, directed this one with, except at the very end, impeccable sensitivity. The exchanges around the dinner-table were superbly orchestrated; they felt like life. The actors were pretty much perfect but I have to single out Janet Porter as a resentful daughter, dragooned into attendance, sitting awaiting an inevitable explosion and, her face told us, both dreading and willing it to happen. That's two plays that invoke fate, one that made it real.\n\nThe De Chardin Project plays through Dec. 14 at Theatre Passe Muraille; Paulo and Daphne\n\nplays through Dec. 7 at the Pia Bauman Theatre.", "While most of the TV and HDTV deals you'll see this Black Friday and Cyber Monday are on LED/LCD TVs, there are still a few plasma TVs being offered. Videophiles prefer plasma technology for its deep dark blacks and rich, saturated colors. With Panasonic out of the plasma business, only LG and Samsung are left. And in terms of performance, Samsung usually offers the better plasma TVs. We found Samsung's 60-inch PN60F5300 on sale at BestBuy.com for a low $699.99 with free shipping. We predict that this will be one of the last great deals on a large high performance plasma HDTV .\n\nHere's the link:\n\nThe 60-inch F5300 (full model number PN60F5300AFXZA) is a full HD 1080p panel with a 600 Hz sub-field drive for excellent motion reproduction (great for movies and sports).

(REUTERS/Francois Lenoir)\n\nThe European Union on Thursday voted to break up Web giant Google in a bid to curb its burgeoning presence and power.\n\nAlthough it looks on the face of it like a decision dramatic enough to cause founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to choke on their Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, the vote is non-binding meaning Google will, for the time being at least, remain intact.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe idea of splitting Google into smaller companies in Europe hit the headlines last week when the EU's draft motion first came to light. The action was proposed in part as a way to tackle complaints from rivals that the Mountain View firm favors its own services in its search results. The motion called for the \"unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services\" to reduce the extent of Google's dominance.\n\nRelated: 'Please forget me,' say 12,000 Europeans on day one of new Google initiative\n\nThe Financial Times, which first revealed the EU's plan to vote on the matter, described the singling out of a U.S. company for censure as \"extremely rare,\" adding that Google executives were said to be \"furious at the political nature\" of the motion. The FT suggested German politicians in particular had \"turned against Google\" in recent months, with the EU's digital commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger apparently keen to make the company pay a fee for showing copyrighted content while also questioning the neutrality of its search results, among other things.\n\nAlthough the European parliament has no power to break up companies, Thursday's vote will nevertheless ratchet up the pressure on the European Commission, which takes care of preparing and implementing EU legislation.\n\nAttention will also turn to Margrethe Vestager, the new EU competition commissioner responsible for making a decision on whether to bring formal anti-competitive charges against Google once the commission's investigation, which started four years ago, concludes.", "\"We have enough politicians who try to be celebrities and kiss babies and cut ribbons.\"\n\nA half-dozen potential Republican presidential contenders spent last week peacocking across the sprawling grounds of a pink-hued luxury resort, schmoozing with donors and sizing up the competition in the party's most fractured field in decades.\n\nThey rarely criticized each other in public, but there were subtle jabs.\n\nWithin hours of New Jersey Gov.

Haley Barbour, who downplayed the potential risk of so many candidates at each other's throats. \"They won't all run, of course, but a lot of quality in there.\"\n\nThe candidates aren't expected to start formally declaring their intentions until the first quarter of next year. But the developing tensions were already apparent as five potential candidates appeared together on stage in a packed, grand ballroom to answering questions from moderator Chuck Todd, the host of NBC's \"Meet The Press\" -- a dress rehearsal of sorts for the looming primary.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, a former congressman, repeatedly crossed words with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, challenging Walker's telling of the history of the Bill Clinton administration. On another panel, Walker mentioned that he'd been in high school at a time when Kasich had voted on a piece of immigration legislation.\n\n\"Well, you don't look that much younger,\" Kasich quipped.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry left little doubt that the race is on.\n\n\"I think the campaign has engaged. We're talking about issues here that are going to affect the presidential election in 2016,\" Perry said. \"I think we need to have this conversation with America.\"\n\nA governor best for the job\n\nThe governors who would be president agreed on one thing: their superiority as candidates over their non-gubernatorial competition. Those in attendance repeatedly stressed that the party's best hope for reclaiming the White House lies with a chief executive at the top of the ticket.\n\nBut they dismissed the idea of any kind of advance pact to ensure they don't inflict too much damage during the primary.\n\n\"Um, no, no pacts, at least none that I'm involved in,\" said Christie, joking that he'd be closely watching Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, another potential contender, to make sure he wasn't forging any deals.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, that's exactly what the contenders were aiming for.\n\nDozens of the party's biggest donors enjoyed private audiences with prospective candidates. They mingled in hotel corridors, at fancy dinners, on a nearby golf course where basketball great Michael Jordan was spotted, and at fetes, like an oceanside reception decorated with twinkling lights, a clam cake station and ice sculptures.\n\nThe guest list included Republican heavy hitters like Paul Singer, Anthony Scaramucci and Foster Friess.\n\nChristie, who arrived with what appeared to be his entire senior team, said he was enjoying spending time with donors \"in an atmosphere that's a lot more relaxed, like this one this week.\"\n\nIndeed, one top consultant who has served as senior adviser on numerous campaigns was spotted walking through the lobby in his bathing suit on the way to the pool between meetings. And at all times, lobbyists from companies like Google hovered, slipping business cards to governors and aides, who left one speed dating-style session with pockets bursting.\n\nStill, the presidential undertones were more subtle at times than in annual retreats of years past when prospective candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani held private meetings to craft campaign strategy with key supporters.", "Before Spark NZ chief executive Simon Moutter was officially named to the top job at what was then Telecom, he saw a business in dire straits that needed to make a fundamental shift to survive. Moutter went into the final interviews for the top job with a transformative plan and a timeline for getting it done.\n\nThe Herald talked to Moutter about how he's navigating Spark through a period of unprecedented disruption in the telecommunications industry and the company's transformation to a digital services company.\n\nWhen you first took over as Chief Executive at Telecom, what state did you find the business in?\n\nMobile growth and market growth was very strong, so the company was prospering off the back of that. At the same time though, the rise of the competitive position of OEM's (original equipment manufacturers or device makers), the over the top operators - Google, Facebook and the like - combined with the regulatory impulse really started to hit the company from 2004 onwards..\n\nThe industry structure was also changing. We saw the combination of our two biggest competitors - Vodafone and Telstra Clear, plus the arrival of 2 Degrees as a third entrant into the mobile market - and that altered the competitive landscape.\n\nGrimly put, we were on a ten-year losing streak from 2004 to 2014 and we're still trying to pull ourselves out of that. It's a challenge anyway you look at it and I often use a sporting analogy - if you get a team on a losing streak, the first job before you can even begin to think about winning the league, is to get back into the habit of winning.\n\nWhat steps did you take to try and re-establish the habit of winning within the business?\n\nWe had tried small changes, but when you have massive inertia, you have to apply a lot for to it to change its direction. The conclusion we came to was that we have to stop dabbling and make several very significant and far-reaching moves - taking on quite a bit of risk in the process. That's what led to the idea to move from a fixed mobile infrastructure company to a digital services company.\n\nThat led to a series of decisions around what exactly is a digital services retailer, what are the dynamics of the business and how do we deliver it. From there, we undertook a series of moves from office simplifications through to a change in brand to adopt a name that would work with an unknown set of digital services in the future as opposed to our telco past.\n\nWhy do you think it was necessary to rebrand from what was an iconic New Zealand brand in Telecom to something completely unknown like Spark?\n\nThe rebrand was the most visible sign to our customers that we were making a new stand to be a different business from what Telecom was and I signalled that as part of my plan when I was interviewing for the role. The name Telecom means telephone to most people - particularly younger people - and telephones are increasingly becoming a less significant element of our business.\n\nWe needed a name that can roll with the future of digital services - Cloud applications, television, media, data services. While you might have an opinion on whether Spark was the best one we could have chosen, what we did need to do was move on from Telecom because that name represented our past and not our future.\n\nIs there a precedent for such a large telecommunications company to successfully make such a fundamental shift?\n\nProbably the best example not too far away is Telstra. They achieved a big change from what I understand, mostly off the back of Vodafone's really complete collapse in Australia. They had enormous network problems a few years ago which drove most of their customer base away, so Telstra invested extremely heavily in mobile capability and established massive market leadership on that front.\n\nYou've been in the job over two years now, how has the transition gone compared with the blueprint you set out before you even took the job?\n\nIt's been tough, but we've accomplished it sooner than I expected. We're either on or ahead of the plan I set out. The one piece that have proved to be more difficult to move has been Spark Digital - what was previously Gen-I. I underestimated the degree of the challenge there and that's been driven by the revolution of cloud computing - which I knew of, but I didn't really understand.\n\nCloud computing really took off when I was working at Auckland Airport and I had been a part of Gen-I prior to that, I understood the business well and the position we had it in. But the big correction occurring, which is a fundamental change in the way a business buys IT services in the next 20 years or so, meant we had to make a bigger adjustment there.\n\n* It has motivated us to do a complete strategic reset of the business, and completely re-architect where we allocate resources and investment and what types of business we are in.\n\n* It's driven our decision to invest in more 700MHz spectrum than anyone else, because we understand the importance of 4G mobile to NZ's future. It's driven our decision to set up Spark Ventures to focus on growth opportunities and build a portfolio of new businesses.\n\n* It's led to the decision to change our brand from Telecom to Spark, to better represent our future not our past. It's reoriented our business to put customers, rather than the copper wire, at the heart of what we do.\n\n* It's motivated our ambition to help customers unleash their potential, and help them do great things for NZ.\n\n* It has motivated us to do a strategic reset of the business, and completely re-architect where we allocate resources and investment and what types of business we are in.\n\n* It's driven massive change in terms of getting more cost-competitiveness, refocusing on the NZ market and exiting Australia, and investing in things like Cloud and data centres.", "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- When it comes to mobile shopping, Apple users won the Thanksgiving Day spending battle.\n\nApple iOS mobile users spent about 25% more than Android owners on their Turkey Day purchases, with an average of $118.57 per order compared to $95.25, according to the most recent data from IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark.\n\nSales slowed down (blame the tryptophan) as the day continued, as earlier reports showed the average order value of Apple iOS users came in at $122.08 and $97.25 for Android users.\n\n\"Apple has a strong hold on online shopping,\" said Jay Henderson, director of IBM Smarter Commerce. \"IPhone and iPad buyers tend to be slightly more affluent and more comfortable with technology.\"\n\nApple users are three times more likely to make a purchase on their mobile or tablet device, and made up 25% of total online sales on Thursday. This is despite the fact that Google's operating system is the top smartphone platform in the U.S. market.\n\nAs more retailers launched their Black Friday sales a day early, shoppers realized they didn't have to leave their house -- or be in front of a computer -- to score a deal. Half of all online shopping on Thursday -- including browsing -- was done on a mobile device.\n\n\"That's pretty dramatic,\" said Henderson, especially since in 2010 that number was just 6.5%. Of actual sales, mobile accounted for 32% of all online purchases Thursday, up from 25.4% last year.\n\nHowever, the desktop PC is still in the deal-seeker's arsenal.

But in the war over standardized testing and other curricular concerns, the country has largely abdicated its responsibilities to teach children even the basics of technological literacy.\n\nEnter Chicago public schools.\n\nAmerica's third-largest school district typically finds itself in the national media for stories about violence, school closures and other unflattering subjects. It has received less attention for an ambitious and innovative experiment launched this year: democratizing the teaching of computer science to children, a subject usually relegated to upper-income, male, white autodidacts.\n\nNew computer science classes rolled out across Chicago's K-12 system this fall, and within a few years the city plans to make its school district the first major one in the country to designate computer science as a requirement for graduation. Other big districts -- including New York and Los Angeles -- are watching carefully to see whether the model can be replicated.\n\nThe biggest obstacle is that so few teachers are able to teach the coursework. Americans with even basic training in programming and computer science have employment options far more lucrative than teaching, and union contracts generally prohibit districts from paying teachers more for highly coveted specialized skills.\n\nTo scale up quickly, Chicago partnered with Code.org, a nonprofit funded by tech companies such as Google and Facebook.\n\nCode.org trains teachers in dozens of school districts around the country, paying all associated costs, including teacher stipends. Cameron Wilson, the organization's chief operating officer, estimates that such costs run about $10,000 per high school teacher, less for elementary and middle school teachers. Over the summer, Code.org paid to train 202 Chicago teachers in the 46 schools participating in the first phase of the district's Computer Science for All initiative.\n\nChicago's biggest success story so far appears to be Ariel Community Academy, a school on the South Side where 98 percent of the kids are black and almost all qualify for subsidized lunches. At Ariel, computer science lessons begin in kindergarten, where the kids already refer to themselves as \"professional coders.\"\n\nWhen I visited last week, 5- and 6-year-olds were eagerly learning about \"algorithms\" by coming up with directions to guide \"Angry Birds\" characters through a maze in search of evil pigs. If that sounds like a silly video game, perhaps it is, but it's also training in the step-by-step process that characterizes computational thinking.\n\nIn a fourth-grade classroom, children played a similar version of the game, this time using repeated \"loops\" to complete the maze more quickly. They also practiced \"unplugged\" versions of the lessons, illustrating \"loops\" by teaching each other repeated dance moves and making paper airplanes.\n\nIn an eighth-grade classroom, coding was integrated into a math lesson, in which students wrote a simple program that solved arithmetic problems. That same lesson plan also taught them to write code that draws colorful stars, circles and other shapes. By the end of the year, the students will be designing their own video games.\n\nUnlike many \"computer\" courses around the country, the goal here is to help kids become creators -- not just consumers -- of technology. Sure, they won't all end up as prize-winning software engineers (although stories of lavish free meals at Google did pique the interest of one salivating eighth-grade class). But having basic computational literacy can improve their job prospects in everything from health care to manufacturing to finance.\n\nIndeed, one of the three girls who escorted me around Ariel, 10-year-old Cheyenne Bolin, says she loves building robots but dreams of applying her tech skills to become a fashion designer. Thirteen-year-old Gabrielle Perry, a school star who learned Java and Python through a summer program, fancies working in psychology.\n\nDecades ago, educators and policymakers mobilized around the space race, revamping curricula to try to equip not just our best and brightest and richest but all the rest, too, to compete with the world in math and science. So far there has been little such movement on the computer science front, even as employers emphasize the importance of having these skills and policymakers recognize how inequitably they are distributed throughout the populace.\n\nMaybe Chicago's approach will work, and maybe it won't. But until more districts get the courage, flexibility and, most important, resources to find ways to inject computer science into classrooms, our country will be systematically failing the next generation of students and workers.", "Unlike recipes off the Internet, an old-fashioned collection of recipes from friends and family offers a trove of unique memories.\n\nTHE INTERNET has given us the ability to access millions of recipes and share them instantaneously. We post favorite dishes on Facebook, create food blogs, Google obscure and exotic ingredients. Without a doubt, propping my iPad on the kitchen island is a convenient and paperless way to cook.\n\nBut for recipes that are personal and have history, I open my old recipe-card collection. The plastic file box itself is nothing special. Colored index cards are taped with recipes cut out of magazines and newspapers or, more recently, printed from the Internet. The real treasures are those that were written by hand.\n\nIt is a collection not only of recipes but of memories, of people and of places. Snapshots.\n\nIn my own awkward third-grade cursive, a favorite recipe for German Pancakes. Also from childhood: Yogurt-Berry Mousse and Orange Julius. As my handwriting changed over the years, so, too, did my eating habits. Recent additions tend toward the ethnic and vegetarian, dairy- and gluten-free. The evidence is undeniable: at one point, I really did make potato-cheese soup.\n\nMrs. Kann's Apple Turnovers, from my home economics teacher in Portland.\n\nUnmistakable, my mom's handwriting, for Vichyssoise. And a relic from her old Olympia typewriter, Sole with Mornay Sauce. Both of these from a time when she cooked with heavy cream.\n\nSmothered Pheasant, written in lovely script by my aunt Carol. It was my grandmother's recipe, and I made it only once, on my dad's birthday.\n\nDuring my first trip to France, the homestay \"mother\" (who didn't have any children of her own, but that's beside the point) took me to her mother's house in the hills of Provence one day. Her mother had prepared a fantastic Dijon rabbit for lunch and floating islands for dessert. I'd never seen white meringue swimming in cr\u00e8me anglaise, and it blew my mind. Even though I've lost touch with the host family, the directions for Les Iles Flottantes remain, in blue ink and nearly illegible French handwriting.\n\nHandwriting from a college boyfriend who took it upon himself to copy several recipes for me. A few years later, he died in an accident in Alaska. Yet he is still there, his black ink on the cards for Curry Pasta and Quiche.\n\nA recipe circa 1990, from a secretary in my office at the time, for Black Bread, which calls for bran cereal, molasses, coffee powder and candied orange peel. She wrote at the top: \"particularly tasty when unemployed.\"\n\nSome handwriting I no longer recognize, just as the identities elude us of some people in old photographs. Their writing is in my box, these mysteries from my past with whom I shared food and ideas. Who gave me Orange Bran Muffins? Creamed Onions? If only I had written names and dates on all the recipes I've received.\n\nMost of the contributors have died; some simply have drifted off to their own lives. But somehow, seeing their writing and remembering their food, they are still with me. I'm reminded of a quote from the writer and artist Brian Andreas: \". . . It may be the real reason we are here: to love each other, to eat each other's cooking and say it was good.\"\n\nI'm thankful that my old-fashioned recipe box captures these connections to family, friends and to my past self. And I wonder what we as a society might be losing if we share recipes only in email. While today's digital world allows us to preserve documents and photographs indefinitely, there's no substitute for a loved one's original handwriting on an old faded recipe card.", "Megaupload founder a \"flight risk\" before 2015 extradition hearing, NZ says.\n\nProsecutors told a New Zealand courtroom on Friday that Kim Dotcom is a flight risk, alleging that he violated the terms of his bail that allowed him to live under house arrest rather than jail. That came just days after the Megaupload founder told a London tech conference that he was \"officially broke\" after transferring his remaining assets to his wife and children.\n\nAccording to TVNZ, New Zealand authorities claimed that the Megaupload founder \"has breached bail conditions by having indirect contact with one of his accused; that he is a flight risk because he has the money to skip the country; and that he has been dishonest about his finances by trying to sell a NZ$500,000 Rolls Royce in London.\"\n\nRon Mansfield, Dotcom's new local lawyer, denied that Dotcom was a flight risk: \"He's still here.\"\n\nThe New Zealand bail hearing will continue on Monday, when the judge is expected to make a ruling.\n\n\"Suffice it to say that we think that the government bail allegations are without merit, and we are disappointed that the allegations were raised only minutes after the [formal] departure of Kim Dotcom's New Zealand counsel -- such an approach gives the appearance of procedural gamesmanship,\" Ira Rothken, Dotcom's California-based attorney, told Ars via text message on Friday.\n\nThis month, the case against Dotcom and his co-defendants heated up as United States federal prosecutors asked a court to transfer ownership of his seized assets (which remain in New Zealand government custody) to the United States government on \"doctrine of fugitive disentitlement.\" If the court agrees, and Dotcom and the others are declared fugitives, then they can have no claim on the assets that have already been seized.\n\nAmerican authorities want the US federal court in Virginia to move quickly:\n\nIn addition, a delay in this case could jeopardize forfeiture of the assets if foreign governments proceed to release the currently restrained assets despite the United States' requests to continue restraint. For assets located in New Zealand, at least, the restraint sought based upon the order of this Court cannot, by statute, be extended beyond April 18, 2015. The initial hearing for the New Zealand defendants' extradition eligibility is now scheduled for June 2, 2015, which is long after those restraints will have been lifted.\n\nDays earlier, Dotcom lost his previous New Zealand-based legal team. In early November 2014, Rothken posted on a new website, Megascholar, that he now seeks attorneys \"interested in joining the Megaupload and Kim Dotcom legal defense.\"\n\n\"Prior NZ counsel stepped down, and we have new counsel in place to handle discrete matters such as the bail hearing,\" Rothken added. \"I am continuing on as lead global counsel. We still have about 20 lawyers working on related cases globally. Funds are frozen globally and there are procedures that will be pursued to unfreeze such funds for the legal defense.\"\n\nFrom multiple jet ski owner to pauper\n\nUS authorities attempted to seize Dotcom's assets under civil forfeiture back in July 2014 -- Dotcom's lawyers attempted to have that case (which is separate from the criminal case that kicked off in January 2012) stayed until the criminal case is resolved. The judge in the civil forfeiture case has yet to rule on the motion to stay the case. Rothken argues that because Dotcom has never been to the US, he can't possibly be a fugitive.\n\nThe extensive list of seized assets includes millions of dollars in various seized bank accounts in Hong Kong and New Zealand, multiple cars, four jet skis, the Coatesville mansion, several cars, two 180-inch TVs, three 82-inch TVs, a $10,000 watch, and a photograph by Olaf Mueller worth over $100,000.\n\nSince being placed under house arrest, Dotcom has attempted to reboot his entrepreneurial career by founding Mega, another cloud storage site, along with Baboom, a music service. (Dotcom cut ties with Baboom in October 2014.) But possibly as a way to avoid further future earnings from being seized, Dotcom distributed all of his assets to his family.\n\nEarlier this week, Dotcom told a London Internet conference via video chat that he was penniless after having all of his assets seized or transferred out of his name.\n\n\"As of today, I don't have a single share in Mega,\" he said Tuesday, referring to the cloud storage company he founded in the wake of the shuttered MegaUpload.\n\n\"The family trust that controls the shares of Mega is now completely in the control of my wife and my five children who are all the beneficiaries. I had to do that, and I was happy to do that, because Hollywood has tried to attack the new assets that were generated after the raid. As you know the US government has seized everything that was created up until the raid. All moneys, all valuables were seized in all different jurisdictions, and after I started the Internet Party and invested in a political movement, the [Motion Picture Association of America] started suing me civilly to have those assets restrained as well. So I'm officially broke right now.\"\n\nFor his part, Rothken blames Dotcom's poverty (at least on paper) on the American government.\n\n\"Kim Dotcom is broke because the largest copyright case in US history has cost about $10 million to date to defend and will cost tens of millions of dollars more going forward,\" he continued via text message.\n\n\"This will also likely be one of the largest eDiscovery cases in history where current estimates put out of pocket vendor costs alone over $5 million. Given that all of Kim's funds are frozen globally the government is trying to win this case as war of attrition on procedure rather than merit. If Google wasn't permitted to fund the YouTube defense to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in a copyright civil case then YouTube would have lost. The Megaupload case, given the criminal forum and civil forums, will be more expensive to fully defend than YouTube.\"", "I turn 30 years old tomorrow, so naturally I Googled 'turning 30 significance' to see how I should take it.\n\nThe first thing to pop up was Wikipedia's entry for 'Existential Crisis'. Other options included: a gift guide to \"help people take their minds off what comes along with that age\", the blog of some lady who'd slunk off to India at 30 to find herself, and a self-help book and article called, respectively, Making Choices, Finding Meaning, and Turning 30, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Start Loving.\n\nIt all seemed a bit glum.

Let's not do that either.", "What strikes us as odd is that almost a year and a half later, Pakistan still does not have a foreign minister. The foreign advisor, Mr Aziz, is playing that role, at least on the surface\n\nIt is often said that a picture speaks louder than a thousand words. If you have seen the visuals of the prime ministers of both India and Pakistan at the recent South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) conference, you will know exactly what this saying truly means. Based on media reports, both premiers shared the same stage but completely ignored one another. When Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif headed towards the podium for his speech, the PM of India was found reading a magazine. Conversely, when PM Modi addressed the SAARC conference, our PM was seen in deep distress, holding his forehead like he was trying to fight a grueling migraine. These are grown, middle-aged men, who were found acting like two juveniles in what we commonly remember in our childhood slang as kutti (not talking) mode.\n\nIt is pointless to regurgitate the usual blame game of who did what first and the unnecessary exercise of finger pointing. If both these gentlemen were going to act like two brooding juveniles, it would have been wise to stay home and save each other from such embarrassment. Had it been a high school reunion, it would have made no difference. The entire world noticed such childish behaviour in a conference that basically stands for two very significant words: regional cooperation. Just imagine: the two most significant members out of a total of eight are at loggerheads with each other. What cooperation is the region dreaming of?\n\nThe media at both ends is trying to sell vitriolic narrative as usual. This is very challenging for optimists like me. When I see the barbs fly from both ends, it simply infuriates me. Yes, Modi may be right that these neighbours are geographically closer but these neighbours have to cooperate as well. Knowing full well that most Indian readers will express their views toeing the line of their media, I would still say that the ball is in India's court. If Modi wants the SAARC countries to cooperate, actions must follow words. It is also safe to say that both countries take centre-stage at any such moot. The world's press is not so concerned with Nepal, Bhutan or the Maldives, but how these two rather irate neighbours act at any such summit.\n\nRumours are rife that PM Sharif had to retreat from his friendly stance towards India, and the reasons and actors behind such a 180-degree turn are pretty well known. It is very unfortunate that 'sari diplomacy' was in vain. The hawkish Mr Modi pulled the plug. I remember playing the snakes and ladders game as a child. It is almost like that game: right at the 95th or 96th square, it seems like a giant python bit everyone and everyone is back at the seventh square.\n\nAnalysts believe that from a Pakistani perspective, Mr Sharif was taking steps for a very contentious foreign policy into his domain and advancing his ties with India at a rapid pace. The drivers of that domain felt that Mr Sharif was going to give a lot away to the archrival in that quest. Similarly, for Modi, in the wake of elections in the Kashmir Valley, playing goodie goodie with Pakistan was going to be counterproductive. There are possibilities that his party may win and try to repeal the special status of the Valley.\n\nWhat strikes us as odd is that almost a year and a half later, Pakistan still does not have a foreign minister. The foreign advisor, Mr Aziz, is playing that role, at least on the surface. Behind the scenes, perhaps the establishment is acting as the real policy maker. The stated line of the Pakistani side that the Kashmir issue has to be settled first before any real composite dialogue can progress, is a textbook line from a very old and perhaps useless book. To those Indian readers who are perhaps unaware of my views on the Valley, they ought to Google \"Kashmir simplified\" (Daily Times, February 14, 2013). Most Indian readers would be surprised to know that my opinion resonates with the views of an Indian veteran journalist and diplomat, Mr Kuldip Nayyar.\n\nIf both countries think that they will be able to achieve something on their stated positions, then both of these countries are seriously mistaken. The resolution of this dispute lies somewhere in the middle. That middle will bring an immediate cessation in hostilities, greater trade, economic cooperation and a boost to the travel industry. What most bright minds on both ends fail to understand is that their stated positions hinder not only their progress, but also the progress of the remaining SAARC nations. Both countries owe it to their future generations that those hostilities, the proxy wars and the tit-for-tat actions must come to an immediate end. A South Asia free of such fear, such enmity and such despair is acceptable to any sane person from these two countries and, for that matter, the rest of the world. The unconditional dialogue process must begin immediately because words are the gateway to a better understanding.\n\nThe writer is a Pakistani-American mortgage banker.

It started with the release of Google Chrome and its minimalistic design and is still ongoing.\n\nMozilla for example modified the interface of the Firefox browser this year removing interface elements such as the browser's add-on bar in the process.\n\nRussian search giant Yandex launched a web browser based on Chromium in October 2012 using a slightly modified interface.\n\nAn alpha version of the upcoming Yandex browser has been released by the company today.\n\nNote: alpha means that the browser should not be run in a productive environment. It may have bugs, lack features and cause other issues on the system. Also: the browser imported data from Firefox automatically and unless I overlooked it, without option to prevent this from happening.\n\nWhat's interesting about the release is that Yandex has removed nearly all interface elements. You don't see an address bar on launch for example and tabs are also not visible.\n\nThe browser displays a search form on launch and a list of speed dial tiles. Window controls and the main menu icon are at the top right and an x indicates the tab bar at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou can sort the tiles using drag & drop operations and switch the background animation as well. There is unfortunately no option to disable it completely but you can turn the animation off.\n\nThe search bar on the page appears to function as an address bar as well. You can type or paste an address to load it right away. Suggestions are displayed while you type which work similar to how suggestions work in other browsers and search engines.\n\nWhen you run a search or load an address directly a tab is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Tabs are colored automatically based on one of the dominant colors of the page that is loaded in them.\n\nMultiple pages of the same website are displayed in the same color and grouped together. Grouping means that they are always opened next to each other and that they are automatically joined when you switch to another tab group.\n\nThe effect is that all the pages of that site are displayed as a single tab in the browser interface. When you select them they are displayed individually again.\n\nA feature that the Yandex browser introduces is the ability to switch between the current page and the start page with the click of the mouse. A left-click on the page title flips between both pages. If you are on a supported search site, e.g. on Google, you may also notice that the same search term that you have entered on that site is also entered on the startpage.\n\nThe settings reveal additional features of interest. The browser supports a turbo mode that compresses data when enabled including video.\n\nThe browser ships with several extensions including Evernote Web Clipper, Last Pass, Web of Trust and Pocket.This and the background animations explain the size of more than 90 Megabyte of the installer.\n\nOther features include options to translate web pages automatically, to use mouse gestures supported by the browser or enable synchronization.\n\nYandex introduces several interesting features in the browser. Automatic tab grouping for example or the ability to switch between the startpage and the current page.\n\nIt seems pretty fast and responsive as well.\n\nIt is on the other hand different than the majority of browsers that you come across which many users won't like for one reason or the other.\n\nExperienced users may dislike the lack of control it offers. There does not seem to be a way to display the current url for example.", "The OnePlus One will go up for sale in India next week, but when it does, the company says that won't run CyanogenMod like the OnePlus Ones in the rest of the world do.\n\nOnePlus today penned a blog post in response to the news that Cyanogen Inc. has signed a deal with Micromax to make Micromax Yu smartphones the only devices in India to run CyanogenMod. OnePlus says that its disappointed by Cyanogen's deal, but it has a backup plan.\n\nOnePlus explains that over the past year, it's been building an internal Android team that's been putting together special OnePlus software for use in future hardware. Now that software will hit the OnePlus One as well. The software will be based on Android 5.0, will be free of bloatware and will stick to Google's Material design language. However, OnePlus does say that it plans to include futures that it thinks are important to users.\n\nThe first community build of this custom version of Android 5.0 will be made available to Indian users in December. OnePlus expects to have a production-ready build completed in February. When that happens, OnePlus expects to offer online instructions for users that want to flash it at home. Finally, OnePlus says that it will support the OnePlus One for two years, beginning with the rollout of the first community build of its software.\n\nExactly what OnePlus's custom version of Lollipop will look like remains to be seen. The company's promise of keeping its customizations light is good to hear, though, and it suggests that OnePlus could follow Motorola's footsteps when it comes to Android OS customization.", "Throngs of people still camp out awaiting Black Friday doorbuster sales, but it is more for the sake of tradition and sport than for good deals. Those can just as easily be found online.\n\nE-commerce accounts for only 6 percent of total retail spending. But sales made on computers are growing much faster than sales in offline stores -- and sales on mobile phones are growing faster still.\n\nOffline sales this holiday season have been forecast to grow about 4 percent from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Desktop e-commerce sales will grow 13 percent and mobile sales 33 percent, predicted comScore.\n\nAlready, many people use phones to research items, including while shopping in stores, even if they don't make the final purchase on a phone. There has been a spike in mobile shopping on Black Friday, as people in stores find better deals on their phones.\n\nFor consumers, mobile commerce, like other mobile technology, is all about the push toward convenience. It's easier to get in a little shopping while you wait for the cranberries to boil or hide the fact that you are shopping during Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n\"Convenience is what sells here,\" said Norman Sadeh, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and director of its mobile commerce lab. \"These cellphones are with us all the time, so why should you be doing Christmas shopping only at home? Why shouldn't you do it while you're on the subway, waiting for the bus, at the cafe?\"\n\nFor retailers, mobile commerce is the latest example of how consumers' shift to mobile is catching businesses off guard. Retailers risk making the same mistake that other companies have -- failing to keep up with consumers in making mobile shopping as easy as it is on a computer.\n\nTo avoid that, more retailers are building mobile sites and apps. Apple Pay makes easier the biggest hurdle for many mobile shoppers -- entering payment information on a tiny screen. And companies like Google are creating ways for retailers to track whether mobile shopping resulted in an offline sale.\n\nIn recent years, Thanksgiving Day has rivaled Black Friday in retail sales, largely because of the surge in e-commerce. Last year, 21 percent of e-commerce sales on Black Friday were on phones, compared with 17 percent on Cyber Monday, when people were back at their desktop computers, comScore said. That implies that people are shopping on phones at times that they previously might not have shopped at all.\n\nThe ability to shop anytime and anywhere might end up being a bigger threat to offline retailers than e-commerce has been. Just wait until we can also shop from a variety of other connected devices -- like making an impulse buy from the bedroom mirror or asking the fridge to restock itself.", "What's New - Bug fixes\n\nIf you like Launch Center Pro, please take a moment to leave a review, it really helps!

The process, which uses pressurized liquid to extract oil from shale deposits, has made the U.S. the world's top oil producer and helped bring down the cost of crude oil as well as gasoline costs for consumers.\n\nOPEC, a group of leading oil-exporting countries, contemplated cutting its production in hopes of artificially boosting prices, but decided against that move in hopes that the lower prices would hurt American companies trying to find profits with a cheaper product more than their own members.\n\n\"The message from OPEC was fairly clear -- we are not hurting yet because we are the lowest cost producers,\" Iain Armstrong, oil and gas analyst at Brewin Dolphin, told Reuters. \"It is a question of who blinks first -- OPEC or the U.S. shale producers. The longer the oil price stays at these levels the greater chance a U.S. shale producer will go under. But it will take time.\"\n\nThe message from U.S. markets when they reopened from Thursday's Thanksgiving break was even clearer: U.S. crude dropped more than 10 percent in a single day for the first time since 2009, leaving West Texas Intermediate at a price of $66.15 a barrel, the lowest price in more than four years.\n\nAnd experts say Friday may not have created a floor for oil prices.\n\n\"I don't see anything bullish out there right now that could take it higher,\" QERI Chief Investment Officer Todd Gross told The Wall Street Journal. \"There's still more potential for downside risk.\"\n\nLarge oil producers also took a hit in a shortened holiday trading session on Wall Street: San Ramon-based Chevron dove 5.4 percent to $108.87, and Exxon Mobile fell 4.2 percent to $90.54.\n\nSV150 market report: Investors look to score with Black Friday buys\n\nWhile oil companies struggled on Wall Street, tech and other stocks may have benefited, as investors bet on Americans using the savings they're realizing at gas pumps on other goods and services.\n\nAs Thanksgiving and Black Friday shoppers searched out bargains, Wall Street bid higher the price on retailers and others looking to sell holiday gear. \"Retail sales and Internet retail sales show (Thursday) was a good day,\" Dan Heckman, national investment consultant at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, told Bloomberg. \"With the drop in oil, we think this will be a tremendous holiday season.\" Wal-Mart led the Dow Jones industrial average with a 3 percent gain to $87.54, Amazon added 1.5 percent to $338.64 and San Jose-based eBay increased 0.6 percent to $54.88.\n\nGoogle gained 0.3 percent to $549.08 after the European Parliament passed legislation Thursday aimed at pressuring regulators to break up the Mountain View search giant, an effort that may not end with Google. Twitter gained 1.5 percent to $41.74 after cofounder Evan Williams sold shares for the first time since the San Francisco company's 2013 initial public offering.

Online sales were up 2.6% over 2012. Before you start your online shopping, go through this must-know Cyber Monday list from Ways To Save reporter Matt Granite:\n\n1. Cyber Monday will be better than Black Friday this year for the first time ever. I've been hunting deals for more than decade and while we saw the start of this trend last year, Cyber Monday will bring steeper discounts to the table this year.\n\n2. More people will shop Cyber Monday which means bigger deals. Based on my deal lists last year, I saw a 105% increase on Cyber Monday over Black Friday. Last year 92 million people shopped on Black Friday while 131 million people shopped Cyber Monday. That trend is expected to continue this year.\n\n3. Cyber Monday is not just for tech. Last year stronger, better, storewide clothing sales appeared on Cyber Monday, for one of the first times beating out the Black Friday offerings. Stores that were offering 40% off sitewide Black Friday had 50% off Cyber Monday. Many other shopping categories will see similar discounts.\n\n4. You need a strategy to save money on Cyber Monday. Aimless browsing and Google do not get you the most deals. If you want access to the most deals in the country before anyone else, you need a strategy and for that, check out the next point.\n\n5. Sign up here to get the deals first. I'm working with a team of deal bloggers and giant team of coupon hunters around the country. As soon as humanly possible, before Cyber Monday, you'll get access to every big Cyber Monday deal first.\n\n6. Cyber Monday does not have the same Black Friday stock issues. Since stores are not tied to ad-scans, they can shift merchandise and offer great reductions throughout the day.\n\n7. Appliances, gaming bundles and television deals are all better on Black Friday.While we will see deals from all of these categories, Black Friday instore or online is your better way to go.\n\n8. Cyber Monday brings savings that are 10% to 14% better than Black Friday.That's based on my findings from last year and the trends we expect this year. Obviously there will be exceptions, but this is my prediction for many major categories.\n\n9. Shoppers will spend more on Cyber Monday and it's something retailers notice. Last year the average shopper spent around $310 Black Friday and around $470 Cyber Monday according to an AOL survey.\n\n10. We see three important sale spikes on Cyber Monday. 12:01 a.m. EST when a good chunk of the deals are live. The next spike is 12:01 a.m. PST when certain West Coast retailers join the mix and the next spike is just before those office lunch breaks local time - usually between 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. when most shoppers are making the most of Cyber Monday from their desks. Additional incentives sometimes appear during these three spike periods.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1rCfKua", "Annoying Android Lollipop problems that are bugging Google's latest OS\n\nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop may still be crawling its way to more and more devices, but just like any other operating system, it is not perfect. We've scoured the Android Central forum threads and looked for some of the most common Android Lollipop problems that users complaint about; issues that we also think Google must address right away. We coupled those with some that PC World has mentioned in a post and compiled them in a list. Read them below and find out if you've also encountered any of them.\n\nThis is probably the most common complaint we've seen. Some nexus users, especially those who own the Nexus 5, report that their device's connection to Wi-Fi networks frequently drop. A Wi-Fi-related battery-draining bug was also the reason why the Android Lollipop roll out to older Nexus devices was delayed earlier this month.\n\nNevertheless, users have tried to either \"forget\" the network and reconnect to it later or reboot their device in order to get around this issue. Those are just temporary workarounds and the issues is very likely to occur again so sincerely hope Google will address this in the next firmware update.\n\nThis Android Lollipop bug do not seem to be restricted to a specific app but Youtube is heavily affected since it's one of the most popular video streaming apps around. This playback issue has been reported more frequent by Nexus 7 (2013 edition) users; they claim that the system is unable to load the right video player program when attempting to watch Youtube clips.\n\nThis one was pointed out by folks from PC World. Quick Settings is an Android Lollipop feature that places your most recent or frequently used configurations on its \"Quick Settings\" list which you can access by swiping down from the top of the screen. The problem is that you won't be able to edit (remove or rearrange) those quick settings toggles once they are placed there. So until Google issued an update allowing users to edit them, be careful not to tinker with settings that you probably won't use often.\n\nThis is an issue that we think Google must patch really soon. Users are reporting that apps that they left running in the background are being close unnecessarily. It's especially annoying since the apps that are closed display notifications repeatedly.\n\nUpon browsing through dozens of Android Lollipop forum threads, it appears that more users are suffering from battery-related issues. This is a problem that almost certainly arise every time a new firmware version is rolled out. It's hard to rule out the specific reason why a device's battery is draining quicker than usual as they may be caused by a lot of factors. But if the culprit is the Android OS itself or faulty apps, doing a Factory Reset may help you get around it.", "Earlier this week, TechCrunch published commentary on a report concerning the current popularity of various enterprise cloud file sync and share products, a group of services usually shortened to the acronym 'EFSS.'\n\nDropbox was far and away the leader, finding a home within nearly 45 percent of responding enterprise IT pros' businesses. Microsoft's OneDrive had over 25 percent penetration, Google's Drive had nearly 25 percent itself, and Box had just under 15 percent.\n\nSmaller players -- Amazon, Hightail, SAP Docs, Egnyte, and so forth -- each had less than 10 percent apiece.\n\nGiven the current market narrative, you must have heard that Box commands high market share among enterprise clients, and that Dropbox itself is working to close a feature gap with its competitor. The same narrative also generally maintains that Google and Microsoft are themselves straining to pick up market share, having trailed their smaller rivals into the market.\n\nSo what the hell is going on. Well, if you retreat to our previous accounting of the top four players in the market, you'll note that their market share adds to more than 100 percent. And when you stack in the other listed players, we end up far higher than a numerical peak called lleno.\n\nThe following paragraph from TechCrunch's initial coverage is elucidatory:\n\nWhat's more, just 18 percent of those surveyed currently pay for an enterprise sync and share product. It's hard to know what this all means exactly, except that as the report indicated, we are still (surprisingly) in the very early days for this market and there is a lot of room for all the players to grow.\n\nBingo: The study queried, again quoting our coverage, \"1000 IT pros in October and asked them about the sync and share tools in use in their companies.\" In use, not rolled out in a paid way.\n\nYou can't have only 18 percent of respondents paying for EFSS, more than 100 percent usage inside of companies, and have all those seats paid for. My friend Peter Kazanjy made this point to me on Twitter quite recently:\n\nSo what we can divine from the data is actually less than you would expect. Yes, Dropbox is popular. And of course Google and Microsoft have large unpaid market share since they have huge consumer buy in, and so forth.\n\nOnly 4 percent of respondents plan to roll out paid EFSS services to their company inside the next 6 months. That's a mere 22.22 percent of the current paying base. Or, put more simply, growth in the enterprise file storage space might be slower than we might have anticipated.\n\nThe numbers don't improve much when you look ahead at least 6 months more: Only 2 percent of those surveyed indicated that they had plans to roll out EFSS at least 6 months for now. That's a slimmer 11.11 percent of the current corporate install base, using the same data set as a comparison point.\n\nAnd a massive 61 percent are in the 'no' category.\n\nSelling into the 4 percent that want to move in the next half year likely won't be too hard. The 2 percent that want to follow also might not be difficult to bring on board. But 61 percent are obstinate by their own admission.\n\nI think this could add more headwinds on the sales and marketing front. And that could harm long-term margins, and impair growth, two things that might ding valuations of private companies in the space.\n\nWe'll have to see. You can't divine precisely how much greenfield has been sucked from the EFSS meadows, but I would wager that the percentage isn't low.", "FROM EARLIER: Google kicks off special Black Friday and Cyber Monday Play Store sale\n\nAndroid users can download a variety of paid apps that are up to 50% off during Cyber Weekend, and games that are up to 90% cheaper during the same period.

(AP) -- A half-dozen potential Republican presidential contenders spent last week peacocking across the sprawling grounds of a pink-hued luxury resort, schmoozing with donors and sizing up the competition in the party's most fractured field in decades.\n\nThey rarely criticized each other in public, but there were subtle jabs.\n\nWithin hours of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gracing the cover of a magazine in an illustration of him kissing a baby's head, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal suggested the party needs bold leaders, not showmen.\n\n\"We have enough politicians who try to be celebrities and kiss babies and cut ribbons,\" Jindal said.\n\nWhether it was an intentional shot at Christie or not, the looming 2016 contest changed the context of every speech, interview and panel discussion at the Republican Governors Association's annual conference. The summit at the oceanside Boca Raton Resort & Club felt like a test run for what is increasingly shaping up to be a brutal showdown for the GOP presidential nomination among more than a dozen potential contenders, including a cluster of governors.\n\nIn contrast, Hillary Rodham Clinton has spent recent weeks basking in the glows of grandmotherhood and applause at a few public events -- without any major challenger for the Democratic nod, should she choose to pursue it.\n\nWhile the potential GOP field appears stronger than four years ago, the Republicans are without a front-runner.\n\n\"There are, like, 16 people who could run,\" said former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who downplayed the potential risk of so many candidates at each other's throats. \"They won't all run, of course, but a lot of quality in there.\"\n\nThe candidates aren't expected to start formally declaring their intentions until the first quarter of next year. But the developing tensions were already apparent as five potential candidates appeared together on stage in a packed, grand ballroom to answering questions from moderator Chuck Todd, the host of NBC's \"Meet The Press\" -- a dress rehearsal of sorts for the looming primary.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, a former congressman, repeatedly crossed words with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, challenging Walker's telling of the history of the Bill Clinton administration. On another panel, Walker mentioned that he'd been in high school at a time when Kasich had voted on a piece of immigration legislation.\n\n\"Well, you don't look that much younger,\" Kasich quipped.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry left little doubt that the race is on.\n\n\"I think the campaign has engaged. We're talking about issues here that are going to affect the presidential election in 2016,\" Perry said. \"I think we need to have this conversation with America.\"\n\nThe governors who would be president agreed on one thing: their superiority as candidates over their nongubernatorial competition. Those in attendance repeatedly stressed that the party's best hope for reclaiming the White House lies with a chief executive at the top of the ticket.\n\nBut they dismissed the idea of any kind of advance pact to ensure they don't inflict too much damage during the primary.\n\n\"Um, no, no pacts, at least none that I'm involved in,\" said Christie, joking that he'd be closely watching Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, another potential contender, to make sure he wasn't forging any deals.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, that's exactly what the contenders were aiming for.\n\nDozens of the party's biggest donors enjoyed private audiences with prospective candidates. They mingled in hotel corridors, at fancy dinners, on a nearby golf course where basketball great Michael Jordan was spotted, and at fetes, like an oceanside reception decorated with twinkling lights, a clam cake station and ice sculptures.\n\nThe guest list included Republican heavy hitters like Paul Singer, Anthony Scaramucci and Foster Friess.\n\nChristie, who arrived with what appeared to be his entire senior team, said he was enjoying spending time with donors \"in an atmosphere that's a lot more relaxed, like this one this week.\"\n\nIndeed, one top consultant who has served as senior adviser on numerous campaigns was spotted walking through the lobby in his bathing suit on the way to the pool between meetings. And at all times, lobbyists from companies like Google hovered, slipping business cards to governors and aides, who left one speed dating-style session with pockets bursting.\n\nStill, the presidential undertones were more subtle at times than in annual retreats of years past when prospective candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani held private meetings to craft campaign strategy with key supporters.\n\n\"In prior election cycles, the RGA postelection meeting has been the kicking off point for presidential campaigns,\" said GOP operative Charlie Spies, who led Romney's super PAC in 2012, echoing several other longtime attendees. \"This year's event was more low-key.\"\n\nThe event was \"not about asking. This is about thanking and congratulating,\" said longtime Republican adviser and money man Fred Malek. \"Part of it also is inspiration so that people will have their mind set on moving ahead in the next cycle.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow Jill Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj and Steve Peoples at https://twitter.com/sppeoples", "I still have my old copy of Quotations From Chairman LBJ. The book was inspired by Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung (\"the little red book\"). Compiled by Jack Shepherd and Christopher Wren and published by Simon and Schuster in the annus horribilis of 1968, the book consisted of supposedly laughable quotes attributable to President Johnson. It was popular enough to go through multiple printings. My copy derives from the third printing. Despite its success as a publishing venture I can't find much in the book that in the fullness of time has proved laughable or derisory except the attitude it displays toward Johnson as the left turned on him.\n\nThe form has been dedicated to documenting the supposed stupidity of Republican presidents such as Ronald Reagan (Reagan Quotes, compiled by Mark Tracy from two books by liberals about Reagan) and George W. Bush (George W. Bushisms, compiled by Jacob Weisberg).\n\nWe're well past the time when the form should be resurrected for President Obama. David Boze took a worthy pass at such a project with The Little Red Book of Obamunism (2012) but earlier posts in this series demonstrate the need for something comprehensive and updated.\n\nThe White House has now posted the transcript of President Obama's remarks on immigration in Chicago this past Tuesday. The speech gives us some truly quotable quotes to be included in Quotations from Chairman Barry.\n\nHere is the chairman warming to his subject:\n\nIf you go to -- I was just traveling in Asia -- you go to Japan, they don't have problems with certain folks being discriminated against because mostly everybody is Japanese. (Laughter.) You know? But here, part of what's wonderful about America is also what makes our democracy hard sometimes, because sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently.\n\nNow this could (and should) lead to a profound meditation on Americanization and the American idea, but Obama's promotion of immigration assaults them as well as the sovereignty of the American people. Thus Obama continues with this gem for our anthology:\n\nAnd that [tribalism], sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration. If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, well, I don't want those folks. Even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. (Applause.)\n\nDon't bottleneck me, bro!\n\nIn this reading, the American people have lost the right to control immigration in their own interests. Bill Voegeli has a timely discussion of the train of thought implicit in Obama's remarks in his essay \"Left, Right and Human\" in the current issue of the Claremont Review of Books (currently accessible to subscribers only). Bill writes in part on this point: \"From the liberal premise that differences between people are merely superficial, it follows that there are no compelling moral reasons to exclude people from around the world who would prefer to live here, not elsewhere. Who's to say, after all, that that their ways are worse than our ways? By what right must they change just so we can feel more comfortable? An immigration policy compliant with liberal sensibilities does as little as possible to exclude people who want to come here, and then asks as little as possible of people who want to stay.\" To the standard liberal mix described by Voegeli, Obama adds malice toward the American idea and the American people.\n\nObama's Chicago speech also gave us his unscripted confirmation of what we have been saying about his royal decree regularizing the status of millions of illegal aliens contrary to the law of the land. Obama had previously asserted some twenty-plus times that he lacked the constitutional authority to alter immigration law unilaterally precisely as he has now done.

(\"Birdman\" and \"The Theory of Everything,\" playing locally at the Tower, are both excellent.)\n\nRead on for my reviews of a couple other low profile but high-quality films that are worth your time and money.\n\nBeyond The Lights\n\nThis African-American love story set in the pop music world is an unusually good drama that unflinchingly portrays the sexism rampant in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe very talented Gugu Mbatha-Raw (\"Belle\") stars as Noni, a beautiful British singer who idolizes Nina Simone but instead ends up singing slick hop-hop music with a vile white rapper who is also her sort-of boyfriend.\n\nMinnie Driver plays Noni's cruel stage mother, and Nate Parker has the film's other clich\u00e9d role, as Kaz, a \"hot black cop\" who saves our heroine from a suicide attempt and then falls in love with her.\n\nIf all of this sounds dreadful, it actually isn't, believe it or not, thanks to the raw and mostly realistic work of director Gina Prince-Blythewood and her two gifted and gorgeous lead actors.\n\n\"Beyond The Lights\" is currently playing at two theaters in Sacramento, but not for long. You can see it this weekend at the Regal Natomas Marketplace Stadium 16, or the UA Laguna Village 12.\n\nRosewater\n\nJon Stewart, the great television host and political satirist, turns out to also be a talented film director, a skill that might never have been discovered had he not felt guilty after an Iranian-born reporter from Newsweek was imprisoned in Iran and tortured for 118 days after a filmed skit on \"The Daily Show\" jokingly referred to the journalist as a potential \"spy.\"\n\nIt seems that terrorists do not understand irony or satire, but Stewart, of course, is a master at both, and \"Rosewater,\" despite being a serious and valuable dramatic work, also contains traces of Mr. Stewart's wonderful sense of humor.\n\nThere is a funny joke at the expense of Newsweek early in the film as our reporter hero, Maziar Bahari, attempts to disarm his interrogator, and Bahari's teasing descriptions of the liberal sex life of a \"spy\" are amusing because his conservative, anti-Western captor is clearly turned on by the pretend details the journalist spins in order to survive.\n\nThis is not a comedy, however, and Stewart very effectively shows the impossibility of attempting to reason with terrorists. The film is all the more devastating because the actor that plays Bahari, Gael Garcia Bernal, is so gentle and likable.\n\nBernal, who is actually Mexican, doesn't sound Iranian, and he doesn't look anything like Bahari, but he has such a decent, sympathetic presence that the odd casting actually works.\n\nWhen Bahari's ordeal is finally over, and he is released in to his mother's arms, you want to stand up and cheer.\n\n\"Rosewater\" is currently playing at two theaters in Sacramento, but not for long. You can see it this weekend at the Century Laguna 16, or the UA Olympus Pointe 12 in Roseville.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\n\n\"Mockingjay\" is yet another single book split in to two films, and the movie is essentially biding time until the revolution gains traction in the fourth and final film.\n\nKatniss is understandably in shock after her ordeal during the games, but she is soon persuaded to join the rebels who seek to take down The Capitol, the totalitarian regime responsible for the sadistic competitions that turned our heroine in to a cunning killing machine.\n\nJennifer Lawrence, who is by far the best reason to sit through these movies, is supported by a dream cast that adds the great Julianne Moore to an ensemble that already includes an embarrassment of acting riches known as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stanley Tucci, and Jeffrey Wright.\n\nIt's indicative of this installment's especially somber tone that Elizabeth Banks' great clotheshorse character, Effie Trinket, is mostly sidelined in \"Mockinjay,\" and when she does show up she is disappointingly and depressingly dressed down.\n\nThere are also no games in this installment of \"The Hunger Games,\" unless you count the ones that Donald Sutherland's villain plays, or the ones that the rebel leaders play to get Katniss to assume her at first reluctant role as the face of the revolution.\n\nThere is also the ongoing problem that both actors who play the heroine's love interests, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, are attractive but miscast and dull.\n\nSo the bottom line is that \"Mockingjay\" is kind of a bummer. Rather than the exciting sci-fi action flick that the first two films were, the story this time out is more of a political thriller and a media satire.\n\nWatching \"The Hunger Games: Mockinjay - Part 1\" reminded me of how much I disliked the penultimate \"Harry Potter\" film, which led up to the far more satisfying final movie that concluded the enormously popular Hogwarts film franchise.\n\nThank God then that Jennifer Lawrence is once again on her game as the intensely sympathetic and gutsy heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who will I trust be given a better opportunity to kick ass next year when Part 2 of \"Mockingjay\" is released.", "North Koreans who risk their lives fleeing the country's fiercely oppressive regime could be refused asylum in the UK after a court judgment backing the Home Secretary Theresa May.\n\nHuman rights activists warn that a recent tribunal ruling could see hundreds of North Koreans automatically turned away from the UK and sent to South Korea - where refugees often complain of discrimination - even if they have never lived in the country before.\n\nIt comes as the Prime Minister David Cameron attempts to adopt a more hard-line stance on immigration levels following a surge of support for Ukip. In a recent asylum appeal decision, several North Koreans fighting the Home Office over their deportation to South Korea were told that legally \"all North Korean citizens are also citizens of South Korea\".\n\nThe anonymous appellants included a couple who were detained and beaten by North Korean authorities after an initial escape to China failed when they were unable to find work, but who successfully fled a second time in the wake of a show trial that left them shunned and abused in public. The family have no ties to South Korea, having never visited South Korea.\n\nThey arrived in the UK illegally in 2007 seeking asylum and have since had two children in Britain, but they are considered to be Korean rather than British.\n\nThe appeal decision, made in September, ruled that the \"appellants are South Korean citizens and their asylum appeal must fail\".\n\nA 33-year-old man who also appealed was deemed to have no \"entitlement to international protection as a refugee, by way of humanitarian protection or on human rights grounds\".\n\nLord Alton of Liverpool, co-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, told The Independent immediate deportation for those who have escaped from Kim Jong-un's totalitarian state is all the more likely given the \"present climate\" of anger over immigration.\n\nHe argued that the UK's \"tradition of accepting North Koreans\" is now under threat. He added: \"I'm concerned that we're going to automatically turn down people coming to the UK.\"\n\nRefugees in the South are granted largely the same rights as those born there and are given financial support, including around \u00a35,650 for a deposit on a flat.\n\nBut the International Crisis Group has warned that South Korea is struggling to handle the refugees who are often shocked by \"a bewildering rush of modernity, consumption and choice that rapidly overwhelms them\".\n\nPoorly educated, they struggle to find work and \"complain of discrimination by Southerners, who have stereotyped them as heavy drinkers, prone to crime, shirking work and relying on state hand-outs.\"\n\nJames Burt, research and policy officer at the European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea, said the decision set a \"dangerous precedent\".\n\nHe argued: \"This ruling would seem to stand even if a North Korean refugee in the UK has never been to South Korea, has no wish to be a South Korean citizen, has no links to South Korea. We believe that North Korean refugees should be given a choice as to where they settle, bearing in mind the horrific journeys that many have faced in fleeing their homeland.\"\n\nIt is thought that there are more than 1,000 North Koreans living in the UK, and in 2010 there were 581 refugees.\n\nIn an answer to a parliamentary question on the ruling, the Home Office minister Lord Bates said: \"All asylum claims from North Korea continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights against the background of the latest country information and relevant case law.\"", "Do you have a question about New York's complex and sometimes terrifying housing laws? Native New Yorker columnist Jake Dobkin has been receiving a lot of these questions lately, and he's decided to kick some of them over to his dad, longtime NYC tenants' lawyer and housing activist Steve Dobkin. If you have a question, email us and we will pick the most interesting ones to pass along to him.\n\nToday's question comes from a deliveryman who can't stand it when a fancy building requires him to hand over ID just to bring food up to a customer.\n\nSo I deliver somewhat fancy food to somewhat fancy buildings. A lot of these buildings have policies that really dick me around -- especially when I have to, with my one paper bag, exit the building, walk around the block to the service entrance, and then come back into the same lobby I was just in. But one thing I'm not sure about is ID stuff.\n\nIt annoys me to show ID to enter a building, but I get it. But how about the occasional building that makes you give them your ID to hold onto while you're in the building? Is that even legal?\n\nI told the guy to just copy it down and please give it back; it stresses me out to leave it with people. I know it seems like a small thing, but other poor/lower middle class types will know why this annoys me.\n\nSince 9/11, purported concerns for the security of residents have been used to justify a host of measures invading the privacy of tenants, family members, guests, and visitors. The likelihood is that a delivery guy would be treated by the average judge with even less deference than a visiting in-law.\n\nIn 2005, Peter Cooper Village installed a massive electronic key card and video surveillance system which required tenants, family members and anyone who entered the buildings on a regular basis to use an encrypted key card with their picture on it. The Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association challenged the system in Court and at the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (\"DHCR\") on a multitude of grounds, from violating leases and the Rent Stabilization Law to totalitarian enslavement, but in the end the Landlord's repeated mantra of \"Security,\" backed by recommendations from a former FBI agent, two independent consultants, and the NYPD Crime Prevention Unit, outweighed all resistance.\n\nCynics and tenant activists suspected that the real motivation for the installation of the computerized key system was to measure the comings and goings of tenants for use as evidence against them in non-primary residence proceedings, a key feature of the campaign to eliminate long-term lower-rent-paying tenants.\n\nThe 2006 opinion by the DHCR Commissioner, which was upheld by the State Supreme Court, noted that since \"security personnel may review the photos of card key holders as they enter their buildings, via the integrated CCTV system, it is only logical to allow security personnel to be able to ask for a photo ID of non-key card holders.\"\n\nFrankly, it's hard to envision a realistic scenario in which you, as a delivery guy, will be in a position to challenge building management's holding onto your ID while you're in the building. Be thankful you haven't (yet) been subjected to extraordinary rendition to a black site.\n\nThe opinion herein does not constitute legal advice, which may only be given in the context of a lawyer-client relationship.", "Nov. 28 (Bloomberg) -- When North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un visited the country's cartoon film studio, his sister Kim Yo Jong was on hand as he \"gave field guidance\" to animators, signaling a growing role in her brother's regime.\n\nKim Yo Jong yesterday was identified as a deputy director of the Workers' Party of Korea by the official Korean Central News Agency in its report of the visit, the first time she had been cited with an official title.\n\nBelieved to be about 27, about four years younger than her brother, she had been shown more frequently in his presence this year in the official media. When Kim was absent from the public eye in September and October, Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a group of defectors based in South Korea, wrote on its website that Kim Yo Jong was effectively in control.\n\nKim Jong Un exercises dynastic control over the North's 1.2-million troops and nuclear arms program, and the totalitarian regime's isolation and lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand the inner workings of the so-called hermit kingdom. Kim showed last year that family ties can quickly be broken when he ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song Thaek, once considered to be his de facto deputy.\n\n\"Kim Jong Un was parachuted into a country effectively run by a whole lot of old men in uniforms,\" said Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University. \"The execution of his uncle, Jang Song Taek, and now bringing forward his sister is a way of pushing back on them and trying to get control.

He wraps himself in the American flag and declares he is only taking this action because Congress has failed to act. The question the mainstream media and the public should be asking is, \"Can the American public withstand two more years of Emperor Obama and a failed presidency?\"\n\nI am a lifelong gun owner and a nationally ranked NRA marksman back in 1970. I agree with the Ninth Circuit Court and Lee Bird, in \"Keep your guns, keep your freedom\" [Letters, Nov. 18], that San Diego's restriction on concealed carry permits was unconstitutionally restrictive.\n\nI disagree, however, with Mr. Bird's use of NRA slippery slope philosophy, denouncing all gun restrictions or controls as steps toward confiscation and totalitarian rule.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' stastics show that only a small minority of guns used in crimes are stolen. Seems that it is too easy for bad guys to get anything they need through a private party, gun show or internet sales. Friends and relatives act as other untraceable sources, through straw purchases, loans, gifts or inheritance.\n\nRational people should recognize a societal need to ensure that weapons in the hands of responsible, law-abiding owners cannot legally be transferred to the irresponsible. Reasonable laws can be forged to do this.\n\nI believe that the NRA attitude against universal background checks indicates that they actively encourage sales, transfers and gifts of firearms to people who could not pass a background check.", "When North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un visited the country's cartoon film studio, his sister Kim Yo Jong was on hand as he \"gave field guidance\" to animators, signaling a growing role in her brother's regime.\n\nKim Yo Jong yesterday was identified as a deputy director of the Workers' Party of Korea by the official Korean Central News Agency in its report of the visit, the first time she had been cited with an official title.\n\nBelieved to be about 27, about four years younger than her brother, she had been shown more frequently in his presence this year in the official media.

Eucharist means \"thanksgiving\". That means that the center of our Faith is thanksgiving. It is in the form of a thanksgiving meal that our Lord chose to make Himself present to us. And He did so, shockingly, \"on the night He was betrayed\". In other words, he defiantly gives thanks and praise to His Father in precisely the place where we humans immediately turn to make the most obvious case for atheism -- the place where the enraged atheist cries out and says, \"If there is a loving God, why do the innocent suffer horrors and die in torments with nobody to help them?\" Jesus was that innocent one. A few hours after His defiant act of thanks, He would sweat blood in prayer and go (seemingly) unheard to a kangaroo court, a horsewhipping, and to a horrific death surrounded by taunts and jeers.\n\nAnd yet, He gave thanks and taught us to do the same in memory of Him. That's because \"for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God\" (Hebrews 12:2). In short, He knew that however sad our earthly story is, the truth is that God is love and that the real story of the universe is eucatastrophe that climaxes in Joy, beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief (as Tolkien put it).\n\nAccordingly, when the world gets me down, I think one of the best things a Christian can do is defiantly give thanks, and assume a sort of willful and rebellious (to the prince of this world) attitude of cheerfulness that imitates Jesus' counter-cultural happiness. It's subversive and one of the great and fun things about being a Christian. So:\n\nThanks be to God for God. That's at the heart of all Christian praise. The sheer stunning fact that God is at all, quite apart from any possible goodies He gives us. In all the good things around us, the miracle is that, before they are, He is. The Life pulsating at the center of things, the Being who speaks all beings into being.\n\nThanks be to God that He is a He and not an it. That too is at the heart of all Christian praise: the conviction that our God is personal and not a mere force or fate. That He is truly greater than we, not merely in terms of raw power, but in the fact that He is more personal than we are. Thanks be to God that we do not cower before Tash the Inexorable, but bow like free men and women before the Lord who made us in his image and likeness.\n\nThanks be to God that He is so personal that He is three Persons and not a lonely monad floating in the ether. Thanks be to God that He is Love and not mere Thought.\n\nThanks be to God that it is in Love He created the world. Thanks be to God that our earliest intuitions of the Beauty that lies behind the beauty we see all around us is not a cheat, fraud, delusion or snare, but our primal sacramental encounter with the truth of things: that God is good. Thanks be to God that, even since the fall, and all we have done to screw things up,\n\nfor all this, nature is never spent;\n\nThere lives the dearest freshness deep down things;\n\nAnd though the last lights off the black West went\n\nOh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs --\n\nBecause the Holy Ghost over the bent\n\nWorld broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.\n\nThanks be to God for permitting the Fall, and for remaining with us (and with me) through all our pagan wanderings. Thanks be to God for his mercies when we broke His heart, and His inexhaustible love when we made ourselves into things only God could love. O Happy Fault, O Necessary Sin of Adam, that won for us so great a salvation!\n\nThanks be to our great God Jesus Christ for his sacrificial death for our ungrateful and unhappy race. The longer I live, the more appreciative I become of the sheer human courage it took to do what He did for us. \"Jesus died for our sins\" can take on a certain sing-song hypnotic quality, like the Pledge of Allegiance or any other piece of rote repetition. Reading the gospels as human documents before receiving them as divine ones, what strikes me is simply how much guts our Lord displayed in going up against a power structure that hated Him, a foreign occupier who regarded Him as either a number or an insurgent, and a mob that saw in Him merely a piece of meat to beguile a few hours with the pleasure of watching a victim in torments. For Him to pour out His whole heart and soul for such a race, and for Him to continue doing it down the ages despite the fact that our ingenuity in cruelty only becomes sharper as we prepare for Armageddon... what words of gratitude can there be for such love? Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner!\n\nThanks be to God the Holy Spirit, for the sheer plenitude of strange and beautiful ways the Lord, the Giver of Life, has given life to the world. Thanks be to Him for the astonishing variety of his creatures: for four-eyed fish, and dinosaurs, and my dog Snoopy when I was a boy. Thanks be to Him for the Life betokened by life and for the astonishing and simple grace of Baptism through his amazing creature Water.\n\nThanks be to God for His astounding gift of Holy Church: for the fathers and mothers of our faith who were willing to endure such torments because they saw the heavenly Zion and could not wait to get there. Thanks be to Him for pouring out on his Church such a vast treasury of beauty, wisdom, goodness and sanity in the middle of a world that holds it all in utter contempt even as it benefits from it. Thanks for the breathtaking generosity of spirit from His servants in giving and giving such goodness to the world even as the world takes it and tears it to tatters. Thanks that even that spite becomes yet another occasion of grace. And thanks for the miracle of conversion and the tenderness with which you welcome each of us fools to the new birth, Lord. Thanks especially for welcoming this fool and putting up with his folly and stupid pride all these years. It's a good thing you promise eternal life, Lord. Because it will take that long to get my soul in shape to be worthy of a tiny fraction of the generosity you keep pouring out. You are the everlasting river that wears mountains down in time. Thank you.\n\nThanks be to God for the inexhaustible life of the sacraments -- especially the Eucharist, wherein, to my astonishment, I get to receive the blessed Son of God into my very guts. Thanks for the heartbreaking mercy I have found in the confessional, where the love of God meets me again and again and speeds me on my way both to the unthinkable gift of the Blessed Sacrament, and to a second chance at life. Thanks be to God for the sweet sacrament of marriage and the heartachingly beautiful gift of Janet, who has been my friend and model of sanctity for nearly three decades. Thank you for the blessing of each one of our sons, who are in their wonderful ways, growing to be the human beings and men of God that we pray for each day.\n\nThank you for the sheer providential care, the astonishing unlikelihood, of my being at all -- the infinitude of chances, choices, and cooperations between grace and nature that made it possible for that particular sperm and that particular egg to meet when and where they did. Thank you for defective diaphragms! It is a mystery that boggles my mind and overwhelms thought, yet to you it is simplicity itself, Lord. I don't understand it in the slightest, but I am grateful for it beyond words.\n\nThank you for my father and mother: the first sacrament of your love I ever had. Thank you for Dad's determination to be the father he never had and the loving husband and provider that my mom needed. Thank you for his openness to grace when he was so badly deprived of contact with the gospel. Thank you for my mother's love and bravery in raising us and losing him. Thank you for my brothers, whom I worshipped as a child and whom I admire still and love to spend time with. Thank you for memories of being turned invisible by Mike, of seeking Rick's wisdom about who invented shoes, of garden hose water fights and old home movies and Christmases that lie 52 years thick and full of joy in my heart still.\n\nThanks be to God for the country and civilization into which I was born! Without my deserving it at all, I was given riches I could not (and still can't) imagine, free of charge, by countless people who lived and died all the way back to Adam. They handed me a language, a massive treasury of art and thought and courageous sacrifices so that the world I entered was a quiet street in Everett, Washington and not a salt mine, or a war-torn hellhole, or a totalitarian nightmare or an abortuary. Thank you for the vision, still not wholly lost, of the country described in the most beautiful anthem our heritage has ever produced, \"America, the Beautiful\". Thank you for this nation with the soul of a church. May God thy gold refine.\n\nThanks be to God for my native land of Washington, and the stunning beauty that greets me simply by looking out my back window each morning. Thank you for the shady bower of the alder tree that stands outside my window, and for the window (and the hobbit hole house) it stands outside of.\n\nThank you for health and the goodness of 21 Century medicine. Thank you that I am alive after illnesses that would have killed people a century ago. Thank you that my wife did not die in childbirth and that my son did not suffer brain damage from a labor that would have done both a few decades ago. Thank you for novocaine, aspirin, and codeine!\n\nThank you for work and the technology to do it! Thank you for literacy and the army of teachers who gave it to me and my readers. Thank you for the countless people who make it possible for these words to get from my computer (a mysterious gift of grace I do not understand at all) over the Internet (another mystery of grace) to Inside Catholic (yet another mysterious cooperation of man and God that produces good fruit by his divine power).\n\nThank you for the bare elementals of existence like air, earth, water and fire. Thank you that the very dirt I walk on is the labor of billions of years and that any stone I might chance to pick up has been around longer than the dinosaurs. Thank you for the mysterious gift of water, for the air (which I would really miss badly if it were denied me more than a few seconds), and for the plain light of the sun, the one thing I can look at knowing that Jesus Christ saw the same thing.\n\nI could go on and on Father, but I just wanted to take some time and give you a smidge of the gratitude you deserve. It doesn't add anything to your glory and happiness, I know. But it's still, as you teach us, \"right to give you thanks and praise.\" Thank you that even in that, your generosity is such that you turn it to our good by making our hearts a little larger so that there is more room for you. Blessed be the Name of the Lord!"]}}
