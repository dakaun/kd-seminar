{"Samsung": {"2017-09-28": ["Samsung's Active line of flagships has been an AT&T-only zone for years. Since the first S4 variant launched in 2013, big blue has held exclusivity to the rugged flagship. (There was one sprint S5 variant, but it wasn't called Active.) But the days of AT&Tyranny for the Active line are coming to an end. It looks like the durable IP-68 version of Samsung's flagship is headed to T-Mobile. At least, someday.\n\nVentureBeat reports that marketing material they've had access to points to the handset coming to the magenta-colored carrier. The model number will be the SM-G892T. The AT&T model was identical but for an A at the end, for reference. It should also come in the same Meteor Gray and Titanium Gold colors it did previously.\n\nThey don't have any data that points to when the new model might be released so it could be a while. VentureBeat also found other references to a possible universal version, the SM-G982U, that is showing up in some certification databases. That might imply yet another SKU is out there, and it could even be unlocked since most phones with a \"U\" in Samsung's model number scheme typically are.", "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai urged Apple Inc. on Thursday to activate FM radio chips in its phones in the interests of public safety during natural disasters.\n\nOne problem: Newer iPhones don't even have an FM chip.\n\nIn a statement, Pai laid out the case for activated FM chips, which can give cellular phones the ability to tune in to potentially life-saving information over the radio during a natural disaster, especially when cellular networks are knocked out, as they were when recent hurricanes battered the U.S. and Caribbean.\n\nA week after Hurricane Maria, the FCC said 90% of cell towers in Puerto Rico are still out of service, as are two-thirds of the ones in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nFM radio signals can travel much farther than cellular data signals, making them a potential lifeline in an emergency. Every major smartphone manufacturer that sells in the U.S., including Samsung Electronics Co. 005930, -0.81% , Lenovo Group's 0992, -1.15% Motorola, LG Corp. 003550, +1.16% and HTC Corp. 2498, +2.03% , has FM-activated chips in their most popular phones. Except one.\n\n\"Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so. But I hope the company will reconsider its position,\" Pai said.\n\nIn a statement, Apple AAPL, -0.62% said \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\"\n\nWhile it was unclear exactly why newer iPhones do not have FM chips, some manufacturers use the plugged-in headphone cord as an FM antenna. But starting with the iPhone 7, Apple's phones don't have a headphone jack, and without an antenna, an FM chip is useless.\n\nApple said it \"cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis,\" noting that emergency services can be dialed from a locked screen and that its phones enable government emergency notifications. But those functions would not work when wireless networks are down.\n\nFor years, Pai and the National Associated of Broadcasters have urged phone manufactures to activate FM chips. Pai has said in the past he is against rules requiring activated FM chips, instead hoping companies just do the right thing.\n\n\"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first,\" he said.", "Alongside all the new Echo devices Amazon announced on Wednesday, the company also revealed a subtle but significant shift in its smart home strategy.\n\nAlexa is no longer just a layer of voice controls that supplements other smart home systems such as Samsung SmartThings, Alphabet's Nest, Philips Hue, and Lowe's Iris. Instead, it's becoming a full-blown smart home platform, replacing many of the functions that those other systems provide.\n\nThe implication is that Amazon doesn't want to play a supporting role in smart homes anymore. Instead, it wants a hand in every interaction, even if voice isn't always involved.\n\nPart of Amazon's shift comes from the tools it's now offering to device makers. In a press release, Amazon describes a new version of its Alexa Smart Home API as \"the largest improvement ... since it was launched in April 2016.\"\n\nThe most notable change is support for routines that trigger several actions at once. This allows a user to say \"Alexa, goodnight,\" and have the system lock the doors, turn off the lights, and lower the thermostat. Alexa will also provide more feedback on device state, so users can check on the thermostat temperature or ask if any lights are on. Meanwhile, the Alexa app will serve as a central dashboard, where users can monitor and control their devices.\n\nThese are not new concepts for smart home systems, and they're not even new to Alexa. Samsung's SmartThings platform, for instance, already supports multi-device routines that users can trigger through Alexa voice commands, as does Wink. But that's the point: Instead of leaning on those companies for home automation, Amazon now wants to handle the automation itself.\n\nStill, Amazon can't fully replace other smart home hubs without offering one of its own. To that end, the company announced a new connected speaker called the Echo Plus. It has the same design as the original Echo, but adds a ZigBee radio inside.", "The iPhone has what's arguably the best mobile processor in town. The A11 Bionic is as fast as in benchmark tests as some of the most recent Intel chips that power Apple's MacBook Pro, and well above what's possible on Android devices. We've now witnessed various real-life speed tests starring the new iPhone which showed how much faster the handset can be when it comes to day-to-day tasks. But a brand new showdown with the Galaxy Note 8 reveals that Apple may have a problem on its hands.\n\nTo recap, the iPhone 8 Plus crushed the Galaxy Note 8 in 4K video processing tests. But it also lost a similar battle to last year's iPhone 7 Plus, and showed weakness in the most recent comparison with the Galaxy Note 8 in one critical department: RAM management.\n\nYou'll see the same thing happen in the following video. The \"standard\" speed test is performed in PhoneBuff's clip, where both the iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 have to open a series of apps twice. Whatever phone is the fastest overall, wins. The first lap measures how fast each phone opens apps, including basic ones and resource heavy apps. The iPhone is slower when it comes to tiny apps, but wins big when it comes to games and other apps that require more processing power.\n\nThe second lap looks at RAM management, which is where Samsung's 6GB of RAM shines, as all the apps opened on the first lap remain available. Meanwhile, the iPhone 8 Plus keeps some games open but has to reload others. This is what helps the Galaxy Note 8 finish both rounds before the iPhone 8 Plus.\n\nWhat that means for users is that the more apps you have open on an iPhone right now, the less likely for you to pick up where you left off in all of them. For Apple, it means it has to further optimize app management and transitions, and fix RAM management if it needs fixing. If there's one other thing the iPhone is well-known for is being able to quickly bring apps back from memory. The fact that iPhone 7 Plus was faster in a similar test than the iPhone 8 Plus seems to indicate the newest iPhone still needs some work. Also, iOS 11 is anything but polished right now, so there will be plenty of improvements to come.", "Whether you're aware of it or not, your smartphone probably comes equipped with an FM chip. It's an important little piece of technology that remains one of the better ways to communicate over long distances in disaster situations, being that it isn't reliant on cell phone service.\n\nDespite its usefulness, the chip has largely remained dormant in most smartphones sold in the US - until recently, that is. In the wake of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, most major phone manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung and HTC have enabled the functionality for their users.\n\nApple, however, has remained curiously resistant to this trend and that's not sitting well with some.\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday issued an official statement urging the tech giant to \"reconsider its position\" on the activation of this important piece of tech in the iPhone.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the full statement:\n\n\"Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted [activating the FM chip]. But I hope the company will reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. That's why I am asking Apple to activate the FM chips that are in its iPhones.\"\n\nPai asserts that it's time for Apple to \"step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first,\" while applauding the phone manufacturing companies who have already done so.\n\nApple's reasoning behind resisting this request is still unclear but some publications have speculated that the company might be trying to avoid competing with its own music streaming service, Apple Music.\n\nThough Pai has admitted in the past that a case could be made for the blanket activation of FM chips on \"public safety grounds alone,\" he is reluctant to create an official ruling on the subject given his stance on free market policies (as evidenced by his views on net neutrality).\n\nApple responded to Pai's comments in the following statement to MacRumors:\n\n\"Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and that's why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products. Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\"\n\nThis explains why Apple hasn't enabled FM chips in newer iPhones, but not why they haven't done so for older generations of the device.", "Your employees depend on you to lead them through a challenging time -- here's how to lead effectively following a company-wide red alert.\n\nBusinesses are made up of imperfect human beings (at least for the time being). And, as humans, we sometimes make mistakes. Most snafus consist of something minor -- you forget to send your team a meeting agenda and everyone shows up unprepared, or an email typo causes an embarrassing situation with a new colleague.\n\nThen there are the instances when small mistakes cause huge problems for a business. Take Amazon Web Services, for example, whose massive outage earlier this year was caused by nothing other than an honest mistake on a programmer's part. No biggie, right? Wrong: One incorrect command caused internet chaos, amounting to more than $300 million total in lost revenue.\n\nThankfully, most small business owners will never face an incident of this magnitude. But only a lucky few of business owners will never encounter some type of company crisis that takes a major toll on their team. When those crises occur, how should we, as leaders, respond?\n\nRecently, I asked myself this question with a greater-than-normal sense of urgency as my company hit its own speed bump. Some months before, we had implemented a software update that, well, went wrong.\n\nMake that \"horribly\" wrong beccause, while we typically release product updates once or twice a month, and most go off without anything more than a hiccup (which can be addressed right away), this particular update was different.\n\nLet's just say it didn't go exactly as planned.\n\nThe release -- one of the biggest we'd ever done -- included changes to the core of our system. And although we had gone through the normal process of testing and sign-off, we realized in retrospect that it was too large a release to be handled in our typical manner.\n\nAs a result, many of our clients were unable to access parts of the system, and some components of our application didn't work properly. The result? Before we could even fix the issues, some clients began looking elsewhere for a replacement.\n\nWith 100 employees, our business was, and is, large enough and financially strong enough to withstand an elevated churn for a period of time. Unfortunately, though, an issue like this can put other small companies out of business. Not to mention the damage wrought by client and employee concerns about a company's stability. Such concerns have the potential to significantly impact a business over the long haul.\n\nSimply put, businesses faced with a serious incident need to act quickly and carefully to avoid a tense situation turning chaotic.\n\nRelated: Taking the Bite Out of a Workplace Crisis\n\nBut as awful as situations like these might be, they also provide unique opportunities to build trust -- not only with your clients, but also your team. Going through a traumatic situation with others brings you closer together and helps form powerful bonds. It also builds strength, character and confidence. As difficult as it is to tackle a tough situation, the company and team involved can become more resilient than ever. Indeed, many businesses not only recover from bad situations but go on to be even more successful in the future.\n\nHere are some ways we got our own team through that product update gone wrong. These are tips that any small business faced with a red-alert issue can put into practice:\n\n1. Be more observant than ever. Sometimes, in a work environment, it's easy to miss subtle cues about how people are feeling. After a difficult event, you have to be hyper-aware, and you have to take action. If you see that employees seem stressed out, tell them to go home or give them the next day off. For many, that willingness to reach out is tough: A Harris Poll survey indicated that a whopping 69 percent of managers surveyed said they felt uncomfortable communicating with employees; but your team will appreciate that you cared enough to address the problem.\n\nPart of being observant is also knowing when to jump in and help. When my company faced its crisis, staff from other departments pitched in to take calls from clients when the support team became overwhelmed. Our entire team operated with a sense of urgency and helpfulness. We never pointed fingers. We stuck together and focused on the job at hand.\n\nRelated: Multiply the Trust Factor Inside Your Organization\n\n2. Don't sugarcoat what everyone went through. Be honest about the pain that your team has suffered as a result of the incident, but also be hopeful about the future. When things began to settle down at my company, it was clear that nerves were frayed and our staff felt beaten up. I remember walking around the office and being taken aback by how exhausted everyone looked. The event really took a mental toll on my team.\n\nWhat got us through our situation and allowed us to move on was the same thing anyone would do for a friend going through a tough time: We let people talk about their thoughts and feelings; we were supportive and helped one other as much as we could.\n\nNot only is this the right thing to do from a human relations standpoint, but studies show that truly listening to your staff helps with retention. Plus, employees who feel that their voices are heard are nearly five times more likely to feel empowered to do their best work.\n\n3. Refocus on company values, goals and projects as quickly as you can. When a natural disaster occurs, we commonly hear leaders talking about getting back to normalcy. It's the same with work issues.\n\nWhen Samsung experienced its now infamous exploding battery debacle on its Galaxy Note 7, the company not only had to deal with the outcry from customers and the media, it had to regain the confidence of its staff. The company did this by refocusing on its business goals and values. In doing so, the organization created a new inspection test and an eight-point analysis. The point was to ensure that in the future this type of flaw would be caught during the testing phase, and not by customers after the product went live.\n\nAt our company, we simply resumed business life as usual. We went back to our daily stand-ups, held our regular all-hands meetings again and got back to working normal hours. We didn't deny what had happened. As a matter of fact, we continued to talk about it and adjust processes to prevent it from happening again. But we didn't dwell on it.\n\nRelated: 8 Ways to Stay Calm During a Crisis\n\nWhen a major issue occurs at your company, it's a true test of leadership. Will you kick into action, or will you allow the stress of the situation to get the best of you? The bottom line is this: A company crisis is when your employees need you most. They need to know that you care, that you truly believe that everything will be okay and that they can depend on you.", "So our F&P top-loading washing machine is on the way out after about 10 years of hard work; I'm increasingly looking towards replacing it with a front loader (never owned one before) and would be in boots and all but for two major provisos: 1. hard towels and 2. limitations on adding stuff mid-load. Going by earlier threads here on GZ, the first problem seems to be able to be at least mitigated by slower spin speeds and judicious use of detergent, but I'm not sure about the second issue.\n\nCan most/some/all front loaders be at least easily paused to add items mid-cycle? How does the process work - do they take a few seconds to reduce the water level to below that of the door before releasing the catch? And, if so, is the water at least put into a reservoir or would it need to replace this water (which I would have thought could reduce detergent levels)?\n\nAre any of these methods employed practical, easy and not-too-slow to use in real life?\n\nI'm seriously looking at the Samsung range that feature the \"addwash\" feature, which is essentially a chute/door within the main door allowing items to be added at any time (I think) - in particular this model. Would this be the most practical solution to my second issue?\n\nI'm looking for something of at least this size (8.5kg), and ideally lower than or around this price ($1200 on special), so any specific recommendations gratefully received.", "Would you pay $1000 or more for a new phone? Apple is counting on it with the iPhone X -- the \"X\" symbolizing the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Fans of the company are falling all over themselves to justify the price, with many forgoing the more affordably priced (and available) new iPhone 8 models. But it's hard to say the X is anything \"new\" when you compare it to what Android phone have been doing for a while.\n\nThe X will be available on November 3. Today, you can get a slightly cheaper and less rah-rah bragging rights Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for a list price around $900. Samsung is throwing in $200 credit to buy extras on the Note given its ah, flaming, reputation and making sure everyone knows the battery on the 8 has been tested, double-tested and won't burst into flames.\n\nHow many features does the X and 8 share? Edge-to-edge OLED screens, no physical \"home\" button, wireless charging, 12MP dual-lens cameras, water and dust proofing, Both the X and 8 (and Galaxy 8) have facial recognition technology, but nearly everyone will freely admit Apple's Face ID technology is a lot better. Face ID might be too good in some respects, if you are worried about having your phone unlocked at a police station without a warrant, but that's a discussion for a different day.\n\nIf you want an iPhone X, you can't even pre-order one until October 27. Media reports suggest orders for the currently available (and cheaper) iPhone 8 and 8 Plus aren't that great because Apple fans want the top of the line X and aren't going to settle for lesser phones. The OLED edge-to-edge display, better cameras, and Face ID are the features being touted as reasons why people are passing on the iPhone 8 family and waiting for the X.\n\nThe single unique feature that carries the X past both the iPhone 8 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is Face ID, the technology used to unlock the X. Analysts believe it will take time for the market to accept FaceID as being reliable, not-hackable, and too easy for a third-party to simply hold up the phone in front of your face to unlock it. Huawei released a video mocking Face ID on September 18 while plugging its forthcoming Mate 10- #TheRealAIPhone- on October 16, proving if nothing else Apple is setting the conversation topics.\n\nFinancial analysts are worried Apple might not be able to keep up with demand for the X while at the same time managing to suppress sales of the available-now iPhone 8/8 Plus series. Fewer units mean less profits and lower earnings, meaning Apple could end up with both unhappy fans and a most unhappy Wall Street if it can't crank out the phones fast enough.", "In this guide we'll explain the benefits of getting a fast charger for your new Galaxy Note 8 and share a list of the best options available. Not all wall chargers are equal, and getting the right one will make a big difference in terms of how fast the Galaxy Note 8 recharges.\n\nLike most recent phones, the Galaxy Note 8 has a feature called Fast Charging technology. This enables it to recharge at an extremely fast pace, and do it safely. Old wall plugs won't work right and will take over 2 hours to recharge your phone.\n\nRead: 40 Neat Galaxy Note 8 Tips & Tricks\n\nSamsung provides one fast charger in the box, but you'll want more than one. There are multiple brands that offer \"fast chargers\" and we recommend one from the reputable brands in our list below. Some cost as little as $9.99, while others from Samsung cost more but ensure the safest charging levels. Below we'll also explain how quick chargers work.\n\nA technology called \"Qualcomm Quick Charge\" was announced a few years ago, and allows smartphones to recharge faster than ever before. Samsung's phones use that same technology, or something nearly identical. Rather than taking 3 hours to recharge, it only takes about 80-100 minutes. Additionally, the Note 8 can go from 0-50% in 20 minutes. With the right charger, of course.\n\nWhen the battery is below 10%, it charges at an incredibly fast rate and gets nearly 50% battery capacity in under 25 minutes. Instead of being tethered to a wall, use your phone all night or at work without worry. Fast charging will slow to a safer level after 50% capacity to preserve the life of the battery cells. Basically, it knows when to slow down so your battery lasts for years, not months. Unlike some of those iPhone friends of yours that have phones that only last 3-4 hours a charge. That's because the battery degrades over time.\n\nBelow is a preview of how it works on an old Motorola phone, which works nearly identical to Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charging on the Galaxy Note 8.\n\nThe phone with a fast charger received over 50% battery life in the same amount of time the other only received 22% battery life. That's a big difference you will notice each and every day. This requires a Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 certified wall charger, or Samsung's certified \"adaptive fast charger\" that comes in the box with each Note 8.\n\nOld spare chargers or something bought from a gas station likely won't offer these speeds. The best way to check is to look for the \"fast charging\" notification on the bottom of the screen during the recharge process. If you see that, the charger is compatible with this newer technology.\n\nSo here's the problem, only one of these chargers comes in the box with the Note 8. Now that you know how fast and convenient this is, you probably want more. Choose some from our list below and get a fast charger for every room in the house, or for your desk at work.", "The Galaxy Note 8 is one of Samsung's best smartphones yet and it offers plenty of neat features your last phone didn't have. These tips and tricks will help you master your new phone. We'll go over steps like transferring data from an old phone, creating GIFs with the stylus, running two apps at once and even add a bit of customization to your Galaxy.\n\nYou won't need to read the boring manual or take hours looking through the settings menu. Instead, our guide will help you learn how to use the phone and all the cool features that you paid for.\n\nRead: 20 Best Galaxy Note 8 Cases\n\nThis is a big phone with a beautiful screen and tons of features that take full advantage of it. With our help, you'll master the Galaxy Note 8 in no time. We'll start with changing tons of settings to improve your experience. Then detail a bunch of helpful Note 8 tips, tricks, and hidden features.\n\nFor starters, let's transfer your old phone to the new Galaxy Note 8. No one wants to lose all their settings, texts, call log and pictures. Here's how to keep everything.\n\nSamsung has a feature called SmartSwitch, and this will automatically transfer your old phone, Galaxy, iPhone and more to the Galaxy Note 8. It does literally everything for you. Just find SmartSwitch in settings, use the adapter that comes in the Note 8 box, and connect it to your old phone. You can do this entire process over WiFi too if you don't have a cable or the adapter handy. Just follow the on-screen instructions when you open the app.\n\nFind the little dongle (pictured above) that plugs into the Type-C charging port, and hook it up to both the new and old phone. Open SmartSwitch on each phone to start the transfer, or use a PC if needed to backup data, then restore it to your Note 8.\n\nWhen your first setup the phone (or if you want to redo it) this is how you should proceed. Full instructions for setting up a Galaxy, and using Smart Switch is right here. It's from the Galaxy S7, but the same steps apply to the Note 8.\n\nThis will transfer most of your settings, apps, wallpapers, texts and more. Once that's all done, here are the other tricks you'll enjoy.\n\nThe Note 8 has a massive 6.3-inch Quad-HD Infinity Display. It's so big and tall that some apps don't use the entire screen. If you see black bars on the top and bottom of certain apps, enable fullscreen app mode for a better experience.\n\nOur image above is a quick glance at exactly what you'll be looking for. This will force apps into full screen mode on the Galaxy Note 8. Again, most apps work just fine out of the box. The ones that aren't highlighted work as soon as you manually force it with our instructions above. Like Snapchat and some games. Now you're enjoying apps and games on the entire screen you paid for.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8 screen is capable of a 2k resolution, higher than most HDTVs. However, Samsung ships it running at 1080p, known as FHD. This may help with battery life, but it also means you aren't getting the full resolution that the screen can offer.\n\nHere's how to upgrade your screen instantly in settings. Go to Settings using the steps mentioned above and look for screen resolution. Slide it over to WQHD+ 2,560 x 1,440 and hit apply.\n\nOne of our favorite features is the Always-On display. Giving Note 8 owners quick information like the time, date, battery levels and even incoming notifications. This uses hardly any battery life, too, which is nice. Even better, it's highly customizable.\n\nWhen the screen is \"off\" it's still technically on. A small area gives you at-a-glance information. We can change the entire look and feel of the always-on display, add a calendar, or even a background image.\n\nGo to settings and search for always on display. Tap the On toggle to turn it on if it isn't already. Or tap the option to enter the customization section as shown above. Samsung occasionally updates this with more features too, so check back occasionally to see what's new. If you don't like it, you can turn off the Always-on Display.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner is helpful when it comes to keeping your phone safe and secure. However, it does a lot more than that. Instantly sign into websites, accounts, banking apps, or even use Samsung Pay. All of this works without passwords once you set up the fingerprint scanner.\n\nHead to the settings menu and find Lockscreen & Security, or search for it using the search bar at the top. In here, scroll down the Fingerprints to get started as shown above. Now, follow the on-screen prompts and add a fingerprint or two. Apps like Bank of America will give you an option to use fingers instead of a password.\n\nYes, we just mentioned how great the fingerprint scanner is. However, it's also in a pretty poor location and is hard to reach for some. If so, use an awesome feature called Smart Lock and skip the fingerprints as often as possible. This uses trusted locations and connected devices to skip unlocking the phone when it knows it's in a safe place.\n\nGo to the same Lockscreen & Security section in settings mentioned in our last tip. Now, find Smart Lock and enable it.\n\nYou'll see four different modes to choose from, pick whichever works best for you. I'm using Trusted devices and Bluetooth, so when I connect the Note 8 to my car stereo or it's near a smartwatch I don't need to unlock it. The software recognizes I'm near a trusted device and bypasses the lock screen method temporarily. Smart Lock works with any NFC or Bluetooth device.\n\nOnce you leave your house or are no longer connected to the car stereo, you'll need a password or fingerprint again to unlock the Galaxy Note 8. You'll love this feature once it is all set up.\n\nWe have one more tip that relates to the fingerprint scanner. Samsung added a few gestures so you can swipe the scanner to perform a few tasks on the phone. Here's a video guide on the Galaxy S8. The steps are exactly the same on the Note 8.\n\nSamsung offers something called the Secure Folder, and it's really impressive. Basically enterprise-grade security for anything and everything on your phone. Install a second Gmail or Facebook for work, and lock it safely in the secure folder. Take pictures and hide them here, or put important documents behind a lock and key.\n\nSamsung calls this a Secure Folder and it's built into your Galaxy Note 8. You need to use your fingerprint, Iris or password to access this folder.\n\nGo to Settings and search for Secure Folder. If you haven't already you may need to sign into your Samsung account. Choose an unlock method and then start enjoying a more secure Galaxy Note 8.\n\nThere are two easy ways to find a lost or stolen Galaxy Note 8. One is Google's Find My Device, and the other is just like Find My iPhone, only its made by Samsung. Set this up BEFORE a phone gets lost.\n\nIf you lose your Galaxy Note 8 or it is stolen, you can use this service to track it down, make it play a loud noise if it's lost at home, or erase everything in cases of theft.\n\nGo to Settings and search for Find My Mobile. Log in with your Samsung account, or create an account, and then turn it on. Our screenshot above is Google's service, but they both work the same. Make sure you allow any prompts to use your phone's location and use Google Location service so you can easily track a lost phone.\n\nSamsung includes a handy feature that lets you keep all of your games in one location and allows you to play without interruptions by blocking notifications. You can also choose to mute the game sound or put the phone in a high-performance mode for better graphics at the expense of battery life. Furthermore, there's a built-in screen recording mode.\n\nGo to Settings and search for Game Launcher. Toggle it on and then you will see a new folder on your home screen. This should have your games in it and plenty of neat options and controls.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8 includes a new voice assistant called Bixby. This is like Siri, Alexa, or the Google Assistant, only different. Samsung claims Bixby learns from us as we use it, and developers can use and take advantage of Bixby too. As a result, we could see some neat Bixby features later down the road.\n\nHere are 175 Bixby Voice commands that you can use to control your Galaxy Note 8 with just your voice. It does a lot more than the Google Assistant if you ask right, so try it today.\n\nOne frustrating aspect of the Galaxy Note 8 is apps being out of order in the app tray. Especially once you download a bunch from Google Play. Each downloaded app goes to the end of the list, in no specific order. Thankfully there's a way to quickly re-sort them all in alphabetical order. Basically cleaning up the application tray.\n\nSwipe up from the bottom of the screen, then tap the 3-dot settings button at the top and select \"A-Z\" and then tap save. Now all of your apps get displayed alphabetically and are easier to find. The next time you install an app though, you'll have to do this again, as it reverts back to the list format.\n\nAnother feature we love that millions don't use is Do-Not-Disturb. It works great on the Note 8 and will keep you free from distractions at night or while working. Keep the phone on when you need it, and have it automatically go silent or on vibrate at work, or at night.\n\nTo use this navigate to Settings > Sounds > Do Not Disturb or just search for Do Not Disturb. Turn it on or set a schedule so everything happens automatically. Don't forget the \"allow exceptions\" at the bottom so select contacts or apps can still get through at all times. Perfect for friends, family members or your boss. Samsung offers an option where repeat callers will still get through, in case of emergencies.\n\nKeep in mind that this won't even let alarms get through if you don't set it up and allow a few exceptions. Once it's done right though, it's a lifesaver.\n\nDo-Not-Disturb is great at night, and the Blue Light Filter is too. It's like night mode. This turns off certain blue colors on the screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep faster. Studies have shown the blue light from displays, especially Samsung's can keep users awake and cause eye strain. Samsung even has a sunrise and sunset toggle so it's on only at night.\n\nHead into Settings > Display > Select Blue Light Filter and use the schedule option if you'd like. Now the screen will be much warmer with less blue light, and easier on your eyes.\n\nJust like the Always-On display, the blinking notification LED light is very distracting at times. Here's a quick guide for turning it off.\n\nHead to Settings > Display > LED Indicator and turn it off. However, this also means you won't see a notification LED when the phone is charging. Our link above explains how to turn it off for certain notifications, but keep it on for the ones you need.\n\nThose who want to customize the look and feel of the Galaxy Note 8 will want to check out the Theme Store. It comes on every recent Samsung phone, and it's extremely powerful.\n\nGo to Settings and navigate to or search for Wallpapers and Themes. Download the Theme app if it isn't there already, then browse through hundreds of themes and wallpapers. Many of them are free, but there are others that you will need to pay for if you want them. Download any theme then hit apply. Material Blue gives the Note 8 a stock Android look, which is my favorite.\n\nNever miss the perfect photo opportunity by instantly and quickly launching the Galaxy Note 8 camera. Instead of finding the app, just double tap the power button -- even with the screen off. You'll see a prompt when you do it the first time, but if you didn't turn it on, you can do it now.\n\nGo to Settings and search for Quick Launch Camera. Turn on the slider to enable this feature. Now you can quickly double press the power button to open the camera. It fires up in less than one second.\n\nThere are plenty of neat things you can do with the dual cameras on the Galaxy Note 8. Zoom in close on subjects, take portrait photos and more. However, we like the new Dual Capture feature. Basically, this lets you take two photos at the same time.\n\nLaunch the camera, swipe from the left edge, and select Dual Capture mode. This new mode allows you to capture both a regular and a zoomed in photo at the exact same time. One click, two photos. Yes, it's sort of a novelty feature, but I've had countless moments where I take a photo and crop it later. This way, you'll probably already have the perfect shot.\n\nNow that you know how to quickly launch the camera and can take two photos at the same time, here are a few more tricks and things to know. Start with our how to use the Galaxy camera like a pro guide. This covers;\n\nSpending just a few minutes to get familiar with the camera will make your photos turn out better, look great, and get more likes on social media. Try your luck with these best photo editing apps too.\n\nThen, don't forget to try the new 2x optical zoom feature right on the middle right side of the camera view. This uses the second camera lens to get extremely close photos. Samsung also improved the selective focus feature where you can change the point of focus before and after you take a photo. Just swipe from the side, choose selective focus, and enjoy all the options.\n\nOne of the most popular 3rd party apps for Android is keyboards. From SwiftKey, Google's GBoard, Swype and more. Allowing users to type faster, add customization, and have more control. Samsung's keyboard is decent, but here's how to change it.\n\nHead to the Google Play Store, search for your keyboard of choice (Gboard) and install it. Once it's done open it up, follow the prompts, and it will set the Note 8 to use it by default. Other apps do the same thing so we don't have to fumble around in the settings menu. Now, enjoy a better keyboard experience.\n\nAnother thing we can change and customize is the font. Samsung includes a few different font options themselves, but you can download more if you'd like.\n\nThe video above is a quick walkthrough on how to change the font on the Galaxy S8. These same steps apply to the Galaxy Note 8.\n\nIf you don't have time for the video, just go to Settings > Display > Screen zoom and font and tap on Font Style. Now you can choose the one you want or tap the + to download more fonts. Give it a try today.\n\nA lot of people choose the Note line for the big screen. If you're one of them and the software is too confusing, or you just want to see things easier, try Easy Mode. This simplifies the software and increases the size of everything for those with poor vision.\n\nJust head to Settings > Display > Easy Mode and turn it on. You'll notice everything changes and gets bigger, even the icons are large. Everything that's important is easy to find and use, including big icons for your favorite contacts. This is perfect for parents, or grandparents. It basically simplifies everything for those wanting an easier experience.\n\nThis phone has a huge 6.3-inch display and the device is long and skinny. As a result, it's hard to use with one hand for some owners. If you're struggling, try One-Handed mode. This puts everything in fingers reach, minimizes windows, and is probably just what you were hoping to find. Even the keyboard is off to one side.\n\nStart by going to Settings > Advanced Features > and turn on One-Handed Mode. From here there are two options to turn it on or off: Swipe up diagonally from the corner to shrink the screen contents or tap the home button 3 times to quickly reduce the screen size. Notice the smaller easy to use phone dialer in our screenshot above. Try it today.\n\nEvery carrier likes to add extra apps and bloatware that most owners never use. These waste space and take up room in the application tray. Sadly we can't uninstall these, but we can disable and \"hide\" them from the system. That way the application tray is clean and only shows what you want and need, not all those AT&T, Amazon or Verizon apps you'll never use.\n\nHead to Settings > Applications > Click on the app > hit Disable. Confirm you want to disable it, and it will be gone forever until you re-enable it in this same menu. Be careful not to disable any system apps or important things. I typically remove all the carrier and Amazon apps, NASCAR stuff from Sprint, etc. This makes your app tray cleaner and easier to use too.\n\nOnce you disable all the bloatware another step worth taking is moving apps to a microSD card. This way you keep the 64GB of storage that's built-in for games, photos or recording video. Here's a detailed guide for transferring content to the microSD card on the Note 8.\n\nHead to Settings > Applications > and hit the drop-down icon near the top left and select All Apps. Now, search for any app you downloaded and click it. Then follow the steps in the guide or our screenshot above to transfer it to your microSD card. You can't transfer pre-installed apps, keep that in mind.\n\nBeing able to use two apps simultaneously is nothing new to Samsung smartphones. However, the Note 8 has a new feature called App Pair, where you can instantly open two apps together at the same time. Pair apps together, and tap once to instantly multitask like a pro.\n\nOpen the Edge Apps panel (if you didn't disable it) and look for App Pair. Now just pair apps you like together and use them as you see fit.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8 hotspot feature allows you to share your internet connection with a laptop or tablet. Basically, other devices connect to the Note 8 just like you sign into Starbucks or Airport Wifi. Most smartphone plans support this and if you have an unlimited plan you'll never run out of data.\n\nDo this completely wireless, or use a USB cable for what's called USB Tethering. Go to Settings > Connections > Mobile Hotspot and Tethering > Mobile Hotspot. Here you can name the hotspot and create a password for it. Once you're done, test it on a computer or tablet before you go mobile and need it. Here's more on how this works and how to set up a USB connection and quickly turn the hotspot on and off.\n\nIf you notice my settings menu is different in these screenshots, it's because I'm using the Material Blue theme from the theme store we mentioned earlier. Giving my Note 8 a stock Android look and feel.\n\nA new feature most don't know about is something called Dual Audio. Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0 on the Note 8 we can send two different audio outputs to two different devices. Or the same sound to two different Bluetooth speakers. Additionally, BT5.0 reaches 8x further, connects 4x faster, and is just better overall.\n\nHead to Settings > WiFi & Bluetooth > Turn on Bluetooth and tap the three dots near the top right of the screen. Choose Dual audio and turn it on. Now when music is playing there is a control center in the notification bar to completely control audio unlike ever before.\n\nCapturing whatever is on the Note 8 display is very easy by taking a screenshot. People do this to share things on social sites, or save information. Simply press the power and home button down at the same time, hold until you see or hear the screenshot capture, and let go. It's that simple.\n\nRead: How to Take a Screenshot on the Galaxy Note 8\n\nYou can capture an entire text message conversation, web page or email using the scrolling screenshot feature too. Follow our guide above to learn how.\n\nScreenshots are nice, but creating a GIF is even better. Using the S-Pen you can capture part of any video playing on the Note 8, edit that clip, and save or share it as a GIF. Or is it JIF?\n\nStart a video using the Samsung Video player and click the icon circled in red above. That, or pull out the S-Pen and tap on \"Smart Select\". Use the S-Pen and drag a square the size of the area you want to record, and follow the on-screen prompts. Now record, crop, edit and share a GIF with friends and family.\n\nA highlight new feature on the Galaxy Note 8 is something called Live Messages. While there are a lot of neat things the Galaxy Note 8 can do, this is one of our favorites.\n\nPull out the S-Pen and tap the Live Messages option. As you write the letters sparkle and glisten on the screen. Then, you can send that message as an animated GIF that essentially plays the message on the other end for whoever receives it. Perfect for saying Happy Birthday or things of that nature.\n\nThis next one is an old Android trick, but one that works amazingly well on the Galaxy Note 8. We can quickly change three little settings in a hidden developer menu and improve performance.\n\nOur video guide above is on the Galaxy S8, but the exact same steps apply to the Galaxy Note 8. Enable the hidden developer menu, find the three settings shown above, and turn them to 0.5x and enjoy the benefits. You'll notice the phone is faster and more responsive. You're welcome.\n\nWhile this isn't a big trick, it's a helpful feature that many don't know about. Close apps on the Galaxy Note 8 when they're no longer needed. Our video below shows you how on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8.\n\nWe explain why you want to do this in our video above. Basically, big apps drain battery life. When you're done using an app hit the recent apps button and swipe it away to close it. That, or close all at night or when headed to work to increase battery life.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8 gets good battery life but it can always be better. Not to mention sometimes apps can kill the battery in just a few hours. You can use this guide to fix bad Galaxy Note 8 battery life so that your phone lasts longer without the need for a battery case.\n\nIn less than 10 minutes you can fix most Galaxy Note 8 battery life issues on your own, without a trip to a carrier or a call to Samsung.\n\nRead: 15 Common Galax Note 8 Problems & How to Fix Them\n\nBattery life is just one of many problems users may face. If so, check out our list of 15 common problems above and how to fix them.\n\nAnother useful software tweak from Samsung is Quick Settings. Pull down the notification bar and there are a bunch of quick and easy to access settings at the top. Pull down again to expand it with even more options, screen brightness slider and more. Additionally, this is all customizable so it fits your needs exactly.\n\nSo, swipe down twice and you'll see the entire quick settings menu. Now, long-press and hold down any icon, then drag it where you'd like. I keep a list as my first five which are WiFi, Bluetooth, Vibrate (or Silent mode) the Flashlight, and now the Blue Light filter or Airplane mode. Drag and drop what you need at the beginning for easy access.\n\nSamsung's Note devices have big screens, and that means there is extra room for more apps on your home screen. Older Note phones had 5 apps across, but the Note 8 went back to 4 app icons. The home screen icon grid layout is customizable, so you have more apps on your screen at once.\n\nPress and hold anywhere on the screen that doesn't have an app icon. The display will zoom out into an edit mode where you can also add a wallpaper or try themes. Click on home screen settings, then choose either \"home screen grid\" or \"Apps screen grid\" to change how many apps are on each row. This works for the home screen and your application tray.\n\nYou bought a Samsung Galaxy, and that means you have access to the easiest and best mobile payment system on the market. Samsung Pay is incredibly easy, and very useful.\n\nSimilar to Apple Pay or Android Pay, we can make payments at stores throughout the United States, and select other regions with the Note 8. Samsung Pay works anywhere Apple Pay is accepted using NFC, and nearly 98% of all stores in the US because it's backward compatible with magnetic swipe-based credit card terminals. So leave your wallet at home, and pay for anything just by tapping your phone to the terminal.\n\nOpen Samsung Pay (or download it from Google Play) and add a credit card by using your camera, then secure it with a fingerprint. Get everything set up right, enjoy some free money from Samsung for registering, and start earning reward points along with enjoying the convenience. More info on Samsung Pay is right here.\n\nIf you have a wireless printer, you can print stuff right from the Note 8. You'll need a plug-in for it to work, but it's very simple.\n\nOpen Settings > Connections> More Connection Settings > Printing > Download Plugin > Download Google Cloud Print > Follow on-screen instructions for setup and you're done. Now print from your Note 8.\n\nNow that we went over tons of helpful tips, these next two are for saving you when you run into trouble on the Galaxy Note 8. If your phone is frozen or unresponsive, here's how to quickly reset it.\n\nTo reboot a frozen Galaxy Note 8 press and hold down both the power button and volume down for 7-10 seconds. The phone will shut down, reboot, and be back on in no time. This fixes almost any small problem you might face and is a great way to fix a frozen phone.\n\nLast but certainly not least is how to perform a factory data reset. This is great for fixing any major problems, starting fresh after a software update, or before you sell the phone. A factory reset will erase everything, so back up your Note 8 before you proceed.", "Toshiba has brought a torturous eight-month saga over the future of the Japanese giant close to an end by signing the $18bn (\u00a313.4bn) agreement to sell its memory chip business to a consortium including Apple.\n\nA group led by Bain Capital that \u00adincludes Apple, IT company Dell and computer storage providers Kingston and Seagate are involved in the deal, which Toshiba hopes will improve its precarious balance sheet.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate was thrown into crisis earlier this year by the collapse of its US nuclear unit Westinghouse, which sent it to a huge loss that led to fears it could be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n\nIts woes led to concerns over the \u00adfuture of Toshiba's Moorside power plant project in Cumbria, the UK's largest nuclear project.\n\nThe company's chip business is the world's second biggest manufacturer of flash storage, memory components that sit at the heart of smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics.\n\nToshiba bosses have squabbled for months about how best to sell the unit and the process has been marred by \u00adlegal challenges from its partner Western Digital, which claims it has a veto over any sale process.\n\nGoogle, Amazon and Foxconn have all been rumoured as potential bidders, although the consortium has been a front-runner for months.\n\nBain will take a 49.9pc stake in Toshiba Memory, with Toshiba retaining 40.2pc and Japanese disk company Hoya holding the rest. Apple, Dell and others are providing financing for the deal instead of taking a stake. Toshiba's memory unit was once a market leader but has fallen behind Samsung as it failed to come up with the substantial investment needed to develop flash memory and focused on its nuclear business.\n\nApple's involvement in the deal suggests it fears Samsung, an arch-rival in the smartphone and tablet business, growing to dominate the market. Higher prices for flash memory units are believed to be behind recent price rises applied to the iPhone.\n\nThe deal, which Toshiba had originally hoped to be agreed in a few weeks, still faces several hurdles. Western Digital has brought a case at the International Court of Arbitration to try and exercise its veto right. Meanwhile, the involvement of fellow chipmaker SK Hynix, one of the firms financing the deal, could lead to competition fears.\n\nIn a discouraging emblem of the chaos that has surrounded the deal, a Tokyo news conference announced by Bain to discuss the agreement yesterday was called off after some of the consortium members said they did not want to discuss it publicly.\n\nToshiba continues to seek investment for the Moorside nuclear project in Cumbria, after French firm Engie abandoned its support of the venture.\n\nLast week it emerged that Chinese nuclear giant CGN was interested in taking an equity share, a move which would see its stake in the UK's nuclear ambitions grow. South Korea's Kepco has previously voiced interest.", "Turbine company seeks injunction against water well activists citing 'safety risk'\n\nWater well advocates in Chatham-Kent are expected to learn whether they'll be able to continue blockading wind turbine sites when a judge rules on a temporary injunction against them Monday.\n\nA Chatham courtroom was packed Thursday morning as Pattern Development and Samsung, the two companies behind the North Kent Wind project, faced off against Water Wells First, a group that occupied one of their construction sites for 11 days.\n\nThe companies are seeking an injunction that would stop the protests they describe as a \"serious safety risk.\"\n\nCourt first heard from Cindy Soney, a First Nations woman who stated she was the only person who shut down machinery during the demonstration. She added the land where the turbine project is taking place is owned by Canada's Indigenous people.\n\nPattern Development lawyer Jim Bunting argued other protesters trespassed on the company's construction site several times prior to August. He also told the judge that the protesters yelled at workers and vandalized company equipment.\n\nMore than a dozen people in Chatham-Kent claim the construction of the 34 turbines is contaminating their well water.\n\nPattern and Samsung are both denying those allegations.\n\nThe companies are using the injunction to ask the court to order the protesters to stay away from the construction sites.\n\nJudge Kirk Munroe is expected to give his decision Monday at 2 p.m.", "Samsung's Gear IconX aren't the best earbuds in the truly wireless earbuds game -- but for today, at least, they might be the best value. Samsung has the original version of the IconX on sale for $49.99 right now. It's apparently a \"closeout sale,\" which means that Samsung is trying to get rid of every unit it's got left. That makes enough sense, since a new model of the IconX is coming out later this fall.\n\nThe IconX were announced in June 2016 and originally sold for $200. They were fine enough earbuds, but they weren't worth the price. Their sound and Bluetooth performance were okay, but battery life was really weak: the IconX are only supposed to be able to stream music for about an hour and a half at a time. So while $50 might not be a bad deal if you want a pair of wireless earbuds for occasional use, their overall use is really limited.\n\nSamsung's new model of the IconX, the IconX 2018, is entirely designed to address its battery shortcomings. Nothing has changed on the 2018 model except the battery life, which has been extended to an estimated five hours of streaming music playback. That's a much better number and rivals what Apple estimates its AirPods can offer.", "Toshiba (Swiss: TOSH.SW - news) said on Thursday it had formally signed a deal to sell its memory chip business to a group led by US investor Bain Capital for around $18 billion.\n\nThe sale to the consortium -- which includes US tech giants Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) and Dell as well as South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (KSE: 000660.KS - news) -- is seen as crucial to keeping the struggling Japanese conglomerate afloat.\n\nThursday's signing caps a months-long saga that saw heated courtroom battles, rival bids and the near-delisting of one of Japan's best-known firms.\n\n\"Today we signed a deal to sell\" all the shares of its prized memory chip business to the consortium with a price tag of two trillion yen ($18 trillion), Toshiba said.\n\nThe Japanese firm had already said last week it would sell the business to the Bain-led group and aims to complete the sale by March.\n\nToshiba is the world's number-two chipmaker behind Samsung and the division's products are found in many smartphones and electronic gadgets.\n\nThe chip unit accounts for around a quarter of Toshiba's total annual revenue and is the crown jewel in a vast range of businesses ranging from home appliances to nuclear reactors.\n\nToshiba narrowly averted a delisting this year, but it still faces the humiliating prospect of being yanked from Japan's premier stock exchange if the sale does not raise enough money.\n\nSelling the chip division is seen as key to Toshiba's survival, as it battles to recover from multi-billion-dollar losses at its US nuclear (Other OTC: UCLE - news) operation Westinghouse Electric.\n\nThe Japanese industrial giant is still recovering from the disastrous acquisition of Westinghouse, which racked up billions of dollars in losses before being placed in bankruptcy protection.\n\nThose huge losses came to light as the group was still reeling from revelations that top Toshiba executives had pressured underlings to cover up weak results for years after the 2008 global financial meltdown.\n\nIts most recent results published in August revealed a loss of $8.8 billion in the last fiscal year, although it predicted it would swing back into the black this year.\n\nThe losses were a major embarrassment for a cornerstone of Japan Inc, which traces its history back as far as 1875 when the company started life as a telegraph factory in what is now Tokyo's Ginza shopping district.", "Samsung's Galaxy S Active phones have traditionally been exclusive to AT&T, but according to a new report, that's changing with the Galaxy S8 Active.\n\nT-Mobile is planning to offer the Galaxy S8 Active, according to marketing material viewed by VentureBeat. The device is expected to be available in Meteor Gray and Titanium Gold and will reportedly carry the model number SM-G892T (the AT&T GS8 Active is SM-G892A).\n\nUnfortunately, there's no word on when the Galaxy S8 Active might launch at T-Mobile or how much it'll cost when it arrives. AT&T is currently selling the Galaxy S8 Active for $849.99.\n\nWhile this T-Mobile Galaxy S8 Active is still very much a rumor, there is one detail that could back up today's report. When AT&T announced the Galaxy S8 Active in early August, the carrier said \"For a limited time, the latest Galaxy S8 Active device will be exclusively available from AT&T,\" which makes it sound like the GS8 Active won't always be an AT&T exclusive.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 Active features a 5.8-inch 2560\u00d71440 Super AMOLED display on its face along with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. Around back there's a 12-megapixel camera with OIS and an LED flash, as well as a fingerprint reader to the right of the camera. Inside the GS8 Active's rugged shell lives a Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD slot, and a 4,000mAh battery.\n\nAs for the Galaxy S8 Active's body, it's got a metal frame with bumpers and a textured back for added grip. The device is touted as being shatter, dust, and water resistant.\n\nWill you consider picking up the Galaxy S8 Active if it launches at T-Mobile?", "ARLINGTON, Texas, Sept. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple is perceived by technology professionals to be the \"most technologically advanced\" company worldwide, according to a September survey by Decision Analyst, a leading marketing research and analytical consulting firm. Decision Analyst recently surveyed more than 1,000 technology professionals worldwide -- a group that includes engineers, scientists, computer programmers, and other technology executives. Survey participants were shown a list of 68 leading technology companies and asked to choose the five \"most technologically advanced\" companies. As the chart below shows, Apple was chosen by a higher percentage (46.9 percent) of technology professionals than any other company.\n\nThe perception of Apple as the top technology company was consistent across the technology professionals surveyed in the U.S., Canada, European Union, Russia, Asia, and Latin America. Other companies perceived as top technology leaders are Microsoft (40.4 percent), Samsung (36.9 percent), Google (34.3 percent) and Intel (24.4 percent).\n\n(Results for all 68 companies listed in the survey can be seen at https://www.decisionanalyst.com/press/2017/mosttechnologicallyadvanced)\n\n\"Apple is a great example of the power of consistent positioning and consistent execution of a strategy based on technically superior products, innovative design, high-quality manufacturing, premium pricing, and consistent advertising of its strategic positioning story,\" said Jerry W. Thomas, President/CEO of Decision Analyst. \"Apple demonstrates the power of strategy, long-term thinking and planning, careful and thoughtful research, consistent execution, and consistent marketing. Through ups and downs, Apple has never blinked or taken its eye off of the long-term goal. This stands in stark contrast to the short-term focus and short-term thinking that characterizes most large U.S. corporations,\" Thomas said. \"Apple pursues a business model other companies might want to study and emulate.\"\n\nMethods\n\nBased on secondary research and pilot studies, Decision Analyst compiled a list of 68 leading technology companies around the globe. The names of these technology companies were shown during the survey (randomized from respondent to respondent), and participants were asked to choose the top five \"most technologically advanced\" companies.\n\nMultiple answers were specified because of the large number of companies listed. Apple was chosen by a higher percentage of respondents than any other company. The sample size for the survey was 1,086. The standard error is about 3 percent, plus or minus, at a 95 percent level of confidence. The source of the online sample was the Technology Advisory Board (www.technologyboard.com).

They have great specs, sometimes nearly identical to the standard version but with bigger batteries and robust hardware designs. It's easy to see why some would enjoy them.\n\nFor the Galaxy S8 Active, it features a shatter resistant 5.8-inch QHD Super AMOLED Display with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, 4000mAh battery (with wireless charging), 12MP f/1.7 Dual Pixel rear camera, 8MP f/1.7 front camera, Bixby, and an outer shell made of military-grade materials that is shatter, dust, and water resistant (MIL-STD-810G).

But Google seems to have discovered that his pregnant, Google Home, has a defect that could cause them to lose market share : the quality of the sound.\n\nIf Apple has put in before, during the presentation of its HomePod, the sound quality of its speaker is connected with Siri, the Echo Amazon is also a good speaker front audio to be connected.\n\nGoogle would have in its cartons to its own stereo speaker\n\nAccording to the site 9to5Google, Google might be in plans to release a new speaker connected. Unlike the Amazon Echo Dot that reduces the size of the Amazon Echo, the new speaker of Google is called Google Home Max and would be larger than the pregnant Google Home classic. The name Max is not fixed, it comes from one of two sources of 9to5Google.\n\nThe big difference between this Google Home Max and the Google Home classic is at the level of the sound : the Google Home Max would have speakers capable of producing stereo sound. It is positioned in direct competition with the HomePod Apple, capable of producing stereo sound in 360 degrees, and the new Amazon Echo enhanced sound.\n\nA price not announced and no release date\n\nThe rumor from 9to5Mac seems coherent, whereas the war between the three major manufacturers of connected speakers is raging. But for the moment, Google has nothing announced : it may be that he would unveil the project during the conference it will hold on October 4, 2017 on the occasion of the release of the Google Pixel 2, its new smartphone home.\n\nIf this is the case, this will also be the occasion to discover the price of this Google Home Max : is she going to be more expensive than the Amazon Echo ($99) as is already the Google Home classic (129$) ? And compared to the HomePod Apple ($349) ?", "A series of reports offered somewhat conflicting details on Apple's iPhone X manufacturing process. Some said that Apple is pumping the brakes on certain component production even though the iPhone X is already delayed. Others said that Apple can't make enough iPhone X units to meet the expected launch demand because of the TrueDepth camera parts that have seen poor yields. Even still, that report said Apple may have at least 10 million iPhone X units ready for the early November launch.\n\nNow, a story from a reputable source says that \"Romeo and Juliet\" are to blame for the iPhone X's delays and continued production woes.\n\nIt's not Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but a pair of components that are known by the same name, The Wall Street Journal says:\n\nSpecifically, the Romeo module is the dot projector that beams 30,000 infrared dots across a user's face, mapping his or her unique facial features. As you might have guessed by now, the Juliet module refers to the infrared camera that reads the pattern created by Romeo. These are the pieces of the puzzle that make Apple's solution vastly superior and more secure than rival facial recognition tech from rivals such as Samsung.\n\nApparently, it takes more time to assemble Romeo than Juliet, which explains the imbalance in supply. The Journal's report also seems to explain Digitimes' earlier claims that said Apple is putting a temporary halt on production of certain iPhone X components. At the same time, some suppliers have to step up production to meet the minimum amount of parts Apple needs for this period.\n\nThese problems could \"crimp supplies beyond typical initial shortfalls when the phone is released\" November 3rd, The Journal says. Sources familiar with the matter added that the OLED screen made \"the iPhone X road to production bumpy,\" revealing that Apple initially planned to include a fingerprint sensor in the display itself. That approached proved to be problematic, and Apple eventually scrapped the plan, which contributed to the iPhone X release being pushed back to November.", "Since its release earlier this year, the Galaxy S8 Active has proven awfully attractive to those who want high-end power, but worry about dropping their smartphones and spending hundreds of dollars to get it fixed.\n\nImage: Keith Agnello/Tom's Guide\n\nThe problem with the Galaxy S8 Active, however, is that it's been an AT&T exclusive, making it nearly impossible for many customers to get it. But that's about to change, according to a report from BGR.\n\nSamsung has signed a deal to bring the Galaxy S8 Active to T-Mobile's stores, BGR is reporting, citing serial leaker Evan Blass. No official announcement has come yet, but it's believed that the smartphone will be available quite soon at T-Mobile stores.\n\nBut it gets better. According to the report, Samsung is also eyeing ways to get the Galaxy S8 Active to Verizon and Sprint store shelves in the near future, though exactly when that might happen is unknown.\n\nIn an interesting twist, T-Mobile has secured FCC approval to sell the Galaxy S8 Active, which has some industry-watchers wondering whether the smartphone will run on the carrier's extra-fast 600MHz LTE network. The Galaxy S8 Active is technically able to support the network band, thanks to its Snapdragon X16 chip.\n\nMORE: Samsung Galaxy S8 Active Review: Practically Indestructible\n\nSamsung released the Galaxy S8 Active earlier this year. The device has a slim bezel like the Galaxy S8, but its screen is flat. It ditches the physical home button, however, so a virtual home button allows for software control. The Galaxy S8 Active also works with Samsung's Bixby virtual assistant.\n\nAside from that, the Galaxy S8 Active has reinforced sides to protect it from damage, and is designed to reduce the amount of exposure a device gets from water, dust, and other particles.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 Active coming to T-Mobile would be good news for folks who like rugged phones, but it could also be a boon for T-Mobile to showcase how the handset might work on its new spectrum.\n\nSee Also : Best Waterproof and Water-Resistant Phones Galaxy Note 8 vs Galaxy S8: What Should You Buy?8 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked From Best to WorstBest Android Apps You're Not Using", "The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is no longer Samsung's newest phablet, that honour falls to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but it's still a recent phone, having launched this year, and still one of the biggest and highest spec handsets around.\n\nBut just how good is it really? We've put the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus through a full review to answer that question, as well as detailing all the key features of the phone.\n\nWith the impressive iPhone X about to land in stores this could be one of its main competitors, so is it worth the money?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a 6.2-inch 1440 x 2960 Super AMOLED screen with a pixel density of 529 pixels per inch.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack there. First off, that size makes it absolutely enormous, coming in just 0.1-inches smaller than the Galaxy Note 8. The resolution and pixel density meanwhile mean it's up there with the sharpest screens this side of the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. And Super AMOLED? That leads to great contrast, truly black blacks and vivid colours.\n\nIn short this is one of the best and highest end smartphone screens around, helped further by the fact that it's curved. That both makes it look futuristic - in a way that the iPhone X can't even match - and makes it more manageable in the hand, as well as eliminating the side bezel.\n\nIt also supports HDR content, and its 18.5:9 aspect ratio makes it super widescreen, so you can comfortably run two apps side by side when using the phone in landscape orientation.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is big at 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm, but not as big as you might expect, because like certain other 2017 handsets Samsung has removed most of the bezel around the screen, keeping the phone as compact as possible. To achieve this the fingerprint scanner has been moved to the back.\n\nIt's a premium design too, with a glass back and a metal shell ensuring the S8 Plus fits neatly into Samsung's high-end range.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is also IP68 certified dust and water resistant, meaning it can be submerged up to 1.5 metres deep for up to 30 minutes. Many high-end phones now have some amount of water resistance, but the S8 Plus has more than most.\n\nOverall the phone has a very familiar design at this point - Samsung would be wise to change things up for the Galaxy S9, but it's still one of the best-looking phones around.\n\nYou want power? You got power. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is one of the speediest phones around, thanks to 4GB of RAM and an octa-core Exynos 8895 chipset clocked at up to 2.3GHz. That chipset is top-end, arguably beaten by Apple's A11 Bionic processor, but not by anything you'll find in an Android phone.\n\nThe RAM amount meanwhile isn't quite top-end any more. Samsung's own Galaxy Note 8 has 6GB as do a few other phones, but the majority are still on 4GB or less and this amount doesn't seem to slow the Galaxy S8 Plus down.\n\nThe S8 Plus runs Android Nougat, which was the latest version of Android when it launched. Since then Android Oreo has landed, but we'd expect Samsung will update the phone to that before too long and you can generally expect Samsung to support the handset for a while yet.\n\nSamsung switched to a dual-lens camera for the Galaxy Note 8, but there's just a single-lens one on the Galaxy S8 Plus. That's okay though, because it's still very, very good.\n\nThe S8 Plus has a 12MP camera with optical image stabilisation (so your image stays stable and focused). It also sports an f/1.7 aperture, which means the lens opening is bigger than on many phones. That means more light can get in, which in turn improves low-light performance.\n\nIt's also fast to focus and features a wealth of camera modes such as HDR, smile detection and panorama. Although the dual-lens Note 8 has it beat, few other phones do.\n\nAnd there's a quality 8MP camera on the front too, with the same aperture, so you can take surprisingly decent low-light selfies.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has a few features above and beyond what you'd expect from a high-end phone.\n\nThere's Bixby for one. This is Samsung's alternative to Google Assistant and Siri, so it's an AI assistant in other words, and there's a dedicated button to launch it on the phone. It's better than it was when the S8 Plus first came out too, as it now sports full voice control, but you can still use Google Assistant if you'd prefer.\n\nOther extras include an iris scanner and a face scanner. The latter isn't as secure as Apple's version (it can be tricked by images of your face) but the former is quite secure, and not found on many phones. As optional alternatives to the fingerprint scanner they're nice to have, but if you're anything like us you'll probably mostly still use your digits.\n\nThere's a 3,500mAh battery in the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, which is a good size, bigger even than the Note 8's or the iPhone X's, so if battery life is important to you this could be the phone to go for.\n\nIn practice you're likely to get about a day and a half from a single charge with moderate use. That means you'll still be charging it nightly - unless you're happy to plug it in halfway through the day - but it will comfortably survive a late night. It also supports both fast and wireless charging.\n\nThere's 64GB of storage built in, which should be plenty for most users, but if not there's also a microSD card slot.\n\nConnectivity options include Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, NFC and Bluetooth 5.0 - which is far longer range than earlier Bluetooth versions.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is a good few months old now but it's still one of the best phones you can buy, especially if you're in the market for a phablet.\n\nIt lacks the Note 8's S Pen and its face scanner is less impressive than the one on the iPhone X, but otherwise this ticks all the high-end boxes, including a great screen, a premium design, lots of power and loads of extras.", "Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S7 is displayed at its shop in Seoul, South Korea, 21 November 2016 (Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters)\n\nVerizon Communications has just rolled out the August security patch to its Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, packed with bug fixes. Part of the update is the improvement on Wi-Fi calling.\n\nThe August security patch for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge variants under Verizon has firmware version NRD90M.G930VVRU4BQH4 and NRD90M.G935VVRU4BQH4, respectively. With all of its fixes, there seems to be one that fixes the Blueborne security vulnerability.\n\nAlso read: BEWARE! New phone scam tricks you to subscribe to paid services\n\nApart from the security patches, the devices also get improvements on voice recognition for OK Google and S Voice, Wi-Fi calling and some enhancements intended for corporate owners. Some users previously complained of some Wi-Fi voice call drops. The Samsung S Voice app performance has been enhanced, while the OK Google command detection is optimised when using the power saving modes.\n\nOn top of these, there is a new option to Android for Work to avoid file transfers via the USB port, voice mail speed dialing and notifications within the Knox container, and enhancements to One Talk voice call performance in Power Saving Maximum mode.\n\nVerizon has not confirmed yet when to release the Blueborne fix for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.", "I've been a very happy 2 degrees customer for the past 2 years.\n\nI had an account with family share, sharing my data with my two kids. And all was happy.\n\nI just upgraded my phone to the s8 in June or july (can't remember exactly which J month) and at the time, they were running a promotion to upgrade the kids accounts for extra $5 a month to their own Freedom accounts. Which would mean no more data sharing yey. I made sure on the kids phones with family share, that they had data limits set up so no one was hogging data and that worked well for 2 years, no issues. Although sometimes son would use a bit more than I or his sister would have liked. But I only ever had to do a data addon in emergencies a few times. With him having his own Freedom account, I said, once you run out of data, that is it, you have to wait for it to renew on the 4th of the month. So if he uses it all on day one, he has to wait approx 30 days for more data.\n\nI am on a 2.5gb a month plan (was previously on $5gb plan when on familyshare) and now the kids are on their own 2.5gb plans - so 7.5gb per month of data - which is way more data than the past 2 years.\n\nFast forward a couple of months. This might be long, my apologies in advance. But it is to help you understand.\n\nI am out and about and get a text notification that I am out of data - I open up my browser and sure enough it loads the 2d page saying I am out of mobile data and need an addon pack. I found this weird as I had about 6gb of carryover data when I changed from family share, as I hardly use data and am almost always on my home wifi and work wifi and all my apps on my phone always only update on Wifi - and when I checked my mobile usage on my device it said I had only used 206mb from 4th sept (the start of my mobile data anniversay) to the current. I top up anyway as I needed to access my bank app to transfer money from my savings to buy food.\n\nWhen I got home, I discovered by logging into 2degress I had my 1gb topup and data of close to 2gb so immediately phoned 2 degrees to find out why I was forced to buy an addon pack as I had data. She said, yes I can see you had data and I don't know why - and she put me on hold to investigate. When she gets back to me she says there was a glitch on my account and apoligiese and reversed the addon top up and the charge...so they refunded me my $20 and took back the 1gb. I didnt' question my data usage at the time, as I didn't even know I had used as much as they are telling me my phone has used.....but\n\nThen a few days later, I am out of data again and I know I have not used what was left of my data.\n\nSo I do a bit of checking with the mobile data usage and I am using mobile data when I am at home and asleep in the middle of the night.\n\nNow just in case you want to ask, there are no mobile hot spots turned on on my phone. And my brand new expensive Asus modem (that I bought for parental controls) is functioning with no drop outs. I know it is not dropping out cuz if it did the kids would be on me about their games disconnecting and lag.\n\nSo this lead me to do more checking. Just to give you an understanding of my home network. I have parental controls turned on so during the week, at 11pm my son and my homestay mobile devices/computers shut off (weekends it is midnight). They are still connected to modem, but they get no internet traffic, it blocks it.\n\nMost times the mobile usage corresponds just after 11pm, when my son has to physically turn wifi off and switch to mobile data.\n\nI am blissfully sleeping with my phone that is still connected to wifi as my device is the only one with no parental controls. Occasionally (but very rarely) I am up late streaming to chromecast, which can only cast over wifi, not mobile data. But most of the times past 11pm, were work nights and I know I was asleep.\n\nSo knowing that my son has been using mobile data, I checked his mobile usage through the 2d website. He had no mobile data usage since Sept 18th, yet he has been using mobile data, as he was not using home wifi network.\n\nSo that leads me to believe, there is still a glitch on my account - somehow the 2d system is still family sharing to my sons number from my data pool (this was also the last number to be added to the new Freedom account) and connected on to my account as I am paying for my childrens accounts.\n\nMy s8 is telling me I have used this much mobile data the last 3 months. Which at the start of that period and with the account change, I had about 6gb of carryover data, plus each month 2.5gb of new data added to that.\n\n2d have said I have used 14gb of mobile data. Nope, no I haven't, but if my sons mobile number was still linked to my number somehow, then yes, yes we may have used that amount of data, but me personally, on my number I don't use that data. I have facebook, email and mobile banking I use when not on wifi and that does not use a lot of data and I have no changed my usage. I do not play mobile games on my phone or have any installed. I uninstalled them all before I upgraded my phone to make the process of upgrading quicker.\n\nMy sons stupid lil phone does not have great reporting like the samsung, but there are days he is using over 1gb streaming Youtube etc.\n\nMy account is set to renew on 4th Octover, and I have mobile data turned off on my device to see what is going to happen next month. I have requested 2d to investigate as I highly believe it is my sons device using all the data - who's data has he been using since the 18th? - mine! And as soon as mine ran out on the 22nd September, at the same time, he comes complaining there is no mobile data, yet, he has been using it since 18th (when his orginally ran out) to the 22nd - yet it is not showing on his data usage on 2d website with his telephone. No usage since the 18th when his ran out for his number.\n\nI hope this makes sense to someone as the Customer Service staff at 2d do not seem to understand. I've asked twice now for technical engineer to look into my account, surely they can get mac address or ip of devices using data each time (not sure if that was trackable on family share though as data usage was lumped into the one report, but I am not sure what 2d can see on their backend)", "Bail hearing for accused drug trafficker adjourned until October 24.\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\n\u200bA WARRNAMBOOL man with a history of trafficking ice has been remanded in custody for another month while it's determined if he can be booked into a Melbourne rehabilitation facility.\n\nShane Carlin, 24, of Lava Street, Warrnambool, applied for bail in the Warrnambool Magistrates Court on Thursday and the application was adjourned until October 24.\n\nMr Carlin is charged with 14 offences including trafficking ice and a number of charges of possessing illicit substances such as ice, cannabis, steroids, Viagra and prescription medication and well as possessing a weapon.\n\nHe was found with almost seven grams of ice with a potential street value of $5600.\n\nPolice alleged that at 12.10am on August 16 patrolling officers saw a silver Mazda heading north on Aberline Road, before it turned left into Whites Road.\n\nOfficers attempted to intercept the vehicle and it soon after pulled over in Carlyle Court.\n\nThe passenger in the vehicle was Mr Carlin and he was attempting to conceal something in his left hand.\n\nHe became angry and because he was agitated police officers placed him in handcuffs.\n\nA small metal tin containing 1.5 grams of cannabis was found in his front left pants pocket.\n\nIn his jacket was 12.29g of cannabis, just over one gram of crushed tablets believed to be prescription medication, a clear plastic bag containing 6.86g of ice, 20 small plastic bags, a Samsung mobile phone that had been reset and a mini iPad.\n\nThe female driver pointed out a white plastic bag in the passenger side footwell of the Mazda that contained a vile of steroids, another glass vile, almost two grams of cannabis, a round plastic container holding nine grams of cannabis and one tablet of prescription medication.\n\nAlso in the vehicle were two used ice pipes and other small amounts of cannabis and ice as well as a 30cm knife, also in the front passenger seat footwell.\n\nA further search at the police station located a tablet of Viagra in Mr Carlin's wallet.\n\nIn September last year Mr Carlin was jailed for five months for trafficking amphetamines and ecstasy and dealing with property suspected of being stolen.\n\nOn release he started a 15-month community corrections order which has been breached by the new charges.", "We're just six days away from Google announcing the second-generation Pixel lineup (along with some other expected products, including some new Google Home devices), and in the meantime we wanted to revisit the original Pixel and Pixel XL. Too often, tech sites including ourselves get caught up in the craze of new devices and neglect to look at how well (and sometimes, how poorly) the older devices have held up.\n\nThe Pixel and Pixel XL were some of our favorite phones when they launched last year, and though we've since seen dozens of great new devices, we're still terribly fond of Google's in-house projects, which have aged better than just about any other Android phones we've seen.\n\nAlthough the Pixel's hardware looks a bit dated in today's age of increasingly slim bezels, it's still a terrific phone with a sturdy build and one of my personal favorite fingerprints sensors. It's well-placed in a spot that your index finger naturally gravitates towards, large enough that you won't miss it (ahem Samsung), and the downward swiping gesture to access the notification panel is wonderfully convenient.\n\nThe Pixel also offers one of the cleanest Android experiences, with the latest version 8.0 \"Oreo\" in tow. Being a Google phone, there's no bloatware of course, and Oreo brings some new conveniences that even today's newest flagships don't offer. YouTube Red users can shrink videos into a floating window to continue watching while multitasking, and Google Maps offers a similar PIP view for turn-by-turn navigation.\n\nAndroid phones have a bad habit of quickly deteriorating in performance and battery life over time, but those issues are basically non-existent on the Pixel. Performance is still buttery smooth, matching the iPhone in speed and fluidity, and the 3450 mAh battery still offers all-day endurance.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known of the Pixel's strong points is its camera. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL take some of the best photos of any phone, despite not having a dual camera layout like most of this year's flagships. Scrolling through the #shotonpixel tag on Instagram reveals some stunning shots, and we can only assume an even better camera on the upcoming Pixel 2.\n\nThe Pixel isn't perfect; it isn't water resistant, there's no wireless charging, and the design is a bit tired by now, but we're hoping Google will address some of these shortcomings with the sequel next week. Until then, the original Pixel and Pixel XL are still some of the best phones on the market.", "Interbrand, the world's largest brand consultancy, has announced the Best Global Brands for 2017, stated a press release. Now in its 18th year, the theme of this year's Best Global Brands report is 'Growth in a Changing World', examining three key components: People, Technology and Brands. The combined value of the world's top brands, 1,871,730 USD, is an increase of 4.2% from the previous year, 42% of which is generated by the Top 10 brands.\n\nThe release stated that Interbrand has named Apple, Google, and Microsoft as the three most valuable brands in the world, with technology as the dominant sector. This year, the list also featured three new entrants: Ferrari at #88, Netflix at #78 and Salesforce.com, at #84.\n\n\"We live in one of the most exciting periods of change - societal, technological and industrial - that impacts every aspect of commerce and life,\" said Interbrand Global CEO Jez Frampton. \"In this ever-shifting context, growth is more challenging, which is why businesses need brands more than ever. The Best Global Brands understand that brands are the platform for growth.\"\n\nApple and Google have held the top positions for five consecutive years. Apple's brand value grew by 3% to 184,154 million USD, while Google's brand value grew by 6% to 141,703 million USD. Microsoft rose to #3, as one of sixteen brands with double-digit percent growth. Closely following Coca-Cola at #4 are Amazon, Samsung, Toyota, and Facebook, which broke into the Top 10 for the first-time at #8 (up from #15 last year). Mercedes-Benz and IBM round out the Top 10. Frampton said the most significant change in the list is the continued rise of technology-centric brands, especially among the Top 10.\n\nThe five Top Growing Brands include Facebook (48% growth) leading for the second year running, Amazon (29%), Adobe (19%), Adidas (17%), and Starbucks (16%).\n\nOver half of the Best Global Brands came from four sectors: Automotive (16), Technology (15), Financial Services (12), and Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (9). Retail is the top growing sector in percentage terms (19%), followed by Sporting Goods (10%), Technology (8%), Logistics (7%), and Financial Services (6%).\n\nCommenting on the 2017 Annual Report, Interbrand India Managing Director Ashish Mishra said, \"'Growth in a Changing World' is best exemplified by South Asian markets, which include one of the world's fastest growth markets and one that is undergoing maximum change. Our objective through Best Global Brands and the Best Sri Lankan Brands league table launching in November 2017 is to raise the bar for Sri Lankan brands through our global best practices. For example, Samsung, which entered the ranking in 2001, now ranked at #6, invested heavily in R&D to improve its product. It also developed a brand platform and architecture that laid the foundation for all marketing activities. This meant that they could shape perceptions in a coordinated and consistent manner, while increasing impact and operational efficiencies.\"\n\nMND CEO/Sri Lanka partner for Interbrand, Michel Nugawela said \"Interbrand's Best Sri Lankan Brands league table is modelled on Best Global Brands, so the world's gold standard in brand valuation methodology will be used for ranking. As well as providing a rigorously analyzed valuation number, Interbrand's methodology also brings together market, brand, competitor and financial data into a single, value-based framework, within which the performance of the brand can be assessed and improved, and the financial impact of investing in the brand quantified.\"", "After spending some time as an AT&T exclusive, the Galaxy S8 Active might soon make its way to another U.S. carrier.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Active will is coming to T-Mobile, according to marketing materials viewed by VentureBeat.

AT&T is selling the phone for $849.99.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S Active phones are normally AT&T-exclusive in the U.S., but it's possible that that might finally change this year. When AT&T announced the device, it said, \"For a limited time, the latest Galaxy S8 Active device will be exclusively available from AT&T,\" suggesting that the device will eventually make its way to another carrier.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 Active is a toughened version of the standard Galaxy S8, boasting a metal frame with corner bumpers as well as a textured back for added grip.

That's still more affordable than the latest iPhones, particularly the iPhone X, or Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 models.\n\nIf that's not enough, Google just launched a trade-in program to make the Pixel 2 seem more affordable, and it slashed the prices of the older models. But a new report says that Google might be working on a Pixel 2 offer so good that you won't be able to refuse.\n\nApparently, purchasing a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL will get you unlimited Google Cloud storage until 2023. That means you'd be able to store anything in Google's cloud for years, not just pictures.\n\nIf true, that would be huge, as it'd offer those people who use a lot of cloud storage some massive savings over the course of 5 years -- 2023 does sound pretty arbitrary.\n\nCurrently, each Google account comes with 15GB of free cloud storage. 100GB costs $1.99 per month, while 1TB of storage is priced at $9.99. Need more? $99.99 buys 10TB of storage per month -- what are you doing with all that data?\n\nThat said, we still have to wait for Google to confirm this wild claim, so don't get too excited. The Pixel 2 event is scheduled for October 4th.", "Apple has secured access to advanced microchip technology that will help it to compete better with Samsung.\n\nToshiba agreed yesterday to sell its memory chip business for 2 trillion yen ($17.8 billion) to a consortium led by Bain Capital, the American private equity firm, joined by several large technology companies including Apple and Dell who will provide about $3.7 billion in financing.\n\nFlash memory is used in smartphones to store apps and other information. It differs from most desk-based computer hard drives in that it contains no moving parts, so that data is less likely to be corrupted by bumps. Smartphone makers are increasingly using NAND flash memory, an advanced form of the technology.\n\nSamsung is the world leader in NAND flash memory chips, controlling...", "If you've been an iPhone user for a while, you've probably noticed that older phones tend to degrade over time. For many, this is just the natural cycle of consumer electronics. For others, however, it's the result of a long-standing conspiracy meant to get people to buy new devices when they don't need them.\n\nApple, these theorists contend, deliberately sabotages older devices via software updates to incentivize consumers to buy the latest iPhone. This phenomenon is known as planned obsolescence, and many believe that it's a sinister and malicious business strategy meant to keep a company's coffers full of customer cash.\n\nOf course, there's no arguing with the fact that older devices get slower over time -- and in many cases, eventually become obsolete. But is there any truth to the theory that it is an intentional decision?\n\nMany of these theorists point toward one \"Harvard study\" that, ostensibly, proves that Apple does indeed kill its older devices. Before we move on to what's actually happening, let's get this \"study\" out of the way.\n\nFirstly, it's not a Harvard study. It appears to be a casual experiment performed via Google Trends by a Harvard student named Laura Trucco -- and more than that, it doesn't prove that Apple is sabotaging its devices at all.\n\nThe only thing that the \"study\" proved is that worldwide searches for \"iPhone slow\" tend to spike whenever a new iPhone is launched. Of course, that's just a passing correlation and hardly concrete evidence of intentional sabotage. Furthermore, while the \"study\" states that there isn't a similar trend for Samsung Galaxy devices, this can be explained, too (though we'll get to that later).\n\nWhile benchmark testing sites like Geekbench and AnTuTu don't test for various operating systems, a variety of other sources have tested iOS 11 on older devices.\n\nYouTube channel EverythingApplePro performed a speed test comparing iOS 11 to iOS 10.3.3 on various iPhone models and found that -- in most cases -- iOS 11 did result in a nominal decrease in speed. Similarly, ARS Technica conducted benchmark testing on an iPhone 5s running iOS 11 and found similar results. There was a noticeable decrease in speed, though not significant.\n\nA slight speed hit doesn't exactly sound like \"sabotage,\" but older devices do get slower on newer and better software. So what's going on?\n\nApple, unlike Android, designs both its own hardware and its own software. Because of that, the company has a very specific target to design their software around. Apple obviously creates and optimizes a new version of iOS to work best with its latest and greatest devices. It wouldn't make any sense to do otherwise.\n\nWhile many older devices are supported by newer software, some devices do go obsolete. The iPhone 5, for example, is a 32-bit phone and incompatible with new 64-bit versions of iOS. But, again, Apple can't just keep iOS 32-bit in order to appease owners of older devices -- it would just become stagnant.\n\nThat's also the reason why \"slow phone\" Google searches don't spike for Samsung devices. Android isn't made by Samsung, and the release of new Android software often doesn't coincide with new Samsung hardware. Similarly, when developing a new version of Android, the OS's makers have to account for a broader range of devices than Apple does.\n\nApple is creating its software to keep up with its advancements in hardware -- and technology overall. That's hardly \"intentional sabotage\" of older devices, even if it does result in aging handsets becoming obsolete.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that newer versions of iOS (really, all operating systems), with their increased load of features and capabilities, require better processors and internal specifications to run properly. With the pace of technological advancement in our modern age, there's no wonder why older phones get slower as time goes on. The technology that manufacturers install in these devices gets old very quickly, since it doesn't take long for technology to improve.\n\nAging devices just can't keep up, even if they were the latest and greatest when they were released. That's just the cycle of technology -- particularly when it's advancing so rapidly.\n\nThat all being said, there's is some planned obsolescence going on. But it's a trend across the entire consumer industry, not just at Cupertino. And it has its roots hundreds of years ago. As an example, there's a lightbulb that's been on continuously for nearly 116 years. Contrast that to modern lightbulbs that last just a few years.\n\nBut as the BBC points out, planned obsolescence of consumer products allows for businesses to be sustainable. And it allows these companies to keep up with the tastes and desires of their customers. \"In this way, planned obsolescence serves as a reflection of a ravenous, consumer culture.\"\n\nWhile greedy industries of yesteryear may have come up with this business model, \"they were hardly alone in doing so.\" And the rapid pace of obsolescence in technology has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and allowed the industry to flourish and advance at a breakneck pace.\n\nIn short, Apple isn't intentionally sabotaging its older phones -- at least, no more than literally any other company is sabotaging their own products.", "BlackBerry Ltd. chief executive John Chen touted the company's progress in its strategic shift away from its legacy handset business after it reported record software and services revenue on Thursday, sending its shares up as much as 17%.\n\nThe Waterloo, Ont.-based company reported US$19 million in net income for its fiscal second quarter, a big swing from the loss reported during the comparable period last year.\n\nIts software and services revenue for the quarter ended Aug. 31 hit a high of $185 million, comprising roughly three-quarters of the total for the period.\n\nBlackBerry CEO John Chen said Thursday this metric, as well as the company's improved margins, is a reflection of \"our compete transformation to a software company.\"\n\n\"We made great progress in all our key growth initiatives... all of these accomplishments position us well for future growth,\" he told analysts on a conference call this morning.\n\nShares of BlackBerry in New York were up as much as 17.3% to US$10.83 in intraday trading.

That compared with a year-earlier loss of 71 cents per basic share, or US$372 million in total.\n\nMichael Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity based in Minneapolis, said the upside this quarter was \"more one-time in nature,\" helped by some non-recurring licensing items. Still, BlackBerry's latest results show it is making headway on its long-term goals, he added.\n\n\"The company's definitely making progress on longer-term objectives, and putting up another strong quarter relative to consensus easily explains why the stock's up,\" Walkley said Thursday.\n\nChen also upgraded BlackBerry's outlook for the fiscal year, which ends on February 28, 2018. The company expects revenue in the range of US$920-million to US$950-million for the full year, Chen said, above analyst consensus of US$919-million. Chen also reiterated the company's expectation that software and services revenue will grow in the range of 10% to 15% for the fiscal year. The company also expects to be profitable for the full fiscal year, he added.\n\nBlackBerry also announced Thursday that it signed a new licensing deal, the first for BlackBerry Secure, its mobile-security platform designed to help companies manage and secure a variety of connected devices.\n\nThe company said it signed a licensing deal with Yangzhou New Telecom Science and Technology Company Ltd., an electronics design firm based in Yangzhou and Beijing which develops and manufactures smartphones and connected devices. Under the agreement, NTD will develop devices that will be branded by manufacturers, carriers and local smartphone brands and marketed under BlackBerry Secure.\n\nThis deal comes days after BlackBerry QNX, its automotive division, announced a partnership agreement with U.K.-based Delphi Automotive PLC to provide the operating system for its autonomous driving system. Also on Sept. 20, BlackBerry said it entered a reselling partnership with Fleet Complete, a U.S. fleet-tracking solution company. Fleet Complete will integrate BlackBerry's Radar, its trailer and other container tracking solution, into its tracking product.\n\nGrowth in the latest quarter was helped by the higher software and services revenue, said BlackBerry's chief financial officer Steve Capelli, on a call with analysts. Much of that growth was driven by licensing, which has the highest margins, he added.\n\nChen said that expects licensing will continue to be a strong driver of growth in the second half of the fiscal year, but over time it will be an equal contributor alongside its enterprise software business.\n\n\"I don't see a limit to my ability to license both our software technology, our know-how, as well as our IP (intellectual property),\" Chen said during a call with reporters on Thursday.", "Toshiba said Thursday it had formally signed a deal to sell its memory chip business to a group led by U.S. investor Bain Capital for around $18 billion.\n\nThe sale to the consortium - which includes U.S. tech giants Apple and Dell as well as South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix - is seen as crucial to keeping the struggling Japanese conglomerate afloat.\n\nTHursday's signing caps a months-long saga that saw heated courtroom battles, rival bids and the near-delisting of one of Japan's best-known firms. The Japanese firm had already said last week it would sell the business to the Bain-led group and aims to complete the sale by March. Toshiba is the world's number-two chipmaker behind Samsung and the division's products are found in many smartphones and electronic gadgets.\n\nThe chip unit accounts for around a quarter of Toshiba's total annual revenue and is the crown jewel in a vast range of businesses ranging from home appliances to nuclear reactors. Toshiba narrowly averted a delisting this year, but it still faces the humiliating prospect of being yanked from Japan's premier stock exchange if the sale does not raise enough money.\n\nSelling the chip division is seen as key to Toshiba's survival, as it battles to recover from multi-billion-dollar losses at its US nuclear operation Westinghouse Electric.", "Korean industrial giant Samsung and its U.S. partner Pattern Energy will have to wait until Monday to find out if a temporary injunction banning blockades of wind turbine construction sites will become permanent.\n\nA temporary injunction was granted on Sept. 6 prohibiting anyone from blockading, obstructing or impeding access to the 100-megawatt North Kent Wind project in north Chatham-Kent.\n\nThe wind developer was before Ontario Superior Court Justice Kirk Munroe in a Chatham court on Thursday seeking a permanent injunction.\n\nWater Wells First has led protests that included blockading several turbine construction sites to prevent workers and equipment from entering. The group has been sounding the alarm that the vibration from driving piles into the Kettle Point black shale bedrock - known to be harmful to humans - is causing severe turbidity that clogs water well systems.\n\nJim Bunting, the lawyer representing North Kent Wind, provided details about several dates where access to turbine construction sites were blocked, including incidents of trespassing. There were also incidents of workers being yelled at and property, including a crane and truck, being vandalized, he added.\n\n\"The reality is that tensions remains high,\" Bunting said, adding there is concern that interference to constructing the wind farm project will continue.\n\nA primary argument in seeking the injunction is that in North Kent Wind's opinion the protest activities are causing \"irreparable harm\" to the multi-million-dollar project.\n\nJustice Munroe told Bunting that he needs to be convinced of the irreparable harm, considering Water Wells First spokesman Kevin Jakubec has made an offer to North Kent Wind consenting to not block access to turbine construction sites.\n\n\"Why is it necessary from an evidentiary point of view that the injunction continue?\" Munroe said.\n\n\"I'm not here to quash active opposition,\" the judge added.\n\nBunting said his client is not asking for that, but rather to have protection from interference to the construction of the project.\n\n\"People are allowed to protest and allowed to voice an opinion, but they can't do so through unlawful actions,\" he said.\n\nMark MacKew, the lawyer representing Jakubec, said his client has agreed to protest in a lawful manner that doesn't interfere with the wind project.\n\nHe noted Jakubec continues to have a \"deeply held opposition to this project,\" but recognizes North Kent Wind has the appropriate permits to construct the project.\n\n\"We are trying to open a dialogue here, hence the agreement (with North Kent Wind),\" MacKew said.\n\nJakubec, who is normally outspoken about this issue, told reporters he has been advised by his legal counsel to not make any comment until after Justice Munroe delivers his decision, which is expected to happen at 2 p.m. on Monday.\n\nMunroe told the court he has read the proposed agreement and has some concerns about ensuring there is clear language regarding the details pertaining to intimidation and harassment before he issues an order.", "The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 release date is less than two months away, and now we know the official launch date.

And while the invite doesn't specifically mention the new Pixel 2, that's exactly what we expect to see.\n\nRead: Pixel XL 2 Leaks Bring Rumors to Life\n\nWith the Galaxy Note 8, iPhone 8, and iPhone X all behind us, Google's upcoming Pixel phones are two more exciting options for potential buyers. This is Google's second attempt at a smartphone that can rival Samsung and Apple. We'll know more in just a few weeks.\n\nGoogle's teaser video above gives us a small idea of what to expect from the Pixel 2. Saying things like \"What's wrong with my phone's battery?\" or \"Why is my phone always out of storage?\". Then hinting at potential features by asking \"Why does my phone take so many blurry photos?\" \"Why doesn't my phone understand me?\" and \"Why can't my phone update itself?\".\n\nNext, Google essentially confirms that these questions are valid points. Stating that it's funny we should ask, because their solution is coming on October 4th. The new Pixel XL 2 will offer improved battery life, an excellent camera, automatic updates thanks to Android 8.1 Oreo, and the Google Assistant.\n\nRead: Google Pixel 2 vs Galaxy S8: What Buyers Need to Know\n\nIn recent months, countless leaks and rumors gave us a good idea of what to expect. Additionally, Google's LG-made Pixel XL 2 recently hit the FCC. One more hint that these new phones are coming soon. So what will Google deliver in October and what can you expect?\n\nOn October 4th Google will likely unveil two brand new smartphones. Following a similar design and approach as the original Pixel from October 2016. Here's everything we know so far. The first being the Pixel 2, made by HTC, features a familiar design with big bezels like the original Pixel. Basically an upgraded version of Google's first Pixel smartphone.\n\nHowever, it's the new and improved Pixel XL 2, made by LG, that has potential buyers excited. While the image above is just a fan-made render, it's based on trusted leaks. Suggesting Google will deliver a phone with a 6-inch edge-to-edge OLED display similar to the new iPhone X. That said, it won't have a big gap in the screen for the sensors. Instead, it will feature a more traditional rectangle display similar to the Galaxy Note 8 or LG V30.\n\nSo far we're hearing Google's Pixel XL 2 will have a curved Quad-HD OLED display, a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4-6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a single yet vastly improved 13MP rear camera. We also expect Android 8.1 Oreo to debut on the Pixel 2. Additionally, these phones are IP68 dust and water-resistant, but don't have a 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nEither way, we only have a few more weeks to wait before Google officially unveils the new Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2.

The process is demonstrated via the smartphone's screen.\n\nCreative agency Guns or Knives was responsible for the stunt, working with projection mapping expert Pauric Hackett of \"Make and Share\" on production.

But I hope the company will reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\"\n\nHe said he wants Apple to \"step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Pai has been pushing the case for activating FM chips in phones for some time - he was talking about it back in February - the statement today glosses over a whole range of issues with the FCC and Pai himself.\n\nFirst, while Pai continues his perpetual self-promotion (only I can fix this), the truth is that the FCC has been arguing for years that smartphone companies should turn on their FM chips. There have been Congressional hearings on the issue.\n\nTwo-and-a-half years ago there was a big push by the National Association of Broadcasters (the radio industry's lobbyists) to activate FM functionality - and an equally big push back by phone manufacturers and telcos.\n\nThe FCC actually has the power to force companies to turn on FM receivers - but the regulator has been wary about taking that approach, even though it insists on the inclusion of certain chips in things like TVs.\n\nFormer FCC chair Tom Wheeler told a Congressional hearing in 2015 that \"the issue may be resolving itself in the marketplace,\" in response to a range of companies - including manufacturers LG, HTC and Samsung, as well as telcos T\u2011Mobile, Sprint and AT&T - turning on their chips. The big hold-out is Apple - hence Pai's statement.\n\nWhy doesn't Pai simply propose and pass an FCC rule that requires the chip be turned on? Because he has sold himself as the hands-off regulator. Insisting that phone companies do something that they don't want to would clash with that approach.\n\nWhy is there an FM receiver in smartphones in the first place? It does not appear to be an FCC-mandated requirement but simple economics: the most commonly used radio chips in phones - eg, Qualcomm's and Broadcom's - include FM circuitry as standard. It would inconvenient to use a chip that doesn't feature the electronics so it's simply turned off. Plus, in many countries - mostly poorer and lower-bandwidth countries - the chips are used all the time by people to listen to the radio with their phone.\n\nWhat's the advantage to having an FM receiver turned on? You can receive FM stations for free, without using up any data, and using far less battery power than streaming services.\n\nWhy are some companies refusing to turn them on? Largely because they feel it may conflict with their business models: lower data usage or less use of paid-for music apps. Free radio or $9.99 a month for Apple Music?\n\nHowever, it may be a bit rich for Pai to call out Apple for not doing enough for public safety.\n\nJust this week, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called out the FCC - and by implication Pai - for not doing enough to learn from the recent storms and hurricanes.\n\n\"After Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, the FCC held hearings to address network recovery,\" she tweeted. \"Why won't agency do it for Harvey, Irma & Maria?\"\n\nShe also put out a statement [PDF] on the matter, noting an FCC report on the storms but arguing: \"Let's not kid ourselves, this is not enough. When these devastating hurricanes began to batter our coastlines, I called for a full Commission report on these storms. We need to know what worked, what didn't, and where we can improve our communications infrastructure.\n\n\"Once we know the facts, we need a full plan for fixing the communications vulnerabilities we are finding, including how to deal with the impact on 911 and the interactions between social media and emergency response.\"", "WATERLOO, Ont. -- BlackBerry Ltd. shares jumped as much as 13% in early morning trading after it said revenue from its software and services business hit a record in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Waterloo, Ont.-based company reported US$19 million in net income for its fiscal second quarter, a big swing from the loss reported during the comparable period last year.\n\nIts key software and services revenue for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 31 hit a high of $185 million, comprising roughly three-quarters of the total for the period.\n\nBlackBerry CEO John Chen says this metric, as well as the company's improved margins, is a reflection of \"our compete transformation to a software company.\"\n\n\"We made great progress in all our key growth initiatives... all of these accomplishments position us well for future growth,\" he told analysts on a conference call this morning.\n\nShares of BlackBerry in New York were up more than 12.5% to US$10.40 at around 10 a.m. The Waterloo, Ont.-based company's shares in Toronto were up as much as 13% to $13.03.\n\nBlackBerry has made a strategic shift to producing mainly software and services over the past few years as its smartphones lost market share to Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nThe company's profit in the latest quarter amounted to four cents per basic share, reported in U.S. currency.

T-Mobile is poised to stock the well-received Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. (Sprint did in fact carry an S5 Active doppelganger in 2014, but it was branded S5 Sport.)\n\nAccording to marketing material reviewed by VentureBeat, T-Mobile's S8 Active will, unsurprisingly, go by model number SM-G892T (AT&T's model has an \"A\" at the end: SM-G892A). It should be available in the same Meteor Gray and Titanium Gold found in AT&T's lineup, although retail release timing is not clear -- with nary a mention in the usual pre-release databases such as FCC and Bluetooth SIG, it may still be months away.\n\nThe first hint that the IP68-certified S8 Active -- with its 5.8-inch, 1,440 x 2,560 Super AMOLED display, Snapdragon 835 SoC, and beefy 4,000mAh battery -- would be more widely available came from several sightings of yet a third model number (SM-G892U) in several certification databases. The \"U\" signifies a universal model, which could suggest that the eventual release may be even wider than just the two U.S. GSM network operators.", "A new rumour alleges that Google will reportedly release a third, premium 'Ultra pixel' smartphone on October 4th.\n\nThe rumour, courtesy of Arun Maini, who runs the YouTube channel Mrwhosetheboss, shows images and video of the device from an unnamed source.\n\nThe images show a slide on a laptop that showcases a device along with the title 'Ultra pixel,' as well as another slide that reads: \"The future of Android is Fluid.\" Lastly, a third image showcases what appears to be a variety of navigation buttons.\n\nThis is almost certainly a hoax.\n\nThe first problem is the name, which features a lowercase 'p' for Pixel -- a brand name that is always capitalized. A lowercase 'p' would break form with that format, and is therefore unlikely.\n\nI think this is 100% bullshit. I could be wrong, but there you go. https://t.co/lLDFCAI4I1\n\n-- David Ruddock (@RDR0b11) September 28, 2017\n\nSimilarly 'UltraPixel' has also been the name for HTC's camera technology for many years, and giving a new device that name would cause confusion -- though now that Google bought part of HTC's phone making company, it could perhaps sway the company's branding away from using the word pixel.\n\nSecondly, though it was first reported that Google was working on three smartphones -- Walleye, Muskie and Taimen -- more recent reports indicate that Google cancelled its third device and decided to only release two smartphones this year.\n\nAdditionally, according to Maini, the Ultra pixel is to have a dual camera setup, different from the Pixel 2 XL, as well as a \"new kind of fingerprint scanner.\"\n\nMaini believes this means a fingerprint sensor is located under the display. This technology wasn't ready for the Note 8, however, and eminent chipset manufacturer Qualcomm says its solution won't be ready until the summer of 2018.\n\nThe Ultra pixel would also require an OLED display to be Daydream ready, and though Google made a $880 million bid to LG to secure that tech, the market for flexible edge-to-edge OLED displays is currently being dominated by Apple for its iPhone X, making it unlikely that Google could obtain enough from Samsung to produce a third device.\n\nThe Ultra pixel also seems to have some form of new navigation. Maini suggests that this may be a new form of gesture base swiping, instead of actual software keys, something similar to the iPhone X.

That's Bill Gates, the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft who is still listed as a Technology Advisor to the company. And he uses an Android phone. That's surely the strongest sign yet that Microsoft is dead in the water in terms of its mobile strategy.\n\nSince Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, Microsoft has done great things. The company culture is changing, Windows 10 is one of the best versions of Windows ever, and things are looking up. Except when it comes to smartphones, a market in which Microsoft has completely failed to shine.\n\nBill Gates Is an Android Fanboy\n\nWith that in mind it shouldn't come as too great a shock to learn that Bill Gates, who is, in many people's eyes, Mr. Microsoft, has switched to Android Why I Quit Windows Phone And Switched To Android Why I Quit Windows Phone And Switched To Android In 2010 I bought my first Windows Phone device, beginning a love affair with the slick user interface and writing endless posts and user guides, generally evangelising the platform.

Back in 2013, the Korean electronics behemoth showcased a bendable display prototype called Youm. Likely to be called Galaxy X, the foldable smartphone once again came into limelight when Samsung's mobile chief teased on the same day Apple unveiled iPhone X that Samsung was working on a bendable display smartphone. Now the foldable Galaxy X has been certified by a Korean regulator, which indicates that its launch is imminent.\n\nIs this the foldable Galaxy X?\n\nLetsGoDigital reports that a device with model number SM-G888N0 has received certification from the Korean National Radio Research Agency (NRRA), which is an arm of the Korea Communication Commission (KCC). The \"N0\" in the model number denotes that it is a Korean model. Other manufacturers such as LG Electronics and ZTE have also been working on smartphones with bendable displays for years.\n\nOn the certification page, the NRRA describes the device as a \"radio equipment for global LTE communication.\" The listing does not provide any specific information about the product, so it could be anything. But things don't stop there. A device with the same SM-G888N0 model number has been making appearances on a number of regulatory and authority sites.\n\nFor instance, when the same model number appeared on the WiFi Alliance, it was described as a \"smartphone.\" It indicates that the device is a smartphone or a smartphone/tablet hybrid of some kind. Back in July, the same device was granted Bluetooth certification by the Bluetooth SIG. At the time of both appearances, the rumor mill had associated the model number with the foldable Galaxy X.\n\nSamsung's patent drawings in the past have revealed that the Galaxy X would be an extra-widescreen device. The internal side of the foldable phone would be a flexible screen. It could be much wider than the Galaxy S8, which has an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. It would allow users to fold the device in a small clamshell format that easily fits into your pocket while still offering a large display.\n\nNot much is known about the Galaxy X, except that it will have a foldable screen. Samsung has been working on the new display technology for years under the code-name Project Valley. The rumor mill claims it will have a 5-inch screen with 4K resolution. Samsung doesn't yet offer the 4K resolution on its smartphones. SamMobile had reported last year that the Galaxy X display would have a \"diamond PenTile subpixel arrangement.\" You will be able to fold it in half, just like your wallet.\n\nWhen will it launch?\n\nThe NRRA certification suggests that the phone's launch is imminent. DJ Koh told media earlier this month that the foldable display smartphone would launch in 2018. However, he added that the new display technology was facing technical challenges that, if not resolved in time, could push back its arrival. Korean site ETNews claims the foldable Galaxy X would initially launch in limited quantities only in South Korea to assess consumer response.\n\nThe rumor mill claims Samsung could offer us a glimpse of the device at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018 in Las Vegas. The CES is not the most favorite place for smartphone vendors to unveil their devices. But Nokia had unveiled its first Android smartphones at the CES earlier this year, so there is always a possibility of Samsung unveiling the Galaxy X at the CES.\n\nThe timing of DJ Koh's recent comments indicates that the Galaxy X could be Samsung's response to Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone X. The iPhone X is Apple's biggest smartphone upgrade in years, and it is jam-packed with innovative new technologies. Samsung is already planning to launch the Galaxy S9 earlier than usual (in January rather than in February-March) to defend its market share against the iPhone X. The Galaxy X launch could prove that Samsung remains at the forefront when it comes to innovation in display technologies.\n\nTags: Galaxy X Samsung", "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has a message for Apple CEO Tim Cook: \"Flip the switch\" and turn on FM radios embedded in iPhones.\n\nIn the wake of three major hurricanes that have wiped out communications for millions of people over the past month, Pai issued a statement Thursday urging Apple, one of the largest makers of cellphones in the U.S., to \"reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\" FM radios that are already included in every phone could be used to access \"life-saving information\" during disasters, he said.\n\nFor years, the majority of smartphones sold in the U.S. have included FM radios, but most of them have been turned off so that you couldn't use the function. Why? Mobile customers would be a lot less likely to subscribe to streaming music services if they could just listen to traditional, free broadcast radio. This incentive is especially true for Apple, which has a streaming music service.\n\nIn recent years, phone manufacturers have begun to turn on the feature. Today, several makers like Samsung, HTC, Motorola and LG have FM capability working, including on some of their most popular devices, like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Moto G5 Plus. But Apple continues to hold out.\n\n\"Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so,\" Pai said.\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple is one of the last phone manufacturers to turn on FM radios in its popular iPhones.\n\nBroadcast signals are often the most resilient and reliable form of communication during and after a disaster. While cellphone infrastructure is often knocked out in the wake of a big storm, broadcast signals, which use low frequencies and can travel much further distances and penetrate through obstacles, usually remain up. Radio broadcasts are often the best way to get critical information to the public during a disaster.\n\nPai's statement comes as some lawmakers have also begun to put pressure on Apple to turn on its FM radios. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida is leading the charge. While touring the damage, Nelson told a local TV station in Fort Myers that he was considering writing phone manufacturers.\n\nThe National Association of Broadcasters, which represents radio station owners, has for years lobbied lawmakers and the wireless industry on this issue. The group said Thursday it's encouraged by Pai's support and it's joining him and Nelson in urging Apple to acknowledge the public safety benefits of activating its FM radios in iPhones.\n\n\"Local broadcasters are a lifeline information source in times of crisis, as Chairman Pai, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and other members of Congress and the FCC have noted,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nPai, a Republican, has been reluctant to mandate cellphone makers offer FM radio access. Instead, he's hoping to appeal to Apple's sense of duty to promote public safety.\n\n\"I am asking Apple to activate the FM chips that are in its iPhones,\" Pai said. \"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first.\"", "Sony is believed to be only working on premium and mid-range flagship phones. We know the mobile business for the company isn't exactly doing well like Samsung, LG, or those top Chinese OEMs but Sony still has a loyal market. We've seen the Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact recently and we're just waiting for Android Oreo updates to roll out for some Xperia models.\n\nWe're also looking forward to the next flagship phone especially since we just heard Sony will introduced an all-new design. This idea is according to Sony India managing director Kenichiro Hibi who said the next Android smartphones from the company will be different.\n\nWe're not exactly sure how they will look but they will feature \"an omnibalance design\". A new generation of products can be expected according to the executive so we'll look forward to future announcements.\n\nWe're assuming those mobile phones will have almost bezel-less displays with 18:9 aspect ratio or something really close. Sony definitely needs to keep up with the competition if it wants to stay in the game. Focusing on the premium category may be ideal but the mid-range market may bring in more money for the company. Let's wait and see what improvements Sony will bring.", "The Alcatel Idol 5 is a $200 Android phone with a premium design carved from metal and curved glass. It has a few unique features like a reversible display and a theme creator that uses the colors the camera sees. It also has a few extras like stereo speakers, USB-C, and NFC. It's also designed to work with a new VR headset from Alcatel. We check it out in person and share our impressions in this hands-on.\n\nThe design of the Alcatel Idol 5 is both refined and distinct. It has a solid metal body that feels premium and refined. The glass on the front has a large curve at the sides, something usually only found on higher-end phones. Shiny chamfers give the phone a bit of sparkle.\n\nA lot of phones these days have metal and curved-edge glass, and even chamfers, but the way everything is put together on the Idol 5 is really just about perfect. This feels like a much more expensive phone. The way the drilled speakers peek out from under the front glass at the top and bottom is an attractive and unique design touch that gives the phone some character.\n\nThe phone is a good size and weight. The curved shape of the back helps the phone feel very thin.\n\nThe build quality is excellent. The phone feels 100% solid, yet very comfortable. The matte texture of the metal feels wonderful. The plastic antenna lines feel completely seamless.\n\nAlcatel Idol 5\n\nThe lock and volume buttons are thin, but work well. The round \"Now key\" (shortcut button) on the side -- which can be customized to perform different actions -- is difficult to press, but at least that means you won't press it by accident and activate VR mode or the camera while the phone's in your pocket.\n\nThe display is decent, offering full-HD resolution at a 5.2-inch size. Brightness and viewing angles are fine -- but not great -- for an LCD screen these days. Like previous Idol phones, the whole phone is reversible, meaning if you pick it up upside-down, the screen will flip -- along with the active speaker and microphone -- so you won't even notice.\n\nUSB-C with fast charging is appreciated, as is the 3.5mm audio jack. The stereo speakers have a dedicated amp for extra oomph and face forward. The main camera clocks in at 12 megapixels and the front is 8. I'm glad to see NFC (supporting Android Pay) -- that's not a given at this price -- but it's a shame there's no fingerprint reader.\n\nThe processor is a MediaTek P20, which uses an advanced 16nm FinFET process, meaning it should deliver excellent efficiency. There's only 2 GB of RAM; I'd love to see 3 GB, but 2 GB is expected at this price point right now.\n\nThe software is very standard Android in many ways, such as the basic functionality, notification shade, and settings. The important tweaks are a few extra shortcuts on the lock screen, a special theme creator, and an advanced camera app.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe extra shortcuts on the lock screen -- there are five total -- let you jump right into recording a voice memo or activating the flashlight, for example. You can also assign any of these actions to the dedicated \"Now key\" on the right, for even faster access. I might make it a camera key, but you could make it a new-email key or a Snapchat key.\n\nThe Color Catcher app lets you create your own theme for the whole interface by simply aiming the camera at the colors you want to use. You can use the colors in your favorite room or artwork, something from a magazine that catches your eye, or even the outfit that you have on that day. It's very easy to use and works well. This is a really fun feature. Although since it re-colors all of your app icons, you might get lost trying to find your favorite apps after you change the theme.\n\nThe camera app is where Alcatel has put the most effort. It resembles the camera software of a much higher-end phone.\n\nCrucially, it's very easy to use. The main viewfinder is copied from Apple's camera app. (Although everyone else copies it now, too. That's just how camera apps look now, I guess.) Everything else is in the Modes screen, which has a very nice menu of modes, plus an option to customize that screen, and nice big button for the rest of the settings.\n\nThe selection of modes is excellent, including standards like panorama, manual, and slow-motion, but also options like 360 Photo, Instant Collage, and Light Trace.\n\nIt also has Cinemagraph mode, which lets you create short videos with motion limited to just one area, which limits the file size so they're easy to share. It will intelligently highlight an area of motion, but you can customize it for perfect results, or get creative for more fun results. It works well and is fun to use.\n\nMy only gripe with the camera app is that parts of it -- the Modes screen in particular -- only work on portrait orientation. Having to rotate the phone to pick a mode is annoying.\n\nFinally, there's the VR functions. The Idol 5 is designed to work with Alcatel's new UNI 360 VR goggles. They're nicer than good Google Cardboard goggles, but a step below Samsung's Gear 360 or Google Daydream.\n\nThe setup is Cardboard-compatible, but it's Cardboard on steroids. It has two buttons instead of one and is cleverly adjustable to fit a wide range of phones.\n\nIf you're using an Idol 5 or 5S, you can run Cardboard apps through Alcatel's special VR Home app instead of the Cardboard app. Alcatel's app adds two very neat functions: Live Notifications and Pass-Through Camera. Live Notifications lets you see incoming messages, notifications, and incoming calls right in the VR environment, and even answer calls. Pass-Through is a kind of mixed-reality mode that lets you see the room around you using the camera, so you don't have to remove the goggles to see what's going on around you.\n\nI tried the UNI 360 with the Idol 5, and mostly liked the combo... at least at this price point.\n\nThe Idol 5 is a bit underpowered for smooth motion; there's a reason Google Daydream requires a high-end processor. But I got over the jerky frame rate quickly. The same is true for the low screen resolution; Full HD is great for normal viewing, but VR goggles are like a microscope; you'll be staring at huge, obvious pixels with this screen. And the square shape of the pixels on this LCD panel makes them even more obvious. But after a few seconds, you'll probably stop noticing. VR content content can be very engaging that way.\n\nThese issues should go away if you use the UNI 360 with a higher-end phone. Unfortunately, you can only use the VR Home app on an Idol 5 or 5S at the moment. Even with the Idol 5, this combo is not a terrible VR experience for the price.\n\nCrucially, the UNI 360 didn't screw with my eyes too much. Most Cardboard goggles force my eyes to focus at the wrong distance, making my eyes hurt and making me feel blind for a minute after I'm done. I didn't have that problem with the UNI 360.\n\nAll in all, the Alcatel Idol 5 has a truly premium design that punches above its weight, and a variety of thoughtful and well-executed features that add a lot of fun. It seems like a good value for $200. We look forward to doing a full review.\n\nThe UNI 360 VR goggles will sell separately for $50. They're designed to work with any phone with a screen between 5 and 6 inches.", "You may have already seen Engadget posting reviews from our friends at The Wirecutter. Now, from time to time, we'll also be publishing their recommended deals on some of their top picks.

At $269, while this is only about $20 off the street price for the Zenpad 3S 10, we haven't seen it lower.

The ZenPad 3S 10 costs less than $300 and has enough power to run apps in split-screen mode, a feature of its recent upgrade to Android 7.0. The ZenPad has the same screen size and resolution (2048\u00d71536) as the 5th-generation iPad, and a similarly durable metal frame, but it's even thinner and lighter.\"\n\nA great deal on our top retractable dog leash pick, the Flexi New Neon Retractable Tape Dog Leash.

Shipping is free with Prime.\n\nThe Flexi New Neon Retractable Tape Dog Leash is our top pick in our guide to the best retractable dog leash. Audrey Pavia writes, \"After interviewing veterinarians and professional dog walkers, plus looking into more than 60 models and testing six of them, we think the Flexi New Neon Retractable Tape Dog Leash is the best retractable dog leash for most dogs and their owners. It is built sturdily out of bright, reflective material, is affordable, and comes from a company serious about pet and user safety (and that developed the retractable leash in the first place). But before you buy a retractable leash, be sure you actually need one.\"\n\nAn excellent drop, matching the lowest price we've seen, on our top portable air conditioner pick. The Whynter Elite ARC-122DHP is usually well above $400 and hasn't seen a price this low since a drop in the spring that was followed shortly thereafter by a shortage of stock. As it seems there's still plenty of warm weather left in many places, it's a great time to pick one up for now or next summer. Shipping is free, but looks to be a touch on the slow side with an estimated 5-7 day wait.\n\nThe Whynter Elite ARC-122DHP is our top pick in our guide to the best portable air conditioner. Liam McCabe and Tyler Wells Lynch wrote, \"After putting in 45 hours of research, comparing more than 100 portable air conditioners and testing seven of the best models, we recommend the Whynter Elite ARC-122DHP. We think this dual-hose unit will cool a room faster than other portable ACs, using the least energy, even in extreme heat. It's significantly smaller and lighter than its closest competitors, and it has a typical noise level, installation kit, and price. It also has a built-in heater and a drain pump.\"\n\nIf you're in the market for a fast, reliable drive with more storage than typical portable drives offer, this is a good price on the Seagate Backup Plus Portable 5 TB drive. As the street price regularly sits between $140 and $150, this is a nice chance to pick one up.

The language used in the carrier's press release states that it will be the sole provider of the phone \"at launch\", which like the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active, means it will likely make its way to more carriers (and more regions) eventually.\n\nCarrier exclusivity deals aside, this is a heck of a bargain for what is building up to be one of 2017's best flagships. Sprint is taking full advantage of the spotlight by offering a buy-one-get-one for the V30 Plus, with both phones costing just $38 per month combined. That works out to roughly $900 for two phones, which is a staggeringly good deal considering that other carriers, like T-Mobile, are offering a single V30 (non-Plus) for $30 per month, or about $800 total after a two-year contract.\n\nNot just that, Sprint is also offering a free Google Daydream View headset and a content starter pack along with purchase. The deal just gets better and better.\n\nGreat deal, confusing phone\n\nDigging into what makes the V30 Plus unique, it isn't a \"plus\" in the same sense as, say, the iPhone 8 Plus. It's actually no bigger than the standard LG V30, which also features a six-inch AMOLED display.\n\nWhat is different is the internal storage, which is doubled to 128GB, as well as the fact that LG is tossing in a set of its LG Quad Play wired headphones that are supposedly suited to take advantage of the Quad DAC built into the phone.\n\nAs the release of the LG V30 has crept closer with few details shared until recently, the announcement of an entirely separate model is somewhat confusing. This is compounded further by the fact that the Plus is not only the exact same size as the core V30, but also that the doubled storage doesn't carry much weight as a selling point since both versions have a microSD slot.\n\nI suppose the Plus-specific earbuds are a solid toss-in, assuming these are as good as the Bang & Olufsen earbuds that LG included with last year's LG V20. But what does this mean for what's inside of the standard V30's box? We haven't received a final unit yet, so we're unsure of what buyers are in for when they buy in.\n\nThe LG V30 Plus comes after Sprint nabbed exclusive rights to sell the Essential Phone in its stores. Given that Sprint is the underdog of US wireless carriers, it's definitely an impressive feat to nab not one, but two big hardware exclusives.\n\nVia Engadget", "A couple of reports from Taiwan and Japan bring bad news about the iPhone 8. Apparently, at least two iPhone 8 Plus shipped with damaged batteries that ended up causing the devices to crack open.\n\nBefore you ask, no, the batteries did not explode. But they did swell up, which is a safety mechanism meant to prevent actual battery explosions and fires.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the battery to swell up, and accidents do happen with any device powered by a battery, iPhones included. The fact it just happened to brand new iPhone 8 units is obviously a red flag for Apple, which will investigate the incidents.\n\nImage Source: iFeng\n\nAccording to cnBeta, a Taiwanese woman who just purchased a 64GB iPhone 8 Plus charged the device using the original cable and adaptor. After three minutes, she saw the front panel bulge up. Apple is reportedly now in possession of the device for analysis.\n\nImage Source: iFeng\n\nA similar case was reported in Japan, where a buyer says the iPhone 8 Plus was shipped with the screen detached:\n\nThe only thing inside a smartphone that can push out the display in such a manner is the battery. And the display is the most likely component to be affected by a battery that swells up.\n\nIt appears the battery inside the iPhone 8 Plus is made by Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), The Next Web says, citing unconfirmed reports. ATL was one of the two suppliers of faulty Galaxy Note 7 batteries that Samsung threw under the bus in early 2017. However, that shouldn't be a cause for concern, as long as these are isolated incidents. After all, the Galaxy Note 7 explosions were caused by Samsung's faulty design, not the companies building the batteries.", "Samsung has discounted the Galaxy J5 Prime and Galaxy J7 Prime about a year after launching the two in India. Mumbai-based retailer Mahesh Telecom publicized the price drop via its Twitter handle and the brand itself has switched to the new rates on its website.\n\nTo recall, the 16GB Galaxy J5 Prime and Galaxy J7 Prime came out in September last year at Rs 14790 and Rs 18790, respectively. Samsung later launched an updated version of these smartphones that packed 32GB of storage at Rs 14990 and Rs 16990, correspondingly. These particular variants are the ones that have gotten a cut.\n\nThe 32GB Galaxy J5 Prime now sells for Rs 12990 (Rs 2000 lower) and the 32GB Galaxy J7 Prime for Rs 14900 (Rs 2090 lower).

Samsung committed to the same specification for its flagship Galaxy smartphones; in all, about 90 smartphone models use Qi today, making it the industry's most popular among three standards. In addition to desktop charging stations (typically in the form of small charging pads), the automotive marketplace has also adopted in-cabin wireless charging.\n\nNearly 80 car models, from Audi, Chevrolet and KIA to Hyundai, Nissan and BMW, offer in-cabin wireless charging based on the electromagnetic Qi charging specification.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 public Qi charging locations worldwide, according to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the entity in charge of the Qi standard.\n\nMajor brands like McDonald's, Marriott, Ibis and others have built Qi into their properties. Airports, such as London Heathrow, Philadelphia and others around the world, have Qi charging stations. And businesses like Facebook, Google, Deloitte, PwC and Cisco have built Qi into their corporate offices.\n\n\"Over the last few years, one of the major delays for [manufacturers] wanting to introduce wireless charging solutions, particularly in the automotive in-cabin market, is the wait to discover which standard Apple may choose for any wireless-charging-enabled iPhone,\" said Vicky Yussuff, IHS lead analyst for wireless power. \"Now that Apple has decided to use the Qi standard, transmitter shipments into the in-cabin market will likely surge.\"\n\nAlong with third-party wireless charging manufacturers, Apple also plans to release its own AirPower wireless charging station designed to charge up to three Apple products at once, including the iPhone devices, Apple Watch and Apple AirPods through the charging case.\n\nThe number of devices enabled with wireless charging exceeded 200 million units a year for the first time in 2016, according to the latest IHS Markit forecast. Driven by shipments in mobile phones and wearables, that represented a 40% increase over 2015 levels as more consumers experience wireless charging for the first time.\n\nThe 2016 IHS Markit consumer survey showed that one in four people has now used wireless charging, and more than 98% of those would choose the feature again on their next phone. Both consumer demand for the feature and the volume of enabled devices are growing each year.\n\n\"Samsung's success with implementing wireless charging over the last two years coupled with Apple's iPhone announcement this week demonstrates that wireless charging technology is clearly achieving mainstream adoption in the mobile phone market, and the scope of its application is expected to quickly follow suit in other applications,\" Yussuff stated in a recent industry report.\n\nFor several years, restaurants, coffee shops and airports have been piloting the use of wireless charging for customer convenience.\n\nWith wireless charging adoption becoming widespread, the impulse for many users will be to just plop their smartphones down on the charging pad where it will remain fully charged all day long.\n\nIs it bad to fully charge your smartphone?\n\nWith greater ease of charging via wireless technology, the question becomes: Is it bad for your mobile device battery to be fully charged all the time?\n\nVenkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS), said that while you cannot overcharge a smartphone or tablet battery, as the electronics will not allow it, keeping it fully charged will hasten its degradation.\n\n\"Frankly, the higher you are in the [charge] state, as you creep up to 90%, 95% to 100% charge, the more degradation the battery will see,\" he said.\n\nAs a lithium-ion battery charges and discharges, ions pass back and forth between a positive electrode (made of lithium-cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate) and a negative electrode (made of carbon graphite).\n\nAs a battery charges, the positive electrode gives off lithium ions that move to the negative electrode and are stored as energy. As the battery discharges, those ions move back to the positive electrode to be used as electricity. As those lithium ions move back and forth, the electrolyte that acts as the transport medium degrades over time.\n\nThe higher the state of charge, the faster the electrolyte degrades, Srinivasan said.\n\nTherefore, it's best not only to keep your smartphone below its top charge, but also to keep the charging and discharging pendulum from swinging wildly.\n\n\"In general, if you swing the battery charge from top to bottom, that's the worst thing you can to for the life of the battery. If you can cycle the battery between 45% and 55% that's the best thing you can do,\" Srinivasan said. \"But, in general, just make sure you don't keep it fully charged.\"\n\nSrinivasan also cautions against being too sensitive to your smartphone or tablet charging. Most smartphone manufacturers design batteries to last two to three years, so if you're a consumer who typically replaces your phone after that amount of time, you don't need to be overly concerned with charging rates.\n\nAs more lithium-ion batteries hit the market, in both consumer electronics and electric vehicles, the rhetoric over whether you should keep those batteries fully charged has heated up, Srinivasan said. His blog posts often receive long comment threads from both sides of the spectrum.\n\n\"The debate between degradation due to high voltage hold vs. degradation due to over-cycling/over-discharge is a hot one,\" Daniel Steingart, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, stated in a recent blog post.\n\nLeaving your smartphone or tablet fully charged will speed the degradation of the battery, he said. But, he added, it's not that simple.\n\nThe damage of fully charging your battery has lessened over time with more sophisticated mobile battery management systems and incremental improvements in the battery cell technology itself, he said. For example, in 2007, when Steingart was a graduate student, taking a battery cell repeatedly to 4.2 volts meant \"an early death\" for it. he said. Today, the same damage to modern battery cells would require at least 4.4 volts.\n\nEven though battery cell technology has improved, there are still too many industry variables to know definitively whether one battery will show greater endurance than another based on continuous charging.\n\n\"We simply don't know, without a complicated tear-down and reverse engineering of the battery and battery management system, what the actual state of charge when the phone says '100%' is,\" Steingart said. \"Some apps give voltage indication, yes, but without knowing the specific formulation and composition of the cathode, we don't know exactly.\"\n\nBMS systems stop a smartphone or tablet from continually charging through the use of a sophisticated algorithm that balances how long the phone will last today vs. how long the battery will last, according to Steingart. If not for BMS technology, constantly charging your phone would kill the battery after a few months, he said.\n\nSteingart argued that the convenience of having a fully charged phone outweighs the risk of long-term battery damage. \"It's generally pretty straightforward to change a battery in a phone or have someone do it for you for [about] $20,\" he said. \"An extra $20 for a few years of convenience? Sign me up.\"\n\nApple charges a bit more for a battery replacement; regardless of the model you own, it's $79. If you have an AppleCare extended warranty, then it's free.\n\n\"Yes, a cell phone is an investment,\" Steingart said, \"but relative to the incremental cost of a new battery, there are much, much more important things to worry about in the world.\"", "OTTAWA, Sept. 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Quarterhill Inc.

Avoid using your money to buy trouble for yourself. Some of these so-called 'London Used Phones' might actually be stolen phones.\n\n\"If there are no buyers, there would be low demand for stolen phones and robbers would cease to be interested in other peoples' phones\".\n\nGoing further, the RRS narrated the story of Adebayo for other Nigerians to learn from his story.\n\nThe RRS wrote: \"Jamiu Adebayo, 30 was arrested in Lagos state last week by the operatives of Rapid Response Squad for buying phones from armed robbers and 'one chance' gangs and repackaging them as 'London Used Phones'.\n\n\"Adebayo was tracked and found in possession of an iphone 7 belonging to one Kolade Johnson, a banker working in Lagos Island.\n\n\"Johnson, had on August 23 boarded a 'one chance' commercial bus around 5:45 a.m. on his way to work. The robbers, operating with the commercial bus dispossessed him of a laptop and 2 phones, one of which was traced to Adebayo while trying to sell it to a customer in Lagos Island as a 'London used phone'.\n\nREAD ALSO:Nnamdi Kanu is not in our custody - Army\n\n\"Also found in the possession of Adebayo were 6 additional iphones, 4 assorted phones and three MTN SIM packs, which he stated he collected from some of the robbers.\n\n\"The suspect in his confession to the police stated that he regularly bought stolen phones from three people who he is aware are members of an armed robbery and 'one chance' gang.\n\n\"Uche, Alubi and Pinheiro are three major guys I collect these phones from. Five out of the 11 phones traced to me were bought from Uche.\n\n\"If I tell you that I don't know these phones are stolen phones and that some of those I get the phones from are robbers, I would be lying to you. I know some of these phones were forcefully collected from people', he explained.\n\n'I buy iphone 7 with icloud at N45,000 and sell for N55,000. Those without icloud, I buy at N150,000 and sell for N180,000. I buy iphone 6 at N65,000. I buy Samsung phones at N22,000 and sell for N27,000. I sell other phones too. I work on the phones and disguise them as London used phones.\n\n\"Adebayo also confessed that he works with a phone technician to unlock iphones with active icloud. 'what we do is talk the owner to unlock it'.\n\n\"Our source disclosed that Uche, Pinheiro and Aluba have been on the run since the arrest of Adebayo last week Tuesday,\" the police said.\n\nMeanwhile, NAIJ.com had reported that the Zamfara state police command on Wednesday, September 27, intercepted two vehicles carrying arms in different parts of the state.\n\nPAY ATTENTION: Install our latest app for Android, read best news on Nigeria's #1 news app\n\nThe spokesman of the command, Muhammad Shehu, confirmed the development to journalists in Gusau.\n\nHe told newsmen that items recovered from the vehicles were three AK47 riffles, an automatic pistol, locally-made pistol, magazines and live ammunitions.", "The Gear Fit 2 Pro is advertised as iPhone compatible -- but the app to make it so hasn't been approved by Apple yet.\n\nWhen it was announced in August, the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro fitness tracker was touted as being compatible with Android phones and iPhones.

In a statement, Samsung said, \"We look forward to iOS support for Gear Fit 2 Pro pending approval in the App Store.\"\n\nApple did not respond to our request to comment on the app's status in its store.\n\nSamsung added iOS compatibility to its earlier Gear smartwatches in January 2017, after first pledging to do so almost exactly 12 months earlier.

According to a Samsung Members community admin, the company is also working on a major update for the Galaxy S7.\n\nIn a widely shared post on the Samsung community forums, an admin claims the Galaxy S7 will get the Samsung Experience UI (formerly known as TouchWiz) in the future. The admin says the UI will be available in the \"next update\" for the Galaxy S7.\n\nWhile the admin doesn't explicitly say \"Android Oreo\" it's safe to assume that Samsung and its carrier partners won't roll the UI out in a bug fix update.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge both started on Android Marshmallow with TouchWiz before Samsung rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat and a newer version of Samsung's UI. So while these comments don't serve as an official confirmation, they do make a lot of sense.\n\nThe admin also says Samsung plans to bring the Bixby voice assistant to more devices down the road though it's unclear if Android Oreo will be the upgrade that delivers it to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nSamsung hasn't confirmed Galaxy S7 Android Oreo updates but Galaxy S7-branded devices will almost certainly will get the bump from Android Nougat.\n\nThe company typically provides Galaxy devices with two major operating systems and Android Nougat was the first major release for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nAnd while the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will probably be first in line for Android Oreo, we expect the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Galaxy S7 Active to follow closely behind.\n\nIt's also expected to upgrade the Galaxy A7 (2017), Galaxy A5 (2017), Galaxy A3 (2017), Galaxy J7 (2017), Galaxy J5 (2017), Galaxy Note 7 FE, and Galaxy Tab S3 with Android 8.0 Oreo.\n\nOlder devices, like the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6, could miss out on Android Oreo now that they've reached the two year mark. Devices older than two years might not get Android Oreo but Samsung and its partners should continue to support them with bug fixes and security patches for the foreseeable future.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Intellectual property licensor Tessera Technologies Inc. said it initiated legal proceedings against South Korea's Samsung Electronics, alleging infringement of 24 patents covering a range of semiconductor processing, bonding and packaging technologies as well as imaging technologies.\n\nTessera, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xperi Corp., said it filed the complaints in multiple venues, including the U.S. International Trade Commission, three U.S. federal district courts and some international jurisdictions. Tessera maintains that Samsung infringes on the 24 patents in its semiconductors as Galaxy S6, S7, S8, and Note 8 smartphones, as well as other products.\n\nTessera derives its revenue from licensing its technology for semiconductor packaging and image analysis to tech firms. The company is considered \"a patent troll\" by some in the industry.\n\nJohn Kirchner, Tessera's CEO, said in a statement that Samsung has been a Tessera customer since 1997, but that its most recent license agreement expired in December 2016. \"We believe it is continuing to use our patented technologies without authorization, and without paying us fair compensation,\" Kirchner said.\n\nKirchner said Tesera has been in talks with Samsung on the issues but that it felt like it had \"no choice\" but to initiate legal proceedings.\n\nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "Now that the Galaxy Note 8 is officially available and everything seems to be performing well so far, Samsung has set its sights on a few projects. The first project is the Android Oreo update for the Galaxy S8 lineup, while the second project is 2019's flagship lineup with the Galaxy S9.\n\nThe folks at SamMobile have discovered two brand new firmware builds which have confirmed Samsung's progress on the project, while also likely confirming the build numbers for the Galaxy S9 lineup. As for those firmware build numbers, the first is G960FXXU0AQI5, while the secondary build number is G965FXXU0AQI5.\n\nFrom the build numbers, it has been deduced that the standard Galaxy S9 will have a model number of \"SM-G960\", while the Galaxy S9 Plus will have a model number of \"SM-G955\". There's nothing super exciting here, but at least we know that firmware development is underway, and hardware development shouldn't be too far behind, if it's not already underway.\n\nIt's still really early, so we'll definitely be seeing a slew of different leaks and rumors and bogus information between now and the Galaxy S9 launch.

Well, we have you covered with some of the great hits which were released in 2007... 10 YEARS AGO!\n\nIt was the year the iPhone was announced, J.K Rowling completed the final Harry Potter book and the year Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning UK monarch.\n\nThese songs are turning a decade old this year and we've found 14 gems which will take you back to a simpler time, before Justin Bieber.\n\nFor the entire time this song was at number one in the UK, it rained. But it was okay, because Rihanna's catchy lyrics reminded you to pick up your umbrella before you left the house.\n\nThe song fused R&B with a rocky undertone and really appealed to everyone at the time and you probably still remember all the lyrics to the song too.\n\nFergie - Glamorous ft. Ludacris\n\nYes! 10 years ago we all learned how to spell 'glamorous' correctly thanks to some help from Fergie... and now we can't spell it without singing the tune to this song either.\n\nIf you were 15 and enjoying your summer holiday from school, this song was probably blasting from your Sony Ericsson W810i, CyberShot or whatever amazing 'brick' phone you had.\n\nThe dance, which featured heavily in the video to this song, was almost as popular as the single itself. Everyone had a go at trying to do the dance, some failed, some pulled it off.\n\nMy Chemical Romance - Teenagers\n\nA teenager with a love for rock music? Then this song was definitely the anthem to your year!\n\nMy Chemical Romance released, arguably, their most successful album with 'The Black Parade' in 2007, which encouraged many people of the Rock or \"Emo\" persuasion, to colour their hair black. No matter who you are however, if you hear the song, you'll know it.\n\nFall Out Boy - Thnks fr th Mmrs\n\n\"No way is this song 10 years old!\" - a usual reaction to this song but once you realise the chimpanzees in the video are texting on a Nokia XpressMusic phone, that's when you realise it's a decade old this year.\n\nFall Out Boy returned after a two year hiatus in 2007 and hit rockers with 'Infinity on High', which also featured 'This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race' and really cemented themselves as one of the ultimate 00's bands.\n\nParamore - Misery Business\n\nYes, really, Hayley Williams and co. released 'Misery Business' a decade ago this year. Now you can officially feel old.\n\nProbably one of their most famous songs off their second album 'Riot', 'Misery Business' was regularly featured on Kerrang! TV (and still is!) along with being another which was played regularly played out of a Samsung D600 when you were hanging out with your friends.\n\nSean Kingston - Beautiful Girls\n\nNow, sometimes, you should leave a good song well alone and make no attempts to remix it, but everyone who loved this song can forgive Sean Kingston for mixing Ben E. King's 1961 classic, 'Stand By Me'.\n\nIt really won everyone over and definitely got people singing along to the catchy lyrics. It has a 10 year anniversary this year along with all the other cracking songs in this list.\n\nFoo Fighters - The Pretender\n\nYep, Foo Fighters really released this anthem 10 years ago. Dave Grohl formed the band back in 1994 which will probably make you feel even older.\n\nBut 'The Pretender 'is one of those songs which never really ages which is why it's another most people are shocked at when they realise it's a decade old in 2017.\n\nGood Charlotte - Dance Floor Anthem (I Don't Want to Be in Love)\n\n\"Put up your hands and say I don't want to be in love!\" - Another surprising song hitting double figures this year. Good Charlotte formed in 2003 and had a knack of writing songs which teenagers at school could relate to.\n\nThe aptly named 'Dance Floor Anthem' was another great track released by the band and still a feel good song to sing and dance along to.\n\nChris Brown - With You\n\nIn November 2007, Chris Brown released his debut album, Exclusive, which shot him to fame.\n\nHis fan base grew over night and he won the hearts of many with his dance moves and vocals on hit, 'With You' which is still to this day one of his most successful songs.\n\nAvril Lavigne - Girlfriend\n\nFollowing on from hits such as 'Sk8er Boi', 'Complicated' and 'Happy Ending' was going to be a mammoth task for Avril Lavigne, however, in 2007 she released 'Girlfriend'.\n\nShe released 'The Best Damn Thing' in 2007 after a three year hiatus, meaning fans were eager to see what she had been working on, and the first track off the album was 'Girlfriend'. The track went Platinum twice in the United States and Gold in the UK, all because she doesn't like your girlfriend.\n\nOneRepublic - Apologize ft. Timbaland\n\nThe first song OneRepublic released and it was endorsed by Timbaland, possibly one of the most successful R&B producers of the noughties.\n\nOne critic once described Timbaland's vocals on this track as \"Sounding like Chewbacca from Star Wars screaming in the background\" which can't be unheard, however, this track is definitely one which stuns people when they realise it's 10 years old in 2017.\n\nMark Ronson - Valerie ft. Amy Winehouse\n\nIn 2007, Mark Ronson covered 'The Zutons' song, 'Valerie' with Amy Winehouse and the song actually out performed the original so well, people forget it was the British Indi band which originally sang it.\n\nNevertheless, Mark Ronson and Winehouse did such a good job on the song it, it was nominated for 'Song of the Year' at the 2007 Brit Awards.\n\nKanye West - Stronger\n\nDoes anyone remember Kanye West before his war started with Taylor Swift? Or his marriage to Kim Kardashian? If you do, then you'll remember his early hits, including the likes of 'Stronger'.\n\nOff his third album, 'Graduation', 'Stronger' emulated Daft Punk's 2001 hit 'Harder, Better, Faster' which stormed the charts in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand and also made 'Shutter Shades' fashion.\n\nSo there you have it, 14 songs which you either thought were older or younger than 10 years old... but definitely not 10 years old!", "The iPhone 8, Apple's newest flagship phone -- for now -- went on sale last week, and reports are starting to trickle in that some users' new phones are coming apart at the seams.\n\nMost of the reports have been from Taiwanese and Chinese media outlets, according to The Next Web, and show phones where the screen panel has bulged out from the device, apparently because the battery expanded while charging.\n\nIn some cases, the phone owner was able to completely remove the front of the phone after it had started to bulge out.\n\niPhone\u304c\u6628\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u81a8\u3089\u3093\u3067\u308b\u3002\n\nApple\u3001\u65e9\u304f\u56de\u53ce\u3057\u306b\u304d\u3066\uff01 pic.twitter.com/sRx6orgxi6\n\n-- \u307e\u3054\u3053\u308d (@Magokoro0511) September 25, 2017\n\nAccording to Chinese site Phoenix New Media (link in Chinese), one customer bought a 64 GB iPhone 8 Plus, and started to see the screen bulge after about three minutes. Another customer reported that their iPhone arrived with the screen already bulging out from the device.\n\nApple confirmed to Mashable that it was looking into the issue, and it appears that the few bulging phones that have been discovered so far have been isolated incidents. Apple wasn't immediately available to confirm to Quartz what was causing the bulging problem.\n\nOne of Apple's battery suppliers is reportedly Samsung's battery division, Samsung SDI, which was the same division that created the exploding batteries in Samsung's Note 7 in 2016. The phone ended up being recalled around the world after multiple reports of the phones catching fire or exploding surfaced.\n\nThere aren't many great reasons to shell out for the $700-and-up iPhone 8 over the other seven phones Apple is now selling, so perhaps now it's best just to wait to see whether any more separating iPhone 8s emerge.\n\n\u5c4a\u3044\u305fiPhone8plus\u3001\u958b\u3051\u305f\u3089\u65e2\u306b\u81a8\u3089\u3093\u3067\u305f pic.twitter.com/eX3XprSzqv\n\n-- \u307e\u3054\u3053\u308d (@Magokoro0511) September 24, 2017\n\nRead full story", "One of the newest Samsung high-end tablets, the Galaxy Tab S3 9.7-inch was on sale quite a few times in the last few months.

Reports indicate that Samsung and Huawei are currently testing their flagship devices for Android Oreo. Meanwhile, HMD has confirmed many of its smartphones will update to Android Oreo before the end of 2017.\n\nSamsung is currently testing Android 8.0 Oreo for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ under the firmware numbers G950FXXU1BQI1 and G955FXXU1BQI1, according to SamMobile. Details about the update recently surfaced on the Geekbench benchmark service. Prior reports have indicated that Samsung plans to soon begin its Android 8.0 Oreo beta testing program for Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ owners. There is no word on exactly when the official update will roll out onto devices.\n\nThe Huawei Mate 9 smartphone has also been spotted on Geekbench running Android 8.0 Oreo, which likely means Huawei is testing the device of an official update.

Other Android manufacturers expected to update devices to the new software include LG, Sony, Motorola, HTC, OnePlus and Essential. \u200b", "At Apple's latest event this September, the company unveiled the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus in all their so-called glory. Tim Cook stood proudly as he scanned through a gallery of photos highlighting the historical changes of the iPhone. He used the term \"innovation\" to prepare us for what was supposed to be a revolutionary duo of devices, but ultimately fell flat. Even with the heavier price tag, I was already swayed to purchase the iPhone X because - both under the hood and aesthetically -- the iPhone 8 models are just like their predecessors.\n\nAs renders of the iPhone X began to leak, along with the $1,000 price tag, I was already writing it off as a phone for the elite -- similar to the $17,000 4k gold Apple Watch. I was content with choosing the in-between device. But when Apple debuted its promotional video for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, I was utterly confused. Aside from the semi-new color variants, it was the same old familiar design. I automatically had flashbacks to the iPhone 4 with its glass back. It was tough to process how, with an iPhone X in the mix, the iPhone 8 or its companion were even necessary.\n\nIt was tough to process how, with an iPhone X in the mix, the iPhone 8 or its companion were even necessary.\n\nI'm as loyal an Apple fan as you can get, but this year, it was tough to look past the features the company considers so new when presenting the next-generation of iPhones. At the keynote, Apple waxed lyrical about everything from the Retina HD display to the cameras and speakers. But when comparing the 8 and 8 Plus to last year's iPhones, and the ones before them, the correct term is improved.\n\nBoth the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 lineup have a 4.7 and 5.7-inch Retina HD display, respectively, as well as 12MP rear cameras and 7 MP front-facing cameras. The Plus versions also boast dual cameras, and even though the 8 Plus has its fancy, new beta Portrait Lighting feature - 7 Plus users still have Portrait Mode. They're also both 3D Touch enabled, hold 3GB of RAM, measure in at almost exactly the same dimensions, and all that's \"new\" about the stereo speakers is that they're 25 percent louder with deeper bass.\n\nThe biggest differences between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 models are the True Tone display, a far more powerful processor, and the ability to charge wirelessly -- all of which are included on the iPhone X. If I'm going to invest money and commit to a device, I'd prefer it to have an edge on those that came before it.\n\nApple iPhone 6\n\nSince its first big debut, the iPhone has kept to its traditional and recognizable style. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus represented a new direction, but since 2014 iPhone designs have barely changed -- aside from software. Meanwhile Android smartphones have been experimenting with bezel-less screens and pushing the boundaries of display quality.\n\nI found myself bored and searching for an iPhone that would look different than what I've had in the past -- which ultimately led me to the iPhone 7 Plus, strictly because of its size. When both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Note 8 launched, I was envious of the edge to edge displays before the iPhone X was even confirmed to have a similar look. It made me see my iPhone differently, realizing the thick bezels - included on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus -- feel dated and obsolete.\n\nIt's hard to escape the feeling that the iPhone 8 is just a glorified iPhone 7 with improved color resolution, a smaller battery, and a better processor. The 8 Plus adds a Portrait Lighting feature you'll probably only use every so often. No one is going to ask you what phone that is when you take it out of your pocket. No one is going to want to get a closer look. Because the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are just so familiar-looking.\n\nIf you think the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus look dated now, imagine how they'll look in a year or two.\n\nWhen comparing the iPhone X to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, it's undeniable they carry almost the exact same features. But the gorgeous, edge-to-edge, OLED screen on the X looks modern and sleek -- proving that Apple is starting to switch up the iPhone look to keep up with the times. The aesthetic pushes the X far past the 8 and 8 Plus.\n\nWe got to spend a little time with the iPhone X and our hands-on review mentions the 5.8-inch OLED display is extremely vibrant, with brighter icons than ever. Since I probably don't stare at anything as much as my smartphone, high-quality is always better. With HDR and Dolby Vision support, the iPhone X will help to support my binge-watching habits.\n\nThe new bezel-less display allows the iPhone X to pack a 5.8-inch screen into a body that's similar in size to the iPhone 8 which only has a 4.7-inch screen. A screen that's also an inferior IPS LCD panel with a much lower resolution. Even with rumored delays into 2018, the design and screen alone are worth the wait. You're paying more for a phone that actually delivers more, literally.\n\nEven though facial recognition might have its kinks to work out, the TrueDepth camera is another distinguishing feature from the other iPhones and every other smartphone out there. It's a huge step up from the constantly evolving home button, which went from being a physical button to Touch ID to utilizing a taptic engine. It's also the direction most smartphones are clearly heading in - with Samsung debuting its 'Iris Scanner' last year.\n\nIf you still think the iPhone 8 Plus is the better option, take the smaller battery into consideration. The iPhone X houses a 2,761mAh battery, in comparison to the 8 Plus' 2,691mAh battery. Even its predecessor -- the iPhone 7 Plus - packed a 2,900mAh battery. As for wireless charging and fast charging, they're the same on the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X. You're going to have to buy the wireless charging pads, power adapters, and cables no matter what new iPhone you buy, so it may as well be the best one.\n\nThere's been a lot of focus on the $1,000 price tag on the iPhone X, but most people will get it on a contract. Major carriers are charging around $30 per month for the 8, what if you could have the X for an extra ten bucks a month? It's not hard to justify spending that kind of money for a completely different device that's genuinely offering something new compared to your old iPhone. If you think the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus look dated now, imagine how they'll look in a year or two.\n\nWe're not surprised at the reports of disappointing iPhone 8 sales. Apple's past iPhone launches have attracted huge crowds, whereas this year, there were only a few Apple Stores reporting any lines at all. Customers apparently haven't been impressed by the limited number of new features and the same old design.\n\nIf Apple considers the iPhone X the \"future of the smartphone,\" and it's highly likely all iPhones will start to look like the X in the future, why would we be satisfied with a design from 2014? We might as well all take the inevitable plunge now. Don't waste your money on an iPhone 8, save a little extra and snag the real star of Apple's show - the iPhone X.", "Android manufacturers are having a fantastic year. Between the Galaxy S8, OnePlus 5, Note8, the HTC U11, and the upcoming Pixel 2, there is a massive variety of solid smartphones on the market.\n\nThe LG V30 is also another worthy consideration. It's got a design panache we've not seen from LG. It also boasts a host of features which may set it apart, even this late in the smartphone release season.\n\nI've been using a pre-production unit of the LG V30 for the past month as one of my daily drivers, and it's one of the best devices I've handled this year. The V30 isn't coming out surrounded by as much fanfare as its predecessor the G6, but it's got a lot going for it.\n\nThe LG V30 has all the fixings of the latest flagship smartphones. It's powered by a Snapdragon 835 SoC and 4GB of RAM, the same set of specifications powering the majority of this year's flagship devices. But it comes chock full of a few smaller features that make it just as worth the cash as anything Samsung and Google's putting forth.\n\nIt also comes with some meaningful features that make it just as worth the cash as anything put forth by Samsung or Google. The V30 is water-resistant. It can charge wirelessly using either Qi or PMA. It's also got an easy-to-reach rear-fingerprint sensor, which functions as the phone's Home button.\n\nThe V30's 3300mAh battery charges by USB-C. It boasts Quick Charge 3.0, too, so you won't wait hours for the phone to juice up. Not all flagship phones have these features. Water-resistant chassis have become more of a standard for high-end phones, but there are still too few manufacturers that include it by default.\n\nI'm especially impressed by the crispness of the V30's sound. Whether it's a Spotify playlist, a Snapchat confessional, or a Youtube video featuring the latest beauty guru, the phone's built-in Hi-Fi quad DAC audio makes even dull content sound like it's broadcasting in a venue with vaulted ceilings.\n\nIt's same technology as in the earlier the LG V20, but now there are additional customization options. The phone allows you to adjust the sound balance between left and right headphones. Using DAC decreases distortion and noise, and helps improve dynamic range. You don't need fancy headphones or earbuds to take advantage of this feature, either, though if you do have a pair, you'll appreciate the added oomph even more.\n\nBefore the G6, the last few LG smartphones were design duds. The V30 is a polished device with all the trimmings of a flagship. Its aluminum chassis has attractive rounded corners, flush buttons, a rear-camera lens, and a nearly bezel-less 6-inch POLED display.\n\nAt 5.5 ounces, the V30 is also a light device. This feels refreshing compared to the latest crop of dense and heavy smartphones, like the Note8 and Essential Phone.\n\nLG hasn't always offered the best Android interface, even if it is one of the manufacturers behind a majority Nexus devices. The V30, however, features an editable Android UI with flat icons and a spacious Home screen. You can even choose how many Quick Settings to display and which ones are most relevant for your day-to-day use.\n\nLG has bundled in a couple of extra software features in other parts of its interface. The camera app, for instance, contains a variety of filters and modes to make creating content second nature. There's a floating shortcuts bar and a Game Tools overlay that makes it simple to start recording your progress the minute you launch a title. The Smart Settings feature, which is buried in the settings menu automates the V30's configurations based on its location or whether you're connected to a Bluetooth device or wired headphones.\n\nA lot of these features work very well, but you don't have to use any of them. you'd rather just keep things simple. The choice is always nice, and it's why we're Android users, isn't it?\n\nIn keeping with the dual-camera setup that initially debuted in last year's LG G5, the V30 also features dual 16-megapixel and 13-megapixel cameras, the latter of which is a wide-angle lens. This configuration gives the V30 an edge by offering a wider field of view. Other dual-camera setups on the market, like the Note 8 and Moto Z2 Force, feature a second optical zoom lens, which is useful for zooming in but not so much for capturing landscape shots. The V30's wide-angle lens is also helpful if you're attempting to fit a group of people into one photo.\n\nIn addition to its stellar rear-cameras, the LG V30 also offers DSLR-like manual controls for video, which are handy in low-light environments, for instance, since you can manually increase the device's exposure as you see fit. The V30 also includes the ability to shoot in log format, or Cine-log, which is typically a format found on DSLRs or mirrorless cameras. Log allows you to take the video into a post-production app and manipulate the color profiles to your heart's content.\n\nMy favorite part of the V30's camera is its quick launch capabilities. Double-press the volume down button to start the camera app, and begin shooting. The added filters aren't too hokey, either. If you're feeling moody and would rather shoot in black and white, that's easily done. The V30's camera app makes it easy to export of a GIF from videos, too.\n\nThere are plenty of other Android smartphones you could very well choose over the LG V30. Considering what you get for this phone's $800 starting price point -- a stunning 6-inch display, high-fidelity speakers, dual cameras with stellar video capabilities, a water-resistant chassis (you know you want to take this into the shower), an expansion slot, wireless charging -- this is one of the best smartphones of the year.\n\nFor more on the LG V30 and why it might be your next choice of smartphone, check out everything we have to say about it!", "One trend we've seen growing in the smartphone market is water resistance. As users take their handsets with them almost everywhere they go, it's great to know that they can live through an accidental dunk in the pool. Here are our picks for the best water resistant Android phones that you can buy as of September 2017.\n\nUAG Cases\n\nFirst, a quick explanation of how the market determines a phone's water and dust resistant level. These come in the form that look likes \"IP68.\" The \"IP\" stands for Ingres Protection, a standard created by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The first number, in this case, '6', means the level of dust resistance. Most smartphones have this level, and it stands for \"No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust tight).\"\n\nThe second numerical number represents the water resistance. In many cases, we'll see smartphones tout either a '7' or '8' rating. The '7' rating is set as \"Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1m of submersion).\" The '8' ranking bumps that up to 1.5m of submersion for up to 30 minutes.\n\nOne last thing to remember is that these phones are marketed as water resistant, not waterproof. Although both the OEMs and carriers will advertise the use of these devices underwater, if any water damage does take place, you will be held liable, and your warranty will most like be voided.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 8\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8 is at the top of our list because it's the newest and most premium, but it's also the most expensive smartphone. Samsung has been a leader in getting its flagship phones high IP ratings so that its customers can use the devices almost anywhere they go. Samsung continues this trend by making the Note 8 IP68.\n\nWhat really sets the Note 8 apart from the crowd is its built-in stylus called the S Pen. With it, users can take handwritten notes, capture specific sections of their displays, and navigate around the interface without having to use their fingers.\n\nThis is also the first flagship from Samsung to feature dual rear-facing cameras. Samsung uses the secondary telephoto lens to create depth and background blur (bokeh) effects. This works in conjunction with the Snapdragon 835 CPU, 6GB of RAM, and 6.3-inch Super AMOLED display.\n\nYou can purchase the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 from the following outlets starting around $930:\n\nAmazon Samsung Best Buy Verizon AT&T T-Mobile Sprint\n\nLG G6\n\nThe LG G6 also comes with an IP68 water and dust resistant rating. The best part about this phone is that its price has dropped to the point that it's half of the cost of the Note 8.\n\nUnlike last year's LG G5, the G6 drops the company's attempt at modularity and comes swinging with a \"bezel-less\" display called FullVision and a premium looking all-glass design.\n\nBesides that, the G6 is pretty much identical predecessors; it features LG's skinned version of Android, has dual rear-facing cameras with a 125-degree wide angle lens, and an appropriately placed fingerprint sensor located below the camera array. Its biggest drawback is the fact that it shipped with a slightly slower Qualcomm 821 processor.\n\nYou can purchase the LG G6 from the following outlets starting at around $450:\n\nAmazon LG Best Buy Verizon AT&T T-Mobile Sprint\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8/S8+\n\nIf the Galaxy Note 8 is either too big or too expensive, you might want to check out the Galaxy S8 or S8+. Both of these handsets have almost identical specs to Samsung's newest flagship smartphone, but you will be missing out on the dual rear-facing camera setup and 2GB of less RAM.\n\nBoth of these handsets are also IP68 rated and will be able to handle taking photos and videos underwater.\n\nYou can purchase the Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+ from the following outlets starting at around $700:\n\nAmazon Samsung Best Buy Verizon AT&T T-Mobile Sprint\n\nLG V30\n\nAt the end of August, LG took the wraps off of its second flagship smartphone of the year: the LG V30. This device has everything that people loved about the G6 but included performance improvements, a 32-bit Quad DAC, high-sensitivity microphones, and a 16MP camera sensor featuring an f 1.6 aperture.\n\nThe LG V30 is unfortunately not available for purchase just yet, but when it is, it'll feature an IP68 rating. As it will hopefully be available in the coming weeks, it has been added to this list. Links to purchase the handset will be added as soon as possible.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 Active\n\nAs stated previously, Samsung has been a leader in smartphone water and dust resistance. One of its most \"durable\" and protected devices has been the Active line, made in conjunction with and for AT&T. This hasn't changed this year as Samsung has released the S8 Active, featuring the exact same internals as the other two S8 variants.\n\nThe biggest difference with the Active is its build materials such as rubber bumpers which gives it a US Military Standard (MIL-STD) rating. This means that beyond being water and dust resistant, it can resist extreme weather and can take a beating.\n\nThe other big difference is that unlike the curved glass found on the S8 and S8+, the Active features an entirely flat display. This can be seen as a plus for those who dislike accidentally tapping on things when palm rejection doesn't work.\n\nYou can purchase the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active from the following outlets starting at around $850:\n\nAmazon Samsung (AT&T) Best Buy (AT&T) AT&T\n\nHTC U11\n\nHTC has been shaking things up with its smartphone design this year. While in years past, the company has been known for making premium handsets made out of metal, it chose to start from the ground up and introduce phones with an all-glass backing with highly-reflective color schemes.\n\nJust like almost every flagship released in 2017, the U11 features a Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, and a top-of-the-line camera. Its main differentiating feature is its squeezable frame that acts as an input method for launching any of your applications or hardware functions.\n\nUnlike the rest of the devices on this list, the HTC U11 is only rated at IP67, but that should still be enough to protect it from the rain and taking a quick shot under the surface of your pool.\n\nYou can purchase the HTC U11 from the following outlets starting at around $650:\n\nAmazon HTC Best Buy (Sprint) Sprint\n\nAnd if none of these handsets fit your fancy, you can always check out LifeProof's collection of water and dust resistant cases. These cases do add a bit of bulk to your phone but are handy if you're ever heading somewhere where your handset might get wet or dirty.\n\nLastly, if none of these phones are what you're looking for, make sure to check out our other Best Phones guides.", "The Gear Fit 2 Pro is advertised as iPhone compatible -- but the app to make it so hasn't been approved by Apple yet.\n\nWhen it was announced in August, the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro fitness tracker was touted as being compatible with Android phones and iPhones.

SUNY Poly is trying to get rid of $115 million worth of one-of-a-kind pieces of manufacturing equipment for computer chip factories that don't even exist yet.\n\nThe machines, known as \"tools\" in the industry, were once part of the Global 450 Consortium.\n\nThe G450C as it was known was a five-year, $1 billion research program put together by SUNY Poly and the world's largest computer chip companies to study making chips on 450 millimeter diameter silicon wafers that are twice the size of the standard 300 mm wafers used today.\n\nThe G450C program ended last year after its members, including Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Intel, decided that the time wasn't right to move to 450 mm wafers even though they are eventually expected to offer huge costs savings to the industry.\n\nEver since then, SUNY Poly and the Research Foundation for SUNY, which owns the tools, have been trying to make space for potential new tenants.\n\n'They (the G450C tools) are still in the same place in NanoFabX,\" said Paul Kelly, associate vice president for consortia and initiatives at SUNY Poly. \"They're idling or they were shut down completely. We're now at a point where we're going to move the tools out.\"\n\nSUNY Poly and the Research Foundation have given the tool manufacturers first crack at buying the equipment back, but there have been no takers.\n\n\"For the most part these are alpha tools, first of their kind tools,\" Kelly said. \"But most of them (the tool makers) aren't rushing to get their tools back.\"\n\nAfter offering the tools to research partners and other SUNY schools, the tools will be offered for sale per state guidelines.\n\nDon't expect there to be a windfall. The tools' uniqueness has driven their value to \"significantly less\" than the purchase price of $115 million, although such write-downs are not uncommon with cutting edge research equipment.\n\nThat doesn't mean the G450C was a bust either. Kelly said that the industry was able to create an entire 450 mm wafer manufacturing line at NanoFabX, a first. And the chip makers were able to advance 300 mm chip making as well, Kelly said.\n\n\"The program was an enormous success,\" Kelly said.\n\nEarlier this month SUNY Poly's research arm was awarded a $38.5 million grant to help pay down the debt on the NanoFabX building and get it ready for new tenants.\n\nHalf of the building is used for the Center for Semiconductor Research, a partnership between IBM, SUNY Poly and other chip companies to shrink the size of chip transistors to close to the atomic level. Earlier this year, the CSR announced it had made a transistor measuring 5 nanometers, the smallest ever.\n\nFormer SUNY Poly president Alain Kaloyeros had been expecting a phase 2 to the G450C that would have have potentially brought in more than $1 billion to the school and kept NanoFabX full for another five years. But his arrest on criminal bid-rigging charges a year ago resulted in that deal and others falling through.\n\nThat has led to financial troubles at SUNY Poly that also resulted in the school obtaining a $30 million loan from the SUNY system to get it back on solid footing. The $38.5 million from the state came from a $207 million stabilization fund created for the school in the most recent state budget.\n\nKelly is hopeful that SUNY Poly will soon have a new tenant or tenants for NanoFabX, although neither he nor other school officials have said who might be interested.\n\nThe irony is that any new tenants would be working on 300 mm chip making, or even 200 mm chip making, which is an older wafer size that has seen a resurgence with demand for new chips in cars and other internet connected devices.\n\nGlobalFoundries, which employs 3,000 people at its chip factory in Saratoga County, runs a former IBM chip factory in Vermont that uses 200 mm wafer tools.\n\nSUNY Poly and General Electric are also making power electronics chips using silicon carbide wafers that are processed on 200 mm tools.\n\n\"There's been a rebirth of 200 mm technology,\" Kelly said.", "Xiaomi is following in the footsteps of many OEMs and releasing its apps onto the Play Store for faster updates, which avoids the long waits of firmware upgrades. However, Xiaomi is doing something differently: it's allowing users of other brands' devices to use its apps. After the capable Mi Calculator, now we have Mi FileExplorer on the Play Store. The app is still marked as \"Unreleased\" so it's still in beta, but from my tests it seems to work quite well.\n\nMi FileExplorer reminds me of the built-in file browser I've seen on my Samsung and LG devices: there's a regular directory browser, but also a per-type categorization that lets you view all your stored images or videos or APKs or documents (and other types) regardless of which folder they're in. And like all file explorers, there's a search function and all the expected actions like renaming, moving, copying, deleting, sharing, and so on.\n\nHowever, Mi FileExplorer has a couple of bonus features that you may not find in your run-of-the-mill browser. First, there's zip/rar archive support for compressing or decompressing. Then there's a built-in cleaner for ridding your phone's storage of cache files. And finally there are a couple of options for wirelessly sharing files: Mi Drop for nearby devices, and an FTP server that lets you browse your device's storage from a nearby computer. It might not be as full-featured as Airdroid but it'd do the job in a pinch.\n\nYou can grab Mi FileExplorer from the Play Store for free and give it a go to see how it compares to your existing (or inexistent) file explorer. It should technically be compatible with many brands and devices, not just Xiaomi's. It's showing as compatible with my S7 Edge, my Galaxy Tab S2, and my Nexus 5X, but not with my Nexus 7 (2013) tablet. If you want to try it on an incompatible device or if you'd rather go the alternate download road, we've also got it on APK Mirror.", "The Galaxy Note 7 was indisputably one of the best Android phones of 2016, before the battery issues and the subsequent consecutive recalls killed the device in its tracks. It's rumored that Samsung rushed into the design of the Galaxy Note 7 in an attempt to beat Apple to market with the iPhone 7, leading to some supply chain issues with batteries sourced from Samsung SDI. Now it appears as though that same battery manufacturer might be giving Apple a few headaches.\n\nReports of the iPhone 8 Plus screen separating from the body of the phone have popped up in Taiwan and Japan, suggesting there may be an issue with supply in Asia. The Taiwanese report says the phone separated after being placed on the charger for a few minutes.

Introduced in India on September 12, the Galaxy Note 8 features the Infinity Display design, inherited from the Galaxy S8 series. The improved dual-lens camera makes Galaxy Note 8 superior to Galaxy S8 series, Also, don't forget the revamped new S-Pen.\n\nRecent launches of iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and the more expensive iPhone X has allowed Samsung to take over its command in the flagship smartphone category in India. The reason for Samsung Galaxy Note 8 having the upper hand is the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus didn't turn out to be as impressive as expected, while the more competent iPhone X is priced expensively. To add to it, the new S-Pen being offered with the Galaxy Note 8 is far more superior to any Apple's offerings in the smartphone section.\n\nBoasting a huge 6.3 inch Quad HD plus Super AMOLED display, in a dual curved edge frame, it is as big as it gets for a smartphone without being too inconvenient. The massive screen on the Galaxy Note 8 is protected by one-time screen replacement offer by Samsung with every purchase.\n\nSuperior to the Galaxy S8 series, the camera on the Galaxy Note 8 is a setup of dual 12MP rear cameras, one having an aperture of f/1.7 and other has an aperture of f/2.4. Although the DSLR like background-blur is limited to some specific objects only, won't necessarily work on a pet or football. The smartphone has optical image stabilization on both the lenses, coupled with dual-tone LED Flash. Coming to the front, the 8MP selfie camera is the one sure to impress most of us.\n\nGalaxy Note 8 is powered by an octa-core Exynos 8895 processor and 6GB of RAM, having a non-removable 3,300mAh battery, with 64GB internal memory which is expandable up to 256GB, ought to make tech-geeks impressed eh? The new S-Pen stylus is now made to look and feel almost as a real pen. The smartphone is IP68 water-resistant, and interestingly, so is the S-Pen stylus, which can take up to 100 notes on a locked screen mode.\n\nIt runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and comes with Bixby digital assistant, which has been optimised well for Indian accents. Asim Warsi, Senior Vice President, Mobile Business, Samsung India, upon receiving an enormous response for the smartphone stated, \"Our ear to ground approach led by innovative technologies across product and service categories have made Samsung a popular choice amongst consumers, and it is a great honour to be bestowed upon with this recognition.\"\n\nSamsung made sure to deliver the latest technologies like USB Type-C port with 3.5mm headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, and what music lovers will surely love, a pair of AKG earphones out of the box.\n\nThe competitive market led Samsung to reduce the prices of Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus to Rs 53,990 and Rs 60,990 respectively, while the flagship Galaxy Note 8 is priced at Rs 67,900, available online at Amazon India and Samsung Store, as well as at various retail outlets.", "If you go the reconditioned route with phones, you can save an absolute PACKET - the Galaxy S7, for instance, costs just $299\n\nMost people, when updating their phones, think they HAVE to get a new phone. But this isn't the case. There are other options and ways to acquire a phone.\n\nBuying a reconditioned phone - i.e. one that has been used, but restored - is probably one of the best options around, as you can get a phone that looks and feels brand new for around 40-50% less than buying the same handset new.\n\nGazelle does a massive range of iPhones, Samsung phones, iPads, and MacBooks. They're all used and reconditioned units, but they will look as good as new and function the same.\n\nSo if you're in the market for a new phone, but you don't fancy spending the best part of $1000 and also getting yourself locked into a two-year contract with a network or carrier, the going reconditioned could be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThere is currently a 20% discount on top of the reduced price right now over at Gazelle on Samsung phones, so if you decide to go for a Galaxy S7, for instance, you can pick one up for just $299 (with an additional 20% discount on top), which is a pretty decent deal.\n\nThe Galaxy S7, while a year old now, is still a very powerful Android phone. It looks brilliant and features a myriad of excellent specs and features. It also has one of the best cameras in the business and will get Android Oreo before the close of the year.\n\nLast year, a new Galaxy S7 would have cost you around $800 SIM-free and now, 12 months later, it can be yours for under $300. That's a massive depreciation hit and you, as a savvy user, could stand to take advantage of it right now, rather than splashing the cash on a brand new phone, like the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, and still get all the performance and features you like.\n\nEach new iteration of a phone is always better; the specs are developed and aspects of the handset's performance are refined. But to say there is a $400 difference between a new Galaxy S8 and a reconditioned Galaxy S7 is absurd - most users will not be able to tell the handset - or how it performs - apart.\n\nDo I do this? You bet your ass I do. In the past, I have saved a fortune using reconditioned iPhones, MacBooks, iMacs, and Galaxy Note phones. And the best part is once you have it, no one knows any different.\n\nIt's like when you buy a car, I'd much rather someone take the lion's share of the depreciation before I come in and run it.\n\nSame applies to phones, just with smaller amounts of money.\n\nBut what I like best about this route is that you get a flagship phone for a mid-range price. And on top of this, because you can now actually afford to buy it outright you can then shop around for the best rolling monthly contracts.\n\nNo more 24-month contracts. No more waiting around for an upgrade; if you don't like the phone, sell it, and get a new phone.\n\nSimple.", "This guide explains how to disable the Edge screen on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. While the Edge screen gives you quick access to apps, contacts, and features, it also gets in the way for some. If you find that this feature is more irritating than useful, you'll be happy to know it's easy to turn off.\n\nFor those wondering, the Edge screen is the small white panel that sits on the upper edge of your display. Swipe it out, and you'll instantly see your favorite contacts and popular apps. There's also a feature called Edge lighting, where the slides glow for incoming notifications.\n\nRead: 8 Best Galaxy S8+ Screen Protectors\n\nOver the past few years, Samsung has bundled this into each Galaxy smartphone. There are over 14 edge panels to choose from, not to mention others you can download. However, many owners never take advantage of its capabilities. Instead, it just gets in the way. Here's how to get rid of it.\n\nIf the Edge panels are in the way more often than not, head into settings and quickly toggle it off. Below we'll also explain all the customization options, for those who still want to use it but want to move it to a different area on the screen.\n\nAs you can see above, this entire process takes less than 20 seconds. Just navigate to settings and turn the Edge screen off. Alternatively, swipe open the Edge panel and hit the gear-shaped button on the bottom middle of the screen. This is the customization section, and there's also an OFF toggle on the top right to quickly disable the Edge screen. Either method works just fine to get rid of this feature.\n\nWhile your first reaction is probably to completely turn off the Edge screen on the Galaxy S8, try customizing it first. There are tons of different options built-in, and more you can download that give your phone lots of neat features.\n\nAdditionally, we recommend moving it to a more convenient location before giving up on it completely. Samsung includes the option to decrease the size of the panel, or make it transparent so it isn't as noticeable. Here's how to change things up.\n\nFrom here, the first option is to drag the Edge panel handle up or down anywhere on your screen. If you keep hitting it on accident, move it to a place you're less prone to touch. Then, select the left or right side, change the size of the panel, and make it transparent so it's not so noticeable.\n\nWe recommend making it as small as possible and moving it to the top left of the screen. Now, you'll never accidentally hit the Edge panel, yet it's still available if you need it.

But Blendtec hasn't yet put the iPhone 8 or Galaxy S8 through the blend test, so Maksimuk decided to take matters into his own hands, giving each gadget some time in a Cuisinart on turbo mode.\n\nHow did the iPhone 8 hold up in the blender? And how did it fare in comparison to the Galaxy S8? Check out the video below.\n\nSpoiler alert: neither held up very well, but the Galaxy S8 fared better.\n\nFirst was the iPhone 8, which sustained serious screen damage on its first pass in the Cuisinart before getting stuck. On its second blend, the iPhone 8 was completely decimated. Within a span of about 20 seconds, all that remained of the handset was a bunch of small pieces and a whole lot of dust.\n\nThat brings us to the Galaxy S8. After a good bit of blending, the handset was still mostly intact, save for the battery, which flew off the device and blended into dust. \"The Galaxy S8 just seems more durable, it's not breaking apart into different pieces really, really quickly,\" Maksimuk says in the video.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't try this at home. \"The smoke that I inhaled out of that blender was not pleasant,\" the YouTuber wrote.", "FCC chairman Ajit Pai demanded that Apple enable FM radio tuners in iPhones. But there's one significant detail Apple was keeping to itself: iPhones -- at least the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 -- don't have FM radio chips.\n\nPai framed his request around the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and his belief that FM radio access could be invaluable to those looking for help. \"When wireless networks go down during a natural disaster, smartphones with activated FM chips can allow Americans to get vital access to life-saving information,\" he wrote in a public statement.\n\nAlmost every smartphone has an FM radio built inside, but manufacturers have historically deactivated the chips. Carriers and phone makers feared users would listen to the radio instead of connecting to a mobile network to stream music, therefore decreasing data demands and hurting services like Apple Music and YouTube.\n\nThe hysteria has died down in recent years, and most companies including Samsung, LG, and Motorola are now selling handsets with the FM tuner enabled. But Apple hasn't followed suit, and Pai isn't giving up.\n\n\"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first. As the Sun-Sentinel of South Florida put it, 'Do the right thing, Mr. Cook. Flip the switch. Lives depend on it,'\" Pai wrote.\n\nBut there is no switch. Apple responded to Pai's request by explaining why it isn't possible to fulfill and assured that its own \"modern\" safety measures are effective in emergency situations.\n\n\"Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and that's why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products,\" the company said in a statement. \"Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\"\n\nApple did not comment on why it chose to remove the FM tuner, or whether it would enable it in pre-iPhone 7 devices.\n\nFM radios can serve as a lifeline to people in need of help after an emergency. As photos of Irma showed, strong hurricanes are capable of destroying cell towers, potentially shutting down cellular services for months. FM and AM frequencies are more efficient and can be picked up from dozens of miles away from a radio station. The information transmitted on FM radio -- like where to get donations or dangerous areas to avoid -- could be life-saving.", "With Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 hitting the shelves and Apple's iPhone 8 not far behind, how will you decide when it's time to give your current phone the flick?\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nWith Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 hitting the shelves and Apple's iPhone 8 not far behind, how will you decide when it's time to give your current phone the flick?\n\nAussies replace their smartphones every three years, according to finder.com.au, but of course that's only an average figure. Some of us always upgrade our phone at the end of our 12 or 24-month contract - perhaps feeling like we're getting a \"free\" phone even though the cost is built into the contract compared to a SIM-only plan.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some people would hang on to their phones for much longer than three years. They'll stick with a handset until the screen breaks, the battery dies or it becomes painfully sluggish when performing simple day to day tasks - just like some people drive their old car into the ground before replacing it.\n\nDo you only buy a new smartphone when the old one bites the dust? Photo: Ben Margot\n\nI'd say there's a rough correlation between a handset's price tag and how often you replace it. If you feel the need to drop $1000 on this year's flagship Apple or Android smartphone then you'll probably be prepared to do so again in a year or two, even if the old handset is still meeting your needs, to ensure you've always got the latest and greatest.\n\nYou might even sell your old handset to offset the cost of the upgrade, Finder breaks down a few options for those who are happy to part with their old phone rather than handing it down to someone.\n\nOn the other hand if you're satisfied with a sub-$500 Android handset then you're probably not going to feel the need to upgrade just because a newer model comes along with a few extra bells and whistles.\n\nFinder's figures don't break down the upgrade stats by price tag, but the age demographics are still telling. It seems that 55% of Gen Y smartphone owners replace their handset every two years or less, dropping to 38% for Gen X and 22% for Baby Boomers. It's not unreasonable to assume that Gen Y smartphone owners tend to favour more expensive handsets than Baby Boomers.\n\nThose Baby Boomer figures would also be boosted by those who were forced to upgrade by Australia's 2G shutdown, throwing away their old Nokia 3200 and stepping up to a basic smartphone like the Moto G3. If they hung onto their last phone for a decade or more, they won't be in a rush to jump on the smartphone upgrade cycle.\n\nYour priorities also change over time. As a Gen Xer who sits in the middle, over the years I've found myself replacing my phone a bit less often and my car more often.\n\nAnother factor is that a two year-old smartphone isn't as terrible as it once was. By the time the iPhone 4 hit the shelves, the iPhone 3 was struggling to keep up. That won't be the case with the iPhone 7 when the iPhone 8 arrives, even if the 7 groans a little under the first few releases of iOS11 - perhaps a deliberate ploy by Apple to encourage you to upgrade.\n\nWe went through the same thing with desktop computers and later notebooks. There was a time when a two year-old PC was painfully slow but that's no longer the case so we replace them less often.\n\nIs the smartphone in your pocket looking a little long in the tooth? How will you decide when to retire it?", "If you're thinking seriously about cutting the cord and streaming your way to entertainment bliss, Amazon Channels should be in focus.\n\nAmazon Channels is a service available to Amazon Prime subscribers that gives you the kind of access to content you want, on the devices you want. And since it's been generally well-received among content creators, it's getting new content all the time. As time goes on, therefore, Amazon Channels should get more appealing to cord-cutters.\n\nStill, there are some who might question what Amazon Channels is and why they should check it out. So, in this FAQ, we'll explain Amazon Channels' key features, how much you'll pay, and how it stacks up to the competition.\n\nWhat Is Amazon Channels, Anyway?\n\nAmazon Channels is a collection of streaming services you can subscribe to via Amazon. You need only to go to the Amazon Channels page, find out which content providers are offering their content through the service, and you're off. Many of the channels offer free trials so you don't need to worry about doling out cash right away to try it out.\n\nThink of Amazon Channels as the e-retail giant's answer to those who want to stream content anywhere and everywhere but don't want to rely on just one service to do it.\n\nMORE: Amazon Prime Streaming Guide - Best Movies and TV Shows\n\nHow Much Does Amazon Channels Cost?\n\nAmazon Channels is free to access for Prime members, but you'll need to pay individual subscription fees for individual channels. So for instance, if you want access to HBO, you'll get a 30-day free trial and then you'll be required to pay $14.99 per month for access to that programming. If you only want access to PBS Kids, however, you'll need to pay $4.99 per month after a 7-day trial.\n\nBasically, the cost will vary depending on which Channels you want to subscribe to and how many you're interested in.\n\nWhat Content is Available?\n\nHere's a list of some of the better Amazon Channels:\n\nHBOShowtimeCinemaxStarzSeeSoComic Con HQHistory VaultComedy Central Stand-UpPBS MasterpieceIndiePix UnlimitedDocComTVSmithsonian EarthReelzDaily BurnPBS KidsShudderChedar Uh, Where's Netflix and Hulu?\n\nWhen you work your way through Amazon Channels, you'll find that there are some wildly popular streaming services, like Netflix and Hulu, that aren't available. While Amazon hasn't closed the door on supporting those services in the future, it's unlikely we'll see them join Channels anytime soon.\n\nHow Do You Get It?\n\nOne of the great things about Amazon Channels is that you can watch the content just about anywhere you might be. The service obviously works in the browser through Amazon's own video player, but you can also access it on your Android device or iPhone, a slew of tablets, and on several smart TVs from companies like LG, Panasonic, Samsung, and others. Here's a handy list from Amazon that will tell you all the devices Amazon Channels should stream content to.\n\nMORE: Is Prime Worth It? Here's the Best Perks\n\nDo You Need to Be a Prime Member?\n\nYes. Amazon Channels is only available to Amazon Prime members. You'll need to pay $99 per year to become a Prime member.\n\nHow Does It Compare to Netflix and Hulu?\n\nAmazon Channels is fundamentally different than Netflix and Hulu. Those are standalone services, requiring a single fee, that enable you to watch all of their content. And the content they offer comes from several different sources and rotates throughout the year depending on content-distribution partnerships they have with content providers.\n\nAmazon Channels, on the other hand, is a collection of streaming content services that you can subscribe to through the e-retailer's offering. So, there's no single Amazon Channels interface where you'll watch all the content you want like Netflix and Hulu. Instead, Amazon Channels is a place where you can subscribe to the content you want and watch it through Amazon Video on any number of devices. Amazon handles all payment processing to the channels you subscribe to.\n\nSimply put, think of Amazon Channels as a hub to access other streaming services.\n\nIs This Different Than Amazon Video?\n\nAmazon Channels is part of the broader Amazon Video service. Amazon Video is the catch-all for Amazon's many video-streaming and purchase services. Amazon Channels is part of Amazon Video, allowing you to access content and stream it all through the Amazon Video interface.\n\nMORE: Best Streaming Serives - Amazon vs Netflix vs Hulu\n\nHow Often Is Content Being Added?\n\nAmazon Channels' popularity has been soaring in recent months, meaning more content providers are signing on all the time. If you don't like what you see or are looking for more Channels to check out, be sure to check back: Amazon Channels is getting new content on a regular basis.\n\nWhat If I Want to Cancel a Subscription?\n\nOnce you sign up for an Amazon Channel, the e-retailer will use the credit card information you have on file through its payment platform and facilitate regularly monthly billing. You won't sign any contracts with the service and you won't be required to keep a subscription for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhen you're done subscribing to the Channel, simply log into your account and go to Your Video Subscriptions. You'll see your monthly subscriptions, and you can cancel any you wish -- at any time -- right from there.\n\nSee Also : Is Amazon Prime Worth It?

There are three key areas in which the G5S Plus outperforms the cheaper G5 Plus: screen size, design and the presence of an all-new dual 13-megapixel camera setup.\n\nFor those benefits, both configurations of the G5S Plus cost $50 more than equivalent versions of the G5 Plus, which cost $229 and $299. However, that doesn't tell the whole story, because at launch, Motorola has cut the cost of the G5S Plus by $50, meaning you can get the phone for what you'd pay for a G5 Plus. That pricing is for a limited time, though.\n\nThe result is a slight improvement on our favorite sub-$300 handset, though perhaps not enough of an upgrade to justify the higher price tag.\n\nThe G5S Plus starts at $279 for 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, and $349 for 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Motorola calls this phone a special edition, and it's available unlocked and compatible with all four major U.S. carriers.\n\nMotorola typically plays it safe in the design department, especially with its lower-priced phones, with a general shape and aesthetic that run through its entire range. The G5S Plus doesn't do anything to buck that trend, but there's still a lot to like here.\n\nThe differences in fit and finish versus the standard G5 Plus are actually quite striking when you sit both phones side by side. Whereas the earlier model employed a discreet mix of metal and plastic, the G5S Plus features a new unibody chassis with a slightly larger footprint that looks and feels much more premium.\n\nMoto G5S Plus (left) and G5 Plus (right)\n\nThe proof is in the details. The diamond-cut edges make for a nice contrast against the aluminum body. Slightly slimmer bezels, particularly at the bottom, make the G5S Plus feel like a modern smartphone, and the subtly curved 2.5D glass adds another layer of polish you typically don't find in devices in this price range.\n\nIf I have one gripe, it's that the oversized circular camera housing could use some trimming. It sticks out like a sore thumb, and breaks up the clean lines and smooth surface of the aluminum. I accidentally grazed it on several occasions while holding the phone, and each time, it felt awkward -- like a fridge magnet randomly tacked onto the rear.\n\nThe Moto G5 Plus already featured one of our favorite displays in a budget phone, so how does the G5S Plus' screen compare? For the most part, well. Both Moto phones employ 1080p screens, but the discrepancy comes down to size. The G5S Plus' LCD is slightly larger, at 5.5 inches, compared with the G5 Plus' 5.2-inch panel.\n\nRatcheting up the size with the same number of pixels obviously causes a slight drop in sharpness, but the G5S Plus' display is so superb -- particularly when it comes to color representation -- that we didn't care. The trailer for Maze Runner: The Death Cure absolutely popped, with striking contrast and vibrant hues no matter the viewing angle.\n\nColor accuracy proved to be the G5S Plus' greatest strength. In our testing, this phone's screen registered a Delta-E rating of 0.29. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) That not only outperforms the G5 Plus' score of 0.94, but it's on a par with the Samsung Galaxy S8's 0.28. Few smartphones, at any price, come close.\n\nColor range performance was also strong. Showing off 109 percent of the sRGB color gamut, the G5S Plus scored in the same ballpark as its closest competitors -- the similarly priced ZTE Blade V8 Pro (112 percent) and Huawei Honor 6X (114 percent). It's a far cry from the color range you get from a phone with an OLED panel, but it's on par with other phones in the G5S Plus' price range.\n\nIn terms of brightness, the picture isn't quite so rosy for the G5S Plus. While Motorola's earlier G5 Plus delivered a very impressive 591 nits, its latest phone came in at just 400 nits. That's slightly below the 433-nit average for smartphones, as well as the scores from the ZTE Blade V8 Pro (430) and the Honor 6X (444 nits). It's a disappointing step back for an otherwise class-leading display.\n\nThe G5S Plus is powered by Qualcomm's midrange Snapdragon 625 processor. That's the same chipset featured in the regular G5 Plus, and unsurprisingly, performance is equally snappy in the new model. No matter how many Chrome tabs we opened, or how much scrolling or app switching we did, it didn't slow down.\n\nWe tested the Moto G5S Plus configuration with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Those are flagship numbers for a budget handset, though you won't find them in the less-expensive variant of the G5S Plus, which features half the storage and a gigabyte less of RAM. The memory deficit in the less-expensive version means it likely won't handle multitasking quite as well as the model we tested.\n\nMeasuring overall system performance with Geekbench 4, our G5S Plus delivered a score of 4,126 -- better than the G5 Plus' 3,746. That phone was already among the fastest in the sub-$300 segment, so seeing the G5S Plus edge it out was a nice surprise.\n\nMORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones\n\nGraphics performance was pretty much more of the same. This handset produced a 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited score of 13,805. That situates the G5S Plus between the G5 Plus and the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, which scored 13,862 and 11,897, respectively.\n\nBoth versions of the G5S Plus include a microSD slot to add an extra 128GB of storage. Sadly, U.S. devices miss out on NFC for Android Pay. Budget handsets typically lack NFC, but the G5S doesn't feel as low-end as its price suggests, and considering customers elsewhere in the world get it, the NFC omission is difficult to overlook.\n\nSimilarly frustrating is the lack of 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity, which prevents the G5S Plus from reaching the highest data speeds over home and office wireless networks. This was a shortcoming of the original G5 Plus that really should have been fixed with the special edition, yet was left unaddressed.\n\nFor years, dual cameras were a luxury fit only for the most expensive, cutting-edge handsets. With the G5S Plus, Motorola has brought the tech to one of its more modest devices for the very first time. Unfortunately, after spending some time with the phone's dual rear cameras, we're not so sure it was worth the trouble.\n\nThe G5S Plus carries two 13-MP sensors on the back, as well as an 8-MP one for selfies -- all of which feature an f/2.0 aperture. As on the Moto Z2 Force, one of the rear cameras shoots in monochrome, and is designed to capture only light and detail without color. Yet unlike with the Z2 Force, you can't use that lens exclusively for black-and-white photography, which is a bit of a letdown.\n\nStill, that second lens allows the G5S Plus to pull off depth tricks, like bokeh, which adds an artistic blur to the background of your photos. When used in normal mode, however, the results are surprisingly underwhelming.\n\nComparing the same skyline shot between the G5S Plus and another budget 13-MP dual-camera offering, ZTE's Blade V8 Pro, we see Motorola's auto white balance has opted for a greener tint. There's less contrast overall, which helps retain some fidelity that's lacking in the ZTE's darker exposure. But if you zoom in dead center, you can't actually discern the bricks on the buildings as easily with the G5S Plus. Everything kind of gets muddied together, with no sharpness.\n\nIn low light, however, the G5S Plus' more balanced contrast helped it achieve a more detailed shot in comparison to the one from the Blade V8 Pro. The Motorola picked up intricacies in the texture of my hand and the wall that the ZTE missed.\n\nThe Motorola phone wins some more points with its superior depth effect mode, which lets you adjust the focus and strength of the blur before and after shooting. It's a feature that feels magical the first time you use it, and compared to the Blade V8 Pro, the result looks more like what you'd find on a genuine full-size camera and less like a simulation achieved through software.\n\nShooting in this mode, though, you encounter a critical issue: The images simply take too long to capture on the Moto G5 Plus. You'll have to wait up to 6 seconds for the phone to process and save some images with bokeh enabled. And when it's complete, you're still left with an image that lacks clarity where you want it.\n\nThe regular G5 Plus may only have a single camera, but it sports a superior f/1.7 aperture and speedier dual-pixel autofocus. When the novelty of the dual cameras wears off and the frustration sets in, we know which we'd rather have.\n\nUp front, the G5S Plus utilizes an 8-MP sensor, improving on the 5-MP sensor in the G5 Plus. A front-facing flash sits alongside the wide-angle lens, and the overall results from this camera are bright and balanced. However, they exhibit a slight lack of clarity compared to the images from the Blade V8 Pro, which is most evident in my hair and the pattern of my shirt.\n\nThis phone will last you all day.. The G5S Plus' 3,000-mAh battery topped out at 11 hours and 50 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which consists of continuous web surfing over T-Mobile LTE. That's more than 2 hours past the 9:40 smartphone average. The just-released iPhone 8 Plus, a device that costs more than three times as much, even comes up short by about a half-hour.\n\nMORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life\n\nIf you're wondering how it stacks up on a more level playing field, the G5S Plus delivered nearly 10 more minutes of use than the G5 Plus, which has the same size battery. The aforementioned Blade V8 Pro defeated both, at 12:08.\n\nLike most Motorola phones, the G5S Plus comes packaged with a TurboPower fast charger. In this instance, the adapter provides 6 hours of juice in 15 minutes when connected to the wall.\n\nAndroid phone makers don't always understand the value of restraint when it comes to software, but fortunately, Motorola does. The G5S Plus launches with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and aside from a slightly modified launcher and a helpful suite of optional gestures housed in the Moto app, this is stock Android in all its elegant, simple glory.\n\nWith Moto Actions, you can eliminate the on-screen navigation bar for an even roomier display, and use the G5S Plus' front-mounted fingerprint sensor as a full replacement. There's a shortcut to access the phone's flashlight with a chopping motion, and another that immediately opens the camera app when you twist the phone.\n\nIn addition to gestures, the Moto app includes Moto Display, an interface that discreetly and briefly presents notifications when the phone is locked. There's more to be found in the Moto app, and we strongly recommend trying out everything it has to offer.\n\nMORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full Potential\n\nTo sweeten the experience, Motorola has also announced it will bring Android 8.0 Oreo to the entire G5 range in the coming months. However, owners shouldn't expect an update to Android P in 2018, as the company typically holds its budget products to just one year of software support.\n\nIn nearly every respect, Motorola's latest phone equals or improves on the already compelling G5 Plus. And yet, the answer to the question \"Should you buy one?\" still cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.\n\nIf you're looking to take the plunge while Motorola is selling the G5S Plus for the same price as the standard model, you should go for it. You'll appreciate the more meticulous design and more pleasant user experience compared to rivals like the $200 Honor 6X and $230 Blade V8 Pro.\n\nOnce Motorola retires that promotion, it'll be a harder call to make. At $279 for the base 32GB/3GB model, the G5S Plus can't justify a purchase on the merits of its dual cameras alone. A slight edge in performance isn't going to account for that price difference, either. And if you're considering going the Amazon Prime route to nab an ad-supported G5 Plus for $185, the gulf in pricing is even wider.\n\nAs great as the G5S Plus is, the first G5 Plus was already among the best bargains in the business. Although the special edition is mostly better, it's not as good a value -- meaning the original remains the best bargain option for Android users.", "Apple is investigating reports iPhone 8 Plus devices bursting open\n\nApple fans finally have their hands on the iPhone 8, but two owners in Asia have already busted their new phones under strange circumstances.\n\nAn iPhone 8 Plus owner in Taiwan says that her five-day-old 64GB device split open while charging, according to The Next Web. The owner claims she was using the official Apple charging cord, and after about three minutes, the phone started swelling, and she pulled it off the charger.\n\nAnother iPhone 8 Plus owner in Japan also claims his phone started splitting open. The weird thing about his story is that he didn't even have an opportunity to charge his new device. He claims that his phone's screen was bursting open from the second he unboxed it.\n\nThe most likely culprit for these screen issues is battery swelling, but there are currently no definite answers from the reported incidents or from Apple.\n\nTwitter user Magokoro0511 shared multiple images of the alleged iPhone screen issue, including a few photos with it still in the box.\n\nThe first busted iPhone has reportedly been returned to Apple for investigation, and an Apple rep confirmed to Mashable that the company is looking into the incidents. The company, however, is not commenting on either of the incidents.\n\nSo far, these are the only two cases that have surfaced online, so the bursting front panels don't appear to be a widespread issue. Importantly, there were no reports of explosions, so it's safe to say, at least for now, that this won't turn out like Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 last year.\n\nThe truth is many phone launches have at least a few hardware problems. Last year, for example, multiple reports of exploding iPhone 7 handsets emerged, but there were no widespread issues that jeopardized the integrity of the entire production line. In most cases, an isolated manufacturing flaw or user error such as improper charging, is the reason for the issue.\n\nIf pics of more bulging iPhone 8 screens start filling your Twitter timeline, there might be a cause for alarm.

They can pop out of nowhere and from anywhere, even, say, the mouth of a stalwart news-anchor star who lies about a battle he was never part of (we're looking at you, Brian Williams and NBC Universal). They can reflect something endemic to a corporate culture or an anomaly that nonetheless pulverizes all the good before it.\n\nAnd in the end none of that stuff even matters once the debacle has landed. A mess is a mess that needs cleaning up -- the job of the marketers and agencies and crisis management teams that will (hopefully) ensure that in the coming days or months or years no one will care about the nightmare that took place, and fewer still will remember it.\n\nWe profile four recent PR crises to take a look at their fails and the way they attacked them. Some, it seems, are doing better than others.\n\nThe scene was a shocker: David Dao, a doctor who refused to give up his paid-for seat in April, was forcibly pulled out of it, screaming, and then dragged down the aisle by aviation security officers. Upset passengers, some up in arms, shot the scene on phones, and videos -- one of which shows the doctor's subsequent bloody face and pleas \"to go home\" -- quickly went viral.\n\nTalk about a PR blunder. Hard to imagine things could get worse. But later that month, a giant show rabbit died during a United flight and then was cremated by the airline before cause of death was determined, leading its owners to claim a cover-up had occurred.\n\n\"Years of brand building have been lost and won't be recovered anytime soon,\" says Gene Grabowski, partner at PR firm Kglobal. And he cautions not to be misled by United's last quarterly report, which showed consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 3.9% and consolidated capacity (available seat miles) jumped 4.6% in July, year-over-year. It represents, Grabowski says, only \"short-term success.\"\n\nThe airline, of course, is trying to get back into consumers' good graces. It has made a number of changes since April, such as adding new flight routes, eliminating the red tape on permanently lost bags by adopting a \"no questions asked\" policy on lost luggage, and increasing customer compensation incentives -- up to $10,000 -- for voluntary rebooking. It also created the new role of senior VP-customer solutions and recovery, tasked to step in when a customer's trip goes off course.\n\n\"We recognize that we're on a journey to earn back customer trust,\" Maggie Schmerin, director of brand PR for United Airlines, wrote in an email. \"And we'll continue to work harder than ever to put our customers at the center of all we do.\"\n\nThe airline's united front would be more effective if mishaps were avoided. But April was followed by turbulence in July when United gave a toddler's paid-for seat to a standby customer, forcing the mother to hold the baby the entire flight. At month's end, Comic-Con passengers were banned from packing comics in their checked luggage in what was likely a misinterpretation of an old TSA blog post.\n\nThe brand is trying \"to paint a rosy picture while it continues tripping over itself in customer relations,\" says Hennes Communications VP Howard Fencl. \"To repair its reputation, United needs to upend its corporate culture and back up its promises with concrete action.\"\n\nIn less than a year, Samsung dealt with bad press on more separate fronts at one time than probably any marketer you can think of. And yet despite the onslaught of PR disasters -- phones that caught fire, washing machines reported to injure their owners and entanglement in a scandal that toppled the president of South Korea -- Samsung somehow managed to generate recordbreaking profit and win back consumers.\n\nThe most notable fiasco followed the August 2016 debut of Samsung's much-anticipated Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, the battery of which had a tendency to catch on fire. By October, the Department of Transportation had banned the phone from commercial airplanes. After a recall, an internal investigation, a resumption of sales with a \"safe\" battery and the subsequent evacuation of a Southwest Airlines flight when a Note 7 started emitting smoke, Samsung gave up on the model. There were also lawsuits and memes -- lots of memes.\n\nA month later, another product line added fuel to the, uh, fire. In conjunction with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Samsung recalled 34 models of its top-loading washing machines \"due to risk of impact injuries\" from excessive vibrations or lids coming loose. There were nine reports of wounded consumers, \"including a broken jaw, injured shoulder, and other impact or fall-related injuries,\" the commission said.\n\nAs its products evoked Stephen King's 1986 movie \"Maximum Overdrive,\" in which machines turn against humans, Samsung's de facto CEO, Lee Jae-yong, found himself in the middle of a far-reaching political scandal in South Korea. In late August he was convicted on charges of bribery and embezzlement and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nIf the bizarre onslaught hurt the company's fortunes, however, it seems like it's going to pull through pretty well. Operating profit in the second quarter hit $12.7 billion, a new high for the company, and its mobile division fell but remained in the black. Earlier this year, Samsung also snagged three top honors at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity for a Galaxy smartphone ad about an ostrich learning to fly by using VR.\n\nExperts say Samsung was able to survive its crises by halting all marketing for a time, save for an apology ad, and being open with consumers, regulators and the media. Last November, it addressed the Note 7 debacle with a full-page mea culpa in publications like the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, which noted that \"we are truly sorry.\"\n\nDuring the Oscars telecast in February, Samsung ran several commercials that focused on its rigorous product testing. But it also began to pivot back to other messages: YouTube personality Casey Neistat appeared in another spot, representing and courting the sort of creative types who shoot and produce everything with their phones.\n\nAnd Samsung significantly raised the ante when in March it introduced its Galaxy S8 phone, delivering a curved screen, better colors, facial recognition and a slew of other upgrades, and, this month, the the Galaxy Note 8, the successor to the explosion-prone version.\n\nFree chips and guacamole. Buy one burrito, get one free. Online games. New ads. None of it could save Chipotle after food-safety woes. Now the \"Food With Integrity\" chain is pinning its hopes on a new hero: queso.\n\n\"You shouldn't underestimate how much potential it has,\" Chief Marketing and Development Officer Mark Crumpacker told Chipotle investors in July, ahead of the fast-food chain's national queso debut.\n\nIt's been about two years since E.coli-induced restaurant closures, norovirus and salmonella outbreaks first put Chipotle in the spotlight, and it has yet to find firm footing. Early apologies to the public fell flat. Its stock price plunged. And a mix of fixes, including the implementation of new cooking procedures and staffing protocols, led by James Marsden, the newly hired executive director of food safety (think: more hand washing and staying home when sick), didn't help its bottom line.\n\nLast year was bleak: Comparable sales plunged 20.4%, transactions declined 14.4%, and total revenue fell 13.3%. And Chipotle had other issues to contend with, including Crumpacker's arrest on cocaine charges, an activist investor buying shares, shuttering its small ShopHouse Asian chain and board shakeups including the departure of the co-CEO, Monty Moran.\n\nAnd just as news was improving -- Chipotle's same-store sales rose in the first two quarters of 2017 -- bad news reared its head. A malware attack hit card transactions in March and April. A fresh norovirus outbreak at a Virginia location in July was believed to stem from someone working while sick, proving that issuing protocols doesn't mean everyone follows them. And, oh yeah, rodents fell from the ceiling of a Texas location, an incident captured on video. Though it may have had more to do with a structural issue in the building than store cleanliness, the video went viral and viewers were plainly disturbed.\n\nChipotle is forging ahead, hoping some of its latest efforts will kick-start a rebound: playing up its clean-label ingredient lineup in new ads, app updates, service tweaks. It's also continuing to open hundreds of locations each year, with plans for its first drive-through. After all, some patrons need more than queso to convince them to give Chipotle another shot.\n\nVolkswagen went from Fahrvergn\u00fcgen to Farfrumlegal in the wake of its 2015 emissions scandal. And once-proud owners who drove diesel VW vehicles for their environmental appeal were not shy about expressing their outrage that the company had cheated on emissions tests. One ad agency even sold magnets at VWsham.com meant to be displayed on VWs with slogans such as \"Future former VW owner,\" \"VW. German for FU,\" and, yes, \"Farfrumlegal.\"\n\n\"We had a surge of interest,\" says Nat Gutwirth, a partner at Philadelphia-based agency Left Hand Creative, which created the magnets in partnership with Jonathan Perloe, a communication strategist. \"People who were driving these cars were embarrassed for having been bamboozled, so we wanted to give them an emblem of their outrage to share their discontent. We're still getting orders here and there.\"\n\nBut two years later, VW appears to have put the worst of the scandal in the rearview mirror, based on its sales and profits, even as it shells out billions of dollars to settle legal claims. Globally, the Volkswagen Group reported second-quarter operating profit that more than doubled. In the U.S., unit sales of VW branded vehicles jumped 5.9% in the first seven months of 2017, according to data compiled by Automotive News. Sales at VW Group of America, which includes Audi, were up 5.7%. Volkswagen Group's stock has not fully recovered, however. Preferred shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange traded for 127.15 euros Aug. 10, compared with 190.85 euros on the same date in 2015 before the scandal broke.\n\nIn the midst of the scandal, VW resisted the temptation to run a big-budget apology campaign that might have only brought more attention to the issue. Efforts have been more tactical, like running newspaper ads in late 2015 that declared \"we're working to make things right,\" while plugging a customer goodwill program.\n\nIn the U.S., the comeback strategy involves selling more family-friendly SUVs and electric vehicles, while plugging high-tech features such as driver-assistance systems. VW this year even turned to a grandma for help, putting a 78-year-old Irish immigrant in a series of emotional ads for the new Atlas SUV in a campaign by Deutsch L.A. that broke in May.", "There's always going to be a few bum units that make it past the quality assurance phase when it comes to mass production, but when it's Apple, the pinnacle of perceived mass mobile technology luxury, it's going to be a \"point and laugh\" situation.\n\nTwo reports, one each from Taiwan and Japan, have surfaced in the first week of shipments for the iPhone 8 Plus where the device bloated to the point where the display separates from the chassis.\n\nIn the Taiwanese incident, one Ms. Wu received her unit on September 23. The separation occurred three days later after it was on the charger for just three minutes. An Apple Store received the unit for repairs and is investigating.\n\nThe Japanese user posted pictures of their unit, which came separated from right out of the box.\n\nifeng relays from South Korean media that the batteries that may be responsible for the bloating are sourced from Samsung SDI and LG Chem -- the two make batteries for many smartphones from different manufacturers, though SDI is known as being involved in producing the batteries for the recalled Galaxy Note 7.", "Get What's On updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nReady to feel old? Well, we have you covered with some of the great hits which were released in 2007... 10 YEARS AGO!\n\nIt was the year the iPhone was announced, J.K Rowling completed the final Harry Potter book and the year Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning UK monarch.\n\nThese songs are turning a decade old this year and we've found 14 gems which will take you back to a simpler time, before Justin Bieber.\n\nListen to them in the video above!\n\nLet's kick off the list:\n\nRihanna - Umbrella ft. Jay-Z\n\nFor the entire time this song was at number one in the UK, it rained. But it was okay, because Rihanna's catchy lyrics reminded you to pick up your umbrella before you left the house.\n\nThe song fused R&B with a rocky undertone and really appealed to everyone at the time and you probably still remember all the lyrics to the song too.\n\nFergie - Glamorous ft. Ludacris\n\nYes! 10 years ago we all learned how to spell 'glamorous' correctly thanks to some help from Fergie... and now we can't spell it without singing the tune to this song either.\n\n2007 was a really good year for R&B and Hip-Hop!\n\nSoulja Boy - Crank That (Soulja Boy)\n\nIf you were 15 and enjoying your summer holiday from school, this song was probably blasting from your Sony Ericsson W810i, CyberShot or whatever amazing 'brick' phone you had.\n\nThe dance, which featured heavily in the video to this song, was almost as popular as the single itself. Everyone had a go at trying to do the dance, some failed, some pulled it off.\n\nMy Chemical Romance - Teenagers\n\nA teenager with a love for rock music? Then this song was definitely the anthem to your year!\n\nMy Chemical Romance released, arguably, their most successful album with 'The Black Parade' in 2007, which encouraged many people of the Rock or \"Emo\" persuasion, to colour their hair black. No matter who you are however, if you hear the song, you'll know it.\n\nFall Out Boy - Thnks fr th Mmrs\n\n\"No way is this song 10 years old!\" - a usual reaction to this song but once you realise the chimpanzees in the video are texting on a Nokia XpressMusic phone, that's when you realise it's a decade old this year.\n\nFall Out Boy returned after a two year hiatus in 2007 and hit rockers with 'Infinity on High', which also featured 'This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race' and really cemented themselves as one of the ultimate 00's bands.\n\nParamore - Misery Business\n\nYes, really, Hayley Williams and co. released 'Misery Business' a decade ago this year. Now you can officially feel old.\n\nProbably one of their most famous songs off their second album 'Riot', 'Misery Business' was regularly featured on Kerrang! TV (and still is!) along with being another which was played regularly played out of a Samsung D600 when you were hanging out with your friends.\n\nSean Kingston - Beautiful Girls\n\nNow, sometimes, you should leave a good song well alone and make no attempts to remix it, but everyone who loved this song can forgive Sean Kingston for mixing Ben E. King's 1961 classic, 'Stand By Me'.\n\nIt really won everyone over and definitely got people singing along to the catchy lyrics. It has a 10 year anniversary this year along with all the other cracking songs in this list.\n\nFoo Fighters - The Pretender\n\nYep, Foo Fighters really released this anthem 10 years ago. Dave Grohl formed the band back in 1994 which will probably make you feel even older.\n\nBut 'The Pretender 'is one of those songs which never really ages which is why it's another most people are shocked at when they realise it's a decade old in 2017.\n\nGood Charlotte - Dance Floor Anthem (I Don't Want to Be in Love)\n\n\"Put up your hands and say I don't want to be in love!\" - Another surprising song hitting double figures this year. Good Charlotte formed in 2003 and had a knack of writing songs which teenagers at school could relate to.\n\nThe aptly named 'Dance Floor Anthem' was another great track released by the band and still a feel good song to sing and dance along to.\n\nChris Brown - With You\n\nIn November 2007, Chris Brown released his debut album, Exclusive, which shot him to fame.\n\nHis fan base grew over night and he won the hearts of many with his dance moves and vocals on hit, 'With You' which is still to this day one of his most successful songs.\n\nAvril Lavigne - Girlfriend\n\nFollowing on from hits such as 'Sk8er Boi', 'Complicated' and 'Happy Ending' was going to be a mammoth task for Avril Lavigne, however, in 2007 she released 'Girlfriend'.\n\nShe released 'The Best Damn Thing' in 2007 after a three year hiatus, meaning fans were eager to see what she had been working on, and the first track off the album was 'Girlfriend'. The track went Platinum twice in the United States and Gold in the UK, all because she doesn't like your girlfriend.\n\nOneRepublic - Apologize ft. Timbaland\n\nThe first song OneRepublic released and it was endorsed by Timbaland, possibly one of the most successful R&B producers of the noughties.\n\nOne critic once described Timbaland's vocals on this track as \"Sounding like Chewbacca from Star Wars screaming in the background\" which can't be unheard, however, this track is definitely one which stuns people when they realise it's 10 years old in 2017.\n\nMark Ronson - Valerie ft. Amy Winehouse\n\nIn 2007, Mark Ronson covered 'The Zutons' song, 'Valerie' with Amy Winehouse and the song actually out performed the original so well, people forget it was the British Indi band which originally sang it.\n\nNevertheless, Mark Ronson and Winehouse did such a good job on the song it, it was nominated for 'Song of the Year' at the 2007 Brit Awards.\n\nKanye West - Stronger\n\nDoes anyone remember Kanye West before his war started with Taylor Swift? Or his marriage to Kim Kardashian? If you do, then you'll remember his early hits, including the likes of 'Stronger'.\n\nOff his third album, 'Graduation', 'Stronger' emulated Daft Punk's 2001 hit 'Harder, Better, Faster' which stormed the charts in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand and also made 'Shutter Shades' fashion.\n\nSo there you have it, 14 songs which you either thought were older or younger than 10 years old... but definitely not 10 years old!", "IPhone X has generated excitement about broader OLED adoption\n\nDifferent colors flicker from screens using Universal Display Corp.'s technology. The one investors see is green.\n\nIts shares have more than doubled this year, adding $3.4 billion in market value, as adoption of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, technology in Apple Inc.'s iPhone X raised hopes for widespread use. OLED is an alternative to the liquid crystal displays that are critical components in everything from televisions to smart watches.\n\n\"There's a huge opportunity ahead of them,\" Scott Searle, an analyst who covers Universal Display for Benchmark Co. in New York, said in an interview. \"It's still very early days.\"\n\nSnaring the world's most valuable company as an end customer marked a major milestone for Universal Display's 20-year quest to persuade electronics manufacturers to adopt OLED, which is thinner and more energy efficient than LCD, while offering better image quality. The bet looks to be paying off as the stock has risen the most this year in the 283-member S&P North American Technology Sector Index.\n\nUniversal Display has the highest price to sales ratio in that group and is trading at about 12 times 2019 sales estimates. The average for the index is three times.\n\n\"The Apple effect is very, very powerful,\" said Sidney Rosenblatt, Universal Display's chief financial officer, in an interview last month. \"They need the technology because it is better.\"\n\nOLEDs are composed of thin films of organic molecules that create light with the application of electricity. Phosphorescent OLEDs -- the red and green ones that Universal Display supplies -- produce light through a mechanism that is more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs. Universal Display is working on blue phosphorescent emitters to enhance energy efficiency and make the technology even more appealing to panel manufacturers.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. introduced the first full-color OLED screen in 2010 with its Samsung Galaxy S phone. The company is supplying OLED displays for the iPhone X and licenses some of the core technology from Universal Display, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple will have to wait until at least 2019 to move beyond Samsung for significant alternative supplies of OLED screens for the iPhone, people familiar said last month.\n\nLG Display, a long-time supplier of LCD displays used in the iPhone, has committed to invest about $13 billion in OLED production lines through 2020.\n\nWhile long-term investors in Universal Display have their sights on expanding OLED technology in television displays and vehicle consoles, analysts say production constraints are the biggest challenge.\n\nMore OLED production would mean more revenue for Ewing, New Jersey-based Universal Display, which licenses its patents and supplies materials used in manufacturing.\n\n\"If you line up the capacity that's out there in the next several years, you can see a path to where up to 50 percent of the smartphone market is being served by OLEDs,\" said Searle.\n\nThat could translate into as much as $5 in adjusted earnings per share by 2020, he estimated. That's almost five times the profit Universal Display reported in 2016. Even so, Searle maintains a hold rating on the stock due to valuation and near-term capacity constraints.\n\n\"Eventually, as capacity becomes available, OLED will take over devices,\" said Rob Stone, an analyst for Cowen & Co. in Boston, in an interview. He expects a third of smartphones will have OLED displays this year, up from an estimated 26 percent last year.", "Taking a screenshot is one of the more basic functions that our smartphones offer and we tend to forget how convenient and useful a feature it is. Samsung's flagship devices offer multiple ways to take a screenshot, and in typical Samsung fashion, this feature has been further enhanced as well. Here are all the ways you can take a screenshot with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8!\n\nWith the physical home button no longer available up front, Samsung has gone to the standard set of hardware controls that is available with all Android smartphones when it comes to taking a screenshot.\n\nUsing this gesture to take a screenshot has become one of Samsung's staple features. It does the same as the button method, but it is much faster and simpler once you get used to it.\n\nKeep in mind this is an advanced feature, so it can be turned off. Toggle it on/off by going to Settings>Advanced features>Palm swipe to capture.\n\nHave you ever used Samsung's scroll capture feature? It allows users to grab an image of more than what your physical screen can display. It's great for capturing entire scrollable pages or apps in a single image.\n\nThis feature is found in a section called Smart Capture, which can be turned off. Toggle it on/off by going to Settings>Advanced Features>Smart capture.\n\nTake things to the next level with TouchWiz Smart Select. This feature makes it possible to create screenshots in the shape of ovals and squares. You can also put GIFs together and pin screen sections (keeps them floating above the UI).\n\nThere are special functions within each feature here. For example, one can extract text from screenshots. It is also easy to draw over them, share and more. Smart Select is a feature within the Edge panel, which can be deactivated within the settings. Toggle it on/off by going to Settings>Display>Edge screen>Edge panels.\n\nSo, there you have it for all the ways you can take a screenshot with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8!", "The Apple iPhone 8 Plus is for those who prefer iPhones and want a newer one, but don't want to spend $1,000 or more on an iPhone X.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus has the same basic design and footprint as the 2016 iPhone 7 Plus, which mirrored the 2015 6s Plus, which in turn echoed the 2014 6 Plus. That means the 8 Plus is the fourth generation of hardware from Apple to rely on a nearly identical design. The big change in this year's phone is the switch from a metal rear panel to glass. The glass is nice, but, to be frank, I'm done with this form factor; it's dated and tired. I wish the 8 Plus were different from older iPhones, but that's why Apple created the pricier iPhone X.\n\nThere's no question that Apple makes high-quality devices. The front glass panel of the 8 Plus is curved along the edges and it tucks into the metal frame seamlessly. The same can be said of the glass that forms the rear surface. The metal frame itself is rounded gently and is comfortable against your skin. There are no sharp or pointy edges anywhere; the iPhone 8 Plus is incredibly smooth all the way around. The 8 Plus comes in space gray, silver, and a new shade of gold. The rose gold option has vanished from the lineup, as has the piano black finish, and the (product) Red variant. The glass of our space gray review unit definitely looks more gray than black.\n\niPhone 8 Plus\n\nLike the previous three generations of Plus models, the iPhone 8 Plus is gigantic. At 6.25 inches tall and 3.1 inches wide, it's one of the bigger phones out there. If you have small hands, the 8 Plus might be too much phone. I know many who prefer the more compact footprint of the standard iPhone 6/6s/7/8.\n\nAt more than 7 ounces, the 8 Plus is also very heavy. The size and weight together make the phone an obvious burden to your pocket. The smooth and rounded shape of the phone means it won't get snagged on pocket liners.\n\nThe quality of materials and manufacturing is top notch, as to be expected. Apple continues to build some of the most confidence-inspiring hardware in the world.\n\nThe 8 Plus has an IP67 rating for protection from water and dust. You can dunk the phone in 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes and still have a working phone when you pull it out. It handles running water, sweat, and rain with no problem. You needn't worry about accidentally dropping it in the pool, kitchen sink, or bath.\n\nYou will, however, need to worry about dropping it onto concrete, asphalt, or other hard surfaces. Two glass panels doubles the likelihood you'll break something. The already-huge iPhone 8 Plus more or less demands it be wrapped up in a case of some sort, making it even larger. Considering how much these phones cost, I highly recommend you protect it.\n\nWhat I dislike most about the iPhone 8 Plus is its unchanged display style. While Apple's competitors have moved to all-display faces, the 8 Plus maintains the horrendous bezels seen on the previous three generations of hardware. The 8 Plus is still priced like a flagship phone, but you're no longer getting a flagship design. (For that, you have to pay even more for the iPhone X.)\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus carries over the capacitive home button from the 7 Plus. The Taptic Engine inside the phone provides physical feedback every time you press the button. You can dial in the amount of feedback you receive. I prefered the middle choice, and I'm glad Apple offers several options.\n\nWith iOS 11, a handful of actions are initiated by pressing the home button. A brief touch wakes the screen. A light press with an extra half-second of pressure will wake the screen and then unlock the phone if you have Touch ID enabled. A long-press opens Siri. Last, a double-press opens Apple Pay. I found it common to accidentally launch Apple Pay when I meant to wake or unlock the iPhone 8 Plus. Learning to finesse the home button takes some practice.\n\nThe ringer switch on the side is easy to find and use by feel, and the action is quite good. Few phones include a true ringer switch and I appreciate having it for quickly switching to silent/vibrate. The separated volume buttons below the ringer switch have good profiles and excellent travel and feedback. They double as shutter buttons when using the camera. The screen lock button and SIM card tray are positioned on the right edge of the phone. The 8 Plus's larger size means you often need to slide your thumb up the side to find the screen lock button. Action on the button is really good.\n\nYou won't find a headphone jack on the iPhone 8 Plus. The included headphones plug into the Lightning port, which is Apple's proprietary charging / data connector. Apple was one of the first to drop the headphone jack, and a few others have since followed. The iPhone 8 Plus can't charge and play music via the Lightning port at the same time unless you spend extra money on a dongle of some sort. Apple continues to rely on its own proprietary port rather than the standard -- and just as capable -- USB-C.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus's rear panel is perfectly flat, save for the camera module. The module protrudes significantly. I wish the camera did not stick out, as it makes the phone wobbly when placed on a hard surface. Using a case will resolve this issue.\n\nYou cannot access the battery. I do like the glass more than the metal of previous generations, but obviously this is a bit of a drawback. According to reports we've seen, repairing a broken rear panel on the iPhone 8 Plus will be more expensive than repairing the display itself. Get a case and/or invest in AppleCare+ insurance.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus is a well-made phone, but it's monstrously huge. I find the design boring, but Apple continues to manufacture some of the highest-quality hardware in the market.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus carries over the 5.5-inch full HD screen with 16:9 aspect ratio we've seen on the last three Plus models. Apple relies on in-plane switching LCD panels for its iPhones. The most significant change this year is Apple's move to its True Tone screen technology. Apple first deployed this tech on the iPad and now it's the iPhone's turn. True Tone automatically adjusts the white balance to match the ambient lighting. This means the screen's color will skew slightly blue or yellow so it is easier to read/see based on the surrounding light. To my eyes, the screen's tones most often looked yellow, or warm. You can turn True Tone off if you wish.\n\nThe screen adopts a wide color gamut to more accurately reproduce a full range of colors. When held side-by-side with an iPhone 7 Plus, the 8 Plus's screen did tend to pop a bit more with vibrant colors.\n\nApple says its dual\u2011domain pixels improve viewing angles, which is something LCDs typically don't do as well as OLED panels. I have no complaints about viewing angles on the iPhone 8 Plus, as the screen is easy to see as you tilt the phone from side to side. If there's any brightness drop or color shift I can't see it. The screen is easily bright enough to use outdoors under sunny skies. The oleophobic coating, which prevents fingerprints, is among the best on any phone.\n\nAs for the resolution, well, I am not as impressed. Almost every other phone in this price class has adopted quad HD resolution. With that said, the size and pixel density do suffice for browsing the web, watching videos, and enjoying social media. It's a fine display for the majority of people. (Though I'm looking forward to examining the higher resolution AMOLED display of the iPhone X later this year.)\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus is widely compatible with U.S. LTE 4G networks. There are two significant versions: the A1864 (with a Qualcomm modem) and the A1897 (Intel modem). The Qualcomm variant doubles as the Verizon/Sprint and unlocked model, while the Intel variant is for AT&T/T-Mobile. The AT&T/T-Mobile version supports Band 66 for T-Mobile, but not the new band 71 (600 MHz). If possible, we recommend you buy the Verizon or unlocked model, as it is compatible with all U.S. networks and provides the most flexibility to end users. (Obviously this will depend on your own upgrade situation.) This year, Apple is selling the unlocked model immediately alongside the carrier variants. (Apple previously waited several weeks or even months before making the unlocked model available.)\n\nWe picked up the unlocked version and tested it briefly on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. The phone works very well on these three networks. I didn't experience any trouble connecting to 4G and saw strong LTE performance on each. Data speeds were excellent. You shouldn't have any trouble streaming media, such as music or video, over 4G. Voice calls connected on the first dial and the phone didn't drop any calls when moving at highway speeds.\n\nOn the iPhone 8 Plus, calls are generally clear and free of distortion via the earpiece, though I wish voices were a bit warmer. The earpiece generates enough volume to hear calls in most places. I was able to maintain conversations on busy city streets, bustling coffee shops, and traveling cars. People I spoke to through the iPhone 8 Plus said I sounded very good.\n\nThe speakerphone introduces just a teensy bit of distortion, but it also pushes plenty of air. You can use the speakerphone at home, the office, or in the car with no problem. Ringers and alarms are pleasantly loud, and the vibrate alert is excellent.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus improves upon the 7 Plus's stereo speakers. The earpiece leans toward trebly tones when listening to music, while the bottom-mounted speaker leans toward bass-y tones whether you're holding the phone in portrait of landscape orientation. Last year's phone was somewhat imbalanced in terms of the amount of sound produced by the earpiece and bottom speaker, but the iPhone 8 Plus produces much more even sound between the two speakers. Music and video sound better no matter how you're holding the phone.\n\nEven though the iPhone 8 Plus is the same size as the 7 Plus, it actually has a smaller 2,675 mAh battery inside. This power supply is 20% to 40% smaller than those found in competing Android handsets, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison because of the different OS and custom Apple chips inside. Based on the performance I experienced, you wouldn't know it has a smaller battery.\n\nI used the phone while on a business trip and found it delivered the goods. This smartphone pushed through heavy days without breaking a sweat. I used it extensively for mapping and navigation, photography, social media, messaging, browsing, and music playback. I kept it connected to an Apple Watch via Bluetooth throughout my review period. On days when I demanded breakfast-to-bedtime battery life, despite all this usage, it managed with ease. I rarely saw the battery dip below 30%.\n\nMore importantly, the new iPhones include wireless charging for the first time. This is made possible in part by the glass rear panel. Apple selected Qi, one of two competing (and incompatible) wireless charging standards. So there are wireless charging pads out there that the new iPhones won't work with. (Today's high-end Android phones are dual-standard.) But Qi is popular, and will likely become the dominant standard now that Apple is behind it.\n\nI used the 8 Plus with a Qi wireless charger and it certainly worked, though it was slower than charging via cable. (Samsung offers fast wireless charging in its high-end phones.)\n\nAs far as rapid charging is concerned, the iPhone 8 Plus does support faster charging than older iPhones, but the included charger won't charge the phone quickly at all. You are better off using an iPad charger, which will deliver a quicker charge thanks to higher wattage. Even then, the iPhone 8 Plus still won't charge as rapidly as competing Android handsets. The best solution is to buy the Apple charger that uses USB-C on one end and Lightning on the other, as it charges the quickest.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus includes Bluetooth 5.0. This isn't overly significant right now, but it ensures the iPhone will be compatible with high-performance Bluetooth 5.0 accessories.\n\nThe 8 Plus worked with all of the Bluetooth devices I threw at it. Apple's Bluetooth software made pairing with a variety of devices a simple, painless process. Calls sent to mono headsets sounded good, while calls routed to my car's hands-free system bordered on excellent. Music pushed to a stereo Bluetooth speaker sounded awesome.\n\nThe 8 Plus offers GPS and it worked perfectly with Apple (and Google) Maps. Apple's mapping app was able to find me quickly, and location was as good as 20 feet. The 8 Plus makes for a fine navigation device via Apple Maps, which adds lane guidance in iOS 11 and better traffic notifications.\n\nNFC is on board. It powers Apple Pay, of course. But thankfully, iOS 11 unlocks the the NFC radio to do a bit more. Developers can take advantage of the NFC radio for new features, though we have yet to see these tools become available in the real world.\n\nThe 8 Plus packs dual-band WiFi with MIMO. This means the 8 Plus is compatible with the fastest WiFi networks. I had no trouble at all with the 8 Plus's WiFi.", "The value-focused Nokia 3, 5, and 6 could see a major update soon. According to an executive from HMD Global, all three phones will get Android Oreo by the end of the year. HMD is the company that produces Nokia smartphones, and its General Manager for Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia, Mark Trundie, let it slip during an interview that the phones would see the update before the ball drops.\n\nThere might be more good news. The Nokia 8's Android Oreo update might be just around the corner, too. We recently told you that HMD was testing the update and it would be released when it was \"perfect\". Well, it might be nearing perfection. According to a report from Vtechgraphy, an HMD Manager told those in attendance at a launch party for the Nokia 8 in Taiwan that the Oreo update would start at the end of October at the earliest. The Nokia 8 isn't even out in some large markets yet, so word of a major software update right around the corner is welcomed news.\n\nNokia devices run a stock version of Android, much like Motorola devices. This gives it the upper hand against competitors like Samsung and LG since it won't take it as long (in theory) to update its phones. That could be a major selling point as HMD tried to make Nokia into the powerhouse it once was.\n\nRunning stock Android is also likely what's giving extended life to Nokia's more budget-friendly devices. The 3, 5, and 6 are all priced very competitively at the low end of the spectrum. Normally, companies don't push many software updates to devices like these. Profit margins are already slim and putting man-hours into developing software updates costs money. The fact that the Nokia 3 is priced at $140 and is now seeing its second OS update in a year is impressive.\n\nIf HMD keeps it up with the inexpensive devices with stock Android and quick updates, it just may make us forget about the Nexus program.", "Now that we're under 210 days from the inevitable release of the Galaxy S9, it's time to start talking about leaks! Not long after the Galaxy Note 8 and just over 160 days since the release of the Galaxy S8, the leaks have begun to leak. The first set of details to run from the tap come in the form of code-numbers.\n\nWe're entering the first phase of leaks for one of the world's most popular smartphone lines. This is right around the same time as we began to see leaks for the Galaxy S8, as our first teaser for the Galaxy S8 came on September 13th, 2016. That was what might have been a \"testing the waters\" push by Samsung to see whether the Galaxy S8 should ditch its headphone jack since Apple started ditching said jack on the iPhone. If that wasn't Samsung's behind-the-scenes testing, it certainly served the purpose.\n\nSEE THIS: Galaxy S9 could look like this\n\nThe leak today includes a set of numbers that correspond with firmware for the next set of Samsung devices. The numbers show - or confirm - that the Galaxy S9's firmware is in development. The (quite reliable) sources that speak with SamMobile confirmed earlier today a couple of details on the Galaxy S9 as such. The firmware codes for the TWO models of Galaxy S9 are as such: G960FXXU0AQI5 and G965FXXU0AQI5.\n\nIdentifying the first set of characters gives us the code-names of both Galaxy S smartphones: SM-G960 and SM-G965. As the Galaxy S8's code-name is SM-G950 and the Galaxy S8+ has a code name SM-G955, it would seem as though we're getting a Galaxy S9 and a Galaxy S9 Plus next year. This does not necessarily mean that they'll CERTAINLY be called Galaxy S9 and/or Galaxy S9 Plus, but it's likely. It's very much extremely likely, given Samsung's release schedule and propensity to stick with a brand once they've used it in public.", "Smartphones are the main means of telecommunications in Puerto Rico, and the network, like everything else on the island, was devastated by Hurricane Maria.\n\nThe fracturing of the electric grid means, of course, that the cell towers more or less are all off line. The Reuters story, which was posted on September 29 and thus most likely relying on numbers from the beginning of the week, says that 90.9 percent were inoperable. Hopefully, that number has shrunk.\n\nThe bulk of the story describes the mad rush of people trying to find a signal:\n\nThe search for the elusive sliver of places now capable of providing a signal has become a frantic treasure hunt. Across this U.S. territory, motorists desperate to communicate are herding on the sides of highways, bridges and exit ramps, hoping that their cell phones will come back to life.\n\nThere are reports of the theft of diesel for backup generators and copper from cabling.\n\nFacebook is sending connectivity teams to the island. Other companies, including carriers, are helping in Puerto Rico as well, according to Triple Pundit.\n\nA report from The Carmel Group paints a rosy picture for the fixed wireless sector. The category, according to a story on the long report at Telecompetitor, will double from 4 million to 8 million subscribers between this year and 2021. Revenues during that period will rise from $2.7 billion to $5.2 billion.\n\nThe category will be pushed by heavyweights that are jumping in. These include Google, AT&T, Verizon and Windstream. The study sees seven reasons that fixed wireless will expand so rapidly. They range from much lower deployment costs compared to wired infrastructure and spectrum costs to the emergence of new markets such as home automation and home security.\n\nThe growing strength of fixed wireless was illustrated this week by AT&T's announcement that it has made fixed wireless service available to homes and small businesses in nine additional states. This doubles the number of states where fixed wireless is an AT&T connectivity option. In all, it is available in 160,000 locations. That number is expected to grow to more than 400,000 by the end of the year and more than 1.1 million by 2020.\n\n5G is a moving target both in terms of technology and demand. The two points are clear. There is a lot of new science involved and it all won't be ready simultaneously and the avalanche of capacity won't be needed, especially by consumers.\n\nThat is why a demonstration by SK and Samsung is important. The two companies have linked 4G and 5G networks. The former was operating at 2.6 GHz and the latter at 28 GHz and 3.5 GHz, according to ZDNet. The goal is to evolve into 5G:\n\nThe technology, Multi-RAT Interworking, will allow faster commercialisation of 5G networks. Users of 4G networks will be able to switch back and forth between them as soon as 5G begins deployment.\n\nThe story says that the companies successfully tested in two scenarios involving a moving car. One was use of a 4G/5G handset. The other was streaming to a 360-degree virtual reality video.\n\nCenturyLink has made a lot of business moves recently. For instance, it is offering a guaranteed \"price for life\" to subscribers who don't change their service level or address.\n\nThe company is also working to expand its rural fiber footprint, according to The Colorado Business Journal. The site reports that the carrier is negotiating partnerships with communities on Colorado's western slope and at least one on the northern front range to bring fiber to areas that it previously thought were not financially viable.\n\nCenturyLink receives Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Connect America Fund subsidies to provide service in rural areas. Some areas do not qualify for the subsidies, however. The plan would be for the government of these municipalities to identify neighborhoods in which 30 percent to half of homes want services and are willing to put down a deposit.\n\nSprint, in conjunction with CyPhy Works, is using the Sprint Magic Box to provide network coverage via drone. The drone, which in essence is being used as an aerial small cell, is being upgraded and tested in Midlothian, Texas, according to Wireless Week. The goal is to use the approach to offer coverage during disasters or at large events such as concerts. The Magic Box was launched by Sprint in May. That device, manufactured by Airspan, is designed for homes and offices.\n\nThe Magic Boxes use Sprint's 2.5 GHz or 1.9 GHz spectrum to reach the carrier's macro network. They connect to a cell tower if it is in the device's proximity, a cell on wheels or satellite cell site on light truck (COW or SatCOLT).", "29 September 2017\n\nBrees: Saints will kneel before national anthem Sunday, then stand together\n\nExpect all parties to work to get Ajayi back to his Week 2 total of 122 rushing yards, especially in front of a friendly crowd.

So what exactly is this wireless charging? How do this work?\n\nWhat is wireless charging?\n\nWhen it comes to wireless charging, it uses magnetic induction and magnetic resonance. Wireless charging also needs a wire, but the wire is connected to a charging base instead of your phone, so you can just drop your phone onto it for charging. The charging space comes in various size and shapes. Having said that, you need to get the right spot on the back of your phone on the right spot on the base of the charger to make it work.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAs we mentioned above, this tech uses induction and resonance to transmit power signals between the two surface. Saying that these devices are designed to transmit current without having to touch each other.\n\nThe base of the charger is plugged into the power supply and has a transmitter coil, while the phone has receiver coil. When the current is passed, the base station sends a signal out, and when a receiver coil gets close enough, a resonance change happens in the signal. Thus, the signal is changed and the charge begins.\n\nThe battery in the smartphone is connected to the coil and the battery is charged using the energy induced by the magnetic field.\n\nSEE ALSO: How to access Blocked Websites from anywhere\n\nTalking about the powermat, Qi isn't the only charging standard as there are others including Powermat and Rezence. These use a different standard than Qi but the logic is the same. In this case, Qi-enabled phone won't charge on a Powermat base due to signal variations.\n\nOnePlus 5 32,999 Specs Competitors Images +42", "Our friends over at Samson have sent us their new Meteor Mic. For awhile now, we have been producing many of the Nerd Reactor Podcast with just my Samsung S II and my iPod Nano. With Samson's Meteor Mic, it's going to be nice to have an actual mic for a change. Now, let's take a look shall we.\n\nThe Samson Meteor Mic is definitely a damn, fine looking USB Mic. Its retractable legs make it easy to setup anywhere without the use of a mic stand. The mic has a slick chrome finish and sports a classic 1950s mic style look. On the front of the microphone, the Samson Meteor features an Adjustable Volume Control and Mute Button. On the back of the mic, there is a Headphone jack that allows the user to hear latency-free audio while recoding. At the very base of the mic, there is the standard 5/8 thread mount for attaching the mic to various mic stands and boom poles.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out, if you happen to be a fan of the Portal video game series from Valve, you may notice a distinct similarity between that of the Meteor Mic and Portal's Turrets.\n\nWhen it comes to USB mics, you shouldn't expect THX 5.1 surround sound quality. That being said, the Meteor Mic actually picks up sound quite well. The mic has a nice P-Pop block effect with a built-in windscreen, perfect for capturing conversions. Armed with 25mm diaphragm condenser, the mic gives16-Bit CD audio quality at 48kHz. The mic is definitely not studio quality, but if you are looking for a studio quality mic, expect to pay far much more.\n\nThe Samson Meteor Mic is a perfect mic for on-the-go recording. It's great for podcast recording, but is not best mic choice for recording instruments. The mic works well with both Mac and PC, and even works well on an iPpad with Garage Band. At the end of the day, it all comes down to what you're looking for in a mic. If you're looking for a mic to record a live opera or your band's jam session, this mic is probably not for you. If your looking for a good mic to start podcasting with or maybe do that A Milli freestyle you've always wanted to throw down, then the Samson Meteor Mic is probably the choice for you.\n\n-Large (25mm) diaphragm condenser\n\n-Flat frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz\n\n-CD quality, 16-bit, 44.1/48kHz resolution\n\n-Durable chrome-plated body\n\n-High-quality A/D and D/A convertors\n\n-Stereo 1/8-inch headphone jack for no latency monitoring\n\n-Headphone volume control with microphone mute switch", "Signal, arguably the world's most respected secure messaging app, plans to use the DRM (Digital Rights Management) secure enclave built into Intel's Skylake chips as a way of hiding away how people are connected.\n\nIt sounds esoteric, but it fixes an important privacy weakness that has dogged end-to-end encrypted messaging: users want to know who else they know that uses the same service. This requires that apps check who else among a person's contacts uses it by consulting a central \"social graph\" of how people are connected.\n\nThis is a privacy compromise because it means that while the service's own encryption stops it from reading your messages (or letting intelligence agencies that later ask for access to this data read them either) it can end up knowing a lot about who you know.\n\nSignal tries to counteract this by not maintaining its own centralised social graph but instead using yours: your address book.\n\nTo find out if someone you know uses Signal the app turns their number into a truncated SHA256 hash first, and matches it against a central directory of hashes (this is similar to the way that password authentication works.) Anyone intercepting the traffic or hacking the directory will see hashes rather than telephone numbers.\n\nThe only way for a hacker with stolen hashes to figure out what telephone numbers they've got is to guess. Guess a number, run it through the hashing algorithm and see if it matches one that you've stolen. If it doesn't match anything, guess another number, and another, and another... and so on until you find a match.\n\nThere is a problem with this scheme (to quote Signal's developers Open Whisper Systems) because the \"pre-image space\" for 10-digit numbers is small, \"inverting these hashes is basically a straightforward dictionary attack\", which is another way of saying that it's feasible for a computer to make guesses quickly and cheaply enough to compromise the security of the hashes.\n\nSignal doesn't keep any record of the lookups it's performed and allows you to satisfy yourself that it doesn't by giving you access to its source code:\n\n...if you trust the Signal service to be running the published server source code, then the Signal service has no durable knowledge of a user's social graph if it is hacked or subpoenaed.\n\nBut who's to say that it's the published server source code that's actually running on Signal's server rather than some version of it that's been modified by a hacker or the demands of an intelligence agency?\n\n...someone who hacks the Signal service could potentially modify the code so that it logs user contact discovery requests, or (although unlikely given present law) some government agency could show up and require us to change the service so that it logs contact discovery requests.\n\nOpen Whisper Systems' founder Moxie Marlinspike thinks the Software Guard Extension (SGX) instruction built into Intel chips as a secure enclave for Digital Rights Management (DRM) offers a way out of the problem, and has integrated it into a new Signal open source Beta.\n\nThis is similar to ARM's TrustZone technology that forms the basis of Samsung's Knox security system, but was designed with DRM-oriented features such as \"remote attestation\".\n\nRemote attestation is normally used by content providers to verify that you and I are running the software we are permitted to, software that will respect DRM restrictions, rather than something that can pirate the content it's playing.\n\nIn Signal's case this arrangement is inverted. The enclave is on its server rather than on your device and remote attestation allows you, the client, to attest that the server is running a squeaky clean copy of Signal's software.\n\nFurthermore, because the verified copy of Signal's software is running in an enclave, neither it nor the messages that pass between you and the enclave can be interfered with by other software on the server.\n\nA practical hurdle to this is SGX's 128MB RAM limit, which sounds like a lot of protected memory for a microprocessor but is nowhere near enough to hold a database that might contain billions of hashes.\n\nNot to mention:\n\nEven with encrypted RAM, the server OS can learn enough from observing memory access patterns ... to determine the plaintext values of the contacts the client transmitted!\n\nOpen Whisper Systems' solution is to perform \"a full linear scan across the entire data set of all registered users for every client contact submitted,\" which is to say access lots of hashes in the database so anyone with control of the OS can't detect a pattern.\n\nFor any sizable user base, this would be incredibly slow if it had to be done for every user, almost every time they connect to the service (messaging apps perform regular checks in case new users appear).\n\nTo avoid this turning into a computer science lecture, we'll sum up Marlinspike's proposed solution by saying that it is based around disordering the way hashes are stored within the hash table to make it harder to carry out surveillance on them.\n\nDoes any of this matter beyond this one app?\n\nUndoubtedly. Signal's user base is small but where Signal goes, other secure messaging apps have a habit of following, including as mentioned above, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger with their billion or more users. Since adopting Signal's underlying platform in 2016, both appear to be implementing its innovations over time.\n\nWe don't know whether this will include using server-side SGX enclaves, but if it does it could provoke a response from governments already questioning the use encrypted messaging.\n\nApp companies want to preserve user privacy for complex reasons we've written about before, including a desire not to turn into large-scale surveillance platforms for global governments in ways that might hurt their popularity.\n\nBut the bottom line is clear: losing access to address book metadata will not go down well with the powers that be.", "The gadget reviewer in me wanted to have the latest and greatest, but the iPhone X starts at $999, and that's a price threshold I'm not ready to cross. Plus I'm not yet ready to give up my fingerprint authentication in favor of Face ID. I'll be happy to let others be the guinea pigs for that technology. I use Apple Pay almost every day, so I'm not keen on anything getting in the way of those easy transactions.\n\nI was glad to see most of the technology inside the iPhone X is also inside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.\n\nI have never owned a smartphone with a screen larger than the 4.7-inch screen on my iPhone 6S, and I'm really into photography, so I decided now was the time to go with the 5.5-inch screen of the iPhone 8 Plus.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is the back of the phone, which is now made of glass. Previous years have seen the iPhone's back made of aluminum, but Apple decided to include wireless charging in the iPhone 8 and glass makes that possible.\n\nWireless charging is hardly new.\n\nSamsung, LG and Motorola all make handsets that have wireless charging, but now that Apple has thrown in with the Qi standard for wireless charging, hopefully we'll see some fancy new chargers or public charging stations at coffee shops and hotels. Apple also introduced a wireless charging pad that can charge an iPhone, Apple watch and AirPods all at the same time, but it won't be available until next year.\n\nFor now, iPhone 8 owners will have to buy a Qi charger from another company.\n\nI like Samsung's line of fast wireless chargers.\n\nRight now, iPhones capable of wireless charging can only take advantage of 5 watts of charging power (not very speedy). Apple says 7.5 watt (faster) charging is coming with a software update.\n\nSpeaking of fast, this is the first iPhone with fast charging, but you won't get it with the charger and cable included in the box.\n\nTo fast charge the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, you'll need a USB-C to Lightning cable and a USB charger that features Power Delivery. A quick check of Amazon shows several adapters from different companies that should be able to fast charge. You'll want to spend $20 for the official Apple cable. There are other brands, but early word is Apple's cable will provide the fastest charging.\n\nWith the faster charger and Apple cable you'll be able to charge the phone to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.\n\nIt was no secret Apple would be bumping the processor in the new iPhones. Every iPhone I can remember has had a better or faster processor than the previous model. This year it is called the A11 Bionic processor.\n\nApple started building its own processors five years ago, and they really have a speed advantage because they control the hardware and the software.\n\nApple has put the Bionic chip in both iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X. The term \"bionic\" really doesn't have a technical meaning -- it just sounds cool.\n\nEarly speed testing shows the A11 Bionic is faster than some of the low end Macbook Pros and they're much faster than any other phone currently on the market.\n\nThe A11 has six cores -- two high performance cores and four high efficiency cores. It also has the first Apple graphics processor. Every aspect of the iPhone 8's operation feels very snappy.\n\nThe iPhone 8s main cameras have 12-megapixel sensors that are larger and faster than last year's iPhone 7. Optical image stabilization works on still pictures and videos.\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus has dual cameras, one wide-angle (f/1.8) and one telephoto (f/2.8). They work together along with the new image sensor to form the best smartphone camera I've used."]}, "BASF": {"2017-09-28": ["Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused.

The market is segmented based on application (oilseeds and pulses, cereals and grains, fruits and vegetables) and types (conventional crops and GM crops).\n\nThe advances in the field of agriculture are growing at a faster pace with recent developments in R&D activities to create new glyphosate products to achieve high yield. These are expected to replace the existing conventional methods employed in agriculture more efficiently. Owing to such research and new products, the global glyphosate market is expected to grow. This can be attributed to the demand for glyphosate from the GM crop growers. The production of new innovative and green glyphosate will lessen its harmful environmental impact. This will further drive the adoption of glyphosate and subsequently foster the growth in global glyphosate market during the forecast period.\n\nTechnavio's chemicals and materials research analysts categorize the global glyphosate market into the following segments by regions:\n\nSouth Americas APAC North America Europe MEA\n\nLooking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report\n\nTechnavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.\n\nSouth Americas: largest glyphosate market\n\nSouth America will dominate the glyphosate market during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the advances in the latest crop protection technology and increased adoption of GM seeds and crops. Also, the agricultural sector is dependent on GM crops that are resistant to weedicides, which is also fostering the market growth.\n\n\"In South America, the significant demand for glyphosate will arise in Brazil and Argentina mainly because of the availability of arable land in these regions. In South America, soybean crops are regularly sprayed with glyphosate as they are glyphosate resistant and it becomes easier to eliminate weeds. Thus, the adoption glyphosate in this region is high,\" says Mohd Shakeel Iqbal, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on specialty chemicals.\n\nThis report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only: View market snapshot before purchasing\n\nBuy 1 Technavio report and get the second for 50% off.

Also, the demand for food has increased due to GDP growth and increased disposable income of individuals. To meet the growing food demand, GM crops and sustainable practices are adopted to achieve high yield. GM crops are designed to add nutritional value and lower the cost of production.\n\n\"In APAC, countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea are adopting GM crops. The growth in the glyphosate market is directly proportional to the growth in the GM market. Also, China is the leading producer of glyphosate in the world. The country alone has contributed to more than 30% of the world's total glyphosate production in 2016,\" adds Shakeel.\n\nGlyphosate market in North America\n\nNorth America is one of the most agriculturally advanced regions. In this region, the adoption rate of GM crops and seeds to achieve high yield is significant. The GM crops facilitate high yield in a limited area of the land. Also, the nutritional value of yields is much higher than the crops grown using conventional seeds. The implementation of glyphosate is higher in regions where GM seeds and crops are grown. With increasing adoption of the GM seeds, the growth in the adoption of glyphosate is expected to grow during the forecast period.\n\nHowever, the extensive use of glyphosate has influenced the spread of tolerant and resistant weeds in the US. Also, herbicide-tolerant crops negatively affect the market. However, with the increase in genetically engineered seeds and crops will influence the global glyphosate market during the forecast period.\n\nThe top vendors in the global glyphosate market highlighted in the report are:\n\nBayer BASF The Dow Chemical Company Monsanto Company Syngenta\n\nBrowse Related Reports:\n\nGlobal Oleochemicals Market 2017-2021 Global Acaricides Market 2017-2021 Global Toluene Diisocyanate Market 2017-2021\n\nAbout Technavio\n\nTechnavio is a leading global technology research and advisory company.

The market is estimated to grow significantly over the forecast period owing to shale revolution positively affecting the COFI market. Despite several existing rigs being decommissioned over the last few years, the industry has witnessed an increase in the overall petroleum production. This has given an impetus to the need for utilization of these chemicals in the upstream extraction sector.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160524/371361LOGO )\n\nThe existence and expansion of product pipelines have encouraged the utilization of these products to improve the productivity, minimize the throughput time and eliminate the bottlenecks during the various operations across the oil and gas value chain.\n\nAsphaltene inhibitors are anticipated to be the fastest growing segment over the upcoming years and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2017 to 2025. These products help to reduce the precipitation of asphaltenes, preserve the asset integrity of the flow lines and optimize the operations over the forecast period. The utility of these chemicals is predominant in the extraction and pipeline segments. The problems associated with the extraction and transportation of asphaltenic crude include pipeline deposition and wellbore plugging.

The eggs originated from poultry farms in Holland. Investigations into the illegal use of Fipronil on poultry farms have led to 180 big poultries being shut down. Millions of eggs and egg-based products like salads, sandwiches and mayonnaise have been pulled from supermarket shelves. So far Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Britain, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Denmark, Switzerland and Hongkong have found Fipronil in their eggs.\n\nFipronil is an insecticide not permitted for use around animals destined for consumption, or in any products destined for the human food chain. The effects of consuming it? Sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, weakness, and seizures. It can cause abnormalities of the thyroid, liver and kidneys, if consumed by humans. Since researchers found thyroid tumours in both male and female rats fed high doses, it has been classified as a \"possible human carcinogen\" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Scientists who fed Fipronil to rats found an increase in seizures. In another study, scientists found long-term exposure to fipronil affecting the reproductive ability of rats, less mating, reduced fertility, smaller litter size, and increased loss of pregnancy. Scientists also found decreased survival and delayed development in offspring.\n\nEarly investigation has shown that a company called Poultry Vision in Belgium bought fipronil from Romania, mixed it with DEGA -16, an approved cleaning product, and sold it to Chickfriend in Holland, who sold it to poultries as a pest control services. The most disconcerting part has been the ease with which two men - Martin van de Braak, and Mathijs IJzerman, owners of Chickfriend - were able to avoid scrutiny after offering a \"miracle cure\" for lice infestation in chickens. The Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) of fipronil in eggs is set at 0,005 mg/kg within the European Union, as is outlined in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament. The Dutch food and product safety board (NVWA) reported that one batch of eggs, originating from one poultry farm in the Netherlands, exceeded 0.72 mg/kg.\n\nPoultries that are badly run and never inspected by competent health inspectors, who come for more than just collecting bribes, suffer from mites. The red mite, also known as poultry mite, infests chickens, and turkeys. Heavy infestations of mites decrease reproductive potential in males, egg production in females, and weight gain in young birds; they can also cause anaemia and death. Other mites, such as the depluming mite, burrows into the base of feather shafts, causing intense irritation, feather pulling and skin lesions. Different mites attack different areas of the chicken: feather mite, scaly leg mite, tropical fowl mite. Chiggers, harvest mites, red bugs feed on skin cells and lymph. Heavily parasitized birds become droopy, refuse to eat, and may die from starvation and exhaustion. Using good sanitation practices are important to prevent a build up of mite populations. But most poultries prefer to use strong chemicals.\n\nIf eggs have fipronil in them , obviously the meat of the chickens will. If a pest infestation at a farm is treated with Fipronil, the animals' skin would absorb the insecticide. The Dutch food safety agency, the NVWA, officials are carrying out checks on chickens bred for meat.\n\nIs the use of fipronil in poultries new in spite of it being banned? No. Here is a blog from Greg O dated 11th May 2012:\n\n\"I'm a professor in the Los Angeles area and want to do a study on Fipronil (Frontline) in eggs. Frontline is a common medication for cats/dogs for the control of fleas. Many people use Frontline to control fleas and mites in their chicken flock, but it turns out, there's no data on whether the active ingredient (Fipronil) actually makes it into the eggs. ...Although Frontline is effective in Chickens, there's no data on whether it enters the blood and then the eggs... I'd like to study whether it gets into the eggs. Were you thinking of using Frontline on your flock this year? If so, please contact me at bodhiroc@gmail.com . I would ask to get some of your eggs before you give fipronil to your chickens and then for a period of weeks afterward (not every egg, just one every week or so). I'd promise to share my results with you and the entire LAUCE community.\" Why this fuss over eggs when Fipronil is being used in India on all our grains and vegetables ? Fipronil was developed by Rhone-Poulenc and placed on the market in 1993 under the US Patent No. US 5,232,940 B2. Since 2003, BASF holds the patent rights for fipronil-based products. It belongs to the phenylpyrazole chemical family. It is a white powder with a mouldy odour, used in a wide variety of pesticide products used to kill ants, beetles, cockroaches, fleas, ticks, termites, mole crickets, thrips, rootworms, weevils, stem borers, plant hoppers, leaf folders, gall midges, whorl maggots and moths.\n\nCome to India. We use Fipranol on everything we eat. Our insecticides, sold freely to illiterate farmers, contain fipranol to control stem borer insects and leaf folder insects in rice, early shoot borer pests in sugarcane and maize. We use it to control termites. We use it on golf courses, and commercial turf. We use it on chillies, fruit and cabbages.\n\nIn the home you use it on dogs and cats to control ticks. You are supposed to cover your mouth and eyes, use plastic gloves and put one drop on the neck of the dog, or spray below the hair. It is not to be rubbed in. No one can stroke the dog. It cannot be used on ill or aged animals. It has to be wrapped very carefully in layers of paper before being discarded so that it doesn't make the other trash toxic. My hospital has been using it on the dogs that people bring. This is our last resort because so many animals have become ill after its use. Many animals have gone into organ failure. I would not recommend it except in extreme cases. Frontntline TopSpot, Fiproguard, Flevox, and PetArmor, Shwanfiproplus, Fiprospurt, Flip Spray, Fipronil S-Methospene Spot On, Fiprovet Spray, Protektor Spray, are some pet products.\n\nIt is also used as Gel for cockroaches, called Care and Guard Cockroach Killer and Ranger.\n\nAgriculturally, under the trade name Regent, it is used on moths, butterflies, grasshoppers, locusts, beetles and thrips. Under the name Goliath and Nexa it is used for cockroach and ant control. Under the name Chipco Choice it is used for commercial lawn care, golf courses and cornfields. Under Adonis it is used for locust control. As Termidor, Ultrathor and Taurus, Combat Ant-Rid, Radiate it is used to control termites and ants. Its Indian names are Race, Fipgen for Weed Control, Fiprosik, CGent, Result, Prins, Fipscort, Officer, Fipro-C5, Getter, Replex, Prinol, Egent, V Guard, Himgent, Sharp, Glider, Recent, Quencher, Agent-5, Molgent, Farari, Agenda, Zoom, Balveer, Rider (which promotes itself as organic and natural), Agrican Fighter, Risent, Revolt, Bheem, Sultan, Rellington, Viper, Fipron, Aashirwaad, Fiprofort, Refree, Fiprofit.\n\nFipronil is not allowed for use on cattle and especially dairy cows. But, in India some fipronil based products openly advertise it for dairies. According to studies, lactating animals secrete fipronil through milk, leading to a steady poisoning of the human body. According to the WHO, it can damage the liver, thyroid glands and kidneys if ingested in large amounts over time.\n\nFipronil goes into the soil where it lasts for upto a year. It is highly toxic to fish, crustaceans and freshwater invertebrates, birds, honey bees, rabbits and chickens. Studies show that non-target insects are also affected (naturally since it is a poison) in field trials for specific pests. Bees are the first to be affected. In May 2003, the French Directorate-General of Food at the Ministry of Agriculture determined that a case of mass bee mortality observed in southern France was related to acute fipronil toxicity and decided to suspend the sale of crop protection products containing fipronil in France.\n\nFipronil is one of the chemicals blamed for the disappearance of bees. A 2013 report by the European Food Safety Authority identified fipronil as \"a high acute risk\" to honeybees when used as a seed treatment for maize and on July 16, 2013 the EU voted to ban its use on corn and sunflowers within the EU.\n\nIf Europe is having problems in supervising its food factories, can you imagine what is happening in India where FSSAI has no inspectors and no apparatus in which the law can be administered.\n\nHow did Europe catch the culprits so soon? In the European Union, every egg is stamped with a number. Consumers can retrace the country of origin and which farm the egg is from. The media have published lists of the numbers of contaminated eggs. In India, you have no idea where your eggs, meat or milk come from.\n\n(To join the animal welfare movement contact gandhim@nic.in , www.peopleforanimalsindia.org)", "Deutsche Bank AG set a \u20ac101.00 ($120.24) target price on Basf Se (ETR:BAS) in a research note released on Thursday.

All rights reserved", "Arkansas is on the verge of banning the use, during the growing season, of a Monsanto-backed weedkiller that has been blamed for damaging millions of acres of crops in neighboring farms this year.\n\nThe weedkiller is called DICAMBA. It can be sprayed on soybeans and cotton that have been genetically modified to tolerate it. But not all farmers plant those new seeds. And across the Midwest, farmers that don't use the herbicide are blaming their DICAMBA-spraying neighbors for widespread damage to their crops -- and increasingly, to wild vegetation.\n\n(David Wildy, a prominent Arkansas farmer, in a field of soybeans that were damaged by DICAMBA. He says that \"farmers need this technology. But right is right and wrong is wrong. And when you let a technology, a pesticide or whatever, get on your neighbor, it's not right. We can't do that.\")\n\nThe issue has driven a wedge through farming communities in the Midwest, straining friendships and turning neighbors into adversaries.\n\nMonsanto turned to DICAMBA because many weeds have evolved resistance to the company's earlier weed-killing weapon of choice, glyphosate, also known as Roundup. Increasingly, Roundup no longer gets rid of farmers' most troublesome weeds.\n\nDICAMBA is an old herbicide, but it's now being used much more widely, in combination with a new generation of genetically modified, DICAMBA-tolerant crops. It's also being widely used, for the first time, in the heat of summer, which makes the herbicide more prone to \"volatilizing\" -- turning into a vapor and drifting in unpredictable directions.\n\nThis was the first year that farmers were allowed to spray it on soybean and cotton fields. (Some farmers did use dicamba illegally last year, provoking disputes between farmers that in one case, led to murder.) Many farmers embraced the new tool. But it quickly turned controversial: Farmers couldn't seem to keep DICAMBA confined to their own fields.\n\nThe problem was worst in Arkansas, where almost 1,000 farmers filed formal complaints of damage caused by drifting DICAMBA. But the rogue weedkiller has hit fields across soybean-growing areas from Mississippi to Minnesota.\n\nAccording to estimates compiled by weed scientist Kevin Bradley at the University of Missouri, at least 3 million acres of crops have seen some injury. Most are soybeans that aren't resistant to DICAMBA, but vegetable crops like watermelons, fruit trees and wild vegetation have been injured as well. The DICAMBA vapors didn't typically kill the plants but left behind curled leaves and sometimes stunted plants.\n\n\"There is no precedent for what we've seen this year,\" says Bob Scott, a weed specialist with the University of Arkansas.\n\n(Ty Vaughn, a top Monsanto executive, speaking to the Arkansas State Plant Board meeting this week)\n\nThe Arkansas State Plant Board now has taken the lead in cracking down on the problem. On Thursday, it voted unanimously to ban the use of dicamba on the state's crops from mid-April until November. This amounts to a ban on the use of DICAMBA in combination with Monsanto's genetically engineered crops. It's not a final decision: The governor and a group of legislative leaders have to sign off on the Plant Board's regulatory decisions, but they usually do so. That won't happen, however, until after a public hearing set for Nov. 8.\n\nThe board also approved a steep increase in fines -- up to $25,000 -- for farmers who use DICAMBA and similar herbicides illegally.\n\nMonsanto insists that its version of DICAMBA, which the company has mixed with an additive that's supposed to make it less volatile, does not drift from the fields where it is sprayed if farmers use it correctly. The company sent a delegation of five people, including Ty Vaughn, a top executive, to this week's meeting of the Plant Board. They passed out binders and thumb drives filled with data from the company's own tests -- tests that convinced the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to approve the chemical on crops.\n\nVaughn told the board that most of the damage from DICAMBA comes from farmers not understanding or following the rules for using it properly. \"There's going to be a learning curve,\" he said. \"It behooves all of us to continue to learn, and work toward solutions. I hope that's the goal of everybody in the conversation.\"\n\nFor Monsanto, a lot of money is at stake -- potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. Nationwide, Monsanto sold enough DICAMBA-tolerant soybeans to cover 20 million acres this year, and the company expects that number to rise.\n\nBut Monsanto may have underestimated the backlash against DICAMBA in Arkansas. The Plant Board was convinced by field experiments carried out this summer by researchers at the University of Arkansas and other universities. Those tests showed that DICAMBA -- even new formulations created by Monsanto and another chemical company, BASF -- does vaporize and spread across the landscape.\n\nDavid Wildy, a prominent farmer in Manila, Ark., who served on a state-appointed task force that recommended the ban on DICAMBA use on crops, says that \"farmers need this technology.

Off with your head is the Trump/Pruitt/Zinke overriding approach to science, thus leaving America's best and brightest in a vortex of perpetual bewilderment.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to bullying scientists, Trump's henchmen ignore science but approve risks of toxicity to America's golfers! Here's what's happened: It's all about chlorpyrifos, originally designed as a wartime nerve agent by the Nazis, which is sprayed on golf courses as a pesticide and recently A-Okayed/thumbs-up by anti-EPA guru Scott Pruitt. Contrarily, it was resoundingly thumbs down by the previous EPA administration -- ugly details to follow.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration's continual reshuffling of senior level scientists in order to confuse and/or goad to quit is unprecedented ever since the confusing Jimmy Carter era. Dan Ashe, who led Fish and Wildlife Services for decades and closely watched every transition ever since Jimmy the peanut farmer, says: \"Anything at this scale is unprecedented.\"\n\nPredictably, whistle blowers emerge: Joel Clement, former director/highest ranking scientist of the Office of Policy Analysis at the Interior Department, recently wrote an opinion piece published in The Washington Post: \"I am a scientist, a policy expert, a civil servant and a worried citizen. Reluctantly, as of today, I am also a whistleblower on an administration that chooses silence over science.\"\n\nClement, a senior scientist, who prepared Alaskan communities for the onslaught of destructive climate change, has been transferred to an accounting job that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies. The irony is simply mouth-gapingly overwhelming beyond any and all comprehension! Unless, that is, it's a not-so-clever ploy to get him to quit and/or muzzle him.\n\nThe upshot: Clement's key position goes unfilled as the Trump administration 'flips the bird' at Alaskan native villages of Kivalina, Shishmaref, and Shaktoolik exposed to risk of melting into the Arctic Ocean. \"These Alaska Native villages are one superstorm from washing away....\"\n\nClement: \"Let's be honest: The Trump administration didn't think my years of science and policy experience were better suited to accounts receivable. It sidelined me in the hope that I would be quiet or quit. Born and raised in Maine, I was taught to work hard and speak truth to power. Trump and Zinke might kick me out of my office, but they can't keep me from speaking out. They might refuse to respond to the reality of climate change, but their abuse of power cannot go unanswered.\"\n\nRemarkably and unprecedented, National Geographic has created a serial article: According to the site: \"The stakes are enormous.\"\n\nTrump's hatchet job blows away the EPA, cutting the agency's budget by 31%. But, hold on here, stop and think about that: Isn't the EPA the most significant, relevant, successful agency of all time? Yes, it is.\n\nBefore EPA, Time magazine ran cover stories about Cleveland's Cuyahoga River on fire. It was 1969 and the Cuyahoga River was declared a fire hazard because of an oil-slickened feculent, grimy water surface. It caught fire 13 times and thus served as a real life real time lobby for creation of the EPA in 1970 and then passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Today, the Cuyahoga River water no longer burns.\n\nMetaphorically, the EPA is \"Mr. Clean,\" 100% crucial to the health of the nation for the past nearly 50 years.\n\nIn the olden days of the 1950s-60s the Potomac, Lake Erie, cesspools, Chesapeake Bay, and Hudson River disease, filth, and reprehensible odor, a legacy of industry without restrictions. Fortunately, the EPA came to the fore to rescue capitalism from itself.\n\nEven today, the EPA estimates that one-half of the country's rivers and streams have \"Impaired Waters,\" which means no swimming, no fishing. As such, the EPA's nearly 50-years remains a work-in-progress.\n\nIn the 1970s, LA's air was a brownish haze of smog that could be cut with a knife. Once again the EPA/Mr. Clean saved the day, putting teeth into the Clean Air Act in the late 1970s, adding regulatory weight to mandated reductions of polluting cars, factories, mills, and utilities. Nobody else, nobody other than EPA stood up to the chemical plants, steel mills, and auto manufactures to say: \"We can't breathe... clean it up or get out of Dodge.\"\n\nBack then, the US was headed for darkness, but the EPA brightened the country. In fact, the EPA's record of accomplishment in the face of horrendous industrial capitalistic damage to the environment is downright remarkable, as follows:\n\n\"The EPA has facts to back it up. Since 1970, the agency has reduced the six (6) most common air pollutants by more than 50 percent, reduced air toxins from large industrial sources by almost 70 percent, and eliminated the use of ozone-depleting chemicals And this progress was accomplished even as the country's GDP tripled, energy consumption increased by 50 percent, and vehicle use nearly doubled\". No other governmental agency has such a strong record of achievement.\n\nMr. Trump is horribly ill informed and fanatically ill advised. He should increase the EPA's budget, maybe double or triple. He will not make America Great again (assuming it ever was) without a strong, viable EPA. Rather, he'll fall on his own sword with deep cuts.\n\nAbsolutely remarkably, since 1992 the EPA has singularly been instrumental in saving American citizens $362B on utility bills in partnership with the Department of Energy's Energy Star Program, promoting creation of efficient product development. That's an amazing feat and worthy of increasing the EPA's budget. They're more than paying their own way.\n\nNevertheless, according to a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute, Trump/Pruitt's EPA will cut 3,200 jobs and $2.7B in funding, thereby ending the EPA's Lead-Risk Reduction (FU Flint) and Radon Detection programs and cut Superfund cleanups as well as slash major programs aimed at cleaning up and restoring the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Puget Sound, crucial, iconic American natural resources. The EPA is going backwards.\n\nA comprehensive review of Trump's executive orders and departmental changes is simply overwhelming, thus serving an ulterior motive of public confusion.\n\nFor example, anti-EPA administrator Scott Pruitt blatantly ignored advice by his own EPA chemical safety experts and rejected a petition to ban \"all use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos.\" The chemical is already banned from household use, but it is still used on 40,000 farms and on golf courses (hmm). Research indicates that even low exposure may cause brain damage. However, Dow Chemical says it is safe when properly used. What is going on here? Is there a Parkinson's thread? A cancer thread? An Alzheimer's thread? No thread at all? Nobody knows for sure, yet years of study say it negatively impacts the brain and should be banned. That's what science says.\n\nChlorpyrifos, a Nazi wartime nerve agent, is an insecticide that stops nerve cells from firing without stopping. If the enzyme is blocked, the nerves don't send normal signals, and the nervous system fails. It is used in agriculture and on golf courses to kill pests. It kills living things. Okay, so approve it, according to Pruitt.\n\nChlorpyrifos is no longer patent protected. It is now the active ingredient in dozens of pesticide products made by companies such as Bayer and BASF. More than 80,000 people have submitted comments to the EPA urging the agency to ban chlorpyrifos from use on all crops immediately.\n\nTrump should be notified that his own EPA administrator, aka: Anti-EPA guru Pruitt, by going against his own agency's science, is exposing the president to a chemical that scientists claim is harmful, maybe Alzheimer's, who knows? Alzheimer's is only a speculation, but chlorpyrifos is a nerve gas... right?\n\nOn March 31st an official EPA ban on \"all use of chlorprifos\" was scheduled to take effect. On that same day, luckily for Dow Chemical, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt intervened and determined it is not harmful. How else could he approve continued use? But, he did not offer any data to back up his determination. Whereas, in November 2016, after years of studies, EPA scientists said the insecticide poses unacceptable risk to humans when its residue is found in fruits, vegetables, and drinking water. That does not sound good.\n\nSubsequent to Pruitt's decision, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network of North America filed a motion in US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to \"force the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos,\" arguing that the agency has not presented any scientific research that justifies reversing its preliminary findings.\n\nBill Freese, a senior scientist with the Center for Food Safety, said of the reversal: \"Another example of the Trump administration's hostility to science, just like climate change denialism. All scientists who have looked at this agree that there is incredibly strong evidence that the neurological impacts are extremely strong, including reduced IQ and pervasive development disorders.\" This may help explain a lot about the goings-on at Capitol Hill.\n\n\"In February state legislators in Hawaii -- anticipating Pruitt's decision -- introduced a bill to ban chlorpyrifos in that state, where just last year 10 workers at a Syngenta GMO research station on Kauai were hospitalized due to chlorpyrifos exposure.\"\n\nAs for golfing, here's Billy Casper's toxic story from years ago: \"One year, in a tournament near Miami, I had to withdraw after thirty-six holes. The course had been heavily sprayed, and there was weed killer in the lake. When I got to the course for the third round, I couldn't hit a wedge shot thirty yards -- I didn't have enough strength. My eyes were bloodshot, my complexion was very ruddy, and my right hand was swollen from taking balls from the caddie. My doctor said it was acute pesticide poisoning.\"\n\nThe Journal News/Lohud (part of USA Today) carries a story about a lawsuit filed against chemical companies by Rich Walsh on behalf of his father, Thomas, who died of leukemia at 56 after working on Pennsylvania golf courses for 30 years. After one of his chemotherapy sessions, Rich told his father the doctor suspected pesticides caused his cancer.\n\nAnthony D'Amico, the attorney for Walsh, believes that, over time, pesticide lawsuits will be similar to the cases that connected both asbestos and cigarettes to millions of deaths. Meanwhile, Rich Walsh has received thousands of emails and Facebook messages from strangers that \"knew something was wrong.\"\n\nThis is likely a major-major story that is only just beginning. It does not have legs yet, but with Trump in the WH, it'll get there. Trump will likely make it big, very big for lots and lots of reasons, none of which he'll boast about at his incessant monotonous lowbrow campaign rallies.\n\nRobert Hunziker (MA, economic history, DePaul University) is a freelance writer and environmental journalist whose articles have been translated into foreign languages and appeared in over 50 journals, magazines, and sites worldwide.

All rights reserved", "FRANKFURT \u00e2\u0080\" President Donald Trump keeps criticizing Germany's trade surplus with the United States. Germans say their products are just better and people want to buy them.\n\nOne thing isn't in dispute: German companies sold 107 billion euros ($120 billion) worth of goods to U.S. customers last year. Going the other way, U.S. companies sold 58 billion euros ($65 billion) worth of stuff to Germany. The result: a German trade surplus of 49 billion euros ($55 billion).\n\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that \"we have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change.\" He also told EU officials that Germany was \"very bad\" on the trade question during his stop in Brussels last week.\n\nWhat's behind all this? Here's a look at Germany's trading relationship with the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\n___\n\nQ: Why does Germany sell so many goods in the United States?\n\nA: Germans, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, are quick to say that German companies just make better products. There's something to that, as anyone noting all the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche rides in well-heeled neighbourhoods will have to concede. Germany's export success also depends on less glamorous goods, often highly technical industrial equipment made by smaller firms that dominate global niche markets. They have a lot of practice at exporting and they're good at it.\n\nA: Despite concerns about the surplus there are benefits to businesses and workers in both countries from their close and longstanding business ties. Germany is the sixth-largest export market for the U.S.\n\nAlso, German companies often invest, hire and sell in the United States rather than exporting there. Around 600,000 people in the U.S. work for German companies, according to the German American Chambers of Commerce in New York. They include familiar corporate names such as chemical firm BASF, drug company Bayer, mobile communications provider T-Mobile USA, and food retailer Trader Joe's. Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz has a factory in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, while Volkswagen makes cars in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The BMW plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was in fact the largest single auto exporter, sending $9.5 billion worth of SUVs through the Port of Charleston to the rest of the world.\n\n___\n\nQ: Does Germany manipulate its currency to make its goods cheaper and gain advantage?\n\nA: Germany doesn't have a currency it can manipulate since it belongs to the 19-member euro currency union. Germany does, however, benefit from a recently weaker euro. The euro's fall has been in large part due to monetary stimulus by the European Central Bank. The ECB has printed more than 1.8 trillion euros and pumped them into the financial system to lift inflation and growth. Such monetary stimulus can weaken a currency, and the euro has slid from near $1.40 in May 2014 to $1.12 now.\n\nIf Germany had its own currency, it's likely the opposite would have happened. Countries that run large trade surpluses often see their currencies gain in value, making their goods more expensive for foreigners and eventually reducing the surplus. The International Monetary Fund said in 2016 that the country's real effective exchange rate is undervalued by 10-20 per cent.", "Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition.\n\nSix Canadian organizations were awarded yesterday in Toronto by the Global Compact Network Canada (GCNC) for their outstanding efforts to help advance action towards the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. The Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Her Honour the Honourable Elizabeth Dowdeswell gave the welcome and congratulatory remarks to all awarded organizations during the ceremony.\n\nThe Awards were announced and presented by Mrs. Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development and La Francophonie to winners in two categories - SME and Large Organizations. Winners in the SME category include: MScSM Program at University of Toronto, Operation Eyesight, and Enviro-Stewards. Winners in the Large Organizations category include: Frontera Energy, BASF, and University of Calgary.\n\nThe awarded organizations also presented their business case for the SDGs and the impacts of their efforts to the ceremony attendees, which consisted of senior business leaders and representatives from the top echelons of the Canadian government.\n\nDuring the ceremony, a special partnership between three GCNC participants, Global Affairs Canada (GAC), Teck Resources Limited (Teck), and Nutrition International was unveiled. The partnership is Zinc Alliance for Child Health (ZACH) and plans to reach millions of children with zinc treatments to help save lives in Senegal, Ethiopia, Kenya and Bangladesh.\n\nTo further highlight the theme of strategic partnership for greater impact, the Awards ceremony also hosted a panel discussion on partnerships with experts from Frontera Energy, Global Affairs Canada, and Agrium sharing their insights on the fundamentals of fruitful partnerships for the Canadian corporate sector.\n\nA recording of the panel and the event will be published on the GCNC website on October 2, 2017.\n\nAbout the SDG Awards 2017\n\nThe annual SDG Awards hosted by the Global Compact Network Canada (GCNC), the Canadian network of the United Nations Global Compact aims to recognize and help foster existing efforts by organizations to help advance action towards the 17 SDGs. The Awards also aims to highlight the business case for organizations to embed the SDGs to promote their adoption in Canada.\n\nThe GCNC hopes that the Awards can spark interest among organizations who are not currently embedding the SDGs by providing a platform for organizations to benchmark their initiatives and showcase best practice examples for others to follow.\n\nThe event is sponsored by Host Sponsor, Teck Resources; Bronze Sponsors Frontera Energy and Kinross Gold; Breakfast and Lunch Sponsor, Baker McKenzie.\n\n\"Often private sector organizations don't know where to start or how to explore options to embed the SDGs to their company's sustainability strategy, the SDG Awards provides a great opportunity for those companies to join the discussion and be part of one of the largest SDGs-related initiative in Canada. \" explains Helle Bank Jorgensen, President of the Global Compact Network Canada.\n\nDetails on the application and nomination process are available on the Global Compact Network Canada's website.

Off with your head is the Trump/Pruitt/Zinke overriding approach to science, thus leaving America's best and brightest in a vortex of perpetual bewilderment.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to bullying scientists, Trump's henchmen ignore science but approve risks of toxicity to America's golfers! Here's what's happened: It's all about chlorpyrifos, originally designed as a wartime nerve agent by the Nazis, which is sprayed on golf courses as a pesticide and recently A-Okayed/thumbs-up by anti-EPA guru Scott Pruitt. Contrarily, it was resoundingly thumbs down by the previous EPA administration- ugly details to follow.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration's continual reshuffling of senior-level scientists in order to confuse and/or goad to quit is unprecedented ever since the confusing Jimmy Carter era. Dan Ashe, who led Fish and Wildlife Services for decades and closely watched every transition ever since Jimmy the peanut farmer, says: \"Anything at this scale is unprecedented.\" (Source: Juliet Eilperin and Lisa Rein, Zinke Moving Dozens of Senior Interior Department Officials in Shake-Up, The Washington Post, June 16, 2017)\n\nPredictably, whistleblowers emerge: Joel Clement, former director/highest ranking scientist of the Office of Policy Analysis at the Interior Department, recently wrote an opinion piece published in The Washington Post: \"I am a scientist, a policy expert, a civil servant and a worried citizen. Reluctantly, as of today, I am also a whistleblower on an administration that chooses silence over science.\" (Source: Joel Clement, I'm a Scientist. I'm Blowing the Whistle on the Trump Administration,\" The Washington Post, July 19, 2017)\n\nClement, a senior scientist, who prepared Alaskan communities for the onslaught of destructive climate change, has been transferred to an accounting job that collects royalty checks from fossil fuel companies. The irony is simply mouth-gapingly overwhelming beyond any and all comprehension! Unless, that is, it's a not-so-clever ploy to get him to quit and/or muzzle him.\n\nThe upshot: Clement's key position goes unfilled as the Trump administration 'flips the bird' at Alaskan native villages of Kivalina, Shishmaref, and Shaktoolik exposed to the risk of melting into the Arctic Ocean. \"These Alaska Native villages are one superstorm from washing away....\" Ibid.\n\nClement: \"Let's be honest: The Trump administration didn't think my years of science and policy experience were better suited to accounts receivable. It sidelined me in the hope that I would be quiet or quit. Born and raised in Maine, I was taught to work hard and speak truth to power. Trump and Zinke might kick me out of my office, but they can't keep me from speaking out. They might refuse to respond to the reality of climate change, but their abuse of power cannot go unanswered,\" Ibid.\n\nRemarkably and unprecedented, National Geographic has created a serial article: \"A Running List of How Trump Is Changing the Environment,\" by Michael Greshko, et al, National Geographic, August 23, 2017. According to the site: \"The stakes are enormous.\"\n\nTrump's hatchet job blows away the EPA, cutting the agency's budget by 31%. But, hold on here, stop and think about that: Isn't the EPA the most significant, relevant, successful agency of all time? Yes, it is.\n\nBefore EPA, Time magazine ran cover stories about Cleveland's Cuyahoga River on fire. It was 1969 and the Cuyahoga River was declared a fire hazard because of an oil-slickened feculent, grimy water surface. It caught fire 13 times and thus served as a real-life real-time lobby for the creation of the EPA in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Today, the Cuyahoga River water no longer burns.\n\nMetaphorically, the EPA is \"Mr. Clean,\" 100% crucial to the health of the nation for the past nearly 50 years.\n\nIn the olden days of the 1950s-60s the Potomac, Lake Erie, cesspools, Chesapeake Bay, and Hudson River disease, filth, and reprehensible odor, a legacy of industry without restrictions. Fortunately, the EPA came to the fore to rescue capitalism from itself.\n\nEven today, the EPA estimates that one-half of the country's rivers and streams have \"Impaired Waters,\" which means no swimming, no fishing. As such, the EPA's nearly 50-years remains a work-in-progress.\n\nIn the 1970s, LA's air was a brownish haze of smog that could be cut with a knife. Once again the EPA/Mr. Clean saved the day, putting teeth into the Clean Air Act in the late 1970s, adding regulatory weight to mandated reductions of polluting cars, factories, mills, and utilities. Nobody else, nobody other than EPA stood up to the chemical plants, steel mills, and auto manufacturers to say: \"We can't breathe... clean it up or get out of Dodge.\"\n\nBack then, the US was headed for darkness, but the EPA brightened the country. In fact, the EPA's record of accomplishment in the face of horrendous industrial capitalistic damage to the environment is downright remarkable, as follows:\n\n\"The EPA has facts to back it up. Since 1970, the agency has reduced the six (6) most common air pollutants by more than 50 percent, reduced air toxins from large industrial sources by almost 70 percent, and eliminated the use of ozone-depleting chemicals And this progress was accomplished even as the country's GDP tripled, energy consumption increased by 50 percent, and vehicle use nearly doubled\" (Source: Andrew Small, Before the EPA, Our Cities Looked Like This, Climate Desk, Grist, March 4, 2017). No other governmental agency has such a strong record of achievement.\n\nMr. Trump is horribly ill-informed and fanatically ill-advised. He should increase the EPA's budget, maybe double or triple. He will not make America Great again (assuming it ever was) without a strong, viable EPA. Rather, he'll fall on his own sword with deep cuts.\n\nAbsolutely remarkably, since 1992 the EPA has singularly been instrumental in saving American citizens $362B on utility bills in partnership with the Department of Energy's Energy Star Program, promoting the creation of efficient product development. That's an amazing feat and worthy of increasing the EPA's budget. They're more than paying their own way.\n\nNevertheless, according to a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute, Trump/Pruitt's EPA will cut 3,200 jobs and $2.7B in funding, thereby ending the EPA's Lead-Risk Reduction (FU Flint) and Radon Detection programs and cut Superfund cleanups as well as slash major programs aimed at cleaning up and restoring the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Puget Sound, crucial, iconic American natural resources. The EPA is going backward.\n\nA comprehensive review of Trump's executive orders and departmental changes is simply overwhelming, thus serving an ulterior motive of public confusion.\n\nFor example, anti-EPA administrator Scott Pruitt blatantly ignored advice by his own EPA chemical safety experts and rejected a petition to ban \"all use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos.\" The chemical is already banned from household use, but it is still used on 40,000 farms and on golf courses (hmm). Research indicates that even low exposure may cause brain damage. However, Dow Chemical says it is safe when properly used. What is going on here? Is there a Parkinson's thread? A cancer thread? An Alzheimer's thread? No thread at all? Nobody knows for sure, yet years of the study say it negatively impacts the brain and should be banned. That's what science says.\n\nChlorpyrifos, a Nazi wartime nerve agent, is an insecticide that stops nerve cells from firing without stopping. If the enzyme is blocked, the nerves don't send normal signals, and the nervous system fails. It is used in agriculture and on golf courses to kill pests. It kills living things. Okay, so approve it, according to Pruitt.\n\nChlorpyrifos is no longer patent protected. It is now the active ingredient in dozens of pesticide products made by companies such as Bayer and BASF. More than 80,000 people have submitted comments to the EPA urging the agency to ban chlorpyrifos from use on all crops immediately. (Source: EPA Urged to Ban Widely-Used Pesticide Chlorpyrrifos, Environment News-Washington, DC, Jan. 5, 2016)\n\nTrump should be notified that his own EPA administrator, aka: Anti-EPA guru Pruitt, by going against his own agency's science, is exposing the president to a chemical that scientists claim is harmful, maybe Alzheimer's, who knows? Alzheimer's is only a speculation, but chlorpyrifos is a nerve gas... right?\n\nOn March 31st an official EPA ban on \"all use of chlorpyrifos\" was scheduled to take effect. On that same day, luckily for Dow Chemical, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt intervened and determined it is not harmful. How else could he approve continued use? But, he did not offer any data to back up his determination. Whereas, in November 2016, after years of studies, EPA scientists said the insecticide poses an unacceptable risk to humans when its residue is found in fruits, vegetables, and drinking water. That does not sound good.\n\nSubsequent to Pruitt's decision, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network of North America filed a motion in US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to \"force the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos,\" arguing that the agency has not presented any scientific research that justifies reversing its preliminary findings.\n\nBill Freese, a senior scientist with the Center for Food Safety, said of the reversal: \"Another example of the Trump administration's hostility to science, just like climate change denialism. All scientists who have looked at this agree that there is incredibly strong evidence that the neurological impacts are extremely strong, including reduced IQ and pervasive developmental disorders.\" (Source: Paul Koberstein, Pruitt's Rejection of Chlorpyrifos Ban Seems Based on Alternative Facts, Earth Island Journal, April 5, 2017) This may help explain a lot about the goings-on at Capitol Hill.\n\n\"In February state legislators in Hawaii -- anticipating Pruitt's decision -- introduced a bill to ban chlorpyrifos in that state, where just last year, 10 workers at a Syngenta GMO research station on Kauai were hospitalized due to chlorpyrifos exposure,\" Ibid.\n\nAs for golfing, here's Billy Casper's toxic story from years ago: \"One year, in a tournament near Miami, I had to withdraw after thirty-six holes. The course had been heavily sprayed, and there was weed killer in the lake. When I got to the course for the third round, I couldn't hit a wedge shot thirty yards -- I didn't have enough strength. My eyes were bloodshot, my complexion was very ruddy, and my right hand was swollen from taking balls from the caddie. My doctor said it was acute pesticide poisoning.\" (Source: Caroline Cox, Pesticides on Golf Courses: Mixing Toxins with Play? Journal of Pesticide Reform, vol. 11, no.3, fall 1991)\n\nThe Journal News/Lohud (part of USA Today) carries a story about a lawsuit filed against chemical companies by Rich Walsh on behalf of his father, Thomas, who died of leukemia at 56 after working on Pennsylvania golf courses for 30 years. After one of his chemotherapy sessions, Rich told his father the doctor suspected pesticides caused his cancer. (Source: David Robinson, How Dangerous Are All Those Pesticides? The Journal News/Lohud, July 31, 2017)\n\nAnthony D'Amico, the attorney for Walsh, believes that, over time, pesticide lawsuits will be similar to the cases that connected both asbestos and cigarettes to millions of deaths. Meanwhile, Rich Walsh has received thousands of emails and Facebook messages from strangers that \"knew something was wrong.\"\n\nThis is likely a major-major story that is only just beginning. It does not have legs yet, but with Trump in the WH, it'll get there. Trump will likely make it big, very big for lots and lots of reasons, none of which he'll boast about at his incessant monotonous lowbrow campaign rallies.", "Infoholic Research launches a research report on the Global High Temperature Silicon Market, covering the market landscape and dynamics, and providing forecasts through 2022.

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., was homeless with her mother and siblings in Defuniak Springs, Fla., after her parents divorced. Her family lived in an abandoned gas station for more than two years. Nick Oza/azcentral.com | The Republic\n\n1220 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nU.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is running for the Senate seat held by Jeff Flake, ending months of speculation about her political future and giving Democrats a top-tier fundraiser with experience on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a video announcing her bid,the Arizona Democrat recounts her upbringing in a family that fell from the middle class into homelessness. She made her way to Congress, Sinema says, with hard work and help from \"family, church and, sometimes, even the government.\"\n\n\"I really feel like I have a duty to serve and give back to this country, which has given so much to me,\" she said in an interview with The Arizona Republic. \"Working hard is all I know; it's who I am. I believe I'll be the hardest worker for Arizonans in the United States Senate.\"\n\nSinema, who has a reputation as an energetic problem-solver not focused on partisanship, said she intends to make her work on behalf of military veterans and cutting regulatory red tape for businesses core issues of her campaign.\n\n\"Our nation is facing a lot of problems right now, but we can fix these problems if we work together,\" Sinema says in the video. \"It's time to put our country ahead of party, ahead of politics. It's time to stop fighting and look for common ground.\"\n\nThe announcement echoes her frequent lament that \"Washington is broken.\" But she also brings a relatively slender list of legislative accomplishments in Congress, where gridlock has dominated since Sinema first won her House seat in 2012.\n\nFlake campaign spokesman Will Allison cast Sinema as too liberal for Arizona.\n\n\"From her time working on Ralph Nader's campaign to the state legislature to Congress, Kyrsten Sinema has always been out-of-touch with Arizona and she'll do anything to hide her progressive record,\" Allison said in a written statement.\n\nA seat in Democrats' sights\n\nShe has set her sights on unseating Flake, who is already battling former state Sen. Kelli Ward for the Republican nomination and trailing the GOP challenger in recent polls. But before that, Sinema faces attorney and community activist Deedra Abboud in the race for the Democratic nomination, as well as political unknowns Jim Moss of Globe and Richard Sherzan of Mesa.\n\nArizona Democrats, who haven't won a Senate race since 1988, will have to choose between candidates like Abboud, a novice whoembraces progressive policies, and Sinema, who has won three terms in the House, in part by working with Republicans.\n\nDemocrats nationally see Flake's seat as a key opportunity in an otherwise dreary Senate map for the left in 2018.\n\nSinema is among the top fundraisers in the House, adding new financial pressure to Flake.\n\nWith Sinema vacating her congressional seat, the 9th District is expected to see more Republicans pursuing a seat that is considered competitive on paper but has been hers alone since it was created.\n\nOne recent poll suggests she could win the Senate seat. Phoenix Republican consulting firm HighGround Public Affairs found Ward leading Flake by 14 percentage points in the GOP primary and Sinema leading Flake by 8 percentage points in a general election matchup.\n\nIt's a political squeeze similar to the one Sen. John McCain faced in 2015, when he battled Ward to his right and then-U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, another moderate Democrat, whom he soundly defeated last year.\n\nOpposed 'Obamacare' repeal\n\nSo far this year, Sinema has voted in line with the Trump administration's known preferences 49 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. By that measure, she is the third-most GOP-friendly Democrat so far this year.\n\nBy contrast, Flake has voted with the administration 92 percent of the time. Seven of the other 51 Republicans in the Senate have lower marks, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\nHer proudest legislative accomplishment to date is passage last year of a measure to require the VA to accommodate veterans needing mental health assistance, even if their work involved classified information that needs special handling. It is named for Daniel Somers, a Phoenix Iraq War veteran who said he killed himself after hitting roadblocks with the VA.\n\nSEE ALSO: The congresswoman who grew up in a gas station\n\nSome Democrats have complained that Sinema has been too eager to support law enforcement bills that would make life more difficult for immigrants. At the same time, she has been outspoken in her support of \"dreamers,\" immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nWhile Sinema has frequently supported the current GOP agenda, she did not vote for the health care reforms that are arguably the most divisive and high-profile legislation of the Trump era.\n\nSinema has made reforms for the VA hospitals and improved economic opportunities for those with military ties a centerpiece of her time in Congress, though the hospital system remains in a state of upheaval three years after The Arizona Republic uncovered widespread problems in Phoenix.\n\nEarlier this month, Sinema met with President Donald Trump as part of a bipartisan group of House moderates seeking common ground on issues ranging from accommodating \"dreamers,\" and enacting temporary measures to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, to sweeping tax changes. Such bipartisan meetings have become a rarity in Washington and her presence speaks to Sinema's reputation as a Democrat that Republicans can work with.\n\nSinema co-sponsored this year a bill to better connect business startups with investors by cutting regulatory requirements. That measure is pending in the Senate. A member of the House Financial Services Committee, she is generally supportive of cutting taxes and of the kind of public-private infrastructure plan sketched out by the Trump administration, though she also cites concerns about the government's growing national debt.\n\nTALKING POLITICS: Listen to our Arizona politics podcast, The Gaggle, on Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud, Stitcher or Google Play.\n\nBipartisan reputation\n\nSinema has occasionally frustrated Democrats with what she sees as a need for moderation. She has declined to vote for Nancy Pelosi as her party's leader in the House. She also skipped a Tempe rally for Hillary Clinton at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nShe is friendly with Republicans in the House, including Arizonans like former Rep. Matt Salmon and his successor, Rep. Andy Biggs, both of whom are among the most conservative members of the GOP.\n\nSinema frequently cosponsors Republican bills, enough to make her the third-most bipartisan member of the House and the fourth-most conservative Democrat in the Congress that ended in 2016, according to GovTrack, a nonpartisan organization that monitors congressional activity. She was near the bottom of House sophomores at attracting influential cosponsors to her own bills, GovTrack found.\n\nSinema's bipartisanship extends to social media, where she routinely passes along birthday wishes to colleagues in both parties.\n\nBut the National Republican Senatorial Committee signaled in a statement Thursday that Republicans will attempt to cast Sinema as \"extreme.\"\n\n\"Kyrsten Sinema has more in common with the failed, radical leadership of Nancy Pelosi than she does with Arizonan families, and her track record of voting in lockstep with Washington Democrats will haunt her uphill campaign for Senate,\" NRSC Communications Director Katie Martin said in a statement.\n\nA prolific fundraiser\n\nOne thing that is not expected to be a problem for Sinema is money.\n\nShe is one of the more prolific fundraisers in Washington. Through June she had amassed $3.2 million in campaign cash, which was one of the largest sums in the House and topped the $3 million that Flake had raised by then.\n\nHer fundraising at least briefly posed a problem earlier this year when The Republic noted she accepted contributions from the embattled founders of Backpage.com, a website accused of knowingly accepting ads offering sex with underage girls.\n\nSinema eventually gave the money, about $53,000, to a charity to combat sexual abuse, but only after other charities rejected what they viewed as tainted cash.\n\nFlake and McCain helped keep pressure on Backpage this summer by introducing a bill to make it easier to prosecute online publishers aiding in sex trafficking.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSETHE GAGGLE: TALKING POLITICS EVERY WEEK WITH THE AZCENTRAL.COM TEAM The Gaggle: Russia hack, another ACA repeal | 4:56\n\nThe Republic's political team talks about President DonalTrump blaming Sen.

The scams vary in theme but have similar intent: to convince people that a legitimate business or government organization requires them to pay money as soon as possible.\n\nThe police department described several of the financial fraud crimes in a warning Thursday morning, detailing the \"creative\" approaches that criminals can take to rob \"our most vulnerable citizens,\" noting that the elderly are often targets because they can be more trusting or willing to listen to strangers posing as people they are not. Many financial scams are conducted over the phone, but some, including recent ones in Chicago, can be in person.\n\nIn one fraud, called the \"Sweepstakes Fraud,\" police say someone will call and say that you won money or a prize in a sweepstakes, but that you will have to pay for taxes, insurance or shipping and handling fees in order to collect the prize. As the police note, a true sweepstakes would not require the winner to pay anything.\n\nOne instance of the sweepstakes fraud getting someone in Chicago took place on Sept. 26 in North Edgewater. In that incident, an 89-year-old woman was contacted by phone and told she won a 3 million dollar sweepstakes. She was told she first needed to wire money from her bank to Indiana. This happened repeatedly, at least five times since May 2017, before she reported it to the police. The woman said the caller defrauded a large sum of money from her.\n\nIn another type of fraud, known as \"Lottery Fraud,\" a scammer can approach a person on the street and present to them what looks like a winning lottery ticket. The scammer will then ask for help cashing the ticket, saying they don't have a bank account or that they are not in the country legally and therefore can't claim their winnings. On Aug. 21 at 3:30 p.m. in Back-of-the-Yards, a 51-year-old man was approached by two Latino men, one who was 55-65 years old, the other who was 65-75 years old, in a black SUV. The older men approach the man and told him they had a winning Lottery ticket they couldn't cash without his help. The man ended up giving them \"a large sum of money,\" and then the scammers came up with an excuse to take off with his money.\n\nAnother scam, the \"Grandparent Scam,\" was reported on Sept. 12 in Portage Park. In this scam, a caller typically pretends to be a grandchild or another family member, and claims they urgently need money because they were in an accident and need help paying bills, or that they were arrested and need money for bail. Sometimes the caller claims to be calling on behalf of the child, either as a criminal justice official requesting bail money or as a hospital personnel. Typically the caller will request money to be sent through Western Union or Money Gram, according to police (note that a legitimate hospital or court system would not request money like this).\n\nIn the Sept. 12 incident, a 77-year-old woman was contacted by the phone and told her son was in jail. She agreed to meet with the caller and provide a large sum of money for bail. The caller was a white, 20-25 year-old woman, who met with her and took her money. The young woman later re-contacted the woman and asked for more money a second time. She did this again a third time, but the elderly woman did not have any more money to give, prompting the scammer to stop calling.\n\nIn a fourth scam, known as the \"Computer Virus Scam,\" a caller will pretend to represent a computer company such as Apple or Microsoft, and claim that the recipients computer or account has been hacked. The caller then offers to remotely fix the problem, for a fee, then ask for credit card or bank information. This happened on Sept. 5 at 3 p.m. in the Gold Coast. In this incident, an 82-year-old man received a phone call from an unknown person claiming to represent a cell service and internet provider. The man was told that if he wanted to prevent hacking, he needed to purchase gift cards and then call back with the gift card number and pin.\n\nPolice say that there are several ways to protect yourself from these types of scams. Chief among them: Never give out your credit card or bank information to anyone you don't know, and if you do, contact your bank or credit card company immediately to cancel the payments or freeze the accounts. Police also say you should never agree to meet with anyone who might be scammer, and to call 911 immediately and report what happened in as much detail as possible. Finally, if you are a senior citizen and you think you've been contacted by a scammer, police suggest you contact another family member or a trusted friend for help in addition to contacting law enforcement.", "Imagine unlocking devices, withdrawing money from an ATM, and even entering your building all without having to prove who you are. Now, imagine a world where everyone from your landlord to your bank and phone carrier know the size and shape of your heart. Using electrocardiography, researchers at the University of Buffalo have developed a cardiac scanning software that could turn your heart into such a key. And they have plans for the tech far beyond just unlocking your iPhone.\n\nThe \"cardiac scan\" prototype, described in a paper to be presented at MobiCom next month, uses doppler radar to make three cardiological measurements: heart rate (the frequency of your heartbeats), heart shape (the geometric shape of your heart) and finally, heart motion, the 3D movements of your heart as it beats. After scanning a heart for the first time -- a process that takes about eight seconds -- the paper's authors claim the prototype achieved an equal error rate (a standard performance metric for biometric systems) of 4.42 percent when given to four cardiac cycles for recognition.\n\nSimilar to face recognition, the cardiac scanner compares the heart data of the user to information stored within the device. If it matches, the device then unlocks, without the user having to do anything else. According to Wenyao Xu, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Buffalo, this system promises \"continuous authentication,\" meaning, once registered, users would ideally never have to log into their device again.\n\n\"Continuous and remote authentication is the dream of this community,\" Xu told Gizmodo. \"We really want to know who people are [up to] 500 meters away. The current convention is to use face detection or recognition, but this [cardiac scanning technology] is the first time to bring truly hard biometrics from the remote sensing perspective.\"\n\nXu is already looking past Apple and Samsung's much hyped face recognition software. As he notes, biometrics have been faked before: photographs can confuse face recognition software and 3D printers can outsmart fingerprint scanners. But, while the iPhone X can seemingly be unlocked by another user pointing your own phone at your face, cardiac scans are continuous and lock out users who don't match the pre-registered heart data.\n\n\"If we talk with someone, then they know our face. If we touch something, then hand it over, then they get our fingerprints,\" said Xu. \"So, the fingerprint and the face are not secure. But, as for the heart and the heart shape: it is invisible, it's more secure, and also has liveness detection technology.\"\n\n\"If people don't want to identify themselves, they can wear a scarf, hat or sunglasses to [hide] their identity,\" he continued. \"But with the heart scan, there's no way to escape. Everyone is naked under this radar sensor.\"\n\nIn its white paper explaining FaceID, Apple promises to restrict users' face data only to their devices, only transferring them to Apple servers with their explicit permission. Xu wants these same limitations on stored heart data, plus restrictions on the scanning radar's range.\n\nThis is crucial, given the research team's next steps: a second, more robust study with over 5,000 subjects (the initial paper used 82 subjects) before shopping the tech to major vendors like Microsoft, Apple and commercial airports. Eventually, Xu envisions a post-password, post-login world of instantaneous authentication. That ideal world where unlocking phones, withdrawing cash, and checking into airports is all done without having to prove who you are. If you're willing to give up that data, of course.\n\n\"One thing I can foresee once this technology is adopted is we don't need the login screen anymore,\" he says. \"It could replace traditional security checks in airports [and] can be integrated into any system that has a keyboard.\"\n\nBut the chief concern surrounding biometrics isn't how the technology operates in isolation, it's how it compounds with other technologies. Face recognition, for example, has been combined with predictive technology to extrapolate someone's \"likelihood\" of committing a crime or whether they're gay or straight. In 2016, Wal Mart filed patents to surreptitiously monitor customers' heart rate as they shop to track customer satisfaction, basically monetizing their biometric data. Does this new approach take us down a dark path of invasive, ever-present biometric surveillance? Or have we already arrived?", "Image: Apple\n\nDespite investing heavily in hardware and revising the operating system, the Apple Watch is losing apps from high profile businesses. This week, Twitter joined the exodus with Google, Amazon, Target, TripAdvisor abandoning the platform recently. Why is this?\n\nUnlike the iPhone and iPad, which resolved usability issues, the Apple Watch has never had the same obvious use-case. The main use-cases for smartwatches have centred on notifications and health. But, if you're anything like me, the first thing you do when setting up a smart watch is to turn off a bunch of notifications. Otherwise you end up with your wrist pinging and vibrating constantly.\n\nWhen you look at the apps that are being killed off, they are primarily focussed on notifications that are duplicating functionality that already exists on other devices. Why would I want my watch to tell me something that I can get on my smartphone more with greater clarity and easier interactivity?\n\nI suspect this is why Apple is investing in longer-term platform plays such as HealthKit and ResearchKit. We can see some of what Apple is planning through enhancements in watchOS 4 such as alerts when your heart rate falls outside certain limits in specific circumstances.\n\nThe developers that are leaving the watchOS platform weren't adding any real value to users. So, it's not surprising that the apps are either not being downloaded or, once installed, rarely used. The developers that are creating popular watch apps are rethinking what an app needs to be.\n\nRather than just mimic notifications, they do on-board processing within the watch to deliver useful massaging.

But the nation's top communications regulator may have been making demands of Apple that are technically impossible to fulfill.\n\nIn his statement, Pai demanded that Apple (aapl) \"activate\" FM radio capabilities in iPhones so that people in areas where wireless networks have been knocked out due the hurricanes could at least get access to information about disasters on the radio.\n\n\"I am asking Apple to activate the FM chips that are in its iPhones,\" Pai said. \"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first.\"\n\nThe problem is that models of the iPhone 7 and new iPhone 8 don't have FM chips that can be activated, according to Apple. \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products,\" the company said in a statement to the site Macrumors.com.\n\nAnd earlier models that have the chip don't have antennas to pick up FM radio signals nor the capability to be activated by Apple, according to sources who spoke to Apple columnist John Gruber.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.\n\nWireless networks in many areas were knocked out of commission by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The FCC said this week that 91% of the wireless network in Puerto Rico was still out, for example. After storms in prior years, the FCC held hearings to look into the repair efforts, but has not yet scheduled any following the recent storms. That prompted critical comments from FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. \"After Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy @FCC held hearings to address network recovery,\" Rosenworcel tweeted earlier this week. \"Why won't agency do it for Harvey, Irma & Maria?\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Pai responded, saying he had visited some areas hit by the disasters and been in contact with wireless carriers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, among others. While the FCC at some point will need to study what happened to better prepare for future emergencies, \"at this very moment...our primary focus must continue to be on recovery,\" he said.", "Half of millennials would give up their rights to get out of debt\n\nThe selfie craze stops at the voting booth, a Manhattan federal judge has ruled.\n\nJudge Kevin Castel has upheld a 126-year ban on photographs in Big Apple voting booths, saying he agrees with officials from \u200bthe state and \u200bcity \u200bElections \u200bBoard\u200bs\u200b who argued that photographs risk slowing the voting process and being used as evidence in voter intimidation schemes.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by three New Yorkers last year who claimed that their First \u200b\u200bAmendment rights were bring violated by the prohibition of photography in the ballot booth during the presidential election.\n\nIn court papers, they cited the fact that Donald Trump's son Eric, who they called \"a New York voter,\" had tweeted a photo of his ballot on election day.\n\nBut Judge Castel rejected arguments that voters need to share photographic evidence of how they vote on social media, saying that the risks of doing this outweighs the rewards.\n\n\"Some voters will require multiple photographs to capture their ballot along with themselves in different poses, or repeated photographs,\" the judge said. \"Long waiting times tend to suppress voter turnout.\"\n\nThe judge also sympathized with concerns that ballot selfies could be used in vote buying and voter intimidation schemes, including bosses demanding that workers present photographic evidence of how they cast their ballots.\n\n\"Preventing these evils and upholding the integrity of New York's elections is a compelling state interest,\" the judge said.", "(CBS) -- Here are ten new details about Apple's facial recognition feature which will be included on the iPhone X.\n\nIf you are curious about how to unlock your phone using Face ID or apprehensive about the feature, CBS News has some answers to your questions.\n\nFirst, it is advised that you do not let anyone under 13 years old use Face ID. Besides parental security concerns, it is difficult for machines to recognizes child faces, and therefore, Apple does not recommend them using it.\n\nEven if you use Face ID, you will still need a regular passcode which is required after restart or five false tries. This means that if your Face ID fails, you'll need to enter a passcode. You'll need a regular passcode to unlock the phone if it has been locked for 48 hours or to change the Face ID.\n\nFace ID needs your eyes open and pointed at the phone to unlock. However, Apple states that this can be changed in the phone's settings.\n\nThe facial recognition feature will work with \"scarves, hats, glasses, contact lenses and many sunglasses.\" However, Face ID should not work with photos or masks. Apple says that it protects against that type of spoofing.\n\nFace ID data is only stored on the iPhone's secure enclave chip.\n\nApple says that, for security purposes, the TrueDepth camera randomizes its scans and image-capturing and infrared dot pattern each time it's used. This is to prevent spoofing as well.\n\nPasswords and apps that use Touch ID will automatically be able to add Face ID authorization.\n\nBefore using Face ID with Apple Pay, you will have to double click the side button. CBS says this is how you indicate you want to buy something.\n\nApple won't use your face data unless you sign up for Face ID Diagnostics. You can request Face ID Diagnostics in the settings which shows a way that photos can be uploaded to Apple.

The deal, which followed months of tumultuous negotiations, will net Toshiba about $14 billion.\n\nToshiba has staked its future on the sale, with the proceeds earmarked to help repair the financial damage from a disastrous foray into nuclear power in the United States.

Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nIn an era when the global technology industry is dominated by nimble specialists selling cutting-edge design and software, Toshiba has been defined by a stultifying management hierarchy, a dogged focus on hardware, and a scattered portfolio of businesses.\n\n\"Toshiba is one of Japan's last zombies,\" said Jesper Koll, chief executive of WisdomTree Japan, an investment firm. \"It's the last of the big conglomerates that does not have a defined strategy.\"\n\nSimilar problems have hampered other Japanese groups, but Koll said Toshiba had been particularly slow to address them. Others, like Hitachi, another refrigerators-to-power-plants conglomerate, he said, \"made hard decisions\" to restructure and become more accountable to shareholders, while Toshiba delayed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen came an accounting scandal in 2015, in which Toshiba admitted overstating its earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years. Top company leaders resigned, and investigators hired by the company blamed \"a corporate culture where it is impossible to go against one's bosses' wishes.\"\n\nToshiba had been covering up cost overruns at its US nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric, which it bought amid an ill-timed expansion in 2006. Those losses later ballooned: Westinghouse sought bankruptcy protection in March, after costing Toshiba $6 billion in write-offs. Toshiba said it would stop building new nuclear power plants and focus on maintaining older ones.\n\nNow, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.\n\nThe company had been negotiating the sale for months, with a shifting roster of potential investors. The final list of buyers, disclosed in a statement Thursday, had some surprising omissions.\n\nTwo financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest later.\n\nThe investors were instead drawn from the private sector. In addition to Apple, they include US businesses Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data-storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.\n\nToshiba will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world's largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices. In negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.\n\nToshiba pioneered its core technology, NAND flash memory, and although it has fallen to second in global production, behind Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the business has generated the largest share of Toshiba's profits in recent years. Among the company's concerns was that its technology could fall into the hands of investors, like SK Hynix and Kingston, that are also competitors.\n\nJapan dominated chip making in the 1980s and 1990s but has lost ground. Tsugio Makimoto, a retired Hitachi engineer, said conglomerates were once good at nurturing chip businesses, because they had money for research and factories. But as change quickens, \"management speed and specialization are more important.\"", "GLOBAL: China's technology giants, including WeChat owner Tencent, e-commerce company Alibaba, and electronics manufacturer Huawei will overtake America's big five tech companies - Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - in the coming years, according to WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell.\n\nNo longer should western players be taken more seriously than their Chinese counterparts, Sorrell told delegates to Advertising Week in New York.\n\n\"Alibaba and Tencent are the ones you really have to watch out for. I think what they will do is expand,\" he said in remarks reported by Mumbrella.\n\n\"The west basically doesn't want China to succeed.

We want to outcompete them, but they are going to win.\"\n\nThe internet is growing everywhere, but China, with its enormous population and attendant tsunami of data, is moving even faster. If we think \"the speed of internet disruption is fast here,\" he said. \"look over there\".\n\n\"They will win the competitive battle. Tencent and Alibaba in particular - and Huawei.\"\n\nInterviewed onstage by New Yorker media critic Ken Aluetta, the chief executive of the world's biggest marketing communications group added that he had returned just two weeks ago from a trip to China.\n\n\"We saw 31 companies in ten days around the whole of China, getting a grip, mainly local companies.\"\n\nBut other companies have more visibility and more traction in the west already. Electronics manufacturer Huawei, which is primarily known for phones but is expanding to wearables, tablets, and now laptops, also caught Sorrell's eye.\n\nThe size of Huawei's Shenzhen workforce, around 200,000 people, is noteworthy; as is that of Alibaba - around 15,000.\n\nSorrell also believes the era of cheap copycat products is over. \"We think they steal technology? Well they may have done a few years ago. We could have said the same thing about the Japanese, the same thing about the Hong Kong Chinese and the South Koreans.\"\n\nFor the time being, the competition remains in Asian markets, but Sorrell believes it is a precursor of a larger trend to come. He noted the \"head-to-head battle\" between the Alibaba-owned Lazada platform and America's Amazon in Singapore. \"It's going to be very interesting to see who wins.\n\n\"They will start to penetrate the south east Asian markets, India and places like that and sweep that way, just like from a foreign policy point of view they swept that way and into Africa.\"\n\nSourced from Mumbrella; additional content by WARC staff", "Image: Google\n\nEven though it feels like we're still processing all of Apple's latest devices and announcements, it's time to switch gears and prepare for what's coming on the other side of of the smartphone divide.

That's where the Google Home mini comes in. With a smaller, cuter design, it should make for a decent alternative to anyone thinking about buying an Echo Dot.\n\nThere's also rumblings about something called the Google Home Max, which looks to counter the upcoming Apple HomePod with its own hi-fi speaker setup and built-in assistant.

The twist for 2017 is that the Pixelbook will be a 2-in-1 thanks to a 360-degree hinge, and that it will feature built-in handwriting recognition and even an $US99 optional Pixelbook Pen.

With the digital assistant wars in full swing, Google's best shot at countering all of the new Echo devices that Amazon just announced and stuff like the Siri-powered Apple Homepod is to put the Google Assistant in as many products and devices as it can.\n\nThere's also a chance we hear more or even get a released date for Google Lens, which is Google's visual recognition tech that can help you identify things like the species of a flower just by pointing your phone's camera at it. Google Lens was originally announced back at Google I/O 2017 and has been slated for integration into the Google Assistant and Google Photos, and with all the Google Assistant news as of late, it seems like a good time for Google to talk more about Google Lens.\n\nWATCH MORE: Tech News", "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. communications regulator urged Apple Inc to activate FM radio chips installed in iPhones that would allow Americans to get access to life-saving information when a natural disaster causes wireless networks to go down.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday that Apple was the one major phone manufacturer that has not activated the chips.\n\n\"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first,\" Pai said in a statement. \"I hope the company will reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\"\n\nAn Apple spokesman did not immediately comment on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, also said Apple should activate the chips.\n\n\"The bottom line is consumers need critical information in times of emergency,\" Nelson said in a statement. \"If technologies, such as radio chips, exist that will help do that during times of emergencies, then companies should be doing everything in their power to employ their use.\"\n\nNational Association of Broadcasters Chief Executive Officer Gordon Smith praised bipartisan backing for activating the chips. \"We urge Apple to acknowledge the public safety benefits of local broadcasting on SmartPhones and to light up the FM chip,\" Smith said in a statement.\n\nFCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, also backed the effort asking Apple to activate the chips.\n\nThe FCC said on Wednesday that more than 90 percent of cell sites in Puerto Rico and two-thirds of those in the U.S. Virgin Islands were out of service after hurricanes damaged them.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Von Ahn)\n\nSEARCH", "REUTERS - Shares of Roku Inc, a Fox-backed video streaming firm, rose as much as 16.6 percent in their market debut on Thursday, giving the U.S. IPO market a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nThe U.S. IPO market is struggling to finish 2017 on a high note even though it has already raked in more money so far this year than it did in 2016.

The Stockwell, the smallest in their lineup, has stood out as probably my favorite portable Bluetooth speaker to hit the market in several years.\n\nI've got something of an affinity towards Bluetooth speakers. I think they are one of the most ubiquitous products that nearly everyone has. Yet, I still haven't been able to touch upon one that I really felt was what I was looking for.\n\nMarshall really has a fine attention for detail that I haven't seen in this space in the past. Though I've tested dozens of Bluetooth speakers, Marshall has come closest to getting everything right.\n\nObviously, the Stockwell is a Bluetooth speaker. In Marshall's lineup of wired and wireless models, the Stockwell is the smallest of the group. That means it is also the quietest, though I don't think anyone would call it quiet.\n\nIn fact, it can put out an impressive 90db, which is one of the loudest in its size range. The sound is because of what is inside the speaker. Namely two 2.25-inch woofers and a two-channel Class D amplifier.\n\nOn the exterior, the speaker sports Marshall's iconic look with their recognizable logo emblazoned across the speaker grill that occupies the entirety of the front. The top of the unit is ripe with controls -- frequent fliers like power, Bluetooth, input and volume. Then others that are seldom seen, but that are handy, like bass and treble.\n\nThe buttons and knobs along the top are the nicest I've seen on a speaker. They aren't rubberized nubs that lack feedback and tactility. The knobs are metal, have diamond-pattern knurling and actually recede into the speaker itself. Press down and they spring up and allow you to adjust them. Press again to hide them inside the body for travel. It also prevents them from getting accidentally adjusted on you.\n\nThe whole top is a super elegant gold color to match the Marshall logo. I'll be the first to admit I hate the color gold, but it just works in this application.\n\nThe sublime build quality is not limited to just the buttons of the speaker.\n\nYou can see it come across in the aux cord and cover as well. The aux cord is included and has all the hallmarks of a premium cable. The ends are metal (and, of course, gold). They even have springs on the them, which helps reduce the pressure when bending the cables and protects them from damage. The cover, which is an \"optional\" accessory, is vinyl on the outside and a plush velvet on the inside. I put optional in quotes because technically you can buy it without it, but they are currently the same price on Amazon. So... just get it with the cover.\n\nThe battery inside the speaker is great, though not the longest we've ever seen. It will get you easily 25 hours of playback and I can verify I've seen actually a little bit more than that if I'm not pushing everything to its limits. Since you have all that great battery life inside of there, why not put it to use?\n\nOn the back is a USB port which you can use to charge your device on the go. It is exceptionally handy and something I wish other speaker manufacturers would implement.\n\nSubscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube\n\nThe battery itself is a 6,600mAh cell and took me about three hours to fully charge up using the included power adapter. It's a bit of a downside you have to use their included power adapter. On the plus side, however, it is a 60w charger that charges much quicker than those speakers that rely solely on USB.\n\nLike many other Bluetooth speakers on the market, you can use this for calls as well. If a call comes in while you are connected, you can hit the phone button to answer and chat right through the speaker. Tap it again to end the call and continue jamming.\n\nYou have two different inputs for this speaker, starting with the included aux cable and ending with Bluetooth. Marshall really spent time on the Bluetooth piece of the equation. To start, the range is far above average. I was able to keep connected far past where other speakers would normally drop off. Plus, they've opted for Bluetooth 4.0 and included support for aptX, an audio coding algorithm put out by Qualcomm.\n\nIt's only included on high-end speakers and headphones, and aims to drastically increase the audio quality when streamed over Bluetooth. Basically, it allows for nearly imperceptible difference when streaming vs wired. That is a significant thing to accomplish because many Bluetooth speakers suffer from degraded audio quality.\n\nYou also can't just claim to support aptX. Similar to Apple's MFi program, manufacturers must submit their products to Qualcomm to verify that their product meets the high standards of aptX.\n\nAll of that leads to sound, arguably the most important aspect of a speaker.\n\nPersonally, I feel audio quality can be a bit subjective. It also highly depends on the type of music you listen to. I tend to listen to a lot of 90's, classic rock and instrumental. Some pop music from today, but generally no rap or hip-hop. All of the genres I lean towards are well represented by the Stockwell.\n\naptX does a great job of keeping up audio quality (though iPhone doesn't support aptX).\n\nThere is no ambient hiss that is frequently seen from cheaper speakers. I appreciate the fact that when you turn the speaker down to 0 volume it actually mutes the speaker. Too many speakers we've reviewed just go very low when turned down all the way instead of muting. This is how a speaker should operate.\n\nOn the high end of things, the audio keeps from degrading until you get almost to the top. I was able to turn the Stockwell up to 100 percent and my iPhone up to just above 80 percent before I heard any deterioration in the sound quality.\n\nIn my real life testing, I've found that it was a great speaker for smaller parties. As many as 12-15 people could hang around talking with the music still being at good volume. I was also able to put it downstairs in the living room, stream content from my Apple TV, run upstairs and still hear the music cranking without a problem. It was even great outdoors although that's a different beast -- if you have large swaths of area to cover in audio, you'll need something beefier.\n\nIn listening to a large variety of music from several genres, I've found it to be most accurate in anything with instrumentals. That's going to be rock, jazz, metal, classical, etc. It did quite well with pop music (whether from the 90's or today) as well. Highs were pristine, with female vocals being an exceptional standout. High hats, cymbals and snares all were crisp, tight and accurate.\n\nMids were on point, too. Brass shines through fantastically, though they all were bright and energetic. Guitars and backing tracks all held their own, with very little muddling of the more delicate notes. I'd say the midrange is strongest and sometimes overpowering the lows.\n\nOn the low end, this was where the most mild of disappointments came in.\n\nIt isn't that the bass is bad, it can just be lacking at times. A lot of that just comes from the size of the speaker, which isn't entirely the Stockwell's fault. What was produced from the Stockwell was entirely accurate and a pleasure to hear. You can easily differentiate the notes on the bass, the backing track or the drums. This is where I can easily see people more interested in bass-heavy party/rap music would be let down.\n\nHonestly, it depends.\n\nIf you are someone who is interested in finding a great looking unique speaker with some great sound, this a great option. If you are looking for the absolute best sound, there will admittedly be others out there (though more expensive) that can fill that niche. It also is reliant on how important looks are vs sound.\n\nAre the 50/50? Or skewed, one way or another?\n\nMost importantly, if you love classic rock, vinyl, jazz, etc, you will probably love this speaker. Obviously it has the look of a vintage amp with one of the most recognizable company names, but it also has a sound tailor-made for that genre.\n\nIf we break down everything above into a condensed list, we have an overwhelming list of pros and a few minor cons.\n\nIn my personal path to finding the ultimate portable Bluetooth speaker, I had quite a list of features. Size, audio quality, battery life and some good aesthetics. What I didn't expect was that the Stockwell would meet all of this criteria, and them some. I was charmed by its retro vibe and couldn't be happier with the performance.\n\nI'm not a huge bass-heavy listener or into rap, so these shortcomings were immediately forgiven. I couldn't recommend the Marshall Stockwell enough as it makes me just more eager to investigate the rest of Marshall's Bluetooth speaker lineup.

Much of Ikea's furniture requires customers to screw together table legs, bed frames and dining room chairs.\n\nIkea said it tested TaskRabbit in its stores in London last year and plans to roll out the service in U.S. stores and more U.K. locations. More countries may be added later. Before the TaskRabbit deal, certain Ikea stores already provided some independent workers to assemble goods.\n\nIkea said it expects the deal to be completed next month, and that TaskRabbit will remain an independent company and stay based in San Francisco.

But growth is expected to slow sharply this quarter in the wake of a string of devastating hurricanes.\n\nThe April-June expansion in the gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services -- is up slightly from a 3 percent estimate made a month ago, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It is the strongest performance since the economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2015. The upward revision reflected larger farm stockpiles.\n\nThe year started with a lackluster 1.2 percent gain in the first quarter. Economists believe growth has slowed again to around 2 percent in the current quarter.\n\nThe revised figure was the government's third and final look at GDP for the April-June period, and left GDP rising at an average 2 percent pace over the first six months of the year. That matches the lackluster average annual growth rates seen since the recovery from the Great Recession began in mid-2009.\n\nAnalysts have been busy trimming their forecasts for the current July-September quarter to reflect the adverse effects of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that have hit in recent weeks. But many are optimistic that growth will bounce back quickly as rebuilding gets underway.\n\n-- From wire reports", "It's been a few months since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) updated investors regarding its Apple Music paid subscriber base, but the company has now done just that.

That's up from the 27 million in June, which translated into a $3.25 billion run rate for the service. Creative director Zane Lowe and head of content Larry Jackson also sat in for the interview.\n\nAlong with Spotify, which had 60 million paid subscribers as of July, Apple Music is helping drive the music industry's comeback. After decades of growth that peaked around 2000, the U.S. music industry suffered severe contraction over the following decade.

The first half of 2017 broke a record for most Google user data requests over a six-month period.\n\nBetween Jan. 1 and June 30, Google received 48,941 requests for data from 83,345 accounts from governments around the world. The company complied with 65 percent of them, meaning more than 54,000 accounts were affected by this.\n\nThat's 4,000 more requests than the same time period in 2016. The number of reported requests on Google have been steadily increasing since 2009, when the company's transparency reports began, except in 2014. The latest report sets an all-time high.\n\nMore and more governments are eyeing tech companies for information in their investigations and national security issues. The Department of Homeland Security has viewed social media as a tool to monitor immigrants, while police have seeked voice data from Amazon to help with a murder trial. Apple also reported an all-time high with its transparency report released on Thursday, showing that national security requests tripled since last year.\n\nTech companies like Google and Apple often release these transparency reports to let their users know how frequently government officials demand data from them. From these transparency reports, we can see that governments are interested in how people use their technology more than ever for Google.\n\nBecause of Google's massive ecosystem, these requests would mean handing over data on content like your Gmail messages, documents you've saved, videos watched on YouTube, or any web activity that falls under Google's umbrella.Google has argued against the US government for the right to disclose these requests, including a lawsuit in 2013 to fight gag orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nIn the first half of 2017, Google received up to 500 national security letters for up to 1,500 accounts. These are letters demanding information that don't need a judge's approval because they're signed by the FBI. Companies are only allowed to disclose how many of these letters they receive in intervals of 250, so there's no specific number for Google.\n\nGoogle is compelled to provide information to the US government under Section 702 of the FISA Amendment, legislation that is set to expire at the end of 2017. Google, along with Microsoft and Amazon, have called on politicians to change the internet surveillance bill.\n\n\"Government access laws are due for a fundamental realignment and update in light of the proliferation of technology, the very real security threats to people, and the expectations of privacy that Internet users have in their communications,\" Google said in a blog post alongside its transparency report.\n\nTags Security Privacy Google Government surveillance", "When Oracle meets for its annual shareholder meeting on November 17, the board of directors will vote to reject a shareholder proposal requesting that the company do a payroll audit to check for a gender pay gap.\n\nIn a filing with the Security and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the board -- made up of nine men and three women -- indicated that it would reject the proposal unanimously.\n\nGender wage gap audits have been increasingly common as tech companies feel pressure from both their employees and the US government to prove that their pay structures don't discriminate against women. Several studies have found that men in tech continue to make more money than women for doing the same work.\n\nOne of Oracle's largest competitors, Cisco, completed its own audit of US pay in August 2016. After looking for gaps along the lines of race and gender, the company ultimately made adjustments to 2% of its employees salaries, the total of which represented just 0.1% of the total US base payroll, the company said.\n\nSimilarly, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Intel, Expedia, Microsoft, and Adobe have all also released gender pay comparison metrics at the request of their shareholders.\n\nOracle's shareholder request was filed by shareholders Pax World Mutual Funds, which bills itself as a socially responsible mutual fund.\n\nThe proposal requests that Oracle perform an audit for a gender wage gap by April 2018, and present steps to resolve the gap should one be found. The proposal notes that women make up 29% of Oracle's employees, but only hold 23% of its leadership positions.\n\nHowever, in its statement rejecting the proposal, Oracle argued that it is already doing enough.\n\n\"Diversity and inclusion in our workforce starts at the top,\" Oracle wrote in its statement, citing one of its two CEOs, Safra Catz, as an example of strong female leadership at the company. It also highlights the board, which is 25% female, as an example of equality.\n\nIn case you were wondering, Katz and her male co-CEO Mark Hurd both earned the same base salary of $950,000 in Oracle's fiscal 2017. But Hurd's total compensation, including stock awards, of $40.8 million was $103,000 above Katz's total compensation.\n\nThe wage gap between two CEOs owes to costs and expenses for to Hurd's residential security.\n\n\"We make every effort to attract, invest in and develop the talents of employees who reflect the diversity of our customers and the communities in which we do business...We are also committed to pay equity for all of our employees and ensuring that we do not discriminate on the basis of gender or any protected category in the full range of our compensation decisions,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The board does not believe that this stockholder proposal would enhance Oracle's existing commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace,\" the statement says.\n\nWhile shareholder proposals are almost always voted down by companies, Oracle's rejection comes at a time when tech companies face increasing external pressure to prove that their companies are friendly to women.\n\nGoogle, for one, has been at the forefront of the conversation since the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit earlier this year demanding that the company turn over more information about how employees are compensated. Google claimed that its own internal audits showed no sign of a pay gap, and succeeded in convincing a judge that the Department of Labor was asking for too much internal data.", "US-tech giant Apple has written to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to discuss suggestions regarding the regulator's Do Not Disturb (DND) app, which the iphone maker had refused to have on its app store, citing privacy issues.\n\nThe Trai app allows users to report directly to the regulator pesky calls and unsolicited messages from telemarketers.\n\nAlthough Apple did not allow the app on its app store, Google's Android operating system supports it.\n\nTrai Chairman RS Sharma said, \"They have written to us and want to share some suggestions they have. We have invited them for talks.\"\n\nSharma has termed the step taken by Apple unreasonable and said that users have control of their data and should decide with whom the data could be shared.\n\nThe regulator has come up with a consultation paper on privacy, security, and ownership of data in telecom. The paper has highlighted the question if third-party entities could control the data of individuals.\n\nAsked if Apple had shared its suggestions regarding the app, Sharma said: \"Apple has not given us any commitment as yet, we are interested in finding a solution where we are saying that for your own (Apple) customers, you should enable the APIs (application programming interface) so that they are able to send those SMSes or those calls they consider to be pesky,\" Sharma said.\n\nSharma had earlier rubbished reports that Apple's refusal to allow the DND app was because it was not meeting some technology protocols.", "Whatever you might think of our current president, you can't say he doesn't think big.\n\nThe Trump-GOP tax plan just announced has the potential to affect retirement savers in fundamental, long-term ways that could be positive for many Americans. The plan is a long way from reality and is likely to see some changes before becoming law.\n\nFor now, here's the thumbnail version:\n\n* Corporate taxes fall to 20% from the current 35% (and some business deductions end)\n\n* A possible one-time lower rate on repatriated corporate income held abroad, perhaps at 10%\n\n* A 25% rate on \"pass-through businesses,\" whose owners now pay higher, personal income rates\n\n* Three tax brackets -- 12%, 25% and 35% -- rather than the current seven\n\n* A near-doubling of the standard deduction, the first dollar of income taxed, to $12,000 per individual and $24,000 for married couples\n\nThere's more, such as a possible refundable child tax credit and the repeal of the estate tax, but let's focus on what happens to the retirement investor.\n\nIf you work and make enough money to save, chances are you save into a 401(k) plan at work or put money into a personal IRA. So far, so good.\n\nIf you're smart, you then invest that money in stocks DJIA, +0.18% and, perhaps, bonds and other securities. After all, you want your cash to grow faster than inflation, and stocks are the way to get that long-term growth.\n\nNow, about taxes. Some will grumble that the corporate rate is low enough, or that the effective taxes paid by companies is low already.\n\nRead: Trump's tax plan: It's not great, but it could have been worse\n\nBut consider what a corporate tax cut means for retirement savers with investments in the stock market. Sure, lower taxes might mean more jobs. But one thing it means without a doubt is higher corporate income -- money that goes to the owners of U.S. corporations.\n\nLook inside\n\nTake a moment to dig into your 401(k) statement or look at it online. Inside your retirement plan you'll find, most likely, a batch of mutual funds.\n\nDrill down a bit more and you'll quickly realize that mutual funds are nothing more than giant collections of stocks. One widely held stock mutual fund is the Vanguard Total Stock Market VTI, +0.16%\n\nAmong the top holdings of VTI you'll find Apple AAPL, -0.62% Microsoft MSFT, +0.03% Facebook FB, +0.63% Amazon AMZN, +0.58% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.22% Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -0.06% BRK.B, -0.03% Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.93% and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.21%\n\nVanguard fund doesn't pick these stocks because they are \"better\" than any others but because the fund tracks the whole stock market from the largest to very smallest companies -- 3,582 companies in all.\n\nThe top holding, Apple, has a weight of 3% of the total VTI portfolio. What that means is that if you have a $100,000 balance in your retirement plan, you own $3,000 worth of Apple.\n\nYes, you. People lose sight of this, but owning the stock literally means you own Apple. And Microsoft. And Facebook. An increase in the profitability of the companies in your retirement investment portfolio is an increase in value to you, the shareholder.\n\nRead: Advocates fear Trump's tax plan may 'Rothify' 401(k) plans\n\nExtra juice\n\nThe second, crucial point is that retirement savers get to choose their own tax rate. Putting aside money into a 401(k) or IRA directly lowers your taxable income for the year in which you save.\n\nCouple that fact with an increase in the standard deduction and you could see a big decrease in taxes. For instance, if you are married and in the 25% tax bracket, the increase in the standard deduction comes to $2,825 in tax savings.\n\nTreat that money like the raise that is and increase your 401(k) contribution by $109 per paycheck. You won't miss it, really, and over 30 years that little bit of extra juice could compound into $296,568 for your retirement.\n\nTax policy is complicated, but the effects of higher corporate profits is not.

Last summer, Nintendo shocked us all by teaming up with Apple to bring Mario to the App Store in a new game called Super Mario Run.\n\nApple and Nintendo fans alike were excited about the prospect of a mobile Mario game. Then it launched. Not only was it overpriced, but there simply wasn't much content in the game. Slowly but surely, it faded from view, and the experiment seemed to have failed. But this week, Nintendo gave Super Mario Run second life.\n\nOn Thursday, Super Mario Run received its most substantial update since launch on both iOS and Android. The biggest addition to the game is a new mode called Remix 10, in which the player has to complete ten extremely short courses one after the other, collecting coins and stomping enemies along the way. It reminds me of Super Mario Maker's 10 Mario Challenge, which happens to be one of that game's best modes as well.\n\nHaving played through Remix 10 a few times since downloading the update today, I discovered that (for me at least) this was the perfect version of the Super Mario Run experience. It's fast-paced, it's varied and it does not overstay its welcome. Plus, the carrot on the stick is new buildings for your kingdom and the ability to unlock Daisy -- a fan favorite character from the franchise who can double jump in Super Mario Run.\n\nAnd while there's no question that Super Mario Run was lacking in content when it launched, Nintendo has made strides with this update by adding a new world to the World Tour mode. World Star features nine new levels to traverse, but you'll have to complete a series of difficult challenges in order to unlock them.\n\nFinally, Nintendo has also added a new music-play feature so that you can listen to your own music while you play through the game. The characters will even put on headphones in the game to indicate that your music is playing. It's an obvious addition, but done with the typical Nintendo flair we've come to expect.\n\nI never thought I'd tap the Super Mario Run icon on my phone ever again, much less recommend that everyone else give it another chance. But here we are. Best of all, the game is temporarily on sale for half price, so you don't have to spend $10 (like I did) to get the full game on your smartphone or tablet.", "A pioneer in helping consumers cut the proverbial cord from traditional cable television, Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming content such as Netflix over TVs.\n\nNEW YORK: Shares of video streaming firm Roku Inc rose more than 67% in their market debut on Thursday, giving the US IPO market a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nRoku ended trading on the Nasdaq with a share price of US$23.50, giving it a market capitalization of about US$2.23 billion.\n\nThe IPO market is struggling to finish on a high note even though it has already notched more money so far this year than in 2016.\n\nA pioneer in helping consumers cut the proverbial cord from traditional cable television, Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming content such as Netflix over TVs.\n\nBut the market has since become more competitive, with Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and others offering their own devices.\n\nTo compete better, Roku has opened its platform to more TV apps than its peers, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google Play, allowing it to offer over 3,000 channels internationally.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company has also shifted its business model from sales of its Roku box. It licenses its software to companies such as Sharp and Hitachi and gets a cut of the advertising revenue from media companies and new signups for apps on its platform.\n\nRoku Chief Executive Anthony Wood said in an interview that the company will keep riding the wave of television content moving online and away from the cable bundle.\n\n\"When we sign up a customer to a subscription service or Hulu or Netflix, we get a revenue share as well,\" Wood said.\n\nIn six months ended June 30, Roku had around 15.1 million active accounts, with around 6.74 billion hours of content streamed, the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThose numbers, however, have not translated into profitability as the company pumps cash into marketing and R&D.\n\nIn the quarter ended June 30, the company posted a net loss of US$15.5 million, deeper than its US$14.1 million loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\n\"I don't like that they are losing cash, but if you wait for a cash flow positive tech company, you may have to wait for a full solar eclipse to come around again,\" said Brian Hamilton, founder of data firm Sageworks.\n\nRoku's shareholders include Menlo Ventures, Fidelity and Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.\n\nThe 15.67 million Class A share offering was priced at US$14 per share, the upper end of Roku's proposed US$12 to US$14 range, raising about US$219.35 million in proceeds.", "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai urged Apple Inc. on Thursday to activate FM radio chips in its phones in the interests of public safety during natural disasters.\n\nOne problem: Newer iPhones don't even have an FM chip.\n\nIn a statement, Pai laid out the case for activated FM chips, which can give cellular phones the ability to tune in to potentially life-saving information over the radio during a natural disaster, especially when cellular networks are knocked out, as they were when recent hurricanes battered the U.S. and Caribbean.\n\nA week after Hurricane Maria, the FCC said 90% of cell towers in Puerto Rico are still out of service, as are two-thirds of the ones in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nFM radio signals can travel much farther than cellular data signals, making them a potential lifeline in an emergency. Every major smartphone manufacturer that sells in the U.S., including Samsung Electronics Co. 005930, -0.81% , Lenovo Group's 0992, -1.15% Motorola, LG Corp. 003550, +1.16% and HTC Corp. 2498, +2.03% , has FM-activated chips in their most popular phones. Except one.\n\n\"Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so. But I hope the company will reconsider its position,\" Pai said.\n\nIn a statement, Apple AAPL, -0.62% said \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\"\n\nWhile it was unclear exactly why newer iPhones do not have FM chips, some manufacturers use the plugged-in headphone cord as an FM antenna. But starting with the iPhone 7, Apple's phones don't have a headphone jack, and without an antenna, an FM chip is useless.\n\nApple said it \"cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis,\" noting that emergency services can be dialed from a locked screen and that its phones enable government emergency notifications. But those functions would not work when wireless networks are down.\n\nFor years, Pai and the National Associated of Broadcasters have urged phone manufactures to activate FM chips. Pai has said in the past he is against rules requiring activated FM chips, instead hoping companies just do the right thing.\n\n\"It is time for Apple to step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first,\" he said.", "Staff at an Apple retail store in Shanghai told the Global Times on Thursday that sales of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which Apple launched earlier this month, have been good despite media reports that the devices met a chilly reception in the Chinese mainland market.\n\nThe Global Times visited an Apple retail store located on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai at around 11:30 a.m., and saw that the store was filled with customers examining the products or talking to sales staff.\n\nWhen asked by the Global Times whether sales of the new Apple products were going well, a salesperson pointed at the customers and said \"you can see them.\"\n\nA saleswoman also told the Global Times that the iPhone 8 is as popular as the iPhone 7, in her observation. But she also said that the iPhone 8 was not much of an improvement over the iPhone 7, so it's not worth the money to move up.\n\nCompared with the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 has a better-performing camera, a faster chip processor and a firmer glass body, she said.\n\nThe Global Times observed that an iPhone 8 costs 5,888 yuan ($883) (64GB), while an iPhone 8 plus costs 6,688 yuan (64GB), compared with 5, 588 yuan for an iPhone 7 plus (32GB).\n\nA salesman at a Beijing iPhone store told the Global Times earlier that sales of 64GB iPhones were particularly good. \"The stock of 64GB phones at stores are usually sold out every day,\" he said.\n\nThere have been media reports lately that there are not as many domestic customers queuing up for the iPhone 8 as they did for earlier models.\n\nMany people who bought the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus online have returned the devices, causing those phones to fill up the warehouses of certain logistics companies, cs.com.cn reported on Wednesday.\n\nApple Inc on Thursday sent the Global Times a link to a report by US financial network CNBC, which quoted Apple CEO Tim Cook as saying that the company was sold out of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in some stores.\n\nBut Apple didn't address an inquiry by the Global Times as to the sales performance of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in the Chinese market.\n\nLiu Dingding, an independent technology analyst, said that the iPhone 8's improvement over the iPhone 7 is almost \"negligible.\" Apple is also facing strong competition from domestic mobile phone brands like Huawei and Xiaomi, Liu said.\n\nBut Liu applauded the iPhone X, which will be available for sale on November 3, saying that it is a \"groundbreaking innovation\" in terms of its exterior design and its facial recognition function.\n\nAn iPhone X will cost about 8,388 yuan.\n\nApple's shares were trading at $154.2 as of press time, up 0.71 percent.", "The iPhone has what's arguably the best mobile processor in town. The A11 Bionic is as fast as in benchmark tests as some of the most recent Intel chips that power Apple's MacBook Pro, and well above what's possible on Android devices. We've now witnessed various real-life speed tests starring the new iPhone which showed how much faster the handset can be when it comes to day-to-day tasks. But a brand new showdown with the Galaxy Note 8 reveals that Apple may have a problem on its hands.\n\nTo recap, the iPhone 8 Plus crushed the Galaxy Note 8 in 4K video processing tests. But it also lost a similar battle to last year's iPhone 7 Plus, and showed weakness in the most recent comparison with the Galaxy Note 8 in one critical department: RAM management.\n\nYou'll see the same thing happen in the following video. The \"standard\" speed test is performed in PhoneBuff's clip, where both the iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 have to open a series of apps twice. Whatever phone is the fastest overall, wins. The first lap measures how fast each phone opens apps, including basic ones and resource heavy apps. The iPhone is slower when it comes to tiny apps, but wins big when it comes to games and other apps that require more processing power.\n\nThe second lap looks at RAM management, which is where Samsung's 6GB of RAM shines, as all the apps opened on the first lap remain available. Meanwhile, the iPhone 8 Plus keeps some games open but has to reload others. This is what helps the Galaxy Note 8 finish both rounds before the iPhone 8 Plus.\n\nWhat that means for users is that the more apps you have open on an iPhone right now, the less likely for you to pick up where you left off in all of them. For Apple, it means it has to further optimize app management and transitions, and fix RAM management if it needs fixing. If there's one other thing the iPhone is well-known for is being able to quickly bring apps back from memory. The fact that iPhone 7 Plus was faster in a similar test than the iPhone 8 Plus seems to indicate the newest iPhone still needs some work. Also, iOS 11 is anything but polished right now, so there will be plenty of improvements to come.", "A long weekend has arrived for some lucky Australians - kick it off with these tech stories:\n\n1. Paying more for a phone than a computer is where we're at. The new Samsung Galaxy Note8 is a great device, especially for people who want a massive screen and the use of a pen. But the price tag is $1500, and for that you can almost get two premium phones with some other manufacturers. But Apple is unleashing its iPhone X next month, which will be even more expensive - so maybe this is the world we live in now. Read our review of the Samsung Galaxy Note8.\n\n2.

A US grand jury just indicted a former Commonwealth Bank IT manager and a Californian tech entrepreneur. Reuters reports Eric Pulier, founder and former CEO of US tech company ServiceMesh, is accused of paying bribes to Commonwealth Bank IT staff to sign contracts that inflated his company's revenue. This triggered fraudulent \"earn-out bonuses\" to ServiceMesh shareholders, say prosecutors. Former CBA staffer Jon Waldron allegedly pocketed $US1.9 million from the bribes. Arrest warrants are now out for both men.\n\n4. The Perth company making brick-laying robots revealed it's overwhelmed with enquiries.

MR blends the physical and the digital worlds into a single space, using a combination of cutting edge optical hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) software. Over the next 5 to 10 years, most industry analysts agree that the AR/VR market will be worth well north of $100 billion, with the vast majority coming from the AR side -- in the form of consumer innovations in retail, location, or AI services. In terms of the enterprise market, that pie will be smaller, but will lean even more heavily toward AR and MR.\n\nCurrently, at the forefront of the MR revolution is the Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft has uncharacteristically been early to market in this sector, with the HoloLens dominating almost all coverage of actual deployments of the technology. Although Microsoft enjoys an industry-leading position, it does face other threats from both new hardware entrants and established platform holders. Read on to see how the battle lines are being drawn -- and what potential outcomes could emerge over the medium term.\n\nHoloLens moves the game on from the previous-generation MR devices -- such as Google Glass -- which provided little more than the ability to bring up text or simple icons over the user's view. By contrast, the HoloLens is capable of both rendering full 3D objects and data as holograms, and of understanding the world around it in order to place those holograms in physical space. The self-contained nature of the HoloLens (it's a full Windows 10 computer that doesn't require wires or a network connection to function) makes it just as capable on a factory floor, or the middle of a construction site as it is in an office.\n\nThanks to the current generation's $3,000 price, it is more likely it'll be the next generation of MR devices that will revolutionize the consumer market. Meanwhile, industries as diverse as transportation, healthcare, industrial design and education are currently adopting MR via Microsoft's device to disrupt existing business processes.\n\nConsumer VR devices costing several hundred dollars from Oculus, HTC, and Sony run on powerful household desktop PCs that likely cost at least $1,000. They offer immersion in 3D worlds at what can be around $2,000 total, which could previously only be achieved with specialist installations costing $20,000 or more. Meanwhile, AR systems, such as Apple's recent ARKit, allow mobile users to view the world through a window, with digital objects superimposed. Both mediums are potentially disruptive: VR primarily in the consumer space; AR primarily in the enterprise space -- and have acted as gravity wells for venture funding over the 5 years, though both seem to remain perennially a few months from a great inflection point.\n\nIn new MR hardware, the two big players are Magic Leap, the $4 billion Florida-based behemoth; and Meta, the plucky Y-Combinator alumni with a comparatively teeny $73 million war chest. Despite their David-and-Goliath mismatch, Meta seem closer to actual product in the market, though neither have so far shipped devices to allow a true side-by-side comparison with Microsoft's technology. If Magic Leap ever does ship a product, expect an all-out turf war for the enterprise space, as all that venture money may well end up being deployed to compete with an even more capable Hololens 2 that may emerge any time from late 2018.\n\nThe more interesting angle of attack on Microsoft's current position may come from the very capable augmented reality support which both Apple and Google have added to their respective mobile platforms in 2017. The applications of ARKit and ARCore have mostly focused on the traditional 'hold your phone up and look through it' ergonomics, but many companies are looking past this by creating inexpensive head-mounted cradles which can transform a phone into a mixed reality device (think Google Cardboard for MR).\n\nDisney's recent collaboration with Lenovo to create a Star Wars head-mounted AR experience is based around this concept. If this approach proves popular with consumers, it could drastically narrow the considerable lead Microsoft has built up over its rivals Google and Apple, and bring MR to the consumer market -- many years earlier than most analysts have forecast.\n\nUptake of mixed reality has begun, but the sprint toward ubiquity has yet to start. Historically technologies take a while, then hit hard and transform fast. With so many major tech players investing in MR, that future seems assured -- but the likely big winners right now are less clear. Ultimately, as with any new medium, it'll be the players who find the most disruptive, high value use cases for the new capabilities MR enables. With its more consumer-focused siblings riding high in the headlines, challengers to the single dominant platform lining up and enterprise adoption accelerating. Mixed reality is lined up for an interesting next few years.", "Whether you're aware of it or not, your smartphone probably comes equipped with an FM chip. It's an important little piece of technology that remains one of the better ways to communicate over long distances in disaster situations, being that it isn't reliant on cell phone service.\n\nDespite its usefulness, the chip has largely remained dormant in most smartphones sold in the US - until recently, that is. In the wake of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, most major phone manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung and HTC have enabled the functionality for their users.\n\nApple, however, has remained curiously resistant to this trend and that's not sitting well with some.\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday issued an official statement urging the tech giant to \"reconsider its position\" on the activation of this important piece of tech in the iPhone.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the full statement:\n\n\"Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted [activating the FM chip]. But I hope the company will reconsider its position, given the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. That's why I am asking Apple to activate the FM chips that are in its iPhones.\"\n\nPai asserts that it's time for Apple to \"step up to the plate and put the safety of the American people first,\" while applauding the phone manufacturing companies who have already done so.\n\nApple's reasoning behind resisting this request is still unclear but some publications have speculated that the company might be trying to avoid competing with its own music streaming service, Apple Music.\n\nThough Pai has admitted in the past that a case could be made for the blanket activation of FM chips on \"public safety grounds alone,\" he is reluctant to create an official ruling on the subject given his stance on free market policies (as evidenced by his views on net neutrality).\n\nApple responded to Pai's comments in the following statement to MacRumors:\n\n\"Apple cares deeply about the safety of our users, especially during times of crisis and that's why we have engineered modern safety solutions into our products. Users can dial emergency services and access Medical ID card information directly from the Lock Screen, and we enable government emergency notifications, ranging from Weather Advisories to AMBER alerts. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals, so it is not possible to enable FM reception in these products.\"\n\nThis explains why Apple hasn't enabled FM chips in newer iPhones, but not why they haven't done so for older generations of the device.", "The Opposition wants Alberta's privacy commissioner to investigate 800,000 emails deleted by government and political staffers under the NDP.\n\nUnited Conservative Party interim leader Nathan Cooper told the Journal the deleted emails raise serious concerns about government transparency.\n\nHe also wants to know why top political staffers in Premier Rachel Notley's office had only a handful of sent emails and messages in their inboxes, despite their time on the job.\n\nThe UCP came across the information when it asked for numbers of managerial and director government email records in 2016.\n\nIt asked for similar information a few months later, and found 800,000 emails across government departments had been deleted.\n\nWhat it got back also showed Notley's then-chief of staff Brian Topp had just one email in his sent folder, 78 in his inbox, and an empty deleted mail folder.\n\nDeputy chief of staff Anne McGrath had just 18 emails in her inbox, one sent message and, like Topp, an empty deleted items folder.\n\nCooper doesn't think it likely that some of the premier's top staffers sent just a single email in all their time in their positions.\n\nAlso of concern for Cooper were policies from two departments directing staff to get rid of emails in their inboxes.\n\nA deputy minister briefing note in education noted that migration to a new system was the perfect opportunity to \"clean up\" the department's email.\n\nOver in transportation, the department ran a competition for staffers to reduce the number of emails in inboxes by 25 per cent.

The county in 2012 took over Cohoes' and Watervliet's dispatch centers, and the two cities paid $335,000 annually - with Cohoes paying the larger portion (65 percent) - for five years to the county. The cities saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in the consolidation.\n\nSears said Albany and other municipalities are part of a feasibility study of countywide dispatch that will include suggestions on how to implement the consolidation for the city, he added.\n\nCounty Executive Daniel McCoy this month released a shared services plan, but, because of time constraints, it didn't include efforts to consolidate emergency dispatch.\n\n\"We will continue to analyze the potential financial benefits to a shared services agreement on dispatch when a financial analysis is complete,\" McCoy said in a prepared statement.\n\nApple expects by early next year that current improvements being made for the nursing home will be wrapped up so renovation can begin on the Albany Shaker Road facility's fourth and fifth floors to house the emergency dispatch center.\n\nThe county's 911 dispatch currently is in the highway building in Voorheesville, but it doesn't have enough space to absorb all the city's employees.\n\n\"I can't take anybody else until I have more space. Otherwise we'd be jeopardizing the whole system,\" Apple said. \"When this switch gets flipped, we'll have superior technology to anyone around. We'll be able to put 45 seats in there. Something that would absorb the whole county if it ever came there.\"\n\nThe county has about 30 dispatch employees, and would more than double its staff by taking on the city's roughly 35 employees.\n\nThe city is budgeted for 39 total, but Sears said it's a struggle to keep a full complement.\n\n\"It's a very difficult, very stressful job,\" he said. \"So there is some turnover.\"\n\nSears said he expects to be fully staffed in the next few weeks with the hiring of discretionary employees - people who have yet to take the civil service exam.\n\nIt's offered once a year, and Albany has run through the list it had of those who tested as a dispatcher, Sears said. Right now, the department has two who were hired without taking the exam, but will do so next year when it's offered.\n\nApple said the city doesn't need to be at full employment before the county absorbs the city's services. He said no one would be laid off in the consolidation, but as employees retire, positions would be eliminated.\n\nOnce more concrete plans materialize, Sears said, officials will work with the department's union - the Albany Police Officers Union Local 2841.

Who loses? And what should the city do about it?\n\n\"If every episode is like a small stream, then the big river [of the podcast] is, what kind of a city does L.A. want to be moving forward?\" Saul Gonzalez, the host of the podcast and a reporter at KCRW, told LAist. \"Do we want backyards and single family homes and freeways, or do we want this new city that's emerging, which is denser and higher and gives us other options beyond our cars?\"\n\nThere Goes the Neighborhood: Los Angeles is a continuation of WNYC Studios' original There Goes the Neighborhood, which examined gentrification in Brooklyn. The series will be eight episodes long -- the first two episodes are already available on kcrw.com and Apple Podcasts. The remaining six episodes will be released each week over the next six weeks, and explore tensions arising in various parts of the city. There are episodes dedicated to new development in Hollywood, to a white landlord trying to evict his immigrant tenants in Rampart Village and to the experiences of black residents being priced out of Inglewood.\n\nThe series will make an effort to look at the issue from every side, says Gonzalez.\n\n\"We're trying to show all the shades of gray. When that hipster coffee house opens up down the street, it's not a black and white issue,\" says Gonzalez. \"There are people who can be for and against [these changes] at the same time.\"\n\nAn animation showing the changing racial makeup of L.A.

Even as development increases, there is a desperate shortage of housing for middle- and low-income Angelenos: according to the nonprofit California Housing Partnership Corporation, L.A. County needs an extra 550,000 affordable units to house low-income families here. Rents in the city are up, evictions are increasing, and the homelessness crisis is at an apex. Pitched battles over which neighborhoods belong to whom are getting louder and more urgent for people who stand to be displaced, particularly in the Eastside community of Boyle Heights.\n\nThe urgency of the debate has not escaped Gonzalez's attention as he's reported for the series, he says. Arguments about whether more housing should be built, about solutions to the affordability crisis, and about the character of neighborhoods take on a religious importance to residents, especially long-time residents, he says.\n\n\"The intensity of people's connections to their little patch of L.A., just how strongly they feel about it -- that was surprising to me,\" he says.\n\nFind the latest episodes of \"There Goes the Neighborhood\" here.", "Would you pay $1000 or more for a new phone? Apple is counting on it with the iPhone X -- the \"X\" symbolizing the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Fans of the company are falling all over themselves to justify the price, with many forgoing the more affordably priced (and available) new iPhone 8 models. But it's hard to say the X is anything \"new\" when you compare it to what Android phone have been doing for a while.\n\nThe X will be available on November 3. Today, you can get a slightly cheaper and less rah-rah bragging rights Samsung Galaxy Note 8 for a list price around $900. Samsung is throwing in $200 credit to buy extras on the Note given its ah, flaming, reputation and making sure everyone knows the battery on the 8 has been tested, double-tested and won't burst into flames.\n\nHow many features does the X and 8 share? Edge-to-edge OLED screens, no physical \"home\" button, wireless charging, 12MP dual-lens cameras, water and dust proofing, Both the X and 8 (and Galaxy 8) have facial recognition technology, but nearly everyone will freely admit Apple's Face ID technology is a lot better. Face ID might be too good in some respects, if you are worried about having your phone unlocked at a police station without a warrant, but that's a discussion for a different day.\n\nIf you want an iPhone X, you can't even pre-order one until October 27. Media reports suggest orders for the currently available (and cheaper) iPhone 8 and 8 Plus aren't that great because Apple fans want the top of the line X and aren't going to settle for lesser phones. The OLED edge-to-edge display, better cameras, and Face ID are the features being touted as reasons why people are passing on the iPhone 8 family and waiting for the X.\n\nThe single unique feature that carries the X past both the iPhone 8 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is Face ID, the technology used to unlock the X. Analysts believe it will take time for the market to accept FaceID as being reliable, not-hackable, and too easy for a third-party to simply hold up the phone in front of your face to unlock it. Huawei released a video mocking Face ID on September 18 while plugging its forthcoming Mate 10- #TheRealAIPhone- on October 16, proving if nothing else Apple is setting the conversation topics.\n\nFinancial analysts are worried Apple might not be able to keep up with demand for the X while at the same time managing to suppress sales of the available-now iPhone 8/8 Plus series. Fewer units mean less profits and lower earnings, meaning Apple could end up with both unhappy fans and a most unhappy Wall Street if it can't crank out the phones fast enough.", "SOUTHINGTON -- Leonard Marcheselle is being remembered as a family man, political force, community member and friend.\n\nMarcheselle was a member of many community organizations and served on the Town Council and Board of Education. He died last week at 85.\n\n\"He always had his eye opened for someone who would be good for the town,\" said longtime friend Andrew Meade. \"He was a good friend, a loyal man.\"\n\nMarcheselle was born in Hartford and served as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. He worked with many manufacturing companies as a production control manager.\n\nHe moved to Southington in 1958 and over the years was elected to the Town Council, Board of Education and Board of Finance. He also served with the Kiwanis Club, American Legion, Bread for Life and other civic groups. He won the Unico Gold Medal Award for Community Service in 2004, and was named the YMCA's Person of the Year in 2008, and was also recognized by the Southington Chamber of Commerce with its Public Service Award. Marcheselle also served as head of the Republican Town Committee.\n\n\"Everything he did, he did for the benefit of Southington,\" Meade said.\n\nThat includes organizing the annual bed races that draw a crowd during the town's annual Apple Harvest Festival.\n\n\"That draws the second largest crowd,\" Marcheselle told the Record Journal in 2014. \"They lined up on both sides of the street. I would have to say 'please step off the street.' It's really fun to watch.\"\n\nMarcheselle was the announcer during the race, shouting into the microphone to spur on the crowd and contestants.\n\n\"Lenny and I were very good friends,\" said Republican Town Councilor Victoria Triano. \"What an amazing man. His word was truly his bond. He was a staunch supporter of what makes Southington what it is.\"\n\nAs Republican Town Chairman, Marcheselle was very clear, the group had to work together. His civic activity gave him a \"certain place in the community,\" Triano said. \"I lost a good friend.\"", "With the iPhone X finally introducing a new design to the iPhone lineup, it made sense that many would be more attracted to the handset versus the iPhone 8, which apart from its glass back is still very reminiscent of the previous few iPhone generations, not to mention the various new features such as Face ID and an OLED display.\n\nThis is why we can't say we were surprised to learn that the iPhone X could be hurting iPhone 8 sales as some customers could be holding out for it instead. This also seems to be implied by the shorter queues that several Apple Stores are seeing. However according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, his latest report suggests that we could be wrong, and that demand for the new iPhones are stable.\n\nHis report claims that opening weekend sales were about half of that of last year's model, but apparently that is within expectations. His report also goes on to add that the iPhone 8 Plus seems to be a more popular choice this year and is so far accounting for more than half of initial iPhone 8 sales.\n\nAs 9to5Mac points out, there is a chance that the larger queues could still happen when the iPhone X is released which is this November. They also write that the skewed sales could correct itself over time as more customers upgrade, but in the meantime Apple's CEO Tim Cook has claimed that the iPhone 8 is doing well and has actually sold out in some stores.\n\nApple >Cellphones. Read more about iphone 8 and iphone x.", "Analysts appear split on whether Apple will flounder in China with its new iPhone X.\n\nOne school of thought expects consumers in China to be turned off by the iPhone X's hefty price tag of RMB8,388. That's a figure roughly equal to $1,260 (using a currency conversion rate from September 28), making the device significantly more expensive in China than in the US, where the device will be sold at a starting price of $1,000.\n\nThat potential sticker shock comes as cheaper but still high-end smartphones are being churned out by China-based manufacturers like Huawei, which has seen sharply increased levels of adoption lately. According to figures from Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Apple trailed four China smartphone brands in shipment share for Q2 2017: Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.\n\nOthers say it's a mistake to think Apple will fail, given its history of proving detractors wrong time and again. For them, Apple's marketing prowess has created a luxury brand that smartphone users will still adopt in droves, no matter how expensive iPhones get.\n\nIn fact, there are signs that Apple's pricing strategy with the iPhone X is not enough to deter its strongest fans from buying the device.\n\nAccording to a September 2017 survey of internet users in China from Penguin Intelligence, 66.2% of those who planned to buy a new iPhone had their sights set on an iPhone X. That compared with just 20.4% who planned to buy an iPhone 8 Plus, and 13.4% who expected to pick up an iPhone 8. In other words, among those with an intent to buy an iPhone, the cheapest device from Apple's new lineup -- the iPhone 8 -- was the least enticing.\n\nPenguin Intelligence's poll also found that nearly two-thirds of Android users in China named price as a major advantage that devices running Google's operating system (OS) had over the iPhone. By comparison, iPhone users didn't consider price as one of the main benefits of using the Apple devices. Instead, they found value in things like the iOS, as well as the iPhone's overall functionality, security and design.\n\nThe data seems to suggest that those in China set on buying an iPhone won't be dissuaded by Apple's higher pricing strategy, while price factors strongly into considerations made by those who purchase Android devices.\n\nAnd while there have been signs of a tepid response to the release of the iPhone 8 in China, it's still unclear if the iPhone X will garner a similarly lukewarm reception. That device won't arrive in Apple Stores in China until Nov. 3.\n\n-- Rahul Chadha", "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks finished slightly higher Thursday, led by technology companies and drugmakers.

Here's my curmudgeonly advice (which is the same every year),\n\nHere's my curmudgeonly advice (which is the same every year).\n\nDon't Be in a Rush to Upgrade an OS\n\nAs much as you might want to try its shiny new features, you should never rush to install a new version of an operating system on any device you expect to use today.\n\nNever install a new OS before the X.1 release.\n\nSee, installing a new OS is like performing a brain transplant: It replaces pretty much all of the vital software parts that bring your Apple device to life. Without an OS, your Mac, iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, or Apple Watch isn't much more than a pile of components that are dumber than a toaster. Good-looking and pricey toasters, but without an OS they'd be dumber than a rock.\n\nSo, replacing an entire operating system is an operation fraught with opportunities for things to quickly go to heck in a handbasket. While that doesn't happen often, it does happen. And when it does, you can pretty much count on spending at least a few hours trying to get back to where you were.\n\nWill Your Old Hardware and Software Still Work?\n\nAnother thing to consider is the impact an OS upgrade will have on your third-party hardware and software. For example, High Sierra will only support versions 15.35 and later of Microsoft Office. For those still using Office 2011, as many (including my wife) are, you'll either have to downgrade macOS 10.12 Sierra or upgrade to a newer version of Office. The same goes for many older Adobe apps.\n\nSo, before you upgrade to macOS 10.13 High Sierra, might I suggest you make sure that your favorite apps and utilities are going to work? The best place to start is the crowd-sourced application compatibility website www.RoaringApps.com, which already offers High Sierra compatibility information on thousands of Mac apps.\n\nOlder apps may be even more of a problem under iOS 11, which no longer supports 32-bit applications. On my iPhone, for example, that resulted in more than 50 apps that are incompatible and have no updates available. While these are mostly older apps I won't miss much, there are a few -- like Trivial Pursuit, You Don't Know Jack, XLR8, Capo, and WordsWorth, to name a few -- I'm going to miss a lot.\n\niOS App Compatibility Tip\n\nTo find out which of your iOS apps are going to cease to function after you upgrade to iOS 11, launch the Settings app and tap General->About->Applications to see a list of incompatible 32-bit apps (requires iOS 10.3 or later).\n\nAt least 50 apps on my iPhone don't work anymore...\n\nMy Recommendation\n\nI recommend you not install any OS upgrade the first time you see it. Rather, think it through and proceed with caution. Don't forget to make one or more backups, just in case, and do your homework by scouring the Internet for appropriate phrases like, \"macOS High Sierra issues\" or \"iOS 11 problems.\"\n\nOne last thing: Don't forget that it's always harder to downgrade than it was to upgrade in the first place, so think before you click OK."], "2017-09-29": ["OJ Simpson will tuck into steak and get a new iPhone when he is released from prison next week, his lawyer has said.\n\nThe disgraced American football star is \"making arrangements\" for his freedom, which is expected a \"few days\" after Sunday, Malcolm LaVergne told ABC's Good Morning America on Friday.\n\nThat is the earliest eligible date for the 70-year-old to be paroled under a decision reached by a state panel in July.\n\nSimpson, 70, has spent nine years behind bars in Nevada after a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping case.\n\nLaVergne said 'The Juice' wants to see his family and enjoy \"the very simple pleasures\" of life, including eating seafood and steak and getting the new Apple handset.\n\nAnd a close friend told The Sun Simpson will leave Lovelock Correctional Center as a \"humbled\" man.\n\n\"OJ's going to lay back, enjoy life and play some golf\", Bruce Fromong said.\n\nOJ was acquitted of the 1994 killings of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.\n\nHe was later found liable for their deaths in civil court.\n\nLongtime pal Mr Fromong added: \"He's 70 years old now.

The deal will place Apple's iPhones in 900 Reliance and Jio retail stores across India, giving the company a chance to boost its meagre 3 percent market share and close the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics .\n\nFor Reliance, this is the first time the company is offering such a hefty buyback price in a bid to win over high-spending Apple fans whose hunger for data, the company hopes, will boost revenues.\n\nThe offer, which will likely boost Reliance's average revenue per user, will be available to Jio customers who buy the iPhone and subscribe to its 799 rupees ($12.22) monthly package for 12 months.\n\nBy comparison, the industry's monthly average revenue per user was just 80 rupees in the quarter ended-June, according to recent regulatory data.\n\nWhile there is no penalty for downgrading to a cheaper plan or leaving the contract mid-way through, customers who do so will lose out on the buyback offer.\n\nThis is unlike contract deals in some Western countries where the total cost of a phone is subsidised and there is a penalty for dropping contracts mid-way.\n\nWith the Apple deal at the high end of the spectrum, Jio is also working to woo cost-conscious aspirational smartphone buyers at the lower end with a $23 4G phone that blurs the line between a smartphone and a traditional feature phone.\n\nThe company, which has signed on 128 million users in less than a year via cut-price deals, is now eyeing between 250-300 million customers in the next two years, a source has told Reuters.\n\n(Writing by Aditi Shah; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Adrian Croft)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "If you're an iOS developer looking to raise awareness of your game, advertising on sites like TouchArcade is a great way to reach a hyper-targeted audience of iOS gamers and industry influencers who view the site multiple times a day. We offer options ranging from sponsoring our podcast, advertising on our forums, or even completely re-skinning the site. Apple's editorial featuring games team constantly visits TouchArcade, along with (obviously) our whole staff, so having well-placed ads on a site like TouchArcade can be exponentially more effective at getting word out about your game than paying a PR person (likely way more money) to send us emails. For more information, contact our ad sales manager at ads@toucharcade.com.\n\nSupporting Us on Patreon\n\nPatreon is our primary funding source these days. If you're unfamiliar, you're able to more or less \"subscribe\" to creators (like us) whose content you value. We offer several different tiers of support, which grant things like cosmetic rewards on our forums, as well as access to a Patreon-only chat channel on our Discord server. All Patreon backers also get a video version of our podcast. Developers who support us on Patreon on the \"Indie Developer\" tier and above get access to a developer chat on on Discord for direct access to TouchArcade staff (and other developers), along with other developer-exclusive content like a business insights email newsletter, event reports, and more. We're also in the process of working with a few different highly relevant companies for exclusive discounts for Patreon backers, although nothing has been finalized just yet.\n\nOverall, a good way to look at our Patreon is to think of TouchArcade as a magazine you'd subscribe to. If you used to pick up a copy of GamePro every month for five bucks (back when magazines only cost five bucks), kick us $5 instead. We provide way more content than print magazines ever could, in an infinitely more timely manner. If you'd like to support the site for more than that because we've saved you money over the years by helping you avoid bad games or by highlighting games you wanted when they were on sale... Even better! The way we look at it is that there's nothing more valuable than time, and we work well over a full time schedule to try and save YOU time by not having to sort through the crap on the App Store. If we've provided value to you in any of these ways, please consider giving back to us with your support.\n\nAmazon Prime Members Can Subscribe to Us on Twitch for Free\n\nIf you're an Amazon Prime member, you get way more benefits than fast shipping that you might not even be aware of. One of those perks is Twitch Prime. Once you link up your Amazon account with Twitch, aside from a bunch of random gaming-related freebies, you'll also be able to subscribe to one Twitch channel per month for free. We hope you use that free subscription on our Twitch channel. Something to keep in mind with these free Twitch subscriptions is they do not auto-renew. You'll need to manually re-subscribe every month, so if you'd like to go one tiny step further for us, set a recurring reminder on your iPhone's calendar to remember to do this.\n\nSubscribe on Twitch and/or Cheer with Bits\n\nIf you're not an Amazon Prime member, you can still subscribe to our Twitch channel, it just costs $4.99. Something to keep in mind with this is the Twitch revenue share is 50/50, so if you just want to support the site and don't really specifically care about Twitch, your dollars go way farther over on Patreon as they take significantly smaller payment processing fees. But, hey, if you just love Twitch and want the perks that come with a subscriber, rock on.\n\nAnother thing you can do on Twitch to help us out is cheer us with Bits. It's a new thing Twitch recently added that let you more or less \"tip\" the active streamer with a Twitch-exclusive currency that gets added to our account which Twitch eventually pays out on. Much like subscriptions, the revenue share on Twitch Bits isn't great, but you can get them for free if you're willing to view some ads on Twitch. Cheering is pretty fun while streaming as there's a whole lot of fanfare when Bits come in, they get added to a tip cup, and Twitch chat gets all excited.\n\nShop on Amazon Through Our Affiliate Link\n\nIf you do a lot of shopping on Amazon, visiting the easy to remember URL toucharcade.com/amazon and clicking through our link gives us credit as the referral for everything you buy. Amazon then gives us a very tiny percentage of the sale, which they'd otherwise just keep for themselves. They have widely varying commission rates, but everything (short of just buying cash gift cards) awards us something.\n\nAmazon Pantry items are among the highest commissions Amazon pays, so if buy a lot of non-perishables and other home goods on Amazon, clicking our link first would be amazing- It also helps keep the joke alive that TouchArcade is in part supported by toilet paper sales since mobile gamers spend a lot of time playing on the toilet.\n\nOne-Time Contributions via PayPal\n\nOne thing a lot of people have asked us for is the ability to do one-time payments via PayPal. As part of setting up everything to make our Twitch channel work, we also have a more user-friendly way to do one-time payments. Click here, fill out the form, and it'll toss you over to PayPal to complete your payment. All of your PayPal information remains confidential, so we'll really only know what you fill out on the one-time contribution page. If you want to cover PayPal fees, there's a checkbox for that too. One thing to keep in mind with this is that since this whole thing is built with Twitch in mind, it's outside of all the automated stuff we've built for Patreon. If you don't care about those rewards, rock on. Additionally, if we're streaming when you donate, it'll automatically read your note on stream.\n\nTell Your Friends and/or Share Our Stories on Social Media\n\nIf you love TouchArcade, but really just aren't interested in supporting the site financially, you can still do us a solid via word of mouth. If a friend of yours just got a new iPhone, recommend they check out TouchArcade to find some great games to download. Additionally, we go out of our way to produce great long-form content which typically doesn't generate that much search traffic. For instance, Shaun's amazing RPG Reload series, which I think is some of the best content we publish, are among the worst performing articles on the site. If you read something here that you find insightful, or otherwise interesting, please take a moment to encourage your friends to check it out on Twitter or Facebook. You might think one share doesn't mean much, but we can clearly tell the difference in site analytics.", "SINGAPORE: During tough economic times, Victor Tay was often the voice of Singapore's businesses as the former Chief Operating Officer of the Singapore Business Federation, from 2010-2015. Today, Tay applies his business expertise to the social services sector. As President of the Association of Persons with Special Needs (APSN), he has spearheaded their social enterprise initiatives in order to bring in funds to finance the organisation's many needs.\n\nHe is also Chief Development Officer at the Nanyang Technological University, a job which he says has deepened his thoughts about how education can be shaped to boost not just business excellence, but societal mindsets about true inclusiveness.\n\nHe went \"On the Record\" with Bharati Jagdish about what it will take to transform Singapore into a more accepting society. They first talked about the current business climate, where despite many Government initiatives aimed at helping businesses over the last few years, he says there are still issues with foreign manpower and business grant policies.\n\nVictor Tay: This lies in the philosophy or the doctrine of what the Government tends to do. The foreign worker levies are actually re-channelled to their grants programmes for companies, but in terms of choosing or qualifying companies for these grants, because it involves taxpayers' money, the government puts in stringent guidelines.\n\nTypically, the companies the Government chooses for grants tend to be the stronger companies. These are companies that can actually project better returns or generate more employment. What about the weaker ones? Those who actually not able to do these things, meaning they are struggling, don't get the grants.\n\nThis is quite a paradigm shift from many other countries. I just hosted a Chinese delegation this morning from the Chinese Ministry of Finance and their thinking is that the grants are to help the weak and the vulnerable companies so that they survive and the general environment is good. In Singapore, we tend to pick winners. We forget that some businesses or even people who are not obvious winners might have strengths that could take us to even greater heights if we support them.\n\nBharati: Where do you stand on this issue?\n\nTay: I think we need to strike a balance. While we pick winners, there will be some companies that are currently vulnerable but could actually have great potential. I think they need great attention too.\n\nBharati: But like you said earlier, this is taxpayers' money and the Government has to be accountable, so wouldn't you say it's fair for them to pick those with the most potential?\n\nTay: I think with limited resources, it's inevitable and ingrained in the guidelines and criteria that they will try to choose the stronger ones. From the Government's point of view, yes, taxpayers' money is important. Businesses on the other hand, highlight that the vulnerable, and weak ones should be given attention. It's just like social needs. We look at vulnerable groups and give them assistance.\n\nBharati: But these are businesses. Should they expect charity?\n\nTay: Yes, I think that's valid. I think many businesses also highlight that Taiwan, America and various other places do not have many grants or assistance programmes for businesses. Companies are entrepreneurial. They can grow by themselves. I think our companies here do have backbones. But some of them raise the question of foreign worker levies.\n\nThey say as long as you don't pinch levies from me, I won't need to seek grants back from you. Allow me that cashflow and I will grow in an entrepreneurial way, just like in any other economy without a reliance on the government.\n\nIf the money can be re-channelled into entrepreneurial effort, businesses can look into internationalising themselves, doing other more fruitful things. That's food for thought for our policymakers.\n\nBharati: Do you, like these entrepreneurs you speak of, think that's a better way to go?\n\nTay: Yes. Our current way of taking levies from all types of companies, putting them in a central pool, then distributing them in the form of grants to the stronger ones is disadvantageous to many companies.\n\nBharati: If there are no levies though, won't the foreign worker numbers go out of hand again?\n\nTay: In manpower policy, there are two levers. One is the levies, the other is the quota. The quota can remain and will restrict the number of foreign workers coming in. I think many of the businesses find the quota will do. The levy is not necessary. But I suppose the government uses levies to shape behaviour. Channeling the money back to the programmes or grants and making businesses apply for them could compel businesses to evolve faster than if they were left to their own devices.\n\nBharati: You talked about striking a balance in the status quo - if the levies continue and grant schemes are offered, don't just pick winners when it comes to grant distribution. In that context, give me an idea of how you would like to see grants distributed. They surely can't be given to every weak company.\n\nTay: There's an issue with how to ensure an equitable distribution in the application process. It takes a lot of effort from the businesses and from the administrators. The current system requires enterprises to actually project forward, their projected returns in three to five years. That in itself could exclude a lot of companies with potential. For instance, a startup medical device or biomedical company whose trials could take many years, or maybe a social enterprise, may not give you that return so quickly. But they could give you those returns later.\n\nThey may be a niche company, one that's a differentiator. For instance, Airbnb or Uber. Five years ago, people might have looked at those business models and said they were not workable. Administrators might actually disqualify them if they had applied for grants.\n\nSo under the schemes which are sometimes too defined, new entrepreneurial, innovative companies might be negated. We probably have to develop a new paradigm to spot these types of companies, the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world before they become prevalent. We still operate on very traditional success indicators. We still largely go by the matrix methods used in schools - how many As you've scored, and in business, how much you can project in terms of returns. Sometimes you have to have faith and take a risk.\n\nBEYOND \"SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\"\n\nBharati: You talked about vulnerable companies that might have been overlooked under the current system and have had to close as a result. Some might say it's fair. It's about the survival of the fittest.\n\nTay: I have a theory about this. If we think of this in terms of humankind in all parts of the world, there are certain areas which are less conducive in terms of hygiene factors and therefore, they have a high infant mortality rate, or their average lifespan is only 50-plus or 40-plus. We could just say: okay, that's the survival of the fittest. But we could also think about it differently. There are developed economies where most people have long life expectancies because most hygiene factors are taken care of. Their young men and young women are able to live a more fruitful lifestyle because the conditions in those countries allow them to. I think for businesses, likewise, we have seen lower mortality rates in other countries too.\n\nWe must not think about it in terms of some companies thriving at the expense of others. Think about it terms of increasing the number of thriving companies.\n\nBharati: But there is also a sense though that many companies are not doing their part. They don't adapt fast enough or innovate fast enough. It's a mindset issue. What do you think?\n\nTay: I found among the businesses that died post-2010, many had long history. Some were family-run businesses. They had weathered many crises before that. There was the oil crisis in the 1980s, there was the SARS crisis and the Asian financial crisis. Many of these businesses survived through all that. The banks collapsed but they still survived. They highlighted that they actually were resilient. They highlighted to me that they were entrepreneurial, but they collapsed under the more stringent manpower restriction regime post-2010. I think this seemed to shed some light on the possibility that policy does have an effect actually. To look at entrepreneurs and say they are totally not changing their mindset, not being innovative - I think that's not necessarily fair to them. Business is about survival, business is about competitiveness, business is about how to differentiate themselves and this had always been in their minds, but the lack of resources did them in.\n\nBharati: But we must acknowledge that many businesses did survive even under the harsher conditions. So while these businesses that you speak of managed to survive previous crises, what did they lack relative to the businesses that managed to survive post-2010?\n\nTay: Of course, in every cohort there are some black sheep and those that do not quite do themselves justice, but I must say the doubling of company deaths, in many cases, was not because of a mindset issue. Just like when it comes to certain countries where young babies or young children have a high mortality rate, we might say some of them are not helping themselves, but there are general environmental issues as well.\n\nSingapore is likely the easiest place to start a business, but not necessarily the easiest place to maintain the business.\n\nIt's a very high-cost environment. Secondly, it is totally open to the entire world, so any American, European, Chinese company can come in and our SMEs will have to compete and have to be born global right from the beginning. So maybe look at some of the issues we discussed earlier. Think about levies, or the distribution of grants. Think about encouraging companies to then put their resources into internationalisation from the start.\n\nIn Singapore, because we have a small domestic market, everyone competes against each other. But they don't see that they gain leverage by synergising everyone's efforts. Two to three companies partnering each other can provide a more comprehensive spectrum of services. They can have better skills and mass to compete, hence when they go overseas, if they collaborate, they compete in an entire value chain. So for instance, a company that is in trucking can work with another doing warehousing and packing, etc. If they come together, they can expand their services. I think this is something that many Singapore companies are not doing well.\n\nSingapore companies do not collaborate well right from the beginning. They're suspicious and also count their pennies too early.\n\nSometimes you need to invest for the longer-term horizon and if you look at everything from a return on investment perspective within a three-year time frame, it makes many of these investments unattractive and unlikely. But we have seen enterprises in other countries investing for the long haul - five to 10 years and they make it back after. We need to be open to that.\n\nBharati: You talked about how the restrictions on foreign manpower have caused problems for businesses. The problems are related to, among many factors, Singaporeans' unwillingness to work in certain sectors. But also to the fact that foreign manpower had depressed wages in certain sectors before levies kicked in and of course the overall slowdown in population growth. Should companies be doing more to attract local manpower and to make sure they share productivity gains with their workers more equitably? It often seems as if they only care about their bottomlines and don't consider the importance of these other things, including the welfare of their workers.\n\nTay: I think that position has shifted. Today, businesspeople are becoming more enlightened. I think they realise to be sustainable, they have to actually share part of their profits with their workers. We hear about the multinationals, companies like Google, that give strong incentives. They give free meals. They have nice campuses. They try to incentivise individuals and therefore these people stay. But there are also businesses in tough times that are actually bleeding and hence they would treat their workers differently. They are not able to incentivise.\n\nThere is a perception that even when these businesspeople have profits, they will buy themselves another Mercedes rather than share profits with their employees. That can't happen anymore.\n\nManpower is thin. Therefore there is competition for manpower. Staff who are not well treated tend to leave. We have seen this in the last seven years. Many of them will job-hop. Businesses that are just hoarding profit or larger-than-life entrepreneurs who are self-centred are not able to retain talent and don't exist for long.\n\nBharati: Earlier, you talked about how Government support and entrepreneurial effort should be geared towards growing global brands. What other factors do you think are needed to help Singapore produce global companies like Alibaba or Facebook? Some of these global companies did this even without government assistance.\n\nTay: I think we have to change our culture, our definition of success. It's got to start from schools. Our paradigm is about picking winners. But our definition of winners is quite a traditional one. If we look at Bill Gates in his early years, he was hardly a success by our standards. When he was in a school, he was flirting around with different courses, he was studying design icons, he was trying to do animation. He didn't wear his shoes.\n\nIf Bill Gates had turned up at a Singaporean company looking for a job when he was younger, most of the employers would likely have said \"out you go\". If he had wanted to work in the civil service here, it would have been worse. He didn't even have straight As.\n\nSometimes our traditional way of measuring success does not qualify for what is the current or future business model of success. I think we must find new ways to define these successes and this goes back to our education system, be it primary school or secondary school to see how we can ingrain it in our students to see that it's no longer about scoring full marks or that distinction.\n\nInstead, it's about the breadth of thinking. It's about coming up with something new. It's about how you differentiate yourself. Unless we change, the whole society from employers, civil servants to hiring managers and entrepreneurs will use a very traditional yardstick and discount all the likes of Uber, Apple and even Bill Gates.\n\nAt the Nanyang Technological University, throughout the years, we have been rejuvenating our paradigm of training students. In the past, in classrooms, it used to be a unilateral way of teaching and learning. The lecturer would teach all the students. Now, we realise that's no longer efficient. We do the flipped classroom method of teaching and learning. The tables around the classroom have projector screens all throughout so students actually discuss, point at their screens and are therefore be able to cross-learn and cross-present to each other.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is also rethinking how we can do this earlier in education. Students nowadays are doing project modules so that they can actually research a particular topic and they also try to drill more breadth into it now. Students go for external camping and adventures so that they also train their leadership skills, etc.\n\nBharati: Ultimately though, many say the academic and standardised tests take centrestage when it comes to how success is measured.\n\nTay: Yes, and we tend to do very well at those. For example, the USA does not do as well as Singapore in terms of primary school Math and in Math and Science Olympiads. But they have more people like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates who dropped out of school and yet are able to come up with enterprises that are able to conquer the world. Our students somehow after graduating tend to choose investment banking, go into government, or be employed as professionals in multi-national corporations.\n\nSo I think even if the schools don't do it, we need to recognise diversified paths and routes of success at every turn. Don't discount people just because they didn't do well in school.\n\nBut schools also should change to keep up. I think we should now look at ingraining independent thinking and analytical skills in students. I've seen some cases of test papers where alternative answers were given to the model answer and they were marked wrong even though some of the alternative answers could have been correct. Perhaps we give bonus points to students who give a different answer instead of marking them wrong immediately.\n\nIn the global scene, to be able to compete, to differentiate yourself and to contribute to society - all these things are important. However, we seem to be generating stereotypical students who might be good in school but become under-appreciated when they go into the world.\n\nEducation should look at helping people draw out their individual talents. In the Western world, they put importance on individuality and they seem to have done it quite well.\n\nCOMPETING WITH HEARTWARE IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES SECTOR\n\nBharati: Recently, you crossed over to the social services sector. You are President of the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN). You've exercised your business acumen in this effort too through social enterprises that have been helping raise funds for the association and also providing employment for people with special needs. But I understand that getting professionals to enter the sector is still a challenge and you've been struggling with this for some time. Is your model of building social enterprises to finance your operations and paying people better for working in this sector actually working?\n\nTay: Yes, the Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) sector is not one of those that is able to retain talent or even attract talent. We've done some branding efforts to get professionals to come in, but it's also about finances. Obviously, if VWOs do not get their act right, they will tend to be financially strapped, and if they are financially strapped, they can't pay well and they cannot attract talent nor retain talent.\n\nAt APSN we were, in the past, just looking to the students to pay us a fee, but it was not enough because in terms of our specialist needs, we had psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, job coaches and we needed a lot deeper skill sets than normal mainstream schools, and these efforts require funds to sustain.\n\nThere are Government grants for this, but we need to also do other things to add revenue and also increase our ability to demonstrate the skillsets of our students. So we set up the Mystical Cafe. In the last seven months, we've actually had quite a lot of patrons come by and it helps shift the paradigm when it comes to inclusiveness and also helps us fund our needs and provide gainful employment to people with special needs.\n\nBharati: You once said that it's very challenging to get teachers to work in special schools. Is that still a challenge?\n\nTay: Yes, and we still have problems competing for talent based on pay. So we try to compete with the heartware. We try to portray the VWO as one that really would have an immense societal impact. We have to draw them on compassionate grounds, show them how they can transform lives. It's no longer just about the pay, it's no longer about scaling the hierarchy, so they have a different sense of gratification.\n\nBharati: What do you think will help accelerate the impact of such efforts?\n\nTay: There needs to be a spirit of inclusiveness all round. Then we might have a better time attracting talent to this sector too. I think we are in the commencement stage. We are now slightly more aware because the Government is putting more of a focus on it, but I think we are still trying to manage the differences.\n\nTay: When I look at Europe, Japan or America, they have some successful models of inclusive education. From the start, children in kindergarten or their equivalent of primary one are exposed to diverse individuals with disabilities. In Singapore, we do this when it comes to race.\n\nIt's paramount for us to have multi-racial schools and classrooms. But in terms of people with special needs, we don't integrate them as much. We put them in different schools so many of us don't get exposed to them, and when we encounter them elsewhere, we don't know how to behave.\n\nWe need to have a different type of societal learning. I think if we integrated them from the time they are in school, we will do better, when it comes to working life. Employers in Singapore are cautious when it comes to hiring people with special needs. For example, when a special needs person gets excited, the employer associates it with violence. It's an awareness process.\n\nBharati: Recently a primary school here started integrating hearing impaired students into mainstream classrooms. How can successful integration happen considering that generally, there are concerns among parents and students? Some are concerned that the teaching and learning process might have to slow down, or that there might be more disruptions within the classroom if there were a number of special needs children.\n\nTay: Yeah, these are valid concerns. In the special needs sector we have a smaller teacher-student ratio, 1:5 or 1:8. The other issue is that a recent Lien Foundation survey asking parents if they are fine if their children get exposed to special needs children in a more inclusive society, they overwhelmingly said \"yes\", but when asked if they are fine with their children being placed in the same class as them or sitting next to a child with special needs, they said \"no\". I think that reflects the general sentiment. Many think that it's good but they fear that the presence of special needs kids will impact their own children's studies and progress.\n\nThat brings me back to what we talked about earlier. What are our success indicators? Success shouldn't be about the number of As you score.\n\nIf we measure a person's success based on their versatility, ability to communicate and interact with multiple personalities including special needs individuals, then parents will want their kids to be exposed and actually want their kids to sit next to a special needs child in class.\n\nIt goes back to our societal benchmark of success and how Singaporeans want to measure their child's successes.\n\nBharati: When it comes to the practical aspects though, for example, what you said about teacher-student ratios, ensuring that learning still occurs as smoothly as possible, what solutions can you suggest?\n\nTay: I'm quite heartened by another example that the United Nations has shared. They highlighted that in the past, there were two groups of people that that they were focusing on. One was the ageing population, especially those who do not get enough care from their children. The other segment was children - especially new-born babies - whose working parents do not look after them well enough. They experimented by putting these two groups together in a community and they found that it was actually beautiful. The older folks were looking after the babies and their lives were being enriched by it. The children's lives were enriched too as they were then learning from someone other than domestic helpers. The two groups complemented each other.\n\nIf we bring this back to the issue of special needs children and an inclusive society, I think just like in any other society, there will always be stronger, weaker or more vulnerable people. They can co-exist and most of them can actually learn from each other too. The stronger students need to learn how to help the weaker ones. The teachers don't have to be the only ones doing the work. People with special needs have gifts and talents too that can help the other normal kids.\n\nThis can be applied to those with severe disabilities as well. Some of them who are slightly more severely challenged than the rest have a talent somewhere. We just have to spot it and I think that lies in our education system to see how to support that strength in individuals and negate their weaknesses.\n\nPeople can cross-learn from each other, and therefore there is no absolute weaknesses or absolute strength. Teacher education here has to change.\n\nTeachers need to learn how to spot talent, help children develop their own ability to help others.\n\nWe are a rapidly ageing population and more and more children are reporting conditions like autism.\n\nThere is a need to grow the competence of the teaching workforce and the ability to support them. We see many sad cases where in the hawker centres, some impatient customers lash out at special needs individuals, not knowing that they have special needs. Society is made up of diverse individuals. Many of our students who work at fast-food restaurants have to deal with such things as well. Patrons are quite impatient. I think exposure has to increase, so that tolerance can grow and so that there can be acceptance. People generally have to slow down and understand that we are a diverse society and we need to have a paradigm and mindset shift in that direction.\n\nThere should be a greater emphasis on civic education early. When it comes to work, some countries give incentives to employers for hiring those with special needs and I believe we have such provisions too.\n\nBharati: But isn't it sad that companies need to be incentivised to be more compassionate?\n\nTay: Just enough so that they can make the workplace disabled-friendly. You need wheelchair-friendly spaces, ramps. These efforts should be encouraged and showcased a lot more. SG Enable celebrates superiors, managers who are compassionate and empathetic. Some actually even inspire the rest of their workforce so that they are able to triumph over their limitations. We should celebrate these things even more.\n\nWe need new societal learning. One of my friends once said that she was on the MRT one night. The carriage was otherwise empty. A teenage boy got on the train at the next station and came and sat right next to her even though there were so many empty seats all over the place.\n\nHe was a special needs individual and had a child's mind. His mentality was: there's someone there, let me say \"hi'. Some of these individuals have very pristine thoughts. They think like children. If I see you there sitting alone, I will go over and say \"hi\" and play with you.\n\nBut for the rest us, we may have had a different type of learning that has made us sceptical or cynical about human intentions. Perhaps some of us need to unlearn some of these instincts when dealing with people who have special needs because their intention is pure and pristine. They are quite innocent and they look at things from a very pure angle.\n\nI have anecdotes from employers who work with our students. For example, Uniqlo highlighted to us a special needs individual in their sales workforce. They said this special needs individual is one of the most jovial, most enlightened workers and even customers who come in feeling down are cheered up by this individual. So there is a strength there and the employer is capitalising on it. Why not leverage the strength rather than keep focusing on the inadequacies.", "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak penned an op-ed on Friday with a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, urging the current FCC to stop its proposed rollback of Obama-era net neutrality regulations.\n\nIn the op-ed published by USA Today, Wozniak and Michael Copps, who led the FCC from 2001 to 2011, argued the rollback will threaten freedom for internet users and may corrode democracy.\n\n\"The path forward is clear. The FCC must abandon its ill-conceived plan to end net neutrality,\" wrote Wozniak and Copps. \"Instead of creating fast lanes for the few, it should be moving all of us to the fast lane by encouraging competition in local broadband connectivity and pushing companies to deliver higher speeds at more affordable prices. It's the right thing for us as consumers and as citizens.\"\n\nNet neutrality is a longstanding digital principle that internet service providers should treat all web traffic equally and fairly. This means providers cannot prefer one website or service over the other by granting unequal loading speeds or by blocking or slowing content.\n\nIn 2015, the FCC passed a resolution to reclassify providers like public utilities and subjected them to tougher regulations. The now-Republican-led FCC wants to erase the reclassification with the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" proposal.\n\nThe proposal drew a record 22 million public comments and media attention over the past few months. In July, tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon spoke out against the proposal in a \"Day of Action\" protest. Internet providers AT&T and Comcast raised eyebrows when they declared support for net neutrality and the day of action, although the rollback of the rules would benefit them.\n\nWozniak and Copp urged FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to heed the public cries against the proposal.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a nugget of truth to the adage that Washington policymakers are disconnected from the people they purport to represent,\" they wrote. \"It is a stirring example of democracy in action. With the Internet's future as a platform for innovation and democratic discourse on the line, a coalition of grassroots and diverse groups joined with technology firms to insist that the FCC maintain its 2015 open internet (or 'net neutrality') rules.\"\n\nOpponents of net neutrality took a blow on Thursday, when the Senate voted 59-41 to advance Pai's re-nomination as FCC Chairman. Once the Senate votes again next week to confirm Pai's re-nomination, Pai will remain at his position for another five years.\n\nOne net neutrality advocacy group started a petition to urge the Senate to fire Pai. The group, Free Press, says it collected more than 10,000 votes in the first 24 hours.\n\n\"Since he joined the Commission, he's worked to undo policies designed to protect internet users, communities of color and poor people,\" reads the petition. \"He's failing at his job.\"", "Dr. Yoram Solomon is a creativity and innovation speaker and the author of Un-Kill Creativity: How Corporate America Can Out-Innovate Startups.

He is a former professor of technology and industry forecasting at the University of Texas at Dallas, and a National Speakers Association member. He holds nine patents and many innovation awards, and was named \"TI's great innovator.\" In 2015, he was elected to the Plano Independent School District board.\n\nMany technologies follow the Gartner Hype Cycle. The expectations from the new technology increase until they reach their highest at the \"Peak of Inflated Expectations,\" when users believe it can do just about anything. Then they drop to the \"Trough of Disillusionment,\" when customers realize the technology is not living up to the inflated expectations. Many technologies are abandoned at that stage. Finally, through the moderately upward \"Slope of Enlightenment\" they finally reach the \"Plateau of Productivity,\" or the place where the expectations are not only realistic, but are actually met.\n\nAnd so is the case with the QR Code technology. Invented originally in 1994, it became standardized in 2000 (and later in 2006, and recently in 2015). Initially, articles came out showing you everything you could do with QR codes, followed by articles predicting the death of them. But most recently, Apple brought them back with the introduction of a QR code reader native to the iPhone (and iPad) camera app. If there is a QR code within the camera's field of view--it will automatically ask if you want to connect to it.\n\nNo longer do you have to get a specialized app to read QR codes. Just use one of the most used applications in your phone; your camera app.\n\nHere are 3 tips on what you can do to leverage this added feature.\n\nThere are plenty of QR code generators available online. This is only one of them. They typically offer basic functionality for free, and advanced functionality (such as customizing your logo into the QR code) for a fee. Create a responsive landing page that can be read on mobile phones, and generate the QR code for the link to it.\n\nWhile QR codes are typically used to represent a website link address, they can be used for many other things. You can create a QR code that will send an email or an SMS text message. You can create a link to a PDF file, or even an MP3 music file. Finally, you can create a QR code that has your virtual business card in it.\n\nQR codes vary in complexity. The longer the link you want to represent with a QR code is, the more pixels the QR code requires. Free online services such as goo.gl, tinyurl.com, bitly.com, ow.ly, and more are available to take what would otherwise be a long URL and make it shorter. The two QR codes in the image below represent the same URL (try them...). The one on the left contains the full, 67-character URL, while the one on the right was shortened by goo.gl into 13 characters. The one on the left has 33x33 pixels, while the one on the right has only 21x21 pixels. Why should you care? Because the one on the right can be read by your camera from a distance that is almost 60% longer... Make your URLs shorter before you create your QR code.", "Lottery winners on tiny Irish island claim prize, but no one's saying who they are\n\nA Toronto-area company's upcoming video game called Dirty Chinese Restaurant is being denounced as racist, but its creators are defending their work as satire.\n\nThe game was produced by the Markham, Ont.,-based Big-O-Tree Games. The studio's website reads, \"Because being politically correct is so ... boring.\"\n\nGamers play as a chef named Wong Fu in a run-down Chinese restaurant. In the process of serving customers and running the restaurant, players will have to chase cats and dogs with a cleaver, scavenge for ingredients and dodge immigration officials.\n\n\"The game maker titled their game Dirty Chinese Restaurant. Let's call it the way it is. The title of the game already is racist. It's stereotyping, and it's very prejudiced,\" Ontario member of the Provincial Parliament Soo Wong told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\nWong is the first female Chinese-Canadian to be elected to the Ontario Legislature. She represents the riding of Scarborough-Agincourt, close to Big-O-Tree's home of Markham.\n\n\"My big concern here is that this will further inflame the discussion about racism, prejudice against the Asian community,\" she said. \"We cannot allow this kind of so-called game to be seen as comedy or satire. This is anything but comedy, but satire.\"\n\nWong, a former school board trustee, is particularly concerned that children in Asian-Canadian communities will play the game and have it build impressions of their own cultures.\n\n\"We cannot allow young people growing up seeing their culture, their own identity being played out in such a racist manner,\" she said. \"It's very derogatory, very stereotyping, and very prejudiced.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the game attracted wider attention when New York congresswoman Grace Meng denounced the game on social media.\n\n\"This game uses every negative and demeaning stereotype that I have ever come across as a Chinese-American. How we portray people matters,\" she tweeted.\n\nIn Canada, politicians from both sides of the aisle are also taking a stand.\n\n\"This attack on Chinese-Canadians is unacceptable and hurtful. I fully condemn this attack on our hardworking Ontario business owners. Respecting the right to free speech includes the right to condemn hateful attacks on our neighbours and friends,\" said Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown.\n\nSeveral other Canadian politicians, including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and federal Heritage Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly, denounced the game on social media.\n\nThis game is offensive to Chinese Canadians and has no place in our society.

Only a small number of people had purchased these new iPhones because most have been waiting for the iPhone X. Many buyers took it to MacRumors forum, Reddit and Apple's support forum to complain about the iPhone 8 crackling sound issue.\n\niPhone 8 crackling sound is a software problem\n\nFortunately, Apple has promised to fix the issue via a software update. The tech giant is already working on a fix. \"Dozens\" of users complained that there was a crackling or \"static\" sound coming out of their brand new phone's earpiece. It was disrupting the audio during the phone calls. The issue was first reported by The Verge, one of whose editors experienced it first-hand. It sounds like \"sharp pops at the very edge of the earpiece,\" said The Verge.\n\nThe iPhone 8 crackling sound appears to be a software problem rather than a hardware one. It affects both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Users in different forums reported that it was happening across a variety of carriers in different parts of the world. It occurs during the phone and FaceTime calls, though it doesn't happen with every single call. The iPhone 8 crackling noise doesn't appear when using the earpiece as the loudspeaker. If it were related to hardware, there would be a consistency in the problem.\n\nApple says the issue affects only 'a small number' of users\n\nApple told The Verge it was aware of the issue that was affecting \"customers in a small number of cases.\" A fix will be included in an upcoming software update. However, the tech giant didn't mention when the fix will be rolled out to customers. It's well known that Apple issues multiple software updates in the weeks following the launch of its new phones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company released the iOS 11.0.1 update that brings performance improvements. The update also fixed bugs that affected the Exchange and Outlook.com account users when sending emails through the Mail app. Apple has also promised to push out a software update for the Apple Watch Series 3. A bug in the new Apple Watch causes it to connect to unauthenticated WiFi networks, which could lead to serious problems for users.\n\niPhone 8 Plus has the world's best smartphone camera\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are minor upgrades over last year's models. The new phones feature wireless charging and a faster A11 Bionic chip, though they retain the design of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Apple has also improved the new iPhones' camera. The iPhone 8 Plus has a 12MP wide-angle lens with an f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with an f/2.8 aperture. The company has added Portrait Lighting to the iPhone 8 Plus camera.\n\nCamera testing firm DxOMark recently said that the iPhone 8 Plus had the best smartphone camera they had ever tested. The 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus scored 94 out of 100 points. It was closely followed by the iPhone 8 with 92 points. Google Pixel and HTC U11, both of which were at the top before the iPhone 8 debut, had scored 90 points each.\n\nSeparately, IHS Markit estimates that the bill of materials for the new iPhones is higher than their predecessors. According to the research firm, the regular iPhone 8's component cost is $247.51 for the 64GB storage model, up from $237.94 for the 32GB iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 sells for $699 compared to the iPhone 7's starting price of $649. Component costs for the larger iPhone 8 Plus are $288.08 for the 64GB version. It is higher than the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus's $270.88. The iPhone 8 Plus has a starting price of $799.\n\niPhone 8 sales not weak, says Ming-Chi Kuo\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus didn't see the same level of pre-orders, sales, and consumer enthusiasm as the flagship models released in previous years. Most potential buyers have decided to hold out for the iPhone X rather than buying iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. There were no long queues in front of Apple Stores during the opening weekend, neither were online pre-orders great.\n\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in his latest note to investors that the Wall Street and media went insane about the lower than expected iPhone 8 sales. Kuo said that based on Apple's iPhone 8 production and research data from Localytics, the market has been \"excessively negative\" on the iPhone 8. The analyst said the iPhone 8 sales were \"stable\" rather than weak.\n\nKuo said production for the 2017 models would be split 50:50 between the iPhone X and the iPhone 8/8 Plus. Apple had factored it into production plans. According to data from Localytics, the combined first-weekend adoption rate for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus appears about half of the iPhone 7/7 Plus and the iPhone 6S/6S Plus. It's because the iPhone X is not included, not because the iPhone 8 sales are weak.\n\nThe iPhone X is scheduled to hit the store shelves on November 3. However, it will be short supply through this year.\n\nTags: Apple iPhone 8", "A couple of reports from Taiwan and Japan bring bad news about the iPhone 8. Apparently, at least two iPhone 8 Plus shipped with damaged batteries that ended up causing the devices to crack open.\n\nBefore you ask, no, the batteries did not explode. But they did swell up, which is a safety mechanism meant to prevent actual battery explosions and fires.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the battery to swell up, and accidents do happen with any device powered by a battery, iPhones included. The fact it just happened to brand new iPhone 8 units is obviously a red flag for Apple, which will investigate the incidents.\n\nImage Source: iFeng\n\nAccording to cnBeta, a Taiwanese woman who just purchased a 64GB iPhone 8 Plus charged the device using the original cable and adaptor.

And the display is the most likely component to be affected by a battery that swells up.\n\nIt appears the battery inside the iPhone 8 Plus is made by Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), The Next Web says, citing unconfirmed reports. ATL was one of the two suppliers of faulty Galaxy Note 7 batteries that Samsung threw under the bus in early 2017. However, that shouldn't be a cause for concern, as long as these are isolated incidents. After all, the Galaxy Note 7 explosions were caused by Samsung's faulty design, not the companies building the batteries.", "Skip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSETECH TIPS AND NEWS Facebook can help you find Wi-Fi? | 0:39\n\nFacebook is creating features in the current version of their app that will help its users find Wi-Fi hotspots.

Unlike the iPhone, many Android phones have the ability to expand the base memory, so if you have a micro SD expansion card loaded with music and pictures, everything may not fit on a base-model iPhone.\n\nApple charges $100 to $150 as a premium to go from its base model to the expanded memory options depending upon the model you're buying.\n\nBase models either come with 32GBs or 64GBs, so make sure you've done the math to figure out what will make it over.\n\nDeleting the items on your Android phone that don't need to transfer before you get started will make the transfer process less complicated, especially if you're dealing with too much content to transfer.\n\nAlso, be sure you have the latest version of iTunes on your computer as well, as this will be your main management console for the iPhone once you're done with the transfer.\n\nMove to iOS App\n\nSeveral years ago with the launch of the iPhone 6, Apple released an Android app called 'Move to iOS' (https://goo.gl/1hsNYy) to help switchers with the process.\n\nIt's far from perfect, but it does take a lot of what used to be a manual process out of the equation. (Instructions here)\n\nThe app only works if you're transferring to an iPhone that has yet to be set up, so if you've already started using yours, you'll either need to reset it (which wipes everything off) or move everything over manually. (https://goo.gl/JJHukR)\n\nThere are many limitations to what it can transfer over as well as the lack of converting various media files, so if things like auto-conversion of your music and videos, attachments in text messages, call logs, ringtones and other random files are important to you, it may be worth buying a program called AnyTrans.\n\nAnyTrans, which uses your computer with both phones plugged in to get the job done, also lets you avoid having to reset your iPhone if you've already started using it.\n\nManaging your expectations\n\nDespite all of the advancements made in transfer options, you're still likely to run into issues or glitches, so be prepared for a period of adjustments.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that all the apps available for the Android aren't necessarily available for the iPhone and purchased apps often have to be repurchased from Apple.\n\nIf you use a lot of Google's services, simply adding the iOS app for each and signing into your account should make everything \"automagically\" appear on your new iPhone.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2yzboZx", "According to the video, the upcoming flagship from Huawei is \"not a smartphone.\" It also says the device will be so smart that it'll \"think for us.\"\n\nAs we approach October 16, we are learning more about the upcoming Mate 10-branded smartphones day by day. So far, we've seen what seemed like leaked slideshows, purportedly showing images of the Mate 10 and the Mate 10 Pro. Rumors suggest that the Pro version could sport a bezel-less design, 4,000 mAh battery, all-new camera sensors, and of course, advanced AI features.\n\nThe AI part is where things get interesting. The Chinese electronics giant has previously stated that its upcoming flagship - presumably called the Mate 10 - will be \"more powerful\" than the recently-released iPhones. It even made fun of the Face ID technology found inside the iPhone X, claiming that the Mate 10 will be the \"real AI smartphone.\" These are certainly bold claims, but one thing is for sure: Huawei is not taking AI lightly. The company has already discussed its plans to launch an application processor that combines CPU, GPU, and AI functions, and although it's unclear whether that'll debut with the Mate 10, from the latest teaser, it's clear AI is going to play a big role in the upcoming device:\n\nHuawei says that the Mate 10 \"is not a smartphone\" but rather \"an intelligent machine.\" Then it proceeds, \"This sees, thinks, learns like us [and] for us.\" On one hand, I can't wait to see what Huawei has in store for us. My guess is that the AI here is mainly referring to the Neural Processing Unit that the company has been talking about and photography-related features (Apple seems to be taking a similar approach). On the other hand, however, I'm a little creeped out by the fact that I'm so excited for a phone that's going to \"think for me.\"\n\nI'm a little creeped out by the fact that I'm so excited for a phone that's going to 'think for me.'\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the new teaser?

Does it matter?\n\nIBM now employs 130,000 people in India - about a third of its total work force - and \"well under 100,000 people at its American offices,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAs recently as 2002, IBM only employed about 6,000 people in India, so it has been hiring roughly 8,000 a year. Also in 2002, IBM employed around 160,000 people in the USA. This had been reduced to 105,000 in 2009, when IBM stopped providing numbers. What it is today is anyone's guess. While there have been various lay-offs, IBM has also added staff by buying more than 150 companies.\n\nThe change to \"Indian Business Machines\" has hit the news because Times tech reporter Vindu Goel got an interview with Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the IBM's Indian operations, in Bangalore. However, the transition may have happened five years ago. In 2012, for example, Computerworld suggested that \"In a symbolic shift, IBM's India workforce likely exceeds U.S.\" This story was based on an internal document that IBM refused to confirm.\n\nEither way, the shift is not surprising, for three reasons. First, India produces a lot of English-speaking computer science graduates willing to work for much lower wages than American programmers. Second, the USA has been restricting immigration from India and other countries, so many have been working under temporary H-1B visas. Third, India is trying to build its own technology industry, under prime minister Narendra Modi's flagship Digital India project. This should encourage more of the country's best technologists to work in or return to India.\n\nIndia's technology industry boomed on outsourcing through companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro. More recently, it moved into web and then smartphone app development, which is one of the things it does for IBM.\n\nAs Goel reports: \"IBM even has a Bangalore 'garage' full of app designers who build corporate iPhone and iPad apps to simplify tasks like helping airline agents rebook passengers, bankers make loans and doctors update patient files.\"\n\nThe real question is whether it has done IBM any good.\n\nIBM has now suffered 21 quarters in a row of declining revenues, and its 2016 turnover of $79.92 billion is less than it was in 1998 ($81.67bn). This is a wretched performance in a market where companies like Apple, Google and Facebook have come from almost, or literally, nothing.\n\nIf you believe the message boards where former and some current IBM employees hang out, this is partly the result of replacing highly-skilled but highly-paid, experienced and productive senior employees with low-skilled, lower-paid and less productive junior employees, whether based in India or not.\n\nThat may well be true, but it's only one of many factors in IBM's long-term decline....", "The company that started as a secret Netflix Inc. (NFLX) project to build hardware that could stream media to televisions no longer thinks those gadgets are the key to its Wall Street success.\n\nRoku Inc. (ROKU) made its debut Thursday after raking in at least $219 million in an initial public offering that valued the company at roughly $1.3 billion, and shares zoomed nearly 68% higher than the $14 IPO price to close at $23.50. In morning trading Friday, shares jumped again to more than double the IPO price, suggesting investors have taken to the company even after it failed to raise private capital at a $1.5 billion valuation earlier this year.\n\nClick here to see the latest share price for ROKU\n\nRoku is largely known for its line of TV streaming sticks and devices, but executives say that the future lies in money generated from what people use the gadgets for: consuming content. Roku is staking its growth on its dedicated TV and streaming device operating system, described as \"platform\" revenue in company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that showed sales growth of 91% in the first six months of 2017 from the previous year.\n\n\"What's important in the evolution of the company is the platform business is becoming a greater and greater portion of Roku,\" Chief Financial Officer Steven Louden told MarketWatch in a telephone interview Thursday. \"It's now 80% of our gross profit and I think it's great proof-point for investors about really what the Roku business model is about.\"\n\nDon't miss: Roku IPO: Five things to know about the streaming-device company.\n\nThe company generates revenue from its streaming operating system in three ways: It sells ads, which make up about two-thirds of the current platform sales, and has revenue-sharing agreements for content and subscriptions purchased via its operating system, according to Louden. A final 5% comes from licensing the technology to others.\n\n\"[Licensing fees are] probably the place that has the most significant revenue recognition around it,\" Louden said. \"Our licensing fees -- we have multiyear deals with TV brands as well as service operators through our Roku Power program. We actually have almost $70 million in deferred revenue on the balance sheet, which is a lot of value.\"\n\nAs the software side of the business grows at a near triple-digit clip, hardware sales dipped 2% to $117.3 million in the first six months of 2017 compared with last year. But Roku doesn't see what it calls \"player\" revenue as a profit driver, Louden says, but rather a way to attract new customers to its platform.\n\n\"We focus on overall profit growth at Roku,\" he said. \"We are making a strategic trade off between the player segment and the platform segment because we are not trying to maximize for player revenue....We look at the player segment as a customer-acquisition path as opposed to thinking like a hardware company and needing to maximize revenue on that.\"\n\nRoku's focus on the software ecosystem echoes the sentiments of other hardware startups that have made it to Wall Street, like GoPro Inc. (GPRO) and Fitbit Inc. (FIT) It is a path that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has shown to be possible, as the iPhone maker's software and services revenues have continued to grow even as sales growth for its hardware has stalled.\n\nFitbit seeks software success like Apple Fitbit CEO talked to MarketWatch about the new software updates it launched at CES 2017. In an effort to enhance the experience for users and keep them on its platform, Fitbit's new social component helps users manage their diet and exercise.\n\nIPO experts are closely watching the company's non-device revenue and give credit to executives for recognizing that hardware was not the path to Roku's most promising future.\n\n\"What [executives] were able to do was recognize their hardware business model was not a long-term smashing success and manage to change, and not to have a giant dip in the process moving from the hardware to the platform and have some decent margins along the way,\" said Barrett Daniels, Chief Executive of Nextstep, a San Francisco company that helps private firms go public. \"The good part of the business is really growing.\"\n\nDaniels says he was pleasantly surprised by the company's S-1 filing because, unlike some other recent tech IPOs such as Snap Inc. (SNAP) , executives didn't give themselves massive stock grants, their financials appear to be \"well-managed\" and the company went public at the right time.\n\n\"Unlike Evan Spiegel at Snap -- large stock grants are actually pretty common -- the executives don't seem to be robbing the place. I think they've done a very responsible job.\"\n\nRoku's debut comes at time when the market for IPOs appears to be improving. The total number of IPOs this year has already surpassed the total number of deals completed for all of 2016. What's different about Roku's IPO is that investors in the private companies look to have missed an opportunity, passing on a chance to invest at a $1.5 billion valuation.\n\n\"Public investors seem to be the smart ones,\" Daniels said. \"They were able to recognize good fundamentals and good future prospects. Private market investors are the dumb ones, meaning they had a chance to invest in this six months ago and they passed. I think this is a new sort of world we're living in.\"\n\nRoku's IPO also arrives at a good time for technology companies, as the SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded fund (XLK) has rallied 5.2% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index (SPX) has gained 2.8%.\n\nRoku (ROKU) sold at least 9 million shares in the IPO for $126 million, and selling stockholders Menlo Ventures and Sky Ventures Ltd. combined to sell 6.7 million shares. Underwriters have access to 2.35 million more shares, which would be split between the company and selling stockholders if they are sold.", "SpaceX founder and billionaire Elon Musk has revealed that people could be transported around the world on most long-distance trips in under one hour using a new spacecraft he's designed and codenamed \"BFR\", understood to stand for \"Big F---ing Rocket\".\n\nMusk's plan was unveiled in a highly-anticipated public presentation he gave in Adelaide on Friday afternoon at the International Astronautical Congress, in which he updated the world's space industry on his plans to build a colony on Mars and a lunar base on the Moon.\n\nMore Tech Talk Videos Previous slide Next slide SpaceX launches first rocket after ...

A huge line was seen outside the Adelaide Convention Centre, where the congress was being held.\n\nSecurity was tight and parts of the conference centre were locked down before Musk's presentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne member of the public complained to the registration desk that it would cost more than $1000 to see Musk, which, he said, \"seemed a little unfair\".\n\nBut the truth of the matter was that this was the registration cost to attend the week-long conference.\n\nWhile the main focus of Musk's presentation was the BFR's ability to be used as a spacecraft to transport humans to Mars and the Moon by 2022 (cargo) and 2024 (cargo and crew), he surprised the audience when he said it could also be used to transport people Earth-to-Earth, with most long-distance trips occurring in under 30 minutes. While Sydney to London would take 51 minutes, other routes would take 30 minutes or less, he said.\n\n\"There is something else,\" Musk said, before showing a video of Earth-to-Earth BFR travel.\n\nIt felt like the 46-year-old billionaire's late Steve Jobs \"one more thing\" moment.\n\n\"If you build a ship that is capable of going to Mars, what if you take that spaceship and flew it from one place on Earth to another?

So, we did that\n\nElon Musk\n\nMusk said most of what the BFR would be used for is long-distance trips and would do them \"in less than half an hour.\"\n\nThe BFR could fly people from Los Angeles to Toronto in 24 mins; Los Angeles to New York in 25 mins; Los Angeles to Honolulu in 25 mins; and Bangkok to Dubai in 27 mins.\n\nMusk said it could also be used to dock with the International Space Station, in addition to being used to get cargo and people to Mars and the Moon.\n\n\"It's a little bit big but it will work,\" Musk said of it next to the ISS.\n\n\"We travel 27,000kmh or roughly 18,000 mph.This is where the propulsive landing becomes very important.The great thing about going to space is there is no friction,\" Musk said.\n\n\"So once you are out of the atmosphere there's no atmosphere. And you can get to most long-distance places like I said in less than half an hour. And if we are building this thing [the BFR] to go to the Moon and Mars then why not go to other places on Earth as well?\"\n\nA crowd member shouted, \"We love you Elon\".\n\nMusk replied, \"thank you\" before walking off the stage without taking questions.\n\nIn other news, SpaceX said the BFR was also capable of transporting satellites to orbit, crew and cargo to the International Space Station, and completing missions to the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also announced that its Falcon 9 rocket had completed 16 successful landings.\n\nWhen people looked shocked at Musk's ambitious timeline to get to Mars, he replied, \"That's not a typo. But it is aspiration.\"", "We are in a moment between techno-rapture and techno-panic. For the last couple of decades we were in such reverential awe of the new technology firms that we allowed them to do as they pleased. Big Tech - Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter - could do no wrong.\n\nOur state of techo-rapture allowed them to get busy doing and enabling things that no one else was allowed: the plundering of our personal data, the exploitation of our intellectual property, the avoidance of our tax laws. They provided platforms that allowed Islamic State to organise attacks on our societies and recruit new terrorists from our suburbs. They stood by as hostile governments used their systems to undermine our democracies.\n\nWhat did we do? For a long time we stood back and applauded. Like the peoples and governments of most Western democracies, Australians fell for the techno-utopian propaganda pumped out of Silicon Valley and Wall Street and the advertising and marketing departments of the firms themselves. These companies were special, they were the future, they were limitless and we shouldn't be Lilliputian-minded enough to try to impose conventional limits on them.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party, itself a master of propaganda, calls such manipulation \"thought work\". It's no coincidence that China has banned Google. And Facebook. Or that Apple made a great show of defying the US government's demand that it open a terrorist's phone for investigators but quietly buckles to Chinese demands. Last month, for instance, it removed from its China app store over 400 apps that allow users to skirt government filters. The Chinese, tougher-minded, simply didn't fall into the same swoon.\n\nRelated Articles The great Australian tradition we must not forget The reassuring message in the German and NZ elections\n\nWe have started to snap out of the rapture. Slowly, Western governments, other industries and some citizens have grasped that Big Tech may be ruthless transnational corporate greed in a new guise, but it is ruthless transnational corporate greed nonetheless.\n\nWestern governments, including Australia's, have started to demand that they shut out terrorists from their systems. We've started to demand that they pay their taxes. They're being called before multiple inquiries in the US Congress to explain why they allowed the Russian government to use their platforms to manipulate the US election campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother of the Big Tech outfits, Uber, had grown so accustomed to operating with impunity that it was shocked when the City of London last week banned it. Uber was not \"fit and proper\", transport authorities said. It was a sign of the times.\n\nAnd this slow awakening is happening just in time for us to be hit with the next meta-trend in the popular psychology of technological change. Robots and artificial intelligence are going to take our jobs and steal our futures. It's the old Luddite techno-phobia. But it's now being repeated to us so often, with such conviction, that it's starting to create great anxiety.\n\nAs my colleague Ross Gittins wrote a few weeks ago: \"You'd have to have been hiding under a rock not to know that 40 per cent of jobs in Australia - about 5 million of them - are likely to be automated in the next 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nThis is because it was the headline finding of a much-publicised 2015 report by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. Got that? Forty per cent of jobs will disappear. So when Australians aged 18-36 were asked about their work futures, guess what proportion thought that automation posed a threat to their jobs? Forty per cent, according to the Deloitte Millennial Survey this year. Similar studies of the job-stealing potential of robots and artificial intelligence in other countries have come to similar conclusions. Forty, fifty, sixty per cent of jobs will be displaced by smart machines and self-teaching software.\n\nBarack Obama's farewell speech in January stoked the fear: \"The next wave of economic dislocation won't come from overseas,\" he intoned. \"It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.\"\n\n\"Intelligent machines: The jobs robots will steal first\" was the headline on a BBC story, typical of the genre, that ran earlier this month. It ran through a list - factory worker, doctor, cocktail waitress, journalist, taxi driver. The anxiety is building. Techno-panic beckons. But is it well founded?\n\nGittins pointed out the flaw in any economic modelling - your results are only as good as your assumptions. In other words, \"garbage in, garbage out\". He cited economists shooting holes in the basis of the CEDA research. And research by the Paris-based OECD estimated that, across the developed countries, a much smaller 9 per cent of jobs were vulnerable. But this is such a speculative exercise that you can choose your study and pick your number. The McKinsey Global Institute, for instance, estimates that only 5 per cent of occupations will be able to be fully automised by 2065. But it reckons that about half of the activities within occupations will be automatable. So, 95 per cent of occupations will remain but the work within will change. Over the next half-century. You can see why this study didn't get as much publicity as the apocalyptic ones - jobs will change over the next 50 years, nothing too shocking, not many hurt. Hardly a sexy news story.\n\nBut the most important counter to the panic is the evidence of the past three centuries. As each wave of technological change has hit, from the agricultural revolution to the industrial to the digital, many job categories have indeed been wiped out. But many more have been created. So that there has been a net gain every time.The simple fact is that we can always see jobs disappearing but we can never imagine the jobs that will arise in their place.\n\nAustralia should be able to take further reassurance from its recent experiences. Two in particular. First was the 1980s wave of economic reform under the Hawke-Keating governments. As they tore down the tariff wall that had protected Australian industry for a century, we were beset by hysteria. It would mean the death of Australia's manufacturing sector and national ruin. And the end of protectionism did wipe out great swathes of Australia's factories, jobs lost by the tens of thousands. Manufacturing's share of the economy today is half its level of the Hawke-Keating revolution. But rather than national ruin it led to national rejuvenation.\n\nPaul Keating was asked in 2000 what he'd say to blue-collar workers who lost their jobs as a result of his reforms. \"What do I say: What is your new job like? One of the 2.5 million created since the early 1980s. People have found better jobs. I mean, did we ever hurt anybody liberating them from the car assembly line?\"\n\nSecond was the mining boom that ended some four years ago. Every previous Australian mining boom has ended in a bad bust, a national recession. The mighty convulsions in an economy riding a mining boom are like a cowboy trying to hang on to a wildly bucking brumby. This latest boom was the biggest in two centuries of European settlement yet it was the first that did not end in a bust. The newfound flexibility of the economy allowed a smooth dismount.\n\nAustralia has now enjoyed 26 years of unbroken growth, a record for any developed nation. Ah yes, say the prophets of doom, but the tech transformation that is about to hit is unique. This time it's different, they tell us. A book on the subject published this week by a federal Labor MP, Jim Chalmers, and the former head of the NBN, Mike Quigley, tells us so. How? \"Earlier evolutions replaced human effort\" but \"this one goes a step further to directly challenge some some intrinsic traits that make us human - thinking, problem-solving and decision-making\", they write in the book titled Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age.\n\nGratefully, however, this isn't an exercise in extended hysteria. Chalmers, the shadow finance minister, and Quigley don't waste their book making the ahistorical argument that this time, unlike all other experience, Chicken Little will be proved right and the sky truly will fall. They point out that the world's top experts are split down the middle on whether the new robotics will mean breakdown or boon for the next generations. They cite a survey of 1900 experts by the well-regarded Washington research institute, Pew. Of the experts, 48 per cent saw net job destruction, worsening income inequality, big pools of unemployable people and a breakdown in the social order in just the next eight years. So this time the revolution will be different, in their view.\n\nAnd the other 52 per cent? They foresaw people displaced from some jobs but that human ingenuity would produce new jobs and new industries. In other words, this time it's not different at all. Chalmers and Quigley have chosen not to take sides. Instead, their book, cogent and clear, takes a \"no regrets\" approach to the future.\n\nThey set out 33 policy recommendations that are designed to make Australia a better place regardless of whether the new robots turn out to be benign or bastards. Most of their recommendations are sensible and can indeed be taken up with \"no regrets\". They advocate that we should train more teachers in the STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. And that all states should take up Queensland's \"digital solutions\" curriculum.\n\nRefreshingly, they urge that we sharpen communication skills and critical thinking by promoting debating, drama and advocacy. More venturesome ideas are that Australia should implement lifelong learning accounts, lifelong learning programs like Singapore's SkillsFuture initiative, portable worker entitlements and \"income smoothing\" to better distribute our incomes across our working lifetimes.\n\nSome of their suggestions merely show up the failures of Australia's dismal politics - they recommend, for instance, the implementation of universal high speed national broadband and the introduction of needs-based schools funding. Both of these were supposed to have been substantially delivered already and might have been but for the awful partisan politics of Canberra.\n\nLabor and the left of politics in Australia need to be careful in their embrace of this theme. If they use it as a Trojan horse for intervening in the economy through reregulation of the workplace or other big government intrusions, they will quickly meet the resistance of the Coalition and the right. This would end in yet more bitter brawling and turn a sensible reform opportunity into a national failure. But Chalmers and Quigley have made a good start to a sensible approach.

It will be used by coaches and broadcasters to track player performance.\n\nRelated Articles Australia can play a role in 'second space age' Zoox is coming out of the shadows as it enters 'Godzilla mode'\n\nBoth teams participating the NRL grand final, the North Queensland Cowboys and the Melbourne Storm, use a version of it too.\n\nYet the S5's significance goes beyond this weekend's big games: it has underpinned one of the more interesting stories in Australian business for a while now. And the company behind it, Catapult Group, offers a glimpse at what the future of commerce in this country could look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatapult Group listed on the ASX in 2014. It is currently valued at about $200 million, and employs over 300 people. It has come along way in a relatively short time, but has even bigger ambitions. It has publicly stated a goal to eventually become a multibillion-dollar tech giant.\n\n\"We are a high-growth company,\" chief executive Joe Powell tells Fairfax Media.\n\n\"If we execute our strategy, we believe that we will continue to grow, and that will result in a significantly higher market capitalisation than what we have today.\"\n\nTo realise that goal, Catapult will need to make a risky leap from being a provider of technology to elite athletes to selling things to mere mortals in the mass market.\n\nIt will also need to restore faith with investors badly burned by some of its recent decisions.\n\nAdelaide Crows star Eddie Betts will have his every move measured.\n\nAnd it will need to convince them that its plan to pursue growth before short-term profit (a strategy Australian investors are often uncomfortable with) is the right one.\n\nThe new economy\n\nIf you wanted to draw up a vision for what for an Australian company designed for the new global economy might look like, it would probably resemble Catapult, or at least share some of its traits.\n\nSpawned out of two government agencies, it's a relatively rare example of a business successfully commercialising the world-class research this country is known to churn out. CSL is another.\n\nCrucially, it's also a lifestyle business that harnesses some of Australia's defining attributes - our obsession with fitness, and our relatively high levels of participation in sport.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is an export success story. Some of the world's best known athletes are users, and some of the world's best known sporting teams are paying customers.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys use Catapult's technology. Photo: AP\n\nAcross the Pacific in the US, NFL teams such as the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons are also clients. So too are European soccer giants like Chelsea FC and Borussia Dortmund. All up it has 1500 elite teams on its books.\n\nCatapult Group's flagship product is the S5. Canaccord Genuity analyst Owen Humphries estimates they cost about $195 per month under the company's subscription model, and are used by about 900 teams to measure performance and reduce the risk of injuries.\n\nThe company has cheaper tracking devices, and has also developed an indoor tracking system that has been installed in 16 stadiums around the world, including the Etihad in Melbourne.\n\nThrough recent acquisitions it is expanding into video analytics for teams, and selling data to media companies. Look out for a player tracker sponsored by Telstra during the AFL grand final. (It powered a similar feature during this year's State of Origin series.)\n\nBut Catapult's imminent push into cheaper devices for more mainstream consumers could be its riskiest and most ambitious move yet.\n\nA brief history\n\nCatapult was founded in 2006 by Shaun Holthouse and Igor van de Griendt, two engineers who had worked on a federal government research grant program with the Australian Institute of Sport on early micro-technologies.\n\nCatapult Sports exec chairman Adir Shiffman (left) and founder Shaun Holthouse. Photo: Josh Robenstone\n\nBarely a year in they'd signed up their first AFL team (Hawthorn). In 2011, they opened a US office, and had signed up their first NFL team (the Jacksonville Jaguars) and their first US top division college football team.\n\nBy 2013 they were supplying most of Australia's sports teams and many offshore teams with GPS tracking devices. But growth was slowing. So Adir Shiffman, a qualified medical doctor and serial tech start-up founder, was installed as executive chairman.\n\nShiffman swiftly set about trying to raise funds to launch a deeper assault on the lucrative and much bigger US market. Yet, even though this was only a few years ago, the climate for fundraising by small tech firms with scant revenue, let alone profit, was vastly different.\n\n\"We tried to raise $10 million. Forget about that,\" recounts Shiffman.\n\n\"No one would give us a cent. We took the whole of 2013, couldn't raise any money. I'm friends with all of the VC people. They all passed. You name them.\"\n\nThe funding freeze for early-stage tech companies in Australia has thawed since then. But the reasons Catapult failed to secure backing remain telling.\n\n\"It was the times, it was a businesss people didn't really understand, it was a market size Australian investors couldn't really get their heads around,\" says Shiffman.\n\nIn early 2014 the company managed to scrounge together $3.5 million from family and friends.\n\nSoon after, Shiffman's relentless networking and overtures in America paid off. Mark Cuban, the billionaire internet entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks (who'd been using Catapult's technology), came on board as an adviser and investor. \"That transformed our credibility in the US,\" says Shiffman.\n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's investment in Catapult was a game changer. Photo: Evan Vucci\n\nWith Cuban's support, Catapult gathered momentum in the world's biggest economy. By the end of 2014, 14 NFL teams, 10 NBA teams and the reigning college football champions (Florida State) were customers.\n\nThat gave the company confidence to proceed with an IPO on the ASX. The float was a success, but to say that it has been a tumultuous ride since then would be an understatement.\n\nLess than a year into the company's listed existence, the AFL awarded a contract for GPS tracking and player data to Champion Data, a company the league holds a 49 per cent interest in.\n\nThe damage to Catapult was relatively shortlived - individual AFL teams revolted, and an agreement was struck for them to be able to remain customers.\n\nThe share price subsequently recovered, and went on a tear. In mid 2016 it hit a peak at $4, valuing the business at more than $500 million.\n\nSince then the descent has been steady.\n\nIn July last year, the company raised $100 million in fresh capital to shore up its balance sheet and fund two acquisitions designed to diversify its business. These were XOS, a Boston-based video analytics provider for many sports teams, and PlayerTek, an Irish firm that makes cheaper GPS tracking devices designed for amateur, but still serious, athletes.\n\nThis year, it has posted a loss of $13.5 million, launched another equity raising, and pledged to invest for growth.\n\nThese moves caught the market off guard, and investors hit the stock price.\n\nAll up it has fallen 70 per cent since its mid 2016 peak. And anyone who tipped money into either of the last two capital raisings is deep underwater.\n\nThe problem with wearables\n\nLayered above these challenges is another significant problem: wearable device makers have been a graveyard for investors. That could pose issues for Catapult as it attempts to become a more consumer-facing company.\n\nFitbit has struggled since its float. Photo: Supplied\n\nFitbit, one of the early market leaders in wearables, made it on to the US sharemarket through an IPO in 2015 but has struggled since then. Revenue has been shrinking, losses have deepened, and the share price has sunk.\n\nJawbone, a heavily hyped maker of wearable fitness-tracking bracelets, has all but gone out of business. The company, which raised nearly $US600 million from venture capital investors, and which was at one point valued at $US3.3 billion, started liquidating assets in July.\n\nThe reason why no one seems to be able to make the wearable device business work? In a word - Apple.\n\nPeople seem either content to use their phone for the types of things cheaper fitness trackers can do, or if they are prepared to spend a bit more money, they buy an Apple Watch.\n\nApple unveiled a new model watch and is pushing hard into wearable tech. Photo: Timothy Fadek\n\n\u200b\"The wearables sector is being dominated globally by Apple,\" says Foad Fadaghi, managing director of tech analysis firm Telsyte. Repeat purchases of devices made by the likes of Jawbone and Fitbit are extremely low, he says.\n\n\"One reason we believe is that many were given as unwanted gifts. There is also design concerns and lack of features and integration.\"\n\nThese are not problems Catapult faces with its elite products. They have features aplenty, and are not being abandoned by customers.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of the company's products are now sold on a subscription basis to elite teams. The \"churn rate\" (the proportion of users who quit after their contract expires) is less than 2 per cent, a level described by Canaccord's Humphries as \"exceptionally low\".\n\nCatapult also has a strategy more considered than those of other wearables companies. \u200bFor its consumer expansion, which is scheduled to ramp up in 2018, it is targeting sub-elite or \"prosumer\" athletes: people who take their sport pretty seriously but aren't paid professionals.\n\nCatapult is targeting high-level amateurs in competitions such as the VFL. Photo: Chris Hopkins\n\nIn an Australian context, this basically means the highest levels of amateur sport in each code (think VFL, or club rugby in Sydney).\n\nIn the US, it would mean smaller college teams, and high school teams, of which there are many. The company estimates there are 440,000 high school athletes in the US playing soccer seriously, and over 1 million high school athletes playing American football, who could be drawn to its prosumer offerings.\n\n\"We think it's an attractive market to go after,\" says Powell.\n\nPreviously a senior executive at Seek who joined as chief executive in April, Powell says Catapult's links to pro teams give it advantages over rival wearables makers.\n\n\"If you look at some of the offerings in the market, they don't have that authentic connection to elite teams,\" he says.\n\nHe likens the company's intended offerings to Garmin's Edge cycling products which have been successful with serious, but not professional, cyclists.\n\nIn the US, a fierce debate is raging about the safety of American football, amid evidence concussions prevalent in the sport lead to lasting brain damage. Participation in the most popular sport in the US at youth levels has been falling. More broadly, there are concerns kids are turning away from sport to play video games.\n\nDebate is raging in America about the effects of concussion. Photo: AP\n\nBut Powell is not concerned.\n\n\"Fundamentally these sports are ingrained in these countries,\" he says. \"And there is a whole generation of kids coming through who want to know how they are going, to compare themselves to other teams and kids and track their progresss.\"\n\nThe way forward\n\nThe analyst community remains upbeat about Catapult's prospects, despite its recent share price slump.\n\nCanaccord's Humphries says \"prosumer\" is a huge opportunity for Catapult that could \"add another layer of growth to the business\".\n\nHe estimates it's a market 10 to 20 times the size of the elite sports market, with the potential for as many as 2 million devices to be sold. (For comparison, Catapult currently has fewer than 14,000 units under subscription.)\n\n\"Catapult competes in a large and fast growing sports analytics industry with significant barriers to entry and a technological advantage over its competitors, in our view, that is likely to drive revenue growth over the medium term,\" he wrote in a research note.\n\nIvor Ries, an analyst at Morgans, claims Catapult is \"back on track\" after a year of disruption caused by heavy investment and acquisitions.\n\n\"The company is a world leader in elite athletics devices and analytics and continues to invest aggressively in growing its global user base,\" he recently told clients. \"The market opportunity ahead of Catapult remains large and the company has shown a strong ability to execute.\"\n\nFor his part, Shiffman is philosophical about the share price volatility.\n\n\"It's so weird, there is no way a company that was worth $10 million at the start of 2014 was worth $60 at the end [of 2014], and worth $500 million a year and a half later. It just shows the inefficiency of markets' ability to price the value of an asset,\" he says.\n\nShiffman points out there is still room for the company to grow its elite offering. Only about 10 per cent of the world's elite teams are using GPS tracking systems. Yet prosumer could be an even bigger opportunity.\n\n\"This is an offering whose time has come,\" says Shiffman of the company's prosumer push. \"And Catapult is positioned in ways that no other company in the world is to make this [work].\"\n\nIt won't be on the minds of Dustin Martin, Eddie Betts or anyone tuning into this weekend's grand finals. But Australians should keep an eye on Catapult's progress.\n\nAt a time when anxiety over our post-mining boom, post-property boom future is building, its story suggests we can still produce innovative products. The question is whether we can still produce great, sustainable companies.", "Is it too late for Uber to survive its internal storm, or will its new CEO prove to be the hero it needs?\n\nIt has been several weeks since Dara Khosrowshahi succeeded Travis Kalanick as Uber's CEO. In that time, the deluge of negative headlines has not stopped. More lawsuits have been filed, as well as more accusations of discrimination and misogyny. Even if Khosrowshahi has an overblown hero complex, he must be wondering what he signed up for.\n\nUber is in chaos to a degree that few companies ever find themselves. It is the largest privately held tech company, with a brand that is internationally recognizable, and because it has become part of global culture, their consumers care about the headlines. It does not help that the vultures are circling -- Lyft is actively working to grab jaded Uber customers, and reporters are scrambling to break the next Uber scandal.\n\nBut Uber's biggest problem is not one that consumes the headlines. Uber has a culture problem.\n\nRelated: Uber's New CEO Takes a New Approach, Apologizing for the Company's Past Mistakes\n\n\"Corporate culture is indelibly linked to an organization's brand,\" Deb Gabor writes for Fortune. She goes on to say, \"When your culture is in distress, so is your brand. It's been well acknowledged that Uber has a sick corporate culture that's persisted unchecked by leadership for many years.\"\n\nA sick corporate culture can become malignant when under constant pressure, as Uber has been for the last year. Resurrecting the organization from its tailspin will require visionary leadership that firmly grasps how to invigorate teams of people far from headquarters and redirect attention to the future.\n\nAviv Shahar, founder, and CEO of Aviv Consulting, described the tailspin problem in terms of winning and losing to me over a chat in my Facebook group for entrepreneurs. \"Uber has a winning problem. Yes, they are still the number one ridesharing company in the world, but the Uber team has been rocked by successive scandals for so long that it will need help getting its mojo back. You act differently when you're winning, and it is time for Uber to start winning again. Today's shape-shifting environment is so competitive that no company is secure at the top. An industry leader that loses the wind in its sails can only coast for so long before it loses its grip on the market. Khosrowshahi needs a plan to score some early wins.\"\n\nKalanick, for all his faults, was a winner. In five short years, he built a global empire, conquered adversaries, advanced new technologies and is credited for jump-starting a whole new kind of economy -- the sharing economy. But Uber is short on wins right now. Even its initiatives such sa self-driving cars and Uber Rush are falling on hard times.\n\nRelated: The Guy at the Center of Uber and Google's Legal Battle Created a Church That Worships AI\n\nKhosrowshahi, if he is to be successful, needs to pull off a miracle. Is that a reasonable expectation? Actually, yes it is, and the best CEOs do it all the time. Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and released the iMac in 1998. Dan Hesse introduced \"Simplify Everything\" to save Sprint in 2008. Henry Ford, one of the original American business titans, doubled salaries in 1914, ignoring critics who said the move would bankrupt the company. In moments of crisis, good executives know how to create a win and change the narrative.\n\nIt goes without saying that your average executive would rather face a sales problem or a branding problem than the \"raging dumpster fire\" that is Uber right now. Solving the problems of culture and morale require finesse and thoughtful listening. It will also require taking calculated risks because Uber cannot afford to become a muted bureaucracy right now either.\n\n\"The new CEO will not succeed if the impending culture changes denude its startup mentality,\" Shahar asserts. \"The new leadership team must be comfortable playing at the edge, making calculated tweaks to make Uber a more inclusive workplace as well as one that embraces independence, initiative and innovation. It is not the only tech company navigating that minefield. Succeeding will necessarily include changing the conversation and casting a vision for a new future that the whole team can create together.\"\n\nRelated: 17 Things You Need to Know About Uber's New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\n\nUber's biggest problems are internal, but it does not have long to set those issues straight. Its external problems cannot wait forever, and those are not just the lawsuits and PR scandals. Uber is facing stiffer competition from rival companies at home and abroad, tighter regulations in Europe, and even revamped taxi companies trying to win back market share. Investors are not as bullish as they were a year ago and want to know what the exit might look like. Worst of all, the arms race to launch a self-driving fleet could bankrupt whoever comes in second place almost overnight.\n\nIt goes without saying that Uber will face those challenges with more agility and confidence if Khosrowshahi can first succeed in revamping the company's culture.", "According to a new security guideline issued by Apple, children and people who have a twin sibling should refrain from using the new Face ID unlock feature on their new iPhone X's. The guideline warns, \"The probability of a false match is different for twins and siblings that look like you as well as among children under the age of 13, because their distinct facial features may not have fully developed.\" The recommended alternative? A good old fashioned passcode.\n\nThe Guardian points out that Apple's been trying to figure out a way to defeat potential hackers who attempt to use masks or other methods to bypass Face ID security. They describe it as two individual systems, one programmed to recognize a user and function properly in that regard, and \"[an] additional neural network that's trained to spot and resist spoofing defends against attempts to unlock your phone with photos or masks.\" Leveraging a neural network against such hacking attempts is basically hedging a bet; Apple believes masks won't fool the first system, which should just recognize a false face when it sees one, but if it does get fooled, then that's where the neural network kicks in.\n\nIt's important to note that the biometric data they're using to recognize faces stays on the phone, and developers are explicitly not allowed to use that data to develop their own biometric recognition systems. That data is privileged, highly-sensitive information, and Apple wants to treat it as such. The Guardian did note that their developer guidelines were updated to reflect that, as they now read, \"You may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from depth and/or facial mapping tools.\"\n\nCriticism regarding Apple's new hardware offerings came swiftly, ranging from the humorous to the altogether worrying. As of right now, there are no laws barring law enforcement officers from using your own face to unlock your confiscated phone. The same goes for people who use Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint-scanning technology. The only way to ensure total security is, again, a passcode. And is there really such a thing as total security anymore?", "Apple already does the most end-to-end work of any company building smartphones. It has complete control over the physical design, codes all the software, and designs the CPU at the heart of every phone.\n\nBut it still relies heavily on outside companies to produce many of the critical components for its phones and laptops. That leads to differences in the quality of chips between different iPhones, and can also be a strategic problem when, say, one of your suppliers of baseband modems decides to sue you.\n\nThat's why today's report from Nikkei Asian Review, which claims that Apple is \"expanding efforts to develop proprietary semiconductors to better compete in artificial intelligence, reducing reliance on major suppliers such as Intel and Qualcomm,\" makes such perfect sense.\n\nNikkei says that \"Apple is keen to expand its semiconductor capabilities further. They say the company is interested in building core processors for notebooks, modem chips for iPhones, and a chip that integrates touch, fingerprint and display driver functions.\" Those are some of the components that have caused the most headaches for Apple.\n\nIn this year's iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, for example, Apple has different modems from Intel and Qualcomm in different versions of the phone. Qualcomm's modem (on paper at least) is more capable than Intel's, as it's compatible with gigabit LTE technologies like LTE-U, LAA, and 4\u00d74 MIMO. Intel's modem is more limited, so to ensure \"feature parity\" between the different models, Apple has had to artificially restrict Qualcomm's modem, and purposely make the new iPhones slower than their Android rivals.\n\nQualcomm is also in an ongoing legal battle with Apple, but Apple's reliance on the chip manufacturer for its iPhone supply restricts Apple's legal strategy in the fight. By designing its own chips, Apple could ensure that it gets the best technology in every new device, and reduces its reliance on rival corporations that could be a strategic threat.\n\nApple has already moved (via manufacturing partner Foxconn) to start producing its own screens going forward. It makes sense that as time passes, it will look down the list of vital components, and start trying to lock down the manufacturing process part by part.", "But competition and profitability could threaten the newly public company, Cramer adds.\n\nShares of streaming platform Roku surged after its Thursday initial public offering, so CNBC's Jim Cramer decided to find out if the company was fit for your portfolio.\n\n\"Judging by the strength of its IPO, there's a lot to like here. Roku's been growing at a solid clip, and [as] the maker of the No. 1 streaming platform, this may be the best single play on cord-cutting around,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But, and this is a big but, after doing a little digging, candidly, I have some serious reservations about the stock, at least at these prices.\"\n\nRoku pioneered the idea of streaming directly to your television. The company sells a small box that can access 4,500 different streaming channels including Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go.\n\nRoku also licenses its operating system to smart TV manufacturers and cable and satellite companies and has a bustling advertising business selling ad spots and brand sponsorships.\n\nCramer saw some clear positive to Roku's business model. First, the company is central to consumers who are opting out of traditional cable providers and moving to web-based content consumption. Plus, not only is Roku's user base accelerating, but users are progressively watching more and more content.\n\nSecond, while Roku competes with the likes of Google Chromecast, Amazon Alexa and Apple TV, all of its rivals are more focused on other segments of their businesses.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in Apple, but if you're buying it as a cord-cutting play, you are out of your mind because the Apple TV just isn't big enough to move the needle,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThird, the company has a solid balance sheet, and Cramer said the $126 million Roku raised in its IPO makes it look even better.\n\nBut Cramer had to consider the negatives. While Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google may not be laser-focused on their streaming products, being caught in their crosshairs hasn't exactly been a positive for companies, he said.\n\nMoreover, Roku's path to profitability doesn't seem crystal-clear. Its revenue may be growing, but the company has been losing money for some time and increasing competition from both the big dogs in tech and gaming consoles that stream video like PlayStation isn't exactly reassuring.\n\nThe company's also torn between two businesses: the platform it licenses, which now accounts for nearly half of Roku's sales, and the box it sells to consumers, sales of which decreased by 15 percent in the first quarter.\n\nCramer said that while moving from hardware to software would be a good strategy for Roku, if it had to sell its players at a loss to do so, it would make it even harder to turn a profit.\n\n\"So there are a lot of question marks about the company. But as for Roku the stock, well, let me just say I don't want you to buy it up here,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"If you got in on the amazing Roku IPO, good for you. You made a fortune. But when you dig deeper into the story, it's clear that there are a lot of things that could trip up investors. I don't want you to get burned. I say take a pass up here. Maybe Roku can transform into a profitable business, but I don't recommend betting money on it. And if you got some on the deal, congratulate yourself.

Ireland disagreed with the proposal and said many Nordic countries had joined it in opposition.\n\nThe issue came to a head last year when the EU ordered Ireland to collect a record 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in taxes from Apple Inc., arguing that it had profited from a system allowing it to escape almost all taxes the EU felt were due.\n\n\"Today the market is dysfunctional. It is not normal that companies make excessive profits and pay nothing in taxes,\" Macron said, painting a situation where the giants of industry were able to profit in Europe and small startups suffered because of it.\n\nThe plan for a tax system that should hit U.S. tech companies harder will be coming up at EU ministerial meetings later this fall and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was convinced a deal would emerge.\n\nThe view is that digital multinationals can play member states against each other to get the best tax deal, leaving them with huge profits and extremely low taxes.\n\n\"We are in a tough situation because of the competition between European nations on this. It is a schizophrenic situation and not common sense,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.\n\n\"Within a short timeframe, it profits them, but it is a short-term vision. If we need a future strategy, we need to look at more harmonization,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland, which is contesting the Apple decision in court, said more taxes were not the answer for the digital challenges facing the continent.\n\n\"If you want Europe to become a digital leader, the solution is not more taxes and more regulation. It is actually the opposite,\" Varadkar said.\n\n\"People bemoan the fact that there is no European Google, no European Facebook, that there is no European LinkedIn,\" Varadkar said. \"If you want those things in Europe and you want those type of companies to come to generate in Europe, it is not through heavy taxes and high regulation.\"", "Hardware companies face tough transition to become more software-focused\n\nWall Street's huge welcome for Roku Inc.'s initial public offering is reminiscent of its embrace of the once-hot IPOs of GoPro and Fitbit, and investors would be wise to step back and look at both of those companies are now faring.\n\nRoku's ROKU, +12.94% valuation has doubled since its IPO on Thursday.

Both of these companies make a specific hardware product with low profit-margins, but have grand schemes to expand beyond their hardware horizons.\n\nIn GoPro's case, the developer of sports cameras spent millions of dollars creating an entertainment business. Its move into content was to be based on the extreme sports videos shot from GoPro's cameras by its customers, including professional athletes and celebrities. But last year, GoPro closed it down, leading to layoffs and restructuring charges. Nowadays, GoPro, which came to market at $24 a share, trades around $11.04, a plunge of about 70%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.11% is up 32% over the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitbit earlier this year announced a big move into software, as it tries to create an ecosystem, a la Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.55% At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Fitbit unveiled a social feed for Fitbit users, telling MarketWatch in an interview that users of its wearable fitness trackers were inspired by social motivation.\n\nThis summer, Fitbit announced the Fitbit Ionic, a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch and to compensate for the flagging sales of its older devices. The Fitbit smartwatch will also rely upon an ecosystem of software apps, but it was criticized at launch for, among other issues, the small number of apps available. Shares of Fitbit have tumbled about 78% from its IPO, while the Dow is up about 25% over the same period.\n\nRead: Fitbit and GoPro woes show hardware is still a risky investment\n\nRoku appears to be following a similar path to TiVo Corp.

Last year, it merged with Rovi in a $1.1 billion deal , and is clearly de-emphasizing the hardware aspect of its business. TiVo executives told investors at a meeting in May that it is \"hardware agnostic\" and it is sees itself as a software solution.\n\nRoku said in its regulatory filings that sales of its Roku player slipped 2% to $117.3 million in the first six months of 2017, and that it's lowering average selling prices for its hardware. But its platform revenue soared 91% to $43.1 million for the same period, with a much lower cost of sales, and a higher profit.\n\nBecoming more of a software-based company will not be an easy task for Roku, as evidenced by the setbacks at GoPro, Fitbit and TiVo. Roku believes it has it all figured out, and indeed it has a good start. But investors need to remember that not every company can shift from a hardware focus without any pain.", "Apple has issued its first public response to growing pressure by the FCC and other groups to activate FM terrestrial radio features inside iPhones for end-users. In a statement, the company said it cares deeply about the safety of its users and directed users towards its emergency calling and Medical ID features.\n\nIt is not possible. iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals\n\n-- Philip Schiller (@pschiller) September 28, 2017\n\nIt also revealed that is technically impossible for iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 to serve as an FM radio anyway, as they lack chips and antennas to support the signal.\n\nAlthough the statement doesn't say it directly, it is pretty obvious that Apple is not interested in developing or supporting FM radio features for its devices.\n\nIn fact, it is taking the argument off the table by designing its newer phones in such a way that it could not add an FM radio even if it wanted to.\n\nApple does not address the technical feasibility of adding a FM radio to older devices, like the iPhone 6s which it still sells at the Apple Store. Of course, whilst it is believed to be possible on older phones, Apple has shown no interest in enabling terrestrial radio features.\n\nThe FCC referred to FM's ability to broadcast information in light of the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes. Apple pointed to the presence of government emergency notifications on iOS, which serve as a reasonable alternative source for the same information. This includes weather warnings and AMBER alerts.\n\nUsers can check to see if they have these critical alerts enabled by going to Settings \u2192 Notifications on their iPhone and scrolling to the bottom of the list to find the 'Government Alerts' section. Just flick the switches to green to receive these alerts on your lock screen as they come in.\n\nUsers interested in listening to the radio can use the Radio section in Apple Music or the new Radio app in watchOS 4.1.

About the size of a tic tac box, it will measure their every move.\n\nThe device can compute 1000 data points a second, and measures things like how far a player has run, how many sprints the player has made and the intensity of collisions.\n\nKnown as the S5, this device will be worn by all players in the AFL grand final, as it has throughout the season. It will be used by coaches and broadcasters to track player performance.\n\nBoth teams participating the NRL grand final, the North Queensland Cowboys and the Melbourne Storm, use a version of it too.\n\nYet the S5's significance goes beyond this weekend's big games: it has underpinned one of the more interesting stories in Australian business for a while now. And the company behind it, Catapult Group, offers a glimpse at what the future of commerce in this country could look like.\n\nCatapult Group listed on the ASX in 2014. It is currently valued at about $200 million, and employs over 300 people. It has come along way in a relatively short time, but has even bigger ambitions. It has publicly stated a goal to eventually become a multibillion-dollar tech giant.\n\n\"We are a high-growth company,\" chief executive Joe Powell tells Fairfax Media.\n\n\"If we execute our strategy, we believe that we will continue to grow, and that will result in a significantly higher market capitalisation than what we have today.\"\n\nTo realise that goal, Catapult will need to make a risky leap from being a provider of technology to elite athletes to selling things to mere mortals in the mass market.\n\nIt will also need to restore faith with investors badly burned by some of its recent decisions.\n\nAdelaide Crows star Eddie Betts will have his every move measured.\n\nAnd it will need to convince them that its plan to pursue growth before short-term profit (a strategy Australian investors are often uncomfortable with) is the right one.\n\nThe new economy\n\nIf you wanted to draw up a vision for what for an Australian company designed for the new global economy might look like, it would probably resemble Catapult, or at least share some of its traits.\n\nSpawned out of two government agencies, it's a relatively rare example of a business successfully commercialising the world-class research this country is known to churn out. CSL is another.\n\nCrucially, it's also a lifestyle business that harnesses some of Australia's defining attributes - our obsession with fitness, and our relatively high levels of participation in sport.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is an export success story. Some of the world's best known athletes are users, and some of the world's best known sporting teams are paying customers.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys use Catapult's technology. Photo: AP\n\nAcross the Pacific in the US, NFL teams such as the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons are also clients. So too are European soccer giants like Chelsea FC and Borussia Dortmund. All up it has 1500 elite teams on its books.\n\nCatapult Group's flagship product is the S5. Canaccord Genuity analyst Owen Humphries estimates they cost about $195 per month under the company's subscription model, and are used by about 900 teams to measure performance and reduce the risk of injuries.\n\nThe company has cheaper tracking devices, and has also developed an indoor tracking system that has been installed in 16 stadiums around the world, including the Etihad in Melbourne.\n\nThrough recent acquisitions it is expanding into video analytics for teams, and selling data to media companies. Look out for a player tracker sponsored by Telstra during the AFL grand final. (It powered a similar feature during this year's State of Origin series.)\n\nBut Catapult's imminent push into cheaper devices for more mainstream consumers could be its riskiest and most ambitious move yet.\n\nA brief history\n\nCatapult was founded in 2006 by Shaun Holthouse and Igor van de Griendt, two engineers who had worked on a federal government research grant program with the Australian Institute of Sport on early micro-technologies.\n\nCatapult Sports exec chairman Adir Shiffman (left) and founder Shaun Holthouse. Photo: Josh Robenstone\n\nBarely a year in they'd signed up their first AFL team (Hawthorn). In 2011, they opened a US office, and had signed up their first NFL team (the Jacksonville Jaguars) and their first US top division college football team.\n\nBy 2013 they were supplying most of Australia's sports teams and many offshore teams with GPS tracking devices. But growth was slowing. So Adir Shiffman, a qualified medical doctor and serial tech start-up founder, was installed as executive chairman.\n\nShiffman swiftly set about trying to raise funds to launch a deeper assault on the lucrative and much bigger US market. Yet, even though this was only a few years ago, the climate for fundraising by small tech firms with scant revenue, let alone profit, was vastly different.\n\n\"We tried to raise $10 million. Forget about that,\" recounts Shiffman.\n\n\"No one would give us a cent. We took the whole of 2013, couldn't raise any money. I'm friends with all of the VC people. They all passed. You name them.\"\n\nThe funding freeze for early-stage tech companies in Australia has thawed since then. But the reasons Catapult failed to secure backing remain telling.\n\n\"It was the times, it was a businesss people didn't really understand, it was a market size Australian investors couldn't really get their heads around,\" says Shiffman.\n\nIn early 2014 the company managed to scrounge together $3.5 million from family and friends.\n\nSoon after, Shiffman's relentless networking and overtures in America paid off. Mark Cuban, the billionaire internet entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks (who'd been using Catapult's technology), came on board as an adviser and investor. \"That transformed our credibility in the US,\" says Shiffman.\n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's investment in Catapult was a game changer. Photo: Evan Vucci\n\nWith Cuban's support, Catapult gathered momentum in the world's biggest economy. By the end of 2014, 14 NFL teams, 10 NBA teams and the reigning college football champions (Florida State) were customers.\n\nThat gave the company confidence to proceed with an IPO on the ASX. The float was a success, but to say that it has been a tumultuous ride since then would be an understatement.\n\nLess than a year into the company's listed existence, the AFL awarded a contract for GPS tracking and player data to Champion Data, a company the league holds a 49 per cent interest in.\n\nThe damage to Catapult was relatively shortlived - individual AFL teams revolted, and an agreement was struck for them to be able to remain customers.\n\nThe share price subsequently recovered, and went on a tear. In mid 2016 it hit a peak at $4, valuing the business at more than $500 million.\n\nSince then the descent has been steady.\n\nIn July last year, the company raised $100 million in fresh capital to shore up its balance sheet and fund two acquisitions designed to diversify its business. These were XOS, a Boston-based video analytics provider for many sports teams, and PlayerTek, an Irish firm that makes cheaper GPS tracking devices designed for amateur, but still serious, athletes.\n\nThis year, it has posted a loss of $13.5 million, launched another equity raising, and pledged to invest for growth.\n\nThese moves caught the market off guard, and investors hit the stock price.\n\nAll up it has fallen 70 per cent since its mid 2016 peak. And anyone who tipped money into either of the last two capital raisings is deep underwater.\n\nThe problem with wearables\n\nLayered above these challenges is another significant problem: wearable device makers have been a graveyard for investors. That could pose issues for Catapult as it attempts to become a more consumer-facing company.\n\nFitbit has struggled since its float. Photo: Supplied\n\nFitbit, one of the early market leaders in wearables, made it on to the US sharemarket through an IPO in 2015 but has struggled since then. Revenue has been shrinking, losses have deepened, and the share price has sunk.\n\nJawbone, a heavily hyped maker of wearable fitness-tracking bracelets, has all but gone out of business. The company, which raised nearly $US600 million from venture capital investors, and which was at one point valued at $US3.3 billion, started liquidating assets in July.\n\nThe reason why no one seems to be able to make the wearable device business work? In a word - Apple.\n\nPeople seem either content to use their phone for the types of things cheaper fitness trackers can do, or if they are prepared to spend a bit more money, they buy an Apple Watch.\n\nApple unveiled a new model watch and is pushing hard into wearable tech. Photo: Timothy Fadek\n\n???\"The wearables sector is being dominated globally by Apple,\" says Foad Fadaghi, managing director of tech analysis firm Telsyte. Repeat purchases of devices made by the likes of Jawbone and Fitbit are extremely low, he says.\n\n\"One reason we believe is that many were given as unwanted gifts. There is also design concerns and lack of features and integration.\"\n\nThese are not problems Catapult faces with its elite products. They have features aplenty, and are not being abandoned by customers.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of the company's products are now sold on a subscription basis to elite teams. The \"churn rate\" (the proportion of users who quit after their contract expires) is less than 2 per cent, a level described by Canaccord's Humphries as \"exceptionally low\".\n\nCatapult also has a strategy more considered than those of other wearables companies. ???For its consumer expansion, which is scheduled to ramp up in 2018, it is targeting sub-elite or \"prosumer\" athletes: people who take their sport pretty seriously but aren't paid professionals.\n\nCatapult is targeting high-level amateurs in competitions such as the VFL. Photo: Chris Hopkins\n\nIn an Australian context, this basically means the highest levels of amateur sport in each code (think VFL, or club rugby in Sydney).\n\nIn the US, it would mean smaller college teams, and high school teams, of which there are many. The company estimates there are 440,000 high school athletes in the US playing soccer seriously, and over 1 million high school athletes playing American football, who could be drawn to its prosumer offerings.\n\n\"We think it's an attractive market to go after,\" says Powell.\n\nPreviously a senior executive at Seek who joined as chief executive in April, Powell says Catapult's links to pro teams give it advantages over rival wearables makers.\n\n\"If you look at some of the offerings in the market, they don't have that authentic connection to elite teams,\" he says.\n\nHe likens the company's intended offerings to Garmin's Edge cycling products which have been successful with serious, but not professional, cyclists.\n\nIn the US, a fierce debate is raging about the safety of American football, amid evidence concussions prevalent in the sport lead to lasting brain damage. Participation in the most popular sport in the US at youth levels has been falling. More broadly, there are concerns kids are turning away from sport to play video games.\n\nDebate is raging in America about the effects of concussion. Photo: AP\n\nBut Powell is not concerned.\n\n\"Fundamentally these sports are ingrained in these countries,\" he says. \"And there is a whole generation of kids coming through who want to know how they are going, to compare themselves to other teams and kids and track their progresss.\"\n\nThe way forward\n\nThe analyst community remains upbeat about Catapult's prospects, despite its recent share price slump.\n\nCanaccord's Humphries says \"prosumer\" is a huge opportunity for Catapult that could \"add another layer of growth to the business\".\n\nHe estimates it's a market 10 to 20 times the size of the elite sports market, with the potential for as many as 2 million devices to be sold. (For comparison, Catapult currently has fewer than 14,000 units under subscription.)\n\n\"Catapult competes in a large and fast growing sports analytics industry with significant barriers to entry and a technological advantage over its competitors, in our view, that is likely to drive revenue growth over the medium term,\" he wrote in a research note.\n\nIvor Ries, an analyst at Morgans, claims Catapult is \"back on track\" after a year of disruption caused by heavy investment and acquisitions.\n\n\"The company is a world leader in elite athletics devices and analytics and continues to invest aggressively in growing its global user base,\" he recently told clients. \"The market opportunity ahead of Catapult remains large and the company has shown a strong ability to execute.\"\n\nFor his part, Shiffman is philosophical about the share price volatility.\n\n\"It's so weird, there is no way a company that was worth $10 million at the start of 2014 was worth $60 at the end [of 2014], and worth $500 million a year and a half later. It just shows the inefficiency of markets' ability to price the value of an asset,\" he says.\n\nShiffman points out there is still room for the company to grow its elite offering. Only about 10 per cent of the world's elite teams are using GPS tracking systems. Yet prosumer could be an even bigger opportunity.\n\n\"This is an offering whose time has come,\" says Shiffman of the company's prosumer push. \"And Catapult is positioned in ways that no other company in the world is to make this [work].\"\n\nIt won't be on the minds of Dustin Martin, Eddie Betts or anyone tuning into this weekend's grand finals. But Australians should keep an eye on Catapult's progress.\n\nAt a time when anxiety over our post-mining boom, post-property boom future is building, its story suggests we can still produce innovative products. The question is whether we can still produce great, sustainable companies.\n\nThe story The Aussie tech powering our sports superstars first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "GPS devices attached to sports stars playing in grand finals this weekend could be in for a bumpy ride, as could the future of Catapult Group, the company that makes them.\n\nWhen Dustin Martin and Eddie Betts stride on to the MCG on Saturday afternoon, the football stars will have more than decades of expectation from fans on their shoulders.\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nIn a small pouch between the shoulder blades of their guernseys a GPS tracking device will be placed.

Photo: Josh Robenstone\n\nBarely a year in they'd signed up their first AFL team (Hawthorn). In 2011, they opened a US office, and had signed up their first NFL team (the Jacksonville Jaguars) and their first US top division college football team.\n\nBy 2013 they were supplying most of Australia's sports teams and many offshore teams with GPS tracking devices. But growth was slowing. So Adir Shiffman, a qualified medical doctor and serial tech start-up founder, was installed as executive chairman.\n\nShiffman swiftly set about trying to raise funds to launch a deeper assault on the lucrative and much bigger US market. Yet, even though this was only a few years ago, the climate for fundraising by small tech firms with scant revenue, let alone profit, was vastly different.\n\n\"We tried to raise $10 million. Forget about that,\" recounts Shiffman.\n\n\"No one would give us a cent. We took the whole of 2013, couldn't raise any money. I'm friends with all of the VC people. They all passed. You name them.\"\n\nThe funding freeze for early-stage tech companies in Australia has thawed since then. But the reasons Catapult failed to secure backing remain telling.\n\n\"It was the times, it was a businesss people didn't really understand, it was a market size Australian investors couldn't really get their heads around,\" says Shiffman.\n\nIn early 2014 the company managed to scrounge together $3.5 million from family and friends.\n\nSoon after, Shiffman's relentless networking and overtures in America paid off. Mark Cuban, the billionaire internet entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks (who'd been using Catapult's technology), came on board as an adviser and investor. \"That transformed our credibility in the US,\" says Shiffman.\n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban's investment in Catapult was a game changer. Photo: Evan Vucci\n\nWith Cuban's support, Catapult gathered momentum in the world's biggest economy. By the end of 2014, 14 NFL teams, 10 NBA teams and the reigning college football champions (Florida State) were customers.\n\nThat gave the company confidence to proceed with an IPO on the ASX. The float was a success, but to say that it has been a tumultuous ride since then would be an understatement.\n\nLess than a year into the company's listed existence, the AFL awarded a contract for GPS tracking and player data to Champion Data, a company the league holds a 49 per cent interest in.\n\nThe damage to Catapult was relatively shortlived - individual AFL teams revolted, and an agreement was struck for them to be able to remain customers.\n\nThe share price subsequently recovered, and went on a tear. In mid 2016 it hit a peak at $4, valuing the business at more than $500 million.\n\nSince then the descent has been steady.\n\nIn July last year, the company raised $100 million in fresh capital to shore up its balance sheet and fund two acquisitions designed to diversify its business. These were XOS, a Boston-based video analytics provider for many sports teams, and PlayerTek, an Irish firm that makes cheaper GPS tracking devices designed for amateur, but still serious, athletes.\n\nThis year, it has posted a loss of $13.5 million, launched another equity raising, and pledged to invest for growth.\n\nThese moves caught the market off guard, and investors hit the stock price.\n\nAll up it has fallen 70 per cent since its mid 2016 peak. And anyone who tipped money into either of the last two capital raisings is deep underwater.\n\nThe problem with wearables\n\nLayered above these challenges is another significant problem: wearable device makers have been a graveyard for investors. That could pose issues for Catapult as it attempts to become a more consumer-facing company.\n\nFitbit has struggled since its float. Photo: Supplied\n\nFitbit, one of the early market leaders in wearables, made it on to the US sharemarket through an IPO in 2015 but has struggled since then. Revenue has been shrinking, losses have deepened, and the share price has sunk.\n\nJawbone, a heavily hyped maker of wearable fitness-tracking bracelets, has all but gone out of business. The company, which raised nearly $US600 million from venture capital investors, and which was at one point valued at $US3.3 billion, started liquidating assets in July.\n\nThe reason why no one seems to be able to make the wearable device business work? In a word - Apple.\n\nPeople seem either content to use their phone for the types of things cheaper fitness trackers can do, or if they are prepared to spend a bit more money, they buy an Apple Watch.\n\nApple unveiled a new model watch and is pushing hard into wearable tech. Photo: Timothy Fadek\n\n???\"The wearables sector is being dominated globally by Apple,\" says Foad Fadaghi, managing director of tech analysis firm Telsyte. Repeat purchases of devices made by the likes of Jawbone and Fitbit are extremely low, he says.\n\n\"One reason we believe is that many were given as unwanted gifts. There is also design concerns and lack of features and integration.\"\n\nThese are not problems Catapult faces with its elite products. They have features aplenty, and are not being abandoned by customers.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of the company's products are now sold on a subscription basis to elite teams. The \"churn rate\" (the proportion of users who quit after their contract expires) is less than 2 per cent, a level described by Canaccord's Humphries as \"exceptionally low\".\n\nCatapult also has a strategy more considered than those of other wearables companies. ???For its consumer expansion, which is scheduled to ramp up in 2018, it is targeting sub-elite or \"prosumer\" athletes: people who take their sport pretty seriously but aren't paid professionals.\n\nCatapult is targeting high-level amateurs in competitions such as the VFL. Photo: Chris Hopkins\n\nIn an Australian context, this basically means the highest levels of amateur sport in each code (think VFL, or club rugby in Sydney).\n\nIn the US, it would mean smaller college teams, and high school teams, of which there are many. The company estimates there are 440,000 high school athletes in the US playing soccer seriously, and over 1 million high school athletes playing American football, who could be drawn to its prosumer offerings.\n\n\"We think it's an attractive market to go after,\" says Powell.\n\nPreviously a senior executive at Seek who joined as chief executive in April, Powell says Catapult's links to pro teams give it advantages over rival wearables makers.\n\n\"If you look at some of the offerings in the market, they don't have that authentic connection to elite teams,\" he says.\n\nHe likens the company's intended offerings to Garmin's Edge cycling products which have been successful with serious, but not professional, cyclists.\n\nIn the US, a fierce debate is raging about the safety of American football, amid evidence concussions prevalent in the sport lead to lasting brain damage. Participation in the most popular sport in the US at youth levels has been falling. More broadly, there are concerns kids are turning away from sport to play video games.\n\nDebate is raging in America about the effects of concussion. Photo: AP\n\nBut Powell is not concerned.\n\n\"Fundamentally these sports are ingrained in these countries,\" he says. \"And there is a whole generation of kids coming through who want to know how they are going, to compare themselves to other teams and kids and track their progresss.\"\n\nThe way forward\n\nThe analyst community remains upbeat about Catapult's prospects, despite its recent share price slump.\n\nCanaccord's Humphries says \"prosumer\" is a huge opportunity for Catapult that could \"add another layer of growth to the business\".\n\nHe estimates it's a market 10 to 20 times the size of the elite sports market, with the potential for as many as 2 million devices to be sold. (For comparison, Catapult currently has fewer than 14,000 units under subscription.)\n\n\"Catapult competes in a large and fast growing sports analytics industry with significant barriers to entry and a technological advantage over its competitors, in our view, that is likely to drive revenue growth over the medium term,\" he wrote in a research note.\n\nIvor Ries, an analyst at Morgans, claims Catapult is \"back on track\" after a year of disruption caused by heavy investment and acquisitions.\n\n\"The company is a world leader in elite athletics devices and analytics and continues to invest aggressively in growing its global user base,\" he recently told clients. \"The market opportunity ahead of Catapult remains large and the company has shown a strong ability to execute.\"\n\nFor his part, Shiffman is philosophical about the share price volatility.\n\n\"It's so weird, there is no way a company that was worth $10 million at the start of 2014 was worth $60 at the end [of 2014], and worth $500 million a year and a half later. It just shows the inefficiency of markets' ability to price the value of an asset,\" he says.\n\nShiffman points out there is still room for the company to grow its elite offering. Only about 10 per cent of the world's elite teams are using GPS tracking systems. Yet prosumer could be an even bigger opportunity.\n\n\"This is an offering whose time has come,\" says Shiffman of the company's prosumer push. \"And Catapult is positioned in ways that no other company in the world is to make this [work].\"\n\nIt won't be on the minds of Dustin Martin, Eddie Betts or anyone tuning into this weekend's grand finals. But Australians should keep an eye on Catapult's progress.\n\nAt a time when anxiety over our post-mining boom, post-property boom future is building, its story suggests we can still produce innovative products. The question is whether we can still produce great, sustainable companies.\n\nThe story The Aussie tech powering our sports superstars first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "GPS devices attached to sports stars playing in grand finals this weekend could be in for a bumpy ride, as could the future of Catapult Group, the company that makes them.\n\nWhen Dustin Martin and Eddie Betts stride on to the MCG on Saturday afternoon, the football stars will have more than decades of expectation from fans on their shoulders.\n\nView More Local BusinessList Your Business Here\n\nIn a small pouch between the shoulder blades of their guernseys a GPS tracking device will be placed. About the size of a tic tac box, it will measure their every move.\n\nThe device can compute 1000 data points a second, and measures things like how far a player has run, how many sprints the player has made and the intensity of collisions.\n\nKnown as the S5, this device will be worn by all players in the AFL grand final, as it has throughout the season. It will be used by coaches and broadcasters to track player performance.\n\nBoth teams participating the NRL grand final, the North Queensland Cowboys and the Melbourne Storm, use a version of it too.\n\nYet the S5's significance goes beyond this weekend's big games: it has underpinned one of the more interesting stories in Australian business for a while now. And the company behind it, Catapult Group, offers a glimpse at what the future of commerce in this country could look like.\n\nCatapult Group listed on the ASX in 2014. It is currently valued at about $200 million, and employs over 300 people. It has come along way in a relatively short time, but has even bigger ambitions. It has publicly stated a goal to eventually become a multibillion-dollar tech giant.\n\n\"We are a high-growth company,\" chief executive Joe Powell tells Fairfax Media.\n\n\"If we execute our strategy, we believe that we will continue to grow, and that will result in a significantly higher market capitalisation than what we have today.\"\n\nTo realise that goal, Catapult will need to make a risky leap from being a provider of technology to elite athletes to selling things to mere mortals in the mass market.\n\nIt will also need to restore faith with investors badly burned by some of its recent decisions.\n\nAdelaide Crows star Eddie Betts will have his every move measured.\n\nAnd it will need to convince them that its plan to pursue growth before short-term profit (a strategy Australian investors are often uncomfortable with) is the right one.\n\nThe new economy\n\nIf you wanted to draw up a vision for what for an Australian company designed for the new global economy might look like, it would probably resemble Catapult, or at least share some of its traits.\n\nSpawned out of two government agencies, it's a relatively rare example of a business successfully commercialising the world-class research this country is known to churn out. CSL is another.\n\nCrucially, it's also a lifestyle business that harnesses some of Australia's defining attributes - our obsession with fitness, and our relatively high levels of participation in sport.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, it is an export success story. Some of the world's best known athletes are users, and some of the world's best known sporting teams are paying customers.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys use Catapult's technology. Photo: AP\n\nAcross the Pacific in the US, NFL teams such as the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers and the Atlanta Falcons are also clients. So too are European soccer giants like Chelsea FC and Borussia Dortmund. All up it has 1500 elite teams on its books.\n\nCatapult Group's flagship product is the S5. Canaccord Genuity analyst Owen Humphries estimates they cost about $195 per month under the company's subscription model, and are used by about 900 teams to measure performance and reduce the risk of injuries.\n\nThe company has cheaper tracking devices, and has also developed an indoor tracking system that has been installed in 16 stadiums around the world, including the Etihad in Melbourne.\n\nThrough recent acquisitions it is expanding into video analytics for teams, and selling data to media companies. Look out for a player tracker sponsored by Telstra during the AFL grand final.

Samsung committed to the same specification for its flagship Galaxy smartphones; in all, about 90 smartphone models use Qi today, making it the industry's most popular among three standards. In addition to desktop charging stations (typically in the form of small charging pads), the automotive marketplace has also adopted in-cabin wireless charging.\n\nNearly 80 car models, from Audi, Chevrolet and KIA to Hyundai, Nissan and BMW, offer in-cabin wireless charging based on the electromagnetic Qi charging specification.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 public Qi charging locations worldwide, according to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the entity in charge of the Qi standard.\n\nMajor brands like McDonald's, Marriott, Ibis and others have built Qi into their properties. Airports, such as London Heathrow, Philadelphia and others around the world, have Qi charging stations. And businesses like Facebook, Google, Deloitte, PwC and Cisco have built Qi into their corporate offices.\n\n\"Over the last few years, one of the major delays for [manufacturers] wanting to introduce wireless charging solutions, particularly in the automotive in-cabin market, is the wait to discover which standard Apple may choose for any wireless-charging-enabled iPhone,\" said Vicky Yussuff, IHS lead analyst for wireless power. \"Now that Apple has decided to use the Qi standard, transmitter shipments into the in-cabin market will likely surge.\"\n\nAlong with third-party wireless charging manufacturers, Apple also plans to release its own AirPower wireless charging station designed to charge up to three Apple products at once, including the iPhone devices, Apple Watch and Apple AirPods through the charging case.\n\nThe number of devices enabled with wireless charging exceeded 200 million units a year for the first time in 2016, according to the latest IHS Markit forecast. Driven by shipments in mobile phones and wearables, that represented a 40% increase over 2015 levels as more consumers experience wireless charging for the first time.\n\nThe 2016 IHS Markit consumer survey showed that one in four people has now used wireless charging, and more than 98% of those would choose the feature again on their next phone. Both consumer demand for the feature and the volume of enabled devices are growing each year.\n\n\"Samsung's success with implementing wireless charging over the last two years coupled with Apple's iPhone announcement this week demonstrates that wireless charging technology is clearly achieving mainstream adoption in the mobile phone market, and the scope of its application is expected to quickly follow suit in other applications,\" Yussuff stated in a recent industry report.\n\nFor several years, restaurants, coffee shops and airports have been piloting the use of wireless charging for customer convenience.\n\nWith wireless charging adoption becoming widespread, the impulse for many users will be to just plop their smartphones down on the charging pad where it will remain fully charged all day long.\n\nIs it bad to fully charge your smartphone?\n\nWith greater ease of charging via wireless technology, the question becomes: Is it bad for your mobile device battery to be fully charged all the time?\n\nVenkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS), said that while you cannot overcharge a smartphone or tablet battery, as the electronics will not allow it, keeping it fully charged will hasten its degradation.\n\n\"Frankly, the higher you are in the [charge] state, as you creep up to 90%, 95% to 100% charge, the more degradation the battery will see,\" he said.\n\nAs a lithium-ion battery charges and discharges, ions pass back and forth between a positive electrode (made of lithium-cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate) and a negative electrode (made of carbon graphite).\n\nAs a battery charges, the positive electrode gives off lithium ions that move to the negative electrode and are stored as energy. As the battery discharges, those ions move back to the positive electrode to be used as electricity. As those lithium ions move back and forth, the electrolyte that acts as the transport medium degrades over time.\n\nThe higher the state of charge, the faster the electrolyte degrades, Srinivasan said.\n\nTherefore, it's best not only to keep your smartphone below its top charge, but also to keep the charging and discharging pendulum from swinging wildly.\n\n\"In general, if you swing the battery charge from top to bottom, that's the worst thing you can to for the life of the battery. If you can cycle the battery between 45% and 55% that's the best thing you can do,\" Srinivasan said. \"But, in general, just make sure you don't keep it fully charged.\"\n\nSrinivasan also cautions against being too sensitive to your smartphone or tablet charging. Most smartphone manufacturers design batteries to last two to three years, so if you're a consumer who typically replaces your phone after that amount of time, you don't need to be overly concerned with charging rates.\n\nAs more lithium-ion batteries hit the market, in both consumer electronics and electric vehicles, the rhetoric over whether you should keep those batteries fully charged has heated up, Srinivasan said. His blog posts often receive long comment threads from both sides of the spectrum.\n\n\"The debate between degradation due to high voltage hold vs. degradation due to over-cycling/over-discharge is a hot one,\" Daniel Steingart, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, stated in a recent blog post.\n\nLeaving your smartphone or tablet fully charged will speed the degradation of the battery, he said. But, he added, it's not that simple.\n\nThe damage of fully charging your battery has lessened over time with more sophisticated mobile battery management systems and incremental improvements in the battery cell technology itself, he said. For example, in 2007, when Steingart was a graduate student, taking a battery cell repeatedly to 4.2 volts meant \"an early death\" for it. he said. Today, the same damage to modern battery cells would require at least 4.4 volts.\n\nEven though battery cell technology has improved, there are still too many industry variables to know definitively whether one battery will show greater endurance than another based on continuous charging.\n\n\"We simply don't know, without a complicated tear-down and reverse engineering of the battery and battery management system, what the actual state of charge when the phone says '100%' is,\" Steingart said. \"Some apps give voltage indication, yes, but without knowing the specific formulation and composition of the cathode, we don't know exactly.\"\n\nBMS systems stop a smartphone or tablet from continually charging through the use of a sophisticated algorithm that balances how long the phone will last today vs. how long the battery will last, according to Steingart. If not for BMS technology, constantly charging your phone would kill the battery after a few months, he said.\n\nSteingart argued that the convenience of having a fully charged phone outweighs the risk of long-term battery damage. \"It's generally pretty straightforward to change a battery in a phone or have someone do it for you for [about] $20,\" he said. \"An extra $20 for a few years of convenience? Sign me up.\"\n\nApple charges a bit more for a battery replacement; regardless of the model you own, it's $79. If you have an AppleCare extended warranty, then it's free.\n\n\"Yes, a cell phone is an investment,\" Steingart said, \"but relative to the incremental cost of a new battery, there are much, much more important things to worry about in the world.\"", "The Italian supercar maker is still young at heart, even though it just turned 70 years old, throwing a huge birthday party for itself on October 7 - October 8 in the Big Apple.\n\nThe New York City bash has all the premises to be epic - maybe they'll do a movie afterwards Hangover style - with the event, titled \"Driven By Emotion: Ferrari Through The Decades,\" acting as the completion of the worldwide celebratory events that lasted more than a year and visited almost 60 countries.

These were smaller updates that came after the more flashy Lion and Leopard versions of OS X. Each bought a handful of new features but mostly focused on under-the-hood changes, rather than improving the apps we use day-to-day.\n\nWhere Show Leopard rewrote the Finder in Cocoa, brought Grand Central Dispatch, and improved power management, Mountain Lion bought Gatekeeper and focused on making it easier to manage and synchronise content between multiple Apple devices.\n\nThis time round Apple has completely overhauled the way that the macOS manages and organises your data, as well as adding support for new photo and video codecs that will mean that your increasingly large media files take up less space.\n\nThe sad thing is you probably won't notice this unless you work with large files. But the changes add up to a faster, more secure and more stable operating system. You will just have to take our word for it. (Or you can read the information about AFPS, HEVC and HEIF below.)\n\nLuckily, for those who are bored by such geeky things, there are a few improvements to apps that you will notice, especially the improvements to Photos and the changes in Safari. More on those later.\n\nFirst things first, can you even run macOS High Sierra on your Mac?\n\nThe good news is that if your Mac is running Sierra then it can run the macOS High Sierra. Those machines are:\n\nHowever, some features, like HEVC encoding and decoding, and anything VR related, will require more recent models and processors.\n\nWe are going to endeavour to explain the changes to the file system of macOS in layman's terms. We will try and give a few real-world examples that might make a difference to an average user. This underplays a lot of what's on offer here, but it should give you the general idea.\n\nIn High Sierra Apple has replaced the primary file system of MacOS. Apple File System (APFS) is the successor to the old Hierarchical File System (HFS+), which has been around since the beginning of 1998, so it's pretty ancient.\n\nWe aren't talking about anything you would see in the Finder here. This is the way that your Mac manages and organises all your data.\n\nApple has made changes to HFS+ over the years, but it really needed to go back to the drawing board and start again, and with APFS it has. As a result the Mac file system is set up for the future.\n\nIt's not just the Mac that uses APFS either. iOS 10 rolled APFS out to iPhones and iPads back in 2016, and when users updated their phones to the new OS they were pleased to see that they had recovered a few GB of space.\n\nWe were curious to see whether we'd see increased space following the installation of High Sierra on our Macs, so we took a trip to the Apple menu > About This Mac, and checked the Storage stats before and after the installation.\n\nAs you can see from the results below we did recover some space. When you first look at the storage graph that your Mac generates you may be disappointed, but patience is a virtue and after your Mac has finished its shift to APFS you can expect to be rewarded with some lovely free space.\n\nThat's not the only way that Apple's switch to APFS will benefit you. When it comes to copying large files the process will be faster. We ran our usual file transfer speed test before and after the update to High Sierra. This involved copying a 4GB file. Before we updated the 4GB file copy took 8.41 seconds. Afterwards it was instantaneous. You will never see a Duplicating file window again.\n\nThere is a caveat with this 'copying' though. The file isn't being duplicated at all. It is essentially a writable clone of the original file. Rather than duplicating the original, the cloned file stores the changes that are made to it in the metadata and points to the original for the rest of the data. You could say it's bit like making an alias, except that any changes made to the cloned file will be attached to that version of the clone, rather than reflected in the original. It's also a little like the way Time Machine works - rather than copying every thing on your Mac each time, it just keeps track of the changes.\n\nThe other thing you need to keep in mind here is that if you have filled your Mac up with 100 copies of a what was originally a 4GB file, deleting all of them will not recover 400GB of space.\n\nSpeaking of space, there is another way that you might notice a change curtesy to APFS. If you have multiple partitions on your Mac (perhaps you run lots of virtual machines, or maybe you are just running Sierra and High Sierra consecutively), a new feature of APFS means that the size of the partition will not be limited.\n\nIn other words, previously, if you had given 250GB to your Sierra partition and 250GB to Yosemite, but your Sierra partition had needed more space, you could not grab some GB from Yosemite. Now both of your partitions have access to the same 500GB volume - existing in the same physical space. Both partitions could effectively have 500GB of storage space available - and crucially if you needed more you could add external storage to the volume at a later date.\n\nAnother way that APFS could make a difference to you without you being aware is it's built in crash protection. Even your system ran out of power mid-transfer everything will stay in sync. When your computer starts up again the file you were attempting to transfer won't have been corrupted.\n\nThere are lots of other features coming with APFS that will impact you without you really being aware of them, from built-in encryption, which no longer requires File Vault to work, and Snapshots, which can capture the state of your files at any moment in time. The latter should improve Time Machine as snapshots will take up less storage and copy quicker.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is a Mac that should offer faster, more efficient, and more stable performance. That's as long as you have an SSD (aka Flash storage), which will be automatically converted to APFS by High Siera. At the time of launch APFS, was only available to those with solid-state drives in their Mac. Apple has promised that it will bring APFS to Macs with hard drives and Fusion drives in a future update.\n\nLuckily macOS still supports HFS+, so if you have external drives you won't need to convert them. If you add a new external drives you can choose to update it to APFS though. Of course, if you do so it won't be readable by devices that aren't running High Sierra.\n\nThe other way that Apple is paving the way for the future with MacOS High Sierra is its adoption of two new codecs: HEVC and HEIF.\n\nHEVC stands for high efficiency video codec, and it's another name for H.265, the successor to H.264. The new codec is necessary because video sizes are now so much larger thanks to 4K and HDR. HEVC compresses these extremely high resolution files so they don't take up take up as much space (which is good news if you are shooting lots of video in 4K on your iPhone 8 Plus).\n\nThere is also a new file format for images. The high efficiency image file format (HEIF), like HEVC, makes file sizes even smaller than the ageing Jpeg file format would. Read about HEIF here.\n\nWondering why a new file format for photos is necessary? Our image files are also taking up more and more space. Take a Live Photo taken on the iPhone 8, or a Portrait Mode photo taken on the iPhone 8 Plus, that image file will include depth data in the case of Portrait Mode, and motion elements in the case of a Live Photo. All that information can now be stored as part of the image file itself - which means you can be creative with that data later on.\n\nThe only issue here, at launch in any case, is compatibility. Some apps may not know how to deal with HEIF files yet (e.g. Photoshop!) However, you can export H.264 and JPG versions of your videos and photos so that shouldn't be a big issue - and eventually everyone will catch up, this is an industry standard after all, rather than Apple inventing it's own.\n\nWhile there isn't a lot of content available yet in HEVC, and HEIF is yet to become mainstream, you can expect these standards to become a lot more common in the future. And Apple will be ready for that.\n\nYou will only be able to take advantage of the new formats if you have an iPhone that can create HEVC and HEIF files, that's an iPhone 7 or later, or the latest generation of iPad Pro.\n\nWe still have a few more geeky bits to get through here, but they will have practical applications for you if you enjoy gaming. And even if you aren't a gamer they will still make a difference to your experience of your Mac's interface.\n\nA couple of years ago Apple introduced Metal, a framework that bypassed OpenGL and allowed developers to tap in to the computational power of the graphics processor. Metal 2 is the successor to Metal and it will increase GPU performance and gain support for VR.\n\nThis is great news for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in VR gaming - but note that your Mac may not be able to take advantage of this as it depends on your processor and your GPU (but it will add support for external GPUs in the future).\n\nUnfortunately there isn't a lot of Mac-compatible VR software available, or software written to take advantage of Metal 2 for that matter. However, Apple did announce that Mac users would be able to plug in the HTC Vine running SteamVR (not the Oculus Rift, yet).\n\nThe company is also working with Valve, Unity and Epic, so you can expect to hear even more about VR gaming on the Mac soon.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't really care about VR, you'll be glad to hear that Metal 2 will also mean that your Mac's user interface and any animated effects will look smoother.\n\nNow on to the everyday apps that are bundled in macOS. As has been the case over the past few years, the changes in the macOS apps have tended to reflect functionality that has just become available to the iOS versions of those apps (or in some cases has been available for a generation or so).\n\nThis time round it feels a little like some of the macOS apps - well one macOS app in particular - has gained back some of the functionality it had before it was 'dubbed down' to the level of the iOS equivalent.\n\nWe'll start off by discussing the changes in that app, Photos.\n\nPhotos is the one app in High Sierra that gets the most changes, but for anyone who used to use iPhoto or Aperture, it feels a little like Photo has regained some of the features we used to rely on, and become a more professional app.\n\nThere are some new features that you will recognise from iOS 11, including new ways of editing Live Photos so that you can turn them into gifs and long exposure shots, and the same new filters that you'll see in Photos on the iPhone or iPad. There's also improved facial recognition. We'll take a quick look at each of these below, but you can read more about the changes in Photos here.\n\nThe other big change is that it's a little easier to find your way around the app because the menus are better organised and the Edit mode has been redesigned making it easier to find the tools you want.\n\nWe'll start with the new editing features for Live Photos. You have a few choices here, all of which will make Live Photos something that we will be less inclined to turn off on our phones. It has to be said that Live Photos has been a bit of an annoyance until now, it was often the case that the photo would capture some movement either side of the action, so, for example, the clip would finish with someone putting the phone down. Then you had the annoying audio of someone shouting that would inevitably end up in the background. It often didn't add up to anything to be proud of.\n\nThe changes in Live photos address this as you can finally trim the clips and turn off audio. You can also choose a different still image to represent the clip. But best of all you can turn your clip into something that resembles a gif. In fact there are two types of animation on offer, a Loop and a Bounce, and a Long Exposure effect that you could to capture firework trails or moving water. It's simple and effective.\n\nPhotos also plays better with third party apps, so it's really easy to open a photo directly in Photoshop, use the editing tools from that app, and save your edits to the Photos library. However, there are some new editing tools available in Photos that might make you less likely to open up Photoshop in the first place.\n\nThe new editing tools in Photos include Curves, for adjusting colour and contrast, and Selective Color, so you can swap one hue for another.\n\nThere are also new \"professionally inspired filters\" replacing the nine that were in Sierra. We had high hopes for these, recalling the filters provided in Aperture that mimicked actual photographic styles, but these are basically variations of three different styles: Vivid, Dramatic, and black and white, with warm and cool options. We're a little disappointed to be honest.\n\nOne final thing to mention about Photos is the improved Facial recognition. Apple has claimed to be able to sort your Photo library using facial recognition for generations but it's never really been that good at it. This does appear to have changed in Photos in High Sierra. The difference is that you need to put a little more effort in helping Photos sort out who is who, but it will use machine learning to identify other photos with the same person in them. For example, if you confirm that your son features in one photo from last Tuesday, Photos will look out for him in other photos from last Tuesday.\n\nIt will do a lot of the work in the background, so every now and then you will be asked to confirm if someone is who Photos thinks it is, and in so doing it will enhance its knowledge.\n\nYou might be wondering why you'd even want to spend the time helping Photos sort out who's who. One reasons is the Memories feature, which automatically pulls in photos and videos and creates a montage for you. These can be a bit haphazard we find, but the more Photos knows about your photos the better these montages are. Tell it which photos include your kids and you can expect to see some nice movies.\n\nMemories is able to recognise a few more categories including babies, pets, weddings, birthdays and sports events. The montages are still automatically generated though, rather than being something you can create yourself, which is a shame.\n\nThe other app that gets some attention in High Sierra is Safari. Apple's aim here is to make Safari the fastest web browser and our tests prove that it achieves that.\n\n(Bigger scores are better)\n\nOne way in which Apple is able to speed things up is that it is addressing some of the aspects of the web that slow things down. Sierra 11 will automatically stop auto-playing videos that have sound from running - which is great if you tend to jump out of your skin every time you visit a website that has an autoplaying video blaring out.\n\nIt will also stop cookies from tracking you - which should mean that you don't see ads everywhere relating to the holiday you were thinking of booking. But in practical terms should speed up what goes on in the background when you visit a page and all the trackers associated with each ad start clambering for your information.\n\nSo it's good on both counts - you don't have to listen to auto-playing videos (they will still play if the sound is set to be off), and you don't have to feel that advertisers are stalking you. But most of all the performance will improve. And if a web page is still not performing well then you can choose to use the Reader view.\n\nReader view was introduced a few generations ago but now you can set it on a per-site basis, so if a particular site you use is loaded with ads, you could choose to always see it in Reader view. Remember though that those ads are probably how the people who make the website you are visiting get paid. You can also choose to set your browser to never auto-play video, regardless of whether it has sound.\n\nAll this boils down to an even more power-efficient Safari which Apple promises can deliver an extra two hours of web browsing and four hours of Netflix streaming.\n\nSafari 11 isn't a reason to update to High Sierra in itself though. Safari 11 is also available to those running Sierra 10.12.6 - to get it you need to update your Mac to the latest version of Sierra. Plus, as good as Safari may be, some of the and services you use may not run well in Safari and if that's the case you won't be able to enjoy its new features.\n\nMail gets a couple of tweaks in High Sierra. The main change is the addition of Top Hits, which will give you a couple of suggestions of the most likely email you are searching for based on factors such as how often you engage with the sender. You will find what Mail believes are the two most relevant emails at the top, followed by the rest of your messages in chronological order.\n\nWhen we first started using this feature we kept missing the first two emails - if you know you are looking for an email from last month you don't expect to see it at the top - but we expect we will get used to it.\n\nApple has also improved full screen viewing in Mail. If you work in Full Screen view, when you open an email and then choose to reply the original will take up one half of the screen and the reply, the other half. Previously the reply would have covered the original so this way makes it easier to see what you are replying to. Of course if you don't use Full Screen mode you can easily view two emails at once.\n\nWe've not really sold on the idea of using Siri on our Mac. We're sure that it's a useful feature to be able to ask Siri to turn on Bluetooth, or to play a particular album in iTunes. But frankly we don't use it because the majority of the time, when we think of something to ask Siri we are in a crowded office and don't want to look silly.\n\nThe good news is that in High Sierra, hidden away in the accessibility options, is the opportunity to do just that. System Preferences > Accessibility > Siri and choose Enable Type to Siri. Now if you trigger Siri a keyboard will appear into which you can type your query. Now we just need a way to trigger Siri that doesn't involve clicking on the Siri icon, a Siri button on the keyboard perhaps?\n\nFunny enough that's not the new feature that Apple's pushing for the new version of Siri. Apple is more proud of Siri's natural-sounding voice in High Sierra and iOS 11. The result is a Siri that is slightly less robotic and more colloquial. There's also better music integration so you can treat Siri like a bit of a DJ and ask it to create playlists for you, and it will learn what you like and make recommendations.\n\nSiri and Spotlight now offer flight information and multiple Wikipedia results.\n\nThe rest of the app updates are a little smaller, but still significant, we'll describe them below.\n\nWe use Notes on our iPhone for everything so we were really excited that in macOS High Sierra Notes gained some enhancements.\n\nOne change in Notes has us particularly excited is the fact that we can Pin Notes we need to access frequently to the top. We've lost count how many times we've scrolled through looking for information we have stored in Notes. This is the answer to our prayers!\n\nYou will also be able to create tabled in Notes both on the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Great news, but probably not as ground breaking as the ability to make check lists that came in iOS 9 and El Capitan.\n\nIn iOS 11 Notes gains the ability to scan documents, of course there is no such feature here. What we'd really like to see is a plain text mode - currently if you copy and paste you are stuck with the text style used by the source. It would be nice to have a bit more flexibility over styles and formatting.\n\nIn FaceTime you will be able to capture a Live Photo from a FaceTime call (you can also do this in iOS 11).\n\nWhat would really be useful is FaceTime conference calling, despite the fact that this was possible in iChat many years ago.\n\nAnother small change that's likely to make a huge difference, your Messages will stay in sync across all your devices. So if you have opened your Messages on your phone you won't see them all listed as unread on your laptop when you open it up. If you hate seeing red dots alerting you to unread messages only to find that you had read them, this will probably make your day.\n\nIn High Sierra it will be even easier to share large files with people via iCloud. If you want to share a file that already resides in your iCloud, just select the file, click the Share button, and select Add People. Then select the way you wish to send a link that the recipient can use to access the file, choose from Mail, Messages, AirDrop etc, even Copy Link, and add your contact. When the contact receives the invitation they will be able to access the file on any device (they will need to install iCloud for Windows if they are on a PC). The recipient can then edit the file.\n\nIf you have a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar there are a few tweaks just for you. It's a little less fiddly to control brightness and volume, and there is a new option for enabling Night Shift and AirPlay (added via System Preferences). You'll also find a new colour-picker, a Now Playing button and a shortcut to picture-in-picture.", "The last Friday of September is here, with a couple of items for you to check out. We have a look at the EVGA X299 Micro, which packs a ton of features and performance potential in a micro ATX size for those wanting a small yet powerful build.

It's also a nice preview of what to expect with the iPhone X, since the same A11 is in that one, too.", "touts its closed ecosystem as a security advantage. Because it tightly controls its hardware and software, Apple can push security updates much more quickly than an open system like Android. But researchers at say that Apple's security update system hasn't been working exactly as intended, with thousands of Macs not getting proper updates.\n\nFirmware sits below a 's operating system and runs as the computer is booting up. Security vulnerabilities in firmware are difficult to detect and fix, so it's often a target for sophisticated attacks-Wikileaks' dump, for example, showed that the CIA had developed a firmware exploit for Macs.\n\nApple has worked to improve firmware updates in High Sierra, its latest operating system. In High Sierra, users will get weekly checks to make sure their firmware is up to date and will be invited to send a report to Apple if the check fails.\n\nDuo analyzed more than 73,000 Mac systems to come up with its findings. Of the machines surveyed by Duo, about 4.2 percent weren't running the correct version of the firmware, the researchers claim.\n\n\"Our research has shown there are considerable discrepancies in how Apple provides security support to its EFI firmware as compared to how they support the security of the OS and software,\" Duo researchers wrote in their findings.\n\nHowever, this isn't cause to hurl your MacBook into the ocean. If you're a home user, you're probably not at risk, according to the folks at Duo. Firmware exploits aren't easy to pull off and everyday users aren't likely targets.\n\n\"If you're a home user with a Mac that falls into one of the above categories as their personal computing device, then the sky isn't falling for you, in our opinion. Attacks against EFI have so far been part of the toolkit used by sophisticated adversaries who have specific high value targets in their sights,\" Duo said. \"Most everyday home users fall well outside of this attack model, and thankfully, as far as we are aware, there are not any EFI exploits that are being used as part of commodity exploit kits, malware, or ransomware that has been detected in the wild.\"\n\nHowever, enterprise users should be a bit more concerned. Duo recommends that businesses phase out old Macs that cannot get the latest firmware update or isolate those machines from sensitive networks. And of course, all users should make sure they update to the latest OS so they get the most recent security updates.", "MIKE SMITH Weather Forecasting Is Incredibly Accurate -- but the Public Doesn't Seem to Realize It\n\nThis may seem like a trivial question, but let's consider for a second how our world has come to be the way that it is. How have all the products, services, experiences, and behaviors in our life come to be? Why do we organize society in the way that it is now? Why do we swipe right to accept a date (and now colloquially refer to acceptance of social activity as swiping right), or stress our thumbs by typing on a miniaturized computer keyboard that has been downsized and digitized for our phones? The creators of the products and experiences people use daily hold incredible power to shape the way we engage with the world. A now well-known example is Apple's initial launch of its Health app. While it included daily distance covered and a plethora of other health tracking features, it missed something that has a huge recurring impact on over half the U.S. population: There was no a feature to help women track their periods -- something that has a monthly effect on the physical, social, and emotional state of millions of Americans. How could Apple miss such a market? It's a fairly simple answer: Period tracking simply wasn't a metric that a male design team held top of mind.", "When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 3, one of the hallmark features for the new cellular capabilities was the ability to listen to \"40 million songs on your wrist.\" However, unlike the other new features of the Series 3 which launched in watchOS 4 alongside the new wearable device, Apple only said the Apple Music capabilities were \"coming soon\" without any further information.\n\nThe good news, however, is that much like last year's Portrait Mode feature on the iPhone 7 Plus, it looks like we won't have to wait much longer -- not even a week after the debut of the Apple Watch Series 3, Apple has already pushed out watchOS 4.1 to registered developers, which appears to have the primary purpose of enabling Apple Music support.\n\nUnlike iOS, watchOS 4.1 actually divides the Apple Music capabilities into two separate apps. The existing Music app has been updated to include the content of your iCloud Music Library, while Beats 1 and other Apple Music streaming radio stations are now located in a standalone Radio app.\n\nYour iCloud Music Library appears in watchOS 4.1 simply as part of the content available in the Music app. The layout remains the same as in watchOS 4.0, but simply now includes everything that's available in the cloud, as opposed to only those playlists and albums that have been specifically synced to your wrist. You can browse by playlists, artists, albums, or songs. For the most part items in each list are sorted alphabetically, with the notable exception being the list of albums by artist, which are listed in reverse chronological order.\n\nWhen viewing lists of individual tracks, a cloud icon will appear beside any tracks that are stored in the cloud rather than on the watch itself. Unfortunately, as of this first beta at least, no such designator appears for albums, artists, or playlists; since the watchOS 4 Music app begins playback as soon as you select an album or playlist, with individual track listings hidden behind a button on the Now Playing screen, this means there's no way to identify potentially data-consuming music until you start playback. Further, the main \"Songs\" view doesn't appear to show the cloud icons yet either -- right now they're only appearing on track listings within a playlist or album, as accessed from the button on the Now Playing screen.\n\nAlthough you can still store music locally in the watchOS 4.1 Music app, this still has to be set up from the iPhone Watch app -- there's no way to download music directly to the watch over-the-air. Further, the predefined Apple Music \"For You\" playlists such as New Music Mix, Favorites Mix, and Chill Mix are only available on the watch if they are enabled in the iPhone Watch app.\n\nAs of this first beta, there also appears to be no way to disable the iCloud Music Library from appearing on the Apple Watch, although hopefully this will appear in a later beta for users who want to maintain a smaller wrist-based library.\n\nTo play a song from Apple Music that's not in your iCloud Music Library you'll need to use Siri to call it up in the usual manner. At this point, however, the music will only play on your Apple Watch if your iPhone is not connected, otherwise the song will play on your iPhone instead, much like prior watchOS versions. This of course could change before the final watchOS 4.1 release.\n\nIf you're playing a song from Apple Music that's not in your iCloud Music Library and you want to add it, you'll either need to use Siri (\"add this song to my library\") or switch to the separate Now Playing app to find the + button in the bottom right corner. The love and dislike buttons also appear to have oddly disappeared in watchOS 4 -- we're hoping they make a return before the final release of watchOS 4.1.\n\nApple Music Radio stations have been broken out into a separate \"Radio\" app on the Apple Watch, although the user interface is very similar to that of the Music app. Radio stations appear in a flipping cover view in the same way as albums and playlists in the music app.\n\nA \"Stations\" button at the top allows you to browse the entire set of available stations, with featured stations shown at the top and a list of categories below. Tapping on any station takes you to a standard watchOS Now Playing screen and begins playing music from that station.

As of this first beta, Radio playback is also not supported over cellular, although the release notes suggest that this is a temporary issue.", "Apple says the Federal Communications Commission is getting its signals crossed.\n\nThe tech titan hit back after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai called this week for Apple to activate the FM radio chips in its iPhones to aid customers caught in natural disasters, countering that the chips don't exist in the most recent iPhone models.\n\nBut in a statement to the tech blog MacRumors, Apple said that it was impossible to comply with the FCC chairman's request, because the \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have FM radio chips in them nor do they have antennas designed to support FM signals.\"\n\nPai's request came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which devastated Houston and Puerto Rico as well as large swaths of the Caribbean.\n\nIn its most recent report on the damage done by Hurricane Maria, the FCC noted that only 10 percent of Puerto Rico's mobile towers are up and running. Certain areas of the island are impossible to reach via cellular, though they have radio access.\n\nPai argued that by not giving its customers access to FM radio, Apple was depriving disaster victims of \"vital access to life-saving information\" from local broadcasters when cellular networks are knocked out.\n\n\"It is time for Apple to step up and put the safety of the American people first,\" he said.\n\nBut Apple said late Thursday that Pai is making much ado about nothing. The hardware giant listed a number of other safety solutions it has engineered into its products, including the ability to access emergency services from the lock screen and enabling government emergency notifications.\n\nHowever, Apple's statement failed to explain why older iPhone models -- which still make up over 50 percent of the iPhones currently in use, according to research firm Localytics -- can't access FM radio.\n\nPrevious speculation suggested that Apple has the ability to flip a switch and turn on the FM chip in its phones, but does not do so because it does not want iPhone owners to listen to music for free.\n\nThe FCC declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks have gained for sixth straight quarters to chalk up their best run since 1997, while a 20 percent rebound in oil has turned around one of its worst starts to a year on record.\n\nIt may just be the looming end of the great global easing experiment, but as this graphic shows, investors have spent another quarter piling into risk assets.\n\nEmerging market stocks .MSCIEF have added almost 7 percent. Wall Street .SXP and MSCI's 46-country world share index .WORLD have both risen 4 percent, with the latter on its longest run of gains since late 1997, when 11 rising quarters came to an end.\n\nDebt from some of the world's most politically strained countries has also rallied.\n\nAnalysts ascribe this to a mix of higher global growth, cheap and plentiful central bank liquidity, subdued inflation, and until the last few weeks, a weak dollar.\n\n\"The market moved already considerably in the first half of the year, so it has been a consolidation of the gains,\" said ABN Amro chief investment officer Didier Duret.\n\n\"The last three months were a kind of intermediary zone, between the hopes (for stimulus) generated by the U.S. administration and the confirmation that we have a strong recovery globally.\"\n\nA standout change since the end of the first half has been in the price of oil. LCOc1\n\nCrude was down 16.5 percent at the end of June, but its 20 percent rebound has hoisted it back into positive territory for the year. It has had its best quarter since the second quarter of 2016, marking its fifth quarterly gain of 20 percent or more in the last decade.\n\nMetals have also shone. Industrial bellwether copper CMCU3 has added almost 8 percent and zinc CMZN3 and nickel CMNI3 have jumped 14 and 11 percent respectively.\n\nThose commodity gains have been helped, as this graphic shows, by the weak dollar, which is still down for the year against most world currencies.\n\nThe 2.4 percent quarterly fall in the dollar index .DXY has been a relative improvement, though. It has also regained ground against the euro, the yen, China's yuan CNH=CNY= and Mexico's peso MXN= in recent weeks. The latter remains the world's second-best performer of 2017.\n\nThe euro EUR=, boosted by European Central Bank talk of winding down its more than 2 trillion-euro stimulus programme, is up more than 3 percent since the start of July and nearly 12 percent year-to-date.\n\nDebt in domestic emerging-market currencies has rallied .JGEGDCM.

China is up over 13 percent and Russia has surged more than 14 percent, though it is still down for the year.\n\nNetflix (NFLX.O) is up 20 percent, Facebook (FB.O) 10 percent, Apple (AAPL.O) 6 percent and Google (GOOGL.O) 4 percent, reflecting not just a global tech addiction but also the cheap money sloshing round markets.\n\nBritain may well be stuck in messy negotiations over quitting the European Union and an even messier domestic power struggle, but the pound has scored its third straight quarterly gain against the dollar and squeezed out a miniscule one against the euro.\n\nAt the bottom of the performance league table again is Greece.

What that means is that if you ever lock yourself out of Facebook or unable to regain immediate access, the social media platform's new feature [if it gets the final nod after the test] will require your face to verify your identity. It's the social media giant's very own version of Apple's Face ID.\n\nSometimes it becomes a big challenge receiving the two-factor authentication SMS -- and the facial recognition feature could come in handy. Asked to confirm if the company is indeed testing the feature, the company in a statement made available to TechCrunch said:\n\n\"We are testing a new feature for people who want to quickly and easily verify account ownership during the account recovery process. This optional feature is available only on devices you've already used to log in. It is another step, alongside two-factor authentication via SMS, that were taking to make sure account owners can confirm their identity.\"\n\nThe feature is still being tested by the social media giant, and could become available if all goes according to plan. Facebook and other social media giant continue to explore and test new ways to beat hackers and keep them at bay.\n\nIt's been established over the years that individuals and social media companies need to do more than just use strong passwords when securing their accounts -- things haven't really worked as expected.\n\nFacebook announced in January that it would allow users to link a token to their accounts. With it, you can log in from a new browser or geographic region. Then, plug the hardware into your computer and give it a tap. Doing so will convince the social media giant that you are the real owner of the account. It is one of the forms of a two-factor authentication system, which is a security method that adds another layer of protection to your logins, instead of just relying on your password.\n\nLast August, Instagram raised alarm over activities of hackers that threatened its network. This followed an Instagram bug that reportedly gave access to hackers to access contact phone numbers and email addresses of verified users.\n\nAccording to Instagram, the bug was discovered on its app programming interface. The application programming interface or API is used by the platform to communicate with other apps. The company did not give further details on exact users affected.\n\nUsers were therefore advised by Instagram to consider using stronger password, change it as often as possible, and use the two-factor authentication and emails to secure their accounts.\n\nPrior to that day, the Instagram account of music superstar, Selena Gomez with 125 million followers was taken down by hackers. The hackers secured access to Selena's account and were able to post some nude photos of her ex Justin Bieber. The account was, however, restored by Instagram later in the day.", "If you aren't attracted by the lack of changed-up design on the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED variants are still available and best of all, they feature a decent discount at Best Buy.\n\nBest Buy is having a sale for Apple's 2016 iPhone lineup and specifically for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED versions.

The carriers' pricing details reveal that you can save $150 on all versions but for that, you will have to comply with the monthly payment plan.\n\nIf not, then you can just opt for the unlocked models, but that is not going to be a smart decision because those models already carry a very high price tag. Luckily for you, all of these versions are only available in the 128GB and 32GB versions but for the sake of keeping your apps while updating to new software versions, it is highly recommended that you purchase the highest storage model being sold through Best Buy.\n\nOur other recommendation is that you purchase the iPhone 7 Plus since this model provides several exclusive features that are not present in the smaller 4.7-inch model. For example, a higher resolution coupled with a bigger battery capacity and of course the dual-camera lens with a 2x optical zoom upgrade is also a welcome addition to the 5.5-inch handset.\n\nIn terms of processing power, you get the A10 Fusion which is comfortably able to best chipsets like the Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895 and when it comes to future software updates, you are covered by Apple for several more years.\n\nDo you think this is a deal you will be looking forward to?

The $34.99 Echo Connect and $129.99 Echo Spot are expected to arrive on the market in December; the Echo Buttons, to be priced at two for $19.99, are awaiting approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, although Amazon said the devices will \"arrive in time for the holidays.\"\n\nDueling AIs\n\nAs the world's largest online retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon operates in a different space from other tech giants. However, its latest devices could bring heightened competitive worries to Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others, in part because of Amazon's large reach and typically lower-cost pricing.\n\nGuided by CEO Sundar Pichai's mission to make artificial intelligence \"work for everyone,\" Google, for instance, is working to broaden use of its intelligent agent Google Assistant -- its analog to Amazon's Alexa -- through its own smart-home speaker, Google Home. And the new 4K Amazon Fire TV poses a direct threat to Apple's new digital media player, Apple TV 4K, which was announced earlier this month and arrived in stores last Friday.\n\nWriting today in ZDNet, Steve Ranger called Amazon's latest Echo announcements a \"land grab\" for leadership in the smart-home device space.\n\n\"Amazon sells its hardware cheap because making money that way is not (at least for now) its priority,\" he said. \"This is a land-grab; whichever company reaches enough homes fast enough will become the effective standard.\"\n\nThe wider Amazon Alexa's reach into people's devices and homes becomes, the greater the threat it also poses to other intelligent assistants such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby.\n\nEnterprise Deals with BMW, Randstad\n\nAmazon yesterday also announced two big wins on the enterprise side of its business: a new deal with BMW to integrate Alexa into its vehicles, and a plan by staffing and recruitment company Randstad to move its IT infrastructure onto Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nUnder the BMW partnership, the Germany-based automaker expects to start making Amazon Alexa available in its BMW and Mini vehicles started in mid-2018. Alexa's assistance will be available via voice commands and will also be integrated with in-car visual control displays. The integration will let drivers ask for directions, launch phone calls, listen to music or news, check weather forecasts, and remotely control smart devices in their homes.\n\nThe Randstad deal, meanwhile, will see the company move its entire global IT infrastructure to AWS over the coming year.

And in it, the CEO of Microsoft doesn't focus on the remarkable story of his climb from middle-class kid in India to head of an American tech giant. Instead, he explores at length a feeling he's working to cultivate in himself: empathy.\n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise to people that big names like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are among the five or 10 most valuable companies on earth. But the fact that Microsoft is also on that shortlist surprises people.\n\nWhen I share this observation with CEO Satya Nadella, he manages to turn it into a compliment:\n\n\"I mean, at some level Microsoft is so ingrained in how the world economy works,\" he says. \"It's different than some of the other consumer brands out there.\"\n\nHe could have been combative or defensive. Nadella is a company man. (Now 50 years old, he's been at Microsoft more than half his life.) But that's not his style.\n\nThe Quest to Rediscover Microsoft's Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone\n\nby Satya Nadella, Greg Shaw and Jill Tracie Nichols\n\nHardcover, 272 pages |\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nHe's more the quiet, confident type -- the guy who never raises his voice or interrupts others; and who makes points playfully. When critics said Microsoft had grown into a fat bureaucracy, Nadella hopped on stage at a major tech conference with an Apple iPhone in his hand -- to show off the great Microsoft software in it. The point: Everyone, even the competition, relies on his brand.\n\nAsked if he likes playing supporting actor, he says: \"Oh yeah, I mean supporting actor role in a world that is increasingly digital is a very comfortable position to be in.\"\n\nThat said, he does acknowledge that the culture of Microsoft went downhill. The company had missed the mobile revolution. By the time he became CEO in 2014, critics say (and even Nadella suggests), very smart people at the company had turned very resentful and unmotivated. People stopped caring about what the customer needs, and there was infighting. A cartoonist once made a sketch of Microsoft employees pointing guns at each other (instead of at the rapidly growing competition).\n\nNadella admits in his book: It really got under his skin. There was truth to it. And what he explores is how he's had to work on himself -- his capacity for empathy -- to change that culture. Despite the wonky title, Hit Refresh is actually a meditation on the soul -- his and his company's.\n\nHe starts with a very personal confession -- about the birth of his first child. Nadella was 29 when Zain was born prematurely. While in the womb, the baby got strangled by his own umbilical cord. Doctors had to do an emergency C-section.\n\nJust hours earlier, Nadella and his wife Anu, like any new parents, were worried about the usual. \"Are we going to have his room and nursery ready? How was Anu going to get back to her architectural job that she'd just started? All of those concerns. Except our life changed,\" Nadella says.\n\nZain was born weighing just three pounds and with cerebral palsy. And, here is what Nadella admits: While his wife stepped up, he did not.\n\n\"Quite honestly, my first reaction was more about 'how could this happen to us?' It was only by watching her -- it was not that she was not trying to, in some sense, school me on it,\" he says, \"that I was perhaps able to come to that realization.\"\n\nThe realization that it wasn't about him. It was about a newborn fighting hard to survive. And it was Nadella's job to help.\n\nThis ability to empathize becomes key as he looks at those Microsoft workers who are pointing fingers. His natural reflex, he says, is to judge them, to be annoyed. But then he pulls back and remembers: They're complaining because they're hungry to do more. And it's his job to give them hope. \"Those are all things that I've grown in. I don't think that this is all sort of some innate thing that I had.\"\n\nAs he describes the many meetings, big and small, where he's had to push himself to be a different leader, he explains how experts from other disciplines have shaped his thinking. Literary theorist Terry Eagleton says culture is \"a kind of social unconscious\" made iteratively through the everyday customs and practices of people. Nadella, a technologist, says the \"razor precision\" of that description has helped him pay attention to how simple acts shape a collective mindset.\n\nStrategic decisions seem to come more intuitively to Nadella. When he stepped into the CEO position, he very clearly bet on the cloud. He wanted to turn Microsoft into a \"cloud first\" company that, like Amazon, is a go-to for storing everyone else's data. And, going a step further, he wanted to make Microsoft the company that helps others mine their own data for insights (Facebook and Google shouldn't be the only ones with that superpower).\n\nHe's also made some very hard, even cold decisions. When Nadella decided Microsoft can't beat Apple or Samsung at making smartphones, he axed his 18,000 employees working on it. How does a man who preaches empathy explain that? \"I was thinking of the 100,000 people who work at Microsoft and how the future of this company would be jeopardized if I didn't pick right,\" he says.\n\nCEOs don't typically write books about turning around their companies while they're still doing it. That's exactly what Nadella has done, and in page after page of Hit Refresh, he reflects deeply on the emotional and intellectual reasoning behind his hard choices.", "TALLINN: The EU will propose a new tax on tech giants such as Google and Facebook next year despite opposition by several states that fear a blow to their economies, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said Friday.\n\nChampioned by French President Emmanuel Macron, the new tax on digital multinationals will target revenue generated in an EU country, instead of on profits that are booked in a low-tax EU headquarters, often Ireland or Luxembourg.\n\nThe hope is to have a formal proposal by EU ministers in December, that would become a draft law by the commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2018.\n\n\"Tax has to be paid where it is due, be it offline or online,\" Juncker said after an EU summit in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\n\"The commission will propose next year new rules on fair and effective taxation that provides legal certainty and a level playing field for all.\"\n\nJuncker made the commitment after Macron pressed the issue at the second day of the summit, where the leaders discussed the opportunities and dangers of the digital economy.\n\nIndian car buyers are increasingly moving onlineLeading carmakers like Renault, Hyundai, Honda say online sales range from 10% to 20%, up from almost zero in 2015.\n\nThe push by France, already backed by powerful Germany, is part of a wider onslaught by the EU on Google and other US tech behemoths as Europe seeks ways to regulate Silicon Valley more tightly.\n\nIn a closely watched speech on Europe Tuesday, Macron thundered against high tech companies that had become the \"freeloaders of the modern world.\"\n\nSo far about a dozen of the EU's 28 member states have signed on to the idea, though many urge action to take place on a global level, such as the G20, instead of just in Europe.\n\nEurope-wide tax reform is a huge headache in the European Union, requiring unanimity of all 28 states, which has proven nearly impossible on tax issues.\n\nAlready smaller EU states have expressed strong resistance to the idea, which they say will chase US tech giants from their shores, especially Ireland that serves as a low-tax hub for Apple, Facebook and Google.\n\n\"If we want Europe to become digital leader, the solution isn't more taxes and more regulation, it's actually the opposite,\" said Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.\n\nFor the latest news, tech news, breaking news headlines and live updates checkout Gadgetsnow.comSee AlsoMoto G5 (3 GB, Lunar Grey)\u20b9 12499BUY NOWMoto G5 (3GB, Fine Gold)\u20b9 11900BUY NOWChevron Motorola Moto G5 [5 inch] Tempered Glass\u20b9 299BUY NOW", "Apple released more details about the iPhone X's Face ID feature when it published a new privacy site Wednesday, addressing some of the concerns that people have had since the face-scanning feature was announced.\n\nWhen Apple unveiled the feature, which can unlock phones and be used for payments, it spurred not only a thousand alarming think pieces, but also a letter from Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., asking how the company will protect the data. There have also been worries about how much to trust Face ID. The company's first public demo of Face ID didn't go that smoothly, after all - at one point, the demonstrator had to skip the face scan and enter his password instead.\n\nThe most telling answers on Face ID come from a white paper the company's posted on its security.\n\nThe information collected by Face ID won't leave your device, the company reiterates on the site. Apple also lays out exactly what it's storing: infrared images of your face captured when you first start Face ID, the mathematical representations of your face it calculates during that enrolment and whatever other images the phone deems necessary to account for changes to your face (a beard growing over time, for example). Images are also cropped close to your face to avoid grabbing any background information.\n\nThere are also several instances when Face ID won't work. These include when:\n\nThis last tip, at least in part, addresses concerns that people will not be able to stop others from using Face ID to open an individual's phone without consent. And by activating the Emergency SOS, you'll also be dialing an emergency number and disabling the Touch ID and Face ID features.\n\nThat should help users worried about being asked to open their phones under duress, such as while being mugged. That is, if they have the time to activate it when needed.\n\nApple's new privacy site is a comprehensive website and more reader-friendly than any other tech giant's privacy center. Still, it's a lot of reading and a reminder of all the information we're entrusting to Apple and its philosophies on data protection.\n\nOverall, what really may be most useful for people looking at this site is the articulation from Apple about how it views privacy as they push further into personal wearable devices and home hubs. The fact that it's made this knowledge center at all shows that it will continue to try to provide more personalized services with a privacy bent.\n\n\u00a9 2017 The Washington Post"]}, "Tesla": {"2017-09-28": ["By Gene Posted on September 28, 2017\n\nAs relief efforts continue to take place in Puerto Rico after a Category 4 storm, Hurricane Maria, caused widespread devastation and created an island-wide black out, California-based Tesla is shipping hundreds of Powerwall battery systems to the unincorporated U.S. territory and restoring electricity to some 3.5 million residents left without power. Tesla's Powerwall battery system, first introduced in 2015, is designed to be a residential stationary energy storage unit that can be charged through solar panels.\n\nTesla continues to send shipments of Powerwall systems into the region and working with local organizations on restoring electrical power back to the island. Tesla employees are currently on site and working on pairing its Powerwall battery systems to solar panels. A Tesla spokesperson has confirmed that the company continues to ship Powerwall systems into the storm-ravaged island that's located 1,000 miles south east of Florida.\n\nIn addition to sending hundreds of Powerwall systems into Puerto Rico, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has personally donated $250,000 to aid in relief efforts, according to Fortune.\n\nTesla's effort to help victims of Hurricane Maria follows recent efforts made in South Florida after the company unlocked more battery range for Model S and Model X owners affected by Hurricane Irma through an over-the-air software update, extending the electric vehicle's battery capacity from 60 kWh to 75 kWh.\n\nTesla aids Puerto Rico in relief efforts, sends Powerwall systems to help restore power\n\nInterested in solar?

Wochit\n\n237 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCar and energy company Tesla, striving for a world in which renewables play a more prominent role in production and storage, is eyeing an expansion into storm-ravaged islands of the Caribbean - and it could become a key player in shaping grids of the future.\n\nThe historic destruction wrought by hurricanes Irma and Maria on the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this month downed once operational and largely fossil fuel-powered grids, opening up the possibility for companies like Tesla to move in and establish a presence.\n\nIf utilities are restored with an eye toward the future, experts say, the islands might host new types of grids that could one day migrate to other parts of the world.\n\n\"I think entities like Tesla are going to be part of that story,\" said Francis O'Sullivan, director of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's MIT Energy Initiative. \"They're building a technology package that will be needed.\"\n\n[Tesla remotely extends range of vehicles to help with hurricane evacuations]\n\n[Mars, moon base and BFR: Things we learned from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk]\n\n'Send Tesla'\n\nTwelve days after the southern half of Hurricane Irma swept over St. John, the smallest of three main U.S. Virgin Islands, a desperate survivor of the Category 5 storm used debris from a nearby home to spell out \"Send Tesla,\" according to an aerial photo captured by international news agency Reuters.\n\nSocial media postings noted that Tesla did send at least one representative to the island and began \"signing up\" survivors for solar services. Due to the island's compromised communications infrastructure, however, residents could not be contacted to gather additional details. Tesla would not officially confirm the reports.\n\nBut industry analysts and Tesla insiders say the Elon Musk-led company that builds electric cars and includes energy products in its portfolio is interested in the U.S. territory and possibly other storm-damaged islands in the Caribbean as a way to expand its influence.\n\nFor Tesla, these aren't uncharted waters - the company has already built solar energy production and storage \"Powerpacks\" in American Samoa and Hawaii. The futuristic centers include solar panels and enclosed batteries that reduce demand on traditional diesel-fueled grids that are common on islands. In the case of Hawaii's Kaua'i Island, for example, the system is expected to reduce fossil fuel demands up to 50 percent by 2019, alleviating the need for transporting and burning diesel.\n\nBut larger, more industrial approaches aren't the only things Tesla can offer. It's directly targeting consumers with products such as the \"Powerwall\" and solar roof tiles that look and act like typical roofing, but can charge a Tesla-built battery connected to the home. The batteries can increase a home's reliance on renewables, feed power back into the grid and operate as backups in the event of an outage.\n\nPhotos: Tesla's solar and battery advancements Fullscreen A Tesla Powerpack connected to solar panels on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.

A benefit of their efforts, of course, is putting that technology on display not only for future consumers to see, but regulators, too.\n\nMark Mills, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a New York City-based think tank, said the establishment of renewable systems are initially more expensive partially due to the requirement of high-capacity batteries to provide power at night, but hybridizing them with more traditional technologies could be ideal.\n\n\"It's not a crazy solution,\" Mills said, noting that sunny islands are logical destinations for solar solutions such as Tesla's Powerwall and Powerpack. \"In situations like this, it's entirely possible in many communities, especially hybridized.\"\n\nMills, however, cautioned that while the systems can be more flexible, that doesn't make them impervious - solar panels can still be destroyed, eliminating a key power source for home-based or centralized batteries.\n\nA good demonstration\n\nMusk's endeavors undeniably gravitate toward high-barrier-of-entry, entrenched markets: SpaceX in the rocketry business and Tesla taking on auto manufacturers and the energy market, to name a few.\n\nEven those vehicle offerings could play a role during and after a natural disaster, according to James Fenton, director of the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cocoa, who also said the islands face an opportunity to embrace new technologies.\n\n\"Solar is the right thing,\" he said. \"Energy storage isn't there yet, but it will be there and I think it's a combination of including transportation. And you can design your islands to do that if you get your vehicles to use electricity.\"\n\nThe developments spearheaded on these islands are demonstrations of renewable capabilities that could one day spread to other parts of the globe ranging from well-developed markets to ones with non-existent infrastructure, such as portions of Africa and India.\n\n[West Melbourne to get Space Coast's first Tesla Supercharger station]\n\n[SpaceX files 'Starlink' trademark for satellite internet constellation, revealing details]\n\nIt helps that Tesla offers a full, polished package: the solar panels needed to supply energy, the batteries produced at its massive Nevada Gigafactory (one of several planned), and additional hardware needed to integrate its products into grids and homes. The expertise and know-how to work and troubleshoot these systems is available, too.\n\nBut the company's efforts in energy, while impactful, likely won't be as lucrative as they may seem. The industry operates on tight margins and uses expensive, research-heavy technologies, but renewables help round the sharp corners on the vision of a post-carbon world.\n\n\"Part of the appeal of Tesla is locked in how the company is trying to be more transformative in a bigger sense,\" O'Sullivan said. \"They're not just trying to sell you a car; they're trying to sell you a better way of consuming life.\"\n\n\"That is the inherent value of their brand. Being involved in something that feels very new like delivering electricity in a new way to these storm-ravaged islands is an important part of the dimension,\" he said.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

In the past, a Model X owner would only get an award for referring a new user to buy another Model X. Thus continues Tesla's mission to turn all Tesla automotive and device owners into pseudo salespeople for their products of all sorts.\n\nThe Tesla referral program includes a number of Referrer Awards as well as Buyer Benefits in their referral program as of September 28th, 2017. Several of these details have been changed since the program's last update. The person that did the referring gets Referrer Awards, while Buyer Benefits go to the person that was referred to buy.\n\nBuyer Benefits for the Model X and Model X include Unlimited Supercharging and a $1,000 purchase credit. OF Note - this credit only works for those referred buyers that make their purchase before October 31st, 2017. The one Buyer Benefit for buying Solar Panels from Tesla is a 5-year extended warranty.\n\nReferrer Awards for the first 4 referrals of Tesla Solar Panels is $750 credit or a cool $400 in cold, hard cash. The 5th referral will result in an award of a Founders Series Powerwall 2.\n\nReferrer Awards for a Model X and S include a Model S for Kids or a Signature Black WallConnector for the first two referrals. For 3 referrals, awards include Arachnids/Turbines or a week to borrow a Model X or S - like a week's rental of a car, for free. For 4 referrals, the referrer will receive a Founders Series Powerwall 2.\n\nThe award for 5 referrals for Model S or X vehicles gets a little more interesting. In addition to a single Solar Roof Token, the referrer will get one Unveiling Invitation. That's an invitation to a Tesla event where their next product will be shown. Qualifying for this award before October 15 will get referrers a ticket to see the Tesla Semi Truck. After that, tickets will be for whatever event is next.\n\nThis is just the latest update to Tesla's referral program - and it won't be the last. Drop down into the timeline below for additional recent bits and pieces from the Tesla universe.", "Maye Musk, the mother of Tesla founder Elon Musk, is a new face of Covergirl, the makeup brand announced Wednesday.\n\nDuring her five-decade-long career, the 69-year-old model has appeared on the everything from the cover of Time to a Beyonc\u00e9 video and a Special K cereal box. Musk, a mother of three and grandmother of 10, also boasts two master's degrees, in dietetics and nutritional science. The model signed with IMG, the agency that represents Gigi Hadid and Joan Smalls, in 2016.\n\nSEE ALSO: Elon Musk won't give family members early access or discounts for a Tesla\n\nMusk will join a roster of new Covergirls, including television personality Ayesha Curry and writer-actor Issa Rae.\n\n\"Who knew, after many years of admiring the gorgeous COVERGIRL models, that I would be one at 69 years of age?\" she wrote. \"It just shows, never give up.\"", "The boss of Tesla Inc. will descend on South Australia on Friday to unveil progress on a giant battery seen critical to averting crippling power shortages in the state. Musk has promised to have the battery packs in place at a huge wind farm by Dec. 1 -- the start of the southern hemisphere summer -- to help South Australia avoid a repeat of a state-wide blackout last year.\n\nFor the billionaire, who has a habit of hatching ambitious ideas ranging from an 800-mph solar-powered hyperloop to a space-based Internet, it's not just reputation that's on the line. He's pledged to provide the battery installation in Australia's outback for free if he can't get it working within 100 days of a contract being signed.\n\n\"It is a juggle for Elon, no doubt,\" said Geoff James, research principal for the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney. \"I'm quietly confident this will be the project people look to for battery storage. Co-locating batteries and generation is quite quickly going to become the norm.\"\n\nRead more: Why resource-rich Australia is struggling to keep the lights on\n\nThe chief executive officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is also expected during his trip to set out his pitch for an unmanned mission to Mars and to roll out a supercharger network to power electric cars.\n\nMusk, 46, will speak Friday afternoon at the 68th International Astronautical Congress, a gathering of more than 4,000 space enthusiasts in the state capital of Adelaide. He'll give an update on his plans to \"Make Humans a Multiplanetary Species,\" hinting on Twitter that he'll discuss how to pay for the large rockets and spacecraft that'll be needed to ferry human beings to the red planet.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk posted a simulation on Instagram of how SpaceX's \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" will work and said he'll unveil a new version Friday afternoon.\n\nMusk then travels 150 miles (241 kilometers) north to the Hornsdale Wind Farm for a Tesla Energy event. Under an agreement between French renewable energy company Neoen, Tesla and the South Australian government, the wind farm near Jamestown in the state's north will expand to become the largest generator of renewable energy in the state and be paired with Tesla's planned battery installation.\n\nIn March, Musk said on Twitter that the cost of the battery storage project would be $250 a kilowatt-hour at the pack level, but noted that shipping, taxes, tariffs and installation labor vary by country. The project may cost A$120 million ($94 million), according to a research note from Bloomberg New Energy Finance senior associate Ali Asghar.\n\n\"We caution that a first-of-a-kind project like this could end up costing more than an average project,\" Asghar said.\n\nFor South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, who uses a photo of himself with Musk as his Twitter profile, making sure Tesla delivers is critical to his hopes of keeping the lights on this summer. For Musk, a successful roll-out may build investor confidence and attract more orders from states and nations embarking on a switch to clean energy.\n\nIf it works \"there's 50 other geographies around the world that will want a giant battery,\" said Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian tech billionaire who hatched the 100-days-or-it's-free deal with Musk on social media.\n\nThe stakes could barely be higher for Musk given the sheer scale of the battery, Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian Corp., said in an interview last month.\n\n\"It will be three times bigger than any battery man has ever produced and created,\" he said. \"And it has to be installed by Dec. 1 or it's free. It's going to be a $100 million hole in his results if he doesn't. There's a lot of pressure on getting it done.\"\n\nThough Palo Alto, California-based Tesla is best known for making electric cars, the company sells its lithium-ion batteries to utilities eager for cost-effective ways to integrate renewable sources of power like solar and wind into their electric grids. Tesla also acquired solar panel installer SolarCity last November and markets a home battery called the Powerwall to consumers.", "Elon Musk should probably get his facts straight before challenging Mercedes. Tesla has been fighting a lone battle in the EV war, but that will soon change as major automakers with big budgets like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz and even Porsche are about to unleash an army of electric cars that could pose a serious threat to the automaker. Mercedes recently announced a $1 billion investment to expand its Alabama plant where the EQ crossover will be built. This seemed like a paltry investment which left CEO Elon Musk decidedly unimpressed- but this was only half the story.", "Product releases aren't the only ways that car manufacturers, both traditional and novel, make headlines. Throughout this week, the automotive news cycle focused as much on current events such as Porsche's new Nurburgring lap record, as it did on preparation for things to come, including Mercedes-Benz's $1-billion investment in its Tuscaloosa, Ala., plant.\n\nWhat's more, in the wakes of a series of devastating hurricanes, OEMs also have been in the news for their humanitarian efforts, just as NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson has. Here are three stories that made headlines throughout the automotive world this week:\n\nVacuum Manufacturer Dyson To Invest \u00a32B To Build Electric Cars\n\nDyson is applying the technical know-how it's acquired from manufacturing its bagless vacuums and bladeless fans to build electric vehicles. The British tech firm announced Tuesday that it plans to put an EV on sale by 2020 that will use a next-generation solid state battery.\n\nCompany founder James Dyson claims the project has been in the works for two years, and already has 400 workers dedicated to it. What's more, Dyson is opting not to partner with a traditional OEM. Instead, Dyson has pledged to invest \u00a32 billion ($2.69 billion) toward the all-electric car.\n\nElon Musk Has Twitter Spat With Mercedes' Parent Company Over EV Investment\n\nElon Musk has long been vocal of his desire for more players in the EV market, claiming it aligns with Tesla's mission to \"accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\" But Sunday, his want of competition sparked a bit of controversy on Twitter.\n\nThe tech mogul replied to a tweet from USA TODAY about Mercedes-Benz's $1-billon investment to produce its all-electric SUV in Alabama, and suggested that figure had one too few zeros for \"a giant like Daimler/Mercedes.\" His post caught Daimler's eye, prompting the German company to send him a link to an announcement it made last year.\n\nDaimler's statement from 2016 outlined its $10 billion investment -- the exact sum Musk wanted -- to establish its EQ (Electric Intelligence) sub-brand.\n\nHyundai Gives Hurricane Harvey Hero Car To Celebrate Three-Millionth Elantra Sold In US\n\nSome automakers commemorate milestones simply by distributing press releases -- but not Hyundai. The Korean manufacturer recently sold its three-millionth Elantra in the United States, and celebrated by gifting one to Hurricane Harvey first responder Henry Rogers.\n\nRogers is a paramedic field supervisor for Acadian Ambulance, and worked non-stop for 48 hours helping residents of the Houston area during Harvey, reportedly saving multiple people's lives. What's more, after that two-day stint, he returned home to Baytown, Texas, where he rescued his wife and dog from their flooded home.", "Automobile manufacturers shipped. Yet Wall Street values Tesla higher than any other U.S. car manufacturer.What explains this more than 1,000 to 1 discrepancy in valuation?\n\nThe future.\n\nToo many people compare Tesla to what already exists and that's a mistake. Tesla is not another car company.\n\nAt the turn of the 20 century most people compared existing buggy and carriage manufacturers to the new automobile companies. They were both transportation, and they looked vaguely similar, with the only apparent difference that one was moved by horses attached to the front while the other had an unreliable and very noisy internal combustion engine.\n\nThey were different. And one is now only found in museums. Companies with business models built around internal combustion engines disrupted those built around horses. That's the likely outcome for every one of today's automobile manufacturers. Tesla is a new form of transportation disrupting the incumbents.\n\nElectric cars pollute less, have fewer moving parts, are quieter and faster than existing cars. Today, the technology necessary (affordable batteries with sufficient range) for them to be a viable business have all just come together. Most observers agree that autonomous electric cars will be the dominate form of transportation by mid-century. That's bad news for existing car companies.\n\nFirst, car companies have over a century of expertise in designing and building efficient mechanical propulsion systems - internal combustion engines for motive power and transmissions to drive the wheels. If existing car manufacturers want to build electric vehicles, all those design skills and most of the supply chain and manufacturing expertise are useless. And not only useless but they become this legacy of capital equipment and headcount that is now a burden to a company. In a few years, the only thing useful in existing factories building traditional cars will be the walls and roof.\n\nSecond, while the automotive industry might be 1000 times larger than Tesla, Tesla may actually have more expertise and dollars committed to the electric car ecosystem than any legacy car company. Tesla's investment in Lithium/Ion battery factory (the Gigafactory), its electric drive train design and manufacturing output exceed the sum of the entire automotive industry.\n\nThird, the future of transportation is not only electric, it's autonomous and connected. A lot has been written about self-driving cars and as a reminder, automated driving comes in multiple levels:\n\nEach level of autonomy requires an exponential amount of software engineering design and innovation. While cars have had an ever-increasing amount of software content, the next generation of transportation are literally computers on wheels. Much like in electric vehicle drive trains, autonomy and connectivity are not core competencies of existing car companies.\n\nFourth, large, existing companies are executing a known business model and have built processes, procedures and key performance indicators to measure progress to a known set of goals. But when technology disruption happens (electric drive trains, autonomous vehicles, etc.) changing a business model is extremely difficult. Very few companies manage to make the transition from one business model to another.\n\nAnd while Tesla might be the first mover in disrupting transportation there is no guarantee they will be the ultimate leader. However, the question shouldn't be why Tesla has such a high valuation.\n\nThe question should be why the existing automobile companies aren't valued like horse and buggy companies.", "ISIS recruiter's wife wins right to appeal testifying in a niqab\n\nTech tycoon Elon Musk is back in Adelaide to check on progress on two major projects.\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is back in Adelaide to deliver updates on two key projects - his plan for a mission to Mars and building the world's largest lithium-ion battery.\n\nMr Musk will speak first on Friday afternoon at the International Astronautical Congress where he'll detail his latest design for his SpaceX company's Interplanetary Transport System, the giant rocket and spaceship.\n\nHe has teased about the latest developments in recent days, releasing an Instagram video that shows a simulated launch and also tweeting that the \"design feels right\".\n\n\"This should be worth seeing,\" he said.\n\nLater on Friday, Mr Musk will travel to Jamestown, in SA's mid north, where his Tesla company is building the battery which will play an integral part of the state's $550 million energy plan to avoid major blackouts and electricity shortages.\n\nThe battery is to be located next to a major wind farm and will be used to store power generated by the turbines that can be released into the network to ensure greater stability for the grid.\n\nThe Tesla boss previously made the bold promise to deliver the battery within 100 days or provide it for free.\n\nHe stood by that promise during his first visit to Adelaide earlier this year.\n\nHowever it's understood the clock will not start ticking on the 100-day commitment until regulators approve the project, clearing it for grid connection.", "Negative comments from analysts have helped take some of the froth out of Tesla's stock\n\nTesla Inc. shares are nearing their second straight week of losses, down nearly 4% on the heels of a recent record close and a few negative analyst views.\n\nTesla TSLA, -0.48% stock ended at a record $385 on Sept. 18, and in the days since is down more than 14%. Shares have underperformed the broader market in recent months, although they are still outpacing the market so far this year.\n\nThere was \"a lot of good news for Tesla\" in past months, including meeting important deadlines with the Model 3, but the shares have been overvalued for a while, said Efraim Levy, an analyst with CFRA, who has a sell rating on the stock.\n\nIn recent weeks, negative news flow included Elon Musk's announcement that the Tesla semi truck would be unveiled in October, rather than September, and a few negative analyst opinions, he said.\n\nRelated: A Model 3 fail could lead to a 'moment of panic' for Tesla: Bernstein\n\nEarlier this week analysts at Bernstein took a deep dive into Tesla's cash burn, keeping their neutral rating on the stock but concluding that a botched Model 3 ramp-up could spark a selloff in the stock.\n\nTesla unveiled the Model 3, its first mass-market offering, in July as expected and has promised a production ramp-up starting in the fourth quarter.\n\nLast week, a day after the shares's record close, analysts at Jefferies started their coverage of Tesla stock, forecasting that Tesla will lose money at least through 2019, which is a year longer than most other analysts are expecting. The Jefferies analysts called the consensus \"too optimistic.\"\n\nThe two cautious views on Tesla were tempered by a more optimistic note earlier this week from analysts at Morgan Stanley, who predicted millions of Teslas on the road in the next few years, giving the company a leg-up on data gathering and machine-learning training.\n\nSee also: Tesla car population will explode within a few years, Morgan Stanley says\n\nTesla shares have lost 9% in the past three months, versus gains of 2.8% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.14% and 4.4% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.22% Quarterly losses have mounted to more than 6%, contrasting with a 3.6% rise for the benchmark. So far this year, however, the stock is up 58%, about five times the 2017 gains for the S&P.", "Model S sales have been challenged recently. With just a few days left in the quarter, here's what to expect from the important vehicle's sales in Q3.\n\nWith electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slated to report vehicle deliveries for its third quarter next week, one of the more interesting facets of the report will be the company's Model S deliveries. Launched in 2012, the electric vehicle is Tesla's oldest model that is still in production; its sales have been challenged recently.\n\nThough Tesla's Model S deliveries were up 23% year over year in the company's second quarter, the model's deliveries were down 11% sequentially. It has been over a year since Model S sales last peaked. Could Model S sales see another sequential decline in Q3? Or will they pick back up?\n\nAfter peaking in the fourth quarter of 2015 at more than 17,000 deliveries, Model S sales have been at least several thousand units lower in all but one quarter ever since. In Tesla's most recent quarter, Model S deliveries were about 12,000, or about 5,000 units lower than fourth-quarter deliveries in 2015.\n\nThe lower quarterly deliveries have coincided with Tesla's ramp-up in Model X deliveries, suggesting the similarly priced SUV has cannibalized some demand for the sedan. Though the Model X was launched toward the end of 2015, the SUV's production and deliveries didn't begin to pick up steam until the first quarter of 2015. And the SUVs deliveries have continued higher, with trailing-12-month deliveries up 450% year over year. In its most recent quarter, the automaker delivered about 10,000 Model X units -- just 2,000 units shy of Model S deliveries in the quarter.\n\nBut despite sales trends that may, on the surface, suggest Model S deliveries will continue lower sequentially in Q3, a sequential rebound is likely.\n\nFirst of all, both Model S and X deliveries were impacted by what Tesla called \"a severe production shortfall\" as the company ran into some detours producing its new 100 kWh battery packs. The shortfall was so bad that production during the quarter averaged about 40% below demand until early June, or the last month of the quarter, Tesla said. The elimination of this production constraint should help Model S production and deliveries in Q3.\n\nSecond, orders for Model S were increasing \"leading up to and following the Model 3 handover event [on July 28],\" management said in the company's Aug. 2-released second-quarter shareholder letter.\n\nThird, Tesla made several changes to its product lineup during the quarter that could have helped drive incremental Model S sales. Most notably, Tesla lowered the price of its highest-end Model S units, making the longest-range and fastest-accelerating version $5,000 cheaper. The price cut to models with 100 kWh batteries reflected \"cost efficiency improvements of approximately 3%,\" management told press. In addition, Tesla also warned customers toward the end of the quarter that they would be discontinuing the rear-wheel-drive Model S, which was the cheapest version. The news could have sparked some customers who were on the fence to pull the trigger before they no longer had the opportunity to buy the rear-wheel-drive version.\n\nFinally, though Tesla didn't break out its expectations for Model S and Model X specifically, it guided for combined Model S and X deliveries in the second half of the year to be above deliveries in the first half. In other words, management clearly wasn't anticipating any production or demand headwinds for either model.\n\nTesla releases its quarterly vehicle deliveries within three calendar days of each quarter's end. So expect Tesla to report vehicle deliveries no later than Oct. 3.", "SIR JAMES DYSON does not lack ambition. In an e-mail to the staff of his electrical-appliance company on September 26th he reiterated his long-held desire to \"find a solution to the global problem of air pollution\". His audacious scheme is to add an electric vehicle to the catalogue of pricey vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers already manufactured by the company that he owns.\n\nHis plan to invest \u00a32bn ($2.7bn), split evenly between battery technology and vehicle development, shows that the barriers to entry in the battery-powered vehicle business are much lower than those in the market for cars with complex internal-combustion engines. But Sir James may find that the barriers to success are more formidable.\n\nDetails of his new project are thin. Sir James said that he had assembled a team of over 400 people and was still recruiting, with the aim of launching a vehicle in 2020. It seems likely that the first cars will aim at the luxury market, a niche that Tesla has to itself. The California-based electric-car maker, which was founded less than 15 years ago, hopes to make half a million cars in 2018. It is surely the firm that Sir James means to emulate. But Tesla has tapped investors for $10bn since 2012 and has yet to make an annual profit. The experience of Apple is as instructive. The computer giant recently abandoned plans to make its own cars when the cost and complexity of the task became apparent. Instead it will concentrate on self-driving systems.\n\nDyson's manufacturing nous puts it in a stronger starting position than Apple, though managing the supply chain for a vacuum cleaner hardly compares to that for a car. The firm's experience with batteries, gained from its cordless cleaners, is an advantage. And the solid-state battery technology that it is pursuing could prove much cheaper and more efficient than the lithium-ion batteries currently used by all other carmakers. Toyota is trying to make the same battery breakthrough. Sceptics question whether the technology is yet anywhere close to mass production.\n\nEven if a Dyson car is ready to hit the road in 2020, Sir James faces other obstacles. Though demand for electric vehicles is expected to grow quickly as governments turn against the internal-combustion engine, there may soon be a traffic jam at the high end of the market. Next year Jaguar is due to launch the iPace, a competitor to Tesla's Model S. Porsche, Audi and BMW all have models that will arrive by 2020. They may be joined by others from a host of startups. Finding buyers is another challenge. Tesla has had to spend heavily setting up its own retail network to sidestep the established dealerships of big carmakers.\n\nThe badge on the front of a luxury car is all-important. A brand shared with washroom hand-dryers may lack sufficient allure. But in 24 years Dyson has become a company with revenues of \u00a32.5bn, a triumph of marketing as much as clever technology. That knack for salesmanship could translate to the car business. Sir James, like Elon Musk of Tesla, seems untroubled by self-doubt. It remains to be seen whether he can clean up again -- or whether the car business will simply hoover up his fortune.", "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is back in Adelaide to deliver updates on two key projects - his plan for a mission to Mars and building the world's largest lithium-ion battery.\n\nMr Musk will speak first on Friday afternoon at the International Astronautical Congress where he'll detail his latest design for his SpaceX company's Interplanetary Transport System, the giant rocket and spaceship.\n\nHe has teased about the latest developments in recent days, releasing an Instagram video that shows a simulated launch and also tweeting that the \"design feels right\".\n\n\"This should be worth seeing,\" he said.\n\nLater on Friday, Mr Musk will travel to Jamestown, in SA's mid north, where his Tesla company is building the battery which will play an integral part of the state's $550 million energy plan to avoid major blackouts and electricity shortages.\n\nThe battery is to be located next to a major wind farm and will be used to store power generated by the turbines that can be released into the network to ensure greater stability for the grid.\n\nThe Tesla boss previously made the bold promise to deliver the battery within 100 days or provide it for free.\n\nHe stood by that promise during his first visit to Adelaide earlier this year.\n\nHowever it's understood the clock will not start ticking on the 100-day commitment until regulators approve the project, clearing it for grid connection.", "Half a million people have already plunked down $1,000 to reserve a Tesla Model 3 all-electric sedan. They're so high in demand, in fact, that even Elon Musk's mother says she's nowhere near the front of the list to receive one.\n\nMaye Musk, who at 69 years old just became the latest CoverGirl, told The New York Times that she will patiently wait her turn for Tesla's more affordable, less luxurious offering.\n\n\"I haven't gotten the [Model] 3 yet,\" she told the Times. \"I'm at around 300,000. Even though I have good connections, I can't jump the line.\"\n\nThe first 30 Tesla Model 3 vehicles rolled onto public streets back in July. All 30 were given to Tesla employees -- a wise move for the company, should any electronics or mechanical parts malfunction.\n\nNow, Tesla is on the hook to massively ramp up production of the cars, which start at $35,000. The general production plan lacks any true statistics, but is depicted blow.\n\n\"The major challenge for us over the six to nine months is how do we build a huge number of cars,\" Musk said at the July Model 3 launch event, as reported by CNBC. \"Frankly, we're going to be in production hell.\"\n\nIn July, Musk tweeted that Tesla should produce \"above 1,500\" cars by the end of September. This number, according to Musk, will inflate to 20,000 vehicles by December.\n\nIf Tesla boosts this production up to 30,000 vehicles per month by early next year, Maye Musk should receive her Model 3 around November 2018. It's going to be a long year for everyone waiting, but hopefully those who reserved the vehicle are comforted by the fact that even Elon's mom has to wait to receive her reserved vehicle.", "It's no secret that the car has always been a status symbol, and is even seen by some as an extension of their character. Are you a BMW or an Audi person? Are you about fuel efficiency or speed? Are you trying to wow onlookers or are you just trying to get your family from A to B?\n\nFrom a marketing and PR perspective, with over 95% of vehicle shoppers now using digital channels to research cars, social is pivotal. It's become a virtual showroom for the world to see the latest products on the market and what's coming in the future.\n\nBut as with many industries, the automotive sector is starting to experience the kind of disruption that's seriously altering the status quo. BMW, Ford, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Toyota and other auto stalwarts are seeing challenges from a new generation of electric and soon autonomous vehicles - from relatively new brands like Tesla to non-automotive brands like Google and Apple.\n\nThat's we at Talkwalker decided to do a deep dive into the automotive industry on social media for our latest report, to see who's racing to the front and who's getting left in the dust. And our research uncovered one story, in particular, that stood out.\n\nThere are many different facets of our report that I think merit discussion, but for me, the most fascinating is the incredible strength of Tesla from a social media marketing perspective. Here's a brand that was founded just fifteen years ago, makes comparatively little money relative to automotive giants, yet on social media, they are in the top three - outperforming Volkswagen, Ford and Toyota, to name but a few.\n\nThis is pretty staggering - we've done a great deal of industry social media analyses in our time and as a general rule, bigger companies tend to outperform their smaller rivals. There are exceptions of course, but for a company that's almost 30x smaller than its rivals, to perform so well is pretty much unheard of.\n\nBelow is a graph showing the total mentions across social channels of twenty-nine of the world's biggest car brands:\n\nThere's still some hesitancy from CEOs when to taking to social media, but Elon Musk certainly doesn't fit into that category. In fact, I think there is an argument to be made that Musk's public popularity has a greater impact on his company than any other business leader.\n\nFrom a follower numbers perspective, only Bill Gates with 38m+ followers can overcome Musk's 12.5 million on Twitter - but it's more than just his \"numbers\".\n\nFrom a social perspective, Musk is also pretty personal. From talking about his new business ideas during his drive home to live tweeting rocket launches, his posts offer an inside view of what he cares about and is interested in at any particular moment. And he's not afraid to talk about failure either:\n\nCompare this to other CEOs on social with similar name recognition - say Tim Cook of Apple or Satya Nadella of Microsoft, who mostly focus on corporate updates with occasional forays into current affairs.\n\nThis isn't an approach that necessarily works for everyone, but when you've built a hype machine as Tesla has done, the rules of social media start to change.\n\nInstead of following the usual guidelines of \"tweet this much, include videos\" etc., you start to make your own. Tesla has only tweeted four times this month.\n\nWhy? Because they don't really need to do any more than that. Despite this lack of activity they are still in the top three most talked about car brands this month.\n\nAnd when they do tweet?\n\nThis was their most shared tweet in the dataset we examined.\n\nAgain, it's not necessarily an approach that everyone can copy, but when you've got the world hanging on your every word, sometimes less is more.\n\nSo what is it about Tesla that has captured the imagination? This is very difficult to put your finger on exactly, but I'd say one element of it is that a lot of people buy into Musk's vision of the future.\n\nWhether it's sleek, environmentally friendly electric cars, smart solar panels, smart batteries, or private space exploration, it's a vision that people want to follow, or at the very least know more about.\n\nFrom a social media marketing perspective, it's no surprise then that Tesla is the car brand most linked to topics like electric cars and autonomous vehicles on social, even though established car makers are investing just as much if not significantly more than Tesla in these areas.\n\nThe chart below shows the percentage of the social discussion held by each brand on the subject of electric vehicles:\n\nAnd the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles is? It certainly isn't Tesla. It's actually Renault-Nissan, all the way down in 11th on our list.\n\nTesla and Musk have managed to create a perception of themselves that enables them to compete, and really, outperform auto rivals on social.\n\nIt's difficult in many ways for established players to do what Tesla do in putting a single person front and center of their brand. Brands like BMW, Toyota, and Ford were founded decades ago and not every founder has the charisma and eccentricity of Elon Musk.\n\nBut providing a personalized, insider view on social media can help humanize your brand. Whether it's the CEO, another executive or a group of employees, consumers are increasingly interested in the people and values behind a brand (especially the big ones), not just the products. Musk's - and by proxy, Tesla's - popularity resides in his willingness to share his random thoughts, ideas, and even failures; where other executives, understandably, prefer to play it safe.\n\nThe problem is, social media is now such a noisy landscape that \"playing it safe\" isn't really enough to cut through the background noise. It may be a bit uncomfortable at the beginning, but now is the time for CEOs and executives to start being more visible on social media.\n\nYour customers (and investors) are talking about you anyway, being on social lets you at least play some role in shaping their perception.", "A man who landed on the moon said the billionaire will not be able to make money from commercial spaceflight.\n\nBILLIONAIRE Elon Musk is hoping to make a fortune out of space exploration and his plans to put humans on Mars.\n\nBut a Nasa astronaut who landed a spacecraft on the moon fears he may have bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nCompanies including the likes of Musk's Space X will struggle to make money from his plans to explore Mars - and their founders should leave it to nation states, Al Worden told a crowd at New Scientist Live in London this morning.\n\nThe Space X owner has reportedly sold two tickets to the moon and has made it his mission to put humans on Mars by 2030, believing it will one day become a commercial enterprise as successful as the aviation industry.\n\nBut Worden, the pilot of the Apollo 15 which landed on the moon in 1971, said that Musk will struggle to ever see a \"return on investment\".\n\nHe said: \"I think it's going to be way too expensive.\n\n\"I'm concerned that there is no return on investment outside of the tickets you are going to sell to make the trip.\n\n\"He [Elon] has sold tickets and I have no idea how much he sold them for but I suspect they are very expensive.\"\n\nWorden added that he \"appreciated\" the commercial aspects of spaceflights, and believed they would form a \"bedrock\" for flight in low earth orbit, such as shifting satellites around.\n\nBut when it comes to long flights to Mars, \"I just don't see a profit,\" he said.\n\n\"That's for governments to handle\".\n\nThere has been much debate over the privatisation of space exploration in recent years\n\nSome analysts liken the advent of commercial spaceflight to the dawn of the passenger jet and the golden of aviation which followed the Wright Brother's invention of their flying machine at the turn of the century.\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, the US government began to subsidise pilots and companies so they could sell tickets to the general public, sparking the dawn of the glamorous air hostess, which has since evolved to a less coiffed steward waggling a scratchcard in your face on a Ryanair flight.\n\n\"Back then it was such an oddity, it was a wonderful thing to get a flight,\" Worden recalled.\n\nFollowing the space race of the Cold War era, astronauts have taken on something of a diplomatic role.\n\nSpace has transcended politics, culture and language as nations join forces on the International Space Station.\n\nRussia and America have even agreed to join forces to build a space base orbiting the moon.\n\nBut the station is soon to be sold and commercial space flight the next cosmic epoch.\n\nThat's paved a way for Paypal co-founder Elon Musk, who also created Tesla Motors and is now the chief executive of his own Space X company.\n\nMusk has sparked controversy over methods to create cost-friendly ways to travel through our solar system, including reusable rockets and fuelling while on the launchpad.\n\nUS president Donald Trump has given him an advisory role now that he's pledged to put an American on the moon once again.\n\nBut Worden, who has travelled 400,000km above the Earth, believes going to the moon is simply a \"diversion\".\n\nMany see Elon Musk's Space X as a leader in the space industry, with his focus on making reusable rockets that could help cut costs.\n\nHe already has contracts to transport important satellites into low-earth orbit, although there have been some setbacks already.\n\nThe rocket that was meant to send Mark Zuckerberg's \u00a3150million device into orbit dramatically exploded on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThis week at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia, Musk will take to the stage to reveal his designs for a \"multiplanetary society\".", "Maye Musk, a 69-year-old model, dietician and mother to Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk, is adding another title to her impressive resume: she's now a CoverGirl!\n\nThe cosmetics company announced the ground-breaking news on Wednesday, September 27, and Musk couldn't be more thrilled. \"I'm so excited to say that I'm now officially a CoverGirl! My three kids, ten grandchildren and I have had the hardest time trying to keep it a secret until today's big announcement,\" she said in an Instagram post. \"Who knew, after many years of admiring the gorgeous Covergirl models, that I would be one at 69 years of age? It just shows, never give up. Thank you Covergirl, for including me in your tribe of diversity.\"\n\n\"Maye Musk is not only a timeless beauty, but a visionary who has always followed her own path, creating new opportunities and paving the way for so many others who might not meet the industry standard of 'model,' but are truly beautiful in every regard,\" Ukonwa Ojo, the SVP of CoverGirl, said. \"This is exactly what Covergirl is all about: owning your identity and proudly sharing with the world all the facets that make you, you. Maye is an affirmation of the power and importance of diversity and inclusivity in the world of Beauty. She is unstoppable and, together, we're just getting started!\"\n\nMusk is making history as the oldest CoverGirl the brand has ever had. She joins a slew of inspirational women who have recently been named CoverGirls including Ayesha Curry and Issa Rae. Congratulations, Maye!", "If you told someone in 2010 that Silicon Valley startup Tesla Motors would be making traditional car company CEOs quake in their boots within 5 years, they would think you were either an idiot of possibly a politician. But today, major countries -- like China, India, France, the UK, and California -- are talking about banning all cars with internal combustion engines. [Yes, I know California is not technically a country -- yet.] Now, Silicon Valley has spawned another startup -- Impossible Foods -- that wants to eliminate all animal-based food products by 2035.\n\nThat's just crazy talk, right? Maybe not. Impossible Foods has secured backing from such luminaries as Bill Gates and Google Ventures. Its CEO, Patrick Brown, a Stanford biochemist, announced this week, \"We want to completely replace animals as a food production technology by 2035. We are working on producing all foods that we get from animals.\"\n\n\"No disrespect to vegetarians,\" he adds, \"but the only consumers we really care about are meat consumers. A friend mentioned to me that if you could make a burger that McDonald's would serve instead of a burger from a cow, then that would be the fastest way to solve the problem. It was a throwaway comment, but I realized that was exactly it.\n\n\"And because of my scientific background I knew it was completely doable. I found to my surprise that no one was treating it as a solvable problem. I think people just figured we have this insanely destructive system and it's just never going to go away. They thought, 'bummer, but there you are'.\"\n\nWhat is Impossible Foods' secret? Heme -- a compound that contains iron and is found in animal muscle. Impossible Foods describes it as \"a basic building block of life in all organisms, including plants.\" According to the company, heme is significant because it gives meat its unique color and taste, as well as catalyzing the other flavors in meat when it is cooked.\n\nJust like Tesla, Impossible Foods' main mission is to save the world. Patrick Brown was strongly influenced by a United Nations study published in 2006 which claimed animal farming was responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions worldwide than the entire transportation sector -- that study was actually produced by the agriculture/livestock arm of the UN, so some have claimed it is too industry friendly.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Brown began a quest to address the climate crisis no matter the hurdles. Unlike Musk, Brown is pursuing his dream by making plant-based foods instead of electric cars.\n\nThe company opened a new manufacturing plant in Oakland this month and has started producing one million pounds of plant-based \"beef\" every month. It expects to its products to reach 1,000 distribution points by the end of this year. The company's chief communications officer, Rachel Konrad, says, \"We're not a burger company. We're a tech platform for food. Our first product was 'proof of concept'. We can have second, or tenth, products after that.\"\n\nFull disclosure: My bride is attempting to transition our menu at home away from animal products. Much to my surprise, I now prefer a veggie burger or a so-called \"chicken patty\" to the real thing. This is rather surprising from someone who used to get excited by \"all you can eat\" prime rib night at the local eatery. Tastes and attitudes change. Plant-based food today is miles ahead of what it was just a few years ago.\n\nAll the arguments that militate in favor ditching internal combustion engines apply to plant-based food. Try it. You just might like it. I do.\n\nSource: Plant Based Foods", "A man who landed on the moon said the billionaire will not be able to make money from commercial spaceflight.\n\nBILLIONAIRE Elon Musk is hoping to make a fortune out of space exploration and his plans to put humans on Mars.\n\nBut a Nasa astronaut who landed a spacecraft on the moon fears he may have bitten off more than he can chew.\n\nCompanies including the likes of Musk's Space X will struggle to make money from his plans to explore Mars - and their founders should leave it to nation states, Al Worden told a crowd at New Scientist Live in London this morning.\n\nThe Space X owner has reportedly sold two tickets to the moon and has made it his mission to put humans on Mars by 2030, believing it will one day become a commercial enterprise as successful as the aviation industry.\n\nBut Worden, the pilot of the Apollo 15 which landed on the moon in 1971, said that Musk will struggle to ever see a \"return on investment\".\n\nHe said: \"I think it's going to be way too expensive.\n\n\"I'm concerned that there is no return on investment outside of the tickets you are going to sell to make the trip.\n\n\"He [Elon] has sold tickets and I have no idea how much he sold them for but I suspect they are very expensive.\"\n\nWorden added that he \"appreciated\" the commercial aspects of spaceflights, and believed they would form a \"bedrock\" for flight in low earth orbit, such as shifting satellites around.\n\nBut when it comes to long flights to Mars, \"I just don't see a profit,\" he said.\n\n\"That's for governments to handle\".\n\nThere has been much debate over the privatisation of space exploration in recent years\n\nSome analysts liken the advent of commercial spaceflight to the dawn of the passenger jet and the golden of aviation which followed the Wright Brother's invention of their flying machine at the turn of the century.\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1930s, the US government began to subsidise pilots and companies so they could sell tickets to the general public, sparking the dawn of the glamorous air hostess, which has since evolved to a less coiffed steward waggling a scratchcard in your face on a Ryanair flight.\n\n\"Back then it was such an oddity, it was a wonderful thing to get a flight,\" Worden recalled.\n\nFollowing the space race of the Cold War era, astronauts have taken on something of a diplomatic role.\n\nSpace has transcended politics, culture and language as nations join forces on the International Space Station.\n\nRussia and America have even agreed to join forces to build a space base orbiting the moon.\n\nBut the station is soon to be sold and commercial space flight the next cosmic epoch.\n\nThat's paved a way for Paypal co-founder Elon Musk, who also created Tesla Motors and is now the chief executive of his own Space X company.\n\nMusk has sparked controversy over methods to create cost-friendly ways to travel through our solar system, including reusable rockets and fuelling while on the launchpad.\n\nUS president Donald Trump has given him an advisory role now that he's pledged to put an American on the moon once again.\n\nBut Worden, who has travelled 400,000km above the Earth, believes going to the moon is simply a \"diversion\".\n\nMany see Elon Musk's Space X as a leader in the space industry, with his focus on making reusable rockets that could help cut costs.\n\nHe already has contracts to transport important satellites into low-earth orbit, although there have been some setbacks already.\n\nThe rocket that was meant to send Mark Zuckerberg's \u00a3150million device into orbit dramatically exploded on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThis week at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia, Musk will take to the stage to reveal his designs for a \"multiplanetary society\".", "1,000-Horsepower Cadillac CTS-V Runs A Tesla Model S P100D Ludicrous: Video\n\nThis video deserves a Michael Buffer-style fight announcement: \"Let's get ready to rumble!\"\n\nIn the right lane, we have a second-gen Cadillac CTS-V coupe with a built LSX and a massive blower under the hood, good for 850 horsepower at the wheels on E85 fuel.

Company founder James Dyson claims the project has been in the works for two years, and already has 400 workers dedicated to it.\n\nWhat's more, Dyson is opting not to partner with a traditional OEM. Instead, Dyson has pledged to invest \u00a32 billion ($2.69 billion) toward the all-electric car.\n\nElon Musk Has Twitter Spat With Mercedes' Parent Company Over EV Investment\n\nElon Musk has long been vocal of his desire for more players in the EV market, claiming it aligns with Tesla's mission to \"accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\" But Sunday, his want of competition sparked a bit of controversy on Twitter.\n\nThe tech mogul replied to a tweet from USA TODAY about Mercedes-Benz's $1-billon investment to produce its all-electric SUV in Alabama, and suggested that figure had one too few zeros for \"a giant like Daimler/Mercedes.\" His post caught Daimler's eye, prompting the German company to send him a link to an announcement it made last year.\n\nDaimler's statement from 2016 outlined its $10 billion investment -- the exact sum Musk wanted -- to establish its EQ (Electric Intelligence) sub-brand.\n\nHyundai Gives Hurricane Harvey Hero Car To Celebrate Three-Millionth Elantra Sold In US\n\nSome automakers commemorate milestones simply by distributing press releases -- but not Hyundai.\n\nThe Korean manufacturer recently sold its three-millionth Elantra in the United States, and celebrated by gifting one to Hurricane Harvey first responder Henry Rogers.\n\nRogers is a paramedic field supervisor for Acadian Ambulance, and worked non-stop for 48 hours helping residents of the Houston area during Harvey, reportedly saving multiple people's lives.

The car itself may be considered an ugly duckling by some but that was not the main reason why it didn't sell in record-breaking numbers, most people were interested in decent electric range.\n\nThe idea behind the BMW i3 was to create a city car and therefore it didn't need a lot of range from the get go. However, people still freak out whenever they get inside a car and see an estimated range of just about 100 miles and that has a lot to do with the way we've been getting used to exploiting our cars, knowing that we can get 200 miles more out of it by simply stopping by a petrol station for a couple of minutes. While BMW officials might've been asked about the size of the i3 battery a number of times before, a clear answer was still not offered.\n\nDuring the Frankfurt Motor Show though, talking to CAR magazine, we finally got a rather clear answer and it may be surprising to a couple of people. It turns out BMW decided to go with the battery the i3 was originally fitted with due to the CO2 footprint the car would've had otherwise. \"The basic idea, at least from the BMW Group perspective, is to lower our CO2 footprint - that's the real reason we do it. When we introduced the i3 with the smaller battery, it beat every single gasoline car by up to 50% in terms of CO2 footprint,\" said Dick Arnold, head of product management at BMW i.\n\n\"Offering a huge battery with the tech available when we introduced the i3, there was no freaking way that you could have improved your footprint - you could even increase it. The new battery means it's actually possible now to decrease and improve your CO2 footprint with bigger batteries, as seen in the Vision car,\" he added. Therefore, while back in 2013 a bigger range wasn't possible without affecting the overall CO2 footprint, that did change over the following years and the future i models will surely show it.\n\nAnd among those future models we'll also get to see the iNext in production clothes. The car will be electric and will feature the latest technology in autonomous driving, hopefully including Level 5 autonomous driving which means you won't have to touch any of the controls once inside it. Sure, there's still a long way to go but once this happens, all future BMW cars will change, hopefully for the better.", "The 69-year-old model also happens to be the mom of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk .\n\nMusk, who is believed to be the oldest ever spokeswoman for CoverGirl, is the latest example of the beauty company's push into diversity.

Rick Snyder can't attend every ribbon-cutting invitation he gets, he made sure he showed up at Move Systems International's ceremony this week.\n\nWhy? Because he said the small, West Michigan business ticked off all the boxes.\n\nThe food cart maker is innovative, eco-friendly, high-tech, employs a percentage of veterans and provides space for high school students to learn about the skilled trades.\n\n\"This is a true Michigan success story. It brings together so many elements of what we are doing so well,\" Snyder said Wednesday, Sept. 27, in front of the business, located in the Grand Rapids suburb of Walker.\n\nCEO James Meeks, 35, couldn't be a better poster boy for the state. The decorated U.S. Army veteran and Ivy League grad is returning to Michigan after his parents left Ann Arbor when he was a kid.\n\n\"They thought there were no more opportunities in Michigan,\" Meeks said of the family's relocation to the East Coast in the 1990s. \"It took me a quarter century in order to get back. I couldn't do it without all the people who were trying to help us.\"\n\nThe way Meeks tells it, everyone went out of his or her way to set him up for success.\n\nTesla Motors' Michigan factory sold for $9.5M\n\nIt began with U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, introducing him to the Michigan Economic Development Corp. The state agency then connected with The Right Place in Grand Rapids. That led to an investment from Amway heir Rick DeVos' Wakestream Venture, a venture capital fund looking for innovative entrepreneurs like Meeks.\n\nHe was introduced to Start Garden, also founded by DeVos, which matched him with vendors and suppliers to set up his \"complicated business model\" in West Michigan.\n\nMeeks decided to partner with DeWys Manufacturing, a 20-year-old metal sheet fabricator at 3691 Northridge Drive in Walker, where the food carts are now made.\n\nLast month, the New York-based Move Systems announced plans to invest $13.3 million in the Walker facility, creating 27 jobs. The state kicked in a $200,000 performance-based grant.\n\nUnlike traditional food carts, Move's eco-friendly version uses solar roof, propane gas and lithium battery instead of noisy generators. The interiors are outfitted with a refrigerator, grill, sink, steam table, double-basket fryer and counter space for serving and food prep. The starting price is $60,000.\n\nThe company's food carts are used by 65 different restaurants in New York to feed about 50,000 people on the streets of Manhattan.\n\nMeeks sees potential for their use in Michigan such as pulling up to factories to feed workers at lunch time.\n\n\"We think we can make the most capital efficient distribution of getting these type of restaurants to people for their food deserts or the middle of New York City, and everywhere in between,\" Meeks said.\n\nOn the employee front, the business is also impressive to the governor.\n\nThe company is doing its part to prepare workers for the future. Last year, the firm partnered with Kenowa Hills Public Schools to open a STEM Academy in a 3,500-square-feet space at the Walker facility. There, students learn about the trades with hands-on curriculum focused on science, technology, engineering and math.\n\n\"We worked with the Department of Education and they worked with us on ways we could do the school,\" Meeks said.\n\nThe company goes out of its way to recruit veterans. Half of Move's management team and one-third of the firm's production workers served in the military.\n\nMeeks, a former U.S. Army combat veteran who received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star, did two combat tours in Iraq between earning degrees from Harvard and Stanford.\n\n\"For me to come back to Michigan is a dream and there is nowhere else where you can build a company like this,\" Meeks said.\n\nWhile the company maintains its headquarters in New York City, Meeks is again living in Michigan after his wife landed a job with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids. The couple have two young children.\n\nSnyder calls Meeks a \"fabulous illustration\" of Michigan's rebound.\n\n\"Jim's story sends a great message about what we can do in Michigan,\" Snyder said. \"For the last six years, we have been the No. 1 state in the country for the creation of manufacturing jobs because that is who we are. We make things. We make the best products in the world right here in Michigan.\"", "Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't give special treatment to family members.\n\nMaye Musk, the latest CoverGirl model and mother of Elon, told the New York Times that she's still waiting for the Model 3.\n\n\"I haven't gotten the 3 yet. I'm at around 300,000,\" she told the NYT. \"Even though I have good connections, I can't jump the line.\"\n\nThe Model 3 is Tesla's first mass-market sedan and the wait for the vehicle stretches at least a year-and-a-half for those who order today.\n\nTesla plans to start producing 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in December, so Maye Musk is likely looking at a 2018 delivery time, though she may get it earlier if she ordered a Premium trim.\n\nMaye Musk isn't the only relative to get denied special treatment. Lyndon Rive, the former CEO of SolarCity and Musk's cousin, once asked Elon Musk for a \"family member discount\" for a Model S.\n\n\"I asked, 'Elon, hey can I have a family discount' and his answer is, 'Yeah absolutely. Go to TeslaMotor.com, buy the car online, and the price you see there is the family discount,'\" Rive told Business Insider. \"Everyone gets a family discount.\"\n\nRive said he and his wife still own a Model S and Model X.\n\n\"I give Elon credit beyond the fact of being the best entrepreneur in the world -- he treats everyone the same. Everyone. There's no nepotism at all,\" Rive said.", "With the mission to expand its Supercharger stations worldwide, Tesla is currently in action by commencing the construction of several stations in China -- including the largest one in the world.\n\nThe world's largest Tesla Supercharger station is currently under construction in China. The country is definitely an optimal location due to the fact that the Chinese market is the largest auto market in the whole world.\n\nThe electric automaker has announced plans of installing 10,000 Supercharger stations all over the world with 1,000 stations allocated to China alone. Currently, Tesla (Nasdaq:TSLA) owns and operates 951 Supercharger stations worldwide with 6,550 Superchargers.\n\nOne Supercharger station is set to have 50 Superchargers installed, thus making it the world's largest. Previously, California was set to have the largest Tesla charging stations with 2 stations of 40 Superchargers each being constructed. However, the recent reports show that the record is now beaten. According to Electrek, the world's largest and most extensive station is currently being constructed underground at the Lilacs International Commercial Centre in the Pudong district of Shanghai. It requires a massive amount of power supply in order to simultaneously charge 50 electric vehicles. The whole station could potentially have a power output of over 3 megawatts.\n\nIn 2016, Tesla tripled its sales in China to $1 billion despite experiencing a rough start. The revenue from the country represents 14% of Tesla's total revenue for that year. Over 11,000 vehicles were delivered last year and the business continued to thrive during the first quarter of 2017.\n\nIn recent news, China reportedly plans on relaxing its policies with regards to foreign automakers planning to manufacture in the country. Despite the possibility of allowing them to build a manufacturing site in the country without a local partner, the automakers will still be charged a 25% import tariff on their products if sold.\n\nThere is no confirmation yet as to whether Tesla will execute its proposed plan of attaching convenience stores beside its stations. However, if the plan pushes through, Tesla's business is set to flourish as the company will have a win-win situation.\n\nSupercharger stations being planted all over the world promote accessibility that could boost the sales of Tesla. The accessibility of charging stations globally could encourage more consumers to buy electric as recharging becomes easier. In line with this, the world's growing awareness of the environmental problems we are currently facing could result in the promotion of battery-powered vehicles and the eventual banning of gas-powered ones. As of now, the future is looking bright for Tesla.", "ChargePoint has announced a new feature that allows electric vehicle (EV) owners to charge their car using near-field communication (NFC) and their smartphone.\n\nThis doesn't mean your phone itself is capable of charging your car of course, though that would be fantastic. Instead, the company -- which operates one of the largest EV charging networks in the world -- has today lifted the lid on \"tap to charge\" which lets drivers initiate the charging process at 40,000 spots across North America by simply tapping their Android, iPhone, or Apple watch at the charging terminal.\n\nPrior to now, drivers could launch a charging session by tapping the RFID card they received when they signed up to the ChargePoint network, or by pressing a button within the ChargePoint mobile app. Using tap to charge, however, means that drivers no longer have to pull a card out or open an app -- it's just \"tap\" and go.\n\nFounded out of California in 2007, ChargePoint is better known in its domestic U.S. market, but it also has a presence in Australia. The company also recently closed a $125 million funding round to push into Europe, taking its total equity financing to nearly $300 million.\n\nThe global EV market share is still relatively modest compared to petrol and diesel, but it is growing fast with Europe representing the second biggest market for EVs globally after China -- helped by incentives such as tax reductions and exemptions. Volvo recently committed to make only electric and hybrid cars from 2019, while Uber, too, has pledged to make all UberX cars in London electric or hybrid by 2019, though the company has bigger fish to fry in the U.K. capital just now.\n\nThe new NFC charging integration only applies to the U.S. for now but as more public charging stations arrive in Europe -- something that will be ramped up \"dramatically\" in 2018, according to ChargePoint, we will likely see this land in other markets too.\n\nIn the U.S., fully electric car sales are reportedly up around 47 percent so far in 2017, with Tesla's mass-market Model 3 Sedan doing its bit to drive EV sales. Earlier this month, Tesla revealed it was bringing its supercharging network to city centers in addition to highways.\n\nIt's clear that EVs -- whether hybrid or fully-electric -- are on an upwards trajectory, so it's little surprise to see incremental improvements continue to roll out to the charging infrastructure that will power the industry's onward journey.\n\n\"ChargePoint is committed to getting every driver behind the wheel of an EV, and a major part of achieving that goal is making it as easy as possible for drivers to charge,\" explained ChargePoint's CMO Colleen Jansen, in a press release. \"Tap to charge delivers on that commitment and fosters EV adoption by providing the easiest way for drivers to charge wherever they live, work and play. The ownership experience is key to broader EV adoption, and trailblazing features like tap to charge make fueling your EV much more simple and convenient than the gas vehicle it likely replaced.\"\n\nTap to charge works on NFC-enabled phones running Android 4.4 or higher, iPhone 6 or higher, and Apple Watch. iPhone users need to create a ChargePoint Pass by hitting \"Add Pass to Apple Wallet\" in the ChargePoint app, then position their finger on Touch ID and tap the phone on the station to start charging. Apple Watch wearers, on the other hand, need to double-click the side button and hold the watch near the contactless reader on the charging station.", "In pre-market trading, Tesla's shares were 0.8% lower at US$338.40.

But not as much as you might think.\n\nIn the cases made for and against trade action under the Section 201 process currently underway, both sides have argued that their position is good for the U.S. solar industry, and employment - even as the bulk of the public statements by U.S. solar companies have been against trade action.\n\nHowever, the stock market has also spoken, with last Friday's injury determination not exactly inspiring confidence in investors. Following the ruling, stock prices were down across a range of solar exchange traded funds (ETFs), manufacturers and installers who are exposed to the U.S. market.\n\nSpecifically, the Guggenheim Solar ETF (NASDAQ: TAN) took a sharp downward turn on Friday, as did the stock of First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), SunPower (SPWR), Tesla (TSLA), Sunrun (RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE: VSLR)\n\nThis is not to say that the market is all-knowing, or that individual investors even understand the details of the Section 201 process and potential market impacts. First Solar's stock price decline is particularly ironic, given that its thin-film PV products are not covered under the Section 201 case, and that if anything trade action will increase the demand for its products in the U.S. market.\n\nLikewise Canadian Solar's stock did not show this same sharp decline, even though the company is exposed to the U.S. market both through the sale of modules and its ownership of developer Recurrent Energy. And while the big three solar installers - Tesla, Sunrun and Vivint - all saw their stock prices fall (although Tesla's began the day before the ruling), the U.S. residential sector is likely to be less effected by any trade action than the commercial and industrial or utility-scale markets.\n\nIn fact, the indiscriminate market response to the ruling is reminiscent on a smaller scale of what happened to solar stocks in the first half of 2016, when stock prices plunged along with oil prices, due to a faulty association made by many investors between the price of oil and the competitiveness of solar. This may be a holdover from the 1970s when petroleum made up a significant portion of U.S. electricity generation.\n\nIt is also important to note that the stock price declines that began on Friday are relatively small compared to the widespread gains in solar stocks over the last six months. The fall in TAN's price was only 4% from Friday through Tuesday, compared to a nearly 20% gain from early May through mid-September.\n\nBy Wednesday TAN's price had made up for half of the losses.", "In pre-market trading, Tesla's shares were 0.8% lower at US$338.40.

Carlsson said, \"We will produce a battery with significantly lower carbon footprint than the current supply chains.\"\n\nThe $4.5 billion Northvolt factory in Sweden will pump out batteries for electric cars, ships, trucks, and snowmobiles. They'll source materials like nickel and graphite from Swedish deposits, and cobalt from a Finland refiner. They'll power the factory with renewable energy from Sweden's hydropower dams. They'll reuse waste heat and recycle old batteries. Northvolt just this week announced a \"wide-ranging supply and technology partnership\" with company ABB.\n\nRelated: Tesla executives start mysterious new recycling company\n\nNorthvolt batteries will have an almost zero carbon footprint, according to Carlsson.

They'll also create their own anode and cathode chemical mixes rather than purchasing them from Asian or European manufacturers.\n\nIs Northvolt making a run for Tesla's business?

I said to myself, \"If the stock doubles, I'll sell.\" Not long after I made my investment, the Tesla Model S shocked the world when it became Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year in 2013, and the stock shot up so quickly that I didn't have time to sell at double my purchase price. I ended up unloading my shares for about $85 each.\n\nToday, Tesla stock is worth more than $370 per share. To say that I sold too soon would be an understatement.\n\nI learned the hard way that instead of setting a specific price target, it's far more important to ask yourself whether your reasons for initially buying the stock still apply, and if they do, whether the current share price is justified.\n\nIn the case of my Tesla investment, not only did my initial reasons for buying still apply (game-changing automotive technology), but the company had gone from a niche player with the Tesla Roadster to a viable mass-market electric car manufacturer. Not only was the higher share price justified, but due to the success of the newly released Model S, the company's future looked brighter than ever.\n\nPrice targets can be a useful tool in the context of \"I think Company X is really worth $50 per share, but it's trading for only $30.\" But the reasons for selling a stock should go far beyond the movement in its share price.\n\nMatthew Frankel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

We did report not that long ago that Tesla was apparently shifting towards use of AMD tech with its self-driving systems and away from Nvidia tech.\n\nThat being the case, presumably, there has been some sort of falling out that has occurred -- whether for reasons of technological capacity, supply limitations, or politics of various kinds.\n\nReuters provides more: \"Tesla's Model 3 and new versions of its other cars will get the new Intel processing modules, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Tesla and Intel declined to comment and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem too likely that we are going to ever get a clear answer on the reason for the change, but it makes for an interesting question.\n\nIn related news, see:\n\nTesla Reportedly Working With AMD On Self-Driving AI Chip\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk: It Only Took 6 Months To Recreate Mobileye Chip Tech (#ElonTalks)\n\nIntel & Waymo Collaborated On Compute Platform Design For Self-Driving Cars", "The line to purchase a new Tesla Model 3 is long. On July 28, the first recipients of the vehicle -- Tesla employees or those with close connections to the company -- were handed the key(card)s to their new cars. But over 400,000 people have signed up to buy a Model 3, and the wait to receive one of Tesla's $35,000 electric cars, billed as the carmaker's first mass-market vehicle, is now expected to stretch 12 to 18 months.\n\nFamilial connections are allegedly not enough to jump the line. In a Sept. 27 interview with The New York Times, Maye Musk, CoverGirl's most recent model and 69-year-old mother of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, reported that she had not received any special treatment.\"I haven't gotten the 3 yet,\" she said. \"I'm at around 300,000 [on the waiting list]. Even though I have good connections, I can't jump the line.\"\n\nThe company has been slowly ramping up Model 3 production from the 30 vehicles delivered in July to try to meet the predicted 1,500 total deliveries for the third quarter. Musk has said the company's production will follow an S-curve with a slow build up, and rapid acceleration until plateauing at about 33,000 cars per month by 2018.\n\nNo modern car company has ever pulled off such a feat, especially one without experience manufacturing at scale. Tesla's latest model, simpler and less luxurious than its premium predecessors,has a 220-mile range, five-seats, and can hit 131 miles per hour, and costs around the same as the median US car price. To get there, Tesla is skipping many of the incremental steps used by established carmakers when launching new products. Instead of testing relatively cheap, prototype manufacturing tools before replacing them with more pricey equipment, Tesla is moving straight to the permanent tooling.\n\nTesla runs the risk that something in the production process goes awry and triggers expensive recalls or delays for the 500,000 cars or so Tesla expects to produce each year. That's a scenario that could jeopardize the company's future. If so, a wait time of just 18 months will, in retrospect, sound great.\n\nRead full story", "Equities research analysts forecast that Tesla Inc.

The plans to launch Tesla Model 3 in India seems to have been pushed back lack of policy clarity and is now expected to be launched much later. Globally, Tesla started the deliveries of Model 3 in June earlier this year from its Fremont factory located east of San Francisco and has committed to manufacture 500,000 units of Model 3 every year. Elon Musk has also went on a public platform to say that Tesla can deliver about 20,000 units Model 3 cars every month from December 2017. However, Elon Musk or the Indian government still cannot commit on the timelines for the Tesla Model 3 to launch in India. In more than one occasion, Musk has confirmed that Tesla will come to India with its Model 3 and things looked very positive when PM Modi took a tour of Tesla's headquarter in October 2015. With some initial glitch and improper clarity on import duty structure and policies on Make-In-India, the talks are now gaining positive momentum again as a TOI reports now suggests that Tesla has now initiated talks with the Government to enter India through the single-brand retail route, which includes mandates like sourcing 30% of components locally.It is not a viable option for Tesla to bring the Model 3 as a completely built unit (CBU) as by doing so the import duty will go up by over 110% and it will become too expensive to then sell them in India.\n\nDeveloping charging infrastructure is another hurdle the company will have to cross.In all possibility, the first Tesla car to come to India will be the Tesla Model 3 is a five-seater sedan and is powered by a 50 kWh and a 70 kWh battery pack, depending on variant.

This time it's Amazon HQ2, dangling 50,000 jobs and a supposed $5 billion in spending on construction and operations in front of the city who will give them what they want.\n\nPredictably, Gov. Sandoval and his economic development minions are scurrying around, frantically designing a desirable incentive package to lure this \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity to Nevada. We'll be competing with other locales desperate for jobs and private sector growth by responding to a request for proposal (RFP) issued by Amazon to determine who will offer them the most upfront cash and goods.\n\nSo what does Amazon want for the privilege of becoming their HQ2 hometown? In their RFP, they talk about sustainability, connectivity and a cultural community fit. They also are looking for a quality workforce, access to an international airport and a major highway corridor, and \"a community where our employees will enjoy living, recreational opportunities, educational opportunities, and an overall high quality of life.\" But mostly they care about the money.\n\nAmazon's \"high-priority considerations\" revolve around incentives to \"offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs.\" Competitors must provide a highly detailed description of each type of incentive they are prepared to offer, how long it will last and the amount. The company emphasizes that incentives such as land, tax credits/exemptions, relocation grants, workforce grants, utility incentives/grants, permitting, and fee reductions are all welcome, stating \"the initial cost and ongoing cost of doing business are critical decision drivers.\"\n\nAmazon is not the least bit subtle in suggesting communities pursue special incentive legislation to compete for their business, but it's clear they're not going to be patient about waiting for local or state political bodies to act. They indicate they may select more than one proposal and pursue further negotiations, or perhaps they won't pick any proposal at all, if their demands aren't adequately met. It seems they've learned a lot from Tesla's billion dollar shakedown of Nevada's legislators a few years ago.\n\nAmid paragraph after paragraph of potential incentives, Amazon also asks communities to comment on their recreational opportunities, crime rates and affordable housing. They want to know about education attainment, existing wage rates and traffic congestion.\n\nOne would think Northern Nevada would automatically be eliminated based on the lack of affordable housing alone as the Tesla effect continues to exacerbate the extreme housing shortage for those making 80 percent or less of the area median income. The chronic choking traffic and overcrowded low-performing schools in Las Vegas would seem to rule out the southern end of the state as well. The negative effects of granting millions and billions of tax incentives to Tesla, Apple, Switch and other corporations are all too obvious as Nevada's local and state governments continue to struggle to provide basic services.\n\nWouldn't it be refreshing if Nevada refused to participate in bidding wars with other communities that don't have our low taxes, high quality of life, and rich natural resources to meet the demands of corporations looking to enrich themselves further at the expense of everyone else? Every time we pay out billions of dollars in tax giveaways to attract growth, each and every one of us pays the price in overcrowded schools and roads, spiking rent and real estate to unsustainable levels, resulting in increased community stressors as more people, especially seniors on fixed incomes, become homeless or unable to maintain their quality of life.\n\nInstead, let's welcome Amazon HQ2 to set up shop on our terms. Pay your fair share in taxes, guarantee a living wage for all workers, not just the few at the top, and show us a thoughtful plan for good corporate citizenship. Then we'll decide if your company deserves Nevada instead of the other way around.", "AutoReportNG:\n\nThe great push to upgrade to more electric vehicle (EV) friendly infrastructure is underway. A set of photographs obtained by Electrek show an enormous Tesla Supercharger station being built underground at the Lilacs International Commercial Centre in the Pudong district of Shanghai. The station will house 50 Superchargers, making it the largest known Supercharger station in the world.\n\nTesla has previously announced a goal of installing 10,000 Superchargers around the world, with 1,000 planned for China alone. Additionally, the company recently announced plans to introduce smaller Superchargers to cities to help expand the ease of owning a Tesla.The expansion of Supercharger accessibility is one of the key factors in allowing Tesla's influence to spread across the car buying world. As using and recharging electric vehicles becomes easier, it will also become easier for consumers to buy into the technology. Tesla is working to expand accessibility by making their cars (relatively) more affordable, like with their Model 3 offering.\n\nMore accessibility will help to expand EV adoption. And while Tesla vehicles are not currently capable of truly driverless operation, improving autonomous capabilities is one of the company's major goals. The combination of the added safety of autonomous driving and environmental consciousness will help to usher in a new era in personal transportation.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.autoreportng.com/2017/09/china-is-getting-largest-tesla.html\n\nLalasticlala\n\nMynd44\n\nIshilove\n\nMarpol\n\nSeun", "AMD is now making custom AI processors for Tesla, and now it seems NVIDIA is losing another piece of the electric car makers' pie, with Intel taking over the infotainment systems according to sources of Bloomberg.\n\nWhat makes this news even more interesting is that Tesla, NVIDIA, and Intel have declined to comment.

Buoyed by the immense popularity of the Model S and later the Model X, not to mention unexpectedly high demand for the Model 3, Tesla has morphed into a legitimate auto industry player. What's more, and all the more impressive, is that Tesla's success has had a huge impact on the entire industry, prompting many established players such as Porsche and Mercedes to devote billions of dollars towards EV development.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla's future looks remarkably bright, its issues regarding autonomous driving notwithstanding. Not only is demand for the Model 3 through the roof, but Tesla over the next few years plans to expand its vehicle lineup with the addition of a semi-truck, a revamped Roadster, a pickup truck, and a crossover version of the Model 3 dubbed the Model Y. That said, a recent research note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas claims that the cumulative number of Tesla vehicles on the road may reach 32 million over the next two decades.\n\nIn a note obtained by Electrek, Jonas articulates that Tesla's on-road fleet of vehicles will grow from 300,000 by the end of this year to 531,000 by the end of next year. Beyond that, Jonas' projections grow even bolder.\n\n\"By early 2023, we forecast Tesla's car population to have multiplied 10x compared to year-end 2017,\" Jonas writes. \"Looking a bit further out to 2040, we forecast the total number of Tesla vehicles in use (including Tesla Mobility and Tesla Consumer and net of scrappage) to be nearly 32 million units, or 107x higher than the 2017 level.\"\n\nTruth be told, it's hard to take projections two decades out all that seriously. If anything, it remains to be seen if Tesla can even meet its overly ambitious goal of increasing production to 500,000 units by the end of 2018. Even if we assume that Tesla can meet its manufacturing goal, the automotive landscape is changing faster today than it has in decades. Consequently, predicting what the industry will look like in 5 years, let alone 23, is challenging enough. To help illustrate all that can happen in just five years, consider this: five years ago, the Tesla Model S was barely three months old.\n\nAll told, the next few years will be incredibly interesting to observe. Not only will we see Tesla roll out a handful of new vehicles, it remains to be seen if they can ramp up production as promised. What's more, Tesla over the next few years will face increased competition from sophisticated industry players like Porsche. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that no one over the past few years has made any money betting against Elon Musk.", "For $35,000, you could buy 100 shares of the stock or a new Model 3. How to choose.\n\nAt its current price of $341 per share, a 100-share block of Tesla costs just about $35,000. Interestingly, that's the same price you'd pay for Tesla's new Model 3 electric sedan.\n\nTesla shares, of course, keep getting more expensive. They're up 64% over the last year. The Model 3, however, marks an important milestone in the opposite direction -- you can now buy a Tesla for half the price of what you would have paid a year ago.\n\nThe affordable Tesla is the main driver of the company's latest rally, but before you get behind the wheels of the car or the stock, it's important to understand what Tesla has on its plate. The company has set an ambitious target to produce 500,000 cars in 2018 and has fallen short of promises in the past.

How to choose.", "If Elon Musk's master plan goes according to plan, the world will soon be saturated with millions of Model 3 units driving around with or without their drivers. Until recently, however, such a scenario seemed to be limited to the future, due to Tesla's notorious reputation for delaying the deliveries of its vehicles.\n\nDuring the official delivery event of the first production-grade units of the Tesla Model 3, CEO Elon Musk admitted that the carmaker would be experiencing its own version of manufacturing hell. Considering that Musk is aiming to produce 1,000 Model 3 cars by the end of September and 20,000 vehicles monthly by the end of 2017, the reservations about the mass-market EV's delivery timeline are entirely understandable.\n\nAccording to a Tesla enthusiast and SpaceX employee, however, the Model 3's production seems to be going very well. So well, in fact, that the delivery of a Model 3 unit that was originally scheduled for October-December 2017 was bumped up to the end of September, according to a CleanTechnica report.\n\nAnnouncing the update on the Tesla Model 3 Owners Club forums, the SpaceX employee stated that he recently received a call from the EV maker stating that the tentative delivery for his ordered vehicle had been changed. This timeline, of course, is quite surprising, especially considering Tesla's reputation for its deliveries.\n\nIf the SpaceX employee's Model 3 does get delivered by the end of September, it would mean that the mass-market EV's production schedule is actually moving around one to three months ahead of schedule. This is unprecedented in Tesla's short tenure in the automotive industry, especially since the Model 3 is the carmaker's first attempt at manufacturing such a massive number of vehicles simultaneously.\n\nPrevious Tesla vehicles like the Model S and Model X have experienced delays during their respective delivery timelines, with the latter being infamous for being delivered to customers months later than originally scheduled. With the Model 3, however, Tesla seemed to have learned its lesson well, and it is approaching the manufacturing process of the vehicle from another angle.\n\nDo you think the Tesla Model 3 delivery timeline is realistic? How likely will the vehicle be delivered to customers earlier than expected? Sound off in the comments below!\n\n[Featured Image by Tesla]\n\nSimon Alvarez"], "2017-09-29": ["But Tesla's 11 patent applications filed between May and September might offer some insight.\n\nThe patents included safety mechanisms, communication redundancies and a replacement technique for lithium-ion batteries; weight-supporting structures, fluid-directing valves, auto-configured seat belts, air conditioning vents and traction control systems for Tesla's all-wheel-drive electric vehicles; and a heat-recovering industrial oven for materials treatment.\n\nAs Baird Equity Research points out, the applications are heavily focused on energy safety and efficiency, primarily for automotive development.\n\nUpon approval, these patents should insulate Tesla from rivals and help the firm remain an industry leader.\n\n\"We believe superior manufacturing and differentiated technology should give TSLA a competitive advantage over the long term,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a Friday note. (See Kallo's track record here.)\n\nBaird anticipates continued innovation from Tesla in gigafactory, solar and other technology that will merit additional patent filings.", "Model X deliveries surprisingly declined on a sequential basis in Tesla's second quarter. Can deliveries of the electric SUV return to growth?\n\nIn electric-car maker Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) second quarter, both Model S and Model X sales fell sequentially. A pullback in quarterly Model S deliveries wasn't particularly surprising, as the model is more than three years older than the Model X. But the pullback in Tesla's Model X deliveries was unexpected.\n\nHave Tesla's quarterly Model X deliveries peaked? Based on a look at some recent comments from Tesla and the company's recent transparency about order trends for the electric SUV, Model X sales should return to growth in Q3.\n\nTesla started delivering its Model X in September 2015. After a slow start in the first few quarters of availability, production and deliveries soared. And by the fourth quarter of 2016, quarterly Model X deliveries were only a few thousand units behind Model S deliveries.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2017, Tesla's quarterly Model X deliveries hit a record high of 11,550, up 381% year over year and 21% sequentially. But Model X deliveries pulled back meaningfully in Tesla's second quarter when the company said it delivered about 10,000 units, down 13% sequentially.\n\nTesla blamed the pullback in Model X deliveries during the quarter on a production shortfall of 100 kilowatt-hour battery packs and a decision to add new Model X units to its fleet of service loaners and to its stores.\n\nDespite how significant Tesla's pullback in Model X deliveries was in Q2, Model X deliveries could jump meaningfully higher in the second half of the year.\n\nSure, solving its 100 kWh battery production constraint toward the end of its second quarter should play a role in helping Model X production and deliveries pick back up. But there's also good reason to believe growing demand could play a role, too.\n\nHaving more Model X display and test-drive units at stores could drive demand during the quarter. Before the company sent these Model X, its stores were \"operating with far short of what was needed and, in some cases, none at all,\" Tesla said in its second-quarter update on vehicle deliveries. Test drives have always played a significant role in the electric-car maker's demand generation. Investors shouldn't underestimate the important role having enough test-drive and display vehicles can have on demand -- particularly for a unique vehicle like the Model X with its falcon wing doors.\n\nAnother potential catalyst for Model X deliveries during its third quarter could be Tesla's move to lower the price of the base version of its Model X.\n\nFortunately, Tesla has also given investors a straightforward look at how demand is faring for the vehicle. In its second-quarter shareholder letter, Tesla said orders for the Model X were increasing leading up to and after the company's July 28 Model 3 handover event. Further, Tesla said that toward the end of Q2 its weekly net order rate for Model S and Model X were 15% higher than the average weekly order rate for the two vehicles during the quarter -- a trend that may have been helped by Tesla's decision to send more test-drive and display units to stores.\n\nWhile Model S sales may have trouble growing meaningfully in the second half of the year, Tesla seems particularly bullish on the Model X. \"There appears to be substantial untapped sales potential for Model X,\" Tesla said in its second-quarter update on vehicle deliveries.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I believe Tesla could report Model X deliveries between 11,000 and 12,000 units for its third quarter -- about in line with the record Model X deliveries the company reported in Q1.\n\nTesla is slated to report its vehicle deliveries within three days of its third-quarter end, or anytime between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3.", "Daniel Tonkopiy was in Las Vegas in recent days for the Interbike International Expo to give the world the first major unveiling of his company's new electric bike, which sports a top range of 236 miles. To put that feat in perspective, Tesla's base trim Model 3 has a range of 220 miles.\n\nTonkopiy -- the CEO of Ukraine-based Delfast -- says that max range helps ebikes start to become something more than what they have been until now. With ranges of, say, 40 to 50 miles, they're little more than \"a toy,\" as he puts it, and \"not very useful.\"\n\n\"Imagine a car that could only go 40 or 50 miles,\" he says. \"You'd never be able to be far from a gas station.\n\n\"We have many plans. We're going to open a sales office in California. I'm a fan of electric transportation, and I think this is the future of transportation.\"\n\nThe public apparently thinks so, too. His company is currently running a Kickstarter to raise $50,000 for production of the bikes -- and they've already blown past that goal, raising almost $90,000 with still more than a month to go in the campaign.\n\nDelfast's ebike lineup includes three models, with the \"Prime\" model -- weighing 95 pounds with a top speed of 34 miles per hour -- being the model the company says has a range of 236 miles. To showcase that range, the company strapped a GoPro on a rider's head, produced a time-lapsed video of the footage and uploaded it to YouTube:\n\nAmong the bike's other features are high-intensity headlights, front and rear turn signals and automatic brake lights; GPS tracking; a mobile app; a start/stop button; remote start; 2 USB chargers; a U.S.-made 3,000-cycle battery; and more.\n\nDelfast's other two ebike models include a \"Top\" and \"Lite\" version. The former has a range of 174 miles, while the latter sports a 112-mile max range.\n\nTonkopiy's product was part of a busy three-day Interbike showcase in Vegas, which drew about 25,000 attendees. About 50 companies presented at this year's show, up almost tenfold over the past five years, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The show also included things like a 1,500-foot test track sponsored by Bosch that dealers were able to use to try almost 200 ebike models.\n\nEbikes, to be sure, still represent only a fraction of the total number of bikes sold in the U.S. each year. The newspaper cites a stat from Electric Bike Association executive director Ray Verhelst that says somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 ebikes are sold in the U.S. annually.\n\nThat's compared to about 15 million bikes total sold each year. Verhelst also says it's not the younger, early adopter set that's typically the biggest buyer of ebikes. That title belongs to the 55-to-65 age group, he says, according to the paper.\n\nThat works just fine for the Delfast bikes, though. \"Our electric bikes are not an abstract dream or concept,\" the company announces on its Kickstarter page to potential funders. \"It's the real-deal, hardcore electric bike project that's available for use regardless of gender and age ... It's not necessary to be in excellent physical shape to travel long distances on an electric bicycle - along with Delfast bikes it's possible to easily and comfortably cover 236 miles on a single charge.\"\n\nTonkopiy says Delfast started three years ago as a delivery service company, \"delivering goods from online stores in one hour on electric bikes.\" (\"Delivery Fast,\" which got shortened to the company's name.)\n\n\"We started buying Chinese bikes, but they had a very small range of, like, 20 miles per charge. Then we started to combine them with additional batteries. We had a lot of experiments.\n\n\"We want to conquer the world with this bike. Our goal is to spread the word, to make people know about such great products. And I really consider this a great product.\"", "By Matt D'Angelo Posted on September 29, 2017\n\nElon Musk announced that Tesla is well on its way to completing the world's largest lithium ion battery in Jamestown, Australia, at a Powerpack event held at Noeon Hornsdale wind farm on September 29.\n\nAfter just two months of construction, the facility is already operating at a 50 MW level. The world's largest battery is expected to be fully operational in December 2017. Tesla said in a statement that the company partnered with Neoen, a renewable energy provider, and will complete the world's largest battery pack within the next 100 days.\n\n\"Tesla was selected from over 90 competitive bids to provide the entire energy storage component of a 100 MW/129 MWh Powerpack System to be paired with global renewable energy provider Neoen's Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown, South Australia. The interconnection agreement has been approved by AEMO and has just been signed this afternoon by Electranet. Tesla and Neoen now have 100 days to complete the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world.\" read the press release from Tesla.\n\nOnce fully operational, Musk said the plant will deliver 100 MW of energy to Southern Australia. In addition to the Powerpack opening event, Tesla also posted a time lapse of the construction of the facility on Instagram.\n\nOn schedule to complete the largest lithium-ion battery system in the world in December\n\nA post shared by Tesla (@teslamotors) on Sep 29, 2017 at 2:46am PDT\n\nFor Musk, who earlier in the day presented his vision for SpaceX-built Martian cities at IAC2017 in Australia, the world's largest battery project is a precursor to what is expected to be the future of battery-powered energy sources.\n\n\"What this serves as is a great example for the rest of the world of what can be done,\" Musk said. \"So when this is done, which will be in just a few months, it will be the largest battery installation, by an estimated power factor of three, in the world.\"\n\nThe Powerpack opening event was powered entirely by the Powerpack system, giving attendees a taste of what was possible.\n\n\"Talk is cheap, action is difficult. And the reason we worked as hard as we possibly could and got as much done as possible was to show that it's not just talk it's reality,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Everything you see here, this whole event, everything, is powered by those packs,\" he said, pointing out the window at the battery facility. \"There are no generators, this is all coming from that system over there.\"\n\nTesla's 100 MW/129 MWh Powerpack system dubbed as the 'World's largest battery' in Jamestown, Australia\n\nThe world's largest battery was constructed after sweeping blackouts across Southern Australia.

Brown, who enacted legislation earlier this month threatening to withhold rebates on electric vehicles unless their manufacturers can be certified \"as being fair and responsible in the treatment of their workers.\"\n\nThat could be a considerable threat, since Tesla customers this year have been collecting almost $1 million a month from the state in rebates on the automaker's luxury Models S and X, at a rate of $2,500 per car. The claims are certain to rise in coming years as Tesla ramps up production of its mass-market Model 3, which just began coming off the assembly line.\n\nThe new law has stirred editorialists across the state, who have come down heavily on Tesla's side. \"Outrageous groveling to unions,\" groused the San Jose Mercury; \"a thinly veiled threat against an employer of thousands of Californians\" was the description offered by the San Francisco Chronicle. (These clips were brought to my attention by Tesla, as an indication of its opinion of the legislation.) The Times editorial board hasn't spoken on the issue.\n\nThe legislation applies not only to Tesla, which is aiming to mass-manufacture cars in California, but to all automakers whose vehicles are eligible for state rebates. That includes Nissan, Toyota, GM, Ford, BMW and lesser-known companies such as Bluecar and BYD.\n\nThe rebate program has been a boon for the electric carmakers, whose customers have collected nearly $449 million in state rebates since the program began in March 2010. About $140 million has been appropriated in the current fiscal year for the rebates, which are entirely funded from cap-and-trade program revenues; an allocation for the next fiscal year hasn't yet been made. Significantly fewer rebates have been doled out his year -- $60.3 million through Sept. 28, compared with $71 million in the same period in 2016 -- but that's mostly because the state imposed income limits in mid-2016 so the rebates wouldn't go strictly to wealthy buyers. That may have hurt Tesla, a luxury brand that accounted for more than 21% of all rebate dollars last year, but only about 12.4% so far in 2017.\n\nStill, it appears that the state's shot was aimed chiefly at Tesla. The language was inspired by the California Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the UAW, which in turn is engaged in a ferocious unionization battle with Musk and Tesla.\n\n\"The big picture for us is that the auto manufacturing industry created at least two generations of middle-class families,\" Angie Wei, chief of staff of the labor federation, told me. \"Now, not only are we replacing combustion-engine cars, but we're incentivizing it with public money. The question is whether that's going to duplicate the middle-class life that was created for so many families.\"\n\nThe unions say that won't happen at the wage rates and working conditions typical in the electric vehicle industry. Tesla's own figures put average annual hourly pay for Fremont workers who started in January 2013 at about $39,000, or a bit less than $19 an hour. \"No one can survive in California on that,\" says Wei, \"especially in the Bay Area.\" The corresponding hourly wage at General Motors, by Tesla's reckoning, is nearly $24.\n\nMusk acknowledged in an email to Tesla employees that cash compensation at Tesla, healthcare and other benefits have run well behind those of GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. He argued that the difference was more than balanced by Tesla workers' access to stock grants. By their nature, however, the value of those grants is conditional -- as J.P. Morgan once said, stocks \"fluctuate.\" Unless Tesla is guaranteeing its shares' value to employees, stock grants aren't the equivalent of hourly cash pay. It's true that over the last four years, the shares have gained nearly 90%, but there have been periods in that span when it's taken a tumble, too.\n\nWorkers who moved to Tesla from NUMMI, the joint Toyota-GM automaker that built the Fremont plant before shutting down in 2010, may feel the pinch especially acutely. Tesla production worker Hai Nguyen, 38, says he earned $32 an hour at NUMMI, where he worked for nine years. Now he collects $18 an hour at Tesla, where he's been employed for just over four and a half years performing roughly similar work. He says he received options on 60 shares of Tesla stock when he joined, but had to sell them to make ends meet when they vested four years later. Subsequent option bonuses, he says, are at the discretion of supervisors. Nguyen is involved in the UAW organizing campaign.\n\nTesla has mounted an aggressive anti-labor campaign that has resulted in a formal accusation of unfair labor practices lodged in August by the National Labor Relations Board. A hearing is scheduled to begin in Oakland on Nov. 14. Among the allegations is that Tesla supervisors and security guards have improperly interfered with union leafletting.\n\nThe NLRB also indicated it regards the confidentiality agreement employees are required to sign as overly restrictive. The agreement states that \"everything you work on, learn about or observe in your work about Tesla is confidential,\" including information about other employees, and warns that \"it is never OK to communicate with the media or someone closely related to te media about Tesla\" without permission. The board has regarded some such agreements as violations of federal labor law, and it's prevailed in federal court. Tesla called the NLRB filing \"baseless\" and \"entirely without merit.\"\n\nMusk's own comments about the union drive also have a retrograde tone, not unlike what one might hear from an industrial magnate in the 1890s. Following a post on Medium.com about injuries and poor pay by Tesla worker Jose Moran, Musk accused Moran of being a paid union agitator and painted the UAW as an organization that \"does not share our mission and whose true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.\" The company says it's working to make Fremont \"the safest car factory in the world\" and that its safety record is \"much better than [the] industry average.\"\n\nSome workers question that. Nguyen says the safety culture at Tesla doesn't match NUMMI's, where he says equipment was better maintained and work routines more standardized. \"They don't take safety ss seriously as they say they do,\" he told me. Workers often are loath to complain, because \"there's no job security.\"\n\nThat brings us back to the state's initiative on electric vehicle manufacturers' labor relations. It's unclear how much Tesla or any other companies have to fear from the legislation, which Gov. Brown signed on Sept. 16. The measure expresses the legislature's \"intent\" that the secretary of Labor work with the Air Resources Board to \"develop procedures\" to certify the automakers as \"fair and responsible\" in time for the 2018-2019 rebate year. Labor Secretary David Lanier will start working on that process with \"stakeholders\" -- including organized labor and the manufacturers -- in coming months, according to his spokesman. Prospective buyers, who are the direct beneficiaries of the rebates, also can be expected to weigh in.\n\nThe process, in other words, is wide open. \"We're all trying to figure out how this will play out,\" says Chuck Colgan, a spokesman for the Center for Sustainable Energy, a nonprofit that runs the rebate program for the state.\n\nThe factors likely to be used to judge a company's employee relations are easy to guess, if not the weight they'll carry. Unresolved NLRB suits or a surfeit of OSHA complaints: bad. Competitive wage rates: good. The rules worked out by the Labor secretary and ARB will probably have to be approved by the legislature, so the industry's lobbying clout also will be stirred into the cauldron.\n\nBut encouraging good labor relations hasn't always been easy for government agencies, especially in recent years when corporate profits have soared and wages have stagnated. Critics of the \"fair and responsible\" rule should explain why it's wrong for California to hold manufacturers using millions of dollars in public funds to pump up their sales to broad standards of behavior. \"We want to make sure,\" Wei says, \"that the public investment California is making creates both cleaner air and good jobs for our economy.\"\n\nKeep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

Yet, still, one of my favorite technologies in modern cars' options list is semi-automatic parking assist. The smartest of today's cars can basically park themselves at the touch of a button.\n\nIn addition to just making life easier for lazy automotive journalists, parking assist systems make parking faster, more accurate and safer for everyone. However, these systems come at many different levels of sophistication and not all are created equally. To make your life easier, I've put together a guide to the different types of parking assistance tech and what we look for when deciding on our favorites.\n\nPassive parking tech\n\nAt the most basic level, parking assist technology is any device or feature that boosts the convenience and safety of parking your car. This could include passive systems like the rear camera that boosts visibility when reversing or the guidance lines on the camera's feed that help to plot a course around obstructions.\n\nEven more useful are proximity or parking-distance sensors that silently scan the area around the car and notify the driver when approaching an obstruction. These systems are especially useful because their audible alerts don't require the driver's full visual attention, you can keep looking around. However, the inclusion of a visual indicator on the dashboard (like those on BMW or Audi's parking distance sensors) further boosts the ease of squeezing into very tight spots.\n\nMost proximity detection systems use ultrasonic sensors that can double as rear cross-traffic alert systems that detect oncoming vehicles when reversing out of a parking spot or even for blind spot monitoring on the highway. The most advanced of these features can even automatically apply the brakes when the sensors detect you're about to back into a wall or pedestrian or move into the path of a collision. I'm not a huge fan of auto-braking as false-positives can be jarring, but for inexperienced or inattentive drivers it's better to be safe and mildly annoyed than sorry.\n\nWhat you want to look for is a system that gives you a lot of information about the area around your car without returning a lot of false positives. Generally, sonar is better than camera-based at avoiding hitting objects, especially at night or in the rain when camera visibility suffers, but cameras are better at avoiding curbs, which ultrasonic sensors usually miss. If possible, get both: I like the BMW Park Distance Control's sort of proximity heat map that works well with its 360-degree camera system. I also like Audi's Parking System Plus for its ability to customize the volume and tone of the audible distance alerts, which some may find annoying.\n\nActive parking tech\n\nThose same ultrasonic sensors are part of the requirement for the current cutting-edge of active parking technology: semi-autonomous parking or, as it's sometime known, parking with steering assist. As the name would indicate, these technologies feature computer aided steering, so the other requirement would be an electric power steering system (EPS).\n\nHere's how it most often works. When the active parking system is activated, ultrasonic sensors at the front and rear corners of the car activate to scan the roadside, detecting parked vehicles and the spaces between them and measuring those spaces.\n\nBy default, most systems scan the passenger side of the car where you're most likely to be parallel parking, but you can specify the direction of scanning by using the appropriate turn signal. You can also usually choose between parallel parking on the street and perpendicular parking in a parking lot on newer cars. The method differs from make to make, but most often it's toggled by tapping the parking assist button.\n\nOnce the car passes a space where the car will fit with a reasonable margin, it will alert you to first stop and shift into reverse. At this point, you should have a look and make sure that the spot is clear and legal. Current parking systems can't see driveways, fire hydrants, no parking signs or red-painted curbs, so if the space isn't legit keep on moving and the system will keep scanning.\n\nIf the space is legit, let go of the steering wheel and the car's computers will take over the electric power steering, turning the wheel for you and guiding the vehicle into the space. You, the human in the seat, retain control of the pedals and will need to ease off of the brakes in order for the car to move. The system may also call upon you to shift between drive and reverse gears, if corrections are needed for perfect parking.\n\nAt any point, you can grab the steering wheel to cancel the steering assistance and immediately regain control of the car, which is why it's important to actually let go of the wheel during auto-parking -- if the car feels your hand on the wheel, it may (and probably will) cancel the assistance, leaving you to complete the maneuver yourself.\n\nAnd since semi-auto parking can get cars into really tight spots -- or perhaps the cars around you have changed position while you were away -- the best systems will also feature an inverse feature called park-out assist. This feature will take control of the steering wheel while the driver shifts between forward and reverse, shuffling the car out of close quarters. Once the path is clear, the system will disable assist and leave you free to go.\n\nI find that letting the computer do the parking is helpful in a variety of ways even for experienced drivers. For starters, it's often faster, more precise and certainly more convenient. The ability to automatically measure potential parking spaces alone makes semi-autonomous parking assist worth the cost of admission for larger vehicles and SUVs. It also totally removes the learning curve for unfamiliar vehicles and drivers, so you can lend your car to a family member and not have to worry about it returning with curbed wheels or dinged bumpers.\n\nWhat you want to look for is simplicity of operation. Auto-parking systems have been around since 1999, but they were complicated and it wasn't until 2009 that we started seeing systems with the holy grail of single-button operation. Look for one of those single button systems like Ford/Lincoln's Active Park Assist, FCA's ParkSense, Volkswagen's Park Assist or Toyota's Intelligent Park Assist. Many automakers also call their proximity sensors \"park assist\" as well, so make sure you're getting the one that steers. While you're at it, double check that your make and model also supports some sort of park-out assist to get you out of tight spots.\n\nRemote parking tech\n\nSo far, the common thread of all parking tech is that a human actually needs to be in the driver's seat while parking the car. However, that may not always be the case with the cutting edge of parking technology: remote parking.\n\nRemote parking systems let drivers get out of the car and send their car to a parking space or summon it when it's time to drive. This could be as short a distance as a few feet to send the car into a tight space where the doors would be blocked for entering or exiting or as far as summoning the car from a remote garage on your property to pick you up at the front door. At this high level of tech, there are three tiers of functionality.\n\nThe first is basically remote control. You line the car up with the space, get out and hold a button on the key fob or smartphone app to send the car into the space. Take your finger off of the button and the car stops moving. On the surface, it's fairly simple.\n\nTesla's Autopilot Summon feature on the Model S and Model X are examples of this remote technology, as are BMW's Remote Parking feature on the latest 5 and 7 Series sedans. I should note that remote parking of any sort is not yet street legal in the U.S., so you'll be limited to using the technology on your own personal property, which is why Mercedes-Benz doesn't offer the functionality on its North American models.\n\nTech tier two is what's called trained parking, which I've seen demonstrated by the Volkswagen Group and automotive supplier Continental. You must first \"teach\" the car a route -- say, from your garage, along your driveway and to your doorstep -- by manually driving it yourself. While being \"trained\" the car will be gathering information about the path via GPS and sensors located around its perimeter -- either cameras, ultrasonic sensors or both. With the path memorized, you can then exit the vehicle at either end of the path and send it away or call for it later via key fob or smartphone app. Each time the system runs the route, it reactivates the sensors to monitor for new obstructions, people or pets in its path and to learn more about its environment and should grow more accurate in its path-finding.\n\nThe final frontier, as it were, is truly autonomous parking. With a system like this, a driver would be able to just tell the car to go park and it would handle automatically locate a spot and get into it with no training or driver input necessary. You'd be able to drive your car to the airport at the beginning of your vacation and send it home to park in your own garage, rather than paying the pricey long-term lot rates. Likewise, a fully autonomous car would need to be able to find its way back to the driver, wherever they may be.\n\nHowever, with fully-autonomous driving still some ways down the road, it'll be some time before we see a truly self-parking car.\n\nTags Auto Tech", "After South Australia experienced a major blackout recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly proposed that his company could install an energy storage system to solve the problem, and that if the system wasn't installed within 100 days of signing a grid connection agreement, he was willing to do the job for free.\n\nJust such a grid connection agreement was signed on Friday, according to company execs, setting the stage for Tesla's promised 100-days-or-its-free installation blitz to become a reality.\n\nTesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?\n\n-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017\n\nSo, as it now stands, if Elon Musk's tweet is to be believed, the state of South Australia (which has an exceptionally high percentage of wind and solar energy) will have a functioning 129 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery facility within 100 days ... or the project will be completely free.\n\nThis news follows Tesla winning a bid to develop the 129 MWh facility back in July, but, again, the grid connection agreement was just signed today.\n\nElectricity demand in South Australia peaks during the summer, which is in December, so the state's aim is for the facility to be up and running before then -- so as to avoid last year's electricity supply problems.\n\nAs implied above, since the bid was won back in July, Tesla actually began construction on the project a while back -- with the project now approximately half complete, reportedly.\n\nAt an event highlighting the passing of the 50% complete mark, Elon Musk stated: \"This is just the beginning. What this serves as is a great example of what can be done.\"\n\nReuters provides more: \"Musk was speaking from the construction site of the battery, which is being built at a wind farm operated by France's Neoen that is located about 225 km (141 miles) from the South Australian capital of Adelaide and will supply power to the lithium-ion storage cells.\"\n\nHere's more from the Reuters coverage: \"South Australia hopes the Tesla battery will forestall further blackouts, but Australia's Treasurer Scott Morrison says it is just a 'Hollywood solution' that is not solving the bigger problem of how to supply power when the wind isn't blowing.\n\n\"'The batteries are on track to be operational by December 1,' South Australia Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis told Reuters. ... The battery has been designed to help cover temporary dips in wind power, say for 15 minutes, or help control frequency on the grid at times when natural gas-fired plants are unable to help balance generation and power demand.\"\n\nIt looks as if there are still naysayers despite Tesla's clear popularity and success to date. Tesla's Musk isn't phased and expects the project to deliver an important part of the grid solution needed in South Australia. He also revealed that if the company failed to deliver on time, it would cost the company more than $50 million.\n\nMusk Praises South Australia's \"Gumption\" For Commissioning World's Largest Battery Storage Plant\n\nTesla To Install World's Largest Grid-Scale Battery In South Australia", "More than a week after Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico with Category 4-strength winds, many of the island's 3.4 million residents remain without water or electricity, while gas and cash are in short supply as well. At least 16 people were killed by the hurricane, but the number is likely to rise.\n\nThe military, various federal agencies, and disaster relief organizations are working to evacuate residents, distribute aid and repair damaged power grids in Puerto Rico. But private U.S. companies, including Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley powerhouses, are also stepping up to offer support and crucial services.\n\nHere's how some of the tech industry's biggest players are responding to the ongoing crisis in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria:\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said this week that Facebook is donating $1.5 million to recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, with the money to be split between the World Food Program and Net Hope, a consortium representing dozens of nonprofits and tech companies.\n\nFacebook also sent a \"connectivity team\" to Puerto Rico with emergency telecommunications support after the hurricane knocked out most of the island's communications. The majority of the island's cell towers remain out of service. (Several big telecom companies, including AT&T, are also pitching in by sending equipment and engineers to help reestablish Puerto Rico's communications network.)\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk personally donated $250,000 to relief efforts in Puerto Rico, but his company also started sending hundreds of Tesla's Powerwall battery systems after Hurricane Maria passed. Tesla also sent employees to assist in installing the battery systems, which store solar energy and can be paired with solar panels.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.\n\nMicrosoft said this week that the company is donating more than $1 million to Puerto Rico relief efforts through Microsoft Philanthropies, including cash grants and employee matching funds, while also offering technology and services to support relief workers. The company is also providing free Skype calls into Puerto Rico.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple announced that the tech giant's \"community\" (which includes the company's employees as well as customers who donate directly through the Apple App Store and iTunes) has provided more than $13 million to hurricane relief efforts in the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean, including over $1 million for Puerto Rico.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said this week that the company and its employees are offering $1 million in donations to relief organizations, including the Red Cross and UNICEF, to aid recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe room-sharing startup has been working to provide housing for thousands of people who have been displaced by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and now Maria over the past month. Airbnb's website offers options for users in need of shelter in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, while also providing ways for people with available housing to offer space to those who have been displaced.", "Easy Going: We Drove A 2018 Cadillac CT6 With The 'Super Cruise' Hands-Free Driving System\n\nCadillac's bills its brand-new Super Cruise feature as the \"world's first true hands-free driving system for the freeway\" - a claim with which Tesla Motors and its semi-autonomous Autpilot system might take umbrage, having beat Cadillac's system to market by nearly three years.\n\nStill, Super Cruise - which is already en route to Cadillac dealers across the country in some 2018 CT6 Premium Luxury models and all Platinum examples - puts GM's luxury brand on a short list of marques that have taken the plunge by offering futuristic, intelligent automated driving systems today. And with all the negative press attention paid to Joshua Brown's high-profile fatal crash in a Tesla Model S operating in Autopilot mode, delaying the launch of Super Cruise so that engineers could exhaustively vet the system and all but guarantee the utmost safety was a prudent choice.\n\nGM's emphatic focus on safety is apparent from even the briefest of glances at the equipment list. Cadillac's Super Cruise system incorporates a driver attention system consisting of a pair of infrared lights in the upper portion of the steering wheel, and an eye-tracking camera hidden at the base of the gauge cluster. The system has the task of verifying that at all times during Super Cruise's operation, the driver is watching the road for changing conditions, ready to resume control if required.\n\nRemarkably, it even works through sunglasses. Poker game just let out? Go ahead and keep wearing those shades; Super Cruise will know whether you're looking at the road or not.\n\nThe focus on safety is further evident in the relatively narrow scope of the Cadillac Super Cruise system; this is not some overly-feature-rich, quasi-autonomous driving mode ostensibly capable of taking you from Point A to Point B with little or no input. Rather, it's effectively more of an extension of Cadillac's existing adaptive cruise control system, capable of not only accelerating and decelerating with no human intervention, but also of automatically keeping the car centered in its lane and following the curves in the road.\n\nSuper Cruise is only available to use on limited-access freeways - those with on/off ramps and sufficient separation from oncoming traffic - in the United States and Canada. It can't change lanes at the flick of the turn indicator stalk, nor will it automatically head toward the desired exit if you've got a destination entered on the CUE satellite navigation system. In an age where many consumers are still plenty apprehensive about ever riding in a fully-autonomous vehicle, the relatively narrow range of operation and the safeguards against misuse are comforting.\n\nThe real question is: Given that narrow range of operation, is Super Cruise worth the $5,000 it costs as an option on the $66,290 Cadillac CT6 Premium Luxury sedan? That's what we set out to discover.\n\nWe tried out Cadillac's all-new Super Cruise system in a 2018 CT6 Platinum, on a drive from Washington, D.C. to Cleveland, Ohio - a distance of about 370 miles, with an estimated commute time of nearly six-and-a-half hours. The route included portions of the Appalachian Mountain range, which meant plenty of beautiful views along the way - and a world of pain if Super Cruise were to decide to send us off a cliff.\n\nTo initiate the system, one first has to merge onto the freeway and activate adaptive cruise control. Super Cruise will only work at speeds of up to 85 miles per hour, but that's quite all right for folks who've no interest in a count of 15 Over. Once adaptive cruise is activated, the driver must then keep the car centered in its lane, wait for a gray steering wheel icon on the dash that signals the system's availability, and press the correct button on the steering wheel. Easy.\n\nWhen active, the dash icon turns green, as does a light bar along the top of the steering wheel. All you have to do is keep your eyes on the road - or at the least, look out the windshield every few seconds - to keep the system going. The car automatically adheres to the driver's selected cruise speed or maintains the desired distance with the car ahead, whichever limit comes first, and steers itself around bends in the road. At first application, it's a truly eerie experience, watching the wheel wind and unwind with your hands folded in your lap or double-waving at other bewildered motorists; as time goes on, it becomes more routine, and you start to wonder what's with the fixation on this whole \"steering\" thing, anyway.\n\nAnd then you begin feeling free to look around a bit more, taking in some of those stunning Appalachian views. It's quite a nice feature for that.\n\nBut what Cadillac Super Cruise delivers to the driver, more than anything else, is a relaxing, low-fatigue driving experience on long trips. You can't nap, and you shouldn't attempt to catch up on email in between well-timed glances out the windshield, but not having to worry about using the throttle or brakes, shifting, or steering for many miles at a time does wonders to keep one feeling refreshed. Having a massage function on the drivers seat doesn't hurt, either.\n\nCadillac is the right GM brand to debut Super Cruise not only because the premium price tag can more easily swallow the expense of the system, but because Super Cruise is in itself the ultimate luxury; what finer premium creature comfort is there than a system that spares the driver a significant portion of the driving task, delivering a more alert, refreshed human at the end of the trip?\n\nGranted, the system isn't perfect. There were plenty of points along our journey where, even on a limited-access freeway with adaptive cruise control set, the car centered in its lane, the Super Cruise icon simply never appeared. This tended to lead to a period of much head-scratching and resetting of the adaptive cruise control.\n\nWe think this is do to with the integrated camera system. To read the lines in the road and assess the boundaries of the lane, Cadillac Super Cruise uses a front-facing camera, which works quite well in most circumstances - even on busted up pavement. However, we suspect that our pre-production CT6, for whatever reason, may have had difficulty reading the lines while it was being blasted by the sun, or while the trees were casting high-contrast patterns on the pavement with their shadows.\n\nIt's also not infrequent that one will get a sudden, unexpected request from the Cadillac CT6 to take control over from Super Cruise. Notably, this happened to us when a car in the right lane cut quickly in front of us in the middle, without establishing a sufficient gap. The car braked automatically to avoid a collision, while issuing a frantic alert that we needed to resume control.\n\nIt seemed to us like Super Cruise had the incident pretty well covered, but that sort of redundancy is paramount to safety. It's also worth noting that the transition of control from the car to the driver is, in our experience, remarkably smooth and uneventful. We noticed it both when the system asked us to take control, and each and every time we were compelled to manually initiate a lane change to get around a slow-moving commuter. In the latter event, all the driver needs to do is activate the turn signal, and take the wheel; the car recognizes that the driver wants to initiate a maneuver, and puts Super Cruise on standby, the solid green light bar on the steering wheel turning blue while the maneuver is in progress. When you're done, the system is quick to recognize it, and automatically resumes normal operation.\n\nCadillac Super Cruise is smooth, easy, and intuitive to use. Even better, no matter how much pleasure you take in driving yourself, it's a system that you'll use each and every time you get the chance, because it doesn't threaten to take over the fun, pleasurable parts of the driving experience; it tackles only the most hypnotizing, dull, mentally-fatiguing parts of the journey, and even then, only when asked.\n\nThe 2018 Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise is still a far cry from the fully-autonomous, no-human-input-needed vehicles of the future - we're reluctant to even call it \"semi-autonomous,\" preferring to look at Super Cruise as a very advanced active driver assist. But it is a stepping stone, and one that adds value to the driving experience rather than extinguishing it. Moreover, if your initial response to the idea of a machine taking complete control during your commute is one of trepidation, Super Cruise is the perfect antidote.\n\nOn the 2018 Cadillac CT6 Premium Luxury, Super Cruise is $5,000 well spent. The system comes fitted as standard on the range-topping CT6 Platinum.", "Today, China changes the world, a monster markets a minivan, AM radio may vanish, diesels drop for 2018, and we cast a sceptical eye on Tesla's chances of destroying all German luxury brands. All this and more on Green Car Reports.\n\nThe biggest news of the week, and very possibly the year, is the release of China's aggressive new electric-car mandates. This is not hyperbole: They will change the industry forever.\n\nIt seems appropriate that The Two-Headed Monster is helping to market the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan, which runs on electricity, gasoline, or both.\n\nMore than two years ago, we asked why the BMW i3 had no AM radio. Now, we may have more context: analog radio is going away altogether in Europe.\n\nIt's been a tough couple of years for diesel vehicles. Just 12 are now on sale in the U.S. for the 2018 model year, though that number could rise.\n\nWe risk controversy by daring to suggest that the idea Tesla will steamroller German luxury brands is overblown.

Compared to the 33.4 days that conventional cars sit on the market, electric and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles now sell within 24.6 days on average, or 27% faster than gasoline cousins, reports automotive research company iSeeCars.com. The firm analyzed the sales of 2.1 million one- to three-year old cars sold between January and August of 2017 to rank the models.\n\nAlthough EVs accounts for just 1% of total US new car sales, their low price and rising reputation is leading to a brisk business. The used FIAT 500e's was the fastest selling used EV this year, in part due to its low average selling price of $9,055 (down from $21,000 before incentives on the lot). At the other end of the spectrum, the price of a used Tesla Model S rose 3.5% to $67,992 from $70,372 last year.\n\nWhat's driving all this? First, incentives of $7,500 or more on electrics means used EV prices are quite low relative to their new sticker price, and conventional cars more generally. With federal and state tax credits built in, used EVs are even better deals than new models, explains Electrek. Many new EV models are also hitting the market after the expiration of their three-year leases. Buyers now have their pick of low-mileage, luxury cars at low prices built by the likes of BMW and Tesla.\n\nRead full story", "An error has occurred and your email has not been sent.\n\nPlease try again.\n\nNvidia NVDA 1.5710382513661203% NVIDIA Corp.

After stripping out volatile prices for fresh food, inflation was 0.7 percent, the eighth straight month of price rises and in line with market expectations, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said. Excluding fresh food and energy, prices edged up just 0.2 percent compared with a year earlier.\n\nGrowth accelerated in the third quarter to more than 7 percent, with the economy on track to remain among the world's fastest. GDP rose 7.46 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with a revised 6.28 percent in the previous three months, the General Statistics Office said yesterday. The economy expanded 6.41 percent in the nine months through this month, compared with the 6.1 percent that economists estimated.\n\nThe economy grew at an upgraded annual rate of 3.1 percent in the April-to-June quarter, the fastest pace in more than two years. However, growth is expected to slow sharply this quarter in the wake of a string of devastating hurricanes. The expansion in GDP is up slightly from a 3 percent estimate made last month, the Department of Commerce said on Thursday.

Not so hard to imagine, insofar as that's what actually happened.\n\nNow let's imagine I tell you that you, the TTAC reader, can get a discount on an Accord if you use my referral code. That's kind of odd, right? After all, I'm here to report on the Accord, not to incentivize your purchase. Last but not least, let's imagine that for every four Accords sold with my referral code, Honda gives me $6,200 worth of Honda products. A new CBR500, maybe, or an ATV for my son. And let's say that there's actually more to it than that \u00e2\u0080\" in fact, for every four Accords I sell, I can receive up to eleven thousand dollars' worth of goodies.\n\nLast but not least, let's imagine that I hold a significant amount of Honda stock and that my posts are written with the knowledge that positive Honda stories might help that stock move in a direction that is profitable for me.\n\nSounds crazy, right? Welcome to the world of Fred Lambert and his site, electrek.co.\n\nIt's apparently not unusual for Electrek writers to hold positions in Tesla stock, and although they periodically disclose that fact, it's not usually disclosed in close proximity to stories like Tesla Model S Crushes All Competition. What you will find right beneath that article: an invitation to use the writer's code for a Tesla referral. That's where you'll see that the writer has made twenty\u00c2 referrals for new Tesla purchases. And we can also see that Fred Lambert, the site's editor-in-chief and the man responsible for setting the ethical compass of the site, has successfully referred six new owners.\n\nReferrals one and two are worth at least $500 each. Referral three is worth between four and seven thousand dollars on the resale market. Referral four is worth $7,200. That's if you refer new Tesla cars. Referring new Tesla solar will get you $400 in cash, or $750 in credit, per referral.\n\nElectrek's Jameson Dow has twenty referrals. Depending on when he made them, and the conditions of each program, we could be talking about more than sixty thousand dollars in items that can be easily resold for cash. Fred Lambert has six referrals, for a total of ten grand or more. This is all direct from Tesla. We're not talking the kind of paid vacations against which this site has traditionally railed, nor are we talking about freebies like Jonny Lieberman's no-cost year in a $65,000 Cadillac station wagon. We're talking cold hard cash possibilities.\n\nWhen notorious cross-country speeder Alex Roy and a few other autowriters called Lambert out, this was his response:\n\nHe has a point. The breathless, fawning content written by Electrek regarding Tesla is regularly picked up by other outlets. Which helps boost Tesla's stock price, making them money. And the links lead to referrals, which put highly valuable freebies in the hands of Fred and his editorial staff. It's a pyramid of cash that just keeps growing.\n\nShould you care? Only if you are interested in an electric car and want to know the truth about the products. Do you really think that new electric vehicles from Ford, Toyota, and other companies are going to get a fair shake on Electrek when there's a five-or-six-figure incentive for them to keep pushing Tesla? Do you think that Electrek will report fairly and honestly on Tesla's problems when they are holding the stock?\n\nOur readers have often expressed a bit of ennui with TTAC's occasional insistence on showing you how the autojourno sausage is made. But this should make you sit up and pay attention. What's the right thing for Electrek to do? I suggest that they sell their \"gifts\" from Tesla and donate the money to charity. That would be a good start. And it would provide a strong counterpoint to the people who will say that electric auto journalism is nothing but advertorial content under another name. Is it gonna happen? Given that Mr. Lambert has blocked his critics on Twitter and refused to respond to my inquiries, I wouldn't hold my breath.", "The so-called \"moose test,\" a maneuver invented by the people in the Scandinavian Peninsula who were often forced to swerve around the wildlife with little to no warning, has become a widely-accepted challenge for any type of passenger car or SUV 19 photosFor those who aren't familiar with the procedure, the driver needs to simulate an evasive maneuver caused by something that popped unexpectedly on the road. They will swerve to one side and then try to get the vehicle back on its original course.\n\nThere are a few vehicles that have famously failed the test, most notably the Toyota Hilux from two generations ago or the first-gen Dacia/Renault Duster. The former was close to tipping over while the latter made a complete mess of the cones lying on the ground. Others suffered similar faiths, with the first Mercedes-Benz A-Class actually ending up on its back, wheels up.\n\nObviously, if you do it at 100 mph (160 km/h), any car will fail, so the standard procedure is to start at lower speeds and to build it up gradually with each pass until the vehicle can't navigate the course without knocking over any cones.\n\nFor most cars, that usually happens between 70 and 80 km/h (43 and 50 mph), but topping up at lower speeds isn't uncommon. For instance, the Tesla Model X electric SUV with its impressive weight of 5,514 lb (or 2,500 kg) managed to acquaint itself of its duties at up to 70 km/h (43.4 km/h). Beyond that, let's just say you wouldn't want to be one of the cones on the asphalt.\n\nBut how will a sports car fare? Well, the V8-powered Mercedes-AMG GT C roadster remained in control up until 78 km/h (48.5 mph). That's 8 km/h (5 mph) more than the lumbering Tesla SUV, which isn't exactly groundbreaking.\n\nYet wait to see what 2 km/h (1.25 mph) more can do to the roadster's behavior in the test. Pushed to 80 km/h (50 mph), the Mercedes-AMG GT C begins to understeer violently when it was supposed to get back in its lane. The people conducting the test blame it on the condition of the front tires, and a close-up does reveal they've seen better days. Until you notice that car appears to be silver and wonder what the hell is going on.\n\nmercedes-amg gt c mercedes-amg gt Mercedes-AMG moose test Shell Angry at Bans on Fossil Fuel-Burning Cars Because of Course They Are A Simple Guide to the G80 Locking Differential Project CARS 2 - Everything You Need To Know Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

Nonsense\" -- referred to an earlier opinion piece in the British Financial Times (paywalled) which suggested that BMW would go the way of largely defunct Finnish mobile-phone maker Nokia.\n\nCHECK OUT: Tesla expands Supercharger fast-charging sites into cities for Model 3 owners\n\nThe piece countering that argument suggests that the German makers' consistent profits will let them wind down production of diesels as they ramp up electric cars.\n\nIt might have a slightly different cast if it took into account the newly announced and aggressive rules in China for sales of electric cars, at a level that California regulators can only dream of.\n\nWhile battery-electric vehicles emerge best when designed on dedicated platforms with flat battery packs under the floor -- VW Group's MEB architecture is one such -- it's not a given that those must be built on separate production lines.\n\nThe ability of the German makers, or indeed any global car company, to intersperse vehicles carrying not only of different engines but plug-in hybrid variants and battery-electric vehicles too gives them far more flexibility to meet market demands while maintaining profits.\n\nNo question remains that Tesla rocked the industry and changed it permanently. The regulations in China would not likely have come about if Tesla hadn't shown what was possible.\n\nTesla has yet to demonstrate that its Model 3 sales and volumes will turn it profitable at last, though every electric-car advocate and owner likely hopes devoutly that it will.\n\nBut the ability to innovate and make money at the same time is what separates the winners from the losers.\n\nJust ask anyone who remembers the now-defunct British auto industry.", "Musk has started work on his pledge to build the world's largest lithium battery plant for South Australia\n\nTesla's TSLA Ceo has begun work to fulfill his pledge to build the world's largest lithium battery plant for South Australia in 100 days, according to CNBC.

So Tesla's solar customers will be able to give referral codes that work with Tesla's vehicles, and vice versa.\n\nSolarCity has its own referral program, but since that company is now part of Tesla, that referral program is ending now that this new integration has been announced.\n\n30 Tesla's Model X gets artsy Solar benefits\n\nThe benefits for buyers and referrers change based on what's being purchased.

That purchase credit only lasts through October, though, so if you want that benefit, you'll have to place an order before Oct. 31. Free Supercharging will stick around, though.\n\nIf the referrer has one or two referrals, they can choose between a Model S for Kids or a Signature Black WallConnector, the latter of which is matte black and also has Elon's signature on it. A referrer is eligible for a gift for both the first and second referral, so you can get two toy cars, or two WallConnectors, or one of each.\n\nOn the third referral, the referrer can choose between one of two sets of unique Tesla wheels (Arachnid or Turbine design). They can also opt for the \"Week with Model S/X\" gift, which lets the referrer borrow a Model S or Model X for a week to get seat time in something different.\n\nOn the fourth referral, the referrer gets a Founders Series Powerwall 2. On the fifth referral, the referrer receives both an invitation to a Tesla unveiling event and a token for early access to Tesla's Solar Roof products.\n\n75 Tesla Model 3 final production model unveiled\n\nReferrers have to qualify by Oct. 15 to get an invite to Tesla's semi-truck unveiling. After that, it will apply for the next unveiling, although nobody knows what that is.\n\nIt's important to note that Tesla regularly updates its referral program, so what you see above might change in the next several months. It'll likely change to include Model 3 once production expands beyond early employee access.\n\nTags Electric Cars Car Industry", "Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos has been short Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) for quite some time. His conviction hasn't changed despite the stock's strength.\n\nTesla's stock could become a compelling buy once the company is profitable, Chanos said during an interview with Bloomberg TV. The problem is that not only is there no immediate timetable toward profitability. Chanos said; the business model itself is \"structurally unprofitable.\"\n\nThree years ago the narrative surrounding Tesla was that it would be profitable today, he said. But now projections are only calling for the company to be profitable by 2020. In 2019, the timetable for profitability will be pushed out even further, perhaps to 2025.\n\n\"No one is buying Tesla's stock based on its current business,\" Chanos said. \"It's all based on the future.\"\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles toward profitability is that it is \"way too leveraged,\" he said. The company paid $8 billion to acquire its sister company SolarCity through debt and stock issuance, but it ended up with a company with a negative EBITDA.\n\n\"The drain to the shareholders on SolarCity alone is about $1 billion a year -- that's a big drain,\" he said.\n\nTesla's success can be attributed to its founder and CEO's ability to market electric cars as being \"sexy,\" Chanos added.

Elon Musk is also said to have personally donated $250,000 to the relief funds used to send food and supplies to the affected areas. tesla inc Tesla Motors Tesla hurricane hurricane maria Puerto Rico powerwall An Ode to Embracing the Metric System 10 Ways to Make More Money Selling Used Cars Project CARS 2 - Everything You Need To Know Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Tesla's announcement it will indeed sell electric semi-trucks marks another step forward in the company's \"grand vision.\"\n\nThe trucking industry today is \"downright massive,\" as trucks account for 70 percent of the entire country's freight by weight and 82 percent by value, according to Loup Ventures. Trucks consume 54.3 billion gallons of fuel on a yearly basis. And truck drivers are the most common profession in more than half of all states.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that Tesla's entrance into the new market will take many years, Munster cautioned. It is likely that Tesla will target short haul trucks in three years and long haul trucks in five years, Munster said. After five years, Tesla will likely offer a fleet of trucks as a service.\n\nTesla has confirmed an event date for Oct. 26, but details are scarce, Munster said. There's unlikely to be any confirmation on pricing or target dates, but the event could give a better understanding of the long-term opportunity.\n\nWhile Tesla does have a reputation of missing initial delivery targets, entering the truck market has been on the company's \"to-do list since the beginning,\" Munster said.\n\nThe trucking market opportunity is \"ripe for Tesla's taking, considering legacy truck manufacturers' past struggles with innovation,\" he said.", "Sydney - Six months after wagering he can build the world's biggest battery, entrepreneur Elon Musk is back Down Under to defy his doubters.\n\nThe boss of Tesla will descend on South Australia on Friday to unveil progress on a giant battery seen critical to averting crippling power shortages in the state. Musk has promised to have the battery packs in place at a huge wind farm by December 1 - the start of the southern hemisphere summer - to help South Australia avoid a repeat of a state-wide blackout last year.\n\nFor the billionaire, who has a habit of hatching ambitious ideas ranging from an 800-mph solar-powered hyperloop to a space-based Internet, it's not just reputation that's on the line. He's pledged to provide the battery installation in Australia's outback for free if he can't get it working within 100 days of a contract being signed.\n\n\"It is a juggle for Elon, no doubt,\" said Geoff James, research principal for the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney. \"I'm quietly confident this will be the project people look to for battery storage. Co-locating batteries and generation is quite quickly going to become the norm.\"\n\nMusk, who's also chief executive officer of Space Exploration Technologies, unveiled details earlier on Friday of the rocketship the company plans to use for missions to Mars, targeted to start as early as 2022, as well as for travel anywhere on Earth in under an hour.\n\nMultiplanetary species\n\nMusk, 46, who spoke on Friday at the 68th International Astronautical Congress, a gathering of more than 4 000 space enthusiasts in the state capital of Adelaide, gave an update on his plans to \"Make Humans a Multiplanetary Species\". He hinted on Twitter that he'll discuss how to pay for the large rockets and spacecraft that'll be needed to ferry human beings to the red planet.\n\nPrev ideas for paying ~$10B dev cost incl. Kickstarter & collecting underpants, which turned out to be um... less lucrative than expected -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nEarlier this week, Musk posted a simulation on Instagram of how SpaceX's \"Interplanetary Spaceship\" will work and said he'll unveil a new version Friday afternoon.\n\nMusk then travels 241 kilometres north to the Hornsdale Wind Farm for a Tesla Energy event. Under an agreement between French renewable energy company Neoen, Tesla and the South Australian government, the wind farm near Jamestown in the state's north will expand to become the largest generator of renewable energy in the state and be paired with Tesla's planned battery installation.\n\nIn March, Musk said on Twitter that the cost of the battery storage project would be $250 a kilowatt-hour at the pack level, but noted that shipping, taxes, tariffs and installation labour vary by country. The project may cost A$120m, according to a research note from Bloomberg New Energy Finance senior associate Ali Asghar.\n\n\"We caution that a first-of-a-kind project like this could end up costing more than an average project,\" Asghar said.\n\nInvestor confidence\n\nFor South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill, who uses a photo of himself with Musk as his Twitter profile, making sure Tesla delivers is critical to his hopes of keeping the lights on this summer. For Musk, a successful roll-out may build investor confidence and attract more orders from states and nations embarking on a switch to clean energy.\n\nIf it works \"there's 50 other geographies around the world that will want a giant battery,\" said Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian tech billionaire who hatched the 100-days-or-it's-free deal with Musk on social media.\n\nThe stakes could barely be higher for Musk given the sheer scale of the battery, Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian, said in an interview last month.\n\n\"It will be three times bigger than any battery man has ever produced and created,\" he said. \"And it has to be installed by December 1 or it's free. It's going to be a $100m hole in his results if he doesn't. There's a lot of pressure on getting it done.\"\n\nThough Palo Alto, California-based Tesla is best known for making electric cars, the company sells its lithium-ion batteries to utilities eager for cost-effective ways to integrate renewable sources of power like solar and wind into their electric grids. Tesla also acquired solar panel installer SolarCity last November and markets a home battery called the Powerwall to consumers.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.", "Tesla is stepping in to aid Puerto Rico in its recovery from Hurricane Maria by sending hundreds of Powerwall battery systems to the American Commonwealth, whose 3.5 million citizens still do not have access to electricity. Because full power is not expected to be restored for months, the Powerwall energy storage systems, which can be paired with solar panels, could prove to be vital tools as Puerto Rico and its partners work to restore safety and stability to the island.\n\nFirst introduced in 2015, the Powerwall is Tesla's home-based battery system, which is able to store energy captured during the day from solar panels and enables solar energy to be used even at night. Some of the Powerwall battery systems have already arrived in Puerto Rico, with more on the way. Tesla employees are on the island, working to install the systems and additional solar panels and repair existing solar panels. They are also collaborating with local groups to determine the best locations for these battery systems to be implemented. In addition, Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has personally donated $250,000 to the relief efforts in Puerto Rico.\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico electricity crisis sparks interest in renewable energy\n\nPrior to its efforts in Puerto Rico, Tesla had assisted in the evacuation efforts in Florida as Hurricane Irma approached the peninsula. After receiving a request from a Tesla owner who wished to evacuate from their home in Florida, but who was concerned about the car's ability to go the distance, Tesla released a software update which extended battery range. Ultimately, Tesla decided to extend the battery range for all Model S and Model X cars from 60-70 kilowatt hour to 75 kwh.", "Front row left to right: Keith McComsey, director of marketing and customer solutions at Bendix Spicer Foundation Brake (BSFB); Berend Bracht, Bendix's president and CEO; Fred Andersky, director of customer solutions for the controls group at Bendix. Background on stage: Barbara Gould, Bendix's director of communications.\n\nIf there is one lesson the trucking industry should take away from the Tesla car crash last year that occurred when the vehicle was on autopilot, it's that technology itself might not be the issue - it is how technology gets implemented and ultimately used on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThat's the line of thought Fred Andersky, director of customer solutions for the controls group at Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC put forth during a press conference at the North American Commercial Vehicle (NACV) show this week.\n\n\"The Tesla crash shows that it's not the technology that is necessarily the concern; it's the issue of implementing technology,\" he explained.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determined that a truck driver's failure to yield the right of way and a car driver's inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation were the probable cause of the fatal Tesla crash back in May 2016, near Williston, FL.\n\nThe NTSB also determined the operational design of the Tesla's vehicle automation permitted \"over-reliance\" on the automation technology allowing for \"prolonged disengagement\" from the task of driving a vehicle and also enabled the Tesla owner to use the technology in ways \"inconsistent\" with manufacturer guidance and warnings.\n\n\"System safeguards, that should have prevented the Tesla's driver from using the car's automation system on certain roadways, were lacking and the combined effects of human error and the lack of sufficient system safeguards resulted in a fatal collision that should not have happened,\" noted NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt III in a report two weeks ago.\n\nTechnology like Tesla's 'Autopilot' system \"are designed to assist drivers with specific tasks in limited environments,\" he stressed. \"These systems require the driver to pay attention all the time and to be able to take over immediately when something goes wrong.\"\n\nAt the NACV briefing, Andersky noted that \"autonomy encompasses a number of factors, including the appropriate use, understanding, and implementation of the technology, along with the wider impact of the ecosystem surrounding the application.\"\n\nBut he added that development of autonomous technology will continue to be encouraged, especially in cars and especially by government agencies like the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\n\"Their basic role is to reduce crashes and save lives and they see a much bigger fish to fry in terms of autonomous cars versus trucks,\" he added. \"That's why they are more focused on that [car] side. But there is value for truckers here as cars are the ones crashing into them.\"\n\nA University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI study conducted several years ago showed assigned car drivers \"factors of fault\" in 81% of the car-truck crashes studied, compared with 27% of truckers. Those totals were greater than 100%, UMTRI said, because 10% of crashes assigned blame to both car and truck drivers.\n\nAlso from the UMTRI study: Cars were the encroaching vehicle in 89% of head-on crashes; in 88% of opposite-direction sideswipes; in 80% of rear-end crashes and in 72% of same-direction side-swipes, which it said were \"obvious indicators of fault.\"\n\nAndersky also highlighted another key issue where truck technology implementation is concerned: calculating and acting on its benefits.\n\n\"Fleets are really just now starting to understand the safety performance benefits and lower total cost of operations (TCO) possible with new technologies,\" he explained.\n\nFor example, brakes remain the top reason why trucks are placed out of service during the annual 72-hour Roadcheck International safety inspection blitz, representing 26.9 % of all vehicle out-of-service violations. Many of those are due to traditional drum brakes being \"out of adjustment,\" which is a problem that would be solved by switching over to air disc brakes.\n\nYet maximize a return on investment due to the higher cost of air disc brakes versus drum brakes, fleets might want to revisit their highay tractor trade cycles, Andersky explained.\n\n\"They might move from a typical three year trade cycle - which they may use in part to avoid major drum brake work - and expand to a four or five year cycle to gain the full [TCO] benefit of air disc brakes,\" he said.\n\nBerend Bracht, Bendix's president and CEO, noted during the press conference that air disc brakes are a \"building block\" where autonomous vehicles are concerned and will \"likely one day\" be a mandated requirement.\n\nAside from the technology discussion, Bendix highlighted several product enhancements and other endeavors:", "NEW YORK, September 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nAccording to a report by S&P Global Platts and panelists speaking\n\nat this year's Indaba mining conference, battery demand will continue to drive the lithium and cobalt markets for years to come. \"Long-term strong battery demand is very real,\" said Edward Lauer, the head of portfolio optimization at Eurasian Resources Group according to S&P. \"Even if demand from commercial and residential battery storage doesn't materialize to the same extent, consumer electronics and electric vehicle industries will only continue to grow.\" As for the global lithium-ion battery market, Zion Market Research indicates that this market was valued at around USD 31.17 billion in 2016 and is expected to generate revenue of USD 67.70 billion by end of 2022, growing at a CAGR of slightly above 13.70% between 2017 and 2022. First Cobalt Corp. (OTC: FTSSF), Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE: SQM), FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC)\n\nThe S&P report also pointed out the problems the cobalt market is facing. Cobalt mining has under pressure recently from accusations of child labor in mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country which accounts for over half of world supply of the mineral. Andrew Grant of Bloomberg New Energy Finance explained, \"There is more upside risk on battery demand than downside. With big changes expected in the way we use our cars, from self-drive to automation, to the impact of regulation and societal views on the environmental, we forecasts up three million additional electrical vehicle cars by 2025,\" S&P Global Platts reported.\n\nFirst Cobalt Corp. (OTCQB: FTSSF) is also listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol 'FCC'. Yesterday the company reported breaking news that, \"high grade cobalt assays from a sampling program of the historic muck piles from the past producing Bellellen Mine on its Greater Cobalt Project in Ontario, Canada. The program commenced in July 2017 as part of field mapping programs and reconnaissance of new areas with the objective of identifying and prioritizing areas for future exploration and drilling.\n\nDr. Frank Santaguida, Vice President, Exploration commented: \"Bellellen contains a different style of mineralization compared to Keeley-Frontier that at first looked uninteresting but in fact contains high cobalt grades. This suggests that a more complex structural-hydrothermal setting may exist here than was previously considered.\" Trent Mell, President & Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"This is now a high priority target that will require a more detailed drill plan and more initial holes compared to the ongoing drill program at the Keeley and Frontier mines. There are real benefits to sampling mined material previously viewed as waste rock and it has given us quick insight into how to prioritize our drilling.\"\n\nAccording to First Cobalt, \"The diversity of mineralizing textures, the range of high cobalt values also containing silver has made Bellellen a high priority drill target. The weak understanding of the structural controls in this area of the Cobalt Camp requires a detailed drill plan and likely more drill holes than the targets around the Keeley and Frontier mines. A drill permit application has already been submitted.\"\n\nTesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Panasonic Corporation have signed an agreement that lays out their cooperation on the construction of a large-scale battery manufacturing plant in the United States, known as the Gigafactory. According to the agreement, Tesla will prepare, provide and manage the land, buildings and utilities. Panasonic will manufacture and supply cylindrical lithium-ion cells and invest in the associated equipment, machinery, and other manufacturing tools based on their mutual approval. According to a blog from The Tesla Team earlier this year, Tesla and Panasonic begin mass production of lithium-ion battery cells, which will be used in Tesla's energy storage products and Model 3. The high performance cylindrical \"2170 cell\" was jointly designed and engineered by Tesla and Panasonic to offer the best performance at the lowest production cost in an optimal form factor for both electric vehicles and energy products.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine and refining catalysts. Recently, the company announced that it has developed an innovative technology that could enable Albemarle to sustainably increase total lithium production in Chile to as much as 125,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually, without the need for additional brine pumping at the Salar de Atacama. As a result of this development, Albemarle has requested that Chile's Economic Development Agency (Corfo) increase Albemarle's lithium quota. Assuming the technology proves commercially viable, Albemarle plans to build and start-up additional lithium carbonate capacity in Chile in the early 2020s, once current expansion projects are completed and producing at capacity. Projects already underway should increase Albemarle's total annual production capacity in Chile to greater than 80,000 metric tons of LCE by 2020.\n\nSociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE: SQM) is an integrated producer and distributor of lithium, iodine, specialty plant nutrients, potassium-related fertilizers and industrial chemicals. On September 11, 2017, the company announced that the Company and its subsidiary SQM Australia Pty Ltd, have signed a purchase agreement with MH Gold Pty Ltd, Montague Resources Australia Pty Ltd and Kidman Resources Limited to acquire 50% of the assets in the lithium mining project called Mount Holland, located in the State of Western Australia, Australia. Patricio de Solminihac, CEO of SQM, commented: \"We are very pleased to have finalized the documentation required to begin this partnership with Kidman. We are convinced that the capabilities we have developed in over 20 years producing and commercializing lithium products, will be fundamental to successfully develop this project together with our partners.\"\n\nFMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) has served the global agricultural, industrial and consumer markets with innovative solutions, applications and quality products.

Not on Europe's leading low-cost airline it isn't. Ryanair literally ran out of runway on pilot numbers this month, running a very tight roster. It cancelled flights, offered some pilots bonuses to work more hours, apologised, and thought that was that.\n\nBut there is never just one roach in the kitchen. This week, it cancelled even more flights, in total hurting about 400,000 passengers. Customers are mad, the shares are down and regulators have begun to fulminate. Costs will have to rise to pay pilots more, not to mention hiring more of them. Even so, the airline is so far ahead of its competitors in terms of profitability, Ryanair will not suffer unduly. That does not mean it's time to jump on board yet.\n\nOne fast-moving transport theme that has attracted more passengers in the past couple of years is electric vehicles. Nevermind the still-high cost of the batteries, the lack of charging infrastructure and the range anxiety that it causes, change is coming. Britain's answer to Hoover vacuums, James Dyson, has this week announced that his company can clean up in EVs, too. Dyson believes that solid state batteries, as opposed to the liquid ones currently used, will enable it to accelerate to the front of the growing pack of EV makers. Lex wondered whether Dyson's EV will even get out of the lot. Its \u00a32bn plan only equals Tesla's capital spending over the past 12 months.\n\nIf the automotive fleet does go electric, reducing the number of car parts dramatically, what will happen to road side services? Not much, muses Lex. Flat batteries and tyres remain the biggest reasons for calling out companies such as the AA. Not only will drivers still need help with flat tyres, they will also have to buy insurance. It's the law in Britain. AA, which literally had a management bust-up this summer, has moved into writing its own insurance and Lex sees a decent future for the company if it does so.\n\nOf course, if the car market does go electric, oil prices will surely tumble. As yet, traders see no reason to panic. They seem to have interpreted the hawkish tone of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England on interest rates as implied confidence for stronger economic growth to come. Good for all commodities. Oil had trailed the metals price rally, until this summer. In the past three months Brent has rallied 28 per cent. Understandably, the worst performing FTSE listed oil explorers in the first half flipped to becoming the best this quarter. There is a reason for that. Companies such as Tullow Oil and Premier Oil have higher sensitivity to their underlying commodity because of all the debt they accumulated in years past.\n\nA rebound in petrol prices over the past couple of years has not deterred the rapid expansion of food delivery by scooter in the UK and elsewhere. Time-poor, smartphone-enabled diners will happily pay a bit more to have not just pizzas, but kebabs, and fish and chips delivered to their door. In the UK, Just Eat has eaten into Domino Pizza's market share. Deliveroo aims for a slightly classier client, the one that wants finer dining but doesn't want to put on a shirt to go and get it. Still private, Deliveroo raised more money this week. Lex, which does dress for dinner, believes its restaurant delivery service will end up competing for the same mouths as the takeaway apps.\n\nAll the chat about food makes this particular scribe want to rush to his smartphone and order some satisfaction. Before that, though, Lex wishes you a productive weekend of couch-surfing.", "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Edges Toward Trillion-Dollar Market Cap\n\nBloomberg First Word speculated that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) may replace NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) components for its Infotainment. For Intel, it would give the company the positive momentum it needs to crack the automotive market. The big question, though, is why TSLA would make such a move, especially when Nvidia's the favorite supplier for infotainment solutions in cars. Nvidia supplies the two screens-dashboard and console-in Tesla's Model S and Model X.\n\nTesla may have noticed Intel's commitment to supplying computing solutions for automobiles, after the chip giant bought Mobileye. Though the Mobileye unit is not responsible for Infotainment, Tesla may expect it will use more Intel-based solutions. Intel's Infotainment is an embedded version of the i3/i5/i7 CPU. If Intel's performance and price are favorable, Tesla may expand the use of Intel parts in its Tesla 3 and newer models.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2016, relations between TSLA and Mobileye broke down when Mobileye voiced concerns over Tesla's safety for the autopilot feature. Any inclusion of Intel parts now could be a way to rebuild the broken relationship it once had with Mobileye. Working with Mobileye would benefit both companies immensely. Intel paid a huge premium ($15.3 billion) for Mobileye.\n\nHaving Tesla's business would encourage other automakers to strike a deal with the autonomous vehicle technology supplier. Tesla benefits simply from getting access to Mobileye's superior solutions in the ADAS ('Advanced Driver Assistance Systems') space. ADAS is inherently complex, so getting the help of Mobileye's engineers would improve Tesla's ADAS offering.\n\nInvestors should have a favorable view of any supply changes Tesla makes. Tesla may have struck a sweet deal with Intel that would lower costs. Since the company loses money every quarter, keeping a lid on costs will raise the odds that the company reaches profitability earlier than thought. The EV market is becoming increasingly competitive. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are willing to lose money to have a play in the EV market. Dysan is reportedly entering the EV market in 2020. To compete with the bigger players in the long-term, Tesla must cut operating costs as it builds more units.\n\nBears are placing a big bet that Tesla's share price will fall. The short float is 23.6 percent. The stock chart, which does not predict where shares will move next, still shows a \"double top\" pattern at the $380 - $390 a share level. At a recent close of around $341, Tesla could fall while traditional automakers buck the trend. GM is trading at a yearly high while Ford bounced off a yearly low of $10.47 a share reached last month. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (NYSE:FCAU) is up two-fold from a yearly low, although the stock is up on speculation it will receive a buyout offer.\n\nIntel winning business for Tesla is a win-win for both companies. The chip supplier is looking for ways to expand outside of the PC market. For Tesla, switching to a lower-cost supplier will add up. As it prepares for mass production of the Tesla 3, every dollar saved by using another supplier will add to the bottom line.

But to have that done in two months is really incredible,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't remodel your kitchen typically in that period.\"\n\nSouth Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said the project reaffirmed South Australia's standing as the renewable capital of Australia.", "The latest version of Porsche's 2015 Mission E concept is going on sale in 2019. Starting at only $80,000, it is a potential challenger to Tesla's domination of the all electric vehicle market.\n\nThe Mission E looks like a much more modern version of the popular and pricey Porsche Panamera four-door sedan. Standard options include four-wheel drive for those in northern climes and 911-like four-wheel steering. The all-electric Porsche has a total range of 300 miles (500km).\n\nThe car sprints 0-62mph in less than 3.5 seconds, and hits 124mph in 12 seconds. It maxes out at over 155mph.

And now Musk has declared the beginning of the 100 days from Sept. 29, and that they'll be done by Dec. 1, 2017 (even though he's kind of had the green light since March). The project is sitting at 50MW of 100MW.\n\nMusk gave a keynote speech at an entirely Powerpack-fuelled launch at the Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown, three hours' drive from Adelaide on Friday. The event coincided with the signing of an interconnection agreement, now approved by AEMO and just signed by Electranet.\n\n\"Talk is cheap, action is difficult,\" said Musk at the launch.\n\nCompletion of the project, which will allegedly \"stabilise the South Australian grid\" and supply enough power for over 30,000 homes, (about equal to the amount of homes that lost power during the blackout period in Sept. 2016), is set for December, 1, 2017.\n\nAdelaide engineering firm Consolidated Power Projects (CPP) has been contracted to build the Powerpack, so they're under equal pressure.\n\nAlthough the state gets most of its energy from renewables. South Australia's in dire need of a demand-led, renewable energy solution, after the Sept. 2016 blackout that left residents in the dark.\n\nIn March 2017, the State Government announced a plan to create a $150 million fund made to support renewable energy projects. Tesla was selected from over 90 competitive bids to provide the entire energy storage component for Neoen's Hornsdale Wind Farm.\n\nManufactured at the Gigafactory in Nevada, the Powerpack 2, Tesla's second generation Powerpack system, began shipping to customers in September 2016 -- and Australia was one of the first markets to get it.\n\nSo, how does the system work? It's a grid-scale energy storage system, in this instance to be integrated into South Australia's current set-up. Storing excess energy generated by the Hornsdale Wind Farm, the Powerpack 2 will enable the utility to \"firm up renewable generation by reconciling the intermittency of power from these sources and storing excess capacity to dispatch when it's needed,\" according to Tesla.\n\nThe Powerpack acts in an on-demand capacity, deploying power within seconds or milliseconds depending on peak requirement -- distribution like should allow South Australia to avoid future blackouts. Powerpacks can operate as a buffer when the power output from a large generation source is ramping up or down. Impressively, they also consume no water and don't require detailed environmental reviews.\n\nEach Powerpack 2, scalable from 200 kWh to 100+ MWh, is matched with a Tesla inverter, which is, according to Tesla, the lowest cost, highest efficiency and highest power density utility-scale inverter on the market.", "Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, July 19, 2017.\n\nElon Musk's biggest critics argue some of his larger than life ideas may be less than feasible, but on Friday the billionaire put his money where his mouth is.\n\nThe tech mogul started on his promise to build the world's largest lithium ion battery plant for South Australian, in less than 100 days -- or it's free for the state government.\n\nAn agreement between the state of South Australia, Tesla and Neoen, a French wind farm developer, has been signed as of today, meaning, Tesla now has 100 working days to install and get the battery systems up and running. The system would store and intermittently release energy to the the region's electrical infrastructure. The storage could provide electricity to more than 30,000 homes.\n\nPreviously, Musk had said that if Tesla failed to meet the deadline, it could cost $50 million or more.\n\nCNBC attended the \"Powerpack Celebration\" held outside of Jamestown, South Australia to commemorate the start of the contract, where it's worth noting that several of the powerpacks had already been installed and event organizers referred to it as an \"active site\".\n\nTesla was selected out of 90 bids from other companies to provide energy storage.\n\nThe Tesla 100-day challenge originated when Musk promised on Twitter that he could have install the system in a short period of time, after South Australia suffered a state-wide blackout after its renewable energy storage failed.\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla opened a battery storage farm in Southern California, but according to Musk, this project will be three times the size.\n\nThe powerpacks were manufactured in Tesla's new Gigafactory in the Sparks, Nevada.\n\nEarlier in the day Musk spoke for SpaceX at the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia, where he updated his plans send humans to Mars.", "Tesla's Elon Musk for all intents and purposes is the soul of the company.

Take for example Friday, where Musk's latest idea of flying people in rockets from coast to coast is blowing up Twitter. So are his overall views on space travel and the future of his SpaceX creation (he spoke at a space industry conference). Surely, Musk will be tweeting more about space travel and the hyperloop (and God knows what else -- maybe new SolarCity solar panels that help solve world hunger) in the weeks and months to come. That ultimately should remind every Tesla investor of this risk factor buried in the electric car company's annual report:\n\n\"We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Among other commitments, Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles.\" From the outside, Musk looks increasingly stretched at a time in which all his attention should be on making Tesla profitable. He has an obligation to shareholders to deliver (actual results, not just a higher stock price), and whether he is able to fulfill that is a major unknown. It's time he looks in the mirror, acknowledges his true passion (perhaps space travel) and hands the baton off to an outside CEO to run Tesla.\n\nBecause let's face it, Musk hasn't done a good job of building his executive bench.

Earlier this week, Roku had priced its IPO at $14 per share, the high end of its range. At $17.75, the provider of streaming set-tops and HDMI sticks has an official valuation of about $1.7 billion, with that number rising higher after accounting for outstanding stock options and warrants.\n\nWhile the company's debut benefited from investors looking for the next great tech IPO in a year of so few, there is indeed a growth story to Roku explained Chief Financial Officer Steve Louden in an interview with me at the Nasdaq (video below).\n\nFueled by rapid cord-cutting, Roku's revenue rose 25% in 2016 and 23% during the first half of 2017 to $199.7 million. However, hardware sales fell 2% during the latter period to $117.3 million. Revenue growth stemmed entirely from a 91% increase in Roku's higher-margin \"Platform\" revenue. That business, which covers ad sales, software licensing, branded channel buttons on Roku remotes and revenue cuts on subscriptions and on-demand content purchased on Roku devices, increased to $82.4 million.\n\nRoku isn't yet profitable, but has plans to get there quickly via a combination of selling ads on its platform and attracting more overall users, says Louden.\n\nOn a side note, Louden told me people are watching more old episodes of \"Friends\" these days.

Twelve months on, he returned with more detail.\n\nHis BFR, although still massive, is now a little smaller at 106m in height and 9m in width.\n\nThe major difference compared with the original version, however, was cost, the South African-born American said.\n\n\"I think we've figured out how to pay for it. This is very important.\"\n\nThe route to affordability, he explained, was in refocusing all of the company's efforts into the one system - and then using that to meet all its customers' needs.\n\nThis means the BFR would launch satellites and service the space station - as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule do now - but also take people to the Moon and Mars, and do what is termed \"point to point\" travel on Earth where passengers fly, for example, from New York to Shanghai in something like 40 minutes.\n\n\"Some of our customers are conservative and they want to see the BFR fly several times before they're comfortable launching [on it],\" Mr Musk said. \"So what we plan to do is to build ahead and have a stock of Falcon 9 and Dragon vehicles, so that customers can be comfortable if they want to use the old rocket, the old spacecraft - they can do that because we'll have a bunch in stock.\n\n\"But all of our resources will then turn to building BFR.\"\n\nAs well as being the CEO and chief designer at SpaceX, Mr Musk also founded the Tesla electric car company and is chairman of SolarCity which specialises in renewables technologies, such as high-storage batteries.\n\nHe has attracted a rock-star following from fans who love his visionary thinking. And although his promises have often taken much longer to deliver, he has achieved a number of notable firsts.\n\nThese include landing 16 orbital-class rockets back on Earth after they have completed their missions. Two of these rockets have even flown a second time.\n\nKey to his thinking is the concept of reusability. Space activity is currently expensive only because it is disposable, he says. There is no reason, he claims, why rocket systems cannot be made to operate like airliners where the most significant ongoing cost is the fuel in the tanks.\n\nHis Falcon 9 rocket is partially reusable; the BFR would be totally reusable. The same vehicle would fly time and time again.\n\nMr Musk recognises that his ambitious timelines sometimes slip. When he put up a slide in Adelaide stating that the first cargo (no humans aboard) versions of BFR would go to Mars in 2022, he said: \"That's not a typo, although it is aspirational.\"\n\nHis many fans in the audience lapped up the presentation, but his numerous business customers will also have stiffened slightly at the news that SpaceX is to begin diverting its energies towards an all new rocket system.\n\nThese customers are extremely conservative - as Mr Musk himself conceded. They are only just beginning to grapple with the idea that they can put their very expensive satellites on \"second-hand\" Falcons. Now they must also get used to the idea that the Falcon will eventually be replaced by another rocket system - the BFR.", "(Maye Musk (left) with Elon Musk (right) at the Oscar's Vanity Fair party, February 27, 2017.Reuters/Danny Moloshok)\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk doesn't give special treatment to family members.\n\nMaye Musk, the latest CoverGirl model and mother of Elon, told the New York Times that she's still waiting for the Model 3.\n\n\"I haven't gotten the 3 yet.

Dyson is attempting to crash the party at a time when traditional carmakers are embroiled in an electric vehicle (EV) arms race.\n\nSome of Britain's biggest car manufacturers - steeped in the engineering and regulatory challenges that come with every new launch - reckon Dyson will struggle to rush a new EV into showrooms by 2020.\n\nThe Wiltshire-based company has a team of 400 engineers on the project, which has been under wraps for two and a half years. But he consumer technology firm is moving into the cut-throat world of car manufacturing with a blank sheet of paper - it has an electric motor, but no chassis and no manufacturing plant.\n\nA source at one carmaker, with knowledge of EV production, said: \"It is a challenge because getting a car to market is a long process. We are launching a new electric car next year. That process started five or six years ago - and we have everything in place (manufacturing facilities, established supply chain and manpower).\"\n\nBeyond manufacturing challenges, the source reckons Dyson's ambitious plan would be severely tested by the time it takes for each new vehicle to be passed fit by regulators.\n\n\"The complexity of crash regulations alone is huge,\" the source said. \"Each car must be compliant in each market.\"\n\nHe said it takes \"years rather than months\" to get a new vehicle through the EU's rigorous safety testing process until it is awarded a certificate of conformity.\n\nHigh end, small volume\n\nDr Paul Nieuwenhuis, senior lecturer at Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, believes Dyson is aiming to follow Tesla's lead - by producing small amounts to sell at a high price.\n\nTesla, Elon Musk's California-based EV pioneer, has forced the hand of industry giants, such as Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors, to respond with their own EV launches.\n\n\"The timescale sounds tight if you are developing the car and building it,\" Nieuwenhuis said. \"Some manufacturers have managed it in three years. However, they do that with a lot of technology carried-over from other models.\n\n\"Britain is stuffed with a lot of engineers with experience specifically in low-volume manufacturing. For example, TVR could produce a new car in 18 months. So if that's the way they are thinking, the timescale is doable but very, very tight. If you are a new entrant, it's much easier to go in at the top, as Tesla has done, than at the bottom.\"\n\nDyson has experience of entering crowded markets at the premium end and convincing consumers to spend more on its products than cheaper alternatives, as it did with its pricey vacuum cleaners.\n\nDyson indicated the car might be expensive, saying: \"Maybe the better figure is how much of a deposit they would be prepared to put down.\"\n\nTesla's Model 3, the Palo Alto firm's first \"mass market\" vehicle, still comes with a comparatively hefty $35,000 price tag. However, the entry level Model S costs $94,000, while a Model X starts at $96,000.\n\nSolid state future\n\nDyson is developing two solid-state batteries, which don't contain liquids like the lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and electric cars. In theory, these batteries are safer, can be recharged more quickly and can hold a charge for longer.\n\nJapanese auto-firm Toyota announced earlier this year that it hopes to have cars with solid-state batteries on sale by 2020 - the same time frame as Dyson.\n\nWhile carmakers are battling to develop the best batteries, they are also fighting to secure enough of the key minerals used to manufacture these power packs.\n\nVW is scrambling to secure long-term supplies of cobalt, a vital component of rechargeable batteries. The world's largest carmaker has asked cobalt producers to submit proposals by the end of September to supply VW with the key mineral for up to 10 years from 2019.\n\nVW has accelerated its EV ambitions following the \"dieselgate\" scandal and plans to invest more than $24bn in zero-emission vehicles by 2030. It aims to ramp up EV production to 3m a year by 2025.\n\nOthers, such as Nissan, are buying up battery capacity to secure supply for future EV demand.\n\n\"All of these things create huge question marks for Dyson,\" said a source twho works with some of the world's biggest auto companies.\n\nDyson has hinted that although Britain remains a \"frontrunner\" to build the car, it is more likely the vehicle will be manufactured in the Far East. The British firm already has manufacturing operations in Malaysia.\n\nExperts believe Dyson will develop the vehicle and all future Dyson cars in Britain, but build them in China. It is not only cheaper to manufacture a new car in China, it is also where the market is.\n\n\"Wherever we make the battery, that's where we will make the car,\" Dyson said. \"We see a very large market for this car in the Far East ... We want to be near where our markets are and I believe the Far East has reacted [to electric] more quickly than the UK or Europe.\"\n\nNieuwenhuis noted that China is by far the biggest market in the world for EVs; it is also the biggest market for luxury cars. \"So that makes sense,\" he added.\n\nIn 2016, 507,000 EVs and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) were sold in China, a 53% increase from 2015, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Chinese car firms accounted for around 90% of these sales.\n\nMeanwhile, 222,200 EVs and PHEVs were sold in Europe, a 14% increase year-on-year and 157,130 units were sold in the US, up 36% from the prior year, according to EV Volumes according to industry analysts EV Volumes.\n\nThe pro-electric Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to improve air quality in the country's congested cities, with Beijing offering subsidies and other incentives to auto companies.\n\nStrong demand plus government support for EV technology is an attractive combination for the auto industry.\n\nDyson insisted the venture will make a profit. But, the right technology and compelling offers of state support still don't guarantee success. Tesla has benefitted from huge US subsidies dished out to EV buyers. Despite this, the poster child of the EV sector remains loss-making.\n\nThe source with knowledge of EV production at one carmaker noted: \"Tesla hasn't made a quid yet. Breaking into the auto market is difficult. Tesla has done it, but last year's figures show it sold 76,000 vehicles with no profit.\"\n\nJaguar Land Rover to make only electric or hybrid cars from 2020\n\nElectric cars: everything you need to know\n\nChargers, ch\u00e2teaux and the Channel Tunnel: can you really do a driving holiday in a Tesla?", "Japan's Panasonic said on Friday it will start producing car batteries at its former television screen plant in Japan, accelerating its battery drive to meet anticipated demand for electric vehicles.\n\nPanasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla's mass-market Model 3, is reinventing itself as a provider of advanced car parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products.\n\nThe new battery production will start at its LCD plant in Himeji, western Japan, in the financial year from April 2019, using space left vacant after it closed its unprofitable TV screen manufacturing business last year.\n\nRead more Why Dyson made an error investing in electric cars\n\nThe company declined to comment on the size of new investment or the production capacity of the new line.\n\nThe Himeji plant currently produces screens for vehicle dashboards and medical equipment, but output has dropped significantly after it exited TV screen production.\n\nPanasonic sees batteries as a key driver for its plan to nearly double its car business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen (\u00a316bn) in the year through March 2022.\n\nAlready one of the leading suppliers of car lithium ion batteries, it currently has five production sites in Japan.\n\nIt started mass production of battery cells at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada earlier this year and plans to follow suit at a new plant in Dalian, China.\n\nReuters\n\nMore about: Panasonic electric cars Reuse content", "In this image provided by SpaceXa leftover booster rocket lands at Florida's Kennedy Space Center, Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017.

Of course, the sophisticated climate control systems that take regular temperature and humidity readings and pump fresh, clean air into the atmosphere do a very good job of ensuring that every morning is a warm and humid morning. Rubbing his eyes and checking the time on the smartwatch he keeps by his bedside, an eccentric billionaire begins his day. It's the crack of dawn and Mars's twin moons Deimos and Phobos still cast the sun's reflection into his window, watching over our hero like a great business magnate in the sky presiding over his many galactic assets. He was up late last night, making great headway on his latest project - an environmentally friendly car suited to the dusty roads of the red planet. He looks at himself in a mirror, looking at the bags under his eyes, which have steadily accumulated mass throughout his project's duration.\n\nFive more minutes couldn't hurt, he thinks to himself, as he dons his nightgown and lets his aching body meet his mattress once more, the distant sighs of rocket engines and the faint but constant hum of the Martian life support systems lulling him into a sleep as deep as the planet's biggest crater.\n\nElon Musk snaps back to reality. The world is in chaos. We've done irreparable damage to our ecosystem. Nuclear war is very much on the table. This isn't sleek. This isn't sexy. This does not fit the image that Musk has for the world. Elon knows he could theoretically put his resources towards improving things in general, but he has no incentive to do so. Saving the world is neither sleek nor sexy. It's no Tesla vehicle, no Hyperloop. The world, to Musk, is not worth saving. But escaping the mess we've made? That's something Musk can sell.\n\nElon Musk lives in what can only be described as a science fiction novel. For Musk, the biggest existential threat to humanity is neither war, nor climate change nor natural disaster - it's artificial intelligence. As a student who got a C+ in Software Engineering, I find it difficult to believe that I'll be the one to build SkyNet any time soon. Of course, his skewed priorities are not kind enough to end there. Elon Musk firmly believes that we're living in a simulation and, to top it off, that we are being visited by intelligent extraterrestrial beings. While the rest of us are active in our communities, working towards the betterment of our university and our society, Elon is out on his porch with a pair of binoculars, looking for UFOs and space aliens. I believe Musk may need a nice, long electric car ride back to reality.\n\nThe terrifying thing about living out in space, as I am reasonably confident Elon Musk does, is that one begins to overlook the affairs of earthlings. Earlier this year, Tesla factory workers filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. Illegal surveillance, coercion and intimidation were used against Tesla's workers. Did Elon know that a Tesla subcontractor was paying its eastern European workers far below minimum wage? Did he care to admit to his investors in 2008 that Tesla Motors had almost no money? Of course not, for these things are of no concern to space men.\n\nI understand that a man whose paycheck is only matched in size by his ego and his cult of personality can be very attractive. What I struggle to see is why the community of engineers, scientists and other such people who purport to know what they're talking about are so infatuated with someone with a complete lack of understanding of the world around him.

A Tesla spokeswoman said last night that the Australian Energy Market Operator had approved the \"interconnection agreement\".\n\nShe said Tesla and Neoen now had 100 days to complete the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world.\n\nShe said it would provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes. \"It will help solve power outages,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this year the tech billionaire, 46, weighed into the state's energy crisis, boldly claiming he could fix the problem for $33 million and in under 100 days or it's free.\n\nThe battery systems will be paired with 99 wind turbines at Neoen's Hornsdale Wind Farm.Mr Musk, greeted by the crowd with cheers and an \"onya Elon\", told\n\nguests the battery packs now on site had been installed within two\n\nmonths.\n\n\"You couldn't get your kitchen done that fast,\" he said."]}, "Airbus": {"2017-09-28": ["American Airlines will add more seats to some of its single-aisle jetliners as part an effort to boost sales by $1.4 billion in the next four years. It's also targeting $1 billion in cost savings.\n\nThe carrier's Boeing Co. 737-800 jets will be revamped to fit 12 more passengers while the Airbus SE A321 planes will carry as many as nine more, according to a presentation Thursday. The world's largest airline also plans to bolster group sales, update technology systems and seek to persuade more customers to upgrade to higher fares.\n\nThe move isn't likely to be welcomed by travelers, many of whom complain about getting less space on U.S. aircraft. American didn't provide details of the seat additions, although Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker did pledge not to go below 30 inches of pitch, which is the distance from a point on one seat to the same point on the seat in front of it.\n\nThe Fort Worth-based carrier ditched a previous plan to drop to 29 inches in a few rows on some planes after employees and travelers protested.\n\nThe plans almost double the amount of revenue gains by 2021 from previously announced efforts to expand sales amid rising fuel costs and heightened competition from heavy discounters. While a new fare war broke out in the summer among U.S. airlines, Parker reaffirmed his view that industry consolidation will enable carriers to post steady profits and leave behind years of boom-and-bust cycles.\n\n\"I don't think we're ever going to lose money again,\" he said at American's investor day in Grapevine, Texas. \"This is an airline and an industry that will be profitable in good and bad years.\"\n\nAmerican climbed 1.4 percent to $47.49 at the close in New York, leading a Standard & Poor's index of the five biggest U.S. carriers. American has advanced 1.7 percent this year, while the broader gauge declined 1.1 percent.\n\nIncluding the new initiatives and previous programs to boost revenue by $1.5 billion, the airline said it expects total improvements of $2.9 billion. That's on top of the cost reductions.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, American will begin revamping some narrow-body planes with new seats, satellite Wi-Fi service, larger overhead bins and power for passenger devices at seats.\n\nThe 737-800 jets will go to 172 seats from 160 seats, matching the total for American's upgraded 737 Max aircraft. The A321 planes will be outfitted to carry 190 passengers. That's an increase of three for the jets originally from US Airways, which merged with American in 2013, and a gain of nine for the aircraft operated by American before the transaction.\n\nThe carrier estimated that standardizing the interiors at a higher seat count will generate about $500 million in revenue through 2021.\n\nAmerican won't lay off employees if the 417 efficiency projects it has on tap reveal some parts of the company are overstaffed, Parker said. Options could include attrition, reassigning workers to other jobs or establishing an early retirement plan, he said.\n\n\"That's really important to us,\" Parker said in an interview. \"We need efficiency, but not if efficiency disrupts progress with our team.\"\n\nAmerican this month reiterated its willingness to \"absolutely, positively\" match discount fares to compete with Southwest Airlines Co. and heavy discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc., indicating there would be no near-term end to a price war that reignited this summer.\n\nParker said he was happy with American's fleet plans and had no interest in adding new aircraft types. He declined to comment on the U.S. Commerce Department's decision this week to slap import duties on Bombardier Inc.'s C Series jets. The agency cited unfair Canadian subsidies in announcing the move.

The Pentagon's 2017 budget called for buying seven more Apache helicopters, 12 St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornets and for V-22 Ospreys from the company.\n\nMany of these contracts also cover research and development expenses that can nurture new products, such as a $499 million deal to help the Air Force develop future air vehicles.\n\nIn some cases, the company gets tax breaks from state governments hoping to lure high-paying engineering jobs, such as an $8.7 billion tax break the company received from the state of Washington in exchange for setting up jobs there. Others argue that the U.S. Export-Import Bank indirectly facilitates Boeing's sales abroad, because the bank's loans effectively allow foreign airliners to purchase Boeing-made jets at a discount.\n\nAt the heart of the Commerce Department's proposed tariff is Bombardier's C series CS100 commercial jet, which seats about 100. Last year, Bombardier agreed to sell 75 commercial jetliners to Delta Air Lines in a multibillion-dollar deal.\n\nBoeing's objection to the deal mystified some. Boeing was not a competitor in Bombardier's bid for Delta's business last year and does not make a similar plane.\n\nSome saw it as a political move.\n\n\"The less savory aspect of this is it's a great chance for Boeing to find common ground with Donald Trump to please the economic nationalist wing of his base,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group, a firm that provides aerospace and defense analysis.\n\nA week before Tuesday's decision, Bombardier released a sharply worded statement titled \"Boeing's hypocrisy,\" linking to a Seattle Times article that detailed how Boeing has sold the 787 Dreamliner at a loss for years, in the hope that it eventually will make up the difference in future sales.\n\n\"It is pure hypocrisy for Boeing to say that the C Series launch pricing is a 'violation of global trade law' when Boeing does the same for its new aircraft,\" Bombardier said in its statement.\n\nBoeing rejected the comparison.\n\n\"It is simply inappropriate to equate the billions in subsidies Bombardier and companies like Airbus have received with state-level investment incentives and export credit agencies like the Export-Import Bank, to which Boeing's customers currently do not have access,\" the company said Tuesday.\n\nOfficials at the Commerce Department described the duty as an effort to level the playing field.\n\n\"The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. \"The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\"\n\nThe size of the tariffs raised eyebrows. Such a large tariff is exceedingly rare for a multimillion-dollar item like a jet plane. If the U.S. government follows through with the tariff, it would more than triple the price for customers inside the United States, costs that would be passed through to the supplier.\n\n\"I've never seen one this big on this expensive of a product,\" said Jenkins, the AAI chairman. \"The tariff makes the price completely unreasonable.\"\n\nThe attention-getting size of the tariff could be a bargaining chip to win trade concessions as the government moves through the process of finalizing the duty. The Commerce Department did not specify what subsidies Bombardier received that it considered improper, only citing support from the governments of Canada, Britain and the provincial government of Quebec in calculating its decision.\n\nThe alleged subsidies could include hundreds of millions of dollars in loans Bombardier has received from the Canadian government over its C series aircraft for years, most recently a $372.5 million interest-free loan announced in February 2017. Last year the company received a $1 billion investment from the Quebec provincial government related to the C series plane.\n\nBritish and Canadian leaders have said the dispute would damage Boeing's chances to win defense contracts with their respective governments.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded the alarm last week, saying his government might cancel a previous proposal to buy 18 Super Hornets.\n\nNews of the tariff sparked dismay in Britain, where Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to maintain the country's economic advantage as it prepares to divorce itself from the European Union as part of the Brexit process.\n\nBombardier employs about 4,000 people in Belfast, many of whom work on the CS100.\n\nMay's office tweeted that it was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the Tuesday evening ruling.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday in Belfast, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said he would not cancel an existing deal to buy eight spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters from Boeing, but said the slight would hurt Boeing in future competitions, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\n\"This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,\" Fallon said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nStill others are worried that Bombardier will become an example to other foreign firms thinking of setting up shop in the United States, adding a tinge of uncertainty to the broader U.S. business climate.\n\n\"Any resurgence of 'made in America' is going to depend on our ability to attract foreign firms to set up shop here,\" said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a nonprofit group that advocates for open markets.", "On my flight back from a recent business trip to Washington, D.C., I had to first fly to Detroit with Delta Air Lines and then to Inchon Airport from Detroit; the direct flight to Seoul from Washington happened to be full that day. While on the trip, I noticed significant changes in the U.S. airline industry. Most low-cost carriers that were once prominent in the 1990s have all but disappeared, and through mergers between carriers, currently there are only six major airlines, such as American Airlines and Delta, instead of 11 in 2014.\n\nThe Delta plane I was on for the flight to Detroit -- a small aircraft that seats fewer than 100 passengers with a one-person crew -- was being used for domestic routes from Washington to Detroit and Milwaukee. I noticed that the aircraft was Canadian-made rather than a Boeing. The Delta Boeing plane that flew us from Detroit to Seoul also appeared to be old compared to planes used by Korean carriers. The number of crew on the plane also seemed to be less than what you would typically find on international flights run by Korean carriers.\n\nSo I wondered, what had happened to the U.S. airline industry? Incidentally, I found the answer to my question while reading a Delta magazine. Page 13 had an advertisement that read to the effect, \"Please help save American jobs. The United Arab Emirates is subsidizing its carrier with billions of dollars and expanding market shares. American carriers cannot compete with the UAE carrier and are on the brink of bankruptcy, and Americans are losing their jobs.\"\n\nThe seemingly desperate advertisement was designed to appeal to American patriotism by U.S. carriers going through painful restructuring and consolidation, where even a U.S. carrier, Delta, has been compelled to buy more than 100 aircraft for its domestic routes, not from U.S.-based Boeing, but from Canadian and Brazilian manufacturers. Boeing and Airbus of Europe have also had to shift their focus to manufacturing small and medium-sized aircraft; last year, Airbus did not receive a single order for the A380, their largest flagship aircraft.\n\nI now had a visceral understanding of why Donald Trump's America First policy and trade protectionism had gained support in the United States. But, alas, I realized that I should have noted the advent of the Trump phenomenon earlier, when I had heard of a factory in Georgia, opened six years before and lauded for creating 80 jobs, which manufactured and exported wooden chopsticks to China. I wondered at the time how it was that the U.S., once so economically dominant, had been reduced to exporting wooden chopsticks while importing computers and high-tech items from China? To further illustrate the point, it was reported three years ago that rich Chinese were paying American women $150,000 to be surrogate mothers so that their children could gain U.S. citizenship.\n\nWe can only guess that such stories must have been humiliating for some Americans, whose nation was founded on the principles of industriousness and moral integrity by those fleeing Europe to build a new society. The humiliation and despair that come with the decline in the U.S. economy have been building for years and finally engendered the presidency of Trump, a political outsider. Trump did not win the presidency with his personal appeal alone.\n\nHowever, the U.S. went through a similar phenomenon in the late 19th century when the country, plagued by weak political leadership, experienced ultra-nationalism, white supremacy and imperialism. At the time, the U.S. met the challenge with technological innovations in the private sector that changed the paradigm of the world economy: Ford Motor Co. revolutionized the transportation sector and Bell Telephone Co., likewise, transformed the communication sector of the economy. The United States will once again meet the current challenge with new innovations and will reset the world economic structure in the process. South Korea ought to be prepared for the coming new economic paradigm.", "American Airlines Group Inc. will add more seats to some of its single-aisle jetliners as part an effort to boost sales by $1.4 billion in the next few years.\n\nThe carrier's Boeing Co. 737-800 jets will be revamped to fit 12 more passengers while the Airbus SE A321 planes will carry as many as nine more, according to a presentation Thursday. The world's largest airline also plans to bolster group sales, upgrade technology systems and seek to persuade more customers to upgrade to higher fares.\n\nThe plans almost double American's target for revenue gains by 2021 as the company steps up efforts to expand sales amid rising fuel costs and heightened competition from heavy discounters. While a new fare war broke out in the summer among U.S. airlines, American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker reaffirmed his view that industry consolidation will enable carriers to post steady profits and leave behind years of boom-and-bust cycles.\n\n\"I don't think we're ever going to lose money again,\" he said at American's investor day in Grapevine, Texas. \"This is an airline and an industry that will be profitable in good and bad years.\"\n\nAmerican climbed 1.4 percent to $47.49 at the close in New York, leading a Standard & Poor's index of the five biggest U.S. carriers. American has advanced 1.7 percent this year, while the broader gauge declined 1.1 percent.\n\nIncluding the new initiatives and previous initiatives to boost revenue by $1.5 billion, the airline said it expects total improvements of $2.9 billion. It's also targeting $1 billion in costs thanks to more than 400 projects to increase efficiency.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, American will begin revamping some narrow-body planes with new seats, satellite Wi-Fi service, larger overhead bins and power for passenger devices at seats.\n\nThe 737-800 jets will go to 172 seats from 160 seats, matching the total for American's upgraded 737 Max aircraft. The A321 planes will be outfitted to carry 190 passengers. That's an increase of three for the jets originally from US Airways, which merged with American in 2013, and a gain of nine for the aircraft operated by American before the transaction.\n\nThe carrier estimated that standardizing the interiors at a higher seat count will generate about $500 million in revenue through 2021.\n\nAmerican this month reiterated its willingness to \"absolutely, positively\" match discount fares to compete with Southwest Airlines Co. and heavy discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc., indicating there would be no near-term end to a price war that reignited this summer.\n\nParker said he was happy with American's fleet plans and had no interest in adding new aircraft types. He declined to comment on the U.S. Commerce Department's decision this week to slap import duties on Bombardier Inc.'s C Series jets. The agency cited unfair Canadian subsidies in announcing the move.

EasyJet said its support for electric planes was part of a broader strategy to reduce carbon and nitrous oxide emissions in the aviation sector, following the lead taken by the rail and automotive industries.

They're all great, but the vast majority of them are merely ideas, or if they do physically exist, they haven't reached the point where anyone would dream of climbing aboard. This week, a company called Passenger Drone came out of seemingly nowhere and unveiled its own two-person passenger aircraft that not only already exists, but even has successful manned flights under its belt.\n\nThe vehicle, which is called simply PassengerDrone -- yes, that's the company name but without the space, so just stick with me here and we'll get through this -- is powered by 16 individual motors paired with propellers, which the company says offers both stability and redundancy. But the most interesting thing about it is that, well, it doesn't actually look half bad.\n\nIts dual seats are situated like those in a helicopter, with the rear seat positioned behind and elevated slight above that of the pilot. I say \"pilot\" because while the craft is capable of flying autonomously (making it a drone) it also offers a manual flight mode, complete with joystick-like flight controls.\n\nPassenger Drone says it's been developing the PassengerDrone (this is getting confusing) for roughly three years, deciding not to seek out media attention until their vehicle was actually ready for the spotlight. Now that the company has successfully completed manned flight tests, apparently now is that time.\n\nIt's definitely an interesting addition to the lightly populated manned drone space, and seems to be closer to the \"flying car\" future than most of its competitors, but there's still some pretty big questions that need to be answered.\n\nFor starters, the company mentions how the drone could alleviate traffic congestion and provide a zero-emission alternative to traditional vehicles, but actually flying anything like this in a US or European city is still a no-go thanks to red tape and safety regulations. Additionally, there's been no mention of how much it would actually cost to put this thing in your driveway (or landing pad, I guess?), but it most certainly won't be cheap.

The giant plane-maker has been hoping to add a multibillion-dollar fighter-jet sale to its more than US$94 billion in annual revenues.\n\nBut it so happened this visit fell on the same day Boeing filed a trade action against Canada's largest aerospace player, the far smaller Bombardier. It also happened that the Canadian hosts were given little warning.\n\nWord filtered up to the top-floor office of ambassador David MacNaughton about an hour beforehand about the trade action, which this week resulted in whopping 220-per-cent preliminary duties on Bombardier sales.\n\n\"(MacNaughton) called them out of the meeting,\" one source said.\n\nTwo sources say the ambassador delivered a message similar to what's now the Canadian government's public mantra: \"I don't do business with people suing me,\" and, \"You shouldn't treat customers this way.\"\n\nThe Boeing people decided it was better to leave. The meeting was over.\n\nWhat the Canadian government has heard from Boeing is that the company is torn between two imperatives: completing the military sale with Canada and avoiding what it perceives to be a colossal mistake of its past.\n\nThe company has said this publicly.\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Marc Allen, president of Boeing's international division, said: \"We watched another competitor come up and enter the market in a very similar fashion.\"\n\nThat competitor was Airbus, in the 1970s.\n\nA consortium of French, German, and U.K. interests, Airbus started small in the U.S. market, with European subsidies propping up its twin-engine and single-aisle planes. But the product lines, and the planes, grew, and by the 1990s the company had become a U.S. giant in its own right, muscling aside smaller players like McDonnell Douglas.\n\nNow Airbus is aiming for 50 per cent of the American market after opening its first jetliner plant in the U.S.\n\nBoeing claims to fear a repeat. After Bombardier's sale of 75 mid-sized planes to Delta Air Lines, it launched a complaint based on Bombardier's various forms of assistance from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.\n\nNever mind that Boeing is by far the No. 1 recipient of U.S. government subsidies. It drew US$14.4 billion in various forms of assistance since the 1990s according to the website Subsidy Tracker, far more than any other U.S. company and far more than what Bombardier received. The U.S. Export-Import bank is jokingly referred to in Washington as, \"the Bank of Boeing.\"\n\nAnd Boeing doesn't even make planes similar to those Bombardier sold Delta. One Washington critic, Dan Ikenson of the free-market Cato Institute, compares this to a snowplow maker suing a bicycle company.\n\nWhat matters is a smaller rival can grow, Boeing says.\n\nIt repeated that cautionary tale of Airbus several times during a day-long hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n\"Airbus in 40 years has an airplane now in every single market segment,\" said Raymond Conner, Boeing's vice-chairman.\n\n\"What Airbus did is they entered ... the smaller (plane market)... and then moved on from there... Today we are fighting for our lives to maintain upper 40's or 50 per cent (market share). The impact is real and it sometimes takes many years to materialize.\n\n\"What (Airbus has) done in 40 years, we had to do in 100.\"\n\nWashington aeronautics consultant Richard Aboulafia says Boeing is making a grave error. It is antagonizing governments and companies in several countries, including the U.K., where Bombardier has more than 3,000 employees, and angering big U.S. buyer Delta.\n\nThat's not all.\n\nHe says it's harming itself in two other ways: jeopardizing future military contracts in those countries and stoking protectionist sentiment in an industry that relies on international trade.\n\nAnd Boeing might find out its efforts pointless in the end as the Department of Commerce duty could be overturned by the more historically neutral ITC, or by the U.S. domestic trade court, or other international panels.\n\n\"People said the entire Vietnam War was the triumph of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said.\n\n\"You could win a battle and then find yourself having outraged (everyone)... Can (Boeing make) an effective trade complaint? Yeah, probably. What are the second-order effects? Oh my dear God, that's a strategic question. (They'd) rather not think strategically.\"\n\nHe heaps scorn on the idea that this is the ghost of Airbus, stirring again.\n\nAboulafia said it's not the 1970s. The planes are different, the market is different and Canada's subsidies to Bombardier are nowhere close to as threatening as an international consortium being propped up by different countries.\n\nOf the attempt to draw parallels, he says: \"That's what you'd think if you had no sense of strategic history.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter\n\nGet our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.\n\nWeekdays at 6 AM ET.

In April 2017, American and Airbus reached an agreement to defer the carrier's first A350-900 delivery to late ...", "Chicago-based Boeing won a major victory against a foreign competitor earlier this week when the Commerce Department signaled its intent to impose a 219 percent tariff on Canadian-made jetliners, claiming aircraft maker Bombardier has been unfairly propped up by the Canadian government.\n\nBut critics of the decision say Boeing itself benefits from its own form of government support, which includes federal contracts and tax breaks from state governments in the United States -- a reflection of how American corporations are also dependent on government policies, contracts, decisions and in some cases direct financial inducements in their attempts to remain internationally competitive.\n\n\"The truth is anybody who's in aerospace receives some type of subsidy, and certainly Boeing is no exception to that,\" said Darryl Jenkins, chairman of the American Aviation Institute, an independent think tank focusing on the commercial aviation industry.\n\n[U.S. moves to impose tariffs on Canadian jet maker, siding with Boeing]\n\nA large percentage of Boeing's business comes from defense contracts, of which the U.S. military is easily its largest customer.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May's office tweeted that it was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the U.S. government's move. (John Stillwell/AP)\n\nThe company's Arlington-based defense, space and security business reported close to $7 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. The Pentagon's 2017 budget called for buying seven more Apache helicopters, 12 F-18 Super Hornets and for V-22 Ospreys from the company.\n\nMany of these contracts also cover research and development expenses that can nurture new products, such as a $499 million deal to help the Air Force develop future air vehicles.\n\nIn some cases, the company gets tax breaks from state governments hoping to lure high-paying engineering jobs, such as an $8.7 billion tax break the company received from the state of Washington in exchange for setting up jobs there. Others argue that the U.S. Export-Import Bank indirectly facilitates Boeing's sales abroad, because the bank's loans effectively allow foreign airliners to purchase Boeing-made jets at a discount.\n\nAt the heart of the Commerce Department's proposed tariff is Bombardier's C series CS100 commercial jet, which seats about 100. Last year, Bombardier agreed to sell 75 commercial jetliners to Delta Air Lines in a multibillion-dollar deal.\n\nBoeing's objection to the deal mystified some. Boeing was not a competitor in Bombardier's bid for Delta's business last year and does not make a similar plane.\n\nSome saw it as a political move.\n\n\"The less savory aspect of this is it's a great chance for Boeing to find common ground with Donald Trump to please the economic nationalist wing of his base,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group, a firm that provides aerospace and defense analysis.\n\nA week before Tuesday's decision, Bombardier released a sharply worded statement titled \"Boeing's hypocrisy,\" linking to a Seattle Times article that detailed how Boeing has sold the 787 Dreamliner at a loss for years, in the hope that it eventually will make up the difference in future sales.\n\n\"It is pure hypocrisy for Boeing to say that the C Series launch pricing is a 'violation of global trade law' when Boeing does the same for its new aircraft,\" Bombardier said in its statement.\n\nBoeing rejected the comparison.\n\n\"It is simply inappropriate to equate the billions in subsidies Bombardier and companies like Airbus have received with state-level investment incentives and export credit agencies like the Export-Import Bank, to which Boeing's customers currently do not have access,\" the company said Tuesday.\n\nOfficials at the Commerce Department described the duty as an effort to level the playing field.\n\n\"The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. \"The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\"\n\nThe size of the tariffs raised eyebrows. Such a large tariff is exceedingly rare for a multi\u00admillion-dollar item like a jet plane. If the U.S. government follows through with the tariff, it would more than triple the price for customers inside the United States, costs that would be passed through to the supplier.\n\n\"I've never seen one this big on this expensive of a product,\" said Jenkins, the AAI chairman. \"The tariff makes the price completely unreasonable.\"\n\nThe attention-getting size of the tariff could be a bargaining chip to win trade concessions as the government moves through the process of finalizing the duty. The Commerce Department did not specify what subsidies Bombardier received that it considered improper, only citing support from the governments of Canada, Britain and the provincial government of Quebec in calculating its decision.\n\nThe alleged subsidies could include hundreds of millions of dollars in loans Bombardier has received from the Canadian government over its C series aircraft for years, most recently a $372.5 million interest-free loan announced in February 2017. Last year the company received a $1 billion investment from the Quebec provincial government related to the C series plane.\n\n[Why America's biggest government contractors balked at criticizing Trump]\n\nBritish and Canadian leaders have said the dispute would damage Boeing's chances to win defense contracts with their respective governments.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded the alarm last week, saying his government might cancel a previous proposal to buy Boeing F-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.\n\nNews of the tariff sparked dismay in Britain, where Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to maintain the country's economic advantage as it prepares to divorce itself from the European Union as part of the Brexit process.\n\nBombardier employs about 4,000 people in Belfast, many of whom work on the CS100.\n\nMay's office tweeted that it was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the Tuesday evening ruling.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday in Belfast, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said he would not cancel an existing deal to buy eight spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters from Boeing, but said the slight would hurt Boeing in future competitions, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\n\"This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,\" Fallon said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nStill others are worried that Bombardier will become an example to other foreign firms thinking of setting up shop in the United States, adding a tinge of uncertainty to the broader U.S. business climate.\n\n\"Any resurgence of 'made in America' is going to depend on our ability to attract foreign firms to set up shop here,\" said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a nonprofit group that advocates for open markets.", "Avmax has taken delivery of the second batch of six aircraft of a 27 Bombardier Dash 8-100 aircraft purchase deal from Piedmont Airlines, subsidiary of American Airlines, with delivery stream through the first quarter of 2018.\n\nAerCap delivered a second Airbus A320neo to Russia's S7 Airlines Sept. 21.

I was invited to open the proceedings.\n\nThere were 100 delegates from all over the world. They ranged from the UK to Poland, from Denmark to the US, from Australia to Japan, from Spain to Namibia, from Zimbabwe to Rwanda, and I could go on.\n\nThe conference was MECA SENS 2017 and it has never been held in Africa before. That strange looking name derives from Mechanical Stress Evaluation by Neutron and Synchrotron Radiation. What this mouthful means is that these fellows use beams, like a beam of neutrons out of a nuclear reactor and a high-powered X-ray beam from a very fancy nuclear accelerator called a synchrotron.\n\nThey use these beams to penetrate deep into materials such as stainless steel and fancy aluminium alloys to find out what happens to their atoms when you pull, twist or squeeze the metal.\n\nThat type of knowledge is really important for the building of nuclear reactors and other hi-tech devices such as an Airbus or Boeing. If a piece of stainless steel is used in nuclear reactor construction and by bad luck that piece had not been cooled correctly when it was made in the first place then it can happen that some of the alloy atoms have \"frozen\" into the wrong positions in the iron matrix.\n\nWhat that could mean is that the stainless steel is maybe 20% less strong than it was supposed to be. That is serious when the nuclear engineers build a reactor to very precise tolerances and find that what they thought was like a very strong face brick is actually only a weak low-grade common stock brick.\n\nYou would not want to discover something like that five years after the house was built and the engineer signed off on the integrity of the structure.\n\nWhat the scientists who gathered at the Kruger Park do is very much like brick laying with atoms. They look at things like: if the \"bricklaying\" did go wrong during the making of the metal or maybe as a result of incorrect welding, what will happen if you twist the metal. Will it break and where.\n\nMomentous discoveries\n\nWith these beams these fellows can \"see\" rows of atoms and take pictures of them. When I was at school my teachers told me that atoms were too small for humans to ever actually see them. That has turned out to not be true.\n\nRound about the time when Einstein was making momentous discoveries and predictions, about a century ago, another physics development was unfolding in parallel. That was called; Quantum Mechanics.\n\nThe \"mechanics\" part is a bit silly, because there is nothing \"mechanical\" about it, but the fellows at the time had no clue what they were finding, because it was all so odd. With quantum mechanics and Einstein's seemingly crazy ideas all at the same time the scientists of the day were scientifically shell-shocked.\n\nOne of the strange things that came out of the quantum mechanics part was that a beam of particles also exhibits a wave-like nature. Science called this the wave-particle duality.\n\nSo, to cut a long complex story short, a beam of electrons or neutrons also acts like light, with a wave character. So it is possible to send a beam of neutrons through a solid hunk of steel and then their wave nature will cause them to project a picture of the atoms inside.\n\nIf you want to witness real excitement, just watch some of those scientists in the Kruger Park looking at a picture of rows of atoms in aluminium where they can clearly see where a crack is beginning.\n\nThe sort of crack that makes an Airbus suddenly fall out of the sky when an engine breaks apart or the tail snaps off. Or that splits a nuclear reactor pressure vessel open at midnight on a Sunday and gives the chief engineer a bad start to his week.\n\nThe folks gathered in the Kruger Park included some very smart senior people with world-wide reputations built up over decades. But they also included very smart post-graduate students from South Africa, Botswana, Algeria, Italy, China and elsewhere. The students are doing great work and are following in the footsteps of the seniors.\n\nDr Kelvin Kemm is a nuclear physicist and chairperson of the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa).\n\n-BUSINESS REPORT", "IN 1845 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, a French economist, wrote an open letter to his national parliament, pleading for help on behalf of makers of candles and other forms of lighting. The French market was being flooded with cheap light, he complained. Action was necessary: a law closing all windows, shutters and curtains. Only that would offer protection against the source of this \"ruinous competition\", the sun.\n\nThree similar pleas are facing the administration of President Donald Trump. But these are not parodies. On September 22nd the United States International Trade Commission paved the way for import restrictions on solar panels, ruling that imports had injured American cell manufacturers. On September 26th the Department of Commerce pencilled in tariffs of 220% on airliners made by Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer. A third decision on washing machines is due by October 5th.\n\nThis cluster of cases represents around $15bn of annual imports, less than 0.6% of the total. But they are chunky relative to other requests, and unusually timed. \"Usually these trade cases come in waves, driven by a recession or a strong dollar\", says Douglas Irwin, an economic historian at Dartmouth College. Not this time.\n\nEvery protectionist is unhappy in his own way. Boeing, an American aeroplane-maker, claims that Bombardier used government subsidies to sell its new C-series airliners below cost. Fred Cromer of Bombardier Aerospace accuses Boeing of a \"commercial attack\" to reduce competition. Boeing has not made planes of the same size as the C-Series since 2006, and all planemakers sell aircraft at a loss in the early years of new models. Senior advisers to Boeing concede that they were too late to spot the competitive threat from subsidies to Airbus, a European rival. They want to hit Bombardier before it grows up.\n\nThe case of solar panels was brought by Suniva and SolarWorld Americas. They blame financial troubles on imported solar cells, which surged by 500% between 2012 and 2016. Cheap Chinese supply has not been contained by narrower anti-dumping duties, they claim, as producers have set up operations in third countries.\n\nWhirlpool, an American domestic-appliance company, is seeking broad protection for its washing machines, also complaining that its competitors have bypassed tariffs. Rising imports from Thailand and Vietnam more than offset the drop in imports from China between 2015 and 2016. Its opponents in the case accuse it of fiddling the definition of washing machine to show a surge, and have suggested the company has lost market share because of its fading brand recognition.\n\nEven if the cases fizzle, some damage would already have been done. The uncertainty the trade actions introduce often has a chilling effect on trade and investment. But Mr Trump seems to be itching to impose tariffs, and some import restrictions seem almost certain. This would sour international relations. The British government has threatened retaliation over the threat to the jobs of Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. The actions will most probably be challenged at the World Trade Organisation. They also risk complicating the continuing renegotiation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a deal between America, Mexico and Canada. The original deal contains protections for Mexican and Canadian exporters against this sort of trade action.\n\nMr Bastiat's satirical plea to the French parliament explicitly pitted producers against consumers. Similarly, pricier solar panels, washing machines or plane tickets will lighten consumers' wallets. American businesses that use solar panels would be hurt by import restrictions, too. Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower, an American solar-energy company, and an opponent of the action taken by Suniva and SolarWorld, reports that this is the hot topic among his employees. He points out that the two petitioning companies employ a tiny fraction of America's solar-energy workforce. The industry association is warning that 88,000 jobs would be at risk if tariffs were imposed.\n\nFor trade watchers, one of the most worrying elements of these cases is the way that the solar-panel and washing-machine companies have gone about seeking remedies. Both have resorted to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. That allows firms broad trade protection but has not been invoked since 2001. It fell out of use because of the high legal threshold for proving injury, and the tendency of previous American governments to reject tariffs in the broader national interest. Companies may be responding to signals from the present administration that it will be sympathetic to claims. \"The worry is that this is a crack open of the door and it's about to swing open,\" says Mr Irwin -- a rare case where closed might be better than open.", "But it so happened this visit fell on the same day Boeing filed a trade action against Canada's largest aerospace player, the far smaller Bombardier. It also happened that the Canadian hosts were given little warning.\n\nWord filtered up to the top-floor office of ambassador David MacNaughton about an hour beforehand about the trade action, which this week resulted in whopping 220-per-cent preliminary duties on Bombardier sales.\n\n\"(MacNaughton) called them out of the meeting,\" one source said.\n\nTwo sources say the ambassador delivered a message similar to what's now the Canadian government's public mantra: \"I don't do business with people suing me\" and \"You shouldn't treat customers this way.\"\n\nThe Boeing people decided it was better to leave. The meeting was over.\n\nWhat the Canadian government has heard from Boeing is that the company is torn between two imperatives: completing the military sale with Canada and avoiding what it perceives to be a colossal mistake of its past.\n\nThe company has said this publicly.\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Marc Allen, president of Boeing's international division, said: \"We watched another competitor come up and enter the market in a very similar fashion.\"\n\nThat competitor was Airbus, in the 1970s.\n\nA consortium of French, German and U.K. interests, Airbus started small in the U.S. market, with European subsidies propping up its twin-engine and single-aisle planes. But the product lines and the planes grew, and by the 1990s, the company had become a U.S. giant in its own right, muscling aside smaller players such as McDonnell Douglas.\n\nNow, Airbus is aiming for 50 per cent of the American market after opening its first jetliner plant in the U.S.\n\nBoeing claims to fear a repeat. After Bombardier's sale of 75 mid-sized planes to Delta Air Lines, it launched a complaint based on Bombardier's various forms of assistance from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.\n\nNever mind that Boeing is by far the No. 1 recipient of U.S. government subsidies. It drew $14.4 billion in various forms of assistance since the 1990s, according to the website Subsidy Tracker, far more than any other U.S. company and far more than what Bombardier received. The U.S. Export-Import Bank is jokingly referred to in Washington as \"the Bank of Boeing.\"\n\nAnd Boeing doesn't even make planes similar to those Bombardier sold Delta. One Washington critic, Dan Ikenson of the free-market Cato Institute, compares this to a snowplow maker suing a bicycle company.\n\nWhat matters is a smaller rival can grow, Boeing says.\n\nIt repeated that cautionary tale of Airbus several times during a daylong hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).\n\n\"Airbus in 40 years has an airplane now in every single market segment,\" said Raymond Conner, Boeing's vice-chairperson.\n\n\"What Airbus did is they entered . . . the smaller (plane market) . . . and then moved on from there . . . Today, we are fighting for our lives to maintain upper 40s or 50 per cent (market share). The impact is real and it sometimes takes many years to materialize.\n\n\"What (Airbus has) done in 40 years, we had to do in 100.\"\n\nWashington aeronautics consultant Richard Aboulafia says Boeing is making a grave error. It is antagonizing governments and companies in several countries, including the U.K., where Bombardier has more than 3,000 employees, and angering big U.S. buyer Delta.\n\nThat's not all.\n\nHe says it's harming itself in two other ways: jeopardizing future military contracts in those countries and stoking protectionist sentiment in an industry that relies on international trade.\n\nAnd Boeing might find its efforts pointless in the end, as the Department of Commerce duty could be overturned by the more historically neutral ITC, or by the U.S. domestic trade court, or other international panels.\n\n\"People said the entire Vietnam War was the triumph of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said.\n\n\"You could win a battle and then find yourself having outraged (everyone) . . . Can (Boeing make) an effective trade complaint? Yeah, probably. What are the second-order effects? Oh my dear God, that's a strategic question. (They'd) rather not think strategically.\"\n\nHe heaps scorn on the idea that this is the ghost of Airbus stirring again.\n\nAboulafia said it's not the 1970s. The planes are different, the market is different and Canada's subsidies to Bombardier are nowhere close to as threatening as an international consortium being propped up by different countries.\n\nOf the attempt to draw parallels, he says: \"That's what you'd think if you had no sense of strategic history.\"", "Santa Barbara Airbus began a fleet modernization program in late 2016 to enhance the customer experience by providing newer luxury transportation to and from LAX by adding four new VanHool coaches to its fleet.\n\nSanta Barbara Airbus completed the first phase of the overhaul by unveiling the latest addition two weeks ago.

Throughout my time as DETI and DEL Minister I am content that all transactions with Bombardier were consistent with EU State Aid rules.\n\n\"In the United States both cities and states give very substantial tax incentives and breaks to Boeing and other manufacturers.

This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions.\n\nThe growing preference for more-electric aircraft (MEA) will propel the requirement for advanced heat transfer and fluid management systems. As these aircraft employ relatively higher units of onboard electronics components and systems, the heat generation from individual units needs to be addressed to maintain the effectiveness of each component. Likewise, the installation of multiple fuel tanks in long-haul flights will require the incorporation of advanced thermal management mechanisms.\n\nThis report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only: View market snapshot before purchasing\n\nBuy 1 Technavio report and get the second for 50% off.

Request a free sample report\n\nTechnavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.\n\nGlobal commercial aircraft heat transfer and fluid management system market in narrow-body aircraft segment\n\nThe aircraft heat transfer and fluid management system market is primarily driven by the growing procurement of narrow-body aircraft across the globe. Narrow-body aircraft, which is also referred to as single-aisle aircraft, has only one aisle in the cabin with the passenger seating arrangement divided into two axial groups. The demand for narrow-body is primarily being reflected owing to the increasing popularity of no-frill services or low-cost carriers (LCC) in many emerging and developed economies.\n\nAccording to Avimanyu Basu, a lead aerospace research analyst from Technavio, \"Major aircraft OEMs, like Boeing and Airbus, have planned to revamp their respective aircraft production programs, considering the growing demand in the narrow-body aircraft segment. In 2016, Airbus announced its plan to produce around 60 aircraft units of the A320neo family by 2020. Boeing aims to elevate its 737 MAX productions to 57 units per month by the same targeted period as Airbus.\"\n\nGlobal commercial aircraft heat transfer and fluid management system market in wide-body aircraft segment\n\nA wide-body aircraft can accommodate two passenger aisles within the fuselage, enabling it to feature seven or more side-by-side seating arrangements. Such aircraft were originally designed to ensure increased efficiency and passenger comfort as well as superior cargo space. However, many airlines have reduced the extra passenger space for maximizing their overall revenue and profit margins over the years.\n\n\"Both Boeing and Airbus offer their respective series of wide-body aircraft under the large wide-body and medium wide-body segments. The demand for wide-body aircraft is not as much as narrow-body aircraft. However, with the changing dynamics of the global aviation industry, many operators are investing in the procurement of large and mid-sized wide-body aircraft to offer premium-class services to passengers,\" says Avimanyu.\n\nGlobal commercial aircraft heat transfer and fluid management system market in regional jet segment\n\nThe development of new-generation regional aircraft (both 20-59 seat and 60-99 seat segments) will drive the market growth for the global commercial aircraft heat transfer and fluid management system market in the regional jet segment. The increased importance of large regional jets will also become a valuable tool for network connectivity between secondary and tertiary airports across the globe.\n\nMature markets consisting of North America, Europe, and Northeast Asia (South Korea and Japan) will see a demand for airlines that operate fleets of aircraft with varying seating capacities. The entry of newer versions of regional jets will also propel the adoption of the advanced heat transfer and fluid management system in this segment during the forecast period.\n\nThe top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are:\n\nAMETEK Crane PARKER HANNIFIN UTC Unison\n\nBrowse Related Reports:\n\nGlobal Commercial Aircraft Seating Market 2017-2021 Global In-flight Entertainment Systems Market 2017-2021 Global Airport Information Systems Market 2017-2021\n\nAbout Technavio\n\nTechnavio is a leading global technology research and advisory company.

The giant plane-maker has been hoping to add a multibillion-dollar fighter-jet sale to its more than US$94 billion in annual revenues.\n\nBut it so happened this visit fell on the same day Boeing filed a trade action against Canada's largest aerospace player, the far smaller Bombardier. It also happened that the Canadian hosts were given little warning.\n\nWord filtered up to the top-floor office of ambassador David MacNaughton about an hour beforehand about the trade action, which this week resulted in whopping 220-per-cent preliminary duties on Bombardier sales.\n\n\"(MacNaughton) called them out of the meeting,\" one source said.\n\nTwo sources say the ambassador delivered a message similar to what's now the Canadian government's public mantra: \"I don't do business with people suing me,\" and, \"You shouldn't treat customers this way.\"\n\nThe Boeing people decided it was better to leave. The meeting was over.\n\nWhat the Canadian government has heard from Boeing is that the company is torn between two imperatives: completing the military sale with Canada and avoiding what it perceives to be a colossal mistake of its past.\n\nThe company has said this publicly.\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Marc Allen, president of Boeing's international division, said: \"We watched another competitor come up and enter the market in a very similar fashion.\"\n\nThat competitor was Airbus, in the 1970s.\n\nA consortium of French, German, and UK interests, Airbus started small in the US market, with European subsidies propping up its twin-engine and single-aisle planes. But the product lines, and the planes, grew, and by the 1990s the company had become a US giant in its own right, muscling aside smaller players like McDonnell Douglas.\n\nNow Airbus is aiming for 50% of the American market after opening its first jetliner plant in the US\n\nBoeing claims to fear a repeat. After Bombardier's sale of 75 mid-sized planes to Delta Air Lines, it launched a complaint based on Bombardier's various forms of assistance from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.\n\nNever mind that Boeing is by far the No. 1 recipient of US government subsidies. It drew US$14.4 billion in various forms of assistance since the 1990s according to the website Subsidy Tracker, far more than any other US company and far more than what Bombardier received. The US Export-Import bank is jokingly referred to in Washington as, \"the Bank of Boeing.\"\n\nAnd Boeing doesn't even make planes similar to those Bombardier sold Delta. One Washington critic, Dan Ikenson of the free-market Cato Institute, compares this to a snowplow maker suing a bicycle company.\n\nWhat matters is a smaller rival can grow, Boeing says.\n\nIt repeated that cautionary tale of Airbus several times during a day-long hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n\"Airbus in 40 years has an airplane now in every single market segment,\" said Raymond Conner, Boeing's vice-chairman.\n\n\"What Airbus did is they entered ... the smaller (plane market)... and then moved on from there... Today we are fighting for our lives to maintain upper 40s or 50% (market share). The impact is real and it sometimes takes many years to materialize.\n\n\"What (Airbus has) done in 40 years, we had to do in 100.\"\n\nWashington aeronautics consultant Richard Aboulafia says Boeing is making a grave error. It is antagonizing governments and companies in several countries, including the UK, where Bombardier has more than 3,000 employees, and angering big US buyer Delta.\n\nThat's not all.\n\nHe says it's harming itself in two other ways: jeopardizing future military contracts in those countries and stoking protectionist sentiment in an industry that relies on international trade.\n\nAnd Boeing might find out its efforts pointless in the end as the Department of Commerce duty could be overturned by the more historically neutral ITC, or by the U.S. domestic trade court, or other international panels.\n\n\"People said the entire Vietnam War was the triumph of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said.\n\n\"You could win a battle and then find yourself having outraged (everyone)... Can (Boeing make) an effective trade complaint? Yeah, probably. What are the second-order effects? Oh my dear God, that's a strategic question. (They'd) rather not think strategically.\"\n\nHe heaps scorn on the idea that this is the ghost of Airbus, stirring again.\n\nAboulafia said it's not the 1970s. The planes are different, the market is different and Canada's subsidies to Bombardier are nowhere close to as threatening as an international consortium being propped up by different countries.\n\nOf the attempt to draw parallels, he says: \"That's what you'd think if you had no sense of strategic history.\"", "Some 4,000 jobs are under threat in Northern Ireland because the US government has imposed tariffs on imports of Bombardier jets.\n\nTheresa May has strongly criticised the decision and the Government has warned that there could be counter-measures.\n\nSome are arguing that this episode shows us why Brexit is going to be a disaster.\n\nOthers claim it merely shows the perils of subsidies and protectionism.\n\nWho is right? What will happen next?\n\nAnd what lessons can we really draw from this business?\n\nSo what's actually happened?\n\nThe US Department of Commerce said on Tuesday that it will impose 220 per cent tariff on imports of 100-150 seat civil aircraft from Canada manufactured by the Canadian firm Bombardier.\n\nThis was in response to a petition from Boeing, a rival aircraft manufacturer to Bombardier, which claimed that the Canadian firm had received illegitimate public sector subsidies for the manufacture of the aircraft in question, the C-series regional jet.\n\nWhat has any of this got to do with Britain?\n\nBombardier is a Canadian headquartered firm. But it manufactures in other countries, including Britain, having acquired local firms. Bombardier's Queen's Island plant in Belfast makes the wings for the aircraft in question. Boeing also claims that the UK government unfairly subsidised that plant.\n\nIf the new US tariffs make the plane uneconomical (it could triple the cost) those jobs are obviously vulnerable.\n\nThe ruling could jeopardise a $5.6bn order from the US airline Delta for 125 C-series jets.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nThe US International Trade Commission will make a final decision in February 2018. This can be appealed in the US Court of International Trade. After that the Canadian government could try to bring action against the US in the World Trade Organisation.\n\nBut Canada is not waiting around for the legal process to run its course. The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to cancel a purchase of Boeing planes by his country in retaliation.\n\nAnd the UK Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, has also suggested a deal signed in 2016 for Boeing to supply 50 Apache helicopters to the British Army could being \"jeopardised\".\n\nHave there been unfair subsidies?\n\nThis is complicated. Setting up as an aircraft manufacturer is a massively expensive businesses. There are huge barriers to entry into this market. The reality is that there tends to be a symbiosis between governments and manufacturers in this sector.\n\nBoeing is generally able to rely on US government defence spending for a steady stream of funding, which helps to finance its development costs. This is similar to the way the UK aerospace and defence firm BAE Systems can generally rely on funds from UK government defence procurement programs.\n\nThe Canadian government has indeed given support to Bombardier for the development of its C-series. It's also true that the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive pledged investment to the Queen's Island site.\n\nBut both the Canadian and UK governments insist this support is compliant with World Trade Organisation rules on subsidies.\n\nThe UK support was permissible under EU rules since it was designed to promote regional economic development.\n\nBombardier says the US decision was actually the protectionist move and one \"divorced from the reality about the financing of multi-billion-dollar aircraft programmes\".\n\nDoes this tell us how weak we are outside the EU on trade?\n\nSimon Tilford of the Centre for Economic Reform believes so. He has noted that the EU and the US have been quarrelling about state support for Boeing and Airbus (the giant European aircraft manufacturer) for several decades but that this has never resulted in US tariffs on Airbus imports.\n\nHe sees this as partly a reflection of the commercial power of Europe: the US would not dare to slap tariffs on Airbus imports because it would be hit by serious counter-measures on Boeing exports to the massive EU market.\n\nMr Tilford thinks that the UK outside the EU will not have this commercial power in the eyes of Washington in similar disputes and when it comes to trying to do a new free trade with the US.\n\n\"This case gives us a real taste of how the UK will be treated in negotiations over a US-UK trade deal post-Brexit, and how vulnerable the country will be,\" he says.\n\nBut isn't this about Donald Trump's protectionist drive?\n\nTo some extent the Bombardier decision probably does reflect the change of personnel in the US administration. The US Commerce Secretary is Wilbur Ross, a strident protectionist businessman and financier appointed by Trump.\n\nSteve McGuire, a fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, points out that the United States has picked a fight with Canada, one of its closest allies and major trade partners. \"This, along with the nationalist tone of so much of Trump's pronouncements on trade, should disabuse the UK from any belief that the special relationship will insulate it from US action in the post-Brexit world,\" he says.\n\nBut whatever drove this particular decision the case and whatever lessons we might draw about how the UK would be treated outside the UK over trade, the Bombardier case is certainly a timely reminder of how damaging the sudden imposition of export tariffs can be for specific industries - and the severe knock-on impact on jobs.\n\nIf the UK crashes out of the EU in 2019 without a transition deal, UK-based car makers, for instance, would face 10 per cent tariffs on all car exports to Europe.\n\nWhen Theresa May says \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" - something she repeated after her Florence speech last week - is effectively saying that she is prepared for Britain and its exporters to face tariffs.\n\nThat should be of serious concern to anyone who works in those industries.\n\nMore about: Bombardier Northern Ireland Theresa May Donald Trump Wilbur Ross Reuse content", "The launch aid that was provided to Bombardier which came via Treasury is repayable on the basis of royalties from sales so it is effectively a loan.\n\nThroughout my time as Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) minister I am content that all transactions with Bombardier were consistent with European Union State Aid rules.\n\nIn the United States both cities and states give very substantial tax incentives and breaks to Boeing and other manufacturers.\n\nThe majority of the C Series aircraft, by value, is actually produced in the US like the engine and avionics to name but two.\n\nWhat I see the core of this dispute being, given that Boeing did not even tender for the Delta Airlines contract, is an attempt by Boeing - and in Europe, Airbus - to suffocate Bombardier.\n\nIt is bully boy tactics.\n\nThe manufacturing of the C Series sees a dramatic increase in efficiency and a reduction in fuel consumption that would mean when oil prices rise the plane becomes much more significant.\n\nIt is not the current version of the plane that is the target - it is the long term project and what flows from it that has got Boeing in particular so aggravated.", "BANGKOK - Prayuth Chan-ocha's military government is looking to start construction of projects under a 1.5 trillion baht ($45 billion) investment plan before the country's possible return to democracy late next year.\n\nEnabling laws for the so-called Eastern Economic Corridor initiative should be in place by the end of 2017 to bolster investor confidence, and construction of some of the planned infrastructure could begin next year, Kanit Sangsubhan, the secretary-general of the office overseeing the plan, said in an interview.\n\n\"We're in a rush,\" Kanit said in Bangkok. \"We want to make sure everything is ready by the time the new government comes in.\"\n\nThe generals who seized power in 2014 view the eastern seaboard project as vital for wooing advanced industries and are adding railway, airport and port capacity, with plans for tax breaks to lure private-sector investment. One potential obstacle is the political risk that the next elected government could try to jettison the junta's programs -- something that would be harder to do if legislation is in place and projects are underway.\n\nThe Eastern Economic Corridor is part of the two-decade national strategy being crafted by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to bolster Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, according to Kanit.\n\nThe strategy will provide a master plan for future governments to follow, Prayuth said in July. Werachon Sukondhapatipak, a government spokesman, said in March the strategy is part of the constitution and legally binding on future administrations.\n\nWhile elections are possible by the end of next year based on the government's road-map, an exact date has yet to be announced.\n\nThe plan for the corridor calls for a $6 billion upgrade of U-Tapao International Airport, $6.7 billion investment in railways, $12 billion for new cities and hospitals, and $15 billion for industry. The government expects about 80 percent of overall investment to come from the private sector.\n\nIf bidding for some projects is completed by mid-2018, construction can start later in the same year, Kanit said.\n\nThe government is seeking to develop sophisticated industries such as robotics, aviation maintenance and digital technology in the corridor's three eastern provinces of Rayong, Chachoengsao and Chonburi.\n\nThe administration has courted companies such as Airbus SE, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to assess the corridor's potential. Earlier this month, it hosted hundreds of Japanese companies in Thailand to market investment opportunities.\n\nShares in Thai industrial estate developers Amata Corp. and WHA Corp. have rallied this year on speculation they could be beneficiaries of the push to develop the eastern seaboard.\n\nOne major challenge for bringing advanced industry to the corridor is a workforce skills deficit.

(And countless times during the online booking process and in the confirmation email.)\n\nAmerican really wants you to understand what you're getting -- and what you're not.\n\nOnline check-in was the same as usual with this exception: You don't get an advance seat assignment when you buy a basic economy ticket. Seats are assigned at check-in or at the gate. American allows you to pay for a better seat at check-in if one is available. United and Delta do not.\n\nI expected a crappy seat for my $49 one-way basic economy fare to Dallas and that's what I got: Seat 37 B, a middle seat at the very back of the plane. I could have bought a better seat for as little as $10 (an aisle a couple rows in front of my seat) but declined like a good bargain traveler. I also could have paid $37 for a middle seat in main cabin extra, American's extra-legroom section.\n\nIt's worth noting that paying for a better seat and a checked bag would have still put me way ahead of the price of a regular ticket on this last-minute flight. (There is not always a huge discrepancy between basic and regular economy, so shop carefully.)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I half expected my boarding pass to be branded with a scarlet \"B.E.\"\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: The fleet and hubs of American Airlines, by the numbers (story continues below)\n\nThe fleet and hubs of American Airlines Fullscreen The tail of an American Airlines Boeing 777 peeks out of a hangar at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Oct. 14, 2016.

(United's boarding passes do prominently say \"basic economy\" and have to be obtained at the airport if you aren't checking a bag so they can check the size of your carry-on.) My American boarding pass did note that I could only bring one carry-on that fits underneath the seat. And my boarding group was a dead giveaway that I was flying in the cheap seats: Group 9. That is American's last boarding group.\n\nI packed light for my one-night business trip -- not easy for a notorious overpacker -- and managed to fit in two outfits, an extra pair of shoes, my laptop, TSA-approved toiletries and a small purse into a bag that could go under the seat.\n\nI'll admit to being a little apprehensive that they would measure my carry-on and make me pay to check it, or that I would in some other way feel like a second-class passenger.\n\nMy concern was unfounded. At Phoenix airport, the words basic economy were never uttered at the gate. When I politely asked the agent if there might be a last-minute aisle seat, she said only middle seats were available but she would add my name to a list in case something came open. She only asked my name, not the type of ticket I bought.\n\nThe only hint that basic economy is different was three reminders that passengers in boarding Group 9 could only have one small carry-on that fits under the seat. That's one item total, including purses and laptop bags. Anything else would have to be checked for the usual bag fee plus a penalty. (They didn't announce the price but the gate fee is $25.)\n\nI didn't see anyone approach the counter but during Group 9 boarding the man behind me, a small lunch cooler slung over his shoulder, was on the phone complaining about having to pay to check a large carry-on. (Non-basic economy passengers were offered complimentary gate checks of their carry-on bags as bin space filled up.)\n\nBoarding began at 6:20 a.m. for the 6:50 a.m. flight, and Group 9 started boarding at 6:39 a.m.\n\nA few minutes before that, the gate agent called my name. (I pay for my own travel and never announce I'm a travel reporter.) She had an open aisle seat. It was in the last row, 37, across the aisle from my assigned middle seat, next to the galley. The seat didn't recline but I was thrilled to be on the aisle.\n\nAs I made my way to the back of the Boeing 757, a sweet flight attendant named Evan saw my small bag and pointed to an open spot in a bin if I wanted to tuck it there. She didn't scan my ticket for basic economy or seem to give a lick about what I paid for my flight. I needed my laptop near my seat so I thanked her and moved on.\n\nAs I approached my seat, I saw another small open spot in the overhead bin in front of me. I grabbed my laptop and headphones and stashed my black shoulder bag there.\n\n\"Are you a scofflaw?'' my boss asked when I told her.\n\nNope. American and United have quietly said from the start that no one is going to police you once you're on board if -- and it's a big if -- there's space left when basic economy passengers board. They only flag big carry-ons when you board.\n\nI certainly would have survived in a middle seat with my bag underneath the seat -- and may have to on my return flight -- but it was nice to sit on the aisle and have more room to stretch my legs.\n\nWould I buy a basic economy ticket again? For the price -- a fraction of the regular fare in this case -- an unequivocal yes.\n\nDawn Gilbertson is a travel reporter at The Arizona Republic.

Airbus has also been developing its own vertical take-off and landing craft (VTOL) strategy through its Vahanna project, and it's become an area of focus for investors and engineering training in the world of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe new program likely won't be the last of its kind, but it will be interesting to see what kinds of startups form around this opportunity given that the timeline for putting autonomous aircraft to work in a commercial capacity at scale, profitably, seems quite a long ways out.", "Bombardier calls 220% U.S. duty on CSeries 'absurd,' says real fight now begins\n\nAn awkward encounter above Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue last spring provided early evidence of a rift between the Canadian government and the world's largest aerospace company.\n\nRepresentatives of the Boeing Co., wound up hastily leaving a meeting at Canada's embassy after a tense conversation with the ambassador.\n\nThey had arrived to discuss business with the Canadian government. The giant plane-maker has been hoping to add a multibillion-dollar fighter-jet sale to its more than $94 billion US in annual revenues.\n\nBut it so happened this visit fell on the same day Boeing filed a trade action against Canada's largest aerospace player, the far smaller Bombardier. It also happened that the Canadian hosts were given little warning.\n\nWord filtered up to the top-floor office of ambassador David MacNaughton about an hour beforehand about the trade action, which this week resulted in whopping 220-per-cent preliminary duties on Bombardier sales.\n\n\"(MacNaughton) called them out of the meeting,\" one source said.\n\nTwo sources say the ambassador delivered a message similar to what's now the Canadian government's public mantra: \"I don't do business with people suing me,\" and, \"You shouldn't treat customers this way.\"\n\nThe Boeing people decided it was better to leave. The meeting was over.\n\nWhat the Canadian government has heard from Boeing is that the company is torn between two imperatives: completing the military sale with Canada and avoiding what it perceives to be a colossal mistake of its past.\n\nThe company has said this publicly.\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Marc Allen, president of Boeing's international division, said: \"We watched another competitor come up and enter the market in a very similar fashion.\"\n\nThat competitor was Airbus, in the 1970s.\n\nA consortium of French, German, and U.K. interests, Airbus started small in the U.S. market, with European subsidies propping up its twin-engine and single-aisle planes. But the product lines, and the planes, grew, and by the 1990s the company had become a U.S. giant in its own right, muscling aside smaller players like McDonnell Douglas.\n\nNow Airbus is aiming for 50 per cent of the American market after opening its first jetliner plant in the U.S.\n\nBoeing claims to fear a repeat. After Bombardier's sale of 75 mid-sized planes to Delta Air Lines, it launched a complaint based on Bombardier's various forms of assistance from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.\n\nNever mind that Boeing is by far the No. 1 recipient of U.S. government subsidies. It drew $14.4 billion US in various forms of assistance since the 1990s according to the website Subsidy Tracker, far more than any other U.S. company and far more than what Bombardier received. The U.S. Export-Import bank is jokingly referred to in Washington as, \"the Bank of Boeing.\"\n\nAnd Boeing doesn't even make planes similar to those Bombardier sold Delta. One Washington critic, Dan Ikenson of the free-market Cato Institute, compares this to a snowplow maker suing a bicycle company.\n\nWhat matters is a smaller rival can grow, Boeing says.\n\nIt repeated that cautionary tale of Airbus several times during a day-long hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n\"Airbus in 40 years has an airplane now in every single market segment,\" said Raymond Conner, Boeing's vice-chairman.\n\n\"What Airbus did is they entered ... the smaller (plane market)... and then moved on from there... Today we are fighting for our lives to maintain upper 40's or 50 per cent (market share). The impact is real and it sometimes takes many years to materialize.\n\n\"What (Airbus has) done in 40 years, we had to do in 100.\"\n\nWashington aeronautics consultant Richard Aboulafia says Boeing is making a grave error. It is antagonizing governments and companies in several countries, including the U.K., where Bombardier has more than 3,000 employees, and angering big U.S. buyer Delta.\n\nThat's not all.\n\nHe says it's harming itself in two other ways: jeopardizing future military contracts in those countries and stoking protectionist sentiment in an industry that relies on international trade.\n\nAnd Boeing might find out its efforts pointless in the end as the Department of Commerce duty could be overturned by the more historically neutral ITC, or by the U.S. domestic trade court, or other international panels.\n\n\"People said the entire Vietnam War was the triumph of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said.\n\n\"You could win a battle and then find yourself having outraged (everyone)... Can (Boeing make) an effective trade complaint? Yeah, probably. What are the second-order effects? Oh my dear God, that's a strategic question. (They'd) rather not think strategically.\"\n\nHe heaps scorn on the idea that this is the ghost of Airbus, stirring again.\n\nAboulafia said it's not the 1970s. The planes are different, the market is different and Canada's subsidies to Bombardier are nowhere close to as threatening as an international consortium being propped up by different countries.\n\nOf the attempt to draw parallels, he says: \"That's what you'd think if you had no sense of strategic history.\"", "Colombian Aviation Industry Corporation (Corporaci\u00f3n de la Industria Aeron\u00e1utica Colombiana: CIAC) and the Colombian Air Force plan to use their locally developed IRIS unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototype as a sort of research system and not take it into production.\n\nThe state-owned CIAC test flew its IRIS in 2011, but the aircraft used heavy materials and UAV development is changing quickly, so it has moved on to another project: a joint effort with Airbus for a potential Atlante+ UAV, Colonel Alexander Pena, CIAC's sub-director and interim general manager, told reporters in Bogota on 26 September.\n\nColombia's air force and state-run CIAC plan to use the IRIS UAV as a test and development asset rather than for operations.

Sales to date have been restricted largely to its home market because it has yet to be certified by regulators in the United States and Europe.\n\nThursday's flight was the second for the initial C919 test model, whose maiden flight was on May 5.

COMAC did not immediately reply to questions from Reuters on whether the flight was shorter than planned.\n\nBradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher and reporter at Aviation Week, said the five-month interval between the aircraft's two flights was \"extraordinary\" and COMAC's reported delivery target of 2020 appeared not to be firm.\n\n\"The conclusion must be that COMAC was not really ready for flight testing in May,\" Perrett said in an article published on Wednesday. \"A common view is that the C919 was put into the air so early for strictly political reasons, although there is no suggestion that doing so was unsafe.\"\n\nMitsubishi Heavy Industry Industries Ltd's <7011.T>, Mitsubishi Regional Jet - Japan's first passenger aircraft - took its second flight eight days after it first flew in 2015 while the gap between the first and second flight for the Airbus A350 was five days, Perrett said.\n\nStrongly backed by China's government, COMAC has so far announced orders for 730 C919 planes from 27 customers, many of which are Chinese leasing companies.\n\nThough billed as homemade, the C919 relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric Co <GE.N>, France's Safran SA <SAF.PA>, Honeywell International Inc <HON.N> and United Technologies Corp <UTX.N>.\n\nCOMAC also said its ARJ21 regional jet was in the air at the same time as the C919 on Thursday, marking the first time two types of domestically made passenger jets have taken to China's skies simultaneously. REUTERS", "DUBLIN, September 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nThe \"Global C4ISR Systems Market - Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2021: Focus on Platforms and Application \" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.\n\nThe C4ISR systems market captured a market value of $90.67 billion in 2016 with land based systems accommodating the highest share.\n\nC4ISR systems have emerged as one of the vital elements of the defense forces across the globe. The major components of C4ISR systems include command and control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. Nowadays, data collection from the battle field and war sensitive zone has become a preliminary part of defense and border security forces. This data is collected in the form of electronic imagery or video recording with the help of drones or military satellites and then it is analyzed through intelligence systems to formulate the strategy during combat. C4ISR systems provide advantages such as real time data collection, swift and secure communication, and battle space awareness, among others.\n\nThe demand for C4ISR systems is rapidly gaining traction among defense forces across the globe. The key factors that largely supplement the growth of C4ISR systems market include improved situational awareness, increase in the demand of advanced mobile command systems, and rise in the allocation of defense budget for the development of advanced electronic systems in prominent countries.\n\nLarge share of revenue in C4ISR systems market is contributed by Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) applications. The high share of these applications is mainly attributed to the rise in demand of enhanced surveillance systems for tracking terrorist activities and border patrolling. Besides that, increase in the demand of electronic warfare systems is also anticipated to propel the growth of C4ISR systems market.\n\nNorth America is expected to dominate the market during the forecast period which is followed by Asia Pacific, Europe and Rest of the world. The U.S. being the largest military spender, is expected to procure and develop advanced C4ISR systems for its military missions which will result in high revenue generation during the forecast period. Similarly, Asia Pacific is expected to grow with the highest CAGR with China dominating the market in this region.\n\nSome of the key manufacturers in the C4ISR systems market include Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, The Boeing Company, Northrop Grumman, Israel Aerospace Industries ltd., BAE Systems, Raytheon, Inc., Rheinmetall Group, Harris Corporation, Airbus Defence and Space, Leonardo DRS, Elbit Systems, Thales Group, L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., and Saab Group.\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n1 Research Scope & Methodology\n\n1.1 Scope of the Report\n\n1.2 C4ISR Systems Market Research Methodology\n\n2 Market Dynamics\n\n2.1 Market Drivers\n\n2.1.1 Improved Situational Awareness with C4I Systems\n\n2.1.2 Increasing Defense Spending by Asia Pacific Nations\n\n2.1.3 Growing Need for Intelligence and Surveillance Systems\n\n2.2 Market Challenges\n\n2.2.1 Increasing Reliance on Information Technology\n\n2.2.2 Interoperability Issues\n\n2.3 Market Opportunities\n\n2.3.1 Growing Demand for COTS Systems\n\n2.3.2 Growing Opportunities for Cyber Security Solution Providers\n\n2.3.3 Growing Market for Space-based C4ISR Systems\n\n3 Competitive Insights\n\n3.1 Competitive Landscape\n\n3.2 Key Strategies and Developments\n\n3.2.1 Partnerships, Agreements and Contracts\n\n3.2.2 Product Launches\n\n3.2.3 Mergers and Acquisitions\n\n3.2.4 Other Developments\n\n3.3 Competitive Benchmarking\n\n3.4 Market Share Analysis\n\n4 Industry Analysis\n\n4.1 C4ISR Product Mapping with Key Manufacturers\n\n4.2 Leading Programs for C4ISR Systems\n\n4.3 Value Chain Analysis\n\n4.4 Industry Attractiveness\n\n4.4.1 Threat of New Entrants\n\n4.4.2 Threat of substitutes\n\n4.4.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers\n\n4.4.4 Bargaining power of buyers\n\n4.4.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry\n\n5 Global C4ISR Systems Market, 2017-2021\n\n5.1 Assumptions and Limitations\n\n5.2 Market Overview\n\n6 C4ISR Systems Market by Application\n\n6.1 Market Overview\n\n6.2 Command and Control\n\n6.3 Communication\n\n6.4 Computers\n\n6.5 Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance\n\n6.6 Electronic Warfare\n\n7 C4ISR Systems Market by Platform\n\n7.1 Market Overview\n\n7.2 Land\n\n7.3 Airborne\n\n7.4 Naval\n\n7.5 Space\n\n8 C4ISR Systems Market by Geography\n\n9 Company Profiles\n\nAirbus S.A.S BAE Systems Elbit Systems General Dynamics Corporation Harris Corporation Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) L-3 Technologies Leonardo DRS Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Raytheon Inc.

Here's what's on our radar at the moment:\n\nBombardier's fight is just beginning\n\nWhen the United States Department of Commerce announced it would be imposing a 219% tax on jets built by Canadian aerospace giant Bombardier on Tuesday night, the outcry was swift. While imposing some sort of duty wasn't a complete surprise; its size, however, was. U.S. plane manufacturer Boeing, which had initially complained that Bombardier was benefitting from unfair subsidies by the Canadian government, had only asked for an 80% levy.\n\nYesterday Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland encouraged everyone to take a deep breath. The spat is serious, for sure -- coming in the midst of the sensitive NAFTA renegotiations isn't great timing -- but, she continued, it's not unprecedented:\n\n\"Look, I do want to remind Canadians that aggressive actions and aggressive decisions by Commerce are nothing new. They are certainly familiar to us from the softwood lumber dispute, and anyone who doubts that Commerce can be aggressive when it comes to the aerospace industry should give Airbus a call. This is familiar and accustomed behaviour. And, when it comes to Bombardier... this is just the first step in a much longer process.\"\n\nLink: Maclean's\n\nWhy Metro wants Jean Coutu\n\nFour years after grocer Loblaw Cos. bought drugstore Shoppers Drug Mart, rival Metro is following suit, making a bid for the Quebec-based pharmacy chain Jean Coutu. The proposed $4.5 billion merger is trying to achieve similar economies of scale and supply-chain efficiencies, but of course looming over all of it is the spectre of Amazon:\n\nThe potential deal sent both stocks soaring as it would tie up two giants from Quebec and give Metro an expanded foothold in the drug business, mirroring Loblaw Cos.' purchase of Shoppers Drug Mart four years ago. Jean Coutu's earnings had been under pressure due to new provincial regulation on generic drugs, though a compromise was recently found with the government. Canadian grocers, which were locked in a price war and are just coming out of a prolonged bout of food deflation, now have to get ready for Amazon, which in June agreed to buy Whole Foods Market Inc.

There's some inherent drama to buying a house: big sums of money, high emotional stakes, tense negotiations, simply tragic interior decor. But perhaps turning the housing market into a non-stop source of light entertainment could have unintended consequences:\n\nWe are supposed to be in rehab from our housing binge of ten years ago, the one that nearly bankrupted the country. We are supposed to be in a state of contrition. But our national love of HGTV suggests that the dream won't die. The longing it addresses is impervious to market corrections, or personal financial realities, and as economists continue to explore the true causes of the 2008 financial crisis, they are beginning to suspect that some speculative Americans acting on that longing got us into that mess as much as -- or more than -- unscrupulous bankers or Wall Street.

A self-enforced stoicism that had remained steady up to this point, was now being tested.\n\n\"This is a weapon in the cabin,\" I was being told forcefully by a Vietnamese security officer. He was holding up my compact camera tripod and examining it closely and with great suspicion.\n\n\"Sorry, what's the problem?\" I asked in the most innocent tone I could muster at this point of my journey, my eyes stinging from fatigue.\n\n\"You need to throw it. Or you go back and check it in,\" he sternly commanded.\n\nI was flying exclusively budget with no luggage allowance and no frills - all the way. After some attempted negotiations I was escorted back to the check-in counter to hand over US$40 for an item that weighed less than 1kg - and which would have cost me nothing to carry in the hold if I had been flying a full-fare airline.\n\nThis was not part of the plan. After landing in Ho Chi Minh City on a flight from Bangkok, I had attempted to use the transfer counter only to be denied flatly by a lethargic staff member and told to go through immigration and customs and then re-enter the airport.\n\nHence my midnight rendezvous with this safety-conscious officer.\n\nBy this point I had slept only intermittently, so headed towards the airport's \"sleeping boxes\": Brightly lit cubicles fitted with a simple mattress and charged at US$7 per hour. Everything about them, particularly the lack of darkness normally associated with sleeping would have been unattractive to a less exhausted passenger. In my case, I could not have handed over the cash faster.\n\nAs I waited for my delayed, early morning flight, there was some kind of perfect storm brewing, at least in my own frazzled mind. And it was the low point of what ended up being a 90-hour budget airline marathon, across six countries and 10 different airports.\n\nThese airlines, now so dominant in Southeast Asia, have opened up the skies and radically transformed the way people travel. The experience of flying today is nothing like it once was.\n\nI took 11 flights in total, slept in transit lounges and on benches, showered twice, connected to a silly number of lumbering free Wi-Fi networks and developed an unhealthy relationship with Starbucks.\n\nComfort and experience for travellers comes a distant second to the forces of business in the aviation industry. But do we as travellers actually mind? And does it matter?\n\nOne of the things I eventually understood during my journey is that the frustration and delay I endured in Ho Chi Minh City is not inevitable, but nor was it unexpected. In the end I got what I paid for: I arrived at my destination.\n\nAnd the low-cost model has made flying a reachable aspiration for millions of people.\n\nWhen the bright red AirAsia Airbus did pull in that morning, a comical moment certainly relieved some of my anguish.\n\nIn a near empty plane, three of us - taller than average men - found each other huddled together while most of the rows around us had been left empty.\n\nWhile advised to stay in our allocated seats, the absurdity of the arrangement eventually meant the service staff turned a blind eye when the man to my left made his move to a row slightly further up the plane.\n\n\"Come up to the business class,\" he shouted back, laughing.\n\nI smiled, put on my headphones and tried to sleep as we noisily barrelled towards Kuala Lumpur. I still had about 60 hours of this to go.\n\n1. Changi is always a pleasure\n\nTurn the clock back to the previous Sunday and I was geared up for my first flight, leaving from Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh. The kingdom's airport is handy, modern and seldom crowded, a stark outlier in a city defined by its chaotic roads and dusty skies.\n\nThe same convenience applies to Singapore's Changi Airport, which regularly wins awards for being the best airport in the world.\n\nI know the airport well. But I suspected that I had made a mistake dropping in so early in my journey, still fresh-eyed and without the aching back and petulant attitude that would overcome me later. It is a complex that has mastered the art of providing an easy travel experience. It provided a stark comparison with what was to come.\n\nAfter landing at about 1am, I had plenty of time to test Changi's overnight offerings. As an airport that has been named the best for grabbing some shuteye by the Sleeping in Airports website, it was no surprise I managed to get some decent rest.\n\nAfter the bizarre feeling of starting my day inside the terminal, I met the man leading Singapore's low-cost efforts, the CEO of Scoot, Lee Lik Hsin.\n\nDressed in a yellow polo shirt and seated at a modest desk in the middle of Scoot's busy office in the basement of Terminal 3, Mr Lee is clearly at the fore of an austere push towards profitability for his growing network.\n\nScoot recently merged with and then enveloped Tiger Airways, a brand consolidation by owner Singapore Airlines that has created a much more formidable low-cost player boasting a raft of premium new aircraft.\n\n\"We do feel that we want to have that differentiation between everybody else,\" he told me.\n\n\"The industry model has changed. It's no longer the bad old budget airlines of the past, leaving you stranded. We all take care of our customers.\n\n\"It's a wonderful advantage being based out of Changi. It's really in the area of connecting passengers that Changi gives us an edge to be better than other connecting hubs in the region.\"\n\nWith their bright ambitions and newly created words - Scootitude, Scootpons and Scootalogues - swirling in my mind, I move onto the second flight. Bangkok is my next stop.\n\nA thunderstorm was brewing maliciously over the Thai capital and the rumblings through the cabin made some people nervous.\n\n\"Scared, scared, scared,\" a passenger behind me murmured. Next to me, a woman in her 20s tightly gripped the armrest as the cabin seemed to buckle in the angry atmosphere.\n\nThankfully, the pilot did not announce the need for mass prayers to save the plane from impending doom, as happened on a recent budget flight out of Perth, and we landed without incident.\n\nSuch heavy storm clouds are building up over some of Asia's legacy carriers.\n\nThe old firms - premium airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific - are watching their long-time dominance of the skies come under threat from rivals in the Arab Gulf, while the explosion of low-cost providers is undercutting the regional market and disrupting the traditional notion of stopover hubs.\n\nFlying point-to-point is widely seen as the future for Southeast Asia, where most flights are no longer than a couple of hours.\n\nIt means profits are on the wane for the premium providers. \"It's quite clear that growth in the budget segments of the business is going to be at a higher rate than the full service parts of the business,\" Mr Lee sad.\n\nIt also means the race to dominate the seemingly countless new route possibilities is red hot.\n\nThe best part of that for travellers is the possibility of flying pretty much anywhere you want in Southeast Asia without having to transit through one of the major hubs, like Singapore or Bangkok. The problem is everyone is doing it, and the infrastructure is groaning under the pressure.\n\nChangi's new Terminal 4 is transitioning towards automation and new technology to further streamline the passenger experience, which will notably include those flying AirAsia, one of the airlines finding a new home at T4.\n\nIts new capacity is also critical as Singapore looks to maintain its longstanding status as a transit hub, while other cities like Manila and Jakarta struggle to accommodate the rising number of flights on offer.\n\nIn Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi Airport is seriously overcrowded, according to the International Air Transport Association, and could pose imminent safety risks without urgent expansion.\n\nWhile many low-cost airlines are serviced by Don Mueang Airport on the other side of town, some of them linger at the newer Suvarnabhumi. One of those is VietJet, an aggressive new player with fast expansion ambitions.\n\nTheir prices are cutthroat and marketing campaigns bold: Its bikini-clad flight attendants have caused plenty of controversy.\n\nNothing so racy occurred on my flight from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City. It all felt rather mundane: There was a one-hour delay and there seemed little to differentiate VietJet from its rivals, apart from what seemed to be the unexpected and unconventional yelling of the safety instructions.\n\nIf you want to fly cheaply in Southeast Asia, it is quite difficult to avoid AirAsia. I wanted to sample a variety of airlines but found myself constantly drawn back to the region's rising giant again and again, due to its sheer ubiquity in the region.\n\nAirAsia has more than 300 routes to 127 destinations. Much of that revolve around their Kuala Lumpur home base, KLIA2, my next stop. From here, 220 flights take off daily.\n\nThis sprawling network is the aggressive business model of group CEO Tony Fernandes. The company's slogan is \"Now everyone can fly\", and Fernandes seems intent on being the one to enable them.\n\nKLIA2 is a modern operating airport with all the normal things you might expect inside: The same duty-free stores, the same cookie-cutter signage, the same high-end fashion boutiques. It is like another planet compared to the city's previous low-cost terminal, which ceased operations in 2014. That place was grim.\n\nBut when I sat down to chat with him, it was clear Mr Fernandes thinks what he has now is far too lux - and expensive - for his business.\n\n\"It wasn't the airport we wanted and we continue this battle,\" he said. \"We want governments to realise that there are two types of terminals. There's a low-cost airport and a full-service one.\"\n\nHe is pragmatic, though, and sees the importance of value and utility for passengers. No one needs niceties if they can fly internationally for US$20, he argued. And the same attitude applies to his aircraft.\n\nMr Fernandes is known to speak his mind and has called some of his rivals \"Mickey Mouse\" airlines in the past. He welcomes competition but reserves criticism for what he calls \"defensive\" tactics in the industry, such as Singapore Airlines' low-cost ventures.\n\n\"Airlines, because they've been monopolies, are scared to lose any sort of control. Singapore Airlines has had a bad run because it's tried to do too many things. It should focus on what it's good at. It's a good premium product.\n\n\"You don't get Rolls-Royce trying to start a budget car company.\"\n\nScoot's Mr Lee shrugged off that criticism, retorting: \"I guess we have to prove that we can be good at many things.\"\n\n4. The airport is still a mostly awful experience\n\nIt was about 5am when I arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Ho Chi Minh City. My next flight was in five hours so I staggered down to a capsule hotel and paid for some darkness and quiet away from the perpetually neon-lit wings of the airport world. As I continued my journey, I realised natural light is a vastly underrated feature of quality terminals.\n\nSometimes it seemed as if oxygen in the airports I passed through was laced with some kind of sedative. People walked around the halls like zombies, at all times of the day.\n\nBut perhaps that is a self-imposed condition, to allow one to tolerate the relentless queues that are part and parcel of the modern airport experience, with the increasing number of budget airline passengers adding even more waiting time.\n\nStill, queuing is what we have been trained to do and highlighted to me that the airport experience itself greatly influences whether travel is enjoyable or not. Standing in a line is not enjoyable.\n\nAirAsia almost operates in its own ecosystem and Mr Fernandes is keen on streamlining what is currently a painful process: The check in.\n\n\"I think the airport experience is not a great experience. I'm a big fan of pre-approval so you don't have to stand long in queues. I think security can be a much better experience. For 1 or 2 per cent of people, we all have to go through a nightmare,\" he said.\n\nDelayed flights are one of the inevitabilities of this business, it seems. My domestic flight to Langkawi was running 90 minutes late, meaning I needed to scramble through the mercifully small holiday-themed terminal upon landing to make my next flight to Penang.\n\nAfter bizarrely needing to pay some small cash to an airport staff member for a \"counter fee\", I was ushered through to the small gate and back out to the tarmac to walk to the next flight.\n\nTight connections on different airlines are a risk in the budget airline world, as many of the cheapest tickets offer no option other than to buy another ticket if a flight is missed. And buying at the last minute will likely mean paying top dollar.\n\nFortunately, though, my flight leaving Penang was also delayed.\n\nUsing statistics from August, AirAsia's Malaysia fleet had an on-time rate of just 55.07 per cent, with an average delay of nearly one hour. Jetstar Asia fared better at 84.55 per cent, a similar score to Singapore Airlines for the month.\n\nThe reasons for delays are varied, from technical issues and weather problems, to overcrowded runway capacity and other infrastructure challenges. And while your budget air ticket may have no flexibility, it is advisable that you do.\n\nMy attempts at self-connecting - many low-cost carriers will not issue future boarding passes or transfer luggage - were fraught with risk and added stress to the journey.\n\nJakarta is the world's most delayed airport, according to FlightStats.com, with only about one-third of flights on time. And guess what? That is where I was headed next.\n\n6. Indonesia still feels like the wild west\n\nIndonesia has a fairly dire reputation when it comes to aviation, yet with its spread out archipelago and big stable of airlines, it is one of the most competitive markets in the region.\n\nThe country's airlines, however, consistently rank among the least safe in the world and some are still banned from flying into the European Union.\n\nBooking the next ticket to Bali was akin to a potluck - on this day there were six airlines offering a range of flights priced within US$5 of one another. The cheapest one-way was US$35 with Citilink, an airline originally established as the low-cost subsidiary of national carrier Garuda.\n\nLate last year, Citilink was embroiled in controversy when one of its pilots was found to be drunk before take-off, which resulted in the resignation of the company's CEO.\n\nBenny Butarbutar, Citilink's vice-president of corporate communication, told me that the negative perceptions of the industry are something they are striving to change.\n\n\"Citilink was basically built on the same standard as Garuda Indonesia, without some of the services that premium airlines have,\" he said.\n\nHe added that safety standards are improving and national infrastructure is slowly catching up to the flying boom Indonesia is witnessing. Yet even in Jakarta, the ageing terminals are clear to see and offer a travelling experience that falls short of the best that the region has to offer.\n\nStill, price is the main game here.\n\n\"I don't care,\" said fellow flyer Lukman when I asked about the poor reputation of some Indonesian airlines. \"Most of the local carriers have problems with punctuality and delayed flights.\n\n\"I know the risks because it's cheap but I still take it. Safety is important but accidents don't happen that much and it can happen to the premium ones too.\"\n\n7. The sky is lonely for the weary traveller\n\nSpeaking to Lukman was a rare experience for me. When you have spent days removed from reality and have instead been zooming through time zones, juggling boarding passes and in an endless loop of security checks, the lack of human interaction is striking.\n\nIn four days, I did not have a proper face-to-face conversation with a single person. Personal interactions were limited to muted pleasantries with airport staff and Starbucks attendants.\n\nThe passengers next to me on the flights were normally quick to hide themselves from conversation, glued to their phone screens or inflight food menus.\n\nI also withdrew to find friendship in podcasts.\n\nOnly at one stage does an elderly man next to me pipe up, not to exchange pleasantries, but to suggest I might like to move to another free row so he could have two seats to eat his lunch. I obliged.\n\nThe short nature of regional flying means few people seem willing to invest the effort to meet their neighbour, a reflection on the industry and the times we live in.\n\nAnd despite flying becoming a more regular activity for so many people, some behaviour seems puzzling: On nearly every flight I took, passengers had to be verbally warned to remain seated as the plane slowly taxied towards its gate.\n\nPerhaps the urge to escape the confines of the aircraft comes from a subconscious sense that increasingly crowded airports mean longer queues, and beating fellow passengers off the plane could see one reach passport control ahead of the masses.\n\n8. Flying has changed forever\n\nI woke from a slumber on a couch in one of the closed airport bars at Bali's Denpasar International. Immigration shuts down overnight so I had a few hours to wait before my 7am departure to Kuala Lumpur and then onwards home.\n\nMosquitoes had feasted on my face and hands, probably a more delicious meal than I had enjoyed over the past few days.\n\nOverall, I had very few major complaints about this marathon experience. Six out of 11 budget flights were delayed, the most by 90 minutes. The overall cost came in about US$700, a sum that was inflated by booking last-minute flights, which tend to be more expensive.\n\nBudget flying is the new reality for most people in Southeast Asia. All signs suggest that more efforts will go into providing more infrastructure and aircraft to fly us directly where people want or need to go.\n\nThe days of the \"bad old budget airlines\" might not be gone just yet, as Scoot's Lee Lik Hsin believes, but they are certainly numbered. The future low-cost product looks more likely to be even safer, efficient and comfortable than today.\n\nAs I went through the final international security check, I was filled with some kind of strange feeling of accomplishment. Not of having gone anywhere or seen anything, but still, this was the final leg. I was just a few hours from home.\n\nBut I had just one more obstacle and it was a familiar one.\n\n\"Sir, can you open your bag please?\" I look up at the security officer with slow rising disbelief, my eyes bloodshot and face covered in bug bites.", "Curtis Ellis is a political communications consultant and writer.\n\nInternational trade and \"the tariff\" have always been messy issues in America's history, pitting competing interests against each other.\n\nBritain sparked the first tea party by lowering the tariff on tea from the British East India Company in order to undersell the leaf Boston merchants were selling. The British thought \"everyday low prices\" would win the day, but Americans sided with their countrymen's businesses, even if it meant paying more, and Boston Harbor entered the Guinness Book of Records as largest teapot in history.\n\nThe following century, the \"Tariff of Abominations\" sparked the first nullification crisis. Northern states wanted to protect their budding industries against low-priced imports. The South preferred buying cheaper goods from Britain, a practice that had the added benefit of providing Britain with money to purchase Southern plantation cotton. (The relationship between free trade and slave trade has always been a close one.)\n\nAs if to underscore the historical contentiousness of trade issues, the \"bombs bursting in air\" immortalized in our national anthem were ignited in the War of 1812. That war was fought over international trade and itself set off a \"30-year tariff war\" in Congress between Northern and Southern interests.\n\nThe latest battles over trade are in the skies, and so far the bombs bursting in air are only metaphorical.\n\nOne of the disputes pits the Big Three U.S. airlines - Delta, American and United - against foreign carriers based in the Persian Gulf, and the arguments are as convoluted as ever.\n\nIn recent years, three Persian Gulf airlines - Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways - have stepped up their flights to and from their Mideast hubs to American cities.\n\nThe Big Three American carriers are not happy. They say it's not fair they have to compete against airlines they claim are subsidized by the oil-rich governments of Dubai, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. They want Washington to freeze new flights into the U.S. and roll back the number of existing flights.\n\nThe American airlines are invoking Buy American and Hire American in their efforts to enlist U.S. government support in their battle.\n\nHere's where it gets messy.\n\nBoeing is America's largest exporter and the sole manufacturer of commercial aircraft.\n\nThey face stiff competition from foreign manufacturers such as Airbus and Bombardier.\n\nThe competition is not exactly fair. The European Union subsidizes Airbus to the tune of $10 billion a year. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross just slapped a 219 percent tariff on Bombardier jets in retaliation for Canadian government subsidies to the aeronautics manufacturer.\n\nWhen it comes to landing rights, the Big Three like to portray themselves as defenders of the Buy American faith. When it comes to the equipment they fly, it's another story.\n\nUnited Airlines just made a $45 billion deal to replace their Boeing aircraft - with Airbus jets!\n\nAnd Delta, too, passed on Boeing, choosing instead to buy 125 aircraft - from Bombardier!\n\nMeanwhile, the three Persian Gulf carriers have over 350 Boeing aircraft, worth some $130 billion, in the air and on order.\n\nIf the U.S. carriers were serious about standing up for Americans, they would put their money where their mouth is and Buy American aircraft.", "Agreement covers majority of components for the Parker-designed A350 fuel, hydraulic, and fuel tank inerting systems\n\nLONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Parker Aerospace, a business group of Parker Hannifin Corporation, the global leader in motion and control technologies, is announcing an agreement with Lufthansa Technik for long-term collaboration for Airbus A350 component maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services.

But many of those crafts are still in the early design stages.\n\nThe latest company to debut its designs for a flying machine is Passenger Drone, which emerged from a three-year-long stealth mode to show off its two-seater prototype. The craft is slightly bigger than a small car and boasts 16 individual electric engines and rotors for zero-emissions air travel.\n\nThe start-up has an edge on some of its bigger and better-known competitors, which include established companies like Airbus and Uber. Unlike many other VTOL designs, Passenger Drone has lived up to its name, showing off footage of test flights with human passengers.\n\nThe company says the first manned flights took place in August. Human occupants were able to control the craft manually using a joystick and touchscreen panel, or to allow the computer to fly in autonomous mode. Passenger Drone estimates that the craft has a range of about 20 miles, with a top speed of 50 mph, according to Electrek.\n\nYou can check out some footage of the craft's maiden flight below.\n\nThe VTOL didn't go very high or travel far beyond its immediate area -- but the test flight was just a first step.\n\nAlong with automated and manual control options, Passenger Drone says the crafts can be remotely operated from great distances (like, EU to North America far) via a 4G network, as you might expect from a vehicle being billed as a drone.\n\nThe Passenger Drone prototype still has a ways to go before it's ready to autonomously zip around cities, however -- the company told Electrek it's planning to announce more information at next year's CES conference.\n\nPassenger Drone joins the like of Uber, which is aiming at a 2020 target to launch an autonomous eVTOL prototype, and the city of Dubai, which recently held the first unmanned test flight of the air taxi service slated for development over the next five years.", "TWA lives on in new WTC lounge, upcoming hotel Fullscreen The TWA Lounge's reception desk modeled after Jet Age city center TWA ticket counters created by iconic mid-century industrial designer Raymond Loewy.

American Airlines will pause its Los Angeles-Auckland service for longer this summer and Emirates ended an Auckland-Sydney service this year, cutting capacity across the Tasman.\n\nBut the summer still looks strong around the country and this will help push down prices.\n\nHouse of Travel commercial director Brent Thomas says the inbound tourism boom means aircraft have to be back-filled and this drives bargain airfares. He says his firm has double-digit growth in bookings compared to a year ago.\n\nThis reflected a buoyant economy, more choice of airlines and a tendency for travellers to take shorter but more frequent breaks in mid-haul destinations around the Pacific Rim.\n\nHe says Air New Zealand's $600 return deal today is an example of how low fares can go for promotional reasons, but overall prices are still trending down as aircraft become more efficient and with fuel prices at relatively low levels.\n\nDuring the past two years 11 new airlines flying 18 new routes had come to Auckland. Passengers through the airport rose from 17.5 million last year to 19.2 million the 12 months to August.\n\nTasker says there is a good pipeline of opportunity.\n\n\"That's from existing carriers expanding their operations and there will be new stuff.\"\n\nIn addition to the usual boost to seats during summer by most carriers, new aircraft and some year-round increases in the number of seats are coming to Auckland.\n\nThese include Thai Airways moving to daily flights using its brand new Dreamliner aircraft and Philippine Airlines upgauaging to an Airbus 254-seat A340, which will allow it to fly directly between Auckland and Manila non-stop rather than flying via Cairns.\n\nTasker says it is a sign Philippine Airlines is expanding its network and putting a \"stake in the ground\" in this market. Manilla is a growing hub that offers good connections.\n\n\"It's giving us another direct service into a South East Asian hub - that growth [for Auckland] over the last few years from South East Asia is something that hasn't come in spades.\"\n\nThe new non-stop service to Manila will add more than 14,000 seats to the route, increasing seat capacity by 22 per cent, and inject $13.6 million annually into the New Zealand economy.\n\nThai Airways' new plane is an example of improved aircraft coming into this market, Tasker says.\n\nThe Auckland-Bangkok route will add 65,000 seats to the route and inject $53m annually into the New Zealand economy, the airport estimates.\n\n\"Thailand is a popular holiday destination for Kiwis with more than 46,000 New Zealanders travelling there during the past year, with the majority of travellers being holiday makers.\"\n\nThe additional flights will provide further travel options for visitors from the United Kingdom, Europe, India and South East Asia who travel through Thai Airways' hub in Bangkok.\n\nAir New Zealand, the airport's single biggest customer, is putting extra flights on to Vancouver, Houston and Buenos Aires during summer ahead of a big expansion in flying to Bali and Hawaii from next autumn, where it faces fierce competition from Hawaiian Airlines.\n\nAir New Zealand announced in August it will fly almost 60,000 additional seats between Auckland and Honolulu from April to October next year, an increase of 75 per cent compared with this year.\n\nHawaiian Airlines has been flying here for more than four years and has countered the Air New Zealand move by adding two new flights, to its current three, from next March.\n\nAir New Zealand is also investigating new ultra-long-haul routes, including Chicago and destinations in South America.\n\nOn the non-stop route to the United States mainland, Air New Zealand's alliance partner United and rival American Airlines both paused their services during the past winter - leading to a 16 per cent drop in passengers last month compared to August last year - but are returning with bigger aircraft and flash new cabins over summer.\n\nUnited Airlines will operate a 777-300ER aircraft on its seasonal Auckland-San Francisco route when it recommences services from October 31, which features its new Polaris business-class product.\n\nThe move will add another 114 seats on each flight from the 787-9 aircraft originally scheduled, and as a result United is moving to six services a week from daily on the route, through to December 17 and then operate daily through to March 24.\n\nAmerican Airlines is having a longer winter pause next year but when it returns on October 6 will upgauge from a Boeing 787-8 to a larger 787-9 with extra capacity for both passengers and cargo.\n\nTasker says this summer will be the first that Emirates and Qatar are both flying for the duration of summer. Qatar entered the market half way through last summer and with both airlines flying for the entire peak season this opens up dedicated pipelines into Britain and Europe.\n\nChina remains strong with seven airlines flying to Auckland with a total of up to eight flights a day over summer.\n\n\"From a New Zealand tourism perspective we're seeing real diversification of markets - we have really capacity into the United States, Britain, Europe, South Asia, North Asia and across the Tasman,\" he says.\n\n\"We've got a whole lot of markets firing.

The airline has an all-Airbus A320 fleet.\n\n\"The launch of international operations will be through Airbus 320 aircraft and the airline, in the first year, will connect destinations within four hours of flying distance from India,\" said a person aware of the proposal.\n\n\"Mediumhaul and long-haul aircraft will be added subsequently, during the second and third year of operations.\"\n\nThat eligibility norm for overseas flights was amended in June last year to any airline with a fleet of 20 planes.

It employs more than 1,600 in Gresham, where it has engineered and machined parts for the company's 737, 737 MAX, 767, 777 and 787 jets.\n\nUS sides with Boeing on tariffs\n\nPilarski anticipates that in the negotiations with Canada over the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. trade officials will find a way to settle the case before tariffs are imposed.\n\n\"I really don't see it happening,\" Pilarski said.\n\nThe danger for the U.S. is in setting a precedent for rivals to treat American aerospace companies badly, he said.\n\nBy pushing the case before the U.S. International Trade Commission -- a forum that's unilateral and therefore clearly biased -- rather than before an international tribunal, Boeing will only encourage countries like China, Russia and Brazil that have big aerospace ambitions and large home markets to do the same to Boeing in the future, he said.\n\n\"You are giving your real competitors an excuse to say, if the U.S. can do this, we can do it,\" Pilarski said.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a prominent aviation analyst with the Teal Group, agreed, calling saying this week's ruling \"a tactical victory but strategically a disaster\" for Boeing.\n\nHe said the immediate harm to Boeing is the likely loss of big defense contracts from the two most reliable military allies of the U.S.\n\nThe Canadian government has already put on hold a $5.2 billion deal that was all but finalized for Boeing F/A-18 jet fighters and related weapons systems.\n\nThe Canadians are known to be interested also in buying P-8 anti-submarine jets and Chinook helicopters from Boeing. For now, those possibilities are off the table, too.\n\nAnd because the CSeries wings are made in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where 1,000 jobs are threatened, future U.K. defense buys are also at risk.\n\nAboulafia said the big winner from the Bombardier case may be Boeing's European rival Airbus, which could win airliner orders from Delta Air Lines if the U.S. carrier takes sufficient offense at the U.S. tariff blocking a planned delivery of 75 CSeries jets.\n\nAs for Bombardier, while at times it's been looked at askance by some Canadians outside its base in Quebec as a money pit undeserving of more government support, now national pride demands that Canada shore it up.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can market it personally, pointing potential buyers like the Chinese to clear evidence that it's a great airplane: Boeing is afraid of it.\n\n\"MORAL BANKRUPTCY\"\n\nPilarski is close to several top Boeing executives and has a long relationship with the company -- having started at the Douglas Aircraft Company, he worked for Boeing briefly after the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas.\n\nYet in an interview he was clearly pained at Boeing's tactics.\n\n\"This is letting a bully beat up others, in this case unnecessarily,\" he said. \"Bombardier is a niche player with a small domestic market. They'll produce in a year maybe what Boeing will produce in a month.\"\n\n\"It really hurts me to see this,\" he added. \"I'm an American. I know people at Boeing. It makes me ashamed. It's moral bankruptcy.\"\n\nBoeing's case against Bombardier is based on its receipt of government subsidies.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Bombardier received about $570 million in launch-aid loans from the governments of Canada, Quebec and the U.K., followed by a $1 billion equity investment in 2015 by the government of Quebec, which was granted a 49.5 percent share of the CSeries program.\n\nThe Commerce Department attributed147 percent of the total 220 percent tariff to that last billion-dollar investment.\n\nYet Pilarski dismisses that money as not an illegal subsidy but as a bailout of the company, which would have gone bankrupt otherwise.\n\nHe compared it to the multiple U.S. bailouts of its auto companies or, in aerospace, the 1979 federal bailout of Lockheed, all of which not only saved the companies involved but also resulted in the government getting its money back later.\n\nPilarski is also incensed that Boeing chose to rest its case on the sale of the CSeries to Delta -- a shaky argument because Delta was looking for a smaller plane than Boeing had and so the company didn't offer a jet in that competition.\n\nBoeing argued that Bombardier offered the CSeries planes to Delta at a lowball price, well below cost.\n\nPilarksi points out that this is the way all commercial-airplane manufacturers operate, including Boeing.\n\nNew airplanes, like the 787 Dreamliner, are sold at well below cost, especially to marquee customers who provide strategic sales momentum.\n\nAboulafia sees irony in the fact that Boeing claims a threat to its smallest new airplane, the 737 MAX 7.\n\nThat plane has indeed sold poorly. It has only two big customers, one of which is WestJet, of Canada, which has not yet taken delivery of the aircraft.\n\n\"Seriously?\" said Aboulafia. \"The prospect for retaliation (by Canada) is all too easy.\"\n\nPOLITICAL SOLUTION?\n\nThe future of the case may now lie more in the realm of politics than in the quasi-judicial proceedings underway at the Commerce Department and the ITC.\n\nThat process allows Commerce to negotiate with Canada a \"suspension agreement\" that would stave off the tariffs in exchange for concessions, which typically involve undertakings about future pricing.\n\nOf course, the political backdrop is President Trump's touting of an America First policy that promises to renegotiate existing trade deals. He has raised specific criticisms of Canada aside from the Bombardier case.\n\nWhen Boeing filed its petition against Bombardier with the ITC in April, just months after Trump took office, the timing suggested to some that Boeing saw advantage in the political environment and the cozy relationship Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has developed with Trump.\n\nYet Pilarski sees Trump as a possible way out.\n\nHe suggested that with the president's propensity to make transactional U-turns, Trump could \"step in as a benevolent dictator\" and come to an agreement that lets Bombardier off the hook while allowing him to go to Canada, sign a new NAFTA deal and seal the big F/A-18 jet fighter contract.\n\nThat's the alternative to the triggering of a trade war now and more in the future, Pilarski said.\n\nLate Thursday, Boeing chose not to add anything to the statement it issued after the Commerce ruling came down.\n\nThat statement said the ITC and Commerce process that will play out between now and February will follow its \"longstanding, transparent course.\"\n\n\"We have full confidence that this will continue to be a fair and fact-based investigation, and we look forward to its conclusion early next year,\" Boeing said.", "Chicago-based Boeing won a major victory against a foreign competitor earlier this week when the Commerce Department signaled its intent to impose a 219 percent tariff on Canadian-made jetliners, claiming aircraft maker Bombardier has been unfairly propped up by the Canadian government.\n\nBut critics of the decision say Boeing itself benefits from its own form of government support, which includes federal contracts and tax breaks from state governments in the United States - a reflection of how American corporations are also dependent on government policies, contracts, decisions and in some cases direct financial inducements in their attempts to remain internationally competitive.\n\n\"The truth is anybody who's in aerospace receives some type of subsidy, and certainly Boeing is no exception to that,\" said Darryl Jenkins, chairman of the American Aviation Institute, an independent think tank focusing on the commercial aviation industry.\n\nA large percentage of Boeing's business comes from defense contracts, of which the U.S. military is easily its largest customer.\n\nThe company's Arlington, Va.-based defense, space and security business reported close to $7 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. The Pentagon's 2017 budget called for buying seven more Apache helicopters, 12 F-18 Super Hornets and for V-22 Ospreys from the company.\n\nMany of these contracts also cover research and development expenses that can nurture new products, such as a $499 million deal to help the Air Force develop future air vehicles.\n\nIn some cases, the company gets tax breaks from state governments hoping to lure high-paying engineering jobs, such as an $8.7 billion tax break the company received from the state of Washington in exchange for setting up jobs there. Others argue that the U.S. Export-Import Bank indirectly facilitates Boeing's sales abroad, because the bank's loans effectively allow foreign airliners to purchase Boeing-made jets at a discount.\n\nAt the heart of the Commerce Department's proposed tariff is Bombardier's C series CS100 commercial jet, which seats about 100. Last year, Bombardier agreed to sell 75 commercial jetliners to Delta Air Lines in a multibillion-dollar deal.\n\nBoeing's objection to the deal mystified some. Boeing was not a competitor in Bombardier's bid for Delta's business last year and does not make a similar plane.\n\nSome saw it as a political move.\n\n\"The less savory aspect of this is it's a great chance for Boeing to find common ground with Donald Trump to please the economic nationalist wing of his base,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal Group, a firm that provides aerospace and defense analysis.\n\nA week before Tuesday's decision, Bombardier released a sharply worded statement titled \"Boeing's hypocrisy,\" linking to a Seattle Times article that detailed how Boeing has sold the 787 Dreamliner at a loss for years, in the hope that it eventually will make up the difference in future sales.\n\n\"It is pure hypocrisy for Boeing to say that the C Series launch pricing is a 'violation of global trade law' when Boeing does the same for its new aircraft,\" Bombardier said in its statement.\n\nBoeing rejected the comparison.\n\n\"It is simply inappropriate to equate the billions in subsidies Bombardier and companies like Airbus have received with state-level investment incentives and export credit agencies like the Export-Import Bank, to which Boeing's customers currently do not have access,\" the company said Tuesday.\n\nOfficials at the Commerce Department described the duty as an effort to level the playing field.\n\n\"The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. \"The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\"\n\nThe size of the tariffs raised eyebrows. Such a large tariff is exceedingly rare for a multimillion-dollar item like a jet plane. If the U.S. government follows through with the tariff, it would more than triple the price for customers inside the United States, costs that would be passed through to the supplier.\n\n\"I've never seen one this big on this expensive of a product,\" said Jenkins, the AAI chairman. \"The tariff makes the price completely unreasonable.\"\n\nThe attention-getting size of the tariff could be a bargaining chip to win trade concessions as the government moves through the process of finalizing the duty. The Commerce Department did not specify what subsidies Bombardier received that it considered improper, only citing support from the governments of Canada, Britain and the provincial government of Quebec in calculating its decision.\n\nThe alleged subsidies could include hundreds of millions of dollars in loans Bombardier has received from the Canadian government over its C series aircraft for years, most recently a $372.5 million interest-free loan announced in February 2017. Last year the company received a $1 billion investment from the Quebec provincial government related to the C series plane.\n\nBritish and Canadian leaders have said the dispute would damage Boeing's chances to win defense contracts with their respective governments.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounded the alarm last week, saying his government might cancel a previous proposal to buy Boeing F-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.\n\nNews of the tariff sparked dismay in Britain, where Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to maintain the country's economic advantage as it prepares to divorce itself from the European Union as part of the Brexit process.\n\nBombardier employs about 4,000 people in Belfast, many of whom work on the CS100.\n\nMay's office tweeted that it was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the Tuesday evening ruling.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday in Belfast, British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said he would not cancel an existing deal to buy eight spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters from Boeing, but said the slight would hurt Boeing in future competitions, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\n\"This is not the behavior we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardize our future relationship with them,\" Fallon said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nStill others are worried that Bombardier will become an example to other foreign firms thinking of setting up shop in the United States, adding a tinge of uncertainty to the broader U.S. business climate.\n\n\"Any resurgence of 'made in America' is going to depend on our ability to attract foreign firms to set up shop here,\" said Nancy McLernon, president and chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a nonprofit group that advocates for open markets.", "GENEVA * The United States surprised a meeting of the World Trade Organization on Friday with an interpretation of dispute settlement rules some said was a bid to boost President Donald Trump's plans to reform the global body. Its view, expressed by the U.S. WTO representative, was seen as opening the door for individual member states to block appeals rulings in certain cases, undermining a trade dispute system that is highly regarded by many trade experts.\n\n\"It's power politics,\" one trade diplomat who attended the meeting said.\n\nUnder the WTO's arcane rules, the global trade body has seven appeals judges, three of whom sign off on each trade dispute appeal ruling.\n\nThe current problem is that two of the seven judges have left in recent months and another has a term that expires in December, which will leave only four.\n\nThe United States has been blocking recruitment of new appeals judges for several months, exacerbating the risk that the WTO could effectively run out of judges, and piling pressure on other WTO members to accept U.S. plans for reform.\n\nAt Friday's meeting, the U.S. representative said two of the judges in a recent dispute between Indonesia and the European Union had left by the time their ruling was published, so their ruling would only be official if there was unanimous agreement at the meeting.\n\nThe United States did not object in this instance, citing \"particular and exceptional circumstances,\" but said there should normally be \"positive consensus\" at the meeting to adopt a ruling with too few judges, according to a written U.S. statement provided to Reuters.\n\n\"I think it's the first time somebody said you need positive consensus. It means that any member can block the whole thing,\" said the trade diplomat who was in the meeting.\n\nThe already congested system is facing a huge backlog of work, and a risk that there will not be enough judges to rule on appeals in disputes such as the long-running spat over subsidies for planemakers Boeing and Airbus.\n\nEarlier this week China's ambassador to the WTO, Zhang Xiangchen, said he was concerned that the dispute settlement system and other basic functions of the WTO were at risk from trade protectionism.\n\n\"Frankly speaking, the WTO is experiencing the most difficult time,\" Zhang told a panel discussion.\n\n\"And some even challenge the existing rules in the dispute settlement mechanism. Of course any mechanism needs to keep pace with the times and be constantly improved. But if the core values, the fundamental principles are abandoned, the organization will face a crisis of survival.\"", "SEATTLE * Leading aerospace analysts are being highly critical of Boeing's push to impose steep tariffs on U.S. sales of Bombardier's small CSeries passenger jet, saying the case will damage the long-term interests of both Boeing and the U.S. aerospace industry.\n\n\"The free market and free competition are good for us,\" said Adam Pilarski, a senior vice president with consulting firm Avitas and a leading aviation analyst. \"Boeing shouldn't want to move away from that, because to do so will hurt Boeing.\"\n\nSo convinced is Pilarski that this prospect harms U.S. interests, he doesn't believe the 220 percent tariff announced Tuesday ultimately will be imposed on the Canadian plane-maker's jets.\n\nPilarski anticipates that in the negotiations with Canada over the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. trade officials will find a way to settle the case before tariffs are imposed.\n\n\"I really don't see it happening,\" Pilarski said.\n\nThe danger for the U.S. is in setting a precedent for rivals to treat American aerospace companies badly, he said.\n\nBy pushing the case before the U.S. International Trade Commission -- a forum that's unilateral and therefore clearly biased -- rather than before an international tribunal, Boeing will only encourage countries like China, Russia and Brazil that have big aerospace ambitions and large home markets to do the same to Boeing in the future, he said.\n\n\"You are giving your real competitors an excuse to say, if the U.S. can do this, we can do it,\" Pilarski said.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, a prominent aviation analyst with the Teal Group, agreed, calling this week's ruling \"a tactical victory but strategically a disaster\" for Boeing.\n\nHe said the immediate harm to Boeing is the likely loss of big defense contracts from the two most reliable military allies of the U.S.\n\nThe Canadian government has already put on hold a $5.2 billion deal that was all but finalized for Boeing's St. Louis-made F/A-18 jet fighters and related weapons systems.\n\nThe Canadians are known to be interested also in buying P-8 anti-submarine jets and Chinook helicopters from Boeing. For now, those possibilities are off the table, too.\n\nAnd because the CSeries wings are made in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where 1,000 jobs are threatened, future U.K. defense buys are also at risk.\n\nAboulafia said the big winner from the Bombardier case may be Boeing's European rival Airbus, which could win airliner orders from Delta Air Lines if the U.S. carrier takes sufficient offense at the U.S. tariff blocking a planned delivery of 75 CSeries jets.\n\nAs for Bombardier, national pride now demands that Canada shore it up.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can market it personally, pointing potential buyers like the Chinese to clear evidence that it's a great airplane: Boeing is afraid of it.\n\n'Moral bankruptcy'\n\nPilarski is close to several top Boeing executives and has a long-running relationship with the company -- having started at the Douglas Aircraft Company, he worked for Boeing briefly after the 1997 merger with St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas.\n\nYet in an interview he was clearly pained at Boeing's tactics.\n\n\"This is letting a bully beat up others, in this case unnecessarily,\" he said. \"Bombardier is a niche player with a small domestic market. They'll produce in a year maybe what Boeing will produce in a month.\"\n\n\"It really hurts me to see this,\" he added. \"I'm an American. I know people at Boeing. It makes me ashamed. It's moral bankruptcy.\"\n\nBoeing's case against Bombardier is based on its receipt of government subsidies.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Bombardier received about $570 million in launch-aid loans from the governments of Canada, Quebec and the U.K., followed by a $1 billion equity investment in 2015 by the government of Quebec, which was granted a 49.5 percent share of the CSeries program.\n\nThe Commerce Department attributed 147 percent of the total 220 percent tariff to that last billion-dollar investment.\n\nYet Pilarski dismisses that money as not an illegal subsidy but as a bailout of the company, which would have gone bankrupt otherwise.\n\nHe compared it to the multiple U.S. bailouts of its auto companies or, in aerospace, the 1979 federal bailout of Lockheed, all of which not only saved the companies involved but also resulted in the government getting its money back later.\n\nPilarski is also incensed that Boeing chose to rest its case on the sale of the CSeries to Delta -- a shaky argument because Delta was looking for a smaller plane than Boeing had and so the company didn't offer a jet in that competition.\n\nBoeing argued that Bombardier offered the CSeries planes to Delta at a lowball price, well below cost.\n\nPilarksi points out that this is the way all commercial-airplane manufacturers operate, including Boeing.\n\nNew airplanes, like the 787 Dreamliner, are sold at well below cost, especially to marquee customers who provide strategic sales momentum.\n\nAboulafia sees irony in the fact that Boeing claims a threat to its smallest new airplane, the 737 MAX 7.\n\nThat plane has indeed sold poorly. It has only two big customers, one of which is WestJet, of Canada, which has not yet taken delivery of the aircraft.\n\n\"Seriously?\" said Aboulafia. \"The prospect for retaliation (by Canada) is all too easy.\"", "REUTERS: Bombardier Inc has finalized a deal to sell up to 50 Q400 planes to SpiceJetvalued at $1.7 billion by list prices, its largest single order to date for the turboprop plane, the Canadian company said on Friday.\n\nThe deal for 25 turboprops and another 25 options gives a needed boost to the company's Q400 program, following recent lacklustre demand, sending shares up 3 percent on Friday.\n\nThe company has had a challenging week. On Tuesday, the U.S. imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties that would effectively block Bombardier jet sales in a key market if upheld.\n\nThe stock fell 14 percent on Wednesday on prospects for growth in its core units, putting it under pressure to find new markets for its jets and a potential new train partner.\n\nFor turboprops, the Canadian plane-and-train maker is trailing its European rival and market leader ATR, which controls about 75 percent of the market and is co-owned by Airbus SE and Leonardo SpA . Brazilian rival Embraer SA also said this month it would consider returning to the prop market.\n\nThe SpiceJet sale was announced as an initial letter of intent in June and is Bombardier's first order for a 90-seat version of the aircraft, up from the current largest model which has been configured with 86 seats.\n\nPlane makers are being asked to pack more seats into aircraft to lower costs per seat and a 90-seat Q400 would be especially attractive for regions such as the Asia-Pacific, a turboprop industry source who does not work for Bombardier said.\n\n\"This is a big deal for them,\" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media. \"I don't think a 90-seater is for every market, but there's certainly a market for it.\"\n\nPassengers in North America typically want more space when they travel and the Q400 is configured with up to 78 seats for that market.\n\nSeparately on Friday, the World Trade Organization opened an expected dispute settlement panel to rule on Brazil's complaint that Canada hurt its commercial jet industry by subsidizing the CSeries, the Brazilian foreign ministry said.\n\nCanada has previously contested Brazil's complaint in the WTO trade case which could drag on for years.", "Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused.

In fact, you are thousands of times more likely to die while driving to the airport than you are flying in a plane.\n\nYet for all the safety advances, aviation safety experts have long been stymied by plane crashes in the sea. The onboard recorders, known as black boxes, can be difficult, if not impossible, to recover deep beneath the waves.\n\nBut a new generation of recorders, announced this summer by Airbus and set to roll out on new A350 airframes in late 2019, will make those boxes easier to retrieve. Instead of going down to the bottom with the plane, a recorder will be released and float back to the surface. It will then send a signal that satellites could pick up, allowing searchers to pinpoint its location.\n\nThat could be just the first step in changing how data is recovered in a plane crash. Some industry advocates suggest that airplanes no longer carry their flight data at all and instead live-stream it to a central storage place on the ground. But \"that future is taking some time to materialize all across the fleet,\" said Charles Champion, executive vice president of engineering at Airbus Commercial Aircraft. \"The drawback to that is we don't have broadband everywhere,\" so streaming is not yet reliable enough to make onboard black boxes obsolete.\n\nNo matter how they obtain the information, investigators say it is important to learn the causes of air crashes. \"If you don't solve the accident or if it remains unclear, it can cast a pall,\" said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. \"The way you do that these days is by looking at the data.\"\n\nThe redesigned recorders are largely a response to two of aviation's biggest modern-day disasters. Both highlighted the limitations of the current generation of black boxes.\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro, killing all 228 people on board. After a multinational, multimillion-dollar search that lasted more than two years, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were finally recovered from the ocean floor.\n\nThey revealed that the crash had been caused in part by faulty pitot (pronounced PEE-toe) tubes -- sensors that provide airspeed data to the pilots. The tubes had gotten clogged with ice, resulting in some inaccurate data in the cockpit. Confused by mixed signals from their instruments, the pilots unintentionally put their aircraft into an aerodynamic stall, which ultimately caused the crash.\n\nIn the wake of that time-consuming and expensive recovery effort, many in the aviation industry and regulators began calling for flight data to be made more easily recoverable after a crash. That effort gained traction in 2014 after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared. Based on radar data, experts believe it probably veered off course and crashed into the Indian Ocean while flying between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing.\n\nMost of the wreckage, including the data and voice recorders, was never recovered, so the precise cause of the route deviation has not officially been determined. There were 239 people on board.\n\nWhen a plane crashes into water, a sonic beacon on the recorders sends out a signal for about 30 days. In theory, the beacon makes them discoverable with the right sonar equipment, but that is not necessarily the case in deep water, especially if investigators do not already know the precise location of the wreckage.\n\nAirbus's new generation of recorders, which is still being developed by L3 Technologies and the Canadian subsidiary of Leonardo DRS, will combine voice and data functions into one apparatus. Aircraft will carry both a fixed and deployable version, each storing 25 hours of cockpit voice -- up from about two hours now -- and data on thousands of flight parameters.\n\nIn the event of a crash, the deployable recorder will be released from the plane, \"triggered either by structural deformation in the fuselage or because it starts to go under water,\" Mr. Champion, of Airbus, said. \"Under a few meters, it will release, and the box pops up back to the surface.\"\n\nOnce the box is separated from the fuselage, a satellite-based detection system will be activated -- the first of its kind on a civilian aircraft. \"The first alert will go off within three seconds after the beacon is deployed,\" said Blake van den Heuvel, director of air programs at DRS Technologies Canada. \"With that first hit, they'll be able to pinpoint the location of the downed aircraft.\"\n\nUnlike traditional sonic locaters, the satellite-based technology instantly provides the recorder's exact position, updating regularly as it bobs on the water. DRS is designing that satellite locator to last 150 hours -- about six days. The traditional beacon on the fixed recorder, in the aircraft, will be upgraded to transmit for 90 days in response to regulations that go into effect in 2018.\n\nMr. van den Heuvel said that his company had been supplying similar deployable recorders on military aircraft for decades and that they had a proven record of recoverability.\n\n\"For the ones that don't get recovered, I think you'll find that we have situations where we've had a midair collision of two tactical aircraft, two very, very small aircraft both approaching Mach 1, and in that event you have very little left of the aircraft,\" he said. \"For transport aircraft, we've had a 100 percent success rate.\"\n\nAlthough Boeing has not made any similar announcements about efforts to make data on its aircraft easier to recover, the company emphasized that it placed a high value on safety.\n\n\"The culture of safety has really progressed collectively over the years,\" said Elizabeth A. Pasztor, Boeing's vice president for safety, security and compliance.\n\nThe industry is much more likely than it once was to share data, Ms. Pasztor said. \"When it comes to safety, we truly do collaborate as an industry,\" she said. \"This is not an area to compete.\"\n\nIn the past, with less technology and fewer regulations, flying was a much riskier way to travel. Archival pages from The New York Times can attest that not so long ago, pilots were more likely to misjudge terrain and crash into mountains, or even to crash into other planes in midair.\n\nThe last fatal airliner crash in the United States occurred in 2013 when an Asiana Airlines flight came in too low as it approached the runway in San Francisco and struck the sea wall at its edge. Video shows the plane pirouetting dramatically across the runway, but despite the remarkable images, only three people died; one of them survived the crash only to be run over by a rescue vehicle racing to the scene. The passengers who were killed were not wearing their seatbelts and were ejected from the plane.\n\nIn 2009, 50 people died when a Colgan Air commuter flight from Newark to Buffalo stalled approaching the runway, essentially falling out of the sky. That accident led to a series of new regulations based on recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board on flight crew training and working conditions.\n\nRobert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the N.T.S.B., emphasized that making flying safer was a shared effort across the industry. It has largely been successful, he said, but is continuing.\n\n\"When you put all of this together -- the human, the machine, the environment, including the things the aircraft manufacturers are doing -- those things combine to make our aviation system much more safe than it was a few decades ago,\" Mr. Sumwalt said.", "First look: Nashville airport unveils expansion designs Fullscreen A rendering of a renovated and expanded Nashville International Airport.

It includes a central entrance with natural light and a spacious look that plays off the themes and shape of an acoustic guitar.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: It's official: British Airways' Dreamliners will fly from Nashville\n\nThe flow and design, which architects say was also inspired by the city's parks and green spaces, make for a similar feel to Nashville's Music City Center.\n\nPlans also call for a new on-site, 288-room hotel; a six-story parking garage with 2,000 spaces, tripling the amount of short-term parking; an expansion of the airport's concourse D with new retail; a new office building; a new facility for international travelers; and a relocated Donelson Pike further away from the airport.\n\nPHOTOS: Nashville airport unveils expansion designs (story continues below)\n\nThere will also be accommodations for a potential drop-off spot for a light rail line as part of Mayor Megan Barry's proposed transit plan.\n\n\"As opposed to concepts that we originally launched, we can now show the public, the community, the real look and feel of BNA,\" said Tom Jurkovich, vice president of strategic communications for the airport. \"So, 'BNA Vision' comes alive for us now.\"\n\nAirport officials are to join with Barry to formally unveil the designs on Friday. They've also created a virtual reality and 3D modeling view that gives people a chance to tour the upgrades by maneuvering their phone.\n\nThe Dallas-based architecture firm Corgan worked over the past year to complete the final deigns.\n\nBillion-dollar project comes amid Nashville airport's rapid growth\n\nThe massive overhaul is in response to the airport's breakneck growth. Buoyed by Nashville's population boom and rise in tourism, annual passengers increased in 2016 by 11.2% to 13.5 passengers, making it the fastest-growing airport of its size the nation.\n\n\"Our city is booming and the new BNA design will reflect the best of Music City, taking our travel opportunities to new heights,\" country music star Dierks Bentley, Nashville Airport Authority board member, says in a video unveiling the airport's designs.\n\nRoss Payton, a principal of Corgan, said the expanded Concourse D -- which is currently is only rarely used -- will allow for additional aircraft gates.\n\nPlans call for a doubling of security lanes -- an increase by 14 lanes to limit long lines -- and additional ticketing counters at the North and South ends of the terminal building.\n\n\"Nashville has a warm and welcoming charm, and we wanted to maintain that feel throughout the terminal, so we drew upon local inspiration to inform and guide the new design,\" Payton said, adding that the designs seeks to \"blur the line between indoor and outdoor.\"\n\nFIRST LOOK: We're planning a bigger terminal for Nashville International Airport with a beautiful plaza. #BNAVisionpic.twitter.com/LIChzohwBx -- Fly Nashville (@Fly_Nashville)\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos (story continues below)\n\nMay's #avgeek photo gallery Fullscreen With its distinctive paint scheme, Iron Maiden's Boeing 747-400 rests at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on April 11, 2016.

The airport authority earlier this year issued a request for proposals from potential hotel companies to run the hotel. A final decision is expected in December.\n\nRobert Ramsey, chief engineer and vice president of development and engineering, said the airport authority would retain ownership of the hotel after a hotel company is contracted.\n\nThe new international arrivals center comes after Nashville recently landed a nonstop flight to London via a new British Airways connection beginning in May. To accommodate British Airways prior to the new facility's opening, the airport is also overseeing interim upgrades to the existing international travelers area.\n\n\"We think the London flight will open up a global market,\" Ramsey said.\n\nDavid Lind, chairman of Corgan's board, called the idea of \"connection\" the most compelling design theme that came out of the \"BNA Vision\" designs process.\n\n\"And by this, we mean the airport is the critical transportation to the region, connecting the community, connecting the city and connecting it to the world around us,\" he said.\n\nPhase one of the five-phase project began earlier this year with construction of a parking and transportation center.\n\nThe airport authority's board of commissioners is paying for the project almost entirely from bonds that it will issue. Airport officials are stressing that no tax dollars will be used.\n\nSo far, around $90 million toward the overhaul has already been awarded through contracts with another $80 million on tap for over the next six months. The project is expected to be finished in 2023.\n\nJoey Garrison is a reporter at The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper, part of the USA TODAY Network.

On Tuesday, the U.S. imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties that would effectively block Bombardier jet sales in a key market if upheld.\n\nThe stock fell 14 percent on Wednesday on prospects for growth in its core units, putting it under pressure to find new markets for its jets and a potential new train partner.\n\nFor turboprops, the Canadian plane-and-train maker is trailing its European rival and market leader ATR, which controls about 75 percent of the market and is co-owned by Airbus SE and Leonardo SpA . Brazilian rival Embraer SA also said this month it would consider returning to the prop market.\n\nThe SpiceJet sale was announced as an initial letter of intent in June, and is Bombardier's first order for a 90-seat version of the aircraft, up from the current largest model which has been configured with 86 seats.\n\nPlane makers are being asked to pack more seats into aircraft to lower costs per seat and a 90-seat Q400 would be especially attractive for regions such as the Asia-Pacific, a turboprop industry source who does not work for Bombardier said.\n\n\"This is a big deal for them,\" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media. \"I don't think a 90-seater is for every market, but there's certainly a market for it.\"\n\nPassengers in North America typically want more space when they travel and the Q400 is configured with up to 78 seats for that market.\n\nSeparately on Friday, the World Trade Organization opened an expected dispute settlement panel to rule on Brazil's complaint that Canada hurt its commercial jet industry by subsidizing the CSeries, the Brazilian foreign ministry said.\n\nCanada has previously contested Brazil's complaint in the WTO trade case which could drag on for years.\n\n(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Susan Thomas)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "By Tom Miles\n\nGENEVA, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The United States surprised a meeting of the World Trade Organization on Friday with an interpretation of dispute settlement rules some said was a bid to boost President Donald Trump's plans to reform the global body.

[nL1N1K206B]\n\nThe ministry has said it is also seeking information from European aerospace giant Airbus, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon along with Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo.\n\nThe development is a boost for Boeing at a time when it is under fire from Canada and Britain after its complaint prompted the United States to impose a preliminary 220-percent duty on CSeries jets built by Bombardier. [nL2N1M80SO]\n\nBoeing said it was working with the U.S. government to provide the information that Germany had requested.\n\nGermany, due to decide in mid-2018 about how to replace the Tornado planes, announced plans in July to build a European fighter jet together with France. But the new jet is unlikely to be available by 2025, when Germany's fleet of Tornado fighters are slated to start going out of service.\n\nSources familiar with the process said Germany was pursuing a two-pronged approach under which it would buy an existing fighter to replace the Tornado, while working with France on a new European jet to replace its Eurofighters at a later point.\n\nAnalysts said the Tornado replacement order could be worth tens of billions of dollars, although Germany is still reviewing how many jets to buy and at what pace.\n\nThe letter said a formal request for information about the pricing and availability of all three U.S. fighter jets was being compiled and would be issued by the end of the month.\n\nBOEING UNDER FIRE\n\nBritain told Boeing this week that future defence contracts could be in jeopardy because of its trade dispute with Canada's Bombardier, noting that U.S. tariffs would put up to 4,200 jobs at risk at a plant in the British province of Northern Ireland that makes the CSeries jet's carbon wings.

The first Boeing is due around May 2018.", "By Julie Johnsson, Ryan Beene and Frederic Tomesco * Bloomberg\n\nBoeing is making the best of its unlikely rapport with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe planemaker's latest victory came this week when the Trump administration slapped far larger duties on a competing Bombardier jet than Boeing had requested in a trade spat with its Canadian rival. There's also been good news for the company's defense division as the Pentagon acquired the next Air Force One fleet last month and named Boeing a finalist for a $62 billion missile-defense system.\n\nIt might have been hard to imagine that Boeing would enjoy such good fortune back on Dec. 6, when President-elect Trump scolded the company in a Twitter broadside for \"out of control\" costs on the presidential plane. But the attack provided a path for Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg to establish a rare, direct channel with the commander-in-chief that continues to benefit the largest U.S. exporter as it navigates a fiercely competitive market.\n\n\"It ended up opening up some communication lines,\" Muilenburg recalled at a forum in Washington on Wednesday. \"We took that seriously.\"\n\nIt's an example of how Boeing, under Muilenburg's leadership, hasn't hesitated to embrace unconventional tactics in its dealings with competitors, suppliers, customers -- and even a U.S. president. While there's always the chance that the strategy could backfire, the approach has largely been successful. Through Thursday, the Chicago-based company has been the best performer on the Dow Jones industrial average this year.\n\nBoeing has stood out from other U.S. companies in the way it has dealt with Trump. After the uproar over the president's comments about protesters in Charlottesville, Va., CEOs from Merck, Under Armour and other companies spoke out or resigned from Trump's corporate advisory panels. Both Boeing and Muilenburg made no comment.\n\nThe trade spat has thwarted the U.S. expansion of Bombardier's C Series, a technologically advanced aircraft that over the longer term poses a threat to the 737 jetliner, Boeing's largest source of profit. While the case winds through a review process, no U.S. carrier is likely to risk duties similar to the estimated penalty of about $3.4 billion assessed for the 75 Bombardier jets ordered last year by Delta Air Lines, said aerospace analyst Seth Seifman of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBoeing is looking decades ahead \"and thinking about more competition, not only from Canada but also from China and Russia, where programs also benefit from state support,\" Seifman said in a note to clients. \"In the meantime, Boeing is likely to vigorously pursue this case against Bombardier to show that it's serious about countering aircraft industry government support.\"\n\nOther countries have protested Boeing's strong stance. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May lashed out at the planemaker after the U.S. import duties were announced this week. Her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, has threatened to scrap a multibillion deal to buy St. Louis-made F/A-18 Super Hornets.\n\nBoeing had long been a target of fiscally conservative Republicans before Trump's surprise victory last year. Much of the criticism centers on the company's reliance on the U.S. Export-Import bank to help finance multibillion-dollar jet orders and for the support State Department officials sometimes provide to sway transactions. Conservatives have long criticized the agency as an example of what they call \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nBut Boeing has made the most of the objectives it shares with Trump, a cheerleader for U.S. manufacturing. Muilenburg found the private Trump happy to chat.\n\n\"He's a very eager listener,\" the CEO said. \"He likes to engage and have dialogue and look at problems from different directions. He's willing to listen and open to seeing different views, and I found that to be constructive.\"\n\nThe conversation piqued the president's interest in a proposed upgrade of the Super Hornet, the capabilities of which the Pentagon is studying in comparison with those of Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter. And the Air Force bought two so-called \"white tail\" 747 jumbos -- aircraft built without a buyer -- in lieu of more expensive custom-built planes in August.\n\nNot everything has gone Boeing's way. The Export-Import Bank still isn't open for business, while about $20 billion in airplane sales to Iran remain in limbo as Trump questions a nuclear pact negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\nMuilenburg didn't publicly address Trump's role in the trade dispute or why Boeing waited until this year to challenge Bombardier's April 2016 deal with Delta. But Boeing would have \"filed a dumping complaint against Bombardier regardless of who is president,\" said Tim Neale, a spokesman for the U.S. company.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative has challenged the European Union's subsidies to Airbus SE in a trade case that has been winding through the World Trade Organization for more than a decade with support from presidents of both parties, Neale said by email.\n\n\"There's a basic principal at stake here, which is the obligation that trading nations have to play by the rules embodied in domestic and international trade law,\" Neale said.\n\nThat Boeing brought the case in the first place surprised some in the industry. Delta is an important and powerful customer and Boeing no longer makes a plane in the 100-seat category being contested.\n\nWhile Boeing savors its victory, the longer-term benefit remains unclear, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said.

(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham and Susan Thomas)", "JOHANNESBURG - China's domestically developed C919 passenger jet completed its second test flight yesterday, the jet's maker said, but the duration and near five-month gap since its first flight have raised questions over whether its latest delivery target can be met.\n\nThe narrow-body C919, which will compete with Boeing's 737 and the Airbus SE A320, is a symbol of China's ambition to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2trillion (R27trln) over the next 20 years.\n\nHowever, the programme has faced lengthy delays and missed its original target of delivery to customers by 2016 - a date reportedly pushed back to 2020. Sales to date have been restricted largely to its home market because it has yet to be certified by regulators in the US and Europe.\n\nYesterday's flight was the second for the initial C919 test model, whose maiden flight was on May 5. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) said the plane reached an altitude of 10000 feet during a flight that took off from Shanghai's Pudong Airport.\n\n\"Various elements of the test flight, including with the raising/lowering of the landing gear, were all completed smoothly,\" Comac said. The 166-minute flight time was more than double the maiden flight of 80 minutes, but 54 minutes shorter than plans detailed in an article published by state-backed news website ThePaper.cn earlier.\n\nComac did not immediately reply to questions on whether the flight was shorter than planned.\n\n- REUTERS", "Who could have imagined that Boeing would enjoy such good fortune back in December, when President-elect Trump scolded the company in a Twitter broadside for \"out of control\" costs on the presidential plane? But that attack provided a path for Boeing to establish a direct channel that continues to benefit the largest U.S. exporter.\n\nBoeing Co. is making the best of its unlikely rapport with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe planemaker's latest victory came this week when the Trump administration slapped far larger duties on a competing Bombardier Inc. jet than Boeing had requested in a trade spat with its Canadian rival. There's also been good news for the company's defense division as the Pentagon acquired the next Air Force One fleet last month and named Boeing a finalist for a $62 billion missile-defense system.\n\nIt might have been hard to imagine that Boeing would enjoy such good fortune back on Dec. 6, when President-elect Trump scolded the company in a Twitter broadside for \"out of control\" costs on the presidential plane. But the attack provided a path for CEO Dennis Muilenburg to establish a rare, direct channel with the commander-in-chief that continues to benefit the largest U.S. exporter as it navigates a fiercely competitive market.\n\n\"It ended up opening up some communication lines,\" Muilenburg recalled at a forum in Washington on Wednesday. \"We took that seriously.\"\n\nIt's an example of how Boeing, under Muilenburg's leadership, hasn't hesitated to embrace unconventional tactics in its dealings with competitors, suppliers, customers -- and even a U.S. president. While there's always the chance that the strategy could backfire, the approach has largely been successful. The Chicago-based company has been the best performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, with shares up 63%. (They traded at $253.26 at 9:31 a.m. in New York on Friday.)\n\nBoeing has stood out from other U.S. companies in the way it has dealt with Trump. After the uproar over the president's comments about protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, CEOs from Merck & Co., Under Armour Inc. and other companies spoke out or resigned from Trump's corporate advisory panels. Both Boeing and Muilenburg made no comment.\n\nThe trade spat has thwarted the U.S. expansion of Bombardier's C Series, a technologically advanced aircraft that over the longer term poses a threat to the 737 jetliner, Boeing's largest source of profit. While the case winds through a review process, no U.S. carrier is likely to risk duties similar to the estimated penalty of about $3.4 billion assessed for the 75 Bombardier jets ordered last year by Delta Air Lines Inc., said aerospace analyst Seth Seifman of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\n'Decades Ahead'\n\nBoeing is looking decades ahead \"and thinking about more competition, not only from Canada but also from China and Russia, where programs also benefit from state support,\" Seifman said in a note to clients. \"In the meantime, Boeing is likely to vigorously pursue this case against Bombardier to show that it's serious about countering aircraft industry government support.\"\n\nOther countries have protested Boeing's strong stance. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May lashed out at the planemaker after the U.S. import duties were announced this week. Her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, has threatened to scrap a multibillion fighter-jet deal.\n\nBoeing had long been a target of fiscally conservative Republicans before Trump's surprise victory last year. Much of the criticism centers on the company's reliance on the U.S. Export-Import bank to help finance multibillion-dollar jet orders and for the support State Department officials sometimes provide to sway transactions. Conservatives have long criticized the agency as an example of what they call \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nShared Objectives\n\nBut Boeing has made the most of the objectives it shares with Trump, a cheerleader for U.S. manufacturing. Muilenburg found the private Trump happy to chat.\n\n\"He's a very eager listener,\" the CEO said. \"He likes to engage and have dialogue and look at problems from different directions. He's willing to listen and open to seeing different views, and I found that to be constructive.\"\n\nThe conversation piqued the president's interest in a proposed upgrade of Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, the capabilities of which the Pentagon is studying in comparison with those of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 stealth fighter. And the Air Force bought two so-called \"white tail\" 747 jumbos -- aircraft built without a buyer -- in lieu of more expensive custom-built planes in August.\n\nNot everything has gone Boeing's way. The Export-Import Bank still isn't open for business, while about $20 billion in airplane sales to Iran remain in limbo as Trump questions a nuclear pact negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\nMuilenburg didn't publicly address Trump's role in the trade dispute or why Boeing waited until this year to challenge Bombardier's April 2016 deal with Delta. But Boeing would have \"filed a dumping complaint against Bombardier regardless of who is president,\" said Tim Neale, a spokesman for the U.S. company.\n\nAirbus Subsidies\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative has challenged the European Union's subsidies to Airbus SE in a trade case that has been winding through the World Trade Organization for more than a decade with support from presidents of both parties, Neale said by email.\n\n\"There's a basic principal at stake here, which is the obligation that trading nations have to play by the rules embodied in domestic and international trade law,\" Neale said.\n\nThat Boeing brought the case in the first place surprised some in the industry. Delta is an important and powerful customer and Boeing no longer makes a plane in the 100-seat category being contested.\n\nWhile Boeing savors its victory, the longer-term benefit remains unclear, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said. The duties ultimately could be reduced as Bombardier, Canada, the U.K. and other parties press their appeals. And U.S. airlines mulling the C Series aren't likely to look lightly on Boeing's interference.\n\n\"That's another example of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said. \"The consequence will be to drive them straight into the arms of Airbus, because none of these guys like having their hands tied in negotiation.\"\n\nBy Julie Johnsson, Ryan Beene and Frederic Tomesco", "There are quite a few companies working on developing drones for human transportation, but a new one has just jumped into the fray. With an almost fully developed prototype and plans to start producing them commercially next year, the aptly named Passenger Drone introduced itself by showing off a manned flight on its first prototype.\n\nThe company has been quietly working on its tech for the last three years and it has produced a lightweight, car-sized drone that can fly autonomously, be maneuvered remotely or be controlled manually. It's lifted by 16 rotors and produces zero emissions. Passenger Drone says it plans to build five more prototypes and log over 1000 hours of flight time before proceeding with commercial production.\n\nWhile Passenger Drone's rig may be inching close to real life flights, it's entering a crowded field. Companies like EHang, Airbus and Volocopter are just a few of the groups working on their own models and Volocopter's drone took its maiden test flight earlier this month.\n\nYou can check out Passenger Drone's first manned flight in the video below.", "XAutoplay: On | OffLate Thursday, Musk announced plans to build a new megarocket that could travel to Mars, the moon and in Earth orbit. But the so-called BFR, short for \"Big F***ing Rocket,\" would also be able to take travelers anywhere on the planet in \"under an hour\" for the same cost as a plane ticket, he said.\n\nMaking his presentation Friday at the International Aeronautical Congress in Australia, Musk said the BFR would take passengers into low Earth orbit before offloading them on landing pads, similar to the floating drones the company uses to land its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. That could cut travel time from London to Dubai from 7 hours to just 29 minutes.\n\nThe BFR would be 122 meters tall, about double the height of the Falcon 9, and could have up to six times the number of engines as the Falcon 9. While still in the theoretical stage, Musk said he wants to start building the BFR in the next six to nine months.\n\nBoeing shares were down 0.1% at 254.07 on the stock market today but still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 246.59 buy point two weeks ago.

[nL1N1K206B]\n\nThe ministry has said it is also seeking information from European aerospace giant Airbus, which builds the Eurofighter Typhoon along with Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo.\n\nThe development is a boost for Boeing at a time when it is under fire from Canada and Britain after its complaint prompted the United States to impose a preliminary 220-percent duty on CSeries jets built by Bombardier. [nL2N1M80SO]\n\nBoeing said it was working with the U.S. government to provide the information that Germany had requested.\n\nGermany, due to decide in mid-2018 about how to replace the Tornado planes, announced plans in July to build a European fighter jet together with France.

The carrier has meanwhile struck a branding deal with South Africa's Fedair, which is owned by Solenta, that will boost its presence in the continent's largest economy and pave the way for the start of its own flights there some time in 2018, according to Bezuidenhout.\n\nFastjet traded up 1.2 percent in London, extending gains this year to 31 percent. The stock has lost ground or barely advanced every trading year since the carrier was founded in 2012.\n\nUnder the new CEO, hired last year from the low-cost Mango arm of South African Airways, Fastjet has offloaded a fleet of six Airbus SE A319s with 145 to 156 seats and switched to smaller regional jets better matched to demand. The last A319, based in Tanzania, will leave in December, to be replaced by two 108-seat Embraer E190s, with the two other ERJ145s based in Zimbabwe.\n\nFastjet has also agreed to lease three Avions de Transport Regional ATR 72 turboprops, one of which may be used to commence its own South African services. The 70-seat aircraft would also be well suited to serving Mozambique or for flights between secondary cities in Tanzania, Bezuidenhout said.\n\nThe carrier already connects Johannesburg with Zimbabwe, offering four flights a day from the capital, Harare. That's lured more business passengers and helped lift unit revenue across the group by 33 percent in the first half.\n\nFastjet, which has yet to post an annual profit, has been trading in the black in Tanzania for three or four months and showed a profit in Zimbabwe in August, putting it on course to end losses overall next quarter, the CEO said.\n\nFastjet will consider a stock listing in addition to London's Alternative Investment Market next year, with Johannesburg's AltX exchange favored, Bezuidenhout said. Nigeria is also an option, though exposure there would be best tied to the launch of flights in West Africa, something not planned before 2020.

(COMAC) executive told reporters on Friday.\n\nThe narrow-body C919, which will compete with Boeing Co's 737 and the Airbus SE A320, completed its second test flight on Thursday, almost five months after its maiden flight earlier this year in May.\n\nShi Jianzhong, COMAC Vice President, said a number of \"issues\" relating to the plane's technology and its engine had led to the lengthy gap between the C919's first and second flight.\n\n\"We were being cautious,\" he said, speaking at an event to announce the naming of a separate wide-body jet being developed by COMAC and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), which will be called the CR929.\n\n\"We expect future test flights to be very close together,\" he said, adding that the next flight could be \"a few days or one to two weeks\" away.\n\nThe almost five month-gap between the C919's first and second flight was far longer than that of other planes, such as the Airbus A350 whose gap was five days.\n\nOn the CR929, UAC said in a statement that the team had already decided on the plane's family concept and its preliminary characteristics. Shi said that the plane was in the second, design-focused, stage of its development.\n\nThe two companies' joint venture, which was set up in May, will be called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation (CRAIC), they said.", "Flybe Aviation Services is an approved maintenance centre for Bombardier aircraft\n\nA trade row threatening jobs at aeroplane manufacturers Bombardier will not affect maintenance contracts on the aircraft.\n\nFlybe Aviation Services, based at Exeter Airport, is among the world's leading and most advanced maintenance, repairs and overhaul organisations for regional airlines.\n\nIt looks after Bombardier aircraft including the Bombardier Dash-8 100/200 and Q400, Bombardier CRJ 100/200 and 700/900 and Bombardier Challenger 850 along with Embraer and Airbus.\n\nA Flybe spokesman has confirmed: \"The current Bombardier issue will have no impact on Flybe Aviation Services in Exeter.\"\n\nBombardier is currently at the centre of a trade row after the US ruled to impose an import tax on the C-Series jet made by Canada-firm Bombardier.\n\nThe proposed 220% import tariff could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast.\n\nThe UK government and trade unions fear the imposition of tariffs could make the Canadian firm question whether to remain in Northern Ireland, where it employs 4,100 of its 28,000-strong workforce.\n\nAbout 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built \u00a3520m factory at Queen's Island in Belfast.\n\nHugo Swire, Conservative MP for East Devon and former Foreign Office minister said that the trade spat 'does not bode well for any U.K.-U.S. trade deal' post-Brexit.", "Boeing Co. is making the best of its unlikely rapport with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe planemaker's latest victory came this week when the Trump administration slapped far larger duties on a competing Bombardier Inc. (TSX:BBD.B) jet than Boeing had requested in a trade spat with its Canadian rival. There's also been good news for the company's defence division as the Pentagon acquired the next Air Force One fleet last month and named Boeing (NYSE: BA) a finalist for a $62-billion missile-defence system.\n\nIt might have been hard to imagine that Boeing would enjoy such good fortune back on Dec. 6, when president-elect Trump scolded the company in a Twitter broadside for \"out of control\" costs on the presidential plane. But the attack provided a path for chief executive officer Dennis Muilenburg to establish a rare, direct channel with the commander-in-chief that continues to benefit the largest U.S. exporter as it navigates a fiercely competitive market.\n\n\"It ended up opening up some communication lines,\" Muilenburg recalled at a forum in Washington on Wednesday. \"We took that seriously.\"\n\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016\n\nIt's an example of how Boeing, under Muilenburg's leadership, hasn't hesitated to embrace unconventional tactics in its dealings with competitors, suppliers, customers -- and even a U.S. president. While there's always the chance that the strategy could backfire, the approach has largely been successful. Through Thursday, the Chicago-based company has been the best performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.\n\nBoeing has stood out from other U.S. companies in the way it has dealt with Trump. After the uproar over the president's comments about protesters in Charlottesville, Va., CEOs from Merck & Co., Under Armour Inc. and other companies spoke out or resigned from Trump's corporate advisory panels. Both Boeing and Muilenburg made no comment.\n\nThe trade spat has thwarted the U.S. expansion of Bombardier's CSeries, a technologically advanced aircraft that over the longer term poses a threat to the 737 jetliner, Boeing's largest source of profit. While the case winds through a review process, no U.S. carrier is likely to risk duties similar to the estimated penalty of about $3.4 billion assessed for the 75 Bombardier jets ordered last year by Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL), said aerospace analyst Seth Seifman of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\n'Serious about countering government support'\n\nBoeing is looking decades ahead \"and thinking about more competition, not only from Canada but also from China and Russia, where programs also benefit from state support,\" Seifman said in a note to clients. \"In the meantime, Boeing is likely to vigorously pursue this case against Bombardier to show that it's serious about countering aircraft industry government support.\"\n\nOther countries have protested against Boeing's strong stance. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May lashed out at the planemaker after the U.S. import duties were announced this week. Her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, has threatened to scrap a multibillion fighter-jet deal.\n\nBoeing had long been a target of fiscally conservative Republicans before Trump's surprise victory last year. Much of the criticism centres on the company's reliance on the U.S. Export-Import bank to help finance multibillion-dollar jet orders and for the support State Department officials sometimes provide to sway transactions. Conservatives have long criticized the agency as an example of what they call \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nBut Boeing has made the most of the objectives it shares with Trump, a cheerleader for U.S. manufacturing. Muilenburg found the private Trump happy to chat.\n\n\"He's a very eager listener,\" the CEO said. \"He likes to engage and have dialogue and look at problems from different directions. He's willing to listen and open to seeing different views, and I found that to be constructive.\"\n\nThe conversation piqued the president's interest in a proposed upgrade of Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, the capabilities of which the Pentagon is studying in comparison with those of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 stealth fighter. And the Air Force bought two so-called \"white tail\" 747 jumbos -- aircraft built without a buyer -- in lieu of more expensive custom-built planes in August.\n\nNot everything has gone Boeing's way. The Export-Import Bank still isn't open for business, while about $20 billion in airplane sales to Iran remain in limbo as Trump questions a nuclear pact negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\nMuilenburg didn't publicly address Trump's role in the trade dispute or why Boeing waited until this year to challenge Bombardier's April 2016 deal with Delta. But Boeing would have \"filed a dumping complaint against Bombardier regardless of who is president,\" said Tim Neale, a spokesman for the U.S. company.\n\n'Play by the rules'\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative has challenged the European Union's subsidies to Airbus SE in a trade case that has been winding through the World Trade Organization for more than a decade with support from presidents of both parties, Neale said by email.\n\n\"There's a basic principal at stake here, which is the obligation that trading nations have to play by the rules embodied in domestic and international trade law,\" Neale said.\n\nThat Boeing brought the case in the first place surprised some in the industry. Delta is an important and powerful customer and Boeing no longer makes a plane in the 100-seat category being contested.\n\nWhile Boeing savors its victory, the longer-term benefit remains unclear, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said. The duties ultimately could be reduced as Bombardier, Canada, the U.K. and other parties press their appeals. And U.S. airlines mulling the CSeries aren't likely to look lightly on Boeing's interference.\n\n\"That's another example of tactics over strategy,\" Aboulafia said. \"The consequence will be to drive them straight into the arms of Airbus (EPA: AIR), because none of these guys like having their hands tied in negotiation.\"\n\nby Julie Johnsson, Ryan Beene Frederic Tomesco", "The fleet and hubs of American Airlines Fullscreen The tail of an American Airlines Boeing 777 peeks out of a hangar at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Oct. 14, 2016.

The service, using apps including Apple's iMessage, will be available \"soon'' but no timetable was provided. The service will be available on flights that have Wi-Fi, but Wi-Fi charges will not apply. American currently charges $5 for in-flight texting, where available. Southwest Airlines charges $2. (Related: The latest free perk on U.S. airlines: Mobile messaging)\n\n- Free drinks and dedicated overhead bin space for travelers buying Main Cabin Extra tickets beginning in the first half of 2018. Those seats near the front of economy class have extra legroom and include priority boarding for a fee that starts at $20 per flight. (It was $37 one way for a Phoenix-Dallas flight this week.) The airline said it does not plan to boost the price of Main Cabin Extra seats when the extra perks are added.\n\n- Boost the availability of frequent-flier seats at the lowest award levels.

Celtic won 3-0 at Anderlecht in the group's other match yesterday.\n\nBayern enjoyed a good spell in the first half and caused problems for the hosts' defense. But it lacked pace and finishing after conceding early.\n\nAncelotti unexpectedly left wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery on the bench, opting for a more defensive approach with Arturo Vidal and Corentin Tolisso instead. Ancelotti also gave starting roles to Niklas Sule and Javi Martinez in the heart of his defense, at the expense of Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, with the latter being left out of the squad.\n\nThere was no surprise in Unai Emery's 4-3-3 line-up and PSG needed just two minutes to break through following inspiration from Neymar. The Brazil forward received the ball on the left and quickly moved it forward to get past a defender. Neymar cut inside through a sea of legs and delivered a perfect assist on the right of the box for the unmarked Alves, who fired home from a tight angle.\n\nBayern did not panic and tried to regain its composure with a spell of possession. It worked, and Javi Martinez came close with a shot from the edge of the box that forced 'keeper Alphonse Areola to palm the ball over with a diving save.\n\nBayern threatened from set pieces but still struggled to contain the attacking verve and tremendous pace of Neymar and Mbappe, with its midfield and back four often left wide open.\n\nPSG did not take advantage of its chances, though, until Cavani made it 2-0 near the half-hour mark, curling a superb shot into the top corner from Mbappe's assist to beat 'keeper Sven Ulreich.\n\nAncelotti brought on former PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman and Sebastian Rudy after the interval to turn things around. The pair added an extra threat but the visitors continued to be vulnerable to counterattacks as Mbappe and Neymar combined on the edge of the box, only for the Brazil star to send a shot wide.\n\nNeymar made amends a few minutes later after Alves led another charge and found Mbappe down the right.

Hasan Salihamid\u017eic (Bayern sporting director) and I spoke to Carlo today and informed him of our decision.\n\n\"I would like to thank Carlo for the co-operation and I regret this development.

Only Barcelona and Real Madrid have ever inflicted heavier defeats on Bayern in the Champions League.

We dominated the full game, so we can be very happy.\n\n\"We'll see. It's still too early to look too far ahead. We just go game by game.\n\n\"But, of course, this was a very important game for us.

We will respect every team, but we don't need to be afraid.\n\n\"We just need to keep going with our game, how we are playing and as we showed against Anderlecht, if we play like that, results will come.\n\n\"It was important for us to respond strongly after the PSG game, especially for ourselves.\n\n\"It was important to prove, after a bad game, we can still deliver a good result. Now we have to look forward.\n\n\"When you lose five goals you have to learn something. If you don't then in the next game you will also lose.\n\n\"But we showed we have learned a lot of things. We have to be proud of this win.\n\n\"It's very important that Dedryck is back because he is a central defender. Until the last game I played with midfielders and full-backs.\n\n\"So it means a lot, not for me, but for the whole team, to have Dedryck back.\n\n\"Last season we played many games together.\n\n\"He has missed three months, but we've shown we can still play together.\"\n\nSimunovic controversially ditched Croatia for Bosnia to boost his chances of international recognition.\n\nAnd he admitted: \"It was a very big decision, but I've made it and I just want to play football.\"\n\nMeanwhile, keeper Craig Gordon couldn't give enough credit to Simunovic and Boyata for the protection they gave him against Anderlecht.\n\nAnd he reckons Celts can get better as they go on.\n\nThe veteran No1 said: \"To win 3-0 away from home against anybody is a great result.

They have some good firepower at the top end of the pitch, so it was pleasing.\n\n\"But right across the back four we defended well and that gave us the opportunity to go and get the goals we needed to win the game. We have to be able to take the ball and keep it and make sure we are looking after our possession.\n\n\"That will make the other team run about and chase the game, so when they have the ball, they won't quite have the same legs.\n\n\"Especially at the end of the game, if we've kept the ball, they will have had to do more running, so we have the chance of overpowering them in the last 15 minutes and getting another late goal.\n\n\"We got that on Wednesday night on the breakaway and it's no coincidence.\"", "The Hoops boss walked into Celtic Park 15 months ago and urged his players to silence their doubters\n\nIF there was a line of critics they would have been queued around the block.\n\nBut Brendan Rodgers walked into Celtic Park 15 months ago and urged his players to silence their doubters.\n\nIn Brussels on Wednesday night he couldn't hear a peep from the snipers.\n\nNo away win in the Champions League for five long years. Celtic hadn't ever been able to get through a match without conceding at least one goal.\n\nThose were the facts Rodgers heard time and again when he first arrived as the Hoops new boss.\n\nBut he was determined to highlight what his stars COULD do, not what they couldn't, with the stunning 3-0 win over Anderlecht a landmark night for his team.\n\nRodgers said: \"The message I gave to the players when we came in here 15 months ago was; lots of people will tell you what you CAN'T do.\n\n\"So we set about trying to focus and concentrate on breaking as many records as we could and creating our own history.\n\n\"Of course, it is very difficult but we said: 'Let's create our own history'. Celtic is an incredible club that has a great past, but we have to really concentrate on the future and not worry so much about that.\n\n\"I think over the past 12 months you can see the improvement.\n\n\"It is a huge jump in level into the Champions League, but I think it is pretty clear to see how the players are developing and improving.\n\n\"To come away and get a 3-0 victory, and play that well after such a big game last weekend, really shows how the players have grown and are believing at this level.\"\n\nIt's easy to point to Anderlecht's deficiencies as a team.\n\nSure, they are a very poor lot by Champions League standards, and they posed little threat to Celtic in Brussels.\n\nBut they are champions of Belgium, and a team that reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League last season.\n\nCeltic can only beat what's in front of them.\n\nThey have lost to poorer teams in Europe down the years, so Rodgers and his men deserve huge praise for the way they dismantled Anderlecht.\n\nIt wasn't their best European performance, and as Rodgers said after the final whistle, they can still play better.\n\nThey will need to when they face Bayern Munich in a few weeks time.\n\nBut for the time being everyone at Celtic Park should take heart from the fact the victory would have had Europe sitting up to take notice.\n\nRodgers added: \"I think people will look at this result. It is credit for the players, they deserve it. Being unbeaten in 57 games domestically is very tough to do, considering the number of matches you play and the intensity of the games.\n\n\"The players have had to stand up to that while playing at a really high level consistently.\n\n\"But of course, you then come into the Champions League.\n\n\"I think people recognise this is a good side that is developing well.\n\n\"But when you come away to a club with a great history like Anderlecht, who got to the quarter-final of the Europa League last year, then it's a step up. When we are as convincing as that I think people will say: 'Actually, they are a very good team'.\"\n\nWhat Rodgers enjoyed most of all was the attitude of the performance.\n\nRodgers said: \"Yes, there was real professionalism and the players looked like they belong at this level.\n\n\"Players comfortable on the ball, making angles, offensively looking a threat and tactically being outstanding, blocking lines of pass, really pressing the game. That was all there to see.\n\n\"That all starts from the pressure up front from Leigh Griffiths, who was outstanding. That gives me pleasure, that gives me confidence. There have been a lot of milestones along the journey, but each one you tick off is great.\n\n\"To get our first Champions League win away and to keep a clean sheet, the first in so many years, is really pleasing.\"\n\nThere's no getting away from the slackness Celtic had to begin with in the game, Olivier Ntcham having a nightmare at the start.\n\nBut then the \u00a34.5million midfielder came through it, and ended the game having set up two of the three goals.\n\nRodgers added: \"I agree, Olivier didn't make a good start to the game.\n\n\"He couldn't find his passing, and that was one of the main reasons he was playing.\n\n\"But then he found a pass that makes a difference and leads to the first goal.\n\n\"We had worked the ball really well from side to side, and then he made an absolutely sublime pass to get Kieran Tierney in behind.\n\n\"Kieran delivered a great cross and Griff finished well.\n\n\"After that Oli grew into it, he put his body on the line, got on the ball. You have to remember that he is still a young player.\"\n\nCelts now face Hibs on Saturday, with their next European game against Bayern Munich on October 18.\n\nRodgers insisted: \"I haven't even thought about it.

He needs a coach who wants him in his team, then Muller will not disappoint.\"\n\nCLUB ICONS CLAIM TIME IS UP\n\nAncelotti may have feared the worst as he digested his side's defeat in Paris, but it was not the first time in the early knockings of the season that he had contemplated his future.\n\nClub legend Stefan Effenberg warned that a repeat of the relative failings of last season would cost the Italian, while former Bayern player Mario Basler caused ripples of rumour when claiming that he had it on authority that Ancelotti would be taking a job in the Chinese Super League in January.\n\nAncelotti swiftly rubbished the suggestions, but it sowed the seeds of doubt that he would be in the hot seat long term.\n\nWho knows, a lucrative job in the Far East could now be on the table after all ...\n\nTHE FATAL PSG GAME\n\nMuller was not the only first-teamer to become disillusioned with Ancelotti's chopping and changing.\n\nFranck Ribery and Arjen Robben, so often the tandem upon which Bayern success has been built in recent years have also found themselves subject to rotation, with Ribery showing his anger when throwing down his shirt after being substituted against Anderlecht earlier this month.\n\nBoth wingers were left on the bench at the Parc des Princes, forcing Ancelotti to defend his selection, and it was Robben's reaction to the defeat which suggested the Italian had lost the faith of his players.\n\nAsked if the team were still behind Ancelotti, Robben told reporters: \"I will not answer that. I'm now in my ninth season with FC Bayern, this is something I am not accustomed to.\"", "Zenit leads Group L by three points summing a total of six from the first two games.

The national team's 1-0 success against France was still being celebrated by the time Rangers swaggered to a 3-0 win in Lyon. Closer inspection was as worthy then as it is now; on both occasions, notwithstanding the tactical nous of Alex McLeish and Walter Smith, victory was achieved against teams who dominated the ball.\n\nThere was a significance to Celtic's 3-0 win at Anderlecht on Wednesday evening that moved beyond the reinvigoration of a Champions League campaign. Celtic, while actually well short of their best, dictated proceedings against the Belgian champions. In recent European and international history, Scottish teams have not been accustomed to such displays when away from home. In the aftermath, Brendan Rodgers was happy to highlight the value of only a second Celtic away Champions League win in 28 games.\n\n\"The message I gave to the players when we came in here 15 months ago was: 'Lots of people will tell you what you can't do,'\" Celtic's manager explained. \"We set about trying to focus and concentrate on breaking as many records as we could and creating our own history. Of course, it is very, very difficult but let's create our own history. This is an incredible club that has a great past but we have to really concentrate on the future and not worry so much about that.\n\n\"I think over the past 12 months you can see the improvement. It is a huge jump in level into the Champions League but I think it is pretty clear to see how the players are developing and improving. To come away and get a 3-0 victory, play that well after such a big game at the weekend [against Rangers] really shows how the players have grown and are believing at this level.\"\n\nThose on the outside may have similar sentiment. Celtic's domestic run - they are 57 matches unbeaten - is rather taken for granted to the extent that the opposition is widely disregarded. Success on the bigger stage will lift acknowledgement of Celtic's talent and, naturally, that of Rodgers.\n\n\"Fifty-seven games domestically is very tough to do, considering the number of games you play where the opponent will always pick up the game 10-15%,\" Rodgers added. \"The players have had to stand up to that whilst playing at a really high level consistently. But of course, you come into the Champions League; I think people recognise this is a good side that is developing well but you come away to a club with a great history like Anderlecht, who got to the quarter-finals of the Europa League last year, and to come and play to that level, to be as convincing as that, I think of course people recognise that as: 'Actually, they are a very good team.'\"\n\nRodgers thus far refuses to contemplate or discuss back-to-back meetings with Bayern Munich, which should determine whether Celtic are Europa League participants after Christmas or have designs on the Champions League last 16. Beyond, that is, a general warning: \"We will get better as the group goes on.\" What can be said with confidence is that the manner of the win in Belgium has instilled fresh belief into a squad which remains relatively inexperienced in Champions League terms.\n\n\"We won, not with relative ease but with a real good professionalism, with players who look like they belong at the level,\" said Rodgers. \"And more importantly, with an actual game model that allows you to think you can at least play well at this level. Players comfortable on the ball, players making angles, offensively looking a threat and tactically they were outstanding; blocking lines of pass, really pressing the game. That all starts from the pressure up front from Leigh Griffiths, who was outstanding.\n\n\"That gives me pleasure, that gives me confidence. There have been a lot of milestones along the journey but each one you tick off is great. To get our first Champions League win away, to keep a clean sheet, the first in so many years, is really pleasing.\"\n\nRodgers altered an earlier plan to introduce Stuart Armstrong in Brussels, with the midfield substitute incurring a calf problem. Armstrong is, though, expected to be fit for the meeting with Hibernian on Saturday.

Apart from a video montage on his phone of his old mucker George Best to remind kids today what genius looked like when he was a lad, you won't hear a peep of nostalgia from him.\n\nSummerbee is deeply woven into the fabric of Manchester City, a member of the Maine Road trilogy alongside Colin Bell and Francis Lee that ended the hegemony of Law, Charlton and Best in Manchester. They were great days to be a City fan. The goals flowed, the Kippax roared, City soared and tumultuously in 1974 United were back-heeled into the Second Division by one of their own, the Lawman wearing blue.\n\nWhat could ever beat that? Well, for the Millennials among us Sergio Aguero for starters, famously sealing the title at United's expense with the last kick of the 2011/12 season. Yet, as arresting a moment as that was, there is a heightened sense now of even greater possibilities. The Pep Guardiola epoch has embraced the Premier League, and Summerbee is among those who believe City, under the Catalan educator, are touching heights never before witnessed in the English game.\n\nNo Looking Back\n\n\"The old reference points are gone. It no longer serves any purpose looking back. The game we see today bares no resemblance to the one I played, little resemblance even to what we saw at the start of the Premier League 20 years ago. The pitches, the ball, the boots. Different world. You can't tackle. Nowhere near as physical. And it is so fast. The ball comes so quickly now in tight areas. Look at David Silva. Always man of the match for me. He is never marked. He gets out of any situation.\"\n\nThese are the general elements that define elite football in 2017, but it is the particular radiance of Guardiola's contribution to which, like many, Summerbee subscribes. There is a sense of destiny unfolding, as Summerbee sees it, a richness of texture derived from the divine Barcelona School, developed at Bayern Munich and now applied at the Etihad.\n\n\"When I watch Pep training the players I'm thinking 'wow'. Last season was not the easiest. One or two players were coming to end of their contracts, others needed moving on. You watch them play now. Everyone knows what they are doing, they have confidence in what they do, they move the ball quickly, the control of the ball is unbelievable. I'm privileged to watch a lot of games. In the first couple of games they were finding their feet. Now it's frightening.\"\n\nThis commentary finds echoes in every word written about Guardiola. There is nothing in the literature devoted to him that deals with failure. It is generally a celebratory invocation designed to lay bare his gift, to offer some kind of understanding of guru Pep, the man behind the most beautiful football ever played.\n\nBest In History\n\nFair enough. The team he built at Barcelona in his four-year tenure between 2008 and 2012 is arguably the most compelling club side in history. Yes Barcelona had won the Champions League under Frank Rijkaard with Ronaldinho at his zenith but the team inherited by Guardiola was at the end of its cycle. His first act was to issue Ronaldinho his marching orders, quickly followed by Deco. Samuel Eto'o would follow 12 months later as he began to mold the template around Leo Messi. In from the B team that he led for only a season came Busquets and Pedro, talented players, but more importantly team players.\n\nTactical innovations began immediately at the team's 2008 pre-season training base at St Andrew's in Scotland where Guardiola first addressed the squad as a group and began the inculcation of ideas, laying down the general tenets of his system; dominating possession, attacking width, numerical advantage in midfield, false nine, keeper-sweeper, and so on.\n\nThe fundamental principles are known but that is not all. Guardiola brings a cultish, quasi-religious agency to arrangements that demands a buy-in from his players. Believe in me, do as I tell you, and you shall inherit the footballing earth. Guardiola exhibits absolute faith in his footballing world view and can work only with those who believe in the same purpose. Those who don't, like Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexandr Hleb, are gone.\n\nPep The Purist\n\nFor purist Pep the substratal point is the system. Get that right and the results will follow. Of course, and as he accepts, it cannot work without the resources offered by the world's great institutions, or those with aspirations to be one, which amounts to a fantastic squad of expensively assembled players working in world class facilities. I give you Barcelona, Bayern Munich and coming up fast on the rails, Manchester City.\n\nHaving worked under Malcolm Allison, Summerbee is familiar with the coach as mystic leader. He recognises in the intensity of Guardiola's obsessive approach echoes of Allison's. \"We played against Leeds in the Charity Shield, 1969. We came in at half time and Malcolm said, 'You're finished here as far as I'm concerned.\" I thought I'd done well. After the game he told me I would be training with the B team on Monday.\n\n\"He pulled me in on the Friday and said, 'right, I'm giving you one more chance. We were playing Sheffield Wednesday at home. Don Megson was playing left back for them. I think I made three and scored one. Came in after the game and Malcolm said, 'that'll do.' That was it. He got what he wanted. He knew how to get a performance out of me.\"\n\nNeedless to say Summerbee sees the same ability to cajole, massage and motivate in Guardiola but at an even more rarified level. \"He is more than 100 per cent. You thought when he came here he wouldn't be able to repeat in the Premier League what he's done elsewhere but he has. It's all falling into place for him.\n\nForce In The Game\n\n\"I have watched the training. It's totally different. You can see what he is trying to do, how the players have come in and adapted. I have never seen anything like this at City. This is a special time and Pep has created that. You have to give respect to the owner, to the sporting director Txiki Bergiristain, to the chairman etc. Since their arrival we have gone through phases but now Pep is here and we are a force in the game. And its entertaining, which is the way he wants to do it. I think other clubs will be looking at this and start to follow. People want to be entertained. \"\n\nWhile this is true, the one thing Guardiola has not done at the Etihad is put a pot in the cabinet. His failure to win the European Cup in three seasons at Munich threatened to downgrade his status despite his colonisation of the Bundesliga title. The Premier League with all its fire and brimstone represents his greatest challenge since he is up against clubs benefitting from a more equitable share of the riches plus an elite just as well resourced as City.\n\nToday he takes his creation to Stamford Bridge in what he accepts is the first real test of City's credentials. Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League last Tuesday stretched City, at times dominating Guardiola's sacred ground, the middle of the park. And as the win against Atletico Madrid showed, Chelsea have fully engaged last season's powerful rhythms.\n\nGuardiola simply has to produce. There can be no excuses, not even injuries, in the immediate case to Benjamin Mendy, or Sergio Aguero car mishaps in Holland. The Guardiola legend does not permit them. If he is the coach his disciples claim, and City the team Summerbee describes, then this is the season to prove it, starting in London this afternoon.", "On September 17, after his Manchester United demolished Everton 4-0, he praised himself, telling reporters that he took a huge risk by playing an attacking lineup.\n\n\"I think the Premier League is becoming defensive ... many teams try to play with five at the back plus two or three in the middle,\" he said. \"Two teams try to match each other and play the same system and it's 0-0 or 1-0.\"\n\nAs with all his trolling, Mourinho's pronouncement is a cleverly balanced mix of a truth, arguable assumptions, and important omissions -- all in the service of making himself look good. This time, the omission was any acknowledgement of Mourinho's career as a staunchly conservative manager. The rest of the league could decide to play with 10 at the back and it wouldn't change Mourinho's approach: building unbreakable, attack-shattering defense is what Mourinho focuses on no matter the opponent.\n\nHowever, Mourinho's point about the rise of defensive systems with three center backs and two wingbacks is unquestionably true. According to Michael Caley, this season in the Premier League, teams have started some form of back three/five 30 percent of the time. Last season, that figure was 18 percent, and in 2015-16 teams lined up that way only 4 percent of the time. Go all the way back to 2010-11, the dawn of modern soccer stats, and only 1 percent of all Premier League teams lined up with three center backs.\n\nYet, despite that rise, and despite Mourinho's claim, the league isn't necessarily getting more defensive. Goals have ticked slightly downward, with teams averaging 1.27 per game this season after averaging 1.40 last year and 1.35 the year before that. But the number of shots teams have taken has remained mostly steady with squads averaging between 12.8 and 12.9 shots over the past three seasons. The slight dip in goals seems mostly related to a league-wide conversion slump. Teams are averaging only 4.03 shots per game on target, down from 4.33 last season and 4.3 the year before that, despite basically taking the same kind of shots. By the end of the season, the goal-scoring rate should rise to the levels of the past two years.\n\nWhile the implications of a shift from four to five defenders might seem obvious -- just do the math -- the actual effects of the shift don't match up. Instead, the balance of attack and defend has broadly remained the same; it's the responsibilities of individual players that's changed.\n\nFrom Mourinho on down, we still don't quite know how to talk about the formational change that's sweeping the game. Simply shifting to three at the back won't suddenly solve a team's problems. Every back three shares certain characteristics, but every manager has to figure out how their personnel can best deal with the new issues presented by a bottom-heavy formation. This Saturday we'll get to see two managers, Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Antonio Conte at Chelsea, who have found success within the back-three revolution but have done so in profoundly different ways.\n\nThe immediate cause for the explosion of the back-three formation might be everybody copying Chelsea's success last year: After a mediocre opening six games to the season, culminating in a 3-0 loss at Arsenal, Antonio Conte switched Chelsea to a back three and promptly won 13 games straight and ran away with the league. That switch itself was a reaction to the broader tactical landscape and its vulnerabilities.\n\nModern teams rely on fullbacks to provide width in the attacking third of the field. The evolution of wingers into wide forwards, tasked with cutting inside on their stronger foot to score goals rather than staying wide to provide crosses, means that wide attacking areas are almost solely the fullback's domain. They have the inhuman task of somehow both providing attacking impetus while also not leaving space in behind them. It's a near-impossible task -- a soccer field is between 100 and 130 yards long -- and one that really only a couple of players in the world are up to. (And, of course, Pep Guardiola has coached most of them: first Dani Alves at Barcelona and then David Alaba and Philipp Lahm at Bayern Munich.)\n\nWhen a human fullback inevitably gets caught upfield, he leaves his center backs in impossible positions. Here's a particularly memorable example from Arsenal's 3-1 home loss to Monaco in the Champions League way back in 2015:\n\nThe entire disastrous cascade starts with right back H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn being all the way in Monaco's penalty area when Arsenal lose possession. What's less obvious, but equally as important, is that left back Kieran Gibbs is also in the penalty area. As the play unfolds, center back Per Mertesacker is left flailing in space without Beller\u00edn to protect him, and fails to stop the point of attack. His defensive partner, Laurent Koscielny, then has to rotate over, but without Gibbs behind him, there's simply nobody left to pick up Dimitar Berbatov and prevent him from scoring. It's exactly the kind of counterattack that playing with two advanced fullbacks leaves a team exposed to, and it's exactly what playing with a back three is supposed to help prevent.\n\nWith three defenders, even when both wingbacks are attacking the opposition's penalty area, there is still ample cover. Were Arsenal playing with a back three, after Mertesacker was beaten there would've still been two other defenders to rotate and cover. Since this requires center backs to cover untraditional ground for the position, many teams now play at least one player who isn't a pure center back. These players will often be called upon to step higher up the field toward the ball or to cover for a fullback in wide areas, so players who are defensive-minded fullbacks of defensive midfielders have taken up new roles: C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at Chelsea, Nacho Monreal at Arsenal, Geoff Cameron at Stoke, and Eric Dier at Tottenham were all hybrid players who now regularly slot into three-man defenses.\n\nThe other tactical trend that these defenses are responding to is the increased emphasis on teams attacking the half-spaces. A tactical generation ago, starting when J\u00fcrgen Klopp first led Borussia Dortmund to surprise Bundesliga titles in 2010-11 and 2011-12, attacking the half-spaces was all the rage. The idea was to attack the space between the wing and the center of the field, because it both made it harder for defenders to close off passing lanes, and also made it easier on attacking players to preserve different options. Done well, it gives a defenses fits. If a fullback pinches in to defend a player in a half-space, he leaves an entire wing open; if a center midfielder slides out, he creates a hole in the middle of the field; and if a central defender steps up, he leaves acres of space in behind. With three center backs, that problem solves itself: the middle center back worries about the middle of the field, while he left center back and right center back are each responsible for their own half-space.\n\nLike a matchup zone in basketball, which assigns specific areas for a player to patrol but then asks them to match up man-to-man within that area, soccer teams are employing a game plan that's designed to take away the spaces that new attacking schemes want to exploit.\n\nAny formational shift requires trade-offs elsewhere on the field. How teams handle these trade-offs is where the tri-center back formations start to differ. The teams facing off in this weekend's marquee Premier League match, Manchester City and Chelsea, both will play similar formations, but they'll do so for wildly different reasons.\n\nThe back three leaves teams more protected against the end of a counterattack, with that extra defender to rotate and protect the goal, but more vulnerable to the start of one. When you have one less player to do it with, it's harder to counter-press and win the ball back immediately after losing it.\n\nAt Manchester City, Guardiola basically ignores this problem by relying on an extreme attack to pin defenses back and then just press with one fewer man. If it looks like the press might get broken, they foul. City are averaging 10.7 interceptions per game according to WhoScored.com -- that's not a huge amount, 10th in the league. But, taken in concert with the fact that they have 64.7 percent of the ball, by far the most in the league, that's a huge number. They pin you deep, make you try to pass it out, and then take it away when you do. So far, the plan has worked as well as possible: City's league-leading 21 goals might be getting all the headlines, but they've been equally stellar defensively. Not only have they conceded only two goals, the fewest in the league, but they've also conceded only 41 shots, 10 fewer than any other team. (Reminder: City switch between systems a lot and these numbers encompass all of them, including the times where they play with the more traditional back four.)\n\nChelsea, on the other hand, sit and defend deeper. They only play with two real center midfielders, but those two, N'Golo Kant\u00e9 and Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko, are incredibly skilled at not only winning the ball, but at its quieter cousin: preventing ball progression. Effective defense is not always about tackling; in fact, usually it's not. Despite often being outnumbered by midfield trios, Chelsea's midfielders excel at taking away passing lanes, and making teams slow their attacks and regroup. Kant\u00e9 and Bakayoko's mastery of transitions then allows their teammates to get back behind the ball and set up a final-third defensive wall that's close to impenetrable.\n\nOnly 4 percent of the shots they concede come from inside the 6-yard box, second fewest in the league. In total, 43 percent of the shots they concede come from outside the penalty area. That's 10th overall, but the top of the list is dominated by teams from the bottom half of the table that consistently pack the box and cede possession. Chelsea's shots-outside-the-box ratio is better than those of Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, and Arsenal.\n\nThe numbers bear out the stark difference between City and Chelsea. At Statsbomb.com, Will G\u00fcrp\u0131nar-Morgan found that teams simply couldn't pass the ball against Manchester City, no matter where on the field they were. Chelsea, on the other hand, were happy to concede passes until you reached their final third, and then they simply shut it down. These are last year's stats, but the same basic principles apply this season:\n\nUltimately, City use their hyper-aggressive pressing system and successfully gamble that pressured defenders won't be able to play passes to the midfielders City leaves open. Chelsea rely on a couple of special players to slow the opposition down while the defense builds its fortress around the penalty area.\n\nThe two teams are also as different as can be in attack. Playing an extra defender means sacrificing a player somewhere else on the field, and then figuring out how to make up for that sacrifice. Chelsea rely on the passing of their back three to keep the attack humming. Since neither Kant\u00e9 nor Bakoyoko is a difference-making passer, Chelsea uses David Luiz and Azpilicueta to create with the ball at their feet. Azpilicueta has four assists, all to striker \u00c1lvaro Morata. He often steps far enough into midfield to cross the ball to the striker lurking off of defenders' back shoulders.\n\nLuiz, meanwhile, handles the brunt of the responsibility for the forward passing that the midfield lacks. Chelsea often moves the ball upfield through Luiz finding a pass to a forward and bypassing the midfield entirely.\n\nGuardiola, on the other hand, would likely rather have several body parts surgically removed than build an attack around a center back playing directly to a forward. In contrast to Chelsea, City pack the midfield with Fernandinho, Kevin De Bruyne, and David Silva. When City play with a back three, they don't ask their center backs to play risky longer passes to open up defenses. Rather, they ask them to carry the ball forward, draw defenders to them, and create the pockets of space for midfielders to slip into and receive the ball. City's defenders play tons of passes. Of players that have played at least three games, John Stones, Nicolas Otamendi, and Vincent Kompany are first, second, and fifth among defenders in completed passes per 90 minutes -- all while completing over 90 percent of their passes.\n\nBoth Manchester City and Chelsea have clear plans for how to best utilize their personnel to mitigate the effects of adding a defender -- and to make this formation work, that holistic approach is necessary. Tottenham, for example, employ an aggressive press somewhat similar to City's, but they have an attack that falls somewhere between City and Chelsea: one defender, Jan Vertonghen, strides forward with the ball at his feet, while Toby Alderweireld plays long and direct passes. The result: Spurs can manage a dangerous attack despite sometimes playing as many as six players who might be classified as defenders. Arsenal, on the other hand, have struggled to figure out the right balance, especially on the defensive side of the ball. As has often been the case for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team no matter what formation and personnel they play, their midfield gets overrun against the better teams in the league. Without the supercharged defensive skills of Chelsea's midfield, the Gunners need a better plan for protecting the center of the field, where they are frequently outnumbered.\n\nAs teams increasingly deploy a back three across the Premier League, their success or failure will be dictated not by whether they play that way, but by how they do it. Teams like Chelsea and Manchester City can play differently and both have success: Chelsea won the league last year by seven points, while Manchester City have a plus-19 goal differential through six games. But switching to a back three isn't a magic bullet. Done right, it can allow players with previously undervalued skill sets to shine, and fill in the positional cracks that many teams find themselves stuck with when playing a back four. Done poorly, it's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic: The piece are all in new places, but the problems still haven't gone away.", "The champions welcome the league leaders to the Bridge for a tea-time meeting. The mouths of club historian Rick Glanvill and club statistician Paul Dutton are already watering...\n\nTALKING POINTS\n\nNot been a bad few weeks for the Blues, has it? Five wins from six games, and 19 goals scored on three different fronts. Now comes the seventh match of a hectic month ahead of the two-week break for international fixtures.\n\nWe beat Manchester City home and away last season on the way to becoming champions, Antonio Conte becoming the first coach to fashion a league double over former Barcelona and Bayern man Pep Guardiola. The Catalan has yet to coach his team to victory against a Chelsea side in open play (the 2013 UEFA Super Cup ended in a 2-2 draw, with penalties deciding it in Bayern Munich's favour).\n\nThe visitors arrive after their second best Premier League start (after last season) in terms of points, and their most successful when it comes to goal difference, with 21 scored and two conceded.\n\nChelsea's task is to staunch the Mancunians' flow and puncture their armour, much like the historic performance in Madrid this week. It is the sustained intensity of Wednesday's performance and its drain on his team that will occupy Conte however. For what is potentially a season-defining showdown, it seems unfair that TV scheduling has handed such an advantage to the visitors.\n\nThe Blues, who returned from the Spanish capital in the early hours of Thursday and had a light training session later the same morning, will have had just two days' recovery and preparation time in between demanding fixtures. The Citizens played a day earlier, and at home. A Sunday kick-off would have levelled things up considerably.\n\nChelsea were the last team to beat Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nChelsea inflicted Atletico's first-ever home defeat (12 matches) to English opposition in UEFA competition and are unbeaten in 10 games over twelve years on Spanish soil. In 2007, the Blues became the first English side to win at Valencia's Mestalla, also with an injury-time strike from Michael Essien.\n\nWednesday was one of the finest games in the club's European history. A gracious Diego Simeone admitted his team were beaten in their casa nueva by a Chelsea side who were 'tactically, technically and physically' better. The performance is now a yardstick by which all others can be measured this season.\n\nThe achievement is all the more remarkable for the Blues coming from behind: Atletico, second in La Liga, are notoriously tough hosts and have conceded just two equalising goals at home in the league since 2015/16.\n\nThe poise and prowess leading to both goals was especially impressive. There were 13 passes by the visitors covering most of the pitch before the Eden Hazard's wicked cross created Morata's deft header.\n\nAnd on the last-kick winner, when many teams would have either drawn out the final 15 seconds or flung the ball into the 'mixer', the Blues spatchcocked the hosts with nine touches from seven different players: Andreas Christensen, Willian, N'Golo Kante, Victor Moses, Marcos Alonso, Tiemoue Bakayoko and, of course, Michy Batshuayi.\n\nA post shared by Chelsea FC! \u1f3c6 (@chelseafc) on Sep 28, 2017 at 8:22am PDT\n\nThis was remarkable vindication of Antonio Conte's tactical versatility, as well as his handling of Eden Hazard's rehabilitation after serious injury. The Belgian was impish and irresistible, drawing opposition defenders towards him like iron filings to a magnet.\n\nHis burgeoning combinations with Alvaro Morata, the Swiss army knife of finishing, were a thing to savour and it is the Hispanic influence that is triumphant at present: after the Madrid jaunt, a Spaniard has scored or set up 17 of Chelsea's past 18 goals.\n\nMorata's opener at Stoke, clocked at 82 seconds, is the second fastest goal in the Premier League this season. The no.9 will have to strike even faster to be among our quickest goalscorers in the Premier League era (see below). And the swiftest ever, by Keith Weller against Middlesbrough in the League Cup at the Bridge on 7 October 1970, hit the net after just 12 seconds.\n\nLast weekend's 4-0 scoreline matched our all-time biggest victory away to Stoke, and Morata's hat-trick was our first on their ground, the first by a Blues player in the league since Diego Costa at Swansea three years ago the same month, and the 17th in the Premier League for the west Londoners.\n\nMorata's was the second hat-trick in succession after Batshuayi's against Qarabag. The last time Chelsea players registered hat-tricks in consecutive matches was in the days of Ruud Gullit's 'sexy football': 29 November 1997 (Chelsea 4 Derby 0 and Gianfranco Zola) and 6 December 1997 (Tottenham 1 Chelsea 6 and Tore Andre Flo).\n\nPopular centre-forward Mark Hughes scored in the first of those games and was benched for the second, but as a coach he now has the least successful record of any former player against the Blues, losing on 20 occasions.\n\nOnly Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes (22), and Harry Redknapp and Arsene Wenger (21) have tasted defeat more times against Chelsea.\n\nRoma clung on for a 2-1 away win over Qarabag in Baku in the other Group C match, watched by a 67,200 crowd The Olympic Stadium, where the Horsemen are playing games, will host the 2019 Europa League final\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea Ladies, who started their WSL campaign with a thumping 6-0 win at the new Kingsmeadow base, are at Sunderland on Saturday night then start their own European adventure on Wednesday 4 October with a Champions League Round of 32 match at home to Bayern Munich.\n\nInformation on tickets here\n\nThe best that can happen this weekend...\n\nLevel with the leaders heading into the international break.\n\nThere has been plenty of partying in the stands this month so it is fitting that travelling Chelsea supporters came up with a splendid song for Tiemoue Bakayoko and N'Golo Kante adapted from the '70s disco-funk classic 'September' by Earth, Wind & Fire, with its 'ba-dee-ya' chorus.\n\nIt is right to chastise the perpetrators when a song gives offence, so the terrace wordsmiths responsible for this wholly positive contribution deserve praise. The challenge now is to fit a player's name to 'Boogie Wonderland'\n\nBefore Saturday's match a stone ledger will be unveiled on the grave of Jack Whitley, who served Chelsea as goalie and then first team trainer for 32 years. His final resting place in Brompton Cemetery, adjacent to Stamford Bridge, went unmarked and unnoticed until a chance rediscovery a few years back.\n\nA crowdfund, set up to place a memorial to the only known Chelsea player buried 'next door', achieved its \u00a35,500 goal within weeks thanks to the generosity of Blues supporters, and even those of other clubs.\n\nAt 12 midday in the north-east corner of Brompton Cemetery, there will be a short ceremony to unveil the memorial with some family members. Jack kept Chelsea's first-ever clean sheet in the top flight in September 1907. As guests of the club at the match, let us hope his descendants witness the same outcome in his honour.\n\nFinally, friends and family of lifelong Chelsea fan Denis Murphy, 56, one of those who so tragically lost their life in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 will also attend this weekend's game. They have asked if supporters would join them in celebrating Denis's life by applauding in the 56th minute.\n\nSaturday\n\nHuddersfield v Tottenham 12.30pm - Sky Sports\n\nBournemouth v Leicester 3pm\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace 3pm\n\nStoke v Southampton 3pm\n\nWest Brom v Watford 3pm\n\nWest Ham v Swansea 3pm\n\nChelsea v Manchester City 5.30pm - BT Sport\n\nSunday\n\nArsenal v Brighton 12 noon - BT Sport\n\nEverton v Burnley 2.15pm - Sky Sports\n\nNewcastle v Liverpool 4.30pm - Sky Sports\n\nPremier League top scorers\n\nSergio Aguero (Man City) 6\n\nAlvaro Morata (Chelsea) 6\n\nRomelu Lukaku (Man Utd) 6\n\nRaheem Sterling (Man City) 5\n\nJamie Vardy (Leicester) 5\n\nPremier League table - top six\n\nLast Updated: 04:00, Fri 29 Sep\n\nVisit again later for more of the Briefing.\n\nChelsea FC NEWS", "Man Utd branded a long-ball team in sly dig by City boss Guardiola\n\nManchester United have been branded direct and in favour of a long-ball approach by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nJose Mourinho has forged a reputation down the years for making his sides difficult to beat, with the Portuguese having sought to blend graft with guile from Porto to United via Chelsea, Inter and Real Madrid.\n\nCity 10/11 to take PL crown\n\nHis methods have not always been well received, but he has always delivered results.\n\nMourinho has United level with City in the 2017-18 Premier League title race, but Guardiola has suggested that is down to adopting a more English approach than that embraced by the likes of his City side and fellow contenders for the crown, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss told The Premier League Show: \"[A more direct style] doesn't hold England back - you see the national team, [John] Stones, [Kyle] Walker, [Dele] Alli, [Jordan] Henderson, [Adam] Lallana - these are players who want to play.\n\n\"I see Chelsea, I see Tottenham - they like to play [but] at Manchester United you have the second balls.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether that comment was \"a little dig\" at City's arch-rivals, Guardiola replied: \"I have a lot of respect for my neighbours.\"\n\nWhatever his motives for questioning the approach of others, Guardiola insists that he will never waver in his own philosophy - with the man credited with forging the famous 'tiki-taka' brand of football at Barcelona prepared to keep prioritising both style and substance.\n\nHe added: \"In Spain, the value of the ball is so important.

Happily for Celtic fans, the Northern Irishman is under no threat, by contrast to Rene Weiler and Carlo Ancelotti, who began the season in charge of Anderlecht and Bayern Munich respectively but who have been numbered amongst the early casualties of disappointing form.\n\nIn Weiler's case, a poor start to the Belgian league season saw him gone before Anderlecht lost to Celtic in their Champions League group encounter on Wednesday while Bayern parted company with Ancelotti on Thursday after the Bundesliga club lost by the same score to Paris Saint-Germain in the other game in the section.\n\n\"Carlo will probably go to Barcelona or somewhere, but my feelings this week were for Jim McIntyre and Peter Houston,\" said Rodgers, of the men sacked by Ross County and Falkirk. \"I didn't really see or understand the role Jim played at Ross County until I came to Celtic.\n\n\"I then analysed what he'd done - winning the League Cup and keeping them up. Roy MacGregor [the Staggies' chairman] is a lovely guy and has done brilliant work for Ross County and the area, but I have real empathy for Jim losing his job. \"Look at the work he's done and the fixtures he's had. They've played ourselves, Aberdeen, Rangers and Hibs. I watched the full game last week and it wasn't a performance where you say the players aren't really playing for him.\n\n\"I have real empathy for Jim and Peter Houston, who has been about for a long time.

That's no disrespect to Bolton - if they'd been in the Premier League, it would have been a great job. I felt Neil was a Premier League manager in waiting.\n\n\"Maybe that's because I know the size of Celtic and what the demands and challenges are at a club like this. I could see how he'd managed that and looked at what could be his next step.\n\n\"Part of my admiration for him comes from his openness and the courage he showed to come out and speak openly about his depression.

It's just the window of this week.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed for the boys because I see what it means to them.\n\n\"When I speak with the players, ALL the Scotland boys want to go with Scotland.\n\n\"That's not always the case at international level. I've had experiences in my managerial career where players don't want to go with their countries.\n\n\"But all the boys want to go with Scotland. They enjoy the environment they are in with Gordon, Mark McGhee and the staff, and secondly they are very patriotic.\n\n\"They want to do well for Scotland. And of course when there is an influx of them there you want them to do well because they are representing their club side as well.\n\n\"And I also look and see the time that's gone by since Scotland last qualified.\n\n\"I would like Scotland to do well as a nation and get back to producing players and getting back to some of these finals.\"", "The time to assess a team is \"over a glass of wine\", Pep Guardiola said, but ahead of Manchester City's potentially momentous meeting with Chelsea there was a clear-headed verdict from him on how much the fixture meant and the ideological differences between the two sides.\n\n\"It is a big chance to see what we are,\" Guardiola declared. The Premier League leaders are taking on the reigning champions who will draw level with them on points if they win at Stamford Bridge but City can open up a six-point gap if they leave with an away victory.\n\nGuardiola said he recognised similarities between his philosophy and Antonio Conte's and admired the Chelsea head coach's tactical sense and management. But he went on to explain that there was a significant difference - his insistence that his teams dominate possession had not wavered since \"what I tried with Barcelona second team, in the fourth division\".\n\nThe City manager praised Chelsea for their \"machine\" like approach to football and their \"killer\" instinct in front of goal but confirmed it is not a tactical approach he wants to follow himself. It had a touch of Cavalier versus Roundhead.\n\n\"The best way to explain what we are at Manchester City is with a glass of wine in front of the TV and watch the team play,\" Guardiola said. \"When I see Conte it's like a team that he has to defend compact, 10 players, and after use the counter-attack like a machine with Pedro, Willian, [Eden] Hazard, [Alvaro] Morata, [Diego] Costa in the past. When they can attack, they can attack.\n\nPep Guardiola discusses Sergio Aguero's car crash 00:47\n\n\"They've been strong since a long time ago, Chelsea. They are all tall and strong. They are a really good team. One of the best teams in Europe. It's a big chance to see what we are. It's a good test for us against the last champions of the Premier League.\"\n\nThere is one curious statistic also that adds to Guardiola's admiration - and frustration - with Chelsea. In seven matches against them the 46-year-old is yet to record a victory - apart from the Super Cup win in 2013 on penalties when he was Bayern Munich coach.\n\nGuardiola added: \"Especially what I like the most is they don't create a lot of chances. They shoot four times and score four goals against Tottenham [in the FA Cup semi-final]. When this happens it means a lot, it's a top team. They have that ability - they are killers when they have one chance - one goal. That's why they're a good team.\"\n\nCity's inability to be \"killers\" last season was, Guardiola has stated, their biggest downfall as they failed to capitalise on the chances they created. A golf enthusiast, the Spaniard has privately likened it to constantly making the greens but then putting \"bogey, bogey, bogey\" instead of \"birdie, birdie, birdie\".\n\nAnd that became most apparent against Chelsea when the two sides met last December in what was probably the most consequential fixture of the campaign. The 3-1 defeat at the Etihad, in which Fernandinho and Sergio Ag\u00fcero were sent off, hurt City and Guardiola and strengthened Chelsea.\n\n\"That game was a key point, we went four points down and a lot of things happened,\" Guardiola said. \"A lot of things affected the future. We didn't overcome it at that moment...Hopefully we can learn about that, we like to fight when we have troubles and show what we can do. We're in September, people say it's a perfect condition, in the Premier League and Champions League, but it's September, but what I want to see is how we react.\"\n\nIt will also be instructive to see how Guardiola reacts to the injuries suffered by Ag\u00fcero and Benjamin Mendy. Without Ag\u00fcero will he abandon playing twin strikers and go with his natural instinct of just using Gabriel Jesus? Will he deploy Raheem Sterling more centrally - or not at all? And will he stick with a four-man defence against Chelsea who have shown flexibility under Conte to combat and stifle their strongest opponents? Chelsea did that, twice, last season against City and already this campaign Conte has thickened his midfield against Spurs and also this week at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a victory that was hailed by Guardiola as an important one for the Premier League.\n\nWith Morata and, behind him, Hazard Chelsea also have a burgeoning partnership which allows Conte to move away from the 3-4-3 formation which was so successful last season but which was eventually countered.\n\nChelsea are also depleted, not least with the suspension of David Luiz, but this feels more about how City and Guardiola react to adversity - and whether he is willing to adapt. \"We want to become a big club, I've been at two amazing clubs in my life [Barcelona and Bayern Munich] ... you have to overcome this situation,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"I'd like to play with Sergio but he's not there, no complaints. We'll go there and play the way we'd have done it with Sergio, Kompany, Mendy. We have to overcome these situations. The big clubs do it - they overcome the difficult situations.\n\n\"We've broken two pieces, how do we react? It's always difficult at Stamford Bridge, the last champions of the Premier League. Always complicated. How we react in that situation is what I want to see. If people are saying we can't do it now, we'll never reach what we want in the next five or six years.\"", "Danish defender has plenty of big-game experience after a long loan spell in Germany and will start in the heart of the backline against Manchester City\n\nAndreas Christensen may still be forging a reputation in the Premier League but, when it comes to confrontations with Manchester City, he can at least call upon personal experience in preparation. During a two-season spell on loan at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach there were four collisions with these opponents, contests decorated by Sergio Ag\u00fcero's goals, with each an education for the Dane. \"They were Champions League matches, big games against the best players,\" said the centre-half. \"It was what I wanted and good for me. But will it help me for this match? I don't know because, now, they know more about me as well.\"\n\nThat was said with a smile, but it is a measure of Christensen's underlying quality that it does not feel risky that a key member of a M\u00f6nchengladbach team who shipped 11 goals in those four group games to City will start at the heart of the Chelsea defence against the same opponents on Saturday. A centre-back who was guided through his first Premier League start, a daunting trip to Tottenham Hotspur in August, by David Luiz in central midfield and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at his side has long since demonstrated his quality to his team-mates. The 21-year-old, sitting in the middle of the back three as David Luiz completes a suspension, is a youngster living up to immense potential.\n\nAntonio Conte spied the pedigree in the first training session of pre-season after which, according to Christensen's father, Steen, he told the sporting director Michael Emenalo: \"Andreas is even better live than on the television\". The Italian spoke of the youngster's \"maturity and experience\" on Friday, but Chelsea have long since recognised the talent in a player schooled at Brondby before joining the academy at Cobham in February 2012. That time in Germany merely sped up his development.\n\n\"I knew teams wanted me on loan, but that a two-year [arrangement] would be more appropriate for me,\" he said. \"I wanted one year to settle in and establish myself and another to play regularly and really go for it.\n\n\" It was two seasons at a high level. Chelsea kept looking after me, getting the videos and texting every day about how I was doing. Eddie Newton and Paulo Ferreira did a great job with me. Facing the strikers in the Bundesliga and two years in the Champions League as well got me so much experience. The club could not have done any more than they did in terms of helping me on the right path. But, as a player, you have to take responsibility for yourself as well and do what is best for you. You can't expect everything to be given to you and you have to perform when you get the chance. I grew up a bit too, looking after myself. The whole thing was a life experience.\"\n\nHis game progressed at pace. Borussia integrated him in a back three at first before resorting to a four. Christensen was integral regardless of the system, making 62 Bundesliga starts and claiming the club's player of the year award in his first campaign. He was a member of the side that defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 in December 2015 and, aside from those tussles with City, also confronted Barcelona and Juventus in the Champions League.\n\nElegant in possession, unflustered and eager to venture into midfield with the ball, the Denmark international's return to England this summer might explain why Chelsea were not quite so infuriated to miss out on John Stones when the Everton defender transferred to City in 2016. They knew they already had a centre-back returning to their ranks.\n\nChristensen will become only the fifth Chelsea academy graduate in almost 15 years to start at least three Premier League games for the club, with the champions having always envisaged him playing his part this year. The Dane's own ambitions were not checked by the purchase of Antonio R\u00fcdiger from Roma. Indeed, he had watched his parent club sign defenders regularly over his two years in Germany. \"It was probably only before I went on holiday this summer that I wondered if I'd get a chance,\" he said. \"But the manager showed me he trusts me and he has a great passion for me to deliver. I've been involved pretty much from the start so, right now, I'm happy.\n\n\"When I was first at Chelsea as a first-team player [under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2014-15] I wasn't even in the squad all the time. You always have to go and look at the list and sometimes you are in the squad and sometimes not. Now I feel much more like a Chelsea player. It's a new staff and they need to get to know me, but I'm getting a lot of playing time and I have to keep going and show I am entitled to more.\"\n\nHe is meriting inclusion at present. No other visiting player completed as many passes as Christensen's 75 from 78 attempts at Stoke last weekend, offering an indication of his comfort in possession and lending itself to those comparisons with Stones. \"That could be fair,\" he added. \"The manager wants everyone to take responsibility on the ball and, if that means stepping out from the back, that's what we will do. I enjoy it.\n\n\"I was facing top strikers in the Bundesliga and that was a new thing for me. Then it was Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Manchester City in the Champions League and they made it difficult for us. But it helped me understand what will hopefully come more often in the future, and that's something I'm looking forward to. I want to play against the top, top strikers.\" Chelsea are confident that, when he does, he will excel.", "Sergio Ag\u00fcero's car accident and the loss of Benjamin Mendy to injury are two severe blows but manager is not interested in excuses\n\nEarly Friday morning and Pep Guardiola is receiving a second piece of terrible team news before Manchester City's pivotal trip to Chelsea for Saturday's late match.\n\nSergio Ag\u00fcero, who has scored seven goals in eight appearances, has been injured in a car accident in Amsterdam and is ruled out of the game with a broken rib. Twenty-four hours earlier the left-back Benjamin Mendy, the \u00a352m summer signing whose attacking flair has injected pace and potency into City, was diagnosed with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, making him unavailable until most likely April.\n\nCity have made a flying start to the campaign, winning eight of their nine games. They are Premier League leaders and top their Champions League group. Yet as Guardiola bills the fixture with Chelsea as key to City's title aspirations, the Ag\u00fcero-Mendy double whammy could not arrive at a worse time.\n\nThe manager's hope is that his side can be inspired by the setback and help his quest to make City as powerful as Bayern Munich and Barcelona, the two teams he previously managed.\n\n\"We want to become a big club. I've been at two amazing clubs in my life and you have to overcome this situation,\" he says. \"If we start to complain we'll never reach the step we want to take. I prefer to play with men who are strong. I'd like to play with Sergio because we are strong with him. But he's not there, no complaints. We'll go there and play the way we'd have done it with Sergio, [Vincent] Kompany [also out], Mendy. We have to overcome these situations if you want to become a team that others consider big and say it doesn't matter what happens.\n\n\"The big clubs do it. They overcome the difficult situations. We've broken two pieces [in Ag\u00fcero and Mendy], it's how do we react. It's always difficult at Stamford Bridge, the last champions of the Premier League, always complicated. If people are saying we can't do it now, then we'll never reach what we want in the next five or six years.\"\n\nGabriel Jesus's form has been as excellent as that of Ag\u00fcero, the Brazilian registering five times in eight appearances. Given this and how Guardiola dropped the Argentinian for Jesus last season, it suggests the loss of Ag\u00fcero may not be as crucial as that of Mendy.\n\nBefore the injury the Frenchman had featured in five of the eight victories and given City an extra dimension, his strong personality also bolstering team spirit. Guardiola believes Mendy is unique and that he will have to tinker with City's approach at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\"We can't replace him - in the way he plays, the way he goes up and down, you can't,\" says the head coach. \"We have to do it in a different way. Nobody in the world has his energy, his mood on the pitch, in the locker room. But we have other qualities in other players and we have to find a balance.\"\n\nGuardiola is conscious how last year's first meeting with Antonio Conte's side proved season-defining. Rewind to last December and he was left a deeply frustrated manager at the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium. The 46-year-old had witnessed City losing 3-1 and Ag\u00fcero and Fernandinho being sent off in an angry end to the defeat.\n\nGuardiola could not believe how City allowed a contest they dominated to slip away. Later he described it as a \"pity\" and apologised for the red cards but the unpalatable truth was that Conte's men handed his side a lesson in how to seize the moment and the points. Despite pinning Chelsea back throughout City spurned several chances with the usually cool-eyed Kevin De Bruyne a chief culprit. Instead two break-away strikes from Willian and Eden Hazard were decisive and Chelsea returned home jubilant.\n\nCity had entered the contest only a point behind Chelsea but the defeat precipitated a dreadful December. They went down in their next league outing, 4-2 at Leicester City, and then again on New Year's Eve, 1-0 at Liverpool. It left City entering January trailing Chelsea by 10 points and their championship aspirations all but over.\n\n\"That was a key point,\" reflects Guardiola. \"We went four points behind Chelsea and a lot of things happened. Fernandinho sent off, Ag\u00fcero was punished and we lost him. We dropped a lot of points. It was a big point in the season. A lot of things affected the future. We didn't overcome it at that moment. It was a good moment to see if we were able. But that was last season.\"\n\nGuardiola knows that, if the result can be reversed in west London on Saturday then City will take charge of their destiny in the same way Chelsea did 10 months ago.\n\n\"Hopefully we can learn. We're in September, people say we're in a perfect condition, in the Premier League and Champions League, but it's September. I want to see how we react,\" he says.\n\n\"I admire many things about what Chelsea do, the manager, the way they play. They can play amazing counterattack, set pieces, they defend deep then attack. They control all the aspects of football. That's why they won the Premier League. They were able to win three days ago in one of the toughest stadiums in the world [at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]. Especially what I like the most is they don't create a lot of chances.\n\n\"They shoot four times and score four goals against Tottenham [in the FA Cup semi-final last season]. When this happens it means a lot; it's a top team. They have that ability. They are killers when they have one chance, one goal. That's why they're a good team.\"\n\nGuardiola's point about Chelsea's counterattack is pertinent given how Willian and Hazard breached City this way last year. Following a serious injury Hazard turned in a dazzling display in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Atl\u00e9tico. His understanding with \u00c1lvaro Morata led to the latter's opener, and of the No9 Guardiola says: \"He is similar to [Diego] Costa, very good at set pieces, technically a fantastic player.\"\n\nMendy's loss is compounded by that of Kompany, whose continued absence with a calf problem means Guardiola has only John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi as front-line central defenders. Before Sadio Man\u00e9 was sent off for Liverpool in City's 5-0 win at the Etihad earlier this month Otamendi was shown to be vulnerable to pace by the visitors' Mohamed Salah.\n\nAs Guardiola states, City will adopt a different style against Chelsea because of Mendy's unavailability. Last year he matched up to Conte with three centre-backs and Jes\u00fas Navas and Leroy San\u00e9 as wing-backs. This time Kyle Walker will operate on the right and Danilo may be preferred on the other side to Fabian Delph, a midfielder by trade but who has recently played at left-back.\n\nWhat is clear is the test Guardiola faces. It is precisely the kind he was employed for and there can be no argument the hierarchy have not backed him, after a \u00a3227m summer investment.\n\nBeat Chelsea and self-belief will be sky-high and Guardiola's man-management in a difficult week should be lauded. Lose and questions will be asked of him as to whether City really are any different from last season's vintage whose resolve was found wanting when needed most.", "Bayern Munich seems ready to offer Thomas Tuchel the dream job of almost every German soccer coach.\n\nTalks are underway between Bayern Munich and Tuchel over becoming the German club's next head coach, according to Bild's Christian Falk and Sportsbuzzer's Heiko Ostendorp.\n\nBayern fired Carlo Ancelotti on Thursday and appears to be moving quickly to secure Tuchel as his permanent successor. Willy Sagnol, an ex-Bayern player and assistant on Ancelotti's staff, will lead the team in Saturday's Bundesliga (German league) game against Hertha Berlin.\n\nBayern Munich won't play again until Oct. 14 due to the FIFA international break, and Tuchel could be its new head coach by then.\n\nTuchel, 44, is currently out of work but he's still one of Germany's most highly regarded coaches. He most recently spent two seasons at Borussia Dortmund, leading the club to second- and third-place finishes in 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively. Dortmund also reached the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League last season, further bolstering Tuchel's reputation.", "End mouth is here\u00e2\u0080| Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you all love it when payday falls on a weekend?

You can say the NBA should form a true minor league.\n\nStill, this is a college basketball issue. These criminal accusations happened in college basketball and not the NBA.\n\nThe NBA is not responsible for college coaches' putting so much emphasis on winning that they get into under-the-table bidding wars for kids who don't actually want to be students.\n\nJust because NBA rules prevent kids from jumping directly from high school does not mean colleges have to accept them with open arms for their one-year pit stop. College coaches know most of these kids have no true allegiance to their program, but they do it anyway.\n\nThat's on college basketball -- not the NBA.\n\nTonight's schedule TV/Radio\n\nBaseball\n\nMets at Phillies, 7 p.m. (CSN;

Vincenzo Montella is coming under pressure very early this season, and both the Milan boss and his players must step up and silence the doubters.\n\nTen wins in 12 games in all competitions so far this season, including Europa League qualifiers, would suggest that Montella is doing a stellar job. However, it doesn't tell the whole story as the level of opposition must be taken into account.\n\nThe Rossoneri have cantered to comfortable wins over the likes of Shkendija and Austria Wien, and at times they've looked very impressive. Having had to integrate 11 new players over the summer in a rebuilt squad with high expectations, it was never going to be easy.\n\nHowever, when the opposition has stepped up, notably in trips to Lazio and Sampdoria, Milan haven't been able to match them, and in turn it has raised serious questions about Montella's ability to coach this side to success, and about the players who have disappointed and must share the blame.\n\nLooking deeper into the results, Milan only just scraped through with a win over Rijeka on Thursday night, needed two penalties to see off SPAL and had Suso to thank for a moment of magic in the win over Cagliari.\n\nMany supporters still believe that Montella is the man to take the club forward, and these problems were to be expected with such a dramatically changed side early in the campaign. However, others argue that they've already seen enough struggles to determine that Milan won't get to where they want to be with him at the helm.\n\nHis situation wasn't helped with Carlo Ancelotti's sacking this week by Bayern Munich, as the Milan hero is still highly revered by supporters after such successful stints with the club both as a player and a coach. In turn, it ramps up the pressure on the current boss to get things right, as it seems as though a possible replacement is suddenly back on the market.\n\nHowever, it's surely too early to be discussing Montella's future. The defeat at Lazio was a capitulation either side of half-time and while it was wholly unacceptable, it can be forgiven to an extent in that it was an almost unexplainable collapse that Milan can learn from.\n\nIn contrast, though, the Sampdoria loss was a real cause for concern as it raised doubts over Montella's tactics and ability to change a game, and the players certainly didn't cover themselves in glory, either.\n\nSpeaking of those players, their coach needs more from them, too. Leonardo Bonucci is not performing at the level that we've grown used to seeing from him in past years, and various other individuals need to step up, take on leadership roles and drag Milan to better performances if need be.\n\nNevertheless, it's still a vicious cycle in that Montella can be blamed for various issues. From refusing to rest Franck Kessie to rotating the likes of Andre Silva, Hakan Calhanoglu and Giacomo Bonaventura in and out of the team, offering them no real chance of continuity and consistency.\n\nWhile he has options and needs to keep everyone happy and fresh, this is the time for Montella to put out his best team and build a formidable group capable of competing on all fronts. The international break follows the Roma game, so there are no excuses when it comes to putting out a strong lineup with those who have impressed thus far.\n\nIt's never nice to lose and is unacceptable for Milan, but if the result doesn't arrive on Sunday evening, then so be it. But we can't see a repeat of the display that we saw against Sampdoria, which showed a Milan side devoid of commitment, desire, invention and charisma, looking inferior and failing to even threaten to score.\n\nRoma are a direct rival for a Champions League qualification spot this season and have a settled squad with many top-class players. It won't be easy, but Milan must now prove that they can go toe to toe with a top side.\n\nSeeing off SPAL, Shkendija and Crotone is all well and good, but falling short against Lazio and possibly Roma, with the Milan derby to come, is simply not good enough.", "What to watch in the leading soccer leagues in Europe this weekend:\n\nIt's going to be a fascinating and potentially close-run race for top scorer in the English Premier League this season, with the four leading contenders - Harry Kane, Romelu Lukaku, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Morata - all showing great form after six games.\n\nTwo of them go head to head this weekend.\n\nMorata's Chelsea, which is in third place, hosts Aguero's Manchester City, which leads on goal difference, on Saturday in the signature match of the seventh round. Both strikers have six goals, a league-high tally along with Lukaku.\n\nLukaku has a great chance to add to his total, with second-place Manchester United at home to last-place Crystal Palace. Palace conceded five goals at City last weekend.\n\nKane has scored 19 goals in his last nine away games for club and country ahead of his Tottenham team's visit to promoted Huddersfield.\n\nOf the other possible title contenders, Arsenal is at home to Brighton and Liverpool travels to Newcastle for a match between coach Rafa Benitez's past and present teams, respectively.\n\nBarcelona's home game against struggling Las Palmas on Sunday won't be only about football, coming on the same day as a planned referendum for Catalonia's independence from Spain.\n\nThe club and some of its top players have shown their support for the vote, which Spain's government says is unconstitutional. Separatists have often used the Camp Nou stadium as a rallying point, and it will likely happen again on Sunday.\n\nBarcelona has won its first six matches. Las Palmas, which has lost two straight games, is expected to have newly hired coach Pako Ayestaran on the bench for the first time.\n\nSecond-place Atletico Madrid, coming off a last-minute home loss to Chelsea in the Champions League, visits Leganes on Saturday, while third-place Sevilla hosts winless Malaga earlier in the day.\n\nOn Sunday, sixth-place Real Madrid hosts Espanyol, which has won two of its last three matches.\n\nBayern Munich interim coach Willy Sagnol begins the task of restoring battered pride at Hertha Berlin on Sunday.\n\nFormer assistant coach Sagnol, who won five Bundesliga titles as a player with Bayern, has been handed the reins following Carlo Ancelotti's sacking on Thursday.\n\nBayern's 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday was the last straw for the 58-year-old Italian, already under scrutiny from club bosses for a lackluster start to the season. Bayern, the five-time defending champion, is already three points behind Borussia Dortmund after six games.\n\nDortmund, which is enjoying its joint-best start to the league, next visits Augsburg on Saturday. Augsburg is unbeaten in five games.\n\nDortmund has five wins and a draw from six rounds, conceding only one goal despite looking frail at times at the back and scoring 19.

It's the kind of big grand touring coupe we rarely see anymore. It's almost as if whoever designed it had a special love for the original 8 Series from the 1990s. Turns out that's the case after all, and if you've ever wondered what it's like to remake your favorite car for the modern age, check this out.\n\nJohn Buckingham, the designer of the new BMW 8 Series Concept, had a favorite car growing up: the BMW E31, otherwise known as the first-generation of the 8 Series, which BMW built from 1989-1999.\n\nLast August, Buckingham met a perfectly-preserved red E31 in person for the first time in a long time.

It looks like they've found exactly the right person to bring it back.", "Car parts of the future could be made out of a surprising material. Wood.\n\nResearchers in Japan are working to create a strong material out of wood pulp that could replace steel parts in vehicles within a decade.\n\nWork is also charging ahead in the country to develop plastics that can withstand high temperatures, to replace metal for parts near the engine.\n\nThese innovations are part of a wider industry push to make cars lighter.\n\n\"There is a rush to try and cut as much weight as possible, especially on cars which will pollute more, like SUVs [sports utility vehicles] or pick-up trucks,\" says Paolo Martino, principal automotive components analyst at IHS Markit.\n\nSlimmer cars consume less fuel. The US Department of Energy says a 10% reduction in vehicle weight can improve fuel economy by up to 8%.\n\nManufacturers also want to make electric models as light as possible so they can travel further on a single charge, and help resolve the battery \"range anxiety\" faced by car owners, Mr Martino says.\n\nAnd that's where the humble tree could come in. After all, wood has been used to build ships, homes and furniture for millennia.\n\nResearchers at Kyoto University in Japan say a material made from wood pulp could be as strong as steel, but 80% lighter.\n\nThe team chemically treats wood pulp, which consists of millions of cellulose nanofibres (CNFs), and disperses these CNFs into plastic.\n\nBlending CNFs with plastics creates a strong, hybrid material that could replace steel in auto parts, they say.\n\nProf Hiroyuki Yano, who leads the work at Kyoto University, says the material could be used to make door panels, fenders and car bonnets. The researchers are working with the Japanese government, carmakers and other manufacturers to develop the material.\n\nCellulose nanofibres are already used in a range of products, from ink to transparent displays.\n\nWhile the material faces plenty of competition from more commercially established lightweight options, like carbon fibre, Prof Yano believes CNF-based parts could be viable alternatives.\n\nBut Vivek Vaidya, senior vice president at consultancy Frost & Sullivan, has some doubts.\n\nHe thinks it's feasible that \"non-performance\" parts - anything but the engine, transmission and wheels - could be mass-produced from wood pulp-based materials, but that parts manufacturers might struggle to keep pace with auto production lines.\n\n\"Most components are supplied on-demand, [so] whether a wood or organic material can be made available in a just-in-time way is definitely a question mark,\" he says.\n\nSeparately in Japan, researchers are working on specialised plastics for car parts.\n\nProf Tatsuo Kaneko, from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, is developing plastics made with biological molecules.\n\nThe new material is also lighter than steel and can tolerate temperatures of up to 300C, the researchers say.\n\n\"Plastics haven't been used in car parts requiring higher heat resistance around [the] engine block because they haven't been able to withstand the heat,\" Prof Kaneko says.\n\n\"But the bioplastics I have produced can withstand higher temperatures.\"\n\nHe's working with a number of Japanese carmakers, auto part and electronics makers - as well as foreign companies - on the research.\n\nAnd one of the biggest advantages of using the material, which he says could be a viable alternative to steel in around five years, would be a drop in vehicle weight.\n\nWhile lighter plastic car parts might help cut vehicle emissions and increase the range of electric cars, doesn't their manufacture bring other environmental risks?\n\nProf Kaneko acknowledges that substituting materials like glass for bioplastics could increase pollution, as the waste is non-biodegradable.\n\nBut he argues that his materials are kinder overall to the environment than traditional plastics.\n\nThe manufacture of conventional petroleum-based plastics results in large amounts of carbon dioxide, whereas bioplastics, made from micro-organisms, produce lower volumes of waste, he maintains.\n\nThe drive to use \"greener\" materials is gathering speed among automakers more broadly.\n\nFrost & Sullivan's Mr Vaidya says manufacturers are trying to shrink the total carbon footprint of a vehicle and \"not just the emissions that come out of the tailpipe\".\n\nThe push serves tightening regulations and consumer demand. Both the UK and France plan to ban new diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040, to reduce pollution and carbon emissions.\n\nChina, the world's biggest car market, wants electric battery cars and plug-in hybrids to account for at least one-fifth of its vehicle sales by 2025.\n\n\"There's definite movement towards improving the green credentials of the car by using materials that are more environmentally friendly,\" Mr Vaidya says.\n\nTo shed weight BMW has focused on carbon fibre, and last month unveiled a new slimmed down M5 sedan with a carbon fibre reinforced plastic roof.\n\nToyota uses the same material for parts in its Prius Prime and Lexus LC 500 models, cutting weight and boosting battery range in the Prius.\n\nFor Jaguar, aluminium is a big focus. The company says the metal weighs about one third of the equivalent amount of steel.\n\n\"Every 100kg saved with an aluminium chassis helps to reduce the vehicle's CO2 emissions by 9g per km, and fuel usage during its life by up to 800 litres,\" Jaguar says.\n\nAnd niche component makers like Corning, which markets its toughened Gorilla Glass for use in windshields and other glass-components, says its high-tech glass is a third lighter than conventional car windows.", "Peter Hickman will travel over the North Sea to Holland for the penultimate round of the MCE British Superbike championship.\n\nAssen's Cathedral of Speed circuit will be the venue for the latest action on Sunday.\n\nCurrently lying in fifth place in the rider standings, Willoughby rider Hicky needs two top results from the weekend to move him up the order to challenge for the 2017 British Superbike title.\n\nAnd although fifth sounds a way off first place, the points are very close and Hicky only trails leader Leon Haslam by 41 points.\n\nWith 50 points up for grabs at Assen, and a further 50 points on offer at Brands Hatch in the final round, the championship is far from over.\n\nAny one of the six contenders is in with a chance of lifting the trophy.\n\nThe Assen circuit is one of the fastest on the calendar, and nobody can doubt Hickman's speed as he is one of the fastest riders out there, being placed fourth in the 2017 Road Racing rankings.\n\nWith the Smiths Racing BMW under him, he will be seeking two strong results on Sunday, but of course the other five riders in the showdown will be out to take the win in each of the two races for themselves, so it will be a battle royal to the finish line each time.\n\nThe timetable is: Friday - free practice one 10.15am, free practice two 3.15pm; Saturday - free practice three 10am, qualifying 4.15pm; Sunday - warm-up 9.15am, race one 12.15pm, race two 4.30pm.", "Amazon announced an ambitious slate of new Echo devices this week, ranging from a new \"Echo Plus\" to a $20 pack of buttons for playing Alexa-enabled games.\n\nIn fact, the company announced so many devices in one day that it basically doubled the products in the Echo line in one fell swoop.\n\nAll the new gadgets are hard to keep straight, so we give you the rundown in this episode of Geared Up.

The driver-oriented small cars are probably the most relevant to the company's cockpit -- oriented ethos and deliver a driving experience you expect but don't necessarily earn at this price.\n\nThe BMW M140i hws earned a $5000 price cut , transforming the five-door hatch into the bargain buy of BMW's M and M Peformance dange.\n\nThe $59,900 vehicle is $40,000 cheaper than the full blown M2 coupe (a manual-gearbox M2 Pure is $93,900), which helps explain why the vanilla-looking hatch will be the second most popular performance vehicle in the BMW arsenal this year.\n\nThe M240i coupe is likely to be less popular, largely because the premium for the coupe over dthe hatch is $16,600. You have to be besotted with the two-door's looks to drop the extra money when the only major difference beyond the body shape is the coupe's heated seats.\n\nThe M240i is still an enticing deal, given it is more than $20,000 cheaper than the full M vehicle.\n\nBoth variants benefit from a mid-life makeover of the 1 and 2 Series range. In the case of the top-spec versions, the updates include the latest infotainment software shown on an 8.8-inch capacitive touch screen (previous screens haven't been touch-enabled), along with adaptive LED headlamps and upgraded interior trim. BMW is continuing to ask customers to fork out $650 for Apply Car Play, while Android Auto is not available.\n\nRear seat leg space is an issue in both the 1 and 2 Series, limiting the back pews to occasional adult use. They're fine for kids, which is where BMW identifies the target audience, along with empty nesters who appreciate the compact size and expansive performance.\n\nPrices are up an average of $2000 across the two model lines, with the cheapest cars being the three-cylinder engined 118i at $39,900 and the 220i at $52,900. Of course, you can always take the topless approach with the 2 Series convertible, which ranges from $59,900 for the 220i to $85,800 for the M240i.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic is the default transmission irrespective of which vehicle you want but buyers can specify the six-speed manual as a no-cost option. Packages for the cheaper variants are headlined by the \"Driver Assist\" bundle with adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam headlamps, semi-automated parking and anti-glare mirrors. The cost varies by version but tops out at $1800.\n\nON THE ROAD\n\nTwo days traversing some of Tasmania's best bitumen reveals the M2 can't perform much better than the M140i/M240i on public roads, at least not within legal-speed parameters.\n\nUltimately there's a touch more grip and a touch better responsiveness firing out of a corner coutesy of the wider tyres, extra track on the rear wheels and the limited slip diff that's a $5400 option on the M140/M240. You'd still be hard-pressed to justify the extra spend for your daily driver, unless you acknowledge you just want \"the best\" car, replete with the look-at-me massive front air intakes and rear bumper with its four-pipe extrusions.\n\nTo put it into context, the M140/M240 cars hit 100km/h in 4.6 seconds; the M2 does it in 4.3. Potential buyers will make their own decisions about how much 0.3 of a second is worth.\n\nThe speed-sign recognition is a highlight, identifying even temporary road signs affixed to guide posts.\n\nT\n\nhe M140i in particular is a stealth weapon. The only indication that this isn't mum's shopping trolley comes from the blue brake callipers and discreet M badges on the flanks and rear. Find a flowing country road and this hatch changes direction like a matador and charges like a bull. Steering feel is about as good as it gets in a BMW these days and the chassis gives ample warning when you are approaching the limits.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe updates are minor but the price cut for the BMW M140i is a major deal. For most of the people, most of the time, the performance hatch is going to be the smartest investment, if not the best-looking.\n\nThe most potent 1 Series has had $5000 trimmed off its price despite the inclusion of adaptive LEDs; the M240i has climbed by $1600 due to the fitment of the LEDs and heated seats.\n\ndTECHNOLOGY\n\nInterior Infotainment software has been updated and there's an 8.8-inch touchscreen. Apple CarPlay is still an option and Android Auto is not available\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe instrument display has been upgraded with a black background to improve contrast, while new trim materials and finishes can be had on both vehicles.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nAdaptive LED headlamps is the big-ticket item on the outside of the cars. The 2 Series gains new front and rear bumpers; the 1 Series picks up new alloy wheels and an expanded paint palette, though 10 of the 12 colours cost extra.", "10 examples of collaboration between Monocle magazine and brands in their July/August 09 issue.

Halfway through a model's life-cycle, car companies often will give it some new touches to keep it fresh as newer competitors come out. Maybe some new headlights and taillights, possibly some new tech and maybe even an engine or two. Most of the time, it's just to keep the car relevant and to maintain customer intrigue. However, sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes, it's to bring life into a car. Unfortunately, that time is now for the BMW 7 Series.\n\nThe new G11 7er is a good car. It's high-tech, spacious, incredibly luxurious and has good performance, overall. Though, it does have one big problem and it wears a three-pointed star. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a dynamite machine, a car that customers can't seem to stop buying. To be fair, it's the better of the two cars. As a luxury sedan, the S-Class is unrivaled in its class. It's stylish, wonderfully opulent, packed with technology and effortlessly luxurious. While the 7 Series is great in its own way, it just isn't as popular as the S-Class. So BMW needs to breathe some life back into its flagship luxury car.\n\nTo do so, the Bavarian brand is already working on the car's mid-cycle refresh, or LCI in BMW-speak. This will be an important LCI for BMW and its 7 Series. While the 7er is great under its skin, neither its exterior or interior design really garner praise from customers in the segment. Sure, the build quality is superb, the materials are fantastic and the luxury tech is from the future. However, it just doesn't look as exciting or as luxurious as the S-Class, which just received its own refresh and looks better than ever.\n\nThis newly refreshed 7 Series was recently caught doing some pre-production testing, wearing heavy camouflage around its updated areas (we don't own the spy photos but they can be seen here). It's said to be getting new headlights, taillights and even Kidney Grilles. Those are really the largest areas of complaint for customers in this segment. That and the weird hockey-stick trim on the side. The newly refreshed 7er is also said to be getting some new interior features and also some new self-driving tech. The latter is likely to combat the upcoming Audi A8, which is the first production car in history to be capable of Level 3 Autonomy.\n\nThe BMW 7 Series has more great competition than ever, especially from Mercedes-Benz and soon-to-be Audi. So BMW really needs to step it up with this refresh if it wants to start pulling sales back from its German rival. This is a good way to start.

Journet II, 38, had waived his right to a jury trial and had been scheduled for a bench trial at the Capital Judicial Center Thursday.\n\nHowever, the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Tyler LeClair, and defense attorney Leonard Sharon reached an agreement regarding the conditional plea of guilty.\n\nJudge Valerie Stanfill accepted the plea on that basis and set a sentencing hearing for Nov. 1.\n\nThe attorneys told her the agreement -- which was also in writing -- called for them to argue over the sentence, which would be capped at 10 years overall, with a maximum of five years to serve initially and the remainder suspended while the defendant serves a maximum of four years' probation.\n\nSharon noted that the offense carries a minimum prison term of four years. Journet has a 2008 conviction for unlawful trafficking in drugs.\n\nLeClair outlined for the judge the evidence the state would provide at trial, saying Journet's blue BMW sport utility vehicle was stopped Dec. 16, 2015, on Winthrop Court in Augusta, indicating that it was directly behind the courthouse.\n\nHe said a confidential informant had told police that a drug dealer driving that type of vehicle would be bringing heroin to sell.\n\nLeClair also said that Journet's passenger, Danielle Bunikis, now 25, of Brunswick began \"screaming and pulling out her pony-tail,\" yelling that she had made a mistake and \"her life was over.\"\n\nAt the jail, she pulled a package from her underwear that contained a packet of heroin.\n\nBunikis later pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful furnishing of drugs and was placed on deferred disposition.

That has the car industry worried.\n\nThe auto industry is much closer to the government in Germany than in most other countries. For one thing, the state government of Lower Saxony is the second largest shareholder in Volkswagen, the world's largest carmaker last year, and sits on the company's board of directors. Even in other states, car companies have a lot of clout because of their major contributions to the booming German economy.\n\nBut the auto industry fears that may be changing as a result of the elections held last Sunday, which are likely to bring about a reshuffle in cabinet seats and perhaps environmental policy as well. The current consensus is that Chancellor Angela Merkel will likely form a three-way coalition with the business-friendly Free Democratic Party and the pro-environment Greens.\n\nIt is the presence of the Greens in the cabinet that worries the automakers the most. The party has demanded an end to production of cars with combustion engines as early as 2030. \"For the government to express a preference for a type of engine is nonsense,\" said an industry spokesman, who asked not to be identified. \"It's by selling combustion engines that we will earn the funds to pay for the industry's conversion to electric cars.\"\n\nThe Greens have demanded an end to production of cars with combustion engines as early as 2030.\n\nMs. Merkel reassured automakers during an appearance at the Frankfurt International Auto Show this month that her government would not set any deadlines for the end of combustion engines, as Britain did by announcing a 2040 cutoff. But she also urged them to move faster on the conversion to non-polluting electric cars.\n\nOne of the staunchest supporters of combustion engines in the ruling coalition has been the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, home to both BMW and Audi. But the party fared poorly in the election and is likely to lose some cabinet seats and influence over policy.\n\nAnother major concern for the industry is how the government handles the ballooning scandal about diesel emissions. Volkswagen has admitted that its diesel emissions control system was fitted with an illegal defeat device so that diesel cars would pass emissions tests but produce much more nitrogen oxide fumes once on the road. Other carmarkers have not admitted to such trickery, but they have agreed to recall diesel cars to retrofit them with better emission control software.\n\nSo far the government has had a relatively mild response to the diesel issue, compared with the United States, which fined VW $16 billion and and sent at least one VW official to prison. But that soft approach may now change with the departure of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrint, who is part of the CSU leadership. In addition, Barbara Hendricks, the country's environment minister, is in the Social Democratic Party, which is leaving the government coalition.\n\nThe government has scheduled a second \"diesel summit\" with carmakers to discuss what can done done about diesel pollution. One solution that was suggested and quickly rejected was to give diesel cars blue license plates and then ban those cars from city centers on days when pollution exceeds legal limits. That suggestion may now be revived.\n\nThere have been reports that Merkel's government has offered the blue license plate, which is tantamount to a diesel driving ban, to the Greens as a sop in return for Green support of the government's plans to toughen up immigration rules. Ms. Merkel has been talking tough on immigration since the election allowed an anti-immigration party to win seats in the parliament.\n\nA Green transport minister also may be less likely to give the carmakers an easy ride on the diesel issue, especially since prosecutors in Munich confirmed Thursday that they have arrested a second Audi executive in the emissions cheating case after searching Audi officials' homes.\n\nVoters are already up in arms because the resale value of diesel cars has plummeted as the emission scandal has mushroomed. The Greens may decide that a get-tough policy on diesel is what the country needs, even if it is opposed by the industry itself.", "In case you haven't been living under a rock special enough to block wi-fi connections, you know that the 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS has become the new King of the Nurburgring - since Zuffenhausen nicknamed the car King Kong we suspect the car was built for this purpose. 3 photosAnd while Porsche was keeping us on our toes by delaying the announcement on the said chronograph accolade, the carmaker introduced the world to the 2018 911 GT3 Touring Package.\n\nCompared to the GT2 RS, this can be considered at the opposite end of the GT Division ferocity, as we're talking about a pack destined for boosting the daily driver aura of the Gen 2 GT3.\n\nBut what is somebody was to mix the two in the search for a... 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS?\n\nNo, we're not on the wrong pills here. Instead, we've comes across such a proposal on social media, as you can notice in the Instagram posts at the bottom of the page.\n\nOf course, such a move wouldn't make too much sense in real life and there are at least two reasons for this. For starters, the GT2 RS, which mixes 700 hp with rear-wheel-drive, needs all the downforce it can get, so skipping the wing doesn't sound all the desirable.\n\nThen there's the idea of using a machine animated by 700 ponies for going to the supermarket or to the movies.\n\nThen again, we could also find an argument in favor of such a Neunelfer derivative. For one thing, Porsche has taught us that there's always room for more in the overly rich 911 lineup.\n\nAnd we're pretty sure that there would be certain Zuffenhausen lovers who could find the logic behind a Porsche 911 GT2 RS Touring Package. And the same goes for aftermarket developers, not that taking the wing off a supercar would require specially trained engineering.\n\ntouring gt2?! .#photoshopped #porsche911 #991 #porsche911gt2rs #porsche #911 #gt2rs #gt2touring #widebody #cardreams #carporn #outlaw\n\nA post shared by Photoshopped To See Dreams (@ptsdreams) on Sep 28, 2017 at 5:43am PDT\n\ntouring gt2?! .#photoshopped #porsche911 #991 #porsche911gt2rs #porsche #911 #gt2rs #gt2touring #widebody #cardreams #carporn #outlaw\n\nA post shared by Photoshopped To See Dreams (@ptsdreams) on Sep 28, 2017 at 5:43am PDT\n\n2018 porsche 911 gt2 rs Porsche 911 Porsche 911 GT2 RS rendering 2018 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring Package German Combustion Engines Have Six Years To Walk The Plank The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Age of Enlightenment With a Mazda MX-5 RF on The Transfagarasan Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 Could Volkswagen Group's Electric Plans Include Ducati?

The Model 3's combination of sleek styling, long range and semiautonomous driving features gives the Model 3 an \"it\" factor that's hard to resist. But with a base price of $35,000, limited availability, and many of its most desirable features on the options list, the Model 3 isn't for everybody.\n\nFor buyers who are interested in an electric vehicle but don't want to wait around for the Model 3, several great alternatives are available now at a similar price point. Some have shorter ranges while others lack the latest driver-assistance features, but if you're interested in an electric car that won't take as long to arrive, these EVs are worth a look.\n\n2018 NISSAN LEAF\n\nThe Nissan Leaf was a game-changer when it debuted in 2011, so hopes are high for the redesigned 2018 model. The Leaf still doesn't have the long-range abilities of the Model 3 and Chevrolet Bolt, but its low base price gives it a level of attainability that most competitors can't match. In addition to its new look, the 2018 Leaf boasts a larger battery pack that increases maximum range from 107 miles to an estimated 150 miles. A more powerful electric motor bumps output from 107 to 147 horsepower for improved performance.\n\nTwo new features set the Leaf apart from its rivals. The first is called e-Pedal. It allows drivers to bring the Leaf to a complete stop merely by lifting off the accelerator. It makes for a one-pedal driving experience that eases fatigue in heavy traffic.\n\nThe second feature, called ProPilot Assist, combines several driver aids to provide a semiautonomous driving experience. Available on SV and SL models, ProPilot Assist maintains a set distance between the Leaf and the car in front, keeps the Leaf centered in its lane and steers through corners. Nissan notes that it's called ProPilot \"assist,\" so drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV is the Model 3's closest rival. Not only can it travel 238 miles on a single charge -- besting the standard Model 3's estimated range by 18 miles -- it's also one of the quickest EVs on this list, needing just 6.8 seconds to hit 60 mph from a dead stop. It's priced similarly to the Model 3, but the Bolt EV has a solid list of features for that price and is widely available at Chevrolet dealers nationwide.\n\nLike the Leaf, the Hyundai Ioniq EV offers solid range at a low starting price. It also has upscale cabin materials, which feel more substantial and durable than what others in the class use. The restrained interior also has a practical design, a bonus for buyers who want an EV that still feels like a conventional car.\n\nThe Volkswagen e-Golf takes the Golf's impressive handling and solid construction and adds an EV powertrain. Numerous improvements for the 2017 model year include an updated battery pack with increased range, a more powerful motor, a higher top speed, exterior styling changes and the addition of a midpack Limited Edition trim.\n\nBMW's i3 stands out in more ways than one. Its funky styling hides a frame made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, making it extremely tough yet lightweight. Inside, its cabin is decked out with natural materials, including real eucalyptus wood trim and leather treated with olive tree leaf extract. The i3 is sold with a choice of two battery sizes: the base 60-amp-hour version with 81 miles of range or the 94-Ah version with 114 miles of range. The 94-Ah model is also available with a small gasoline engine to further extend the i3's range when the battery runs out.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: You don't have to wait for a Tesla Model 3 to get an affordable EV with more than enough range to handle your everyday commute.", "Sen.

The i3S is a slightly ...\n\nBMW tried to answer some of the calls for a sportier i3 variant, recently, when it debuted the BMW i3S. The i3S is a slightly sportier, slightly faster variant of the newly refreshed BMW i3. It gets a few more ponies, stiffer suspension and a wider wheeltrack. So it should be a bit more fun to drive. However, it wasn't quite enough for a lot of fans. BMW enthusiasts still see a lot of untapped potential in the i3's chassis and capabilities. Fans are still wondering if something like a BMW i3 M would ever be a possibility. Top Speed recently entertained the idea with this new render.\n\nNow, we've heard for a long time that BMW's i Division and M Division will remain separate and will not be working together directly on a new model. Some expertise might be shared in the future, such as BMW M borrowing some i Division tech on a hybrid M car, but BMW claims the two divisions will not work jointly on a car. So an i3 M likely won't happen. However, it's fun to speculate and see what such a car could be like.\n\nIn this render, the BMW i3 M gets lowered, subtle fender flares, larger wheels, large front air intakes and M mirrors, among other things. Is it weird that I kind of like it? The front end looks aggressive, with the massive intakes.The aerodynamic side mirrors from other M cars also work well with the i3's funky styling. Also, the BMW i3 has always had large wheels, to accommodate the oddly tall and thin tire, so the big wheels here look good.\n\nYou might think that the front air intakes are useless, considering that the i3 is electric. However, in Top Speed's render, they're speculating that it received a hybrid powertrain from the BMW i8. A detuned variant of that powertrain could give a potential BMW i3 M somewhere around 220 - 230 hp, much like the MINI Countryman plug-in hybrid. That would be anywhere between 36 and 46 hp more than the i3s. That would go a long way to making the i3 a lot more fun.\n\nThe idea of an aggressive BMW i3 M is kind of hilarious and we do wish it was made. Imagine a fast and fun electric hot hatch with the oddball looks of the BMW i3? That would be a hilariously good time to drive. The standard BMW i3 is fun to drive, with its sharp handling and funny electric car whine. Imagine one with, say, 230 hp?", "Let's face it. Most American car buyers in 2017 don't actually want cars. You know, the traditional passenger car. Most car buyers who actually want cars don't want full-size sedans built by mainstream sedans. And among the few car buyers who actually want full-size volume brand sedans, the overwhelming majority \u00e2\u0080\" 99 percent, in fact \u00e2\u0080\" do not want a Kia Cadenza.\n\nThe U.S. market is about to get a lot more difficult for the Kia Cadenza, which is currently priced from $32,890. Admittedly more powerful than the forthcoming 2018 Kia Stinger, the Kia Cadenza is a nearly five-year-old front-wheel-drive luxury barge in a semi-attractive Kia body.\n\nThe 2018 Kia Stinger, on the other hand, is a flashy new cut-price sports hatch, a model deserving of some anticipation that's priced\u00c2 from $32,795, or ninety-five dollars less costly than the chronically unpopular Kia Cadenza.\n\nOf course, comparing the Kia Stinger and its twin-turbocharged V6-engined Stinger GT sibling with the Cadenza is not what Kia wants consumers to do. The 2018 Kia Stinger will cost thousands less than supposed competitors such as the Audi A5 Sportback and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. By the time the Stinger reaches the\u00c2 $40K tipping point \u00e2\u0080\" or $39,895 to be precise \u00e2\u0080\" it's already equipped with a 365-horsepower twin turbo 3.3-liter V6. The A5 Sportback\u00c2 starts at $43,575; the 430i Gran Coupe at $44,095.\n\nImagining legions of German-intended luxury car buyers making a switch to the Kia requires an enormous leap, but that explains Kia's significant price advantage. It remains to be seen how much of that advantage is wiped away by more rapidly degrading resale values. Fortunately, Kia's not entering the market with a half-hearted effort.On the basic $32,795 Stinger, Car And Driver reports, standard equipment includes leather seating, a seven-inch infotainment unit with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, dual-zone automatic climate control, and the eight-speed automatic transmission that's married to each of the Stinger's engines across the board. A Stinger Premium trim pushes the price up to $37,895, Jalopnik says, by adding a sunroof, LED lighting, a special gauge cluster, and a larger touchscreen with navigation. All-wheel drive is a $2,200 option on these and other Stinger GT models.\n\nThe Stinger GT is offered in three different forms: GT, GT1, and the aptly named GT2 variant. All GT models receive the hood vents that appear to be trying too hard to convince us, Pontiac-like, of performance. To the basic $39,895 GT, which is equipped like the basic non-GT Stinger, the $44,395 GT1 adds the Stinger Premium's content.The top-spec Stinger GT2, $50,395 with rear-wheel drive or $52,595 with all-wheel drive, includes\u00c2 standard safety kit like automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise, lane keeping assist, and auto high beams (available elsewhere in the range) plus a limited-slip differential, a power trunk, and head-up display.\n\nKia's pricing isn't yet set firmly in stone for the 2018 Stinger, but don't expect any meaningful changes. The fact that the Stinger undercuts the Cadenza does it no favors \u00e2\u0080\" this latest Kia must fight the same battle that the Kia K900 and Cadenza have so far failed to win. \"But it's a Kia,\" will be the common refrain, no matter how pleasant it is to look at, no matter how great it is to drive. For goodness' sake, that's essentially what the boss of Kia's Genesis corporate partner already said.\n\nSecuring the sales of each and every sports sedan buyer that manages to see past the badge is vital, and by pricing the Stinger appropriately, Kia stands a chance.", "Amazon just announced a new Echo smart speaker that delivers better sound in a smaller package and comes with new Alexa Routines to streamline voice controls. This is what you need to know about the Echo 2, which Amazon is simply calling the Echo.\n\nIn addition to the new more affordable Echo, Amazon announced a Fire TV with 4K & HDR, the Echo Plus, Alexa in BMW cars and new Echo buttons as well as a box that lets your Echo call any phone, not just other Echo devices.\n\nThe new Amazon Echo is a smart speaker that you can use as a personal assistant to play music, check information, control your smart home and more.

This works on all of the options. You cannot mix in the Echo PLus or Echo Spot with this deal.\n\nThe 2017 Echo is cheaper than the model it replaces, which makes it more affordable to put Alexa everywhere in your house.

The new devices represent the Seattle company's push into building its own hardware three years after the surprise release of the original Amazon Echo. The cylindrical tower, controlled by Amazon's Alexa voice-activated software, was a surprise hit, spawning a range of lookalikes built by rivals such as Google and Apple.\n\nDebuted first was the new Echo, shorter than its predecessor and bearing a refined speaker and microphone. The company also shrank the price: The new Echo will sell for $100 in the U.S. (The original sold for $200 at launch).\n\nDave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said voice-activated computing \"is going to be ubiquitous.\" Future generations, he said, will be unfamiliar with a world in which people can't tap into computers by using their voice. While Alexa's core uses are simple tasks like playing music, checking the weather and setting alarms, the device is also in the center of the race to build a hub that controls internet-enabled devices of all sorts. Alexa's off-the-shelf tools made available to software developers means builders of everything from lightbulbs to stoves can link the operation of their devices to the software's voice commands.\n\nA new version of the Echo takes aim at that universe. The Echo Plus, which looks largely the same as the original Echo, is pitched at simplifying the sometimes-tedious task of connecting Alexa with other devices. Users can say \"Alexa, discover my devices,\" and the Echo Plus will find and link with the devices it is able to find on the network. More than 100 devices will be compatible with that functionality at launch, Amazon says.\n\nIt's not just appliance and electronics makers plugging into Alexa. BMW says it will incorporate Alexa into its cars beginning next year, letting drivers use voice commands to toggle the radio, get directions, or check the news and weather. Two new, smaller devices are also coming. The Echo Connect, when plugged into a telephone jack, allows people to make and receive calls from a landline phone number using Alexa.\n\nAnd Echo Buttons are hockey-puck-sized neon devices that can be paired with an Echo as a tactile outlet for games or other applications. Amazon also introduced the Echo Spot, which, like the Echo Show, gives Alexa a screen to display photos, videos and a range of visual cues. The Spot looks a bit like an alarm clock, sporting a two-and-a-half inch screen. It will cost $130, and will be available in the U.S. in December, Amazon says.\n\nBoth the new Echo and Echo Plus will start shipping to consumers in October.", "Even since it launched last year, the BMW M2, with its curvaceous lines and appealing physique, has attracted a huge following and it is now ...\n\nEven since it launched last year, the BMW M2, with its curvaceous lines and appealing physique, has attracted a huge following and it is now one of the most popular M cars ever made. Its older, more powerful siblings are better in some high-performance specs, but the smaller, nimbler M2 can certainly keep up with its brethren. The vehicle comes powered by a by a 3.0 Liter BMW TwinPower Turbo engine delivering 370 horsepower and 369lb-ft of torque. It allows the nimble high-performance coupe to sprint from 0-62mph (0-100km/h) in just 4.1 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to 155mph (250km/h).\n\nAdd a striking exterior finish - like this Long Beach Blue - and the BMW M2 is transformed into a looker by all means. While this may be enough for some M2 owners, others are looking for that extra oomph to make their sports car stand out. Hence, the owner of this M2 opted in for a set of aftermarket wheels and a slight drop, to make the BMW M2 follow his vision what a car should look like to the last letter.\n\nThis M2 features a set of Vossen Precision Series VPS-314T forged wheels. These lightweight wheels are custom made for the each build they are headed for, making them fit perfectly and adhere to all the requirements of a particular vehicle build. For this BMW M2, the wheels are machined in sizes of 20\u00d79.5 in the front and 20\u00d710. in the rear, respectively. However, the most striking thing about this wheel setup is its finish. The wheels are adorned with a finish Vossen calls \"Imperial Gold\" - a classy looking choice, to say the least.\n\nAdditional cosmetic touches on this M2 consist of a front diffuser and decklid spoiler, alongside Gloss Black kidney grilles. These parts clean up the exterior nicely, giving it a more refined look.

Both doctors had impressive car collections, and now, after being stored for two years, those cars are up for auction.\n\nMost of the cars are the usual rich-guy fare: some Bentleys, an Audi R8, three Porsche 911s, but there's some more interesting stuff around, too.\n\nCouch had this nice 1969 Corvette Stingray. This was only the second year of the new C3 body style, and it looks like it's in fantastic shape. Maybe there's some pills under the floormats, too.\n\nRuan's oldest car is this lovely 1987 BMW M6 coupe; if you've been looking for a shark-nose BMW, but were holding out for one that had a former owner with that rare combination of a post-grad degree and a felony conviction, I think we've found your car.\n\nRuan also had some other unusual stuff, like this 2009 Spyker C8 Laviolette -- it has only 10 miles on the clock! With such low mileage, this is a great choice if you're looking to replace your commuter Camry with something a bit more fun.\n\nIf the Spyker's too practical for you, check this out:\n\nA 2006 Saleen S7.

We don't need marble countertops or handcrafted wood dining tables, or a working sink. But the one luxury we do love is a nice garage. Will finally bought himself a house with a garage and now he needs a weekend toy to call it home. What car should he buy?\n\n(Welcome back to What Car Should You Buy? Where we give real people real advice about buying cars. Do you want us to help you find a car? Submit your story on our form.)\n\nHere is the scenario:\n\nI'm 28 years old with a good job and a reliable daily driver. I finally have a garage for the first time in my life and want to use the money I've been saving over the past couple years to fill it with a fun weekend toy.\n\nMy budget tops out at $35,000 and I have a few requirements. First, a manual transmission is a must -- this is a fun car so no automatics. Second, I only really want a rear wheel drive or an all-wheel-drive car. And lastly, I'm a big guy at 6'6\" so I need to be comfortable in it. I tend to lean towards the older German stuff, but I'm trying to be open-minded.\n\nWill, I am fully aware of the satisfaction that comes with owning a garage. After living without one for years I too shall soon finally have a place to store my cars out of the elements. It's a nice feeling, and good for you for taking this opportunity not to stash some commuter car in there, but something special.\n\nWhen you open those bay doors you want it to be an event. You should get something that the neighbors catch quick glances of and ask \"Hey, what's he got in there?\" You need something with a combination of vintage style, speed, and class. That's right, I'm talking about a classic BMW 850i.\n\nHere is a gorgeous Mauritian Blue 1992 850i with a V12 and a six-speed manual for sale up in Canada from our friends at Bring a Trailer. This big BMW, and it should be plenty comfortable for your larger frame. And did I mention it has a V12?\n\nCurrent bid is only $5,000 and while that is sure to climb as the auction starts to close, but hopefully, it will leave you enough of a savings buffer for maintenance.\n\nA garage! My house has two driveways and no garage, and not a moist, rainy day goes by that I don't wish I had a garage. You have to really make the most of it, and there's no better way than to plug that car-hole with this stunning 1974 Lotus Europa.\n\nI mean, if you want something fun, why bother getting something that even has a chance of getting mistaken for something boring-ass and normal while you drive? You want something that even people who don't know mule-stool about cars can see and think, damn, what the hell is that?\n\nThis bright-red, silver-striped, mid-engined Lotus will take care of that, no problem.\n\nThe Europa was one of the first real production mid-engined sportscars you could buy, and it's got a distinctive shape that makes this very clear, with its dramatically wedged nose and boxy butt.\n\nBecause that Ford-sourced Lotus-Ford twin-cam engine is behind you, and you're basically reclining while driving, there's plenty of room inside for those long tree trunks of yours that you call legs. Of course it's a manual, and of course it's real wheel drive, and of course it's going to be a party every time you drive it, even if you're on the way to your urologist.\n\nThis red beast is visceral, lithe, fun, and stands out, in the best way possible. Use that garage to its fullest, and give it a job sheltering something really special, like this fantastic Lotus.\n\nIt's perfect. You know I'm right.\n\nA garage! I used to have a garage. What a marvel it was. I would spend hours in the Texas autumn evenings, coated in mosquito spray, blasting synthwave into my earholes as I carefully wrenched under the hood of my E30. It was magical. Then I moved to New York City, because I hate myself and make bad personal choices. I miss my garage.\n\nBut you, Will -- you can succeed where I failed. You have a garage and a healthy budget. And with those things, and a proclivity for old German metal, there is nothing you cannot accomplish. I will say I disagree with my pal Tom up there and suggest you get a BMW M6 instead, but let's not make this a Bimmer lovefest. Their fans are insufferable enough.\n\nInstead, turn your eyes and your heart to the king of the transaxle Porsches, the 928. It's big, it's opulent, it's got a mighty V8 under the hood, and it will make you look like a cocaine-taking 1980s rich person. I can think of few cars that encapsulate '80s ludicrous excess than that. Here is an example in Chicago with 66,000 miles for just under $19,000. It has the manual you desire, and space for your tall frame.\n\nAnd that garage? You'll be using it, friend-o! Because the 928 is a pain in the ass to maintain properly. Maybe the biggest pain in the ass. But you're a big man who takes on big challenges, Will! Aim for the stars here.\n\nI'm going to recommend a car that I've been drooling over since I was in college: the first-generation Audi S5 Coupe. No, I'm not just suggesting it because I want one; this thing makes total sense for a 28 year-old like yourself.\n\nNot only does it have looks that could kill, but it's large enough for a tall guy like you, and it's got a 4.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 that makes over 350 horsepower, and gets the car to 60 mph in about five seconds flat. And of course, all that power can be sent through a six-speed manual.\n\nYou're young! Your reflexes are at an all-time high. Don't waste that driving all those slow cars mentioned above. Even the dang V-12 8-Series Tom mentioned doesn't even make 300 horsepower. You need more, and that's what the S5's big V8 offers.\n\nHere's a random one I plucked off of Craigslist going. It comes with snow tires, and a big list of mods including a custom exhaust for ten grand under your budget. Normally I'd be rather hesitant to recommend a used Audi (they're not known for their reliability), but I've read good things about the 4.2-liter V8. So I say: go for it.", "Just because you don't own a car in Seattle doesn't mean it's any easier to park one that you borrow.

It's probably about a year old but spent a lot of that gathering dust as a wreck. The Russian mechanics saw potential where their American counterparts didn't, so the hybrid was imported and repaired. 3 photosAt first glance, the car has only minor damage. However, once the bumper, hood, and fenders are removed, the true extent of the shunt is revealed.\n\nFirst, the body shop specialist removes the side skirt to get access to the jacking points. This allows him to take the wheel off and remove the dinged up plastic arch. The fender then comes off, followed by the hood.\n\nThe chassis is a little bent, so Arthur (that's his name) whips out his magic laser and starts measuring. He uses a chain winch to pull the damaged left chassis rail back towards the left one. Just like a basic cardboard box, you know it's perfect when the sides are straight, and the two diagonals are equal.\n\nNew radiator and headlight supports are installed. After that, a replacement hood is test-fitted. One of the fenders only suffered a minor ding, and we get to see the master fix it in what seems like only a few minutes. Of course, we know it takes years of practice to get it right.\n\nThis just goes to show that even though a car looks broken, it can usually be fixed. However, if your mechanic is asking $100 per hour and $5,000 for the parts, you might want to consider shipping it to the Russians.\n\nThe Prius has been around for over 20 years and is practically synonymous with hybrids.

The $34.99 Echo Connect and $129.99 Echo Spot are expected to arrive on the market in December; the Echo Buttons, to be priced at two for $19.99, are awaiting approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, although Amazon said the devices will \"arrive in time for the holidays.\"\n\nDueling AIs\n\nAs the world's largest online retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon operates in a different space from other tech giants. However, its latest devices could bring heightened competitive worries to Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others, in part because of Amazon's large reach and typically lower-cost pricing.\n\nGuided by CEO Sundar Pichai's mission to make artificial intelligence \"work for everyone,\" Google, for instance, is working to broaden use of its intelligent agent Google Assistant -- its analog to Amazon's Alexa -- through its own smart-home speaker, Google Home. And the new 4K Amazon Fire TV poses a direct threat to Apple's new digital media player, Apple TV 4K, which was announced earlier this month and arrived in stores last Friday.\n\nWriting today in ZDNet, Steve Ranger called Amazon's latest Echo announcements a \"land grab\" for leadership in the smart-home device space.\n\n\"Amazon sells its hardware cheap because making money that way is not (at least for now) its priority,\" he said. \"This is a land-grab; whichever company reaches enough homes fast enough will become the effective standard.\"\n\nThe wider Amazon Alexa's reach into people's devices and homes becomes, the greater the threat it also poses to other intelligent assistants such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby.\n\nEnterprise Deals with BMW, Randstad\n\nAmazon yesterday also announced two big wins on the enterprise side of its business: a new deal with BMW to integrate Alexa into its vehicles, and a plan by staffing and recruitment company Randstad to move its IT infrastructure onto Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nUnder the BMW partnership, the Germany-based automaker expects to start making Amazon Alexa available in its BMW and Mini vehicles started in mid-2018. Alexa's assistance will be available via voice commands and will also be integrated with in-car visual control displays. The integration will let drivers ask for directions, launch phone calls, listen to music or news, check weather forecasts, and remotely control smart devices in their homes.\n\nThe Randstad deal, meanwhile, will see the company move its entire global IT infrastructure to AWS over the coming year. Randstad said the migration is aimed at improving efficiencies and costs and aligning its infrastructure with its digital transformation and innovation goals.", "Amazon revealed a bunch of revamped tech at their press event today, although most of the tech will be for Echo hardware. The speaker, which was released in 2014, has been in need of an update, especially since they added a camera and a touchscreen to the device not too long ago. The Echo Look (a device with a camera installed in it) was more so that a user could compare their clothes to those on Amazon and work from there to build a fashionable wardrobe. A good idea, but the Echo Look wasn't as popular with people as Amazon may have hoped. So the announcements from today's press event are important in regards to the company's future in the tech world. Take a look at them below.\n\nAs a part of the Echo update, Amazon will release the Echo Plus. This new device will essentially replace the original, yet will maintain the same size as the old one while adding some new features for users to get excited about. The Plus will act as a smart hub for your home, fully equipped with advanced voice recognition and enhanced sound hardware. At a starting price tag of $149, Amazon plans on making this Echo a must have for anyone with a smart home device (like Amazon's Alexa). Note that it won't be compatible with all smart home devices, but over 100 different ones will be able to sync up with the Echo Plus. The device is available for pre-order now and comes out on October 31.\n\nThere are also a series of new, smaller Echoes on sale for pre-order for about $99. At about half the size of the original Echo (and Plus), consumers have the opportunity to buy them in bulk so that they can have audio in multiple rooms. Buyers can purchase these devices in packs of three for $249, with the choice of cloth, wood, and other finishes to match the setting they'll be placed in. The second generation Echo will be released on October 31 as well.\n\nAlong with the second generation Echoes being released, Amazon also plans on having a trivia-style Echo to come out as well. The hockey-puck shaped buttons (Echo Buttons) will be able to be used alongside an Alexa device to play trivia games. This idea is a step forward-technologically speaking-in regards to family entertainment that can be enjoyed in the comfort of one's home.\n\nThe Echo Buttons will be the first in a new line of devices referred to as \"Alexa Gadgets\" by Amazon. The buttons will sell in two-packs for $20. No release date has been specified yet, but it's speculated that they'll be coming at some point during the holiday season.\n\nThe Echo Spot may be the most unique announcement that happened during the Amazon press event. The device is a smart alarm clock that has the ability to make video calls and be connected to external speakers via Bluetooth or a cable. It's pretty much made for those who can't hear their alarms when they wake up (aka me). Enter a loudspeaker; exit no more being late for work. It'll come equipped with a 2.5-inch screen and is a hybrid of the Echo Dot and Echo Show. Like the Show and the Dot, the Spot will have built-in speakers and the ability to stream from Pandora, Spotify, and other music streaming services. The Echo Spot will be on sale in December for $130.\n\nYep, you read that right: Alexa and BMW are going to be officially a\"thing.\" Alexa will be integrated into BMW and select Mini vehicles in the beginning of 2018. In line with this \"marriage,\" far-field microphones will be embedded inside the car while projecting Alexa content on the head-unit.\n\nPreviously, Amazon and BMW teamed up to bring an Alexa Skill to their vehicles, as Amazon's website describes in regards to Alexa: \"BMW Connected is literally coming home. Manage your schedule by asking when you should leave for your next trip. Start your journey in comfort by switching on the climate control in advance. And keep your BMW secure by locking the doors without lifting a finger.\" It'll be the first time the two companies have worked together to bring the voice assistant actually inside the car.\n\nThere has been 4K support for the Amazon Fire TV for a good amount of time now, but, announced at the press event, a new device will be released that'll support a 4K HDR video with 2160p resolution at 60 frames per second. That's a pretty impressive step forward in regards to the quality of the device's video capabilities.\n\nThe great thing about the updated Fire TV is the fact that it will only be $69.99. They must have known to price it as it is, because, just a few days earlier, Apple launched its own 4K Apple TV with a price tag of $179. It's not like the difference is $10... There's a disparity of $110. I'm sure the heads of the project at Apple are bumping heads to come up with something to differentiate their product from Amazon's. As it is now, there isn't much of a difference between the two products in regards to quality and capabilities.\n\nWith the new Fire TV, there'll be HDR10 but not Dolby Vision support for HDR playback. On the audio side of things, the device will use Dolby Atmos Integration. On the other hand, the new Apple TV will use both HDR10 and Dolby Vision but not Dolby Atmos Integration. So both devices will have their limitations, but one is way more expensive than the other. I think I know which one will sell more.", "Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) updated line of Alexa powered products, which it unveiled Wednesday, should bode well for the company's growth prospects, prompting JMP Securities to give it a $1,125 price target, implying shares have lots more room to run.\n\nAt $1,125, JMP thinks shares can increase around 18%. Recently Amazon was up 0.52% or $4.92 to $955.79. For the year the stock is more than 25% higher.\n\nIn a research report covered by TheStreet.com, the Wall Street firm said that in addition to announcing updates to its Alexa products, it is lowering the prices on some of the devices, which should expand the e-commerce giant's presence in the connected home and enable it to create a platform that can be found everywhere for consumers. Alexa is Amazon's voice-activated digital assistant that is embedded in its Echo line of smart speakers and is finding its way into a host of other devices and use cases. Just this week, for example, Amazon and BMW announced Alexa will be part of BMW's in-car infotainment and navigation system in select models starting next year. (See also: Amazon Adds Alexa to Music App in Swipe at Rivals.)\n\nDuring an event at the company's headquarters in Seattle, Amazon announced the next generation Echo which will sell for a reduced price of $99.99 and has improved sound quality. It also unveiled the Echo Plus, which is priced at $149.99 and has a built-in smart home hub to connect compatible smart devices in the home simply by telling Alexa to \"discover my devices.\" The company is positioning the smart speakers to be hot items during the holiday selling season. \"Three years ago we introduced the first Echo, powered by Alexa, with a goal to fundamentally simplify and improve the way customers interact with their homes,\" Tom Taylor, senior vice president, Amazon Alexa, said in a press release announcing the devices. \"Today, Alexa can make calls, play music in every room, turn on your lights, and even order you a pizza. But it's still day one, and today we're making Echo and Alexa even better. The all-new Echo and Echo Plus deliver better sound, all new far-field technology, and new features we think customers will love.\"\n\nThe move on the part of Amazon comes as a battle is heating up for smart speaker dominance. While it has emerged as an early leader, Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) Google, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Alibaba Group (BABA) all have or are gearing up to launch competing products. Apple's Home Pod, which will cost a lot more than the Echo at $399, is slated to launch in November. (See also: Amazon: Smart Speaker Shipments Jump 843% In Q2.)\n\nIt's not just the new devices that has gotten JMP Securities bullish on the stock. The firm has a market outperform rating and said the price cuts for the brand should also boost sales and extend its leadership in the burgeoning market. According to JMP, the Echo Generation 2 is 44% cheaper than the first iteration. He noted that Amazon likely sold around 15 million Echo devices since the launch three years ago, although that forecast may prove to be conservative. The e-commerce giant hasn't disclosed how many Echo speakers it has sold.", "The Porsche Cayman GT4 is the kind of velocity tool that doesn't need any aftermarket touch to shine, but don't expect this to keep owners from fitting their 911-engined Caymans with tuning bits. 7 photosLet's take the GT4 in the piece of footage at the bottom of the page, for instance. This Porscha has switched its factory rollers for a set of custom ones.\n\nNow wearing Vossen Wheels, this Porsche Cayman GT4 was ready to \"talk\" to the camera. We're looking at HC-1 rims, which feature an attention-grabbing five-spoke design.\n\nThe slim spokes and the angles of the design seem to perfectly suit the athletic design of the Zuffenhausen machine. And since we're dealing with uber-slim spokes, we can also take a good look at the machine's serious stopping hardware.\n\nTruth be told, it can be hard to focus on Porsche's mid-engined offerings with all the 911 action going on. Just yesterday, the German automotive producer announced that the 2018 GT2 RS set a new Nurburgring production car lap record. The Rennsport Neunelfer managed to go round the Green Hell in 6:47, which makes it a full ten seconds quicker than the 918 Spyder.\n\nThen there's the next-gen 911, with the 2019 model having recently been spotted testing on the German Autobahn. The greatest mystery revolving around the newcomer has to do with hybrid propulsion. While the carmaker denies the introduction of a gas-electric model, we could see the next-gen lineup involving two models of the kind, one that would rival the performance offered by the GTS badge and one that could get the Turbo S E-Hybrid badge.\n\nHowever, Porsche engineers are also testing a new 718 Cayman derivative these days, with the GTS incarnation of the mid-engined machine having been spotted on the Green Hell. The spyshots of the spiced-up coupe follow those of the 718 Boxster GTS, which is also preparing to enter the stage.\n\nPorsche Cayman GT4 porsche cayman Porsche custom wheels vossen wheels Just Say No to Fake Design Elements on Cars Parking Guide for Dummies Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed On Electric Harleys and New Generations The Dos and Don'ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part Two (Final) Project CARS 2 - Everything You Need To Know Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

In \"Origin\" (published October 3 by Doubleday), Langdon returns to unlock the mystery behind a famed futurist's discovery about the very existence of mankind.\n\nDon't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Dan Brown on CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" October 1!\n\nPrologue\n\nAs the ancient cogwheel train clawed its way up the dizzying incline, Edmond Kirsch surveyed the jagged mountaintop above him. In the distance, built into the face of a sheer cliff, the massive stone monastery seemed to hang in space, as if magically fused to the vertical precipice.\n\nThis timeless sanctuary in Catalonia, Spain, had endured the relentless pull of gravity for more than four centuries, never slipping from its original purpose: to insulate its occupants from the modern world.\n\nIronically, they will now be the first to learn the truth, Kirsch thought, wondering how they would react. Historically, the most dangerous men on earth were men of God ... especially when their gods became threatened. And I am about to hurl a flaming spear into a hornets' nest.\n\nWhen the train reached the mountaintop, Kirsch saw a solitary figure waiting for him on the platform. The wizened skeleton of a man was draped in the traditional Catholic purple cassock and white rochet, with a zucchetto on his head. Kirsch recognized his host's rawboned features from photos and felt an unexpected surge of adrenaline.\n\nValdespino is greeting me personally.\n\nBishop Antonio Valdespino was a formidable figure in Spain -- not only a trusted friend and counselor to the king himself, but one of the country's most vocal and influential advocates for the preservation of conservative Catholic values and traditional political standards.\n\n\"Edmond Kirsch, I assume?\" the bishop intoned as Kirsch exited the train.\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Kirsch said, smiling as he reached out to shake his host's bony hand. \"Bishop Valdespino, I want to thank you for arranging this meeting.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your requesting it.\" The bishop's voice was stronger than Kirsch expected -- clear and penetrating, like a bell. \"It is not often we are consulted by men of science, especially one of your prominence. This way, please.\"\n\nAs Valdespino guided Kirsch across the platform, the cold mountain air whipped at the bishop's cassock.\n\n\"I must confess,\" Valdespino said, \"you look different than I imagined. I was expecting a scientist, but you're quite ...\" He eyed his guest's sleek Kiton K50 suit and Barker ostrich shoes with a hint of disdain. \"'Hip,' I believe, is the word?\"\n\nKirsch smiled politely. The word \"hip\" went out of style decades ago.\n\n\"In reading your list of accomplishments,\" the bishop said, \"I am still not entirely sure what it is you do.\"\n\n\"I specialize in game theory and computer modeling.\"\n\n\"So you make the computer games that the children play?\"\n\nKirsch sensed the bishop was feigning ignorance in an attempt to be quaint. More accurately, Kirsch knew, Valdespino was a frighteningly well-informed student of technology and often warned others of its dangers. \"No, sir, actually game theory is a field of mathematics that studies patterns in order to make predictions about the future.\"\n\n\"Ah yes. I believe I read that you predicted a European monetary crisis some years ago? When nobody listened, you saved the day by inventing a computer program that pulled the EU back from the dead. What was your famous quote? 'At thirty-three years old, I am the same age as Christ when He performed His resurrection.'\"\n\nKirsch cringed. \"A poor analogy, Your Grace. I was young.\"\n\n\"Young?\" The bishop chuckled. \"And how old are you now ... perhaps forty?\"\n\n\"Just.\"\n\nThe old man smiled as the strong wind continued to billow his robe. \"Well, the meek were supposed to inherit the earth, but instead it has gone to the young -- the technically inclined, those who stare into video screens rather than into their own souls. I must admit, I never imagined I would have reason to meet the young man leading the charge. They call you a prophet, you know.\"\n\n\"Not a very good one in your case, Your Grace,\" Kirsch replied. \"When I asked if I might meet you and your colleagues privately, I calculated only a twenty percent chance you would accept.\"\n\n\"And as I told my colleagues, the devout can always benefit from listening to nonbelievers. It is in hearing the voice of the devil that we can better appreciate the voice of God.\" The old man smiled. \"I am joking, of course. Please forgive my aging sense of humor. My filters fail me from time to time.\"\n\nWith that, Bishop Valdespino motioned ahead. \"The others are waiting. This way, please.\"\n\nKirsch eyed their destination, a colossal citadel of gray stone perched on the edge of a sheer cliff that plunged thousands of feet down into a lush tapestry of wooded foothills. Unnerved by the height, Kirsch averted his eyes from the chasm and followed the bishop along the uneven cliffside path, turning his thoughts to the meeting ahead.\n\nKirsch had requested an audience with three prominent religious leaders who had just finished attending a conference here.\n\nThe Parliament of the World's Religions.\n\nSince 1893, hundreds of spiritual leaders from nearly thirty world religions had gathered in a different location every few years to spend a week engaged in interfaith dialogue. Participants included a wide array of influential Christian priests, Jewish rabbis, and Islamic mullahs from around the world, along with Hindu pujaris, Buddhist bhikkhus, Jains, Sikhs, and others.\n\nThe parliament's self-proclaimed objective was \"to cultivate harmony among the world's religions, build bridges between diverse spiritualities, and celebrate the intersections of all faith.\"\n\nA noble quest, Kirsch thought, despite seeing it as an empty exercise -- a meaningless search for random points of correspondence among a hodgepodge of ancient fictions, fables, and myths.\n\nAs Bishop Valdespino guided him along the pathway, Kirsch peered down the mountainside with a sardonic thought. Moses climbed a mountain to accept the Word of God . . . and I have climbed a mountain to do quite the opposite.\n\nKirsch's motivation for climbing this mountain, he had told himself, was one of ethical obligation, but he knew there was a good dose of hubris fueling this visit -- he was eager to feel the gratification of sitting face-to-face with these clerics and foretelling their imminent demise.\n\nYou've had your run at defining our truth.\n\n\"I looked at your curriculum vitae,\" the bishop said abruptly, glancing at Kirsch. \"I see you're a product of Harvard University?\"\n\n\"Undergraduate. Yes.\"\n\n\"I see. Recently, I read that for the first time in Harvard's history, the incoming student body consists of more atheists and agnostics than those who identify as followers of any religion. That is quite a telling statistic, Mr. Kirsch.\"\n\nWhat can I tell you, Kirsch wanted to reply, our students keep getting smarter.\n\nThe wind whipped harder as they arrived at the ancient stone edifice. Inside the dim light of the building's entryway, the air was heavy with the thick fragrance of burning frankincense. The two men snaked through a maze of dark corridors, and Kirsch's eyes fought to adjust as he followed his cloaked host. Finally, they arrived at an unusually small wooden door. The bishop knocked, ducked down, and entered, motioning for his guest to follow.\n\nUncertain, Kirsch stepped over the threshold.\n\nHe found himself in a rectangular chamber whose high walls burgeoned with ancient leather-bound tomes. Additional freestanding bookshelves jutted out of the walls like ribs, interspersed with cast-iron radiators that clanged and hissed, giving the room the eerie sense that it was alive. Kirsch raised his eyes to the ornately balustraded walkway that encircled the second story and knew without a doubt where he was.\n\nThe famed library of Montserrat, he realized, startled to have been admitted. This sacred room was rumored to contain uniquely rare texts accessible only to those monks who had devoted their lives to God and who were sequestered here on this mountain.\n\n\"You asked for discretion,\" the bishop said. \"This is our most private space. Few outsiders have ever entered.\"\n\n\"A generous privilege. Thank you.\"\n\nKirsch followed the bishop to a large wooden table where two elderly men sat waiting. The man on the left looked timeworn, with tired eyes and a matted white beard. He wore a crumpled black suit, white shirt, and fedora.\n\n\"This is Rabbi Yehuda K\u00f6ves,\" the bishop said. \"He is a prominent Jewish philosopher who has written extensively on Kabbalistic cosmology.\"\n\nKirsch reached across the table and politely shook hands with Rabbi K\u00f6ves. \"A pleasure to meet you, sir,\" Kirsch said. \"I've read your books on Kabbala. I can't say I understood them, but I've read them.\"\n\nK\u00f6ves gave an amiable nod, dabbing at his watery eyes with his handkerchief.\n\n\"And here,\" the bishop continued, motioning to the other man, \"you have the respected allamah, Syed al-Fadl.\"\n\nThe revered Islamic scholar stood up and smiled broadly. He was short and squat with a jovial face that seemed a mismatch with his dark penetrating eyes. He was dressed in an unassuming white thawb. \"And, Mr. Kirsch, I have read your predictions on the future of mankind. I can't say I agree with them, but I have read them.\"\n\nKirsch gave a gracious smile and shook the man's hand.\n\n\"And our guest, Edmond Kirsch,\" the bishop concluded, addressing his two colleagues, \"as you know, is a highly regarded computer scientist, game theorist, inventor, and something of a prophet in the technological world. Considering his background, I was puzzled by his request to address the three of us. Therefore, I shall now leave it to Mr. Kirsch to explain why he has come.\"\n\nWith that, Bishop Valdespino took a seat between his two colleagues, folded his hands, and gazed up expectantly at Kirsch. All three men faced him like a tribunal, creating an ambience more like that of an inquisition than a friendly meeting of scholars. The bishop, Kirsch now realized, had not even set out a chair for him.\n\nKirsch felt more bemused than intimidated as he studied the three aging men before him. So this is the Holy Trinity I requested. The Three Wise Men.\n\nPausing a moment to assert his power, Kirsch walked over to the window and gazed out at the breathtaking panorama below. A sunlit patchwork of ancient pastoral lands stretched across a deep valley, giving way to the rugged peaks of the Collserola mountain range. Miles beyond, somewhere out over the Balearic Sea, a menacing bank of storm clouds was now gathering on the horizon.\n\nFitting, Kirsch thought, sensing the turbulence he would soon cause in this room, and in the world beyond.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he commenced, turning abruptly back toward them. \"I believe Bishop Valdespino has already conveyed to you my request for secrecy. Before we continue, I just want to clarify that what I am about to share with you must be kept in the strictest confidence. Simply stated, I am asking for a vow of silence from all of you. Are we in agreement?\"\n\nAll three men gave nods of tacit acquiescence, which Kirsch knew were probably redundant anyway. They will want to bury this information -- not broadcast it.\n\n\"I am here today,\" Kirsch began, \"because I have made a scientific discovery I believe you will find startling. It is something I have pursued for many years, hoping to provide answers to two of the most fundamental questions of our human experience. Now that I have succeeded, I have come to you specifically because I believe this information will affect the world's faithful in a profound way, quite possibly causing a shift that can only be described as, shall we say -- disruptive. At the moment, I am the only person on earth who has the information I am about to reveal to you.\"\n\nKirsch reached into his suit coat and pulled out an oversized smartphone -- one that he had designed and built to serve his own unique needs. The phone had a vibrantly colored mosaic case, and he propped it up before the three men like a television. In a moment, he would use the device to dial into an ultrasecure server, enter his forty-seven-character password, and live-stream a presentation for them.\n\n\"What you are about to see,\" Kirsch said, \"is a rough cut of an announcement I hope to share with the world -- perhaps in a month or so. But before I do, I wanted to consult with a few of the world's most influential religious thinkers, to gain insight into how this news will be received by those it affects most.\"\n\nThe bishop sighed loudly, sounding more bored than concerned. \"An intriguing preamble, Mr. Kirsch. You speak as if whatever you are about to show us will shake the foundations of the world's religions.\"\n\nKirsch glanced around the ancient repository of sacred texts. It will not shake your foundations. It will shatter them.\n\nKirsch appraised the men before him. What they did not know was that in only three days' time, Kirsch planned to go public with this presentation in a stunning, meticulously choreographed event. When he did, people across the world would realize that the teachings of all religions did indeed have one thing in common.\n\nProfessor Robert Langdon gazed up at the forty-foot-tall dog sitting in the plaza. The animal's fur was a living carpet of grass and fragrant flowers.\n\nI'm trying to love you, he thought. I truly am.\n\nLangdon pondered the creature a bit longer and then continued along a suspended walkway, descending a sprawling terrace of stairs whose uneven treads were intended to jar the arriving visitor from his usual rhythm and gait. Mission accomplished, Langdon decided, nearly stumbling twice on the irregular steps.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, Langdon jolted to a stop, staring at a massive object that loomed ahead.\n\nNow I've seen it all.\n\nA towering black widow spider rose before him, its slender iron legs supporting a bulbous body at least thirty feet in the air. On the spider's underbelly hung a wire-mesh egg sac filled with glass orbs.\n\n\"Her name is Maman,\" a voice said.\n\nLangdon lowered his gaze and saw a slender man standing beneath the spider. He wore a black brocade sherwani and had an almost comical curling Salvador Dal\u00ed mustache.\n\n\"My name is Fernando,\" he continued, \"and I'm here to welcome you to the museum.\" The man perused a collection of name tags on a table before him. \"May I have your name, please?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Robert Langdon.\"\n\nThe man's eyes shot back up. \"Ah, I am so sorry! I did not recognize you, sir!\"\n\nI barely recognize myself, Langdon thought, advancing stiffly in his white bow tie, black tails, and white waistcoat. I look like a Whiffenpoof. Langdon's classic tails were almost thirty years old, preserved from his days as a member of the Ivy Club at Princeton, but thanks to his faithful daily regimen of swimming laps, the outfit still fit him fairly well. In Langdon's haste to pack, he had grabbed the wrong hanging bag from his closet, leaving his usual tuxedo behind.\n\n\"The invitation said black and white,\" Langdon said. \"I trust tails are appropriate?\"\n\n\"Tails are a classic! You look dashing!\" The man scurried over and carefully pressed a name tag to the lapel of Langdon's jacket.\n\n\"It's an honor to meet you, sir,\" the mustached man said. \"No doubt you've visited us before?\"\n\nLangdon gazed through the spider's legs at the glistening building before them. \"Actually, I'm embarrassed to say, I've never been.\"\n\n\"No!\" The man feigned falling over. \"You're not a fan of modern art?\"\n\nLangdon had always enjoyed the challenge of modern art -- primarily the exploration of why particular works were hailed as masterpieces: Jackson Pollock's drip paintings; Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup cans; Mark Rothko's simple rectangles of color. Even so, Langdon was far more comfortable discussing the religious symbolism of Hieronymus Bosch or the brushwork of Francisco de Goya.\n\n\"I'm more of a classicist,\" Langdon replied. \"I do better with da Vinci than with de Kooning.\"\n\n\"But da Vinci and de Kooning are so similar!\"\n\nLangdon smiled patiently. \"Then I clearly have a bit to learn about de Kooning.\"\n\n\"Well, you've come to the right place!\" The man swung his arm toward the massive building. \"In this museum, you will find one of the finest collections of modern art on earth! I do hope you enjoy.\"\n\n\"I intend to,\" Langdon replied. \"I only wish I knew why I'm here.\"\n\n\"You and everyone else!\" The man laughed merrily, shaking his head. \"Your host has been very secretive about the purpose of tonight's event. Not even the museum staff knows what's happening. The mystery is half the fun of it -- rumors are running wild! There are several hundred guests inside -- many famous faces -- and nobody has any idea what's on the agenda tonight!\"\n\nNow Langdon grinned. Very few hosts on earth would have the bravado to send out last-minute invitations that essentially read: Saturday night. Be there. Trust me. And even fewer would be able to persuade hun\u00addreds of VIPs to drop everything and fly to northern Spain to attend the event.\n\nLangdon walked out from beneath the spider and continued along the pathway, glancing up at an enormous red banner that billowed overhead.\n\nAN EVENING WITH EDMOND KIRSCH\n\nEdmond has certainly never lacked confidence, Langdon thought, amused.\n\nSome twenty years ago, young Eddie Kirsch had been one of Langdon's first students at Harvard University -- a mop-haired computer geek whose interest in codes had led him to Langdon's freshman seminar: Codes, Ciphers, and the Language of Symbols. The sophistication of Kirsch's intellect had impressed Langdon deeply, and although Kirsch eventually abandoned the dusty world of semiotics for the shining prom\u00adise of computers, he and Langdon had developed a student-teacher bond that had kept them in contact over the past two decades since Kirsch's graduation.\n\nNow the student has surpassed his teacher, Langdon thought. By several light-years.\n\nToday, Edmond Kirsch was a world-renowned maverick -- a billionaire computer scientist, futurist, inventor, and entrepreneur. The forty-year-old had fathered an astounding array of advanced technologies that represented major leaps forward in fields as diverse as robotics, brain science, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. And his accurate predictions about future scientific breakthroughs had created a mystical aura around the man.\n\nLangdon suspected that Edmond's eerie knack for prognostication stemmed from his astoundingly broad knowledge of the world around him. For as long as Langdon could remember, Edmond had been an insatiable bibliophile -- reading everything in sight. The man's passion for books, and his capacity for absorbing their contents, surpassed anything Langdon had ever witnessed.\n\nFor the past few years, Kirsch had lived primarily in Spain, attributing his choice to an ongoing love affair with the country's old-world charm, avant-garde architecture, eccentric gin bars, and perfect weather.\n\nOnce a year, when Kirsch returned to Cambridge to speak at the MIT Media Lab, Langdon would join him for a meal at one of the trendy new Boston hot spots that Langdon had never heard of. Their conversations were never about technology; all Kirsch ever wanted to discuss with Langdon was the arts.\n\n\"You're my culture connection, Robert,\" Kirsch often joked. \"My own private bachelor of arts!\"\n\nThe playful jab at Langdon's marital status was particularly ironic coming from a fellow bachelor who denounced monogamy as \"an affront to evolution\" and had been photographed with a wide range of supermodels over the years.\n\nConsidering Kirsch's reputation as an innovator in computer science, one could easily have imagined him being a buttoned-up techno-nerd. But he had instead fashioned himself into a modern pop icon who moved in celebrity circles, dressed in the latest styles, listened to arcane underground music, and collected a wide array of priceless Impressionist and modern art. Kirsch often e-mailed Langdon to get his advice on new pieces of art he was considering for his collection.\n\nAnd then he would do the exact opposite, Langdon mused.\n\nAbout a year ago, Kirsch had surprised Langdon by asking him not about art, but about God -- an odd topic for a self-proclaimed atheist. Over a plate of short-rib crudo at Boston's Tiger Mama, Kirsch had picked Langdon's brain on the core beliefs of various world religions, in particular their different stories of the Creation.\n\nLangdon gave him a solid overview of current beliefs, from the Gen\u00adesis story shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all the way through the Hindu story of Brahma, the Babylonian tale of Marduk, and others.\n\n\"I'm curious,\" Langdon asked as they left the restaurant. \"Why is a futurist so interested in the past? Does this mean our famous atheist has finally found God?\"\n\nEdmond let out a hearty laugh. \"Wishful thinking! I'm just sizing up my competition, Robert.\"\n\nLangdon smiled. Typical. \"Well, science and religion are not competitors, they're two different languages trying to tell the same story. There's room in this world for both.\"\n\nAfter that meeting, Edmond had dropped out of contact for almost a year. And then, out of the blue, three days ago, Langdon had received a FedEx envelope with a plane ticket, a hotel reservation, and a handwritten note from Edmond urging him to attend tonight's event. It read: Robert, it would mean the world to me if you of all people could attend. Your insights during our last conversation helped make this night possible.\n\nLangdon was baffled. Nothing about that conversation seemed remotely relevant to an event that would be hosted by a futurist.\n\nThe FedEx envelope also included a black-and-white image of two people standing face-to-face. Kirsch had written a short poem to Langdon.\n\nLangdon smiled when he saw the image -- a clever allusion to an episode in which Langdon had been involved several years earlier. The silhouette of a chalice, or Grail cup, revealed itself in the empty space between the two faces.\n\nNow Langdon stood outside this museum, eager to learn what his former student was about to announce. A light breeze ruffled his jacket tails as he moved along the cement walkway on the bank of the meandering Nervi\u00f3n River, which had once been the lifeblood of a thriving industrial city. The air smelled vaguely of copper.\n\nAs Langdon rounded a bend in the pathway, he finally permitted himself to look at the massive, glimmering museum. The structure was impossible to take in at a glance. Instead, his gaze traced back and forth along the entire length of the bizarre, elongated forms.\n\nThis building doesn't just break the rules, Langdon thought. It ignores them completely. A perfect spot for Edmond.\n\nThe Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, looked like something out of an alien hallucination -- a swirling collage of warped metallic forms that appeared to have been propped up against one another in an almost random way. Stretching into the distance, the chaotic mass of shapes was draped in more than thirty thousand titanium tiles that glinted like fish scales and gave the structure a simultaneously organic and extraterrestrial feel, as if some futuristic leviathan had crawled out of the water to sun herself on the riverbank.\n\nWhen the building was first unveiled in 1997, The New Yorker hailed its architect, Frank Gehry, as having designed \"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\" while other critics around the world gushed, \"The greatest building of our time!\" \"Mercurial brilliance!\" \"An astonishing architectural feat!\"\n\nSince the museum's debut, dozens of other \"deconstructivist\" buildings had been erected -- the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, BMW World in Munich, and even the new library at Langdon's own alma mater. Each featured radically unconventional design and construction, and yet Langdon doubted any of them could compete with the Bilbao Guggenheim for its sheer shock value.\n\nAs Langdon approached, the tiled facade seemed to morph with each step, offering a fresh personality from every angle. The museum's most dramatic illusion now became visible. Incredibly, from this perspective, the colossal structure appeared to be quite literally floating on water, adrift on a vast \"infinity\" lagoon that lapped against the museum's outer walls.\n\nLangdon paused a moment to marvel at the effect and then set out to cross the lagoon via the minimalist footbridge that arched over the glassy expanse of water. He was only halfway across when a loud hissing noise startled him. It was emanating from beneath his feet. He stopped short just as a swirling cloud of mist began billowing out from beneath the walkway. The thick veil of fog rose around him and then tumbled outward across the lagoon, rolling toward the museum and engulfing the base of the entire structure.\n\nThe Fog Sculpture, Langdon thought.\n\nHe had read about this work by Japanese artist Fujiko Nakaya. The \"sculpture\" was revolutionary in that it was constructed out of the medium of visible air, a wall of fog that materialized and dissipated over time; and because the breezes and atmospheric conditions were never identical one day to the next, the sculpture was different every time it appeared.\n\nThe bridge stopped hissing, and Langdon watched the wall of fog settle silently across the lagoon, swirling and creeping as if it had a mind of its own. The effect was both ethereal and disorienting. The entire museum now appeared to be hovering over the water, resting weightlessly on a cloud -- a ghost ship lost at sea.\n\nJust as Langdon was about to set out again, the tranquil surface of the water was shattered by a series of small eruptions. Suddenly five flaming pillars of fire shot skyward out of the lagoon, thundering steadily like rocket engines that pierced the mist-laden air and threw brilliant bursts of light across the museum's titanium tiles.\n\nLangdon's own architectural taste tended more to the classical stylings of museums like the Louvre or the Prado, and yet as he watched the fog and flame hover above the lagoon, he could think of no place more suitable than this ultramodern museum to host an event thrown by a man who loved art and innovation, and who glimpsed the future so clearly.\n\nNow, walking through the mist, Langdon pressed on to the museum's entrance -- an ominous black hole in the reptilian structure. As he neared the threshold, Langdon had the uneasy sense that he was entering the mouth of a dragon.", "SIR JAMES DYSON does not lack ambition. In an e-mail to the staff of his electrical-appliance company on September 26th he reiterated his long-held desire to \"find a solution to the global problem of air pollution\". His audacious scheme is to add an electric vehicle to the catalogue of pricey vacuum cleaners, fans and hairdryers already manufactured by the company that he owns.\n\nHis plan to invest \u00a32bn ($2.7bn), split evenly between battery technology and vehicle development, shows that the barriers to entry in the battery-powered vehicle business are much lower than those in the market for cars with complex internal-combustion engines. But Sir James may find that the barriers to success are more formidable.\n\nDetails of his new project are thin. Sir James said that he had assembled a team of over 400 people and was still recruiting, with the aim of launching a vehicle in 2020. It seems likely that the first cars will aim at the luxury market, a niche that Tesla has to itself. The California-based electric-car maker, which was founded less than 15 years ago, hopes to make half a million cars in 2018. It is surely the firm that Sir James means to emulate. But Tesla has tapped investors for $10bn since 2012 and has yet to make an annual profit. The experience of Apple is as instructive. The computer giant recently abandoned plans to make its own cars when the cost and complexity of the task became apparent. Instead it will concentrate on self-driving systems.\n\nDyson's manufacturing nous puts it in a stronger starting position than Apple, though managing the supply chain for a vacuum cleaner hardly compares to that for a car. The firm's experience with batteries, gained from its cordless cleaners, is an advantage. And the solid-state battery technology that it is pursuing could prove much cheaper and more efficient than the lithium-ion batteries currently used by all other carmakers. Toyota is trying to make the same battery breakthrough. Sceptics question whether the technology is yet anywhere close to mass production.\n\nEven if a Dyson car is ready to hit the road in 2020, Sir James faces other obstacles. Though demand for electric vehicles is expected to grow quickly as governments turn against the internal-combustion engine, there may soon be a traffic jam at the high end of the market. Next year Jaguar is due to launch the iPace, a competitor to Tesla's Model S. Porsche, Audi and BMW all have models that will arrive by 2020. They may be joined by others from a host of startups. Finding buyers is another challenge. Tesla has had to spend heavily setting up its own retail network to sidestep the established dealerships of big carmakers.\n\nThe badge on the front of a luxury car is all-important. A brand shared with washroom hand-dryers may lack sufficient allure. But in 24 years Dyson has become a company with revenues of \u00a32.5bn, a triumph of marketing as much as clever technology. That knack for salesmanship could translate to the car business. Sir James, like Elon Musk of Tesla, seems untroubled by self-doubt. It remains to be seen whether he can clean up again -- or whether the car business will simply hoover up his fortune.", "It's no secret that the car has always been a status symbol, and is even seen by some as an extension of their character. Are you a BMW or an Audi person? Are you about fuel efficiency or speed? Are you trying to wow onlookers or are you just trying to get your family from A to B?\n\nFrom a marketing and PR perspective, with over 95% of vehicle shoppers now using digital channels to research cars, social is pivotal. It's become a virtual showroom for the world to see the latest products on the market and what's coming in the future.\n\nBut as with many industries, the automotive sector is starting to experience the kind of disruption that's seriously altering the status quo. BMW, Ford, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Toyota and other auto stalwarts are seeing challenges from a new generation of electric and soon autonomous vehicles - from relatively new brands like Tesla to non-automotive brands like Google and Apple.\n\nThat's we at Talkwalker decided to do a deep dive into the automotive industry on social media for our latest report, to see who's racing to the front and who's getting left in the dust. And our research uncovered one story, in particular, that stood out.\n\nThere are many different facets of our report that I think merit discussion, but for me, the most fascinating is the incredible strength of Tesla from a social media marketing perspective. Here's a brand that was founded just fifteen years ago, makes comparatively little money relative to automotive giants, yet on social media, they are in the top three - outperforming Volkswagen, Ford and Toyota, to name but a few.\n\nThis is pretty staggering - we've done a great deal of industry social media analyses in our time and as a general rule, bigger companies tend to outperform their smaller rivals. There are exceptions of course, but for a company that's almost 30x smaller than its rivals, to perform so well is pretty much unheard of.\n\nBelow is a graph showing the total mentions across social channels of twenty-nine of the world's biggest car brands:\n\nThere's still some hesitancy from CEOs when to taking to social media, but Elon Musk certainly doesn't fit into that category. In fact, I think there is an argument to be made that Musk's public popularity has a greater impact on his company than any other business leader.\n\nFrom a follower numbers perspective, only Bill Gates with 38m+ followers can overcome Musk's 12.5 million on Twitter - but it's more than just his \"numbers\".\n\nFrom a social perspective, Musk is also pretty personal. From talking about his new business ideas during his drive home to live tweeting rocket launches, his posts offer an inside view of what he cares about and is interested in at any particular moment. And he's not afraid to talk about failure either:\n\nCompare this to other CEOs on social with similar name recognition - say Tim Cook of Apple or Satya Nadella of Microsoft, who mostly focus on corporate updates with occasional forays into current affairs.\n\nThis isn't an approach that necessarily works for everyone, but when you've built a hype machine as Tesla has done, the rules of social media start to change.\n\nInstead of following the usual guidelines of \"tweet this much, include videos\" etc., you start to make your own. Tesla has only tweeted four times this month.\n\nWhy? Because they don't really need to do any more than that. Despite this lack of activity they are still in the top three most talked about car brands this month.\n\nAnd when they do tweet?\n\nThis was their most shared tweet in the dataset we examined.\n\nAgain, it's not necessarily an approach that everyone can copy, but when you've got the world hanging on your every word, sometimes less is more.\n\nSo what is it about Tesla that has captured the imagination? This is very difficult to put your finger on exactly, but I'd say one element of it is that a lot of people buy into Musk's vision of the future.\n\nWhether it's sleek, environmentally friendly electric cars, smart solar panels, smart batteries, or private space exploration, it's a vision that people want to follow, or at the very least know more about.\n\nFrom a social media marketing perspective, it's no surprise then that Tesla is the car brand most linked to topics like electric cars and autonomous vehicles on social, even though established car makers are investing just as much if not significantly more than Tesla in these areas.\n\nThe chart below shows the percentage of the social discussion held by each brand on the subject of electric vehicles:\n\nAnd the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles is? It certainly isn't Tesla. It's actually Renault-Nissan, all the way down in 11th on our list.\n\nTesla and Musk have managed to create a perception of themselves that enables them to compete, and really, outperform auto rivals on social.\n\nIt's difficult in many ways for established players to do what Tesla do in putting a single person front and center of their brand. Brands like BMW, Toyota, and Ford were founded decades ago and not every founder has the charisma and eccentricity of Elon Musk.\n\nBut providing a personalized, insider view on social media can help humanize your brand. Whether it's the CEO, another executive or a group of employees, consumers are increasingly interested in the people and values behind a brand (especially the big ones), not just the products. Musk's - and by proxy, Tesla's - popularity resides in his willingness to share his random thoughts, ideas, and even failures; where other executives, understandably, prefer to play it safe.\n\nThe problem is, social media is now such a noisy landscape that \"playing it safe\" isn't really enough to cut through the background noise. It may be a bit uncomfortable at the beginning, but now is the time for CEOs and executives to start being more visible on social media.\n\nYour customers (and investors) are talking about you anyway, being on social lets you at least play some role in shaping their perception.", "Audi will have its own team lining up on the grid for the 2017/2018 season of the Formula E Championship.

And the new 4K Amazon Fire TV poses a direct threat to Apple's new digital media player, Apple TV 4K, which was announced earlier this month and arrived in stores last Friday.\n\nWriting today in ZDNet, Steve Ranger called Amazon's latest Echo announcements a \"land grab\" for leadership in the smart-home device space.\n\n\"Amazon sells its hardware cheap because making money that way is not (at least for now) its priority,\" he said. \"This is a land-grab; whichever company reaches enough homes fast enough will become the effective standard.\"\n\nThe wider Amazon Alexa's reach into people's devices and homes becomes, the greater the threat it also poses to other intelligent assistants such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby.\n\nEnterprise Deals with BMW, Randstad\n\nAmazon yesterday also announced two big wins on the enterprise side of its business: a new deal with BMW to integrate Alexa into its vehicles, and a plan by staffing and recruitment company Randstad to move its IT infrastructure onto Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nUnder the BMW partnership, the Germany-based automaker expects to start making Amazon Alexa available in its BMW and Mini vehicles started in mid-2018. Alexa's assistance will be available via voice commands and will also be integrated with in-car visual control displays. The integration will let drivers ask for directions, launch phone calls, listen to music or news, check weather forecasts, and remotely control smart devices in their homes.\n\nThe Randstad deal, meanwhile, will see the company move its entire global IT infrastructure to AWS over the coming year. Randstad said the migration is aimed at improving efficiencies and costs and aligning its infrastructure with its digital transformation and innovation goals."], "2017-09-29": ["WASHINGTON - Here is what's around the corner: Smart digital billboards will detect the make, model and year of oncoming vehicles and project ads tailored to the motorist.\n\nRoadside cameras will read license plates, and powerful computers will make snap judgments based on likely home address, age, race and income level to pitch products or services through the billboards.\n\nOnce ads flash up on roadside digital screens, the sales pitch may not stop. Any mobile phones in a passing vehicle may light up with a reinforcing message linked to the ad.\n\nAlready here\n\nA series of factors are reshaping the quintessential experience of the road trip or job commute. Smart billboards are already here, gracing the sides of bus shelters, urban interstates and pedestrian walkways.\n\nAnd as the digital billboards grow in size and number -- rotating ads, customizing them to passing traffic and earning far more income -- old-fashioned billboards face an existential moment.\n\nThrow in artificial intelligence and powerful computers, and the roadside experience is on the cusp of change. Digital electronic billboards actually stare at us -- and make judgments about who we are and how we might spend our money.\n\nVehicle matters\n\nA big unknown: the impact of self-driving automobiles on both old-style \"dumb\" billboards and their smarter progeny.\n\n\"Often your car is a proxy for demographics. We get several ad agencies who say, I want to advertise to affluent men over $100,000 (in annual salary) with XYZ education. Often driving a BMW or an Audi is a proxy for that,\" said Kevin Foreman, general manager of geoanalytics at INRIX, a Kirkland, Wash., company that gathers and sells real-time traffic information.\n\nTo determine make, model and year of cars on the road, start-up companies marry powerful computing, roadside sensors or cameras and pinpoint advertising.\n\nLibraries about cars\n\nOne of them is Synaps Labs. Its co-founder and chief executive, Alex Pustov, said the company installs roadside cameras roughly 600 to 650 feet in front of electronic billboards. The cameras feed images of oncoming cars through a cellular signal to a computer.\n\nPacked in the computer's memory are some 2,000 different images of each of 1,600 makes and models of cars, he said.\n\n\"Initially, it was labor intensive. We needed to collect millions of images,\" Pustov said. \"We manually created libraries of car makes and models.\"\n\nPerfect target\n\nIt only takes a second or so to transmit and digest the image and channel back a targeted ad that a driver would see for eight or nine seconds, Pustov said.\n\nWhen multiple lanes are filled with traffic, the computer can determine broad groups of targets, say, owners of older automobiles, and flash ads accordingly.\n\n\"Most car companies want to advertise to seven- to 12-year-old cars. They don't want to advertise to a 1- to 2-year-old car,\" Foreman said. \"Ford spending money on you when you've just bought a new Ford is lousy. But me, I have a 12-year-old Ford. I'm a great candidate.\"\n\n'Out of home'\n\nSmart billboards can also target motorists on the highway or pedestrians passing bus shelters by picking up cellular or mobile signatures, Wi-Fi signals or even beaconing given off by certain apps.\n\nThe billboard sector, or what the industry prefers to call \"out of home\" advertising, comprises $7.5 billion of the $185 billion annual U.S. advertising market, said Andrew R. Sriubas, chief commercial officer at OUTFRONT Media, one of the nation's big three outdoor advertisers.\n\n'What you are'\n\nIndustry experts are cautious to note that the data harvesting is anonymous, hoping not to evoke the creepy billboards of the 2002 movie Minority Report in which a protagonist finds signage addressed to him directly.\n\n\"It doesn't have to know who you are. It needs to know what you are. It says I see phone ID 453ABCD. I happen to know that phone number is associated with a millennial Hispanic female, therefore send it this ad,\" Sriubas said.\n\nGPS tracking\n\nMoreover, the data industry collects vast information about the whereabouts of mobile users by the apps on their smart phones, which share global positioning system, or GPS, signals every 15 seconds.\n\n\"When you click 'I allow' on your favorite mobile app, if they're a partner of ours ... you most likely are anonymously sending us your GPS point heading,\" Foreman said.\n\nThat is partly why INRIX says it can anonymously track the GPS signals of over 300 million drivers in 65 countries. Moreover, one in four cars coming onto the road today emit their own GPS signals.\n\n'Detects gaits'\n\nSmart billboards can consider other factors for targeting such as time of day, weather conditions and upcoming events. A digital sign catering to pedestrians can also make judgments.\n\n\"It can detect gaits. So it understands male versus female, it understands kids versus adults,\" Sriubas said. \"There's a bunch of very sophisticated algorithms that it can understand.\"\n\nUsing that data, he added, \"I know you're male or female. I know you're within a certain age category, 30 to 40. I know that you live in this location and you work in that location.\"\n\nJaguar campaign\n\nSmart ads for cars may riff off the seasonal weather or time of day.\n\n\"For a Jaguar campaign that we did,\" Pustov said, referring to a smart campaign in his native Moscow, \"when it was snowing they were showing a Jaguar ad that demonstrated the car is very comfortable in the snow.\"\n\nWhen weather was better and little traffic was on the road, \"they were saying it's a very powerful car.\"", "A KIDNAP victim stands naked in the street moments after escaping a gang who beat him senseless and bundled him into the boot of a BMW.\n\nBrave Emmanuel Chidubem Emmanuel, 27, was comforted by a bystander after having single-handedly fought off four thugs.\n\nA trial yesterday heard the brutes stripped, beat and bound the garage boss before stuffing him in the car and speeding off.\n\nBut Emmanuel sprang from the boot of the car to battle the thugs in Buckstone, Edinburgh.\n\nOne witness said: \"It was horrifying and bizarre.\"\n\nHe was lured to a house by the brutes who punched, kicked and battered him with a blunt weapon -- then stripped, bound and blindfolded him.\n\nHooman Sojoodi, Sanchez Facey, Glen Elamo and Arnold Mukueto bundled him into the 5 Series Beemer's boot and sped off from Gilmerton, Edinburgh.\n\nBut he worked himself free as they drove and yanked fuses from an electrics box to short circuit the motor.\n\nHe told the High Court in Edinburgh of his miracle escape: \"I got my face and my mouth out.\n\n\"I found something in the boot that I used to get the bonds on my legs off.\n\n\"Then I tried to kick my way out.

On the second floor, a performing arts center will offer below-market rates for instructors of dance, arts, and music.\n\n\"Do you know how impactful that is for a child from any of these areas, who is like me, to come out and see people actually painting in the window, or performing on a saxophone?\" Pilgram said. \"That creates a fire under most children. Now they say, wow, anything out there that's creative, I can be. Whatever artist I want to be, I can be.\"\n\nBack in Memphis, Pilgram said he had role models who shaped him.\n\nHis father was hard-working. His mother was a devout Seventh-day Adventist who had him in church several days a week. When he got older, he joined the Navy. Then he embarked on a career in the cruise line industry, climbing to a top position, and learning to work with large budgets like the one now under his own name.\n\nIn his world travels, he said he visited cultures where people marveled at his \"beautiful\" brown skin. He said he wants children in Fort Lauderdale's historic black community to experience that feeling of value as an African American.\n\nBut he also saw what can happen when private investment is lacking, he said, and government comes in to rebuild. In Memphis, he said, his grandmother's apartment was razed, and the residents displaced. He feared it could happen here, and said that's one thing that drew him to Sistrunk Boulevard.\n\n'It could be you'\n\nEvery week, Pilgram spent $20 on lottery tickets. But he wasn't good about checking them.\n\nThen one night he ran to the Shell gas station in North Bay Village where he bought his tickets. He left chicken cacciatore and his girlfriend at home, and was in a hurry. He just needed a bottle of wine.\n\nDavid, the gas station employee, was insistent. Someone had bought the winning Florida Lotto ticket at that gas station, he told Pilgram, and \"it could be you.\"\n\nPilgram got the tickets from his car, and one of them hit: 15-16-20-32-45-50.\n\nDavid started \"jumping up and down,\" Pilgram said.\n\n\"$52,000?\" Pilgram thought he heard through David's Spanish accent.\n\nNo, not thousand. 52 million.\n\nReviving history\n\nSistrunk Boulevard hasn't had a nightclub with live music like Pilgram plans in at least 25 years, City Commissioner Robert McKinzie said. Back then, the property Pilgram bought, at the southeast corner of Northwest 15th Avenue and Sistrunk, was the buzzing Night Owl lounge.\n\nThe boulevard was once vibrant. Now, vacant lots and empty buildings sit on many of the blocks. The city, a major landowner on Sistrunk, has worked for years to encourage private investment. McKinzie said the pieces are finally falling into place, and he's \"excited\" about Pilgram's role in it.\n\n\"Now that we are reviving it,\" McKinzie said of Sistrunk Boulevard, \"his plan and concept fit right in.\"\n\nNext to Pilgram's planned performing arts center, on the north side of Sistrunk between Northwest 14th Way and 14th Terrace, the city recently agreed to spend $10 million building a new YMCA where the old Mizell Center is. Development has finally come to public land at Sistrunk and Northwest 7th Avenue, a grocery store and shopping plaza that took decades to come to fruition. A developer is now proposing micro-residential units and retail directly across the street, McKinzie said.\n\nLongtime members of the community around Sistrunk have heard for years that an economic revival was right around the corner. Standing in his crossing guard gear at Pilgram's building, Charles Zeigler, 67, said he believes it.\n\n\"It's coming,\" he said after Pilgram told him his plans. \"It's a process.\"\n\nThe restaurant and blues club -- a renovation of the original 1940s building -- will be open in about a year, if all goes according to Pilgram's plan. He purchased the property in May.\n\nHis vision next to the Mizell Center, where he's still working to purchase multiple pieces of property that span the block, could come to fruition in Spring of 2019.\n\nWinning was 'confirmation'\n\nThe Sistrunk investment isn't his only endeavor.\n\nPilgram is working on a clothing line of men's shirts, has other real estate dealings, bought a condo at Fort Lauderdale beach to renovate and make his home, and is renovating a two-story building at 107 SW 6th St., next to his office, just down the street from the Broward County Courthouse. It will open in the coming months as a New York Subs and Wings restaurant and jazz lounge.\n\nOutside his office, the license plate of his black BMW reflects what's on his mind: \"AMB1SHN.\"\n\nHe said he feels an urgency that many people don't. When he was in his late 20s, Pilgram intervened when a man outside the blues club he managed in Memphis was being beaten and robbed. Pilgram chased the man, who pulled out a gun and shot him.\n\nWhen he reflected on his survival, Pilgram said he felt a conviction that he was going to have a \"positive global impact.\"\n\nThough he's often called lucky, Pilgram said he doesn't believe in luck. He didn't know what the numbers on the winning ticket were, saying he never really looked. Rather, he felt that winning was \"confirmation\" from his Creator, he said, after treating people \"with such integrity and honor my whole life.\"\n\nLottery winning history is a mixed bag. Many winners have seen their lives pulled apart, their winnings sapped. Not so for Pilgram.\n\n\"It's been 1,000 percent positive,\" he said. \"Whatever you are before you come into success, you're going to be more of that when you get there. ... The only thing you require more of is discipline, and the Navy gave me all of that I would ever need.\"\n\nBrittany Wallman can be reached at bwallman@sun-sentinel.com or 954-356-4541.

Samsung committed to the same specification for its flagship Galaxy smartphones; in all, about 90 smartphone models use Qi today, making it the industry's most popular among three standards. In addition to desktop charging stations (typically in the form of small charging pads), the automotive marketplace has also adopted in-cabin wireless charging.\n\nNearly 80 car models, from Audi, Chevrolet and KIA to Hyundai, Nissan and BMW, offer in-cabin wireless charging based on the electromagnetic Qi charging specification.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 public Qi charging locations worldwide, according to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the entity in charge of the Qi standard.\n\nMajor brands like McDonald's, Marriott, Ibis and others have built Qi into their properties. Airports, such as London Heathrow, Philadelphia and others around the world, have Qi charging stations. And businesses like Facebook, Google, Deloitte, PwC and Cisco have built Qi into their corporate offices.\n\n\"Over the last few years, one of the major delays for [manufacturers] wanting to introduce wireless charging solutions, particularly in the automotive in-cabin market, is the wait to discover which standard Apple may choose for any wireless-charging-enabled iPhone,\" said Vicky Yussuff, IHS lead analyst for wireless power. \"Now that Apple has decided to use the Qi standard, transmitter shipments into the in-cabin market will likely surge.\"\n\nAlong with third-party wireless charging manufacturers, Apple also plans to release its own AirPower wireless charging station designed to charge up to three Apple products at once, including the iPhone devices, Apple Watch and Apple AirPods through the charging case.\n\nThe number of devices enabled with wireless charging exceeded 200 million units a year for the first time in 2016, according to the latest IHS Markit forecast. Driven by shipments in mobile phones and wearables, that represented a 40% increase over 2015 levels as more consumers experience wireless charging for the first time.\n\nThe 2016 IHS Markit consumer survey showed that one in four people has now used wireless charging, and more than 98% of those would choose the feature again on their next phone. Both consumer demand for the feature and the volume of enabled devices are growing each year.\n\n\"Samsung's success with implementing wireless charging over the last two years coupled with Apple's iPhone announcement this week demonstrates that wireless charging technology is clearly achieving mainstream adoption in the mobile phone market, and the scope of its application is expected to quickly follow suit in other applications,\" Yussuff stated in a recent industry report.\n\nFor several years, restaurants, coffee shops and airports have been piloting the use of wireless charging for customer convenience.\n\nWith wireless charging adoption becoming widespread, the impulse for many users will be to just plop their smartphones down on the charging pad where it will remain fully charged all day long.\n\nIs it bad to fully charge your smartphone?\n\nWith greater ease of charging via wireless technology, the question becomes: Is it bad for your mobile device battery to be fully charged all the time?\n\nVenkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS), said that while you cannot overcharge a smartphone or tablet battery, as the electronics will not allow it, keeping it fully charged will hasten its degradation.\n\n\"Frankly, the higher you are in the [charge] state, as you creep up to 90%, 95% to 100% charge, the more degradation the battery will see,\" he said.\n\nAs a lithium-ion battery charges and discharges, ions pass back and forth between a positive electrode (made of lithium-cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate) and a negative electrode (made of carbon graphite).\n\nAs a battery charges, the positive electrode gives off lithium ions that move to the negative electrode and are stored as energy. As the battery discharges, those ions move back to the positive electrode to be used as electricity. As those lithium ions move back and forth, the electrolyte that acts as the transport medium degrades over time.\n\nThe higher the state of charge, the faster the electrolyte degrades, Srinivasan said.\n\nTherefore, it's best not only to keep your smartphone below its top charge, but also to keep the charging and discharging pendulum from swinging wildly.\n\n\"In general, if you swing the battery charge from top to bottom, that's the worst thing you can to for the life of the battery. If you can cycle the battery between 45% and 55% that's the best thing you can do,\" Srinivasan said. \"But, in general, just make sure you don't keep it fully charged.\"\n\nSrinivasan also cautions against being too sensitive to your smartphone or tablet charging. Most smartphone manufacturers design batteries to last two to three years, so if you're a consumer who typically replaces your phone after that amount of time, you don't need to be overly concerned with charging rates.\n\nAs more lithium-ion batteries hit the market, in both consumer electronics and electric vehicles, the rhetoric over whether you should keep those batteries fully charged has heated up, Srinivasan said. His blog posts often receive long comment threads from both sides of the spectrum.\n\n\"The debate between degradation due to high voltage hold vs. degradation due to over-cycling/over-discharge is a hot one,\" Daniel Steingart, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, stated in a recent blog post.\n\nLeaving your smartphone or tablet fully charged will speed the degradation of the battery, he said. But, he added, it's not that simple.\n\nThe damage of fully charging your battery has lessened over time with more sophisticated mobile battery management systems and incremental improvements in the battery cell technology itself, he said. For example, in 2007, when Steingart was a graduate student, taking a battery cell repeatedly to 4.2 volts meant \"an early death\" for it. he said. Today, the same damage to modern battery cells would require at least 4.4 volts.\n\nEven though battery cell technology has improved, there are still too many industry variables to know definitively whether one battery will show greater endurance than another based on continuous charging.\n\n\"We simply don't know, without a complicated tear-down and reverse engineering of the battery and battery management system, what the actual state of charge when the phone says '100%' is,\" Steingart said. \"Some apps give voltage indication, yes, but without knowing the specific formulation and composition of the cathode, we don't know exactly.\"\n\nBMS systems stop a smartphone or tablet from continually charging through the use of a sophisticated algorithm that balances how long the phone will last today vs. how long the battery will last, according to Steingart. If not for BMS technology, constantly charging your phone would kill the battery after a few months, he said.\n\nSteingart argued that the convenience of having a fully charged phone outweighs the risk of long-term battery damage. \"It's generally pretty straightforward to change a battery in a phone or have someone do it for you for [about] $20,\" he said. \"An extra $20 for a few years of convenience? Sign me up.\"\n\nApple charges a bit more for a battery replacement; regardless of the model you own, it's $79. If you have an AppleCare extended warranty, then it's free.\n\n\"Yes, a cell phone is an investment,\" Steingart said, \"but relative to the incremental cost of a new battery, there are much, much more important things to worry about in the world.\"", "When BMW finally gets around to unveiling the i8 Roadster at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show this December, it's also expected to announce significant upgrades for the current car.\n\nAccording to BMW Blog, the i8 Roadster will allegedly pack twice the capacity of the i8 coupe. The current car clocks 14.2 mpg using a turbocharged three-cylinder and 7.1-kWh battery pack.

He put his clubs down to try and coax the scrappy-looking dog out of the bog and thickets surrounding the 5th hole.\n\nShe was too afraid and hid. But that gesture started the quick, serendipitous search that reunited me with my missing pooch.\n\nI had been posting fliers and walking streets for two days! Chrissie, a 3-year-old Tibetan Terrier, had charged past her wonderful dog sitters - Bill and Pam Russell - after a week of my being gone for 10-hour days preparing for and performing in the show The Men and Their Music at the Apollo theatre in Lincoln Park. I think she was trying to find me. I was up all night for two nights making fliers and posting them around the area, and leaving info on Facebook and doing everything I could think of to find her. The Russells never stopped driving around and calling her name. Tim Sheil brought his black lab, Gracie, up from the city to try and track her. We were were all heart sick!\n\nOn Monday, September 11, while home from canvassing nearby neighborhoods and getting ready to walk out the door, I realized I'd left my phone in the charger. I ran to get it and it started to ring, the voice on the other end said \"Kathy-my name is Mary. I just left Conway Farms, my husband, John, is playing in the Pro Am and mentioned to me that he had spotted a dog on the course. When I told this to Todd Marsh, the general manager of Conway Farms Golf Course, he immediately had me show him the area where the dog was spotted -- but we didn't see her. I just happened to stop by the Starbucks on Waukegan Road and saw your flier. She doesn't look like the dog that my husband described, who was scraggly and dirty, but I just thought I would call you anyway. You live miles away but you never know! Call Todd Marsh, he's a dog-lover, and hurry!\"\n\nI grabbed a flier, the leash and tore out the door. Of course Conway was buzzing with police, golf pros, TV towers. Security let me through after showing them the flier of Chrissie. After scouring the area with Elijah - who was with outdoor operations, and driving a cart to the 5th, 6th, and 7th holes while asking lawn workers and TV camera people if they had seen a dog, he dropped me at the clubhouse to find Todd. I didn't want to bother him with everything thing that was going on inside but asked his assistant if he was available for a minute to talk to me.\n\nWithin a minute Todd came thru the door \"get in the cart - let's go!\" We flew down the asphalt trail to the furthest hole from the clubhouse.\"This is where John saw her,\" he said. \"I can't stay but let me know how it works out.\" I asked him what to do regarding calling her name; does golf protocol allow me to raise my voice? Todd said with a smile \"do whatever is necessary!\"\n\nSo I walked along the thickets of trees, three-foot high grasses and bogs surrounding the 5th hole, calling \"Chrissie! Chrissie!\" and hoping I wouldn't keep someone from shooting par on the green! I couldn't imagine how afraid a dog would be to be lost in the area. After 20 minutes or so, as I stood looking out at the endless acres and wondering how in the world she would ever hear me, when suddenly I heard a crackle and out Chrissie bounced through the air, landing at my feet. A dog's natural GPS is amazing!\n\nShe cried. I cried. The golfers putting on the green thankfully said nothing! I couldn't carry her because of all the burrs digging in to her skin. But she was alive and well and very thirsty!\n\nI contacted everyone immediately and we all were just joyous that she had been found! After I calmed down a little bit, I realized what a miracle it all was. John, just happening to see her that split second in the rough. Mary mentioning it to Todd and going to the Starbucks where I had posted a flier. Mary tearing my number off the bottom of the page and calling me.\n\nThe fact that I was home when the phone rang. That Todd was able to help and took the time to break away from all that was going on inside the clubhouse on such a busy afternoon! That Chrissie had heard me through the acres of thick, dark woods and was able to follow my voice to the exact place where I stood!\n\nI am so humbled at the kind and generous actions of total strangers. I'm not a member of Conway Farms Golf Club. Nor do I live there. John was playing to honor the Evans Scholars who had so kindly extended a scholarship to him, which allowed him to go to college. Mary called \"just in case\". Todd, who was swarmed by all the activities surrounding the tournament, took the time to escort me around the course. The Russells tirelessly helped me search to find Chrissie.\n\nThen I remembered that it was 9/11. The kindness and goodness of total strangers, who reached out in love to help an innocent little creature renewed my faith in humanity!

It's a very flawed but very likable car, one that is still capable of putting smiles on faces. But, let's face it, it's time for the E89 Z4 to be put down. Out with the old, in with the new. Taking its place will be the upcoming G29-gen BMW Z4 and it should be a better car. It's built on a new, better chassis, has better engines and will be significantly lighter, thanks to the new car ditching the heavy folding metal roof for a more traditional soft-top. So, naturally, we're excited about the upcoming Z4. Some spy photos have recently surfaced that give us another glimpse at the newest Bavarian roadster and we get to see some production-ready headlights (we don't own the spy photos, but they can be seen here).\n\nWhile you might be thinking, \"Nico, why should we care about spy photos that show us almost the same thing we've been seeing for a year?\", I implore you to go and check them out so you can spot something interesting, as the headlights have seemingly changed from the other Z4 pre-production cars we've seen before. Typically, BMW headlights have always featured some version of a two-circle, horizontal design. Recently, they've become more angular but the idea remains. However, this new BMW Z4 seems to have a slightly different take, one from a very interesting concept.\n\nLooking at the headlights in the spy photos, we can only see the bottom portion of them, as the top is still covered in camouflage. In that bottom portion, there is only one \"circle\" and not two. At first, you might think BMW may have ditched the two-circle design and just gone with one. Until you look at the BMW Z4 Concept and realize that it has similar headlights and the two \"circles\" are actually vertical and not horizontal. So the new BMW Z4 will have the same sort headlights from the stunning Z4 Concept.\n\nThis is a very encouraging sign, as the new BMW Z4 Concept is possibly the prettiest from the Bavarians in a very long time. We can't wait to see the new BMW Z4 Roadster uncovered and on the road. We're even more impatient to drive it. [Source:", "To entrepreneur Elon Musk, building Tesla electric vehicles is about creating \"one of the great companies of the 21st century,\" one that is \"fair and just ... the only kind worth creating.\"\n\nTo the United Auto Workers, which is trying to unionize Tesla's Fremont factory, building Tesla cars is about doing so at substandard wages and in dangerous conditions, accompanied by efforts to suppress the unionization campaign.\n\nThen there are California legislators and Gov. Brown, who enacted legislation earlier this month threatening to withhold rebates on electric vehicles unless their manufacturers can be certified \"as being fair and responsible in the treatment of their workers.\"\n\nThat could be a considerable threat, since Tesla customers this year have been collecting almost $1 million a month from the state in rebates on the automaker's luxury Models S and X, at a rate of $2,500 per car. The claims are certain to rise in coming years as Tesla ramps up production of its mass-market Model 3, which just began coming off the assembly line.\n\nThe new law has stirred editorialists across the state, who have come down heavily on Tesla's side. \"Outrageous groveling to unions,\" groused the San Jose Mercury; \"a thinly veiled threat against an employer of thousands of Californians\" was the description offered by the San Francisco Chronicle. (These clips were brought to my attention by Tesla, as an indication of its opinion of the legislation.) The Times editorial board hasn't spoken on the issue.\n\nThe legislation applies not only to Tesla, which is aiming to mass-manufacture cars in California, but to all automakers whose vehicles are eligible for state rebates. That includes Nissan, Toyota, GM, Ford, BMW and lesser-known companies such as Bluecar and BYD.\n\nThe rebate program has been a boon for the electric carmakers, whose customers have collected nearly $449 million in state rebates since the program began in March 2010. About $140 million has been appropriated in the current fiscal year for the rebates, which are entirely funded from cap-and-trade program revenues; an allocation for the next fiscal year hasn't yet been made. Significantly fewer rebates have been doled out his year -- $60.3 million through Sept. 28, compared with $71 million in the same period in 2016 -- but that's mostly because the state imposed income limits in mid-2016 so the rebates wouldn't go strictly to wealthy buyers. That may have hurt Tesla, a luxury brand that accounted for more than 21% of all rebate dollars last year, but only about 12.4% so far in 2017.\n\nStill, it appears that the state's shot was aimed chiefly at Tesla. The language was inspired by the California Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the UAW, which in turn is engaged in a ferocious unionization battle with Musk and Tesla.\n\n\"The big picture for us is that the auto manufacturing industry created at least two generations of middle-class families,\" Angie Wei, chief of staff of the labor federation, told me. \"Now, not only are we replacing combustion-engine cars, but we're incentivizing it with public money. The question is whether that's going to duplicate the middle-class life that was created for so many families.\"\n\nThe unions say that won't happen at the wage rates and working conditions typical in the electric vehicle industry. Tesla's own figures put average annual hourly pay for Fremont workers who started in January 2013 at about $39,000, or a bit less than $19 an hour. \"No one can survive in California on that,\" says Wei, \"especially in the Bay Area.\" The corresponding hourly wage at General Motors, by Tesla's reckoning, is nearly $24.\n\nMusk acknowledged in an email to Tesla employees that cash compensation at Tesla, healthcare and other benefits have run well behind those of GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. He argued that the difference was more than balanced by Tesla workers' access to stock grants. By their nature, however, the value of those grants is conditional -- as J.P. Morgan once said, stocks \"fluctuate.\" Unless Tesla is guaranteeing its shares' value to employees, stock grants aren't the equivalent of hourly cash pay. It's true that over the last four years, the shares have gained nearly 90%, but there have been periods in that span when it's taken a tumble, too.\n\nWorkers who moved to Tesla from NUMMI, the joint Toyota-GM automaker that built the Fremont plant before shutting down in 2010, may feel the pinch especially acutely. Tesla production worker Hai Nguyen, 38, says he earned $32 an hour at NUMMI, where he worked for nine years. Now he collects $18 an hour at Tesla, where he's been employed for just over four and a half years performing roughly similar work. He says he received options on 60 shares of Tesla stock when he joined, but had to sell them to make ends meet when they vested four years later. Subsequent option bonuses, he says, are at the discretion of supervisors. Nguyen is involved in the UAW organizing campaign.\n\nTesla has mounted an aggressive anti-labor campaign that has resulted in a formal accusation of unfair labor practices lodged in August by the National Labor Relations Board. A hearing is scheduled to begin in Oakland on Nov. 14. Among the allegations is that Tesla supervisors and security guards have improperly interfered with union leafletting.\n\nThe NLRB also indicated it regards the confidentiality agreement employees are required to sign as overly restrictive. The agreement states that \"everything you work on, learn about or observe in your work about Tesla is confidential,\" including information about other employees, and warns that \"it is never OK to communicate with the media or someone closely related to te media about Tesla\" without permission. The board has regarded some such agreements as violations of federal labor law, and it's prevailed in federal court. Tesla called the NLRB filing \"baseless\" and \"entirely without merit.\"\n\nMusk's own comments about the union drive also have a retrograde tone, not unlike what one might hear from an industrial magnate in the 1890s. Following a post on Medium.com about injuries and poor pay by Tesla worker Jose Moran, Musk accused Moran of being a paid union agitator and painted the UAW as an organization that \"does not share our mission and whose true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.\" The company says it's working to make Fremont \"the safest car factory in the world\" and that its safety record is \"much better than [the] industry average.\"\n\nSome workers question that. Nguyen says the safety culture at Tesla doesn't match NUMMI's, where he says equipment was better maintained and work routines more standardized. \"They don't take safety ss seriously as they say they do,\" he told me. Workers often are loath to complain, because \"there's no job security.\"\n\nThat brings us back to the state's initiative on electric vehicle manufacturers' labor relations. It's unclear how much Tesla or any other companies have to fear from the legislation, which Gov. Brown signed on Sept. 16. The measure expresses the legislature's \"intent\" that the secretary of Labor work with the Air Resources Board to \"develop procedures\" to certify the automakers as \"fair and responsible\" in time for the 2018-2019 rebate year. Labor Secretary David Lanier will start working on that process with \"stakeholders\" -- including organized labor and the manufacturers -- in coming months, according to his spokesman. Prospective buyers, who are the direct beneficiaries of the rebates, also can be expected to weigh in.\n\nThe process, in other words, is wide open. \"We're all trying to figure out how this will play out,\" says Chuck Colgan, a spokesman for the Center for Sustainable Energy, a nonprofit that runs the rebate program for the state.\n\nThe factors likely to be used to judge a company's employee relations are easy to guess, if not the weight they'll carry. Unresolved NLRB suits or a surfeit of OSHA complaints: bad. Competitive wage rates: good. The rules worked out by the Labor secretary and ARB will probably have to be approved by the legislature, so the industry's lobbying clout also will be stirred into the cauldron.\n\nBut encouraging good labor relations hasn't always been easy for government agencies, especially in recent years when corporate profits have soared and wages have stagnated. Critics of the \"fair and responsible\" rule should explain why it's wrong for California to hold manufacturers using millions of dollars in public funds to pump up their sales to broad standards of behavior. \"We want to make sure,\" Wei says, \"that the public investment California is making creates both cleaner air and good jobs for our economy.\"\n\nKeep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

Yet, still, one of my favorite technologies in modern cars' options list is semi-automatic parking assist. The smartest of today's cars can basically park themselves at the touch of a button.\n\nIn addition to just making life easier for lazy automotive journalists, parking assist systems make parking faster, more accurate and safer for everyone. However, these systems come at many different levels of sophistication and not all are created equally. To make your life easier, I've put together a guide to the different types of parking assistance tech and what we look for when deciding on our favorites.\n\nPassive parking tech\n\nAt the most basic level, parking assist technology is any device or feature that boosts the convenience and safety of parking your car. This could include passive systems like the rear camera that boosts visibility when reversing or the guidance lines on the camera's feed that help to plot a course around obstructions.\n\nEven more useful are proximity or parking-distance sensors that silently scan the area around the car and notify the driver when approaching an obstruction. These systems are especially useful because their audible alerts don't require the driver's full visual attention, you can keep looking around. However, the inclusion of a visual indicator on the dashboard (like those on BMW or Audi's parking distance sensors) further boosts the ease of squeezing into very tight spots.\n\nMost proximity detection systems use ultrasonic sensors that can double as rear cross-traffic alert systems that detect oncoming vehicles when reversing out of a parking spot or even for blind spot monitoring on the highway. The most advanced of these features can even automatically apply the brakes when the sensors detect you're about to back into a wall or pedestrian or move into the path of a collision. I'm not a huge fan of auto-braking as false-positives can be jarring, but for inexperienced or inattentive drivers it's better to be safe and mildly annoyed than sorry.\n\nWhat you want to look for is a system that gives you a lot of information about the area around your car without returning a lot of false positives. Generally, sonar is better than camera-based at avoiding hitting objects, especially at night or in the rain when camera visibility suffers, but cameras are better at avoiding curbs, which ultrasonic sensors usually miss. If possible, get both: I like the BMW Park Distance Control's sort of proximity heat map that works well with its 360-degree camera system. I also like Audi's Parking System Plus for its ability to customize the volume and tone of the audible distance alerts, which some may find annoying.\n\nActive parking tech\n\nThose same ultrasonic sensors are part of the requirement for the current cutting-edge of active parking technology: semi-autonomous parking or, as it's sometime known, parking with steering assist. As the name would indicate, these technologies feature computer aided steering, so the other requirement would be an electric power steering system (EPS).\n\nHere's how it most often works. When the active parking system is activated, ultrasonic sensors at the front and rear corners of the car activate to scan the roadside, detecting parked vehicles and the spaces between them and measuring those spaces.\n\nBy default, most systems scan the passenger side of the car where you're most likely to be parallel parking, but you can specify the direction of scanning by using the appropriate turn signal. You can also usually choose between parallel parking on the street and perpendicular parking in a parking lot on newer cars. The method differs from make to make, but most often it's toggled by tapping the parking assist button.\n\nOnce the car passes a space where the car will fit with a reasonable margin, it will alert you to first stop and shift into reverse. At this point, you should have a look and make sure that the spot is clear and legal. Current parking systems can't see driveways, fire hydrants, no parking signs or red-painted curbs, so if the space isn't legit keep on moving and the system will keep scanning.\n\nIf the space is legit, let go of the steering wheel and the car's computers will take over the electric power steering, turning the wheel for you and guiding the vehicle into the space. You, the human in the seat, retain control of the pedals and will need to ease off of the brakes in order for the car to move. The system may also call upon you to shift between drive and reverse gears, if corrections are needed for perfect parking.\n\nAt any point, you can grab the steering wheel to cancel the steering assistance and immediately regain control of the car, which is why it's important to actually let go of the wheel during auto-parking -- if the car feels your hand on the wheel, it may (and probably will) cancel the assistance, leaving you to complete the maneuver yourself.\n\nAnd since semi-auto parking can get cars into really tight spots -- or perhaps the cars around you have changed position while you were away -- the best systems will also feature an inverse feature called park-out assist. This feature will take control of the steering wheel while the driver shifts between forward and reverse, shuffling the car out of close quarters. Once the path is clear, the system will disable assist and leave you free to go.\n\nI find that letting the computer do the parking is helpful in a variety of ways even for experienced drivers. For starters, it's often faster, more precise and certainly more convenient. The ability to automatically measure potential parking spaces alone makes semi-autonomous parking assist worth the cost of admission for larger vehicles and SUVs. It also totally removes the learning curve for unfamiliar vehicles and drivers, so you can lend your car to a family member and not have to worry about it returning with curbed wheels or dinged bumpers.\n\nWhat you want to look for is simplicity of operation. Auto-parking systems have been around since 1999, but they were complicated and it wasn't until 2009 that we started seeing systems with the holy grail of single-button operation. Look for one of those single button systems like Ford/Lincoln's Active Park Assist, FCA's ParkSense, Volkswagen's Park Assist or Toyota's Intelligent Park Assist. Many automakers also call their proximity sensors \"park assist\" as well, so make sure you're getting the one that steers. While you're at it, double check that your make and model also supports some sort of park-out assist to get you out of tight spots.\n\nRemote parking tech\n\nSo far, the common thread of all parking tech is that a human actually needs to be in the driver's seat while parking the car. However, that may not always be the case with the cutting edge of parking technology: remote parking.\n\nRemote parking systems let drivers get out of the car and send their car to a parking space or summon it when it's time to drive. This could be as short a distance as a few feet to send the car into a tight space where the doors would be blocked for entering or exiting or as far as summoning the car from a remote garage on your property to pick you up at the front door. At this high level of tech, there are three tiers of functionality.\n\nThe first is basically remote control. You line the car up with the space, get out and hold a button on the key fob or smartphone app to send the car into the space. Take your finger off of the button and the car stops moving. On the surface, it's fairly simple.\n\nTesla's Autopilot Summon feature on the Model S and Model X are examples of this remote technology, as are BMW's Remote Parking feature on the latest 5 and 7 Series sedans. I should note that remote parking of any sort is not yet street legal in the U.S., so you'll be limited to using the technology on your own personal property, which is why Mercedes-Benz doesn't offer the functionality on its North American models.\n\nTech tier two is what's called trained parking, which I've seen demonstrated by the Volkswagen Group and automotive supplier Continental. You must first \"teach\" the car a route -- say, from your garage, along your driveway and to your doorstep -- by manually driving it yourself. While being \"trained\" the car will be gathering information about the path via GPS and sensors located around its perimeter -- either cameras, ultrasonic sensors or both. With the path memorized, you can then exit the vehicle at either end of the path and send it away or call for it later via key fob or smartphone app. Each time the system runs the route, it reactivates the sensors to monitor for new obstructions, people or pets in its path and to learn more about its environment and should grow more accurate in its path-finding.\n\nThe final frontier, as it were, is truly autonomous parking. With a system like this, a driver would be able to just tell the car to go park and it would handle automatically locate a spot and get into it with no training or driver input necessary. You'd be able to drive your car to the airport at the beginning of your vacation and send it home to park in your own garage, rather than paying the pricey long-term lot rates. Likewise, a fully autonomous car would need to be able to find its way back to the driver, wherever they may be.\n\nHowever, with fully-autonomous driving still some ways down the road, it'll be some time before we see a truly self-parking car.\n\nTags Auto Tech", "Ladies and gentlemen drivers, the time has come for the supercar scene to welcome a pair of fresh main actors, namely the Ferrari 812 Superfast and the Lamborghini Aventador S. 8 photosBoth Italian exotics step forward as mid-cycle revisions for the V12 incarnations of Maranello and Sant'Agata Bolognese beasts, even though the changes delivered by the Fezza are more important.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until the two engaged in a drag race and the moment to see them being thrown at each other in a straight line has now arrived.\n\nThe two met during an event that was held on an airfield in Sweden earlier this month and if the runway that hosted their fight seems familiar, it might be because this also allowed for the iconic Porsche 911 GT1 vs. Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR battle.\n\nReturning to the Ferrari vs. Lamborgini brawl we have here, we have to explain that the two duked it out on more than just occasion, even though the piece of footage at the bottom of the page would lead you to a different conclusion.\n\nNevertheless, the description of the YouTube video comes to shed some light on the battle between the 800 hp Fezza and the 740 hp Raging Bull: \"Despite its slower start, the 812 overtook the Aventador in almost every race,\"\n\nAnd, if we look at the specs of these land-land missiles, it all becomes clear.\n\nWe'll start with the power-to-weight ratio, an area where the Maranello machine easily dominates its rival, since we're looking at 2.1 kg/hp compared to 2.5 kg/hp.\n\nThe 812 also wins the torque battle, albeit by a tiny margin (think: 718 vs. 690 Nm).\n\nInterestingly, despite the Aventador S packing all-wheel-drive, the rear-wheel-drive 812 Superfast ties the Lamborghini in terms of the 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) sprint, with both requiring at least 2.9 seconds to complete the task.\n\nAs far as the aural part of the battle is concerned, we're asking you to decide which one is the winner.\n\nFerrari 812 Superfast lamborghini aventador s drag racing Lamborghini Ferrari supercar V12 German Combustion Engines Have Six Years To Walk The Plank 10 Ways to Make More Money Selling Used Cars Production Cars with the Highest Torque Numbers For 2017 Shell Angry at Bans on Fossil Fuel-Burning Cars Because of Course They Are BMW TwinPower Turbo Engines Explained From Wrecks and Rust to Riches: A Story of Passion and Business An Ode to Embracing the Metric System A Simple Guide to the G80 Locking Differential Project CARS 2 - Everything You Need To Know Who is Still With The \"Save The Manuals\" Crowd?

Technavio presents a detailed picture of the market by way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources.\n\nThe automotive industry is the key end-user in the thermoplastic polyolefins market. The roofing segment in the construction industry is the second largest end-user in the thermoplastic polyolefins market. Stringent regulations associated with the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) roofing have increased the demand for TPO roofing. The thermoplastic polyolefins are used in other applications such as wire and cable, packaging, and plastic repair. The market has immense potential for technological innovations.\n\nThis report is available at a USD 1,000 discount for a limited time only: View market snapshot before purchasing\n\nBuy 1 Technavio report and get the second for 50% off. Buy 2 Technavio reports and get the third for free.\n\nTechnavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global thermoplastic polyolefins market:\n\nPreference for TPOs over PVC Rising demand in the roofing industry Increasing demand for TPO in North America and APAC\n\nLooking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report\n\nTechnavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.\n\nPreference for TPOs over PVC\n\nSeveral regulations have been formulated on the use of PVC as it contains vinyl chloride monomer that is known to be a human carcinogen. Regulatory bodies restrict the use of PVC in toys and baby products. Several medical and nursing associations have highlighted the health risks associated with the use of PVC medical devices.\n\nMohd Shakeel Iqbal, a lead plastics, polymers, and elastomers research analyst at Technavio, says, \"The EPA directly amended the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for polyvinyl chloride and copolymers production area sources. This rule withdrew total non-vinyl chloride organic hazardous air pollutant process wastewater emission standards for new and existing PVC and copolymers area sources. This rule came into effect on March 30, 2015.\"\n\nRising demand in the roofing industry\n\nGrowth in the roofing industry drives the demand for thermoplastic polyolefins. Increasing number of constructions drives the demand for roofing systems. Construction activities are increasing at a rapid pace, especially in the developing regions. The ever-growing population and varying weather conditions have led to the emergence of various types of roofing. There are various types of roofings for residential and commercial purposes. Roofs are also broadly classified into flat roofs and pitched roofs.\n\n\"Single ply roofs have been in use for the last 20-30 years and are popular due to their several advantages such as flexibility, easy installation, and affordability. The single ply roof can be categorized into thermosets and thermoplastics. The five key types of single ply roofing are PVC, EPDM, TPO, thermoplastic elastomer, and polyisobutylene. Out of these, PIB is the oldest, while TPO and TPE are the recent ones,\" adds Shakeel.\n\nIncreasing demand for TPO in North America and APAC\n\nIn 2016, North America and APAC accounted for 69% of the total revenue generated by the global thermoplastic polyolefin market. The growth of thermoplastic polyolefins market in these regions is primarily attributed to the rising demand for TPO in the automotive sectors. APAC is an emerging market that draws investments from large players in the automotive industry.\n\nTesla is likely to introduce its products in India. It might start might its manufacturing plant in the near future. Under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, the government of India plans to introduce around 6 million electric cars and hybrid vehicles in the country.

Hints of a supped M2 ...\n\nThere is very little doubt that BMW is preparing at least one special edition of their highly successful M2 Coupe. Hints of a supped M2 appeared last year, followed by several reports on its powertrain and more recently, hard facts based on pre-production VINs. While the most of the details seem to be known at this point, including the S55 engine implant from the M3/M4, there is one little, yet important to BMW fans, detail around the naming convention of the new sports coupe.\n\nOver the last few months we went back and forth between the M2 CS and M2 Competition badge, but today, we can say with certainty that BMW will sell the revamped sports coupe under the M2 Competition nameplate.\n\nDespite seeing several prototypes out for testing, BMW plans to unveil the M2 Competition in late 2018 with a market launch scheduled for early 2019.\n\nUnder the hood it will feature the 3.0-liter S55 petrol engine from the M3/M4 with a maximum power of 405 hp. The engine will be mated to a 7-speed M-DCT transmission or a six-speed manual.\n\nAlong with the power increase, the supped up M2 will also introduce new colors to the lineup. One of them is Silver Hockenheim, while the other is a flashier one - Sunset Orange. The M2 CS will continue to be offered in Alpine White, Black Sapphire, Mineral Grey and Long Beach Blue Metallic.\n\nThe M2 Competition will surely go up in price, with premiums expected anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 over the price of the \"regular\" M2.", "Before the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio first debuted, it had already made headlines with a record-breaking Nurburgring lap time. The Giulia Quadrifoglio had broken the all-time production sedan lap record at the 'Ring, a record it still holds. It was incredibly impressive then and still is so now. It seems, though, as the Italians aren't content on leaving just their Giulia with a Nurburgring record. Now, it's the turn of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, the brand's hot SUV.\n\nThe Stelvio Quadrifoglio has just broken the all-time production SUV Nurburgring lap record, with a blistering time of 7:51.7. While a sub-eight minuted 'Ring time isn't all that impressive for a genuine sports car, it is for an SUV. The Stelvio is about the size and weight of the new BMW X3, so imagine a car of that size putting down genuine sports car times on the most difficult race track in the world. That's fast.\n\nUnder the hood of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio lies the same 2.9 liter twin-turbocharged V6 that powers the go-fast Giulia. So it makes 505 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque. All of that fury is sent through an eight-speed automatic to all four wheels. Alfa claims a 0-60 mph time of around 3.9 seconds. That's about the same as the Giulia Quadrifoglio, which is probably about right. While the Giulia is lighter, the Stelvio has all-wheel drive traction to make the most of its power. So it's no surprise that it's quick, it's surprising just how quick.\n\nThere's a video of the timed lap, of course, so as to prove the Stelvio really did it. It's impressive to see how well the Stelvio Quadrifoglio seems to handle. Turn-in is sharp and its chassis seems very agile. Admittedly, it is on the same chassis as the Giulia, so we know it's good. Although, we don't know what sort of tires and/or brakes this specific Stelvio had. We imagine that Alfa used a stock variant of the car but Italian companies have been known to lie a bit with tires and brakes (we're looking at you, Ferrari and Pagani). Still, it's an impressive lap time and makes the upcoming BMW X3 M a very important car for BMW.", "For the past few years, BMW enthusiasts have been wondering if the brand's newfound goal to reach a broader spectrum of customers has robbed it ...\n\nFor the past few years, BMW enthusiasts have been wondering if the brand's newfound goal to reach a broader spectrum of customers has robbed it of the driving dynamics it was once known for. It's not an uncommon question, nor an unfounded one, as BMW's have become increasingly soft as of late, eschewing the brand's typical \"Ultimate Driving Machine\" ethos for more comfort, more tech and more luxury. If you're one of the enthusiasts who believes this notion to be true, you won't like Motor Trend's new BMW 530i long-term update.\n\nThe BMW 5 Series is one of the biggest culprits of the brand's new direction. Ever since the E39-generation, the 5 Series has gotten bigger, more complicated, far more technological and more luxury-oriented. While we will say that the new G30-gen 5er is a step in the right direction, especially after the F10-generation, it's still not perfect. Motor Trend has had a long-term BMW 530i in its fleet for some time now and feel as if it still lacks the famous BMW character we had all come to love.\n\n\"The 530i feels big and heavy and has no sense of urgency or excitement. It is hindered by dead handling and vague steering response -- not what people expect from an Ultimate Driving Machine.\" said MT's Mark Rechtin. A sentiment shared by MT's International Bureau Chief Angua MacKenszie, who said \"Has the desire to broaden BMW's appeal come at the cost of losing the dynamic purity that made the cars so desirable in the first place?\"\n\nHowever, they didn't have only bad things to say about the 5er. While it may not be the precision tool it once was, its larger, more comfortable nature makes it an excellent cruiser. \"On the plus side, once up to speed, the Bimmer bombs down the road like a budget 7 Series -- a slightly less-prestigious version, for sure, but still a very relaxed and comfortable luxury car. It absorbs road rot and expansion joints with aplomb, making for a very quiet, secure cabin at autobahn speeds.\" said Rechtin.\n\nI've spent quite a bit of time in the new BMW 5 Series and MT's sentiments aren't necessarily wrong. Though, my most recent experience in the new 5 Series was in a BMW 530i with both the M Sport package and the Dynamic Handling Package and I actually thought it was a surprisingly good handling car for its size and I really enjoyed my time with it. Yes, it's unfortunate it needs those packages to feel remotely like what a 5 Series is supposed to feel like but that's the BMW we have today. [Source:", "A \"dangerous\" hit-and-run driver who left a pensioner with serious injuries by reversing into him on a footpath has been jailed.\n\nCraig Hughes, 26, was driving around a residential area at speed in Loughton, Essex, before trying to overtake queuing traffic.\n\nWhen his route was blocked he reversed onto a footpath, knocking over the man in his 80s, before driving off.\n\nHughes was given an 18-month jail term at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday.\n\nHe admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving without a licence or insurance, failing to report a collision and failing to stop at the scene of a collision.\n\nPolice said Hughes was driving his girlfriend's white BMW 118 and had been in an altercation before the incident.\n\nHughes, of North Weald, Loughton, was also handed a 43-month driving ban and must take an extended driving test following the conclusion of the ban.\n\nPC Jenny Pirie, of the Essex Police serious collision investigation unit, said: \"Craig Hughes' actions can only be described as dangerous.\n\n\"He was driving aggressively, with little care for other road users or pedestrians, putting their safety and his at risk.\n\n\"He left an elderly man seriously injured and then just drove off, with little regard for the victim's welfare.\"", "GT is short for the Italian term gran turismo, which, in translation, means Grand Tourer.\n\nThis automotive genre sprang, essentially, from the fast touring cars of the 1930s. The original idea was to meld performance and comfort into a harmonious whole, a car that would handle well, could drive across Europe all day at high speeds, and offer a couple a comfortable ride and room for their luggage.\n\nThese cars typically morphed into front-engine/rear-drive coup\u00e9s with two seats, or 2+2s with their tiny backseats. Some modern-era examples of true GTs include the Aston Martin V-8 Vantage, the Jaguar XKR, the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, the Nissan 300ZX, the BMW 6 and 8 series, the Lexus SC400, the Mitsubishi 3000GT, and the Subaru SVX.\n\nOver the years, GT became a very popular designation as automotive marketeers from Stuttgart to Detroit sought to cash in on the term's evocations of wealth, performance, and style. And so, it was perhaps inevitable that a term once associated with the likes of the legendary Mercedes Gullwing would filter down to compact, front-drive hatchbacks -- the latest being the new-for-2018 Hyundai Elantra GT that I just spent a week with.\n\nThe Elantra GT, billed as a more-fun-to-drive answer to the crossover, comes in two flavors: the standard model I drove and the higher-performing, higher-priced GT Sport. The regular GT starts at a quite affordable $20,350, and offers a generous amount of standard gear for the buck. The even better-equipped Sport, which adds sporting hardware like a turbocharged engine, retuned steering, larger brakes, higher-performing tires, and a sportier undercarriage featuring a multilink independent rear suspension, tacks about $4,000 on l'addition.\n\nThe GT is, among other things, a beneficiary of the South Korean automaker's Teutonic talent raids. Just as the GT benefits from the styling talents of former Audi chief designer Peter Schreyer, the Elantra's structural and mechanical development benefited from its supervision by the automaker's head of high-performance development, Albert Bierman, formerly in charge of BMW's performance-happy M division.\n\nOver half the steel in the new car is high strength, nearly double what was in its predecessor. That raises body rigidity, as does the extensive use of industrial adhesives and hot stamping. This added strength improves handling and helps quiet the cabin.\n\nThe test car was powered by a normally aspirated, 161-horsepower, 2-liter engine that was buttoned to a six-speed automatic gearbox. (The GT is also available with a six-speed manual.) That engine gave the GT reasonable acceleration. But like many small fours, it got a bit buzzy when flogged. Happily, it became civil enough during normal motoring.\n\nWhile the GT obviously isn't as quick and athletic as the 201-horsepower GT Sport, it is an affable companion on the road. The automatic shifts smoothly and, in sport mode, holds you in gear longer to maximize acceleration. And the GT handles with more agility than you'd expect from a car with a simple beam rear axle. Push it into a corner, and it exhibits little lean.\n\nThe GT is a handsome car, inside and out. The tester's interior proved to be clean, creative design -- and ergonomically sound. The seats, comfortable and supportive, provided a driving position as good as the car's visibility and instrument/control placement. The tester's optional leather-trimmed seats were particularly comely, featuring contrasting stitching and piping, as well as uniquely patterned, perforated inserts.\n\nThe GT has adequate rear-seat legroom for someone 6-foot-2 but not enough headroom. Storage, however, is not a problem. There is a plethora of cubbies and cup holders and nearly 25 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats. Fold them down, and you get a nearly league-leading 55.3.\n\n2018 Hyundai Elantra GT\n\nBase price: $20,350.\n\nAs tested: $27,460.\n\nStandard equipment: 2-liter engine, six-speed automatic transmission, front-drive, safety features like a driver's knee air bag and blind spot mirror and features like a user-friendly multimedia system, alloy wheels, cruise control, heated power mirrors, and a tilt/telescopic steering wheel.\n\nOptions: Some $6,000 worth of goodies ranging from blind spot detection and leather to heated and ventilated front seats and a panoramic sunroof.\n\nFuel economy: 24 mpg city and 32 highway.\n\nEngine performance: Decent.\n\nHandling: Surprisingly good.\n\nStyling: Satisfying.\n\nRide comfort: Fine.\n\nWarranty: Five years/60,000 miles bumper to bumper.\n\nThree Bens: Good\n\nPublished: September 23, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe pilot of a small plane was said to be OK after making an emergency landing Friday morning in a desert area southwest of Phoenix.\n\nSearch crews found the small aircraft in the 36000 block of south 99th Avenue at about 10:30 a.m.\n\nThe pilot of the plane, who was medically evaluated by fire crews, was not injured.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the pilot to make an emergency landing.\n\nCrews are in the area of 36000 S. 99th Ave for reported plane down.

The court heard that all four men were holding knives.\n\nHe said: \"I went to the shop to pick up food for my mother and sister.\n\n\"I had no idea that they [Abdi and his friends] were coming.\n\n\"I didn't see him coming and at first I had no idea who he was.\n\n\"But once I saw it was him [Abdi], I got a bit more relaxed because I knew who it was.\n\n\"I started asking them what they were playing at and they kept shouting and trying to get to my friend.\n\n\"I didn't think they would hurt me as they were saying his name.\"\n\nChairs were thrown by both groups before Abdi and the two men with him left the shop and ran towards Howard Road, Ilford.\n\nFollowing the incident, Mr Omar said he discussed it with his co-defendants but didn't bear any ill feeling towards Abdi.\n\nThe following night, the three defendants were driving around Ilford, delivering drugs and \"chilling\", he told the court.\n\nHe claimed that at the time of the shooting, the trio were driving to Gants Hill, in a hired white BMW, in order to sell drugs to a South Woodford resident.\n\nHe said: \"We were travelling along Woodlands Road, I was sitting in the back of the car on the passengers side.\n\n\"It looked like there was a commotion in the middle of the road with two or three people involved.\n\n\"They were arguing.\n\n\"When we got closer, we saw people running around and there were loud bangs.

You have to forego physics here - in reality, if the crossover did reach Mars, its combustion engine would need air to function. The M40i comes with a delightful turbocharged 3.0-liter engine, but turning it into a real Mars rover would start with the use of the already confirmed upcoming fully electric version.\n\nThe ad is indeed a geeky idea to promote the X3, which delivers fun thanks to the 355 horsepower and 369 pound-feet (500 Newton-meters) of torque at hand. By the way, this reminds us of the rivals from Audi - they are currently in the process of sending two Audi Lunar Quattro rovers on the Moon, after they travel the 385,000 kilometers (about 239,000 miles) in order to try and win the Google Lunar XPRIZE worth a small fortune - $30 million.", "Referring to performance cars as fighter jets is nothing new, but the advances in the wrap industry now allow owners to take this bond one step further. Let's take the 2017 Porsche Panamera we have here, for instance. 7 photosThe long-roof Porsche has been given a new identity thanks to a complex wrap job, one that uses the JAS-39 Gripen as a source of inspiration. And we have to admit that the low-key visual approach perfectly fits the Panny, adding to the understated aura any Zuffenahsuen machine is born with.\n\nNotice that the wrap is as complex as they get, with the attention to detail climbing to the sky. This isn't an accident, since the design of the second skin job comes from digital artist Scott Kepple.\n\nWe've shown you the man's creations on multiple occasions, as the pixel wielder is responsible for some the coolest wraps out there.\n\nNow, you might wonder why a Porsche owner would use the JAS-39 as a... muse. At least in this case, the reason behind the visual transformation is simple. We're talking about a Swedish Porscha, while Saab's jet fighter can be considered a symbol of the country.\n\nWe're talking about an affordable plane - the machine may not grab attention in the same way as a Eurofighter Typhoon or a Lockheed Martin F35 Joint Strike Fighter, but it certainly offers an excellent cost-to-firepower ratio.\n\nReturning to the second incarnation of the Porsche Panamera, now that plenty of owners have taken delivery of their machines, we can explain the aftermarket side of the industry to touch more and more units of the lavish sedan.\n\nFor the time being, we'll have to settle for light custom touches, such as the wrap we have here or custom wheels, but we'll certainly get to see deeper projects starting from next year.

Eleventh-hour changes include finding a beefier exhaust note and a richer sound from the stereo system to better suit American ears.\n\nThe company's initial hope was to develop a global exhaust tune, but according to Orth Hedrick, vice president of product planning at Kia Motors America, the resulting tone wasn't throaty enough for a US performance car: \"It sounded like a hissing note, like a restriction, something from the seventies.\" Hedrick told me that's in part because Europe has much tougher pass-by noise regulations, and because \"as a general rule, Korean consumers don't appreciate loud exhausts -- because they consider it [to be] a bad muffler, [that] someone's not taking care of their car. It's not refined.\" As decades of muscle cars and sports coupes readily illustrate, US buyers prefer that their performance cars offer a bit more bark to go with their bite.\n\nTo make that happen, Kia Motors America had to urge the home office in Seoul to develop a richer exhaust note, a change that involves moving baffles within the muffler to yield less restriction. The change was so important to Hedrick that the company air shipped 18 exhaust systems to be fitted to US media press preview vehicles, and the company spent a week to fit them to the cars. At the vehicle's Los Angeles media launch this week, Hedrick assured me that even the first customer cars will be fitted with the throatier hardware.\n\nTo my ears, the resulting exhaust sounds good but could still go further, and company officials know this. \"It's like 38 percent of what I would like,\" says James Bell, director of corporate communications. Bell, who was integral in pushing for a more vocal engine, notes that Kia is already seeding the car in the aftermarket with companies like Borla, a well-regarded performance exhaust company. When asked if Kia might make an even burlier Borla exhaust available through dealers, Hedrick said, \"We're looking at that... it's a lot more doable if it's after the cat[alytic converter].\"\n\nKia expects to show off a number of Stingers at the SEMA Show this fall in Las Vegas, and a Borla-tuned model will be among them. It's also likely that an even more vocal exhaust system will be factory-fitted eventually, too, but don't look for one in the Stinger's first year of production.\n\nThe same \"boomier is better\" American preference holds true for audio systems, too. As Hedrick notes, \"the Korean market has a different aesthetic for what they want to hear for sound. They don't appreciate boomy bass; that loud, full bass that we appreciate -- that kind of full resonance that fills the cabin that you can feel.\"\n\nBell, who considers himself \"a bit of a closet audiophile,\" had spent a lot of time in a preproduction Stinger and felt that despite the optional Harman Kardon audio system's comprehensive specs, the listening experience lacked low-end oomph. \"With a lot of push and a lot of shove, we were able to get them [headquarters] to reconsider it,\" says Bell. Reworking the audio system for more bass didn't require new hardware, just software, so a special EQ tuning session was held recently in Michigan to address the issue for US models.\n\nChanges to the Stinger haven't just been limited to audible matters. When the car was first revealed at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show in January, a 0-to-60 mph time of 5.1 seconds was announced for the twin-turbo V6 GT model. The production model will do it in 4.7. As Bell notes, \"It was my job to go out there and say '5.1,' and every time I said it, I was like, '5.1 -- can't we pull two-tenths of a second out of it?'\" Bell and Hedrick showed company officials back in Seoul acceleration data from other automakers who had similar vehicles, and over a summer of tuning, the engineers working on performance managed to find four-tenths. Now, the Stinger GT isn't just quicker than much-costlier cars like the base Porsche Panamera (0-60 in 5.4 seconds), it beats the BMW 440i Gran Coupe's 4.9 seconds, too.\n\n61 2018 Kia Stinger GT is a master of Germany's N\u00fcrburgring\n\nIt's totally normal for car companies to make tweaks in everything from suspension tuning to standard equipment to best align new vehicles with specific market tastes, but it is unusual for them to make substantive product changes so close to launch. Most automakers would have frozen a vehicle's exact specifications many months prior (if not an entire calendar year or more) in order to limit the potential for supplier problems and quality issues. However, Kia and its counterparts at Hyundai have developed a remarkable knack for instituting last-minute changes while still keeping suppliers happy and quality high. Honing that ability to make running changes has been a key part of both brands' success over the last decade.\n\nKia may be new to the higher-dollar, higher-performance end of the market where the Stinger will live, but it also seems to recognize that continual updates are particularly important to this type of vehicle, both to stay ahead of competitors and simply to keep buyer interest piqued in a segment that's continually obsessed with The Next Big Thing.\n\nTo that end, special edition Stingers are planned, with the first such models expected next spring. Initially, expect things like unique exterior and upholstery colors and perhaps new wheel designs, but actual performance enhancements are likely, too. \"That's the part we're going to work on,\" says Hedrick.\n\nTo my eye, the fact that Kia is making last-minute tweaks to the Stinger GT isn't cause for worry. On the contrary, it's actually a very good sign. It not only shows that the company is sweating the details and prioritizing North American customers, it also suggests that C-suite executives in Seoul are increasingly entrusting overseas divisions with product-level decision making. Kia and corporate-cousin Hyundai have long-held reputations as autocratic operations, with a Korea-centric organizational structure that has historically declined to empower satellite divisions to control their own destiny. But this car's development suggests that top-down strategy may be changing.\n\nIn this way, the Stinger may not just end up establishing a high-performance tone for Kia's product lineup, it could well set the pace for a leaner, meaner corporate culture, too.\n\nTags Kia Performance Cars Hatchbacks Sedans Kia", "BMW Belux launches 5 special BMW i8 cars this year in mythical BMW colors.

The need of the hour, according to him, are electric vehicles that are less polluting and more energy-efficient than cars running on conventional fossil fuels.\n\nDuring an interview with Forbes India, the minister also raised concerns about self-driving cars taking over the jobs of cab drivers in the country.\n\nIdentifying manpower as one of India's biggest strengths, Gadkari added, \"We need technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, and electronics. But, at the same time, we have to protect the employment of the country's youth.\"\n\nDriver shortage is a major problem in rural and tribal areas. According to a 2016 report by financial services firm Avendus, the acute scarcity of skilled drivers could hit 50% by 2020. The problem has, in turn, stunted the growth of a number of sectors that rely on the trucking industry for transportation of goods and raw materials, such as agriculture and construction, among others.\n\nAs stated by Nitin Gadkari, there is a shortage of more than 2.2 Mn drivers in India at present. While the integration of technology and innovation are essential for the country's growth, the government also has to consider the impact automation could have on the country's socio-economic conditions before implementing it, the minister stated.\n\nUnlike developed countries that have to resort to technology because of the shortage of manpower, India boasts a vast reserve of human resources and cheap manpower. To that end, the Transport Ministry is looking to open driver training centres across the country. The move, Gadkari added, is aimed at creating jobs in this sector.\n\nAs part of the interview, the Road Transport & Highways Minister further clarified that while driverless cars are not the main focus at present, the government might consider adopting the technology as an experiment in the future.\n\nIn July 2017, Gadkari made a similar statement, wherein he said that India would likely not see self-driving cars plying on its roads in the next few years. This is because the government feels that it would result in a loss of jobs for millions of drivers in the country.\n\nHe stated at the time, \"Today, you see millions of jobs are being created in the transport market by truckers and taxi aggregators. Such technology will make millions jobless.\"\n\nAs per reports, the global self-driving car market is expected to cross $65.3 Bn by 2027. At present, the United States constitutes the largest market share at 39.08% and is poised to reach $24.04 Bn by 2027. Compared to that, the sale of electric vehicles in India has soared by 37.5% in recent years, as per a report by the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles.\n\nA couple of months back, Infosys announced that it had built India's first indigenous driverless car. The then CEO & Managing Director of Infosys, Vishal Sikka showcased the futuristic driverless cart a media briefing by the company in July.\n\nCurrently, the market is dominated by big players like Mercedes-Benz, General Motors, BMW, Toyota, and Tesla. In recent years, Internet-based companies Google and Uber have also forayed into the realm of driverless vehicles, Google with Waymo and Uber with Uber ATG. In India, Tata Elxsi, the Tata Group's design and technology firm, has been working on self-driving cars.\n\nWith the government focussing more on turning India into a 100% electric vehicles by 2030, the fate of driverless cars in the country, as stated by Nitin Gadkari, remains uncertain.", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe driver of a BMW convertible was carjacked at gunpoint Friday morning in the parking lot of a Starbucks in Scottsdale.\n\nHe had just pulled into the lot at 9301 E.

Across the U.S. and Europe, the arrival of an auto plant meant the creation of middle-class communities, with employees taking vacations, buying homes, cars, perhaps even cottages and boats.\n\nBut in Mexico -- where the auto industry has boomed under the North American Free Trade Agreement, with plants like the Audi factory that opened in Puebla state in 2016 -- the industry has created something different: a class of workers who are barely getting by, crammed into tiny 500-square-foot apartments in government-subsidized projects that they pay for over decades. Many can't afford even a used car, taking home as little as $50 per week after deductions for mortgages and cafeteria meals.\n\nWhy have Mexican auto salaries stagnated or declined while pay for Chinese auto workers rose, despite all the promises that North American Free Trade Agreement would increase Mexican wages? That's the question U.S. negotiators are asking as the third round of NAFTA talks resumes in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIronically, U.S. President Donald Trump, widely seen here as one of Mexico's worst enemies, is pressing the issue of low Mexican wage rates, saying labor protections should be strengthened.\n\n\"It's ironic, right, that he's always criticizing us, but at the same time, he could do something that benefits us, by exposing the rot in the system\" said Audi worker Eduardo Badillo, 34.\n\nThe key, in Mexico's auto industry, may be the so-called \"protection\" contracts signed long before plants open.\n\nAs in many factories in Mexico, very few of the current Audi workers ever voted for their union leader, and they won't get any chance to vote for years.\n\nGovernment records show that on Jan 24, 2014 -- almost three years before the Sept. 30, 2016, inauguration of the Audi plant -- the company signed a union contract that specified wages as low as $1.40 per hour, up to $4 per hour. The union says nobody receives the lowest wage, with most earning about $2.25.\n\nSo when the plant's 5,000 workers finally were hired two years later, they were faced with a union and a contract only a handful had voted for. Given Mexico's lack of good jobs, many do apply, including college graduates. The contract locks in wage increase of about 6 percent per year -- which outpaced inflation for a few years but now trails it -- through 2019.\n\n\"Everybody knows what the conditions are when they apply. These are the wages, this is the union,\" said union chief Alvaro Lopez Vazquez. \"You decide. If you don't like it, you can look elsewhere.\"\n\nLopez Vazquez refused to say how many people took part in the vote when he was elected in 2013; opponents say it was about two dozen. He also said he doesn't plan to call for any voting assembly or meeting until 2020.\n\n\"This is a democratic union, where the workers vote ... every six years,\" he said.\n\nLopez Vazquez and the company say the plant pays above-average wages for the sector. The company said it has paid workers bonuses and respects the union.\n\nA Nissan plant in another state pays between $2.40 and $4.75 per hour. But workers at many other plants also get vouchers to buy groceries, which Audi workers don't. Mexico's minimum wage -- which few people make -- is about 50 cents per hour.\n\nBut the real issue is choice, says former assembly-line worker Juan Carmona, 35, an assembly-line worker who says he was fired for his attempts to call for a union leadership vote. The company denies that, but wouldn't say why he was fired.\n\nMexico recently changed its constitution to demand that unions signing labor contracts have to show they have the support of the workers they represent. But there has been little to no enforcement. The Labor Department refused requests for comment.\n\nAlex Covarrubias, a labor professor at Mexico's Sonora College, said such \"protection\" contracts are almost universal in Mexico. \"Almost all the (labor) contracts that are signed in Mexico are unlawful, which means that they are company contracts, which the workers aren't aware of.\"\n\nCritics have long accused Mexican unions of doing more to control workers than represent them. The country's biggest labor federation forms part of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n\nLow wages -- along with closeness to U.S. markets -- are the key attractions that have drawn automakers such as Audi, Kia, Mazda, Toyota and BMW to open plants in Mexico over the last couple of years.\n\nLopez Vazquez, the union leader, noted that other companies pay less than Audi. In March 2016, he said, BMW signed a pre-opening labor contract for its plant that says workers can earn as little as $1.00 per hour, with a maximum of $2.30.\n\nBMW said in a statement, \"Our salary package, the mix of daily wages and benefits, is competitive and is in accordance with the region and the market.\"\n\nAs in the United States, governments have bent over backward to attract plants, offering land, infrastructure and tax breaks. The state of Puebla is even creating a new \"model city\" on greenfields near the Audi plant, though its new, largely empty apartment blocks are too expensive for most of the plant's workers.\n\nLopez Vazquez also implied that a compliant union was part of the package of attractions to get the plant in Puebla, saying, \"If we hadn't formed this union and gotten this contract, Audi might have gone somewhere else.\"\n\n\"We have a win-win philosophy. If the company does well, everybody does well,\" Lopez Vazquez said. He said the low level of wages is explained by the differences in the cost of living in Mexico. \"We couldn't make what they (U.S. autoworkers) make. We'd be millionaires.\"\n\nBadillo, the Audi worker, said he'd be satisfied making half the $34 an hour received by U.S. autoworkers.\n\nBadillo is typical of the plant's employees. He works in the paint shop, and lives with his son, Alejandro, 13, and daughter Noemi, 11, in a tiny 500 square-foot (47 square meter) government-subsidized apartment that he'll be paying off for decades.\n\nLike many of the Audi employees, he has some college education -- he started a bachelors' degree in electronics -- and he makes about $120 per week. His wife works in a department store, making less than he does. After paying their mortgage, utilities and taxes, they might have $50 per week to spend on food, entertainment and schools supplies.\n\nBadillo can't afford a car. He takes the company bus two hours to work and two hours back. Alejandro would like an Xbox video game and Noemi would like a tablet, but they know their father can't afford it.\n\nWage rates are so low now that even auto companies from China -- where average manufacturing wages rose to $3.60 per hour in 2016 -- are beginning to set up plants here.\n\nBadillo said the persistence of such low wages makes him fear for the country.\n\n\"What we don't want to see later is children assembling cellphones, but that's where we're heading,\" said Badillo. \"I don't want to see Mexico like that. I want to see Mexico make progress.\"", "Hughes only held a provisional licence and he was not insured to drive the car\n\nA man from North Weald has been jailed for 18 months for causing a crash in Loughton which left an elderly man seriously injured.\n\nCraig Hughes had driven around a residential area at speed his girlfriend's white BMW 118 before heading towards Loughton High Road on April 12, 2016 after having been in an altercation.\n\nOn Loughton High Road the 26-year-old of Norway House came across a line of stationary traffic which he tried to overtake until his route was blocked.\n\nHughes then tried to turn the car around, reversing at speed onto the footpath at which point he hit a man in his 80s and knocking him to the floor.\n\nHughes then drove off along High Road towards Church Hill and into Maplegate, leaving the victim with serious injuries.\n\nInvestigations conducted by Essex Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit revealed Hughes only held a provisional licence and he was not insured to drive the car.\n\nOn July 5, 2017 he was charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence, driving without insurance, failing to report a collision and failing to stop at the scene of a collision.\n\nHe pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday, August 25 and at the same court today Friday, September 29, he has been jailed for 18 months to serve half in prison and half on licence.\n\nHe has also received a three-year seven-month driving ban and been ordered to take an extended driving test following the conclusion of the ban.\n\nInvestigating officer Pc Jenny Pirie, of the Essex Police Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: \"Craig Hughes' actions can only be described as dangerous.

From blazing fast versions like the M760Li xDrive or the Alpina B7 Biturbo, to the fuel-efficient 730d, there's a choice for everyone out there. However, those wanting luxury while also feeling good about polluting as little as possible will most likely go for the BMW 740Le, a perfect mix between space in the back and CO2-efficient cruising.\n\nHowever, while that choice might make sense in a city like San Francisco for example, it is a bit of surprise when a citizen living in Abu Dhabi decides to go for it. Could this mean that oil sheiks are finally starting to come around and are looking at investing in clean energy? Weirder things have happened but we have a feeling that's not the case here. Why? Just check out the combination of parts thrown together on this BMW 740Le and you'll understand.\n\nFirst of all, the car was ordered with the M Sport package from the get go. That's already a peculiar choice for the 740Le which is not even close to the fastest BMW in the range. The power mix under the sheet metal comes from a measly 2-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged mill making 258 HP and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. That's combined with an electric motor delivering up to 113 HP and 184 lb-ft (250 Nm) of torque. Together, however, they deliver 326 HP and up to 500 Nm (369 lb-ft) of torque and make sure you can reach 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.5 seconds, slower than a 740d, for example.\n\nLeaving that aside though, despite the car being built with the sole purpose of offering a more eco-friendly choice to customers, this model has been decked with a 3D Design front splitter on the bottom of the bumper while round the back you might notice an Alpina spoiler on the boot lid. The changes continue with the bi-color M Performance wheels as well as the carbon fiber covers for the side mirrors from the same manufacturer. Did all that work defeat the car's purpose or could you still envision yourself behind the wheel of this car?", "BMW M cars have always been known to have some pretty interesting colors. The most iconic of BMW M colors came in the '90s and ...\n\nBMW M cars have always been known to have some pretty interesting colors. The most iconic of BMW M colors came in the '90s and early '00s, with the E36 and E46 BMW M3s, more specifically. Colors like Dakar Yellow, Techno Violet Purple and, of course, Laguna Seca Blue have all been fan favorites over the years. One such color, which happens to be incredibly rare and relatively unknown (I just learned of it today) was Byzanz Metallic, a sort of bronze metallic that came on just over 100 E36 M3s. It's a really interesting color and one that I happen to like quite a bit (I'm a fan of bronze cars, don't ask me why, I don't have a good answer). So when we see that an F80 BMW M3 has been ordered in that very same color, our interest is naturally piqued.\n\nThis specific BMW M3 was been ordered by BMW of Mamaroneck, in Mamaroneck, NY. More specifically, this is a BMW M3 Competition Package, in Byzanz Metallic with the Cloth/Leather combo interior, carbon fiber add-ons everywhere and, bless its heart, a manual gearbox.\n\nByzanz Metallic is a really great looking color, one that really stands out. It's obviously an Individual Color, as it isn't one of the BMW M3's stock colors, so it's quite expensive. The spec sheet says it cost $5,200, which isn't cheap for some paint. However, if I were buying an M3, I'd happily pay it so my car wasn't among the sea of black, white and silver M3s. BMW M cars are supposed to be in funky colors and all I see are black ones on the road. It's maddening.\n\nI also love when modern M customers get their car painted in cool M colors of the past. It shows they know their BMW history and are true fans of the brand. It's also a nice throwback to the golden years of BMW. Plus, the Bavarians were way more creative with their colors back then, so they're always the better ones. This Byzanz Metallic is a color I hadn't seen before today but now I'm glad I have. [Photos/Instagram:", "Two of the most popular BMW models in Europe are the 3 Series Touring and its larger brother, the 5 Series Touring. Both of those ...\n\nTwo of the most popular BMW models in Europe are the 3 Series Touring and its larger brother, the 5 Series Touring. Both of those models make up for a large chunk of sales in their respective families, and are made available with a wide range of motors. Even though BMW is on track to electrify nearly every model in their line-up, a report from Europe now states that the Touring models might be the exception.\n\nAt a private event in Belgium, the local BMW folks have told the eager PHEV Touring fans that those models will be skipped by BMW. The news are somewhat surprising considering the popularity of these cars and the easily transferable technology, so it remains to be seen if this strategy only applies to current generation of cars.\n\nBy 2025, the BMW Group expects electrified vehicles to account for between 15-25% of sales. To achieve that, BMW Group has developed a uniquely flexible system across its global production network. In the future, the BMW Group production system will create structures that enable our production facilities to build models with a combustion engine, plug-in hybrid or fully electric drive train at the same time.\n\nThe BMW Group currently produces electrified models at ten plants worldwide; since 2013, all the significant elements of the electric drivetrain for these vehicles come from the company's plants in Dingolfing and Landshut. Dingolfing additionally builds the plug-in hybrid versions of the BMW 5 Series and the BMW 7 Series and from 2021, it will build the BMW i NEXT. The BMW Group has invested a total of more than 100 million euros in electro-mobility at the Dingolfing site to date, with investment continuing as the BMW Group's range of electrified vehicles further expands.", "Earlier this year, many outlets, including BMWBLOG, reported, based on credible sources, that a future plug-in hybrid version of the new X3 SUV is in ...\n\nEarlier this year, many outlets, including BMWBLOG, reported, based on credible sources, that a future plug-in hybrid version of the new X3 SUV is in works. To be built under the iPerformance label, the BMW X3 xDrive30e was rumored to deliver 252 hp while the stronger X3 xDrive40e would output 326 hp. Both models were to come with a four-cylinder petrol engine and an electric motor integrated into the housing of the eight-speed automatic, as seen in the 330e, 530e and 740e.\n\nBut recent news from Europe, unconfirmed by BMW at this point, mention a hard stop on the development of the X3 plug-in hybrids and instead a shift towards the fully electric X3 SUV which is set to arrive in late 2018.\n\nThe electric-powered SUV would be relatively a straightforward X3 spin-off powered by a 225-kW motor fed by a 70-kW-hr battery that will be built in China to Chinese rules. The electric SUV will likely deliver a range above 300 miles and will feature the latest and greatest in recharging battery technology.\n\nWhile BMW aims to deliver plug-in hybrids across its entire fleet, we've already learned earlier today that some models might be excluded from this plan, which now doesn't seem to include a PHEV X3. The only SUVs with an electric drivetrain offered at the moment are the X5 xDrive40e and the China-only X1 xDrive25Le.", "The Bottom Line Caddy's ATS Coupe delivers style and world-class performance that more people really should take notice of.\n\nThe 2017 Cadillac ATS Coupe disappoints a couple of friends shortly after I take delivery for a week-long evaluation. \"Oh, it's not the ATS-V?\" they both say. No, my test car isn't General Motors' 464-horsepower performance monster, it's a base model with a turbocharged four-cylinder and an eight-speed automatic gearbox. They are unimpressed.\n\nAt first glance, writing off the ATS Coupe, as my two comrades did, may seem easy. But take a closer look at the drivetrain and you'll see that this entry-level Caddy's 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder is nothing to sneeze at. With 272 hp and 295 pound-feet of torque, the ATS outmuscles same-sized turbo mills in the Mercedes-Benz C300 Coupe (241 hp, 273 pound-feet), BMW 430i (248 hp, 258 pound-feet) and Audi A5 (252 hp, 273 pound-feet).\n\nOff the line, the ATS fires forward rapidly and with no turbo lag, delivering potent thrust all the way up to its engine's 7,000-rpm redline. The deeper tone from my tester's optional performance exhaust system adds to the experience. Shift performance from the eight-speed auto transmission is brisk, but not quite as quick and buttery as the ZF units in the Audi and BMW.\n\nNot only is the drivetrain peppy, it's fairly efficient. EPA estimates call for 22 miles per gallon in the city and 31 mpg on the highway.\n\nMost impressive of all is the ATS' handling, especially with the available V-Sport suspension that brings stiffer springs, dampers and Bridgestone Potenza RE050A summer tires to the party. Pairing the upgraded hardware with a rock-solid platform creates a coupe with superb grip and a keen sense of balance that encourages quick changes of direction.\n\nThe whole thing feels light on its feet because, well, the ATS is light compared to its trio of German rivals. At just over 3,400 pounds, the ATS weighs over 150 pounds less than BMW's 430i, while being roughly 200 pounds trimmer than Audi's A5 and Benz's C300 Coupe.\n\nHefty steering feel and respectable feedback adds to the ATS' engaging drive experience, as does a strong brake package featuring four-piston front Brembo calipers. My test car's binders have a bit more bite thanks to more aggressive pads clamping down on slotted rotors, a worthwhile option at $1,190.\n\nUnfortunately, the ATS' nimble handling does come with tradeoffs. Ride quality suffers with the low-profile performance run-flat tires and firmer suspension. You feel impacts from ruts and potholes in the cabin, and some tire noise is also noticeable.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not a fan of Cadillac's design language on its sedans. To my eye, the ATS sedan and CTS look soft and uninspiring. However, on the ATS coupe, sharper and more defined lines work, giving it a distinct appearance that helps set it apart from rounder German designs.\n\nWith the accessory V-Series rear spoiler, various black chrome trim pieces and 18-inch wheels, the ATS is without a doubt a looker, but I still prefer the appearance of the 4 Series, A5 and especially Benz's C-Class Coupe.\n\nInside the cabin, materials are of excellent quality with nice leather, stitched microfiber accents and carbon fiber trim. Front seats are comfortable and offer respectable side support to keep occupants happy. As for the backseat, that's another matter entirely -- limited head- and legroom means the second row is best for small children, if not shopping bags. In a pinch, folding up an adult or two in the back will work for short trips.", "It's not exactly facile to look past the Nurburgring production car record that was set by the 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS. However, if we do that, we can declare September the McLaren 720S month. 44 photosNow that more and more owners of the Woking missile are taking delivery of their machines, we get to talk about the British animal multiple times a week.\n\nAnd the latest occasion of the sort involves a 720S that has been taken down the aftermarket path. We're looking at a lightweight approach, one that sees the supercar getting a new skin.\n\nThe wrap we have here might not be as extrovert as some of those we've shown you over the past few years, but it still managed to make this Macca stand out from a distance.\n\nThose of you who enjoy such custom Maccas will be reminded that we talked about such a 720S earlier this week. That because an example of the twin-turbo V8 supercar was gifted with a set if custom wheels.\n\nThe rims were supplied by HRE Wheels, featuring a multi-spoke profile. Speaking of which, the uber-slim spokes of the rolling goodies allowed us to take a good look at the massive carbon-ceramic stopping hardware of the McLaren.\n\nSo far, we haven't come across any McLaren 720S example that has gone deeper down the aftermarket rabbit hole. Nevertheless, with the McLaren-targeting side of the custom car world having grown together with the automaker, it shouldn't take all that long until we get to meet such monster.\n\nAs expected, the ECU play will be the first mod to be applied to the Macca. Keep in mind that the generation change has seen the carmaker boosting its 3.8-liter motor to 4 liters.\n\nAnd since the stock car has been dynoed at 700 hp at the wheels (think: over 750 ponies at the crank), we can only imagine what tuners will do with the 720S.

Which cars would you recommend that perform well and that can accommodate three child car seats, costing \u00a323,000 to \u00a335,000? Preferably new but would consider used. We like the look of the Mazda CX-5 and Jaguar F-Pace and have also test driven a Skoda Kodiaq but are not sure if they are wide enough to fit three car seats (ours are belted ones), or whether there are others we should consider. We will definitely look into the S-Max but if I limited it to SUV's what would you recommend?\n\nSS, via email\n\nFord S-Max. That's by far the best handling car offering three full sized seats across. And you can get it with engines up to 240HP. I don't know of any with three full sized seats across that can take three child seats. I think your only option if you insist on an SUV is to get a Multimac system: https://multimac.co.uk/home/ Then you can have pretty much any SUV you want. They also do a four across version.\n\nI have a steep drive with a slight hump in the middle. I had to sell my beloved Audi TT because it grounded on the hump. I want to replace my Honda CRV (practical but boring) with something exciting so I need something with a bit more ground clearance than the Audi. I am looking at another Audi, VW or a BMW - but it has to look sporty. Budget - about \u00a314,000 and second-hand.\n\nCM, Wadhurst\n\nAudi Q3, VW Tiguan, BMW X1. These are not recommendations; merely the models of cars that fit your request. I'd add Mazda CX-3, assuming you can find one for the money. They look great and handle well too. Also a Peugeot 2008 1.2 Puretech 130 6-speed, if you can find one for the money.\n\nIn January we bought a new Suzuki Ignis Allgrip, a car you have recommended for consideration on several occasions. It is really good. Compact, but good room inside; excellent raised driving position; very nippy and very good real fuel consumption. The ride is a bit too firm, but aside from that the only disappointment is that it is not offered with All-Weather tyres. We are keen to combine the 4 wheel drive with all-weather tyres to further improve grip when the driving conditions are poor. We wanted the Michelin or Goodyear tyres, but the only all-weather ones we can find to fit the current size (175/60/16) are Falken AS200s. Are these good tyres, or are there any other alternatives we can consider. We do not want to change to Winter tyres every year.\n\nAW & CP, via email\n\nI don't know. The best way for you to find out is to check on http://www.tyrereviews.co.uk/That has the most comprehensive information and feedback of any tyres site I know.\n\nWhat all-round tyres would you recommend for my 2003 Honda Jazz. I realise we aren't obliged to buy winter tyres (yet) and I remember seeing a letter where you mentioned a couple of makes. I made a note of your answer but have mislaid it. In the past I have bought Michelin Energy Saver (175/65 R14 - maybe that's the date of manufacture). I need to replace both front tyres soon.\n\nAR, via email\n\nI recommend Michelin Cross Climate or Goodyear Vector 4 seasons. Happily you can get Cross Climates in 175/65 R14. In my opinion they need to be fitted to all four wheels. Others disagree.\n\nI wish to replace my 2001 E46 BMW 325i petrol automatic saloon with something similar in size, performance, refinement, build quality and reliability. I have narrowed my search to a new or nearly new BMW 1 series or Audi A3 saloon for a maximum budget of \u00a323,000. Any suggestions as to which model or otherwise an alternative?\n\nMP, via email\n\nI agree that the saloon is the best looking A3. But best to avoid small engine VAG automatics because they all have the potentially troublesome DQ200 7-speed dry clutch DSG/s-tronic/ 2.0 litre engines come with much more robust wet clutch DQ250 6-speed and on the Q3, Tiguan, TTRS, RS3 and latest Golf R the DQ500 wet clutch 7-speed. That leaves the 1-Series with its reliable 6-speed or 6-speed torque converter automatic.\n\nI have seen a company based in York selling cars imported from Japan that are, of course, right hand drive. Many seem to be 'classic' Mercedes 190Es, a car that I hanker after. All low miles and first class condition and claim to be easy to UK register. From your experience are there catches please?\n\nJW, via email\n\nThailand, Japan and Malaysia as well as Japan are all RHD countries. Parts of Japan are very cold and snowbound in winter. The air has quite high salt content. Though cars may still be good runners, the very tough Japanese Shaken vehicle testing regime makes many of them uneconomical to repair, so they are auctioned off for export. Cars tend to last longer before rusting out in Thailand and Malaysia. But even there they do eventually rot out. I found a 'museum' of 60s and 70s American cars in Thailand, almost all in a bad way and beyond economic restoration. So take a bit of care. Don't buy unless the car is already UK registered and has therefore passed any C of C or Enhanced Individual Type Approval. Back in the 1990s when the Tiger economies of South East Asia collapsed, thousands of RHD Mercedes for export lay rotting on the docks at Hamburg. Various traders found ways of bringing them to the UK and eventually the then MD of MDUK (a quite amazing guy), bulk bought-them to prevent them from lowering the UK used market prices.\n\nMy car is a 2013 Volvo C70 with 33,000 miles. Two days ago the drivers door window dropped and would not go up or down. I took it to the Volvo dealer from whom I bought it. He examined it and said the window mechanism had failed and needed replacing and possibly a new motor, cost around \u00a31,000. Then he informed me he did not have the spare part nor did any other Volvo dealer in the UK and in fact neither did the factory in Sweden. Anticipated delivery middle to end of September, not guaranteed. This made the car unusable as I cannot secure it if I park in a car park or on the road. Nor can I drive it with the roof down. To add to the problem I was about to go on a driving/touring holiday in Spain which will now have to be cancelled if I cannot get the car repaired which seems likely. How can a leading manufacturer run out of parts? Besides the problems for garages who cannot repair the cars, the factory will not be able to build them. All through a minor part not being available. I certainly would make one think before buying another Volvo. I also think they could not care less. All they want to do is sell their cars. Volvo used to have a good reputation for reliability and service no longer I am afraid. Any solutions please.\n\nJA, Peacehaven, East Sussex\n\nThe Volvo C70 went out of production in 2013. Underneath it's on the same platform as the 2 generation Focus, so maybe the window mechanism of a Focus II Coupe cabrio will do the job.

Auntie Betty, 90 years old, tiny at around 4 feet 10 inches, fell downstairs recently and broke her leg. I act as her carer and will be transporting her around. Normally this would be in my BMW E36 convertible. She usually manages to get into it, although with some difficulty, but I fancy access is going to be impossible in the next few months that the medics have predicted to be her recovery time. So can you recommend something with easier access, that will need to last only three or so months, and is dirt cheap. And I really mean dirt cheap. I'm not well off, Betty's not well off: we could probably run to around 500 pounds. Don't laugh.\n\nJE, via email\n\nAn old (very old) Suzuki Wagon R or Vauxhall Agila. Nice and upright. Or a Daihatsu Move (really tiny). Or a Perodua Kanari (that was based on the Move).\n\nI'm thinking about the new Honda Civic 1.0iVTEC Turbo. I used to get 41mpg from my 2015 Civic SR 1.8 iVTEC on slightly longer journeys. Tank capacity of 46 litres is quite small now in new Civics', probably too small for the new Type R. As matter of interest, the CVT on new Civic does not have Idle Stop as the manual, but I rarely use this function, it's always turned off after starting and only used occasionally to check that it is working. The Prestige has pedestrian detection at the front and if this was added at rear then we might in future have an automatic, probably a self-driving one. The only time I have driven an automatic was in the USA and I used only my right foot.\n\nTW, via email\n\nThe Real MPG average for the 2012-2016 Civic 1.8iVTEC is 41.6, but I got 48mpg from one on a long run. I have to keep campaigning over the left foot braking issue. You've got two feet. Why waste one of them while you're driving a two pedal car? Too many people think they can control automatics solely with their eight foot, which is how 80 year old Ann Diggles killed a pedestrian about 3 years ago. Then a couple of other right foot brakers came and testified in her favour and the jury let her off. People never learn. That's why we have wars.\n\nI run a 2011 Skoda Yeti 1.6TDI with 64k miles that has been faultless until recently when an injector failed. I have now been notified that VW are ready to fit the NOx emissions equipment, but I have read and heard many reports of adverse effects on performance, fuel consumption, engine noise and an increased chance of EGR valve failure following the modifications. VAG denies all this, but I wonder whether I should not just leave the engine well alone, as my local garage assure me that there would not be a problem with MoT results.\n\nJR, Nether Heyford\n\nSome Skoda owners have received a reassuring letter: \"if a customer makes a complaint to an Authorised Repairer or to the Volkswagen Group in respect of a failure of the EGR, fuel injection system or emissions after treatment system within 24 months following the date of the implementation of the technical measures, in respect of a vehicle with mileage not exceeding 160,000 miles, SKODA will consider the complaint very carefully and if such complaint was established to have arisen as a result of the implementation of the technical measures, then Skoda will act responsibly and swiftly, in line with its goodwill policy, as supplemented in the annex, to respond to the consumers' reasonable concerns.\"\n\nMy friend has taken delivery of an Audi approved 2013 RS4 avant, which, when manoeuvring at low speeds, emits a graunching noise from the rear. I suspect the diff needs an oil change. Do you agree? Further, Audi says the S-tronic box needs new fluid at 38k (not dependent on time). Do you agree? I think this should be done now, at 4-years old.\n\nJO, via email\n\nYes, I have it officially that the oil and filter change for the 7-speed longitudinal S-tronic is 4 years or 40,000 miles whichever comes first. The quattro clutch also needs an oil change. And if there is any disparity in the tyres, that could be chewing up the rear diff where the viscous coupling is.\n\nI'd like to know what is the nature of your advise on car insurance. I've been trying to solve a problem. I'm shipping a car from the USA to Sevilla, or rather Barcelona. I'd like to get it to Sevilla, where I live. I was informed that I can drive a car from the port to destination: a garage. The thing is the garage is 9 hours away, which will make this a long trip driving without insurance. Is there a company that can insure an USA car for 6 months or at least 3 until I decide to take a residency in Spain or not? I have an American drivers licence and an international one with it. I'm also Polish citizen with a Polish passport.\n\nHR, via email\n\nThere's a lot more to this than first meets the eye. If you are importing a car from the USA to Europe you will be liable for 10% European import tax, plus VAT at the rate applied in that country, plus the costs of getting it Type Approved and registered. The cost of insurance will be in addition. And you been an American citizen you would have been able to keep the car in Europe on its US plates and insurance for 6 months before you have to register it to a property in that country. But because you are an EU citizen you can't do that. You need to speak to a specialist.

I took my car to Servicing Stop for them to carry out a Service and MoT. I faced a number of issues during and after the service and MoT and these are detailed below but I want to highlight by far the most serious issue I have with them, which was that my rear calliper fell off my car whilst I was driving on holiday with my family, leaving me without any effective brakes. The Service and MoT carried out shortly before my holiday, advised me on a number of items, one of which was to replace my rear brake disc and pads, which they went ahead and replaced amongst other work identified. Two weeks later whilst driving in Devon with 4 children and 3 adults in the car - I heard a loud clunk and my brakes stopped responding. I just about managed to keep the car under control and to eventually bring it to a stop on the side of the road. My family as you can imagine were pretty shaken up by this. When I checked the car to investigate what had happened, I discovered that my rear calliper had come away from the car and was hanging by the break cable on the road. My family and I were very lucky, if we had been driving and had to brake suddenly on a motorway, the narrow country lanes of Devon and Cornwall or when going down a steep hill with a sheer drop (of which we passed many) I dread to think what might have happened - I still cannot stop thinking about it now. I called the AA and the man who came did an excellent job refitting the brake pads and calliper - he pointed out how lucky we had been. I understand the only way calliper bolts can come off is if they have not been put back on or have not been fitted properly - therefore the incident was directly linked to the work that Servicing Stop had recently carried out on my car. As you can imagine I was pretty horrified by all of this and sent an email to Servicing Stop customer service complaining as soon as I got back. I wanted to give them a chance to make amends to me and to ensure this sort of thing does not happen to anyone else. All of the correspondence I have had with them is attached and detailed in the timeline below, but suffice to say I have been far from impressed with their response. They came back to me today (August 23) and offered as a gesture of good will to pay \u00a355 towards the brake pads the AA man replaced (total cost I paid was \u00a3100.88) - this is completely unacceptable to me, on top of which I had a number of other complaints regarding the work they carried out, all of which they are aware of, but not responded to. My family reads your column in the Telegraph and have written to you before and you have always given excellent advice. I would be very grateful for your advice on what you think I should do next. As you can imagine I am incredibly angry about all of this and what might have happened. I want to make sure they are penalised to ensure this does not happen to anyone else and that I am fairly compensated for the shoddy work that I have paid for. Many thanks in advance for any help and advice you can provide me.\n\nHC, via email\n\nIn between the emotional bits, this is a fairly shocking account. But it reads more like a letter to Watchdog than to me. It is packed with unnecessarily statements such as: \"whilst I was driving on holiday with my family\"; \"whilst driving in Devon with 4 children and 3 adults in the car\"; \"My family as you can imagine were pretty shaken up by this.\"; \"My family and I were very lucky, if we had been driving and had to brake suddenly on a motorway, the narrow country lanes of Devon and Cornwall or when going down a steep hill with a sheer drop (of which we passed many) I dread to think what might have happened - I still cannot stop thinking about it now.\" ; \"As you can imagine I was pretty horrified by all of this.\" I'm not interested in any of this and neither would a Small Claims judge be. We don't have the time. Servicing Stop is an agency that appoints local garages to do jobs in the vicinity of the car owner's postcode. It is not a garage in itself. The fact is, it is a near certainty that the garage appointed by Servicing Stop botched the job of refitting one of the rear brake callipers. If they don't make a satisfactory offer beforehand, you can sue them for all costs associated with that in the Small Claims Track of the County Court. https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/overview/ You need to cut your statement to the Court to the barest minimum. Avoid all the emotional stuff you put into your letter to me. Restrict yourself to the cold facts surrounding the issue you are suing over. You might not have a case over the driveshaft boot because it cannot be proven. You will need signed testimony from whoever thought it had been torn when the wishbone was replaced. The fact they did not leave the replaced part in the car cannot be the subject of a damages claim. Either the wishbone was replaced or it wasn't and this will be obvious by the condition of the wishbone. The car could have veered to the left because replacing the wishbone affected its alignment and you refused to pay to have it realigned, which is necessary after replacing a suspension part. Definitely avoid phrases like \"contents of glove box on the floor of the car\". They were probably looking for the locking bolt for the wheels."]}, "Telefonica": {"2017-09-28": ["MILAN - Telecom Italia has picked a former Israeli army captain and Vivendi top manager as its new chief executive, betting on him to fend off rising competition in Italy, turn around operations in Brazil and appease politicians in Rome.\n\nAmos Genish was promoted just two months after being named general manager for operations at the Italian phone group, where Vivendi is an increasingly assertive top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.\n\nThe choice of the 57-year-old telecoms dealmaker - a former chief convergence officer at Vivendi and a favourite of its chairman Vincent Bollore - comes at a time of growing unease in Rome about the French group's influence over Italy Inc.\n\nAs Telecom Italia's (TIM) board met in Rome, Italian government officials discussed a possible fine for Vivendi on the grounds that it failed to notify authorities of its effective control of TIM - a company deemed strategic.\n\nGenish's predecessor, Flavio Cattaneo, left in July after clashing with both Vivendi and the Italian government.\n\nSmoothing the strained relationship between the former state phone monopoly and Rome will be a key priority for the new boss.\n\n\"TIM must have a constructive collaboration with the institutions and regulators,\" Executive Chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who also serves as Vivendi's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nIn an apparent olive branch to the Rome government, Vivendi left TIM's Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi - an Italian national - responsible for all assets associated with national security and defence, including international wholesale unit Sparkle.\n\nGenish takes the helm as TIM is fighting battles on several fronts: Its fixed-line business is losing value, new competitors are appearing in both broadband and mobile and its only foreign business, Brazil, is grappling with economic malaise.\n\n\"The investment case remains complex,\" Barclays, which has an 'equal weight' rating on the stock, said in a note.\n\nGenish's predecessor Cattaneo had launched a drive to cut costs, boost profitability and make Telecom Italia a more nimble competitor. He returned the domestic business to growth and raised investment in broadband and mobile infrastructure.\n\nStill, Genish inherits a company saddled with 25 billion euros ($29 billion) of debt, while the imminent arrival of low-cost French mobile operator Iliad is likely to squeeze margins. Also, rival investments in broadband infrastructure by power firm Enel are undermining TIM's broadband drive.\n\nBarclays said Iliad's entry and Enel's plans created \"uncertainties about the revenue trends in 2017 and beyond\".\n\nGenish is TIM's third CEO in less than two years, leaving some investors guessing what is Vivendi's ultimate aim for the company: Use it as a pillar of its plan to create a southern European media empire or as an asset to trade in the next wave of mergers in European telecoms.\n\nTIM, whose board also backed \"in principle\" a joint-venture with Vivendi's pay TV unit Canal+, is regarded as a takeover target because it is smaller than many of its European rivals.\n\nGenish and Vivendi go back years: Genish sold Brazilian telecoms start-up GVT to Vivendi in 2009 and five years later convinced Bollor\u00e9 to sell it on to Telefonica, making a capital gain of $4 billion for the French media group.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica Brasil, Genish grabbed market share from rivals and turned it into Brazil's most profitable carrier in spite of the worst recession in more than eight decades.\n\nInvestors hope Genish, who once described running GVT like \"a military operation\", will set in motion a similar overhaul at TIM.

Dangling from these balloons are receivers that are capable of streaming internet to and from phones on the ground below.\n\nAlthough the internet-beaming balloons have yet to be deployed in Puerto Rico, Google X (the secretive skunkworks) is considering the option:\n\n\"We're working hard with the Puerto Rican authorities to see if there's a way for us to use Loon balloons to bring some emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need,\" a Google X spokesperson said in a statement sent to Mashable.\n\nProject Loon seems like a particularly encouraging solution because this balloon technology was successfully deployed when extreme flooding knocked out communications in Peru, back in May. The circumstances between Peru and Puerto Rico, however, are far different. Before the floods hit, Project Loon was already testing for connectivity with a Peruvian telecommunication company, Telefonica.\n\n\"We were able to connect people in Peru quickly because we were already working closely with Telefonica on some testing; in this case, things are a little more complicated because we're starting from scratch,\" Google X told Mashable.\n\nIn Peru, Project Loon was able to send \"teams of balloons\" to the communication-less areas. The emergency experiment worked: The head of project Loon, Alastair Westgarth, wrote that tens of thousands of Peruvians were provided internet.\n\n\"More than 160 GB of data has been sent to people over a combined area of 40,000km2\u200a -- \u200athat's roughly the size of Switzerland\u200a -- \u200aand enough data to send and receive around 30 million WhatsApp messages, or 2 million emails,\" wrote Westgarth.\n\nJust like in Peru, Project Loon can't simply send high-altitude balloons to the region without first establishing a connection to telecommunication providers. \"In order to deliver a signal to people's devices, Loon needs be integrated with a telco partner's network -- the balloons can't do it alone,\" a Google X spokesperson told Mashable.\n\nGoogle isn't the only company with these high-flying internet ambitions. Facebook isn't in the balloon business, but is currently testing its internet-streaming Aquila drone. It's a massive unmanned plane with a wingspan greater than a Boeing 737. It's designed to fly at 60,000 feet, and in May Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote these solar-powered drones \"will beam internet to remote parts of the world and eventually break the record for longest unmanned aircraft flight.\"\n\nThe Google X balloons, however, seem significantly further along in development, so there's potential -- however small -- that Project Loon balloons could be deployed in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\n\"We're sorting through a lot of possible options now and are grateful for the support we're getting on the ground,\" said Google X in a statement sent to Mashable. And while Puerto Rico is still reeling, it might take more than internet balloons to help -- at least for now.", "Akamai Technologies, Inc.

He returned the domestic business to growth and raised investment in broadband and mobile infrastructure.\n\nStill, Genish inherits a company saddled with 25 billion euros ($29 billion) of debt, while the imminent arrival of low-cost French mobile operator Iliad is likely to squeeze margins. Also, rival investments in broadband infrastructure by power firm Enel are undermining TIM's broadband drive.\n\nBarclays said Iliad's entry and Enel's plans created \"uncertainties about the revenue trends in 2017 and beyond\".\n\nGenish is TIM's third CEO in less than two years, leaving some investors guessing what is Vivendi's ultimate aim for the company: Use it as a pillar of its plan to create a southern European media empire or as an asset to trade in the next wave of mergers in European telecoms.\n\nTIM, whose board also backed \"in principle\" a joint-venture with Vivendi's pay TV unit Canal+, is regarded as a takeover target because it is smaller than many of its European rivals.\n\nGenish and Vivendi go back years: Genish sold Brazilian telecoms start-up GVT to Vivendi in 2009 and five years later convinced Bollor\u00e9 to sell it on to Telefonica, making a capital gain of $4 billion for the French media group.\n\nAt Telef\u00f3nica Brasil, Genish grabbed market share from rivals and turned it into Brazil's most profitable carrier in spite of the worst recession in more than eight decades.\n\nInvestors hope Genish, who once described running GVT like \"a military operation\", will set in motion a similar overhaul at TIM.

It's the latest chapter in a saga that has seem Vivendi appear to assume total control over TIM despite owning less than a quarter of its shares.\n\nCattaneo had only been appointed in 2016 following the resignation of Marco Patuano, who had apparently been in dispute with Vivendi. The assumption was that Cattaneo had been a Vivendi-approved candidate but it seemed even he wasn't compliant enough for the French conglomerate's liking. TIM shareholders have handed over almost \u20ac30 million in compensation to Patuano and Cattaneo.\n\nGenish has been involved in the running of TIM since Cattaneo was shown the door. He joined Vivendi at the start of this year, having previously been CEO of Telef\u00f3nica Brazil. He did have a prior relationship with Vivendi, however, having been CEO of GVT when it was owned by Vivendi.\n\nIf Genish is appointed by a TIM board that is dominated by Vivendi, that will call TIM's autonomy further into question. The Italian regulator has already said it thinks Vivendi has de facto control, although it remains unclear what, if anything, it's going to do about it. All this talk would go away if Vivendi just paid up for a majority stake in TIM, but the current acquisition on the cheap approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth.", "Telefonica SA (NYSE:TEF) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a \"buy\" rating to a \"hold\" rating in a research report issued on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Zacks, \"Telefonica should benefit from the launch of video services in several Latin-American markets, widespread adoption of broadband and data services, pricing revision, network enhancement and strategic collaborations, continued focus on organic growth and portfolio optimization.

It operates in S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the country's Federal District.\n\nIt offers fixed broadband, mobile and pay TV services - via cable and satellite - to consumer and business customers.\n\nAlgar Telecom had 528,000 fixed broadband customers at the end of July, having added over 44,000 over the previous 12 months, according to regulator Anatel. As a result, the firm has a market share of around 2%, which makes it the market's fourth largest operator, behind America Movil, Telefonica and Oi, but ahead of TIM.\n\nOn the mobile side, Algar Telecom comes in sixth, behind the big four and Nextel's local unit, with 1.34 million customers at the end of June and a 0.55% share of the market.", "SAN SEBASTIAN -- \"Spanish Shame\" is the first whole TV series to be screened at San Sebastian Film Festival. It's also the first full series from Movistar +, the pay TV arm of Telefonica, No other European telecom has driven so much or so fast into high-end original series. As such \"Spanish Shame\" is a pioneer. It may also prove a milestone.\n\nCompetinfg at San Sebastian's Zabaltegi-Tabakalera showcase, which has been srnthened this year to include a panopl,yof edgier fare, mostly movies, \"Spanish Shame\" stars Javier Guti\u00e9rrez (\"Marshland, \"The Motive\") and Malena Alterio (\"Five Square Meters\"). The 10-part half-hour offer a black humored romantic comedy tapping into Spanish classic movie tradition of dark comedies of frustration (think Rafael Azcona) black humor as well as, in a refreshing turn, echoing U.S. references such as \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" or \"Louie,\" - something singular in contemporary Spanish TV production.\n\nIn \"Spanish Shame\" an aspiring art photographer with a monumental lack of talent still makes his living after 20 years of trying to scorer an exhibition as a photographer at weddings, communions. His personal life lurches from one ridiculous social embarrassment to another.\n\nSeries is written and directed by Juan Cavestany (\"People in Places\") and \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez Armero (\"Sidetracked\") and is co-produced by Apache Films, whose founder, Enrique L\u00f3pez Lavigne, has producer credits including \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"The Impossible.\" \"In a way, it's anti-concept -you will feel embarrassed as you watch it.\"\n\nWhat will the viewer find in \"Shame\"?\n\nAlvaro Fern\u00e1ndez Armero: A comedy plumbing the darkest zones of social relationships, and focusing on certain very recognizable situations, to which we've applied a magnifying glass.\n\nAnd a romcom...\n\nJuan Cavestany: It's especially a romcom, a feature structured in episodes. If you watch it in one go, you'll see that this is the love-story of a couple in permanent crisis.\n\nThe show has a distinct second half, with another dramatic tone...\n\nArmero: The idea was to cook the tragedy over a low heat. It's very different to watch the whole series in a one-go than one episode at a time. The second half is what we like best. At the beginning, the protagonist is presented without much ado. Viewers might think they're going to hate him. But the final stretches are even more painful. It's a sort of a perverse game.\n\nIt's also a pioneering series in the sense of its deep irreverence. Would you agree?\n\nCavestany: Traditionally Spanish series have tried to please everyone, including advertisers, target all demos with fiction , aimed at giving viewers a good night's sleep. Some amazing series have been made but Movistar + isn't pursuing this line and gave us complete freedom, the capacity to establish limits just considering the limits the series we liked. This was the challenge.\n\nSpain black humor has deep roots in literature and cinema (Luis Berlanga, Rafael Azcona, \u00c1lex de la Iglesia), but not in TV. These meet in \"Spanish Shame\" with with Larry David and Louis C.K. for instance. Do you agree?\n\nCavestany: These are references that we've channelled. I'm happy you've felt them. We were obsessed with \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" ten years ago. We were also attracted to \"The Office\" as well. However, we're at a specific age, we're Spaniards and we try to assimilate both sources. We wondered why these series were working so well. Our conclusion was that they were auto-biographical, had a deep sense of honesty. We tried to do something similar with our own storytelling traditions. But it's almost childish to do something \"in the manner of.\" So we used our own intuition and our own lives.\n\nThe castings of Guti\u00e9rrez and Alterio were spot on.\n\nCavestany: The main role was expressly written for Javier. In fact, the pilot was titled \"Guti\u00e9rrez.\" He is an actor capable of provoking a fast and deep empathy with the audience and he's not afraid to put himself into the most abject and pathetic mud holes. He's performing a tremendously racist and offensive character and inviting you to identify with him at the same time. What Javier does is pretty brave.\n\nArmero: Although it sounds odd, I believe it's due to a terrifying sensation of identification. You imagine that you could have the same embarrassing experience that another person is living.\n\nCavestany: I think it's similar to fear. What is fear about? It's something that tickles. Good comedy is similar, you feel a tingling. Shame could be a variety of this. It's a common territory of comedy and terror, linked to being exposed, shedding one's mask. It hurts, but it's also funny.\n\nJuan, what has \u00c1lvaro's contribution been?\n\nCavestany: Each cooperation is a different universe. \u00c1lvaro has an insightful vision of social and relationship matters linked to a consciousness of running the risk of making a fool of oneself. He is great at talking to actors and provides a big dose of practicality to the shoot.\n\nAnd \u00c1lvaro, what was Juan's contribution?\n\nArmero: Juan's big input comes from his own particular universe. He has always defended the idea of building a personal series. Juan has an eye for seductive imagery of habitual losers and defenseless human beings.", "The report also said that last year saw an unprecedented increase in data breaches with vast amounts of data being stolen. -- Reuters picTHE HAGUE, Sept 28 -- An \"epidemic\" has erupted in global ransomware attacks, taking over computers as well as internet-linked devices like routers and CCTV cameras to turn them into tools for criminals, Europe's police agency said yesterday.\n\n\"Ransomware attacks have eclipsed most other global cybercrime threats, with the first half of 2017 witnessing ransomware attacks on a scale previously unseen,\" Europol said, as it released its latest annual report on internet organised crime.\n\nThis included the WannaCry ransomware attack in May, believed to have rapidly infected as many as 300,000 targets in 150 countries including some high-profile ones such as Britain's National Health Service, Spanish telecoms company Telefonica, and logistics company Fed-Ex.\n\n\"The global impact of huge cyber security events such as the WannaCry ransomware epidemic has taken the threat from cybercrime to another level,\" Europol's chief Rob Wainwright said.\n\n\"Banks and other major businesses are now targeted on a scale not seen before,\" he said at the launch of the 80-page report.\n\nAt the same time, late 2016 saw the first \"massive attacks\" on insecure devices connected to the so-called internet of things.\n\nIn one case the notorious Mirai malware hacked into about 150,000 internet-linked devices like cellphones, routers, printers and security cameras to mount a \"complex... sophisticated\" attack.\n\nThe malware transformed them into botnets capable of launching a so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, Europol said.\n\nThey were responsible for a number of high profile attacks, including one which severely disrupted internet infrastructure on the West Coast of the United States.\n\nEuropol warned that the \"collective response to cyber-criminals is still not good enough.\"\n\n\"In particular people and companies everywhere must do more to better protect themselves,\" it said.\n\nThe report also said that last year saw an unprecedented increase in data breaches with vast amounts of data being stolen, including over two billion records related to EU citizens reportedly leaked over a 12-month period.\n\nEuropean safety commissioner Julian King said Europol's latest report \"shows online crime is the new frontier of law enforcement.\"\n\n\"We've all seen the impact of events like WannaCry.

But as we also learned this week, the market is changing rapidly and the lines of distinction between the wholesale and retail markets are blurring to such an extent that the concept of the carrier in its current guise could soon cease to exist.\n\nThere is currently a two-speed wholesale market, said Daniel Kurgan, CEO of BICS, speaking at the 20th annual Carriers World event in London on Tuesday. The \"good old\" legacy wholesale business still exists, where carriers sit down and trade minutes. \"In 20 years some of you will sit here and its going to be the same,\" he predicted.\n\nQuite possibly, although the volumes are changing. In the 1990s, when Carriers World launched, the carriers talked in terms of \"minutes and megabytes,\" said David James, practice leader, wholesale telecoms, at Ovum. Carriers still deal in minutes, but \"now we're talking terrabytes, and even a lot of that is being used up.\"\n\nHowever, back then the words 'wholesale' and 'innovation' \"never appeared in the same sentence,\" said James. Things have changed.\n\nThe second prong of today's wholesale market is centred on the provision of much more complex solutions and relationships with new types of providers, Kurgan said, referring to his company's recent acquisition of communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) company TeleSign.\n\nAnd business models are changing too.\n\nCarriers need to decide which segment to address, rather than focusing on the split between retail and wholesale, Kurgan said. \"When we review our strategy, that's how we do it...It's not retail/wholesale at all.\"\n\nHe was not the only one to share a similar message.\n\n\"Wholesale is the new retail,\" said Hot Telecom CEO Isabelle Paradis. \"You have to enable the operator to serve the end user,\" she told the carriers.\n\nTim Passingham, VP of wholesale at Colt, also believes that \"the wholesale market has to evolve,\" moving in a direction more akin to the TNT space. \"The traditional name [of] wholesale has to change,\" he said.\n\nTechnology evolution is also changing the way carriers do business between themselves. There was much talk at the event about IPX and hubbing services, with a particular focus on the reasons behind the mobile operator community's reluctance to adopt the former. However, carriers are using these types of services, which led Ovum's James to wonder whether the long-established relationships between carriers are as vital as they were 20 years ago.\n\n\"You don't do business entirely digitally,\" said Tom Homer, CEO, EMEA, at Telstra. \"The personal relationship is critically important.\"\n\nAnd Eduardo Guardincerri, CMO at Telefonica Business Solutions, agreed. Carriers don't need a vendor in between them, \"if we can come here and talk,\" he said.\n\nAt Total Telecom we heard that message loud and clear. So, to facilitate those personal relationships we threw a party, bringing the carriers together on a lovely sunny evening (we got lucky!) at a venue overlooking the Thames. In addition to pouring the bubbly, we also announced the results of the third annual Carriers World Awards, in which the winners are decided based on a industry vote.\n\nIn an age in which the validity and reliability of telecoms industry awards has been thrown into question, we think this system makes these awards particularly valuable. 4,000 individuals cast their votes, frequently voting across all 11 categories; we counted a total of 41,000 votes!\n\nCongratulations to all the winners (listed below). I would like to make particular reference to the last two awards of the evening, which illustrate how far this industry has come over the past 20 years.\n\nThe penultimate trophy went to Hutchison Global Communications, which was crowned Most Innovative Wholesaler. As David James noted, the concept of an innovative wholesaler is relatively new, but will be key to the future of the industry.\n\nSimilarly, BT Wholesale scooped the 20th Anniversary Award, not for its longevity in this industry, although that certainly helped, but because it has built a solid platform on which to develop its business over the next 20 years and - we hope - beyond.\n\nIt is impossible to predict how the wholesale market will evolve in the coming years, or even whether the concept of traditional wholesale will even exist, but Carriers World 2017 provided a great insight into the state of the market at present and the direction of travel. In a nutshell, carriers are still talking to each other and still selling minutes, but they are also looking at those innovative business models that will help them serve their customers' customers.\n\nCARRIERS WORLD AWARDS 2017\n\nBest Messaging Solution\n\nVodafone Carrier Services - Messaging Solutions\n\nBest Security/Fraud Solution\n\nDeutsche Telekom ICSS - ICSS 360\u00b0 Defense Strategy\n\nBest Signalling Solution\n\nEtisalat SmartHub - SS7 (Signaling System No. 7)\n\nTechnology Innovation Award\n\nBridgeVoice - Automated carrier platform that bridges the gap between operators and retailers\n\nBest IoT initiative\n\nSAP Digital Interconnect - SAP IoT Connect 365, operator service\n\nMost Innovative Wholesaler\n\nHutchison Global Communications (HGC) - cross-country customer network", "By Richard Lough\n\nPARIS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has been quick to follow up his sweeping rhetorical call for European renewal with concrete action, backing two cross-border mergers that aim to boost Europe's competitiveness in globalised industries.\n\nThe moves drew applause from supporters of deeper EU integration but criticism from trade unions alarmed by Macron's apparent readiness to ditch France's traditional industrial policy of shielding national assets from foreign competitors.\n\nIn a keynote speech on Tuesday, the 39-year-old president set out an ambitious vision for a \"sovereign, united and democratic Europe\" based on closer cooperation on defence, migration and finance.\n\nHours after the speech, Germany's Siemens and French engineering group Alstom announced plans to merge their rail businesses, creating a pan-European champion better able to face down competition from China.\n\nThe politically sensitive deal was backed by the French government.

This year the results focus on the theme of digital transformation in the business-to-business sector.\n\nNine companies make the shortlist, here is why. In a nutshell the Users' Choice Award recognises the operator with the highest customer-centric transformation score.\n\nAccording to Janet Watkin, Managing Director of Ocean82 \"The success of any business transformation, ultimately, will be decided by user' perceived value, experienced over time, ''the choice' driver\".\n\nIt is in making decisions about which services to try, buy, and integrate that users themselves massively shape the business evolution of service providers. In making these decisions they are rejecting alternatives. These decisions are influenced by past experiences, not just of the product, but of dealing with the supplier organisations on a human level.\n\nTo effectively evaluate the transformation journey of major global providers, users were asked about the major decision factors that fed into their selection of offers and operators.There were four topics: Change (innovation, merger & acquisition) Selection (who to consider and first purchase), Replication, (buying more/contract renewal) and Co-operation (mutual benefit). Gauging the customer experience on each of these critical areas allows an analysis of digital transformation in a commercial context.\n\nThe digital zenith method (dizeme), used in the analysis, recognises that to measure perceptions of business evolution and organisation fit to environment the paradox that competition and co-operation are locked together in ceaseless conflict must be addressed.\n\nThe claim from evolving telcos is that their aim is to provide an unrivalled customer experience. The strategic approach, in nearly every case, claims to place the customer at the heart of the digital transformation. Each telco aspires to be truly 'customer centric'.\n\nThe truth is that change is hard to embrace and many resist it. Silos are difficult to breakdown. In the words of Peter Drucker, the world renowned management consultant, 'culture eats strategy for breakfast.' Strong leadership to bring about alignment of people and process to deliver an outstanding customer experience is vital.\n\nConfidence in digital transformation to provide agility and flexibility means much more than offering technological solutions. It means the market must embrace new innovations and suppliers must manage demand effectively in the face of a changing competitive landscape. A culture of care must prevail. In the business enterprise market this is done most successfully through the development of trusted partnerships between supplier and customer.\n\nTHE 2017 USERS' CHOICE SHORTLIST\n\nAT&T\n\nBT\n\nNTT Communications\n\nOrange Business Services\n\nSingtel\n\nTata Communications\n\nTelefonica\n\nVerizon\n\nVodafone\n\nTo see who wins, book your table for the World Communication Awards dinner in London on the 28 November 2017.\n\nGreater insight into the research behind this award category can be found in Ocean82's new Digital Zenith Benchmark report, which will be published on the 1 November 2017.

The opinions expressed are his own.)\n\nBy Liam Proud\n\nLONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Telecom Italia's new boss should have one main goal: fix its governance discount. Unless former Israeli army captain Amos Genish mends relations with Rome and clarifies the intentions of top shareholder Vivendi, TI's depressed valuation will endure.\n\nTI's third chief executive since March 2016, Genish joins at a critical time with the imminent entry of low-price operator Iliad in Italy's already cutthroat market. He also inherits several tricky governance tangles.\n\nProblem number one is the Italian government. Vivendi's creeping control, which began in 2015, has angered Rome, which sees TI's network as a strategic asset, and is threatening to fine the group. TI's move to give Italian Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi oversight of politically-sensitive assets may help, but the risk is that Genish's outsider status makes smoothing relations more difficult. It doesn't help that Telecom Italia is in competition with state-backed Open Fiber to build a broadband network.\n\nThen there's Vivendi itself. Its arrival has triggered an expensive merry-go-round in the group's C-suite. Previous CEO Flavio Cattaneo left with a 25 million euro payout this summer after clashing with Vivendi. In 2016 his predecessor Marco Patuano left after a boardroom fallout, according to the Financial Times.\n\nPerhaps TI will finally see some stability now Vivendi has its man: Genish was a lieutenant of Chairman Vincent Bollor\u00e9 as chief convergence officer at Vivendi. But that brings risks. Take the joint venture with the French group's troubled TV arm Canal Plus to develop content, approved at the same board meeting as Genish's appointment. The logic is to accelerate \"telecoms-media convergence\", but investors will need to see a clear financial plan to know it is in Telecom Italia's interest. Most European telco investments in content have lost money, according to Credit Suisse. The planned JV was only approved with a majority vote on Thursday's board meeting, while Genish's appointment was unanimously agreed.\n\nTI's share price is down by a third since since Bollor\u00e9's group became its largest shareholder in June 2015. It now trades at a 9 percent discount to peers, based on the ratio of its enterprise value to forecast EBITDA. Fixing that will require military precision.\n\n- Telecom Italia appointed Amos Genish chief executive, the company said in a statement on Sept. 28.\n\n- Genish, a former Israeli army captain, was appointed general manager for operations at the Italian group at the end of July, shortly after CEO Flavio Cattaneo left after clashing with top shareholder Vivendi.\n\n- Genish was previously chief convergence officer at Vivendi, which holds a 24 percent stake in Telecom Italia. Before that he ran Telefonica Brasil.\n\n- Telecom Italia Executive Deputy Chairman Giuseppe Recchi will oversee \"all activities and assets that are relevant for security and national defence purposes\", the group also said in the statement.\n\n- Telecom Italia faces a possible fine from Italian authorities for failing to notify the government that Vivendi has assumed de facto control of the group, Reuters reported on Sept. 29 citing government sources.\n\n- Vivendi denies its holding has given it effective control of the company.\n\n- The French group's Executive Chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine is also CEO of Vivendi. On Sept. 28 the board approved with a majority vote a joint venture with Vivendi's Canal Plus, \"intended to enable a major acceleration of the plans for telecoms-media convergence\".\n\n- Telecom Italia shares were down 0.8 percent to 0.79 euros at 0850 BST. Vivendi shares were up almost 1 percent at 21.01 euros.\n\n- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on\n\n- SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS http://bit.ly/BVsubscribe", "TIM on Thursday, as expected, named Amos Genish as its new chief executive officer, and shared other outcomes from its board meeting, including updated governance and procedures that take account of the Consob control ruling and a vote in favour of a joint venture between the telco and Vivendi's Canal+ business.

The JV will focus on content production, Italian and international, and on the acquisition of content rights, including sports rights, it said.\n\nThe telco's board will discuss the JV again at a future date before giving a final approval, having taken advice on the terms and conditions, and the regulatory implications of the deal.\n\nGenish founded Brazilian fixed broadband and TV provider GVT, which he sold to Vivendi in 2009. He was still serving as the telco's CEO when Vivendi agreed to sell it to Telefonica in 2014. After the deal closed, Genish became CEO of Telefonica Brasil, but resigned that position in October 2016.\n\nHe takes the top job at TIM at a crucial time. The telco is currently fighting a legal battle in Italy regarding the influence Vivendi exercises over its operations. Earlier this month regulator Consob ruled that Vivendi has de facto control of TIM, since it has sufficient voting power to control the telco's board and the direction of its shareholder meetings.\n\nAt Thursday's meeting, the TIM board updated procedure for transactions with related parties to take account of the Consob ruling.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the Italian government could levy a fine on the company for failing to comply with regulations covering a change of control at the telco. There has also been talk of enforced asset sales, with particular reference to international carrier Telecom Italia Sparkle, which is considered a strategic asset because of its infrastructure.\n\nAt the meeting TIM conferred responsibility for Sparkle onto deputy chairman Giuseppe Recchi.\n\nSpecifically, Recchi will have organisational responsibility for TIM's security department, which includes \"overseeing all activities and assets that are relevant for security and national defence purposes inside TIM and the other Italian companies in the group (in particular: TI Sparkle and Telsy),\" TIM said. Telsy is an ICT security solutions and services provider for government and corporate customers.\n\nThe meeting also set out new governance arrangements for TIM.\n\nAs such, executive chairman de Puyfontaine will identify guidelines for the development of TIM, as well as supervising the delivery of its strategic, industrial and financial plans. He will supervise its organisational arrangements, including legal affairs, and is charged with representing the company in external relations with public authorities, institutions and investors.\n\nHowever, responsibility for brand strategy and media is transferred from de Puyfontaine to Genish.\n\nGenish also has responsibility for the overall governance of the company, including responsibility for defining strategic and financial plans, proposing them to the board, and implementing and developing them.\n\nHe also takes responsibility \"for defining the policies and all organisational responsibilities to guarantee the management and development of the business in Italy and in South America,\" TIM said.", "MADRID -- Telefonica's Movistar + bows two of its first series, \"The Plague\" and \"Spanish Shame\" at San Sebasti\u00e1n.

A former Israeli army captain, Genish previously headed Vivo, the Brazilian unit of Spain's Telefonica, a position he took following the merger of Vivo and broadband operator GVT, before being named Vivendi's chief convergence officer. The appointment is seen as a further sign of the French media giant's influence over TIM, where it's the leading shareholder via a 24 percent stake and two-thirds of the company's board.", "Halfway through my interview with the National Lottery boss, Dermot Griffin, I ask if he thinks playing the Lotto is gambling. It's a loaded question but a legitimate one. Buying a lottery ticket is a fixed-odds bet, akin to spinning the roulette wheel. The only difference is the chance of winning. In the case of roulette it's 35 to one; in the case of the Irish lottery it's 10.7 million to one.\n\nThe colossal difference seems to blur the connection for many people, allowing mass-participation lotteries sell themselves as purveyors of harmless fun, separate from their more socially destructive bookmaking and casino cousins.\n\nFor Griffin the dividing line seems to come down to stake - small in the case of lotteries, potentially big in the case of sports betting - and to the money raised for good causes. \"The National Lottery differs from other forms of gaming in that it is based on many players wagering small stakes. It was also set up with the express purpose of raising funds for good causes,\" he says.\n\nSince its inception, in 1987, the franchise has raised more than \u20ac5 billion for good causes, channelling money into hundreds of charities and community organisations. \"And, unlike bookmakers, we don't play against our players. We say, here's the percentage that's going into the prize fund, and that will be won, it's just a question of who wins it.\"\n\nValid though his points are, they're more like mitigating factors. The National Lottery's newly revamped website has about 20 flashy instant-win games that wouldn't look out of place on a traditional gambling website, and would equate to what addiction experts view as trigger points for problem gamblers.\n\nNonetheless, Griffin says the business has endeavoured to be responsible in opening up its online portal, placing strict controls on how much time and money players can spend online. He also says the business has worked with the Rutland Centre, which specialises in treating addiction, to ensure its responsible-gaming messages are appropriate. If there is a dividing line I don't see it.\n\nThe last time I met Griffin, in February 2015, he was a harried man. The lottery had for the first time in its 27-year history been forced to postpone its Wednesday- evening draw following a technical blowout that downed ticket machines in shops across the Republic.\n\nThe newly privatised business, which is now run by Premier Lotteries Ireland instead of An Post, had just switched to a new technology platform that appeared to be malfunctioning. Griffin was getting it in the neck from disgruntled punters, out-of-pocket retailers and the business's new principal owner, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, known to be a fearsome taskmaster.\n\nThe incident, coming on the back of problems with new in-store ticket terminals, had put the business in the eye of a storm like never before, and prompted allegations that it had skimped on technology to recoup the \u20ac405 million spent on the Irish licence.\n\nGriffin, however, lays the blame squarely on Telef\u00f3nica, the lottery's telecoms provider, and a freak event, which saw the telco's Madrid exchange go down and a lightning storm knock out its back-up routers. A report to the lottery regulator has never been made public.\n\n\"When you've no telecoms you can't take the wagers. By the time we got [the system] back up we felt there wasn't enough time for everyone who wanted to get into the draw,\" Griffin says, insisting the lottery's new gaming technology was not at fault.\n\nThe \u20ac10 million draw, the largest in 10 months, took place the following night amid recrimination about the new operator's integrity. Greater resilience has since been built into its telecoms network.\n\nGriffin sidesteps a question about how difficult this period was for him personally, or how close he came to getting the chop, insisting the privatisation process and the move to a new technology platform have been a success and have given the business a long-overdue facelift.\n\nEither way, Griffin is more chipper than he was back then. Not only are the company's technology woes seemingly behind it, but he's just delivered a rosy set of annual accounts for the business and its new owners.\n\nThey show that turnover - effectively revenue from ticket and scratch-card sales - rose by 12 per cent, to \u20ac750 million, in 2016, the highest level in nearly a decade. Sales through its interactive channels also jumped, by 77 per cent, to \u20ac40.7 million, while the number of players registered online has leapt to 387,000. This was achieved alongside a near 10 per cent rise in offline sales despite fears that opening up the online channel would cannibalise the retail business. The franchise also delivered \u20ac213 million - about 30 per cent of turnover, up from \u20ac193 million in 2015 - for good causes.\n\nPerhaps most significantly for Griffin, he has also delivered a \u20ac16 million operating profit, up 121 per cent on the previous year, for his Canadian bosses, seemingly justifying their faith in sticking with him.\n\nStanding still in the fast-moving gaming industry is inviting trouble, however, as is overplaying your hand when you have a winning formula.\n\nA case in point is Premier Lotteries Ireland's UK sister company, Camelot, also owned by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which appears to have damaged its business model by chasing bigger and bigger jackpots, which typically bring in more players, bolstering ticket sales. Two years ago, much to players' annoyance, Camelot added 10 numbers to its original 49-number matrix, reducing the chance of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million.\n\nBefore the 10 extra balls were introduced punters scooped the jackpot 61 times in just 12 months, but the top prize has been claimed only 39 times since the rule change. In January last year the jackpot hit a record \u00a358 million, but it was only after 14 rollovers and serious \"jackpot fatigue\" among punters. The changes have backfired, triggering a significant fall in ticket sales for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe Irish lottery took a more modest approach to change, deciding to tweak the format by adding just two numbers to its 45-number matrix while upping the price per line by 50 cent. Although this reduced the chance of winning from one in eight million to one in 10.7 million, it has resulted in bigger jackpots and higher ticket sales without alienating punters.\n\nSince the rule change 23 jackpots of between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac10 million have been won, 10 per cent more than under the previous format, and five of \u20ac10 million, 12 per cent more than previously.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the new format has yet to deliver a jackpot bigger than the record \u20ac18.8 million scooped by a syndicate in Carlow in 2008. Griffin and his team, however, are confident of hitting a \u20ac20 million prize before 2020. \"You need to get the balance between the numbers, the price and the prize right,\" Griffin says, noting that although creating exciting jackpots is part of the business, too many rollovers can deter players.\n\nDespite what you might think, big city-centre shops, not tiny west-of-Ireland village stores, generate the most jackpot winners, with the GPO, on O'Connell Street in Dublin, topping the rankings. \"It's simply a product of footfall,\" says Griffin.\n\nOpening the business to an online audience, one of the carrots of privatisation, has obviously been a boon, but it has coincided with the emergence of an Uber-style assault on the business. Websites like Lottoland and Jackpot. com are now offering consumers the chance to select numbers both for the lottery here and, perhaps more enticingly, for the monster draws in the US, where jackpots frequently hit $1 billion, without buying an actual ticket: if a player hits the right numbers, the companies pledge to pay the equivalent prize money, relying on a complex formula of hedging and insurance.\n\nLottoland has upped the ante by offering a price of \u20ac2 per line to play EuroMillions, compared with \u20ac2.50 through the National Lottery. The normally soft-spoken Griffin doesn't hide his venom for the new buccaneers of the trade. They are, \"in effect, parasites trying to jump\" in on top of the lottery's jackpot. \"The reason the lottery was set up was to raise funds for good causes, and these firms pose a threat to that,\" he says, pointing out that the firms are based offshore and are not regulated like the lottery. Although they have yet to make much of an impact here, they've grabbed market share in the UK and Australia. The longer they exist the greater the foothold they get, he says.\n\nSurfing the privatisation wave appears to be a theme in Griffin's career. Before becoming the lottery boss he was a commercial director for Vodafone, having made the transition from Eircell, Telecom \u00c9ireann's former mobile arm, which was sold to the UK telco in 2001, a process not altogether dissimilar from the National Lottery's recent privatisation.\n\nHe took over at the company in 2006, when it was operated by An Post, and was appointed chief executive of Premier Lotteries Ireland as part of the privatisation process, in 2015. \"This is the second time I've moved from the public to the private sector,\" Griffin says. The key lesson from both processes, he says, is planning.\n\nThe first thing jackpot winners are told when they are presented with their cheques at the National Lottery headquarters is to do nothing for at least a period, presumably to guard against rash undertakings. It's not a luxury afforded Griffin, who knows that players' appetites can change on a whim and that today's winning formula can be tomorrow's losing streak.\n\nPosition Chief executive of Premier Lotteries Ireland, operator of the National Lottery\n\nSomething you might expect As operator of the State's favourite weekly flutter, Griffin is forbidden from playing. But, he says, buying a lottery ticket is the first thing he does when on holidays abroad\n\nSomething you might not expect Unusually for an accountant, he claims the most enjoyable part of his job is handing over fat cheques", "(ANSA) - Rome, September 28 - Israeli executive Amos Genish was named TIM CEO at a board meeting Thursday, sources said.\n\nGenish, 57, moves up from operational director, a post he earned in July after Flavio Cattaneo quit as CEO.\n\nHis previous posts include president and CEO of Telefonica Brasil, the largest and most profitable telecoms operator in Brazil.\n\nTIM President Arnaud de Puyfontaine said \"we have taken a very good decision, we have a great boss with great experience in telecoms\".

The difference, though, is ... in places like Korea and the US, you've seen more of an interest in influencing the specification and the standard, so you've seen a lot of early activity there,\" Topol explained.\n\n\"Australia is a focus more on 'let's focus on the use case and actual physical testing', because there's more of a desire to focus on what's the commercial viability of this solution.\n\n\"They're both good reasons to jump in and work on the technology.\"\n\nTopol said Telstra has been a \"great partner\" for Intel in Australia, with the two collaborating on 5G New Radio (NR) trials.\n\n\"We have recently put an agreement in place, and we've not worked through all the parameters yet,\" he told ZDNet. \"There's interest in growing the type of use cases and maybe the industries that 5G can benefit from.\"\n\nTopol said he expects Intel's trial work in Australia to focus on supplementing the nation's biggest industries, such as mining and agriculture.\n\nAccording to Topol, Australia hosting a major 3GPP meeting next September again shows the country's interest in commercialisation rather than influencing specifications, as standards should simply be given the final tick of approval during that vote.\n\n\"[Telstra] are a participant like many other operators, chip vendors, and others in contributing study items and ideas of how to shape the standard ... [but] when that vote happens, that's really the green light for the ecosystem to start moving to a commercial deployment of 5G,\" Topol explained.\n\n\"We start building chips, Telstra starts placing their infrastructure orders, and they start building out their networks, and the point is that this is a great emphasis on Australia because when that vote happens, it is a pretty momentous or monumental point for 5G, because it's now the beginning of 5G becoming a commercial platform.\n\n\"But the study items have been worked on over the last year, and will continue to be worked on until September.\"\n\nOne reason why Australian carriers are so focused on commercial trials could be the regulatory barrier, which means telcos must essentially prove what the network can do before they will be assigned spectrum.\n\n\"In many cases, a lot of the partners and ecosystems in Australia, it's also on their shoulders to build those use cases and demonstrate where it does work best and where it doesn't, because that's a lot of times where regulatory bodies need help in properly assigning spectrum,\" he argued.\n\n\"So it's a bit of responsibility on the wireless ecosystem to do that.\"\n\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has been examining potential spectrum bands to be used 5G, recently accelerating the process of investigating millimetre-wave (mmWave) bands as well as looking into 3.6GHz, following concerns from the industry that Australia would fall behind international counterparts and lose its global leadership position in mobile.\n\nOver the last year, Australia's three telcos -- Telstra, Optus, and Vodafone -- have been working on live 5G trials with Ericsson, Huawei, and Nokia to show the speeds and latency that various specific consumer and business applications could attain.\n\nBy comparison, Topol said Korean and US testing has been more about developing 5G technologies across spectrum, and their use for fixed-wireless to extend home broadband, before expanding into use cases across automotive and mobility applications such as handsets and drones.\n\nIn South Korea, Intel has been working with SK Telecom and Korea Telecom on 5G mobile device and network developments and verification, including a modem that supports 5G, concepts for anchor-booster cell and Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), solutions for Licensed Assisted Access (LAA), virtual network platforms, and joint standardisation.\n\n\"A lot of the early [Korean] trials have been on fixed-wireless, because when you bring up a new mobile technology, you first want to make sure that it's a great technology, and so to do that you focus on fixed point-to-point use cases,\" he told ZDNet.\n\n\"A lot of work also has been millimetre-wave based ... we've been able to get multi-gigabit-per-second connections which have been fantastic, and so we're starting to apply that now into automotive use cases ... and then we're starting to do testing on lower frequencies now, the sub-6GHz frequencies which are more like the way that cellular and Wi-Fi technologies work today where it's kind of a broader umbrella coverage.\n\n\"We see it really as a technology that's going to use both types of spectrum, both the lower frequencies and the higher, and be a bit of a mesh network.\"\n\nIn the US, AT&T is using Intel's 5G mobile trial platform in its Indiana, Texas, and Michigan trials, while Verizon relies on Intel for its 11 pre-commercial 5G trial networks. The Verizon trials have also been used for testing interoperability and mmWave spectrum.\n\n\"Again, it's more the maturity of the technology, and we've had great success in using it in fixed-wireless, and again now you're starting to see the application into early mobility and we've been looking at vehicle testing as the next good platform,\" Topol said.\n\n\"But again, think of the path that the use cases have different states of maturity because some are easier to demonstrate on the technology, and that's where you start, and others take a bit more time.\n\n\"They might have a technology barrier, they might have a regulatory barrier. Some industries, there are still some regulatory aspects that need to be worked out before you apply a technology like this.\"\n\nIntel has also developed a mini Cloud-RAN concept with China Mobile; conducted 5G handset chipset trials with NTT DoCoMo; developed use cases for 5G devices and architectures with Deutsche Telekom; tested 5G devices and technologies using Telefonica's NFV Reference lab and open research lab 5Tonic; and used Vodafone's innovation labs in the UK to test hardware and software and conduct 5G trials on Vodafone's global radio and core networks.\n\nIntel has also been working with networking companies worldwide, collaborating with Ericsson on 5G, cloud, and IoT trials, as well as interoperability across 3.5GHz; Nokia on pre-standard 5G radio technologies, networking solutions, and interoperability; and Huawei on 5G NR, cloud, and network function virtualisation (NFV) solutions.\n\nIntel has also worked with [PDF] Cisco on developing and trialling a 5G router with Ericsson; ZTE on developing a 5G network slicing prototype for China Mobile utilising Intel Xeon processors; and LG Electronics on developing and trialling 5G telematics technology for automotive applications.\n\nTopol said Intel's collaboration with vendors is twofold: Providing them with the infrastructure and compute platforms to be used for trials; and taking part in interoperability tests between base station and network access before taking the results to both 3GPP and carriers.\n\nThe partners that work with Intel are all interested in either influencing 3GPP specifications, Topol said, or have \"a very specific use case they want to apply it to\".\n\nIntel is also seeing increasing amounts of interest as standards are coming closer to being set at the end of next year, with telcos wanting what is almost certain to be the blueprint for how they need to build out their networks.\n\nIntel announced its first 5G trial platform in February last year, supporting sub-6GHz and mmWave spectrum, with a second-generation platform integrating 4x4 MIMO then launched a year ago; this was followed by its third-generation Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform unveiled earlier this month.\n\nThe new platform will allow for device innovation by supporting initial 5G NR specifications in live tests with partners by the end of the year to be developed alongside 3GPP standards, and is powered by Intel's field-programmable gate array (FGPA) circuits and Core i7 processors, enabling it to implement the latest communications protocols and air interfaces.\n\nAt launch, it will support 3GPP NR early interoperability; the 600-900MHz, 3.3-4.2GHz, 4.4-4.9GHz, 5.1-5.9GHz, 28GHz, and 39GHz spectrum bands; and a mobile interoperability solution for end-to-end 5G field testing.\n\n\"We've already built the hardware, we've already been testing with a lot of the trial specification work, and we'll take the full functionality of that release on it at the end of the quarter with the vote and it'll be available to partners to start testing,\" Topol said.\n\nDespite testing across many different applications and use cases, Topol still feels that the technologies that will drive 5G in the end are the currently unknown ones, with Intel as a result making end-to-end development its priority.\n\n\"Our goal has been defining 5G end to end, not just about one point, not just about the modem and the handset or about something that goes into a cell tower ... this is about making sure that we have a system that supports the rise of all these machines over the next decade,\" he told ZDNet."]}, "Google": {"2017-09-28": ["Google has just updated the language of the support page where software update policies for Nexus and GPE devices are summarized, and the new text is not exactly encouraging on first read. The following clause, regarding carriers, was added:\n\nBased on your carrier, it may take longer than two weeks after release to get an update.\n\nWe do not know if this is merely a safety net to avoid the ire of customers in the case of things like the Nexus 7 2013 LTE and the whole Verizon debacle, or if this is actually a forward-looking change in policy that could affect new devices like the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE. The same language was also added to the section for Google Play Edition devices.\n\nLet me be clear: anything beyond this point is, by necessity, speculation. We do not know why Google changed the language in this document or how it intends to act based upon that language, if at all. But we can take a stab at it.\n\nOne technical point very much worth making here is that even in the event one of the carriers does withhold an update to a Nexus or GPE device (say, based on the installed SIM card or MDN), there's nothing they can do to stop you from sideloading an update package or flashing a factory image yourself. Carriers flat out cannot control whether or not you will be physically able to update your device, because once the files are out there, anyone can use them. A Nexus 6 is a Nexus 6 is a Nexus 6 (and a Nexus 5 / 7 LTE / 9 LTE etc.) as far as the firmware is concerned. So no, AT&T and Verizon won't be able to fully stop your Nexus from getting an update unless they stop all Nexus devices the world over from getting the update, and this basically seems very unlikely.\n\nWhat they can do, though, is withhold over-the-air distribution of a software update to their customers (regardless of whether you bought the Nexus 6 from the carrier, Google, or Motorola). The most likely way such a scenario would play out is if the carrier spots an issue in its own testing of the update before it goes live. If Verizon finds an issue with a new Nexus 6 build, for example, that breaks the MyVerizon app or something, Verizon could tell Google to hold the update for Verizon SIMs/MDNs/IMEIs/whatever until the issue is fixed, and if it's an OS issue, a new build then distributed (which would go to all devices, not just Verizon's).\n\nIf such a scenario were to play out, Verizon users wouldn't truly be \"stuck,\" though, so long as the OTA actually gets released somewhere. After finding the OTA link, Verizon users would be able to flash an update without issue. Or, if Google were to post a factory image file for an update, Verizon customers would be free to utilize that as well. The only thing Verizon can do is suspend OTA distribution of the update to people on its network.\n\nFrom a QA standpoint, this is probably a good thing overall, because no one wants to end up with an update that in some capacity breaks their phone or tablet. It's also probably a compromise Google has made with carriers in the US (and possibly elsewhere) to encourage them to sell Nexus phones while still allowing Google overall control of the software and update process.\n\nSo, in all likelihood, this new wording refers to a change in policy that probably won't do anything more than cause you minor inconvenience, should Google ever have to resort to putting a hold on an OTA for a certain carrier. It could be a nuisance if a particular carrier becomes notorious for constantly delaying OTA distribution (COUGH VERIZON/AT&T) and users are perpetually having to sideload updates on their own, but it would be just that: a nuisance.", "Rick Pitino began his career under suspicion.

Both panels are investigating the scope of alleged Kremlin interference in the U.S. election, a charge Moscow has denied.\n\nTwitter did not respond when asked about the briefings.\n\nThe intelligence committees on Wednesday asked executives from technology companies including Facebook , Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter, to testify at a public hearing on Nov. 1 about alleged Russian interference.\n\nThe pressure on the companies reflects growing concern among lawmakers in both parties that social networks may have played a key role in Moscow's attempts to spread disinformation and propaganda to sow political discord in the United States and help elect President Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook disclosed this month that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is leading efforts to introduce legislation requiring internet platforms to reveal who is purchasing online political ads, which would bring them in line with rules governing ads on radio or television.\n\nWarner told reporters on Thursday he did not have a Republican co-sponsor for a draft measure he was circulating, but said he was confident there would be bipartisan interest.\n\nHe said his bill would have a \"self-regulatory effect\" on buyers of political ads because \"if you're going to call someone something that is totally unfounded ... you would have to stand the scrutiny of actually being examined.\"\n\nWarner said he had not yet received some 3,000 ads from Facebook suspected of being bought by Russia but that he expected they would be delivered on Friday or Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenballand Peter Cooney)\n\nLike what you're reading?\n\nWe make it easy to stay connected:\n\nFollow @TwitterDev Subscribe to our email newsletters Download our free apps Your next Nation & World articles Hugh Hefner, Playboy Founder, dies at 91 U.S. student held in North Korea died of ...

Her family lived in an abandoned gas station for more than two years. Nick Oza/azcentral.com | The Republic\n\n1220 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nU.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is running for the Senate seat held by Jeff Flake, ending months of speculation about her political future and giving Democrats a top-tier fundraiser with experience on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn a video announcing her bid,the Arizona Democrat recounts her upbringing in a family that fell from the middle class into homelessness. She made her way to Congress, Sinema says, with hard work and help from \"family, church and, sometimes, even the government.\"\n\n\"I really feel like I have a duty to serve and give back to this country, which has given so much to me,\" she said in an interview with The Arizona Republic. \"Working hard is all I know; it's who I am. I believe I'll be the hardest worker for Arizonans in the United States Senate.\"\n\nSinema, who has a reputation as an energetic problem-solver not focused on partisanship, said she intends to make her work on behalf of military veterans and cutting regulatory red tape for businesses core issues of her campaign.\n\n\"Our nation is facing a lot of problems right now, but we can fix these problems if we work together,\" Sinema says in the video. \"It's time to put our country ahead of party, ahead of politics. It's time to stop fighting and look for common ground.\"\n\nThe announcement echoes her frequent lament that \"Washington is broken.\" But she also brings a relatively slender list of legislative accomplishments in Congress, where gridlock has dominated since Sinema first won her House seat in 2012.\n\nFlake campaign spokesman Will Allison cast Sinema as too liberal for Arizona.\n\n\"From her time working on Ralph Nader's campaign to the state legislature to Congress, Kyrsten Sinema has always been out-of-touch with Arizona and she'll do anything to hide her progressive record,\" Allison said in a written statement.\n\nA seat in Democrats' sights\n\nShe has set her sights on unseating Flake, who is already battling former state Sen. Kelli Ward for the Republican nomination and trailing the GOP challenger in recent polls. But before that, Sinema faces attorney and community activist Deedra Abboud in the race for the Democratic nomination, as well as political unknowns Jim Moss of Globe and Richard Sherzan of Mesa.\n\nArizona Democrats, who haven't won a Senate race since 1988, will have to choose between candidates like Abboud, a novice whoembraces progressive policies, and Sinema, who has won three terms in the House, in part by working with Republicans.\n\nDemocrats nationally see Flake's seat as a key opportunity in an otherwise dreary Senate map for the left in 2018.\n\nSinema is among the top fundraisers in the House, adding new financial pressure to Flake.\n\nWith Sinema vacating her congressional seat, the 9th District is expected to see more Republicans pursuing a seat that is considered competitive on paper but has been hers alone since it was created.\n\nOne recent poll suggests she could win the Senate seat. Phoenix Republican consulting firm HighGround Public Affairs found Ward leading Flake by 14 percentage points in the GOP primary and Sinema leading Flake by 8 percentage points in a general election matchup.\n\nIt's a political squeeze similar to the one Sen. John McCain faced in 2015, when he battled Ward to his right and then-U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, another moderate Democrat, whom he soundly defeated last year.\n\nOpposed 'Obamacare' repeal\n\nSo far this year, Sinema has voted in line with the Trump administration's known preferences 49 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. By that measure, she is the third-most GOP-friendly Democrat so far this year.\n\nBy contrast, Flake has voted with the administration 92 percent of the time. Seven of the other 51 Republicans in the Senate have lower marks, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\nHer proudest legislative accomplishment to date is passage last year of a measure to require the VA to accommodate veterans needing mental health assistance, even if their work involved classified information that needs special handling. It is named for Daniel Somers, a Phoenix Iraq War veteran who said he killed himself after hitting roadblocks with the VA.\n\nSEE ALSO: The congresswoman who grew up in a gas station\n\nSome Democrats have complained that Sinema has been too eager to support law enforcement bills that would make life more difficult for immigrants. At the same time, she has been outspoken in her support of \"dreamers,\" immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\n\nWhile Sinema has frequently supported the current GOP agenda, she did not vote for the health care reforms that are arguably the most divisive and high-profile legislation of the Trump era.\n\nSinema has made reforms for the VA hospitals and improved economic opportunities for those with military ties a centerpiece of her time in Congress, though the hospital system remains in a state of upheaval three years after The Arizona Republic uncovered widespread problems in Phoenix.\n\nEarlier this month, Sinema met with President Donald Trump as part of a bipartisan group of House moderates seeking common ground on issues ranging from accommodating \"dreamers,\" and enacting temporary measures to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, to sweeping tax changes. Such bipartisan meetings have become a rarity in Washington and her presence speaks to Sinema's reputation as a Democrat that Republicans can work with.\n\nSinema co-sponsored this year a bill to better connect business startups with investors by cutting regulatory requirements. That measure is pending in the Senate. A member of the House Financial Services Committee, she is generally supportive of cutting taxes and of the kind of public-private infrastructure plan sketched out by the Trump administration, though she also cites concerns about the government's growing national debt.\n\nTALKING POLITICS: Listen to our Arizona politics podcast, The Gaggle, on Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud, Stitcher or Google Play.\n\nBipartisan reputation\n\nSinema has occasionally frustrated Democrats with what she sees as a need for moderation. She has declined to vote for Nancy Pelosi as her party's leader in the House. She also skipped a Tempe rally for Hillary Clinton at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nShe is friendly with Republicans in the House, including Arizonans like former Rep. Matt Salmon and his successor, Rep. Andy Biggs, both of whom are among the most conservative members of the GOP.\n\nSinema frequently cosponsors Republican bills, enough to make her the third-most bipartisan member of the House and the fourth-most conservative Democrat in the Congress that ended in 2016, according to GovTrack, a nonpartisan organization that monitors congressional activity. She was near the bottom of House sophomores at attracting influential cosponsors to her own bills, GovTrack found.\n\nSinema's bipartisanship extends to social media, where she routinely passes along birthday wishes to colleagues in both parties.\n\nBut the National Republican Senatorial Committee signaled in a statement Thursday that Republicans will attempt to cast Sinema as \"extreme.\"\n\n\"Kyrsten Sinema has more in common with the failed, radical leadership of Nancy Pelosi than she does with Arizonan families, and her track record of voting in lockstep with Washington Democrats will haunt her uphill campaign for Senate,\" NRSC Communications Director Katie Martin said in a statement.\n\nA prolific fundraiser\n\nOne thing that is not expected to be a problem for Sinema is money.\n\nShe is one of the more prolific fundraisers in Washington. Through June she had amassed $3.2 million in campaign cash, which was one of the largest sums in the House and topped the $3 million that Flake had raised by then.\n\nHer fundraising at least briefly posed a problem earlier this year when The Republic noted she accepted contributions from the embattled founders of Backpage.com, a website accused of knowingly accepting ads offering sex with underage girls.\n\nSinema eventually gave the money, about $53,000, to a charity to combat sexual abuse, but only after other charities rejected what they viewed as tainted cash.\n\nFlake and McCain helped keep pressure on Backpage this summer by introducing a bill to make it easier to prosecute online publishers aiding in sex trafficking.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSETHE GAGGLE: TALKING POLITICS EVERY WEEK WITH THE AZCENTRAL.COM TEAM The Gaggle: Russia hack, another ACA repeal | 4:56\n\nThe Republic's political team talks about President DonalTrump blaming Sen.

Today (Sept. 28) we get acquainted with two new versions of the Echo as well as two other new devices that joined the family.\n\nAvailable today is the second generation of the Amazon Echo, which features a new second generation far-field microphones for improved and accurate voice recognition, a redesigned body and six different variations to match your home decor.\n\nThe new Echo is also very affordable starting at only $100, a nice alternative to the $129 Google Home.\n\nIf you want to pair Echos throughout your home, Amazon even offers a three pack for $250 ($50 off).\n\nCan't beat that.\n\nFor those who want an upgraded version of the standard Echo, Amazon has you covered with the Echo Plus. The Echo Plus keeps the look of the original (it comes in three colors) but has plenty of new features such as full-on smart home hub functionality, Zigbee support, improved speakers that include a tweeter and woofer promising improved sound.\n\nThe Echo Plus will cost only $150 and comes with a Phillips Hue white bulb to help kickoff your smart home renovation.\n\nWait there's more, Amazon also is bringing to your home the Amazon Spot. The spot serves as a much better version of the Amazon Dot. It features a circular 2.5 inch screen, Bluetooth, and audio jack for speaker connectivity.\n\nDesigned to fit anywhere in your home, the Spot can also control your smart home, uses far-field voice recognition, allows you to watch video, and make hands-free voice or video calls, weather reports, to-do lists and browse and listen to audible books and more. All for a reasonable $129 price point.\n\nLast but not least is the Amazon Connect which serves as an Alexa powered speaker for those who still use a landline phone. The connect plugs directly into your landline giving users a new and easy way to make and receive phone calls.\n\nThe Connect only cost's $35 dollars and serves as the perfect gift for your parents who refuse to get an Echo.\n\nAll of the new Echo devices are always connected and updates are delivered automatically. Amazon also promises Alexa gets smarter the more you use your Echo as it continually adapts to your vocabulary, speech patterns, and personal preferences.", "TWITTER FOUND 200 ACCOUNTS LINKED TO RUSSIAN INFLUENCE EFFORT: Twitter announced on Thursday that it found 201 accounts on its platform linked to potential Russian interference in the 2016 election on its platform.\n\nThe company said that 22 of the accounts were linked to Facebook pages and profiles that Facebook had turned over as a part of its analysis of foreign influence on its social media platform. Twitter noted that it immediately deleted the linked accounts that were not already suspended.\n\nBut it's not clear how many Twitter accounts not linked to Russian-tied Facebook accounts could also be connected to Russian election influence.\n\nTwitter said that of the remaining 179 accounts, it \"took action on the ones we found in violation of our rules.\"\n\nNone of the 201 accounts were registered as advertisers on Twitter, according to the company.\n\nTwitter also shared that Russia Today, a Russian propaganda news outlet that distributes content in the U.S. and other countries, had used the platform to buy advertisements targeted to U.S. markets in 2016. Three RT accounts, @RT_com, @RT_America, and @ActualidadRT, purchased $274,100 ads on Twitter.\n\nThe money went towards 1,823 promoted tweets, \"directed at followers of mainstream media,\" Twitter's public policy team said.\n\nTwitter met with Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Thursday to brief lawmakers and staff on the company's findings in regard to potential election interference by foreign actors.\n\n...

Researchers culled the information from 22,117,221 tweets collected between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11.\n\nFACEBOOK PULLED INTO NEW CULTURE WAR: President Trump's Wednesday attack on Facebook threatens to pull the social media giant back into the culture war.\n\nTrump's barrage, launched in a series of tweets, comes a year after Facebook found itself embroiled in controversy over how its newsfeed editors treated conservative media. And it coincides with the ongoing congressional investigations into Russian influence, which have raised questions about whether Kremlin-linked actors used Facebook to influence the election.\n\n\"Facebook was always anti-Trump,\" Trump wrote in a tweet Wednesday morning. \"The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump.

As reported by the Inquisitr, Melania already repeated the Michael Kors baby blue sheath dress on Wednesday that Melania previously wore in June. That was allegedly the same $1,695 Stretch Boucl\u00e9-Crepe Sheath Dress that Melania wore in June that sparked a whole bunch of Google searches from people asking if Melania was pregnant. A photo of Melania purportedly wearing the same dress again in New York City on Wednesday, September 27, can be seen in a Vogue article titled, \"Melania Trump Repeats a Michael Kors Sheath Dress in New York City.\" In that photo, Melania wears a cream jacket atop the dress, so it is hard to tell if the same signature buttons line the hip area.\n\nOn Thursday, September 28, it appears Melania reached back into her large closet to pull out another outfit she already owned, instead of ordering more wardrobe boxes full of clothing that Melania used to have delivered to Trump Tower. Melania hosted a meeting at the White House dubbed a listening session on the serious opioid crisis, so Melania sat with others in the State Dining Room wearing a black suit as she heard from recovering drug addicts, healthcare workers and from the parents of children who overdosed.\n\nAs seen in close-up photos of Melania at the meeting, Melania wore a black jacket with white stitching running all along the lapel. The black jacket has a distinctive cut and look, and appears to be the same jacket that Melania wore on Wednesday, July 12, pictured in the top photo above, when Melania donned a black Escada pant suit on her journey to Paris with President Trump, as reported by Vogue.\n\nAlthough Melania paired the black jacket back in July with a plain white shirt, as reported by the Express, Melania switched into a more sober-minded and serious white button-down shirt for the White House meeting, even though the buttons appear to be hidden. Photos from the White House meeting do not show if Melania paired the same fit-and-flare pants that she wore with the black jacket previously, but with Melania pointedly repeating her much-discussed outfits, Melania could be trying to send a message to the public that she might be cutting back on her designer shopping habits. Time - and more repeated outfits - will tell the tale.", "Image: Apple\n\nDespite investing heavily in hardware and revising the operating system, the Apple Watch is losing apps from high profile businesses. This week, Twitter joined the exodus with Google, Amazon, Target, TripAdvisor abandoning the platform recently. Why is this?\n\nUnlike the iPhone and iPad, which resolved usability issues, the Apple Watch has never had the same obvious use-case. The main use-cases for smartwatches have centred on notifications and health. But, if you're anything like me, the first thing you do when setting up a smart watch is to turn off a bunch of notifications. Otherwise you end up with your wrist pinging and vibrating constantly.\n\nWhen you look at the apps that are being killed off, they are primarily focussed on notifications that are duplicating functionality that already exists on other devices. Why would I want my watch to tell me something that I can get on my smartphone more with greater clarity and easier interactivity?\n\nI suspect this is why Apple is investing in longer-term platform plays such as HealthKit and ResearchKit. We can see some of what Apple is planning through enhancements in watchOS 4 such as alerts when your heart rate falls outside certain limits in specific circumstances.\n\nThe developers that are leaving the watchOS platform weren't adding any real value to users. So, it's not surprising that the apps are either not being downloaded or, once installed, rarely used. The developers that are creating popular watch apps are rethinking what an app needs to be.\n\nRather than just mimic notifications, they do on-board processing within the watch to deliver useful massaging. Or they do something on the watch that is more convenient on your wrist than on a smartphone.\n\nI expect the number of notification-based smartphone apps for the Apple Watch and other platforms to slowly fall. But, over time, I suspect apps that offer more value to users will evolve.\n\nWATCH MORE: Tech News", "By Dustin Volz and Joseph Menn\n\nWASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Twitter said on Thursday it had suspended about 200 Russian-linked accounts as it probes online efforts to meddle with the 2016 U.S. election, but an influential Democratic senator slammed its steps as insufficient.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, summoned Twitter officials to testify behind closed doors on Thursday as part of broad investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election. Facebook faced a similar grilling earlier this month.\n\nLawmakers in both parties suspect social networks may have played a big role in Moscow's attempts to spread propaganda, sow political discord in the United States and help elect President Donald Trump. Moscow denies any such activity, and Trump has denied any collusion.\n\nTwitter also briefed the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nWarner said Twitter officials had not answered many questions about Russian use of the platform and that it was still subject to foreign manipulation.\n\nThe company's presentation to the Intelligence Committee \"showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is,\" Warner said. He took particular umbrage at what he said was Twitter's decision to largely confine its review to accounts linked to fake profiles already spotted by Facebook.\n\nTwitter said it had identified and removed 22 accounts directly linked to about 500 fake Facebook pages or profiles tied to Russia and that it unearthed an additional 179 accounts that were otherwise related.\n\nTwitter declined to comment when asked about Warner's comments.\n\nIn addition to the private testimony by its officials, the company published a public blog post Thursday with its most detailed discussion to date of the steps it was taking to combat propaganda.\n\nWarner in remarks to reporters called Twitter's statements \"deeply disappointing\" and \"inadequate on almost every level.\"\n\nThe comments signaled that the congressional investigations into Russia's use of social media platforms would not ease up. Twitter, Facebook and other Internet companies including Alphabet Inc's Google are facing a steady stream of criticism as more information emerges about manipulation of their platforms during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nUsers, lawmakers and technology analysts have long criticized Twitter as too lax in policing fake or abusive accounts. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows both anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making it far more difficult to police the service.\n\nOn Thursday, researchers at Oxford University published a study concluding that Twitter bots disseminated misinformation and propaganda at a higher rate in U.S. battleground states than in noncompetitive states during a 10-day period around Election Day in November.\n\nSan Francisco-based Twitter said Russian media outlet Russia Today, which is close to the Kremlin, had spent $274,100 on Twitter advertisements and promoted 1,823 tweets potentially aimed at the U.S. market.\n\nThose ad buys alone topped the $100,000 that Facebook this month linked to a Russian propaganda operation during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was more tempered in his assessment of Twitter's briefing, saying in a statement that the firm expressed a desire to work cooperatively with investigators and conduct additional analyses.\n\n'LOW-QUALITY TWEETS'\n\nTwitter announced new measures to toughen restrictions on suspect spammers, for example by reducing the time that suspicious accounts stay visible during company investigations.\n\nTo thwart abuse via applications interacting with Twitter, the company said it had suspended 117,000 apps since June that had been responsible for 1.5 billion \"low-quality\" tweets this year.\n\nTwitter said it wanted to strengthen disclosure rules on political advertising, as Facebook has just done.\n\nWarner is leading efforts to introduce legislation requiring internet platforms to reveal who is purchasing online political ads, which would bring them in line with rules governing ads on radio or television.\n\nHe told reporters on Thursday he did not have a Republican co-sponsor for a draft measure he was circulating he was confident there would be bipartisan interest.

It was one of the first to support 4K HDR streaming, for instance,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nMost set-top boxes typically have the minimum performance needed to do the job, and that can lead to frame drops and voice cut outs, Enderle noted.\n\nThe other distinguishing feature for Shield TV has been its ability to act as a PC-lite game console. That could help it break out, even if it does make it more of a niche product in a crowded marketplace.\n\n\"While some, like Fire TV, do games, they don't do them particularly well -- and this is where Shield TV tends to shine,\" Enderle said.\n\n\"Where it did lag was with voice control. It had it, but it lagged the Fire TV in experience, so moving to the Google Assistant should close this gap,\" he suggested.\n\n\"For those willing to pay a bit extra for a higher level of performance, and particularly for those that want to either play PC games streamed from their PC or have a better Android gaming experience, this is the solution they'll likely prefer,\" Enderle said.\n\nThe latest updates to the product should be welcome to its hardcore users, even if that customer base is somewhat limited.\n\n\"It looks like a solid upgrade,\" said Roger Kay, principal analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates.\n\n\"It will be well received, but I'm not sure how many people actually use Shield TV,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\n\"The target market is tiny -- gamers who are interested in playing via streaming media set-top box rather than investing in a game console -- and the set-top box, streaming media space is incredibly crowded,\" said Josh Crandall, principal analyst at Netpop Research.\n\nHow some of the functionality is meant to be used could be another factor influencing its appeal.\n\n\"Virtual assistants need to live in the kitchen, not the living room,\" said Joel Espelien, senior analyst at TDG.\n\n\"People don't want to yell across the room at the assistant,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nEven with its limited appeal for those who already are sold on it, \"this upgrade extends the functionality substantially,\" noted Kay.\n\nHowever, \"the real story here is happening behind the scenes,\" Crandall told TechNewsWorld. \"It's the competition between Google and Amazon -- so pulling YouTube from Amazon's Echo Show is a sign that Google is concerned about how integrated Amazon has become in people's world of entertainment, in addition to commerce.\"\n\nPeter Suciu has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2012.

The campaign, targeted to Oregon Senate District 11, is organized under the phrase \"Enough Courtney,\" and repeats an image of Salem's Democratic senator with a red circle and line over his face.\n\n\"The National Popular Vote bill passed the Oregon House in 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017, but was killed in the Senate because of the opposition of State Senate President Peter Courtney,\" John Koza, chairman of the non-partisan National Popular Vote, said in a statement.\n\nThe point of the campaign, Koza said, is to educate voters of that fact.\n\nCourtney, meanwhile, says he supports putting the popular vote proposal in front of Oregon's voters, a change from his position before the most recent election cycle.\n\n\"If you believe in the popular vote, then let the popular vote decide the issue. I've made it clear that I would support putting the issue on the ballot,\" Courtney said in a statement. \"If a bill to put the National Popular Vote Compact to a vote of the people comes out of committee in 2018, I'll vote for it.\"\n\nKoza called that \"an excuse\" that Courtney just came up with.\n\nMore politics coverage: Here are some of the dozens of new Oregon laws taking effect next week\n\nThe nearly identical pieces of legislation introduced over the years would have added Oregon to a growing group of states that pledge to award their electoral college votes to the winner of the national popular vote.\n\nCurrently, states attached to the agreement add up to 165 electoral votes, but the law is only triggered once that number hits 270. A presidential candidate needs to receive at least 270 electoral votes to be elected to the nation's highest office.\n\nProponents of the popular vote model say it's more fair -- each person gets one vote, as opposed to the current system which under-represents people in more populous states. The change would also require candidates to campaign in more states, they say. In the 2016 election, the vast majority of campaigning was confined to so-called \"battleground\" states, in part, because of their electoral college significance.\n\nOpponents, however, say the popular vote system would lead to rural areas getting overlooked as candidates, seeking to maximize their time and money, focus on areas with more people.\n\nMore elections coverage: Oregon Gov.

But the social network has also produced unintended social consequences - and they're starting to catch up with it:\n\n* House and Senate panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections have invited Facebook - along with Google and Twitter - to testify this fall . Facebook just agreed to give congressional investigators 3,000 political ads purchased by Russian-backed entities, and announced new disclosure policies for political advertising\n\n* Facebook belatedly acknowledged its role purveying false news to its users during the 2016 campaign and announced new measures to curb it. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg even just apologised - more than 10 months after the fact - for calling the idea that Facebook might have influenced the election \"pretty crazy.\"\n\n* The company has taken flak for a live video feature that was quickly used to broadcast violent crime and suicides; for removing an iconic Vietnam War photo for \"child pornography\" and then backtracking; and for allegedly putting its thumb on a feature that ranked trending news stories .\n\nFacebook is behind the curve in understanding that \"what happens in their system has profound consequences in the real world,\" said Fordham University media-studies professor Paul Levinson. The company's knee-jerk response has often been \"none of your business\" when confronted about these consequences, he said.\n\nWhen such issues arise, Facebook generally restricts itself to bland assertions that its policies prohibit misuse of its platform and that it's difficult to catch everyone who tries to abuse its platform. When pressed, it tends to acknowledge some problems, offer a few narrowly tailored fixes - and move on.\n\nBut there is a larger question the company hasn't addressed direction: Has Facebook has taken sufficient care to build policies and systems that are resistant to abuse?\n\nFacebook declined to address the subject on the record, although it pointed to earlier public statements in which Zuckerberg described how he wants Facebook to be a force for good in the world. The company also recently launched a blog called \"Hard Questions \" that attempts to address its governance issues in more depth.\n\nBut Sheryl Sandberg, the company's No. 2 executive, has suggested that Facebook has work to do on this front. In a recent apology , she wrote that Facebook \"never intended or anticipated\" that people could use its automated advertising to target ads at \"Jew haters\" - that is, users who expressed anti-Semitic views in the Facebook profiles.\n\nThat, she wrote, \"is on us. And we did not find it ourselves - and that is also on us.\"\n\nFacebook's often unresponsive response to crisis may not work much longer for a company that sometimes still seems to hew to its now-abandoned slogan - \"move fast and break things.\"\n\nFacebook has so far enjoyed seemingly unstoppable growth in users, revenue and its stock price. But along the way, it has also pushed new features on to users even when they protested, targeted ads at them based on a plethora of carefully collected personal details, and even engaged in behavioral experiments that seek to influence their mood.\n\nHow it got here has to do with its exceptionalist company culture, a hands-off approach that values free speech over monitoring what its users post, and the fact that no matter how many people it hires, it will always have what amounts to a skeleton crew to deal with its huge user base.\n\n\"There's a general arrogance - they know what's right, they know what's best, we know how to make better for you so just let us do it,\" said Notre Dame business professor Timothy Carone, who added that this is true of Silicon Valley giants in general. \"They need to take a step down and acknowledge that they really don't have all the answers.\"\n\nFacebook depends on signing up as many users as possible - and pulling in as many advertising dollars as possible - to run its business. Its systems for signing up and for buying ads are both highly automated, a fact that makes the company both efficient and highly profitable.\n\nIn the first six months of 2017 , Facebook pulled in sales of more than US$17 billion and reported a profit of almost US$7b.\n\nIt also helps explain not only why Facebook can seem so disengaged from its controversies, but also why it's vulnerable in the first place, said David Gerzof Richard, a communications professor at Emerson College.\n\nRussia, for instance, was able to exploit \"the capitalist nature of what motivates Facebook,\" Gerzof Richard said. If the company was truly focused on the \"content, message and quality of ads,\" he said, \"there would be a very different platform for how you buy and place ads on Facebook.\"\n\nGerzof Richard thinks Facebook should view the \"social hacking\" of its platform - that is, the unintended uses that spring from human nature - much the way it has looks at technological challenges such as spam and data breaches.\n\nFacebook already gives out \"bug bounties\" - that is, prizes for people who find technical flaws in its platform. Why not do the same for oversights that allow social hacks of its ad system, user newsfeeds and the like?\n\n\"We as a species are very, very inventive,\" Gerzof Richard said. \"You give someone a power tool and they will figure out ways to use it that the maker has never intended.\"", "Hot off his recent vacation, Magisk developer topjohnwu has released a beta version of Magisk (v14.1) that works with the Pixel phones.

Despite Twitter's efforts at transparency, the senior Democrat on the Senate panel left the meeting unhappy.\n\nTwitter's Vice President for Public Policy Colin Crowell met with with members of the House and Senate intelligence committees on Thursday, discussing the allegations that Russia had abused the platform to somehow interfere in the US electoral process.\n\nAfter being asked to look into 450 accounts that Facebook flagged as fake and \"suspected\" Russian bots earlier this month, Twitter found 22 corresponding accounts on their platform and suspended them for violating the company's rules against spam. Twitter also suspended another 179 \"related or linked accounts\" that were in violation of their terms of service. None of the 201 accounts were registered as advertisers, the company said.\n\n\"Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, which is a cornerstone for all democracies. We will continue to strengthen Twitter against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam, as well as other activities that violate our Terms of Service,\"Twitter said.\n\nPart of the revelations to Congress was that RT, RT America and RT en Espa\u00f1ol spent $274,100 for 1,823 US ads for their respective Twitter accounts that \"definitely or potentially targeted the US market.\"\n\nRT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan said that she wasn't aware paying for advertising is now considered suspicious or harmful in a developed democracy such as the United States.\n\n\"This is forcing us to go a step further and come clean that we also spent money on advertising at airports, in taxis, on billboards, on the Internet, on TV and radio. Even CNN ran our commercials,\" Simonyan said. \"By the way, similar campaigns are conducted by the American media in the Russian segment of Twitter. It'll be very interesting to find out how much they spend on it, who they target and for what purpose.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Twitter said they deleted thousands of tweets and accounts that attempted to \"suppress or otherwise interfere with the exercise of voting rights, including the right to have a vote counted, by circulating intentionally misleading information.\"\n\nThis included tweets that told users they could cast their ballots by text or tweet, which is not true. The company posted tweets to offset these messages, informing users about their local polling places, and providing them with detailed information on each of the candidates.\n\nTwitter also said that they shared the content of deleted tweets with investigators on Thursday. The company added that they did not find any of those accounts had \"obvious Russian origin.\"\n\n\"We have not found accounts associated with this activity to have obvious Russian origin but some of the accounts appear to have been automated,\" the company wrote.\n\nEvery week, Twitter said their automated systems catch more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts. The company blamed Russia for being the \"primary source of automated and spammy content on Twitter for many years,\" but did not provide any evidence of that claim.\n\nThough Twitter promised to work with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and Congress on making the social media platform more transparent, this was apparently not good enough for Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nWarner Twitter after the meeting, saying their presentation was \"frankly inadequate on almost every level,\" according to CBS News.\n\n\"The notion that their work was basically derivative, based upon accounts that Facebook had identified, showed [an] enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions, and again begs many more questions than they offered,\" Warner said, adding that the American public had the right to know if any ads that appear on Twitter's newsfeed were \"generated by interests from Americans or generated by interests from, by activities of foreign powers.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook said that it had identified up to $150,000 in advertising, purchased between June 2015 and May 2017, that was connected to roughly 470 \"inauthentic\" accounts and pages that were \"likely operated out of Russia,\" Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos wrote.\n\nStamos admitted that the \"vast majority of ads run by these accounts\" had nothing to do with the election, voting, or a particular candidate.\n\nGoogle said it had failed to unearth any facts that would implicate Moscow in exploiting advertising to manipulate the election.\n\n\"We're always monitoring for abuse or violations of our policies and we've seen no evidence this type of ad campaign was run on our platforms,\" Google said last week, according to Reuters.\n\nThe House and Senate Intelligence Committees have invited Facebook, Google and Twitter executives to testify before Congress on Russia and the 2016 election.

Electronics manufacturer Huawei, which is primarily known for phones but is expanding to wearables, tablets, and now laptops, also caught Sorrell's eye.\n\nThe size of Huawei's Shenzhen workforce, around 200,000 people, is noteworthy; as is that of Alibaba - around 15,000.\n\nSorrell also believes the era of cheap copycat products is over. \"We think they steal technology? Well they may have done a few years ago. We could have said the same thing about the Japanese, the same thing about the Hong Kong Chinese and the South Koreans.\"\n\nFor the time being, the competition remains in Asian markets, but Sorrell believes it is a precursor of a larger trend to come. He noted the \"head-to-head battle\" between the Alibaba-owned Lazada platform and America's Amazon in Singapore. \"It's going to be very interesting to see who wins.\n\n\"They will start to penetrate the south east Asian markets, India and places like that and sweep that way, just like from a foreign policy point of view they swept that way and into Africa.\"\n\nSourced from Mumbrella; additional content by WARC staff", "Image: Google\n\nEven though it feels like we're still processing all of Apple's latest devices and announcements, it's time to switch gears and prepare for what's coming on the other side of of the smartphone divide.

With the digital assistant wars in full swing, Google's best shot at countering all of the new Echo devices that Amazon just announced and stuff like the Siri-powered Apple Homepod is to put the Google Assistant in as many products and devices as it can.\n\nThere's also a chance we hear more or even get a released date for Google Lens, which is Google's visual recognition tech that can help you identify things like the species of a flower just by pointing your phone's camera at it.

The shares rocketed almost 68 percent Thursday, closing the day at their peak of $23.50.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is known for its boxes and sticks that let users watch Netflix, Hulu and the growing universe of streaming-video options on their TVs. It has the biggest share of the streaming-gadget market, but has deep-pocketed competitors in Amazon, Google and Apple.\n\nMost of Roku's revenue comes from sales of its streaming players, but it's seeking to capitalize on its \"platform\" by building its business of showing ads to users, whether on its home screen or inside video apps.\n\nThe company is unprofitable and has amassed $244 million in losses since it was founded in 2002.\n\nNo assembly required? Ikea to buy services site TaskRabbit\n\nNEW YORK -- Ikea is making moves so you don't have to assemble a sofa or bookcase yourself.\n\nThe furniture seller said Thursday that it is buying online on-demand services platform TaskRabbit, which lets users hire people to help them move, clean up the house or assemble furniture. Much of Ikea's furniture requires customers to screw together table legs, bed frames and dining room chairs.\n\nIkea said it tested TaskRabbit in its stores in London last year and plans to roll out the service in U.S. stores and more U.K. locations. More countries may be added later. Before the TaskRabbit deal, certain Ikea stores already provided some independent workers to assemble goods.\n\nIkea said it expects the deal to be completed next month, and that TaskRabbit will remain an independent company and stay based in San Francisco.

But growth is expected to slow sharply this quarter in the wake of a string of devastating hurricanes.\n\nThe April-June expansion in the gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services -- is up slightly from a 3 percent estimate made a month ago, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It is the strongest performance since the economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2015. The upward revision reflected larger farm stockpiles.\n\nThe year started with a lackluster 1.2 percent gain in the first quarter. Economists believe growth has slowed again to around 2 percent in the current quarter.\n\nThe revised figure was the government's third and final look at GDP for the April-June period, and left GDP rising at an average 2 percent pace over the first six months of the year. That matches the lackluster average annual growth rates seen since the recovery from the Great Recession began in mid-2009.\n\nAnalysts have been busy trimming their forecasts for the current July-September quarter to reflect the adverse effects of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that have hit in recent weeks. But many are optimistic that growth will bounce back quickly as rebuilding gets underway.\n\n-- From wire reports", "WASHINGTON -- Social media giant Twitter told congressional investigators Thursday it has suspended at least two dozen accounts that may have been tied to Russia, but the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee was anything but satisfied.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner said Twitter's explanations of its actions against Russia-linked accounts were \"deeply disappointing,\" and he suggested the company doesn't understand the seriousness of Congress' investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Warner made the comments after company executives met behind closed doors with staff members of both the Senate and House intelligence committees for several hours.\n\nWarner said that the information Twitter shared \"was frankly inadequate on almost every level.\"\n\nThe disclosures by Twitter follow Facebook revelations that some 3,000 ads were purchased by entities with likely ties to Russia and as congressional investigators are examining the spread of false news stories and propaganda on social media during the campaign.\n\nThe committees have been investigating Russia's election meddling and any possible co-ordination with associates of Republican Donald Trump in his campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They have specifically been looking at Twitter and Facebook and their roles in the spread of misinformation and propaganda during the campaign.\n\nThe company said in a blog post that it found 22 accounts corresponding to about 450 Facebook accounts that were likely operated out of Russia and pushed divisive social and political issues during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook has said those accounts were responsible for buying about 3,000 ads.\n\nTwitter says it also found an additional 179 related accounts and took action against ones that violated its rules. The company didn't specific how many of those accounts were suspended or the type of action taken. A person familiar with Twitter's response to the accounts says that most of those accounts were found to have violated the platform's rules. The person did not know if all 179 had been suspended from the service. The person spoke only on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the information publicly.\n\nWarner said that Twitter's findings were merely \"derivative\" of Facebook's work, and \"showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.\"\n\nHe said the meeting underscored the need for the company to come forward in a public hearing. Both the House and Senate intelligence panels are inviting Twitter, Facebook and Google to testify this fall.\n\nThursday's closed meetings lasted several hours. The company's executives included Colin Crowell, a vice-president of public policy, government and corporate philanthropy; Carlos Monje, director of public policy and philanthropy; attorney Elizabeth Banker, and Emily Horne, global policy communications director.\n\nTwitter said it also provided congressional investigators with a \"roundup\" of ads from accounts used by Russia's state-sponsored news network, RT. The company said in a blog post that RT spent $274,100 on ads targeted to markets in the U.S. during 2016. Twitter provided the ads, which came from three handles used by RT, to the congressional investigators. Most tweets from the accounts promoted news stories.\n\nIn its blog post, Twitter said it has worked harder to detect and prevent spam and \"malicious automation.\" The company said it removed tweets that were attempting to suppress legitimate votes by telling people they could vote for Clinton by texting. The company said that its automated systems catch more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts globally per week, which is more than double the amount the company detected this time last year.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, showed less frustration after his own panel's staff was briefed by Twitter, saying the meeting was \"good but preliminary.\"\n\n\"I think there are challenges to Twitter in its forensic investigation because Twitter users don't provide the same background information that Facebook users do,\" Schiff said. \"At the same time I don't think we've more than scratched the surface in terms of our understanding how the Russians may have used that platform.\"\n\nUnlike Facebook, which has said phoney accounts on its platform attempted to stir up divisiveness in the election, Twitter has remained mostly silent. Twitter allows users to register anonymously and has more public accounts than Facebook. Many lawmakers have expressed concerns about the proliferation of the anonymous \"bots.\"\n\nLawmakers have been interested in Twitter's potential vulnerabilities in terms of tracing potential foreign intrusions. There have been concerns that the company doesn't move quickly enough to remove posts and isn't able to track the original postings that were spread and retweeted.\n\nTwitter, Facebook and Google haven't yet said whether they will accept the invitations to testify publicly before both intelligence panels. The House committee is planning a hearing in October and the Senate committee has invited witnesses to appear on Nov. 1.\n\nFacebook acknowledged in earlier briefings with the intelligence panels that the hundreds of phoney Facebook accounts, likely run from Russia, spent about $100,000 on ads aimed at stirring up divisive issues such as gun control and race relations during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the company will provide congressional investigators with the contents of the 3,000 ads bought by a Russian agency, and he pledged to make political advertising on its platform more transparent.", "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter said on Thursday it had suspended hundreds of Russian-linked accounts and would ramp up enforcement of its spam rules as it probes online campaigns to influence the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nAlthough the company's disclosures in briefings to U.S. congressional staff and a public blog post were its most detailed to date on the issue, Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the company's statements \"deeply disappointing.\"\n\nWarner, whose panel is investigating alleged Russian interference in the election, said Twitter officials had not answered many questions about the Russian use of the platform and that it was still subject to foreign manipulation.\n\nTwitter has been criticized as being too lax in policing fake or abusive accounts.\n\nColin Crowell, Twitter's vice president of public policy, was among company representatives who met behind closed doors with Senate Intelligence Committee aides on Thursday.\n\nThe company was also expected to brief the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Thursday, according to committee sources.\n\nThe intelligence committees on Wednesday asked executives from technology companies including Twitter, Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google to testify at a public hearing on Nov. 1 about alleged Russian interference.\n\nThe pressure on the companies reflects growing concern among lawmakers in both parties that social networks may have played a key role in Moscow's attempts to spread disinformation and propaganda to sow political discord in the United States and help elect President Donald Trump. Moscow denies any such activity and Trump has denied any talk of collusion.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company said Russian media outlet RT, which is close to the Kremlin, had spent US$274,100 on Twitter advertisements and promoted 1,823 tweets potentially aimed at the U.S. market.\n\nThose ad buys alone topped the US$100,000 that Facebook this month linked to a Russian propaganda operation during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads.\n\n'LOW-QUALITY TWEETS'\n\nTwitter said it would toughen restrictions on suspect spammers, for example by reducing the time that suspicious accounts stay visible during company investigations.\n\nTwitter allows fictitious names and some automation by accounts, making it harder to distinguish improper activity.\n\nFigures in the company's blog showed the scale of the issue. In battling the automated promotion of trending topics, which get displayed to many users, the company said it counteracted 130,000 accounts daily.\n\nTo thwart abuse via applications interacting with Twitter, the company said it had suspended 117,000 apps since June that had been responsible for 1.5 billion \"low-quality\" tweets this year.\n\nTwitter said it wanted to work more closely with election and other officials and wanted to strengthen disclosures on optical advertising, as Facebook has just done.\n\nWarner is leading efforts to introduce legislation requiring internet platforms to reveal who is purchasing online political ads, which would bring them in line with rules governing ads on radio or television.\n\nHe told reporters on Thursday he did not have a Republican co-sponsor for a draft measure he was circulating, but said he was confident there would be bipartisan interest.\n\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz and Joseph Menn; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball; Editing by Peter Cooneyand Peter Cooney)", "Social-media companies are facing growing outrage over their inability to prevent foreign tampering in the U.S. democratic process. Investigators from the U.S. House and Senate intelligence panels are focusing on the role of Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet Inc.'s Google in Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential elections. Executives from those companies were asked to appear at a public hearing before the Senate committee Nov. 1, while the House panel requested them next month, according to aides from both committees.", "SAN FRANCISCO - Twitter said Thursday it had shut down 201 accounts that were tied to the same Russian operatives who posted thousands of political ads on Facebook, but the effort frustrated lawmakers who said the problem is far broader than the company appeared to know.\n\nThe company said it also found three accounts from the news site RT - which Twitter linked to the Kremlin - that spent $274,100 in ads on its platform in 2016.\n\nDespite the disclosures, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., questioned whether the company is doing enough to stop Russian operatives from using its platform to spread disinformation and division in U.S. society.\n\nWarner said Twitter's presentation to a closed-door meeting of Senate Intelligence Committee staffers Thursday morning was \"deeply disappointing\" and \"inadequate on almost every level.\" Twitter also made a presentation to House Intelligence Committee staffers in the afternoon.\n\nThe company \"showed an enormous lack of understanding . . . about how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions,\" said a visibly frustrated Warner.\n\nThe meetings between the company and congressional investigators were part of a widening government probe into how Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter, Google and other technology platforms to widen fissures in the United States and spread disinformation during the 2016 campaign. Those companies have come under increasing pressure from Capitol Hill to investigate Russian meddling and are facing the possibility of new regulations that could impact their massive advertising businesses.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that some of the 3,000 Facebook ads bought by Russian operatives promoted African American rights groups, including Black Lives Matter. Those ads were targeted at users in specific locations such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, two cities that have faced violent protests over police shootings of black men. Ads aimed at voters in other regions, meanwhile, suggested that the same groups posed a rising political threat.\n\nOther ads featured Muslims supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton for president and were targeted at Facebook users who might fear Muslims.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter are being summoned to a public hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Twitter accounts, which were taken down over the past month, were associated with 470 accounts and pages that Facebook this month said came from the Internet Research Agency, a Russia-connect troll farm. Twitter said the groups on Facebook had 22 corresponding Twitter accounts. Twitter then found an additional 179 accounts linked to those 22.\n\nBut lawmakers and analysts criticized Twitter for appearing to have accepted and looked into only the data that it had received from Facebook, rather than conducting a broader internal investigation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Twitter needs to launch \"a far more robust investigation\" into how Russian actors are using its site, adding that \"there are serious questions about whether Twitter has the capability to do the forensics necessary to determine how much the Russians used their platform.\"\n\nIn a blog post, Twitter did not reveal who was targeted by the ads or how many times they were shared. It is also unclear whether Twitter did a broader search of its users for Russian interference.\n\nTwitter said it was cooperating with the congressional investigation. \"Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, which is a cornerstone for all democracies. We will continue to strengthen Twitter against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam, as well as other activities that violate our Terms of Service,\" its blog post said.\n\nAlexander Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, said there is plenty of evidence that Russian intelligence operatives have been on Twitter for years and have used the platform to amplify messages.\n\n\"We need to think very carefully about what role we want these companies to have in our debate - and since these platforms largely regulate themselves, what kind of accountability we want them to have,\" Howard said.\n\nSilicon Valley has long enjoyed a hands-off approach from regulators and has become a major lobbying force in Washington to keep things that way. But that attitude appears to be shifting quickly.\n\nLast week Warner and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., urged colleagues to support a bill that would create new transparency requirements for platforms that run political ads online, akin to those already in place for television stations, according to a letter obtained by The Post. Lawmakers from across the political spectrum - including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas - have called for more scrutiny into the market power of technology companies over the last few months.\n\nFacebook has faced the greatest scrutiny. The company has said it will provide the 3,000 political ads, in addition to payment information and data about who those ads targeted, to Congress in the coming days.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for saying it was \"pretty crazy\" that fake news could have influenced the U.S. election.\n\n\"Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it. This is too important an issue to be dismissive,\" he wrote. He then emphasized that the role Facebook played in spurring authentic debate and sustaining democratic ideals was much greater than any exploitation that took place.\n\n\"The data we have has always shown that our broader impact - from giving people a voice to enabling candidates to communicate directly to helping millions of people vote - played a far bigger role in this election,\" he said.\n\nGoogle, the largest online advertising company in the world, also has been asked to provide information to congressional investigators and to testify before Congress, but it has not said whether it will do so. The company has said that it will cooperate with any investigation and that it has \"seen no evidence\" of a Russian-promoted ad campaign. Google did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn many ways, Twitter has been the most vulnerable to exploitation among social-media companies. The company officially says that 5 percent of accounts on Twitter are automated bots, but outside researchers say the number could be much higher.\n\nIt is very easy to create fake accounts on Twitter, making it hard for the company to discern the extent of Russian meddling, analysts said.\n\n\"They have no idea who is on their platform. If it wasn't for Facebook's data, they would have no idea these were even Russian accounts,\" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \"Anyone can create an account anonymously on Twitter and hide its origin.\"", "In Google's latest transparency report, even more governments want to know what people are doing online.\n\nGovernments around the world are doing a record amount of searching on Google, but it's a different a different kind of searching.\n\nThe search engine giant released its biannual transparency report on Thursday, disclosing to the public how often it gets requests from the government for users' private information, along with how often Google hands it over. The first half of 2017 broke a record for most Google user data requests over a six-month period.\n\nBetween Jan. 1 and June 30, Google received 48,941 requests for data from 83,345 accounts from governments around the world. The company complied with 65 percent of them, meaning more than 54,000 accounts were affected by this.\n\nThat's 4,000 more requests than the same time period in 2016. The number of reported requests on Google have been steadily increasing since 2009, when the company's transparency reports began, except in 2014. The latest report sets an all-time high.\n\nMore and more governments are eyeing tech companies for information in their investigations and national security issues. The Department of Homeland Security has viewed social media as a tool to monitor immigrants, while police have seeked voice data from Amazon to help with a murder trial. Apple also reported an all-time high with its transparency report released on Thursday, showing that national security requests tripled since last year.\n\nTech companies like Google and Apple often release these transparency reports to let their users know how frequently government officials demand data from them. From these transparency reports, we can see that governments are interested in how people use their technology more than ever for Google.\n\nBecause of Google's massive ecosystem, these requests would mean handing over data on content like your Gmail messages, documents you've saved, videos watched on YouTube, or any web activity that falls under Google's umbrella.Google has argued against the US government for the right to disclose these requests, including a lawsuit in 2013 to fight gag orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nIn the first half of 2017, Google received up to 500 national security letters for up to 1,500 accounts. These are letters demanding information that don't need a judge's approval because they're signed by the FBI. Companies are only allowed to disclose how many of these letters they receive in intervals of 250, so there's no specific number for Google.\n\nGoogle is compelled to provide information to the US government under Section 702 of the FISA Amendment, legislation that is set to expire at the end of 2017. Google, along with Microsoft and Amazon, have called on politicians to change the internet surveillance bill.\n\n\"Government access laws are due for a fundamental realignment and update in light of the proliferation of technology, the very real security threats to people, and the expectations of privacy that Internet users have in their communications,\" Google said in a blog post alongside its transparency report.\n\nTags Security Privacy Google Government surveillance", "When Oracle meets for its annual shareholder meeting on November 17, the board of directors will vote to reject a shareholder proposal requesting that the company do a payroll audit to check for a gender pay gap.\n\nIn a filing with the Security and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the board -- made up of nine men and three women -- indicated that it would reject the proposal unanimously.\n\nGender wage gap audits have been increasingly common as tech companies feel pressure from both their employees and the US government to prove that their pay structures don't discriminate against women. Several studies have found that men in tech continue to make more money than women for doing the same work.\n\nOne of Oracle's largest competitors, Cisco, completed its own audit of US pay in August 2016. After looking for gaps along the lines of race and gender, the company ultimately made adjustments to 2% of its employees salaries, the total of which represented just 0.1% of the total US base payroll, the company said.\n\nSimilarly, Apple, Amazon, eBay, Intel, Expedia, Microsoft, and Adobe have all also released gender pay comparison metrics at the request of their shareholders.\n\nOracle's shareholder request was filed by shareholders Pax World Mutual Funds, which bills itself as a socially responsible mutual fund.\n\nThe proposal requests that Oracle perform an audit for a gender wage gap by April 2018, and present steps to resolve the gap should one be found. The proposal notes that women make up 29% of Oracle's employees, but only hold 23% of its leadership positions.\n\nHowever, in its statement rejecting the proposal, Oracle argued that it is already doing enough.\n\n\"Diversity and inclusion in our workforce starts at the top,\" Oracle wrote in its statement, citing one of its two CEOs, Safra Catz, as an example of strong female leadership at the company. It also highlights the board, which is 25% female, as an example of equality.\n\nIn case you were wondering, Katz and her male co-CEO Mark Hurd both earned the same base salary of $950,000 in Oracle's fiscal 2017. But Hurd's total compensation, including stock awards, of $40.8 million was $103,000 above Katz's total compensation.\n\nThe wage gap between two CEOs owes to costs and expenses for to Hurd's residential security.\n\n\"We make every effort to attract, invest in and develop the talents of employees who reflect the diversity of our customers and the communities in which we do business...We are also committed to pay equity for all of our employees and ensuring that we do not discriminate on the basis of gender or any protected category in the full range of our compensation decisions,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The board does not believe that this stockholder proposal would enhance Oracle's existing commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace,\" the statement says.\n\nWhile shareholder proposals are almost always voted down by companies, Oracle's rejection comes at a time when tech companies face increasing external pressure to prove that their companies are friendly to women.\n\nGoogle, for one, has been at the forefront of the conversation since the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit earlier this year demanding that the company turn over more information about how employees are compensated. Google claimed that its own internal audits showed no sign of a pay gap, and succeeded in convincing a judge that the Department of Labor was asking for too much internal data.", "WE might love technology - but it turns out Aussies don't exactly trust it enough to had over the car keys to a machine.\n\nA new report said 83 per cent of Australians would still prefer to drive a car manually from time to time - even if they owned a driverless car - while 72 per cent are concerned about the privacy of their data.\n\nA key concern for drivers is the safety and security of the cars themselves, according to the research prepared by IPA, Advisian and UNSW.\n\nFully automated vehicles aren't new, with cars from companies like Tesla and Google already equipped with fully automated capabilities.\n\nGoogle's self-driving car already has 2.4 million kilometres in travel.\n\nBut the research comes in the wake of issues with Jeep and Telsa automated cars, furthering drivers' concerns.\n\nIPA Chief Executive Brendan Lyon acknowledges the fear Australians feel is real - though able to be overcome.\n\n\"The research shows that while there's excitement about AVs, there's also question marks in the community's mind about data, privacy and safety and hesitation about giving up driving at all,\" he said.\n\nA \"middle ground\" approach is advocated by advisory firm Advisian, where regulation would be\"responsive but follows observed community choices\".\n\n\"That's why we suggest that Austroads and Infrastructure Australia both focus on engaging stakeholders on the laws and planning changes that may be needed, and good mechanisms to understand how the vehicle fleet changes over time,\" Zoltan Maklary, a principal of Advisian, said.\n\nAs an opportunity to prepare for the potential of the automated driving future, the joint IPA, Advisian and UNSW research team recommends a four step process:\n\n1. Engaging with transport industry partners and road users to benchmark community needs, hesitations and choices on AVs;\n\n2. Developing concurrent Federal and state legislation and regulations to allow AVs to enter Australian roads;\n\n3. Reporting on the number, type and de-identified location of AVs entering the vehicle fleet; and\n\n4.

But the social network has also produced unintended social consequences - and they're starting to catch up with it:\n\n- House and Senate panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections have invited Facebook - along with Google and Twitter - to testify this fall . Facebook just agreed to give congressional investigators 3,000 political ads purchased by Russian-backed entities, and announced new disclosure policies for political advertising\n\n- Facebook belatedly acknowledged its role purveying false news to its users during the 2016 campaign and announced new measures to curb it. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg even just apologized - more than 10 months after the fact - for calling the idea that Facebook might have influenced the election \"pretty crazy.\"\n\n- The company has taken flak for a live video feature that was quickly used to broadcast violent crime and suicides; for removing an iconic Vietnam War photo for \"child pornography\" and then backtracking; and for allegedly putting its thumb on a feature that ranked trending news stories .\n\nFacebook is behind the curve in understanding that \"what happens in their system has profound consequences in the real world,\" said Fordham University media-studies professor Paul Levinson. The company's knee-jerk response has often been \"none of your business\" when confronted about these consequences, he said.\n\nHANDS-OFF FACEBOOK\n\nWhen such issues arise, Facebook generally restricts itself to bland assertions that its policies prohibit misuse of its platform and that it's difficult to catch everyone who tries to abuse its platform. When pressed, it tends to acknowledge some problems, offer a few narrowly tailored fixes - and move on.\n\nBut there is a larger question the company hasn't addressed direction: Has Facebook has taken sufficient care to build policies and systems that are resistant to abuse?\n\nFacebook declined to address the subject on the record, although it pointed to earlier public statements in which Zuckerberg described how he wants Facebook to be a force for good in the world. The company also recently launched a blog called \"Hard Questions \" that attempts to address its governance issues in more depth.\n\nBut Sheryl Sandberg, the company's No. 2 executive, has suggested that Facebook has work to do on this front. In a recent apology , she wrote that Facebook \"never intended or anticipated\" that people could use its automated advertising to target ads at \"Jew haters\" - that is, users who expressed anti-Semitic views in the Facebook profiles.\n\nThat, she wrote, \"is on us. And we did not find it ourselves - and that is also on us.\"\n\nMOVING FAST, STILL BREAKING THINGS\n\nFacebook's often unresponsive response to crisis may not work much longer for a company that sometimes still seems to hew to its now-abandoned slogan - \"move fast and break things.\"\n\nFacebook has so far enjoyed seemingly unstoppable growth in users, revenue and its stock price. But along the way, it has also pushed new features on to users even when they protested, targeted ads at them based on a plethora of carefully collected personal details, and even engaged in behavioral experiments that seek to influence their mood .\n\nHow it got here has to do with its exceptionalist company culture, a hands-off approach that values free speech over monitoring what its users post, and the fact that no matter how many people it hires, it will always have what amounts to a skeleton crew to deal with its huge user base.\n\n\"There's a general arrogance - they know what's right, they know what's best, we know how to make better for you so just let us do it,\" said Notre Dame business professor Timothy Carone, who added that this is true of Silicon Valley giants in general. \"They need to take a step down and acknowledge that they really don't have all the answers.\"\n\nMARKET INCENTIVES AND SOLUTIONS\n\nFacebook depends on signing up as many users as possible - and pulling in as many advertising dollars as possible - to run its business. Its systems for signing up and for buying ads are both highly automated, a fact that makes the company both efficient and highly profitable.\n\nIn the first six months of 2017 , Facebook pulled in sales of more than $17 billion and reported a profit of almost $7 billion.\n\nIt also helps explain not only why Facebook can seem so disengaged from its controversies, but also why it's vulnerable in the first place, said David Gerzof Richard, a communications professor at Emerson College.\n\nRussia, for instance, was able to exploit \"the capitalist nature of what motivates Facebook,\" Gerzof Richard said. If the company was truly focused on the \"content, message and quality of ads,\" he said, \"there would be a very different platform for how you buy and place ads on Facebook.\"\n\nSOCIAL HACKING\n\nGerzof Richard thinks Facebook should view the \"social hacking\" of its platform - that is, the unintended uses that spring from human nature - much the way it has looks at technological challenges such as spam and data breaches.\n\nFacebook already gives out \"bug bounties\" - that is, prizes for people who find technical flaws in its platform. Why not do the same for oversights that allow social hacks of its ad system, user newsfeeds and the like?\n\n\"We as a species are very, very inventive,\" Gerzof Richard said. \"You give someone a power tool and they will figure out ways to use it that the maker has never intended.\"", "Social media outlets have begun the process of scouring their site accounts and purging the Russian bots.\n\nFacebook's efforts have been in the news for several weeks. Now it's Twitter's turn to clean out the egg people.\n\nOn Thursday, Twitter announced that it had found 201 accounts that were linked back to potential Russian interference in in the 2016 election.\n\nSpeaking of Facebook, 22 of those 201 Twitter accounts were connected to Facebook accounts that had been determined to be from Russian entities, inserting themselves into the election cycle.\n\nTwitter said that of the remaining 179 accounts, it \"took action on the ones we found in violation of our rules.\"\n\nNone of the 201 accounts were registered as advertisers on Twitter, according to the company.\n\nTwitter also shared that Russia Today, a Russian propaganda news outlet that distributes content in the U.S. and other countries, had used the platform to buy advertisements targeted to U.S. markets in 2016. Three RT accounts, @RT_com, @RT_America, and @ActualidadRT, purchased $274,100 ads on Twitter.\n\nThe money was distributed among 1,823 promoted tweets, targeting followers of mainstream media.\n\nTwitter officials met with both the Senate Intelligence Committee, as well as the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday to discuss what they'd found, in regards to foreign players attempting to infiltrate America's election proceedings.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate Intelligence Committee invited Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing over Russian interference on November 1 sources with knowledge of the matter told The Hill. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the social media giant was also invited.\n\nThe House is set to hold a similar hearing and wants all three companies to testify there as well, according to a Congressional aide. Both committees say that they want the companies to share more details publicly on the extent of foreign election influence that may have occurred on their platforms.\n\nTwitter officials have vowed to continue the good fight against the egg people - automated accounts and spam.\n\nIn the meantime, if it comes at you with an egg profile image and a series of numbers after its name, posting in broken English, you know what you're dealing with - and it's probably not a real person, or at least, it's not a person from the United States.", "But critics say the proposal still favors the deep-pocketed tech giant, and Europe's top antitrust regulator is taking a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nGoogle said Thursday it will still present users with photos and prices when they search for products online and offer a link directly to where they can be purchased. It said in a blog post it will actively bid for those spots against other comparison shopping services and treat its Google Shopping unit as a separate company that needs to turn a profit.\n\nThe company is appealing a $2.9 billion fine imposed by European regulators for favoring shopping listings it gets paid for, but it had to provide a way to give equal treatment to competitors by Thursday or risk further fines.\n\nThe auction was up and running Thursday in European countries such as Britain, France and Germany, and competitors such as Kelkoo, Twenga and Shopzilla were participating in the new system, according to screenshots provided by Google.\n\nA spokesperson for European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told CNBC it was \"premature\" for the commission to take a definitive view of the proposed remedy and put the onus on Google to obey the equal-treatment mandate imposed in June.\n\nOpen Markets Institute, a non-profit monopoly watchdog based in Washington, said the proposal \"falls far short\" of what is necessary to address the company's abuse of its dominance in search.\n\n\"The auction model that Google now proposes would tilt the playing field to favor rich companies such as Google - which can simply pay more for search result slots - over less well-capitalized companies that may offer the public better services and more relevant results,\" it said.", "Peter Schwarz Correspondent\n\n\"How could it come to this?\" Many people are asking themselves this question following the far right Alternative for Germany's (AfD) electoral success in the federal elections held on Sunday.\n\nWith the AfD, more than 90 deputies -- open Nazis, racists and xenophobes -- are entering parliament 72 years after the downfall of Hitler's Third Reich.\n\nAlexander Gauland, the 76-year-old lead candidate, made this abundantly clear, calling for Germans to be proud of the achievements of German soldiers in two world wars -- that is, to take pride in a criminal war of aggression, complicity in the Holocaust and the cold-blooded murder of millions of civilians, partisans and prisoners of war.\n\nWhile many workers and young people are deeply appalled by the rise of the AfD, the outrage of the media and established parties is worse than hypocritical. They have paved the way ideologically and politically for this party and are now exploiting its electoral success to justify a further lurch to the right. Without understanding this context, it is impossible to understand the rise of the AfD and how to fight it.\n\nThere is not a single statement from Gauland and other AfD politicians that has not been uttered in a similar form by politicians from the \"respectable\" parties or journalists of the establishment media. This began seven years ago with the racist tract \"Germany abolishes itself\" by Social Democrat (SPD) politician Thilo Sarrazin.\n\nBefore the book had been printed, Sarrazin appeared on one talk show after another. The media-manufactured hype around the book boosted its sales. Ever since, the most despicable racist prejudices have once again become acceptable forms of public discourse.\n\nThen, in early 2014, a systematic revision of history was initiated. While leading government representatives proclaimed the end of military restraint, Der Spiegel published the article \"The transformation of the past.\"\n\nIt appealed for a re-evaluation of German guilt in the World War I and World War II. It was based on the views of two historians from Berlin's Humboldt University, Herfried M\u00fcnkler and J\u00f6rg Baberowski. M\u00fcnkler described as \"absurd\" the charge that Germany bore chief responsibility for the First World War.\n\nEarlier, he explained the reason for this revision of history, stating, \"It is hardly possible to carry out a responsible policy in Europe if one takes the view that we were to blame for everything. With regard to 1914, this is a myth.\"\n\nBaberowski downplayed the Nazis' crimes during the Second World War. He defended Ernst Nolte, the most well-known Nazi apologist among post-war German historians, and claimed that Hitler was \"not vicious,\" because he \"didn't want people to talk about the extermination of the Jews at his table.\"\n\nNot one journalist, academic or politician took issue with this extraordinary apologia for Hitler. Only the sozialistische Gleichheitspartei (Socialist Equality Party, SGP) and its youth organisation, the IYSSE, protested these statements and referred to other historical falsifications in Baberowski's writings, including the assertion that Stalin \"imposed\" the war of annihilation waged in the east by the Wehrmacht.\n\nA storm of slander was subsequently unleashed. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Cicero, Die Zeit and a number of other newspapers and publications denounced the IYSSE and accused it of bullying a renowned professor.\n\nThis did not change in 2015, when Baberowski made use of all available channels to agitate against Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy, for which he was applauded by neo-Nazi publications in Germany and the United States.\n\nEven after a Cologne court found that he could be described as a right-wing extremist, Sabine Kunst, the SPD president of Humboldt University, authored a resolution that declared criticism of Baberowski to be \"unacceptable\" and threatened students critical of him with consequences.\n\nThere is hardly a single statement by the AfD leader Gauland that has not already been heard from Baberowski. The Baberowski case shows that such political views enjoy broad support among the academic and political elite. Along with the SPD, the Left Party also backed Baberowski.\n\nEvrim Sommer, who is now a Left Party parliamentary deputy, invited him to a party event and threw everyone out who criticised him. Then earlier this year, Ben Gomes, who is responsible for Google's search engine, met with leading German politicians. Shortly afterwards, Google censored the World Socialist Web Site and other progressive sites. WSWS articles about Baberowski largely disappeared from search results.\n\nThe months-long campaign surrounding the events in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015-16 served as an advertising campaign for the AfD. A few incidents of jostling and assaults, which often occur at events where large amounts of alcohol are consumed, were grossly exaggerated by the media in order to foment an anti-refugee campaign.\n\nThis campaign was directed at reversing the broad wave of sympathy for refugees and spreading fear and panic. Feminist and pseudo-left organisations led the way in supporting this filthy campaign on the pretext that the issue at stake was defending women from mass rape.\n\nFinally, the clashes on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Hamburg -- provoked by the police -- served to legitimise a campaign against \"left-wing extremism,\" i.e. any left-wing criticism of capitalism. Justice Minister Heiko Maas even demanded a \"rock against the left\" concert.\n\nBy contrast, the terrorism by right-wing extremists was largely ignored or downplayed, even though, according to figures from the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, 179 people in Germany have died as a result of right-wing extremist violence since 1990. The same attitude has characterised the established parties' response to the AfD's electoral success. The ruling elite is concerned above all by potential resistance from the left.\n\nThis is the reason the SPD decided to go into opposition. The SPD intends to block the development of a genuine left-wing opposition to the rightward shift of official politics. All of the parties are seizing on the AfD as a pretext to carry out a further shift to the right.\n\nThey claim that the right-wing extremist party gained support because their own policies were not right-wing enough. In reality, exactly the opposite is true. Their right-wing policies are chiefly to blame for the AfD's success. This applies particularly to the SPD, Left Party and Greens, which like to portray themselves as socialist, left-wing or progressive.\n\nDecades of social spending cuts and the redistribution of wealth to benefit the rich under their watch have made it possible for the AfD's right-wing demagogues to appeal to impoverished and angered sections of the population. This is particularly evident in the poor areas of eastern Germany, which in the past were strongholds of the Left Party and have now voted for the AfD.\n\nThis process is an international phenomenon. In the United States, the close ties of the Democrats to Wall Street and the military made it possible for the right-wing billionaire Trump to portray himself as a fighter against the establishment.\n\nIn France, decades of attacks on the working class by the Socialist Party led to the growth of the National Front. The AfD's electoral success provides a devastating indictment of what has been regarded as the \"left\" since the 1968 student movement.\n\nInfluenced by the theoretical conceptions of the Frankfurt School and postmodernism, they opposed an orientation to the working class and focused instead on questions of identity, the environment and lifestyle. The Greens, which emerged as the true embodiment of the 1968 protest movement, abandoned even its verbal commitment to socialism at its founding in 1980.\n\nWith its entry into an SPD-led government, the former pacifists were transformed in 1998 into advocates for war, and supported the social cutbacks within the framework of the Agenda 2010. They are now preparing to form a government with the conservative Christian Democratic Union and neoliberal Free Democratic Party.\n\nThe Left Party is following a similar path. Emerging out of the remnants of the former Stalinist ruling party (SED) in East Germany and a wing of the SPD and trade union bureaucracy in western Germany, the party saw its main initial task to be the suppression of opposition to the horrendous social consequences of capitalist restoration. The Left Party has since become firmly integrated into the state apparatus in eastern Germany and campaigns as an openly right-wing party of the bourgeois order.\n\nTo retain its left facade, the Left Party relies on pseudo-left groups like Marx21 and SAV, which falsely portray themselves as socialists while supporting the Left Party's right-wing policies and making successful careers in its ranks. They do not seek to win workers for socialism, but to subordinate the widespread anger toward the AfD to the Left Party, which bears chief responsibility for the AfD's rise.\n\nThese groups are neither left nor socialist, but speak for well-off sections of the middle class concerned with a \"more just\" distribution of wealth within the top 10 percent of society.\n\nThe Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei is the only party fighting for a programme connecting the struggle against social inequality, fascism and war with the fight for a socialist society. Together with its sister organisations internationally, the SGP is building a revolutionary socialist party to unite workers around the world. This is the only viable perspective to stop the rise of the AfD and other right-wing extremist tendencies.- wsws", "Marriott International - the hospitality industry's iconic leader in guest service - is expanding upon the heart of its hospitality, its hundreds of thousands of associates, by creating additional points of engagement for guests, powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nRecently, Aloft Hotels, the innovation incubator for savvy global travelers, launched the first ChatBotlr, a new chatbot available via text message that gives guests an additional way to make service requests. Driven by ahead-of-the-curve technology, Aloft's ChatBotlr empowers guests to request basic hotel services right from their own smartphones. Aloft introduced the first generation Botlr, a robotic butler, in 2014 as an inventive pilot program to allow front desk associates to respond more immediately to guest needs, one-on-one. This next evolution of Botlr, the ChatBotlr, is available to all our guests on their phones, anywhere and anytime they have a request. With ChatBotlr, guests may text to request services, information about the hotel, listen to the brand's #AloftLive playlist and connect with the front desk team during their stay, even when the guest is not on-property. By leveraging natural language understanding and machine learning, ChatBotlr gets smarter the more it interacts with guests. Early findings show that 2 out of 3 Aloft guests are interacting or making requests with ChatBotlr and the service has a five-second response time.\n\n\"By embracing emerging messaging technologies, we can expand service to our guests on their terms and through communication channels they increasingly prefer and feel comfortable using,\" said Stephanie Linnartz, Global Chief Commercial Officer, Marriott International. \"The delivery of on demand service enables Marriott to simplify travel, remove friction and power up even better service for our guests at more moments throughout their travel journey.\"\n\nAloft's ChatBotlr joins Marriott's other newly implemented service innovations powered by technology. Marriott Rewards chatbots are available on Facebook Messenger, Slack and soon, We-Chat and Google Assistant, and serve loyalty members before, during and between stays. Marriott Rewards members on Facebook Messenger and Slack can research and book travel at more than 4,700 hotels, link their Marriott Rewards and SPG accounts, plan for their upcoming stay with articles from the digital magazine Marriott Traveler, and chat directly with Customer Engagement Center associates. Of Marriott Reward members using Marriott Rewards' Facebook Messenger this year, 44 percent received stay-related customer service such as changes to their reservation and 53 percent found assistance related to their Rewards account such as how to redeem points for stays. As technology becomes more integrated into our guests' daily lives, chatbots simplify the travel experience enabling guests to ask basic questions, make simple requests, and receive instant responses. They also free our Marriott associates on property from routine tasks, allowing them to deliver elevated, personalized hospitality to our guests.\n\nMessaging is growing in popularity with people in the U.S. spending an average of 200 minutes per day in messaging apps according to The Economist and recent reports show messaging apps as the number 1 most frequently used feature on mobile devices. Years ago, Marriott recognized the growing popularity of text messaging when it launched the Mobile Requests feature on the Marriott Mobile app in 2015 enabling guests to chat directly with hotel associates. Since then, 2.5 million requests have been received with more than half coming before guests checked in. Mobile Requests inspired Marriott to expand mobile communications options to guests using the device they always have at hand, their smartphone.\n\nMarriott's always-on approach to customer service enables the company to deliver the widest choice of engagement whether that is through messaging, call centers, or face-to-face on property with associates. Leveraging technology, we can deepen personalization, expand choice and connect our associates with our guests in a more meaningful way, as we lead the next generation of the guest experience.\n\nAbout Marriott International, Inc.\n\nMarriott International, Inc.

(PRWEB) September 28, 2017\n\nFor the past 10 years UserZoom has been helping the best brands in the world conduct usability testing and get to the end users insights they need to build better user experiences. In light of this achievement, we asked UserZoom's co-founder and CEO about his thoughts on this milestone for the company.\n\nAlfonso de la Nuez - Co-Founder and CEO\n\n\"It's been an amazing 10 year journey thus far. As you'd expect from any startup, there were challenging times at the beginning but we prevailed and matured as a company. Even with a decade of experience under our belts, we're still as passionate about creating the best UX research platform on the market as we were at the start, which is a great feeling to have.\n\nThe thing I value the most is the people that have really helped make things happen over the past 10 years. Also, the brands that have partnered with us since the start, such as Google, PayPal, Citi, and State Farm, among many others. I'm extremely grateful for our best assets by far - employees and customers.\"\n\nImprovements Over 2017\n\nOver the past year we've made great strides in simplifying the product experience. We've made studies easier to design and launch, improved our analytics capabilities, ramped up screening, and much more. But we're not stopping there. We're working hard on giving our customers access to even more capabilities in unmoderated and moderated testing, better analytics, and coming very soon, even faster, better, easier ways to source the right participants at the right time.\n\nWe know that finding the right participants matters, which is why our objective is to remove the complexity out of the very complex process of finding the right people. Our participant sourcing capabilities have always been advanced but they are now by far the most comprehensive in the marketplace by allowing you to leverage your own users for free or leveraging our intelligent sourcing engine, IntelliZoom, for access to over 120 million users worldwide. Over 28 million of which are accessible instantly with the click of a button.\n\nBetween that and the improved ability to screen for the right participants, we're making it easier than ever before for you to get the right users at the right time.\n\nXavier Mestres - Co-Founder and CTO\n\n\"During these last 10 years we have seen how UX has gone from being a nice-to-have to becoming a must-have, and how UX testing has become part of the culture at the most influential companies. This is why UserZoom is working extremely hard to continue being a valuable and strategic partner for all corporations that want to deliver great customer experiences in the digital world.\"\n\nBetter UX Events\n\nAnother core tenet of our philosophy is to actively participate and contribute to the ever growing UX community. Following the success of our UX events in London and Madrid, UserZoom hosted the first Better UX event in the US this month at their headquarters in San Jose, CA.\n\nThe theme of the event was Crafting Experiences in the Enterprise and we invited several UX experts from ADP, CoverMyMeds, and ServiceMaster, along with famed agile UX author and speaker Sean Van Tyne, to share their expertise in crafting enterprise-level experiences for their customers as well as offer tips and insights from their journeys.\n\nIt was an excellent day of speakers and of insight sharing amongst peers and networking, peppered with live flamenco music and scrumptious tapas style plates.

The shares rocketed almost 68 percent Thursday, closing the day at their peak of $23.50.\n\nThat places it among the biggest gainers for newly listed technology and communications stocks.\n\nRoku is the 22nd technology IPO of the year, according to Bloomberg.

We cannot accept a digital Wild West, and we must act,\" said EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova.\n\nThe companies have recently stepped up efforts to tackle the problem, agreeing to an EU code of conduct to remove hate speech within 24 hours and forming a global working group to combine their efforts in removing illegal content from their platforms.\n\nBut the Commission said the companies were still too slow.\n\n\"The situation is not sustainable: in more than 28 percent of cases, it takes more than one week for online platforms to take down illegal content,\" said Mariya Gabriel, EU digital commissioner.\n\nThe guidelines call on the companies to appoint points of contact so they can be rapidly alerted about illegal content and work with trusted flaggers - experts in identifying such content.\n\nExisting EU legislation says internet platforms should not be liable for the content that is posted on their websites by users, limiting how far policymakers can force companies, who are not required to actively monitor what goes online, to act.\n\nIllegal content should be removed as quickly as possible and can be subject to specific time frames, the Commission said, and automatic tools should be used to prevent previously removed content from being uploaded again.\n\nThe Commission said it would monitor companies' progress and could come forward with legislation by next Spring if it is not satisfied.\n\nThe Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which represents companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook, welcomed the Commission's guidelines.\n\n\"CCIA has advocated for a long time for the introduction of well-thought-out notice and action guidelines, and this ... is a welcome initiative for a more aligned approach on the removal of infringing content across the European Union,\" it said in a statement.\n\nHowever some politicians criticised the Commission's call for more automatic detection technologies, saying it would restrict the flow of information online.\n\nSky welcomed the guidelines saying they made clear that online platforms needed to provide greater protection against illegal content.\n\n\"The responsibility is now on the platforms to ensure that the online world becomes a safe environment for everyone - and they will need to do this ahead of the Commission's Spring 2018 deadline.\"", "An artistic rendering shows the new Google campus in Mountain View's North Bayshore area. City of Mountain View\n\nGoogle seems to be as much a real-estate developer as a search engine these days.\n\nThe tech giant wants to build a sprawling new campus in the North Bayshore area of Mountain View, a city in Silicon Valley that already hosts a majority of the company's properties.\n\nBut there's been a hiccup in Google's play for the development, which could include nearly 10,000 homes, 3.6 million square feet of office space, and a public park.\n\nThe Mercury News reports that Google is threatening to block the construction of 9,850 homes in North Bayshore -- which the company said it still supports -- unless city officials give it permission to build another 800,000 square feet of office space beyond its original proposal.\n\nThe Mountain View City Council found itself in a standoff with the company on Tuesday night.

As seen in the above photo, Trump and Melania spoke to the press on September 14, the day they returned from Florida to inspect the relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Melania was still wearing the green shirt upon her return to the White House and President Trump is still wearing his $40 USA hat, as reported by the Inquisitr, which can be seen in the viral video below.\n\nAs reported by Google Trends, the search term \"Trump forgets Melania is standing next to him\" is experiencing a breakout number of queries. Variations of the same search terms being reported by Google include \"Donald Trump forgets Melania\" and \"Trump forgets Melania is there,\" along with \"Trump forgets about Melania.\" So why are so many people searching for news about Trump forgetting about Melania? It all depends on how the following video is interpreted to the listener and spun by the writer.\n\nAs viewed in the video titled \"Did Trump Forget Melania Is Standing Next To Him?\" Trump began thanking the first responders and Vice President Mike Pence. When Trump rattled on that \"Melania really wanted to be with us...it touched her heart,\" at first blush it appears that Trump may have forgotten Melania was standing next to him. But Trump's words speaking on behalf of Pence - who was also right next to Trump - and then speaking on behalf of Melania, don't necessarily mean Trump forgot Melania was standing right next to him, no more than Trump forgot Pence was standing next to him.\n\nIf Trump would have said that Melania really wanted to be there but she couldn't make it - that would've proven that Trump forgot Melania was there. Instead, the rambling, odd and sometimes quirky way that Trump speaks seems lost in the interpretation of folks claiming that Trump forgot Melania was standing next to him. As such, funny videos like the one below, which repeat Trump's words and feature slow-motion loops have swelled to more than 11 million views, containing the words at the end, \"Melania...never forgotten.\"", "A pioneer in helping consumers cut the proverbial cord from traditional cable television, Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming content such as Netflix over TVs.\n\nNEW YORK: Shares of video streaming firm Roku Inc rose more than 67% in their market debut on Thursday, giving the US IPO market a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nRoku ended trading on the Nasdaq with a share price of US$23.50, giving it a market capitalization of about US$2.23 billion.\n\nThe IPO market is struggling to finish on a high note even though it has already notched more money so far this year than in 2016.\n\nA pioneer in helping consumers cut the proverbial cord from traditional cable television, Roku made one of the first devices to offer streaming content such as Netflix over TVs.\n\nBut the market has since become more competitive, with Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc and others offering their own devices.\n\nTo compete better, Roku has opened its platform to more TV apps than its peers, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google Play, allowing it to offer over 3,000 channels internationally.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company has also shifted its business model from sales of its Roku box. It licenses its software to companies such as Sharp and Hitachi and gets a cut of the advertising revenue from media companies and new signups for apps on its platform.\n\nRoku Chief Executive Anthony Wood said in an interview that the company will keep riding the wave of television content moving online and away from the cable bundle.\n\n\"When we sign up a customer to a subscription service or Hulu or Netflix, we get a revenue share as well,\" Wood said.\n\nIn six months ended June 30, Roku had around 15.1 million active accounts, with around 6.74 billion hours of content streamed, the company said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThose numbers, however, have not translated into profitability as the company pumps cash into marketing and R&D.\n\nIn the quarter ended June 30, the company posted a net loss of US$15.5 million, deeper than its US$14.1 million loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\n\"I don't like that they are losing cash, but if you wait for a cash flow positive tech company, you may have to wait for a full solar eclipse to come around again,\" said Brian Hamilton, founder of data firm Sageworks.\n\nRoku's shareholders include Menlo Ventures, Fidelity and Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.\n\nThe 15.67 million Class A share offering was priced at US$14 per share, the upper end of Roku's proposed US$12 to US$14 range, raising about US$219.35 million in proceeds.", "Amazon announced an ambitious slate of new Echo devices this week, ranging from a new \"Echo Plus\" to a $20 pack of buttons for playing Alexa-enabled games.\n\nIn fact, the company announced so many devices in one day that it basically doubled the products in the Echo line in one fell swoop.\n\nAll the new gadgets are hard to keep straight, so we give you the rundown in this episode of Geared Up.

But the social network has also produced unintended social consequences - and they're starting to catch up with it:\n\n- House and Senate panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections have invited Facebook - along with Google and Twitter - to testify this fall . Facebook just agreed to give congressional investigators 3,000 political ads purchased by Russian-backed entities, and announced new disclosure policies for political advertising\n\n- Facebook belatedly acknowledged its role purveying false news to its users during the 2016 campaign and announced new measures to curb it. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg even just apologized - more than 10 months after the fact - for calling the idea that Facebook might have influenced the election \"pretty crazy.\"\n\n- The company has taken flak for a live video feature that was quickly used to broadcast violent crime and suicides; for removing an iconic Vietnam War photo for \"child pornography\" and then backtracking; and for allegedly putting its thumb on a feature that ranked trending news stories .\n\nFacebook is behind the curve in understanding that \"what happens in their system has profound consequences in the real world,\" said Fordham University media-studies professor Paul Levinson. The company's knee-jerk response has often been \"none of your business\" when confronted about these consequences, he said.\n\nHANDS-OFF FACEBOOK\n\nWhen such issues arise, Facebook generally restricts itself to bland assertions that its policies prohibit misuse of its platform and that it's difficult to catch everyone who tries to abuse its platform. When pressed, it tends to acknowledge some problems, offer a few narrowly tailored fixes - and move on.\n\nBut there is a larger question the company hasn't addressed direction: Has Facebook has taken sufficient care to build policies and systems that are resistant to abuse?\n\nFacebook declined to address the subject on the record, although it pointed to earlier public statements in which Zuckerberg described how he wants Facebook to be a force for good in the world. The company also recently launched a blog called \"Hard Questions \" that attempts to address its governance issues in more depth.\n\nBut Sheryl Sandberg, the company's No. 2 executive, has suggested that Facebook has work to do on this front. In a recent apology , she wrote that Facebook \"never intended or anticipated\" that people could use its automated advertising to target ads at \"Jew haters\" - that is, users who expressed anti-Semitic views in the Facebook profiles.\n\nThat, she wrote, \"is on us. And we did not find it ourselves - and that is also on us.\"\n\nMOVING FAST, STILL BREAKING THINGS\n\nFacebook's often unresponsive response to crisis may not work much longer for a company that sometimes still seems to hew to its now-abandoned slogan - \"move fast and break things.\"\n\nFacebook has so far enjoyed seemingly unstoppable growth in users, revenue and its stock price. But along the way, it has also pushed new features on to users even when they protested, targeted ads at them based on a plethora of carefully collected personal details, and even engaged in behavioral experiments that seek to influence their mood .\n\nHow it got here has to do with its exceptionalist company culture, a hands-off approach that values free speech over monitoring what its users post, and the fact that no matter how many people it hires, it will always have what amounts to a skeleton crew to deal with its huge user base.\n\n\"There's a general arrogance - they know what's right, they know what's best, we know how to make better for you so just let us do it,\" said Notre Dame business professor Timothy Carone, who added that this is true of Silicon Valley giants in general. \"They need to take a step down and acknowledge that they really don't have all the answers.\"\n\nMARKET INCENTIVES AND SOLUTIONS\n\nFacebook depends on signing up as many users as possible - and pulling in as many advertising dollars as possible - to run its business. Its systems for signing up and for buying ads are both highly automated, a fact that makes the company both efficient and highly profitable.\n\nIn the first six months of 2017 , Facebook pulled in sales of more than $17 billion and reported a profit of almost $7 billion.\n\nIt also helps explain not only why Facebook can seem so disengaged from its controversies, but also why it's vulnerable in the first place, said David Gerzof Richard, a communications professor at Emerson College.\n\nRussia, for instance, was able to exploit \"the capitalist nature of what motivates Facebook,\" Gerzof Richard said. If the company was truly focused on the \"content, message and quality of ads,\" he said, \"there would be a very different platform for how you buy and place ads on Facebook.\"\n\nSOCIAL HACKING\n\nGerzof Richard thinks Facebook should view the \"social hacking\" of its platform - that is, the unintended uses that spring from human nature - much the way it has looks at technological challenges such as spam and data breaches.\n\nFacebook already gives out \"bug bounties\" - that is, prizes for people who find technical flaws in its platform. Why not do the same for oversights that allow social hacks of its ad system, user newsfeeds and the like?\n\n\"We as a species are very, very inventive,\" Gerzof Richard said. \"You give someone a power tool and they will figure out ways to use it that the maker has never intended.\"", "WASHINGTON -- Twitter's explanations of its actions against Russia-linked accounts are \"deeply disappointing,\" the Senate intelligence committee's top Democrat said Thursday after a closed-door session with company executives, and he suggested the social media giant doesn't understand the seriousness of Congress' investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia said that the information Twitter shared with the committee's staff \"was frankly inadequate on almost every level.\"\n\nAfter meeting with staff of both the House and Senate intelligence committees, Twitter said it had taken action to suspend about two dozen accounts that were linked to fake Russia-tied Facebook accounts that were pushing divisive social and political issues during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe company said in a blog post that it found 22 accounts corresponding to about 450 Facebook accounts. The company said it also found an additional 179 related or linked accounts and took action on some of them that it found in violation of its rules.\n\nWarner said that Twitter's findings were merely \"derivative\" of Facebook's work, and \"showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions.\"\n\nHe said the meeting underscored the need for the company to come forward in a public hearing. Both the House and Senate intelligence panels are inviting Twitter, Facebook and Google to testify this fall.\n\nThe committees have been investigating Russia's interference in the election and any possible coordination with associates of Republican Donald Trump. They have specifically been looking at Twitter and Facebook and their roles in the spread of misinformation and propaganda during the campaign.\n\nThursday's meetings lasted several hours. The company's executives included Colin Crowell, a vice president of public policy, government and corporate philanthropy; Carlos Monje, director of public policy and philanthropy; attorney Elizabeth Banker; and Emily Horne, global policy communications director.\n\nTwitter said it also provided congressional investigators with a \"roundup\" of ads from accounts used by Russia's state-sponsored news network, RT. The company said in its blog post that RT spent $274,100 on ads targeted to markets in the U.S. during 2016.\n\nThe top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, showed less frustration after his own panel's staff was briefed by Twitter, saying the meeting was \"good but preliminary.\"\n\n\"I think there are challenges to Twitter in its forensic investigation because Twitter users don't provide the same background information that Facebook users do,\" Schiff said. \"At the same time I don't think we've more than scratched the surface in terms of our understanding how the Russians may have used that platform.\"", "Let's say you wake up one morning and a muscle in your left thigh won't stop twitching, to the point of extreme annoyance.\n\nYou do what any one of us would do.

Twitter also found 201 accounts linked to the same Russian operatives who promoted politically motivated ads on Facebook, as reported by CNN a day before.\n\nThe real kick in the chin for democracy came from another Thursday revelation: An Oxford University study showed voters in 27 swing states saw a higher concentration of fake news on Twitter than any other states in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRelated: Why secret Russian ads on Facebook are a worry for America\n\nThose stories -- with possibly more to come -- come as executives from Twitter, Facebook and Google meet with lawmakers investigating how Russians used social media to sow divisions in the U.S. and potentially influence the presidential election.\n\nAmong the most vocal critics of Twitter's report was Sen.

John McCain, R-Arizona, and Hillary Clinton on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAnd yet another report from Politico told of Russian-bought ads creating divisions among political candidates, including Clinton, Jill Stein and the ultimate victor, Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook, and now Twitter, have said they've taken steps to clamp down on suspicious accounts and activity on their platforms. Facebook said that its newly rolled out measures helped prevent the spread of misinformation during the German elections last week.\n\nWhether Facebook and Twitter can ultimately stop Russians from weaponizing their platforms to influence Americans is beginning to worry people.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, described some of the Russian-bought Facebook ads as \"shocking.\" And Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, said Twitter and Facebook need to come clean.\n\nAnd it's not just senators expressing concern over social media's role in spreading political misinformation and its ultimate impact on democracy.

This ensures that massively profitable and unregulated U.S. platforms won't have to fork over additional funds to the Canadian treasury.\n\n\"Broadband coverage is uneven across the country,\" Joly noted, according to a transcript of her remarks. \"We pay some of the highest rates in the world. Our government won't increase the cost of these services to Canadians by imposing a new tax.\"\n\nThe announcement came as Canada, Mexico, and the United States are negotiating major changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nJoly also said that her government supports net neutrality. This prevents wireless companies from favouring their own content and jacking up the price for those streaming shows from Netflix or YouTube.\n\nAt the same time, the minister acknowledged that Netflix, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube (which is owned by Google) continue operating outside of Canada's broadcast-regulatory regime.\n\n\"If we're complacent, this new wave of information can drown out our own content -- our French-language TV and films, our Indigenous music, our multicultural programming,\" she said. \"This worries me. It worries our creators. And it worries Canadians.\"\n\nTo that end, she announced that Netflix has agreed to invest a minimum of $500 million in original productions in Canada over five years in both of the country's official languages.\n\n\"These partnerships will allow our creators and producers to make top-shelf, high-quality content that competes with the best in the world,\" Joly declared. \"This is what is possible, this is what we expect, and this is the type of commitment we will work to achieve with other platforms, as well.\"\n\nIn addition, Joly said the federal government will provide more financial support to the Canadian Media Fund.\n\n\"Writers, producers and directors have serious concerns about whether there will be a domestic market for their work, especially in the face of declining private-sector cable and satellite subscription revenues that contribute to the CMF,\" she stated. \"We are turning that around. Today, I'm announcing that, starting in 2018, the government will increase the federal contribution to maintain the level of funding in the Canada Media Fund to counter these declines.\"\n\nThe CMF supports programs like Kim's Convenience and Orphan Black.\n\nJoly added that the government will work with the CMF to \"explore what might be done to enhance early-stage development such as scriptwriting\".\n\n\"In music, we'll help artists and entrepreneurs develop the skills they need to promote their music at home and connect with fans in new markets,\" she added. \"Through the Canada Book Fund, we'll continue to support print and digital production and will experiment with innovative approaches to marketing and promoting Canadian books.\"\n\nIn her speech, Joly referred to $300 million in new funding this year to the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund. It supports a variety of locations to incubate startups, including the former Vancouver police station at 312 Main Street.\n\nJoly noted that there will soon be a parliamentary review of the Canadian Copyright Act.\n\n\"I will work hard to ensure that review is focused on creators,\" she emphasized. \"Similarly, we will reform the Copyright Board to ensure that we support cultural content, pay our artists faster, and reduce costs for all parties.\"", "Mixed reality (MR) is a new computing platform that's emerging from the current fields of augmented and virtual reality. MR blends the physical and the digital worlds into a single space, using a combination of cutting edge optical hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) software. Over the next 5 to 10 years, most industry analysts agree that the AR/VR market will be worth well north of $100 billion, with the vast majority coming from the AR side -- in the form of consumer innovations in retail, location, or AI services. In terms of the enterprise market, that pie will be smaller, but will lean even more heavily toward AR and MR.\n\nCurrently, at the forefront of the MR revolution is the Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft has uncharacteristically been early to market in this sector, with the HoloLens dominating almost all coverage of actual deployments of the technology. Although Microsoft enjoys an industry-leading position, it does face other threats from both new hardware entrants and established platform holders. Read on to see how the battle lines are being drawn -- and what potential outcomes could emerge over the medium term.\n\nHoloLens moves the game on from the previous-generation MR devices -- such as Google Glass -- which provided little more than the ability to bring up text or simple icons over the user's view. By contrast, the HoloLens is capable of both rendering full 3D objects and data as holograms, and of understanding the world around it in order to place those holograms in physical space. The self-contained nature of the HoloLens (it's a full Windows 10 computer that doesn't require wires or a network connection to function) makes it just as capable on a factory floor, or the middle of a construction site as it is in an office.\n\nThanks to the current generation's $3,000 price, it is more likely it'll be the next generation of MR devices that will revolutionize the consumer market. Meanwhile, industries as diverse as transportation, healthcare, industrial design and education are currently adopting MR via Microsoft's device to disrupt existing business processes.\n\nConsumer VR devices costing several hundred dollars from Oculus, HTC, and Sony run on powerful household desktop PCs that likely cost at least $1,000. They offer immersion in 3D worlds at what can be around $2,000 total, which could previously only be achieved with specialist installations costing $20,000 or more. Meanwhile, AR systems, such as Apple's recent ARKit, allow mobile users to view the world through a window, with digital objects superimposed. Both mediums are potentially disruptive: VR primarily in the consumer space; AR primarily in the enterprise space -- and have acted as gravity wells for venture funding over the 5 years, though both seem to remain perennially a few months from a great inflection point.\n\nIn new MR hardware, the two big players are Magic Leap, the $4 billion Florida-based behemoth; and Meta, the plucky Y-Combinator alumni with a comparatively teeny $73 million war chest. Despite their David-and-Goliath mismatch, Meta seem closer to actual product in the market, though neither have so far shipped devices to allow a true side-by-side comparison with Microsoft's technology. If Magic Leap ever does ship a product, expect an all-out turf war for the enterprise space, as all that venture money may well end up being deployed to compete with an even more capable Hololens 2 that may emerge any time from late 2018.\n\nThe more interesting angle of attack on Microsoft's current position may come from the very capable augmented reality support which both Apple and Google have added to their respective mobile platforms in 2017. The applications of ARKit and ARCore have mostly focused on the traditional 'hold your phone up and look through it' ergonomics, but many companies are looking past this by creating inexpensive head-mounted cradles which can transform a phone into a mixed reality device (think Google Cardboard for MR).\n\nDisney's recent collaboration with Lenovo to create a Star Wars head-mounted AR experience is based around this concept. If this approach proves popular with consumers, it could drastically narrow the considerable lead Microsoft has built up over its rivals Google and Apple, and bring MR to the consumer market -- many years earlier than most analysts have forecast.\n\nUptake of mixed reality has begun, but the sprint toward ubiquity has yet to start. Historically technologies take a while, then hit hard and transform fast. With so many major tech players investing in MR, that future seems assured -- but the likely big winners right now are less clear. Ultimately, as with any new medium, it'll be the players who find the most disruptive, high value use cases for the new capabilities MR enables. With its more consumer-focused siblings riding high in the headlines, challengers to the single dominant platform lining up and enterprise adoption accelerating. Mixed reality is lined up for an interesting next few years.", "The founder of Moosa-Duke solicitors has made a mark for herself as one of the city's leading lawyers\n\nOne of Leicester's most prominent lawyers has been crowned Business Woman of the Year.\n\nMehmooda Duke, founder and a senior partner of Moosa-Duke Solicitors, who specialises in medical clinical negligence won the accolade last night at the Leicester Mercury Women in Business Awards, held at Leicester Tigers in the city.\n\nThe headline sponsor of the event, now in its third year, was BHIB Insurance Brokers.\n\nMs Duke said her role at Moosa-Duke enables her to make a difference to people's lives.\n\nShe said: \"To me the law is all about looking after people.\n\n\"My USP is that I have worked for the NHS on other side and I pride myself on being genuine, straight-talking, being a Northern girl from Blackburn.\"\n\nMehmooda now heads a team of 15 people.

Just before the event started, Mr. Zuckerberg responded to a claim from President Trump that Facebook was \"anti-Trump.\" The event, which Facebook told reporters in late August would be on the record -- meaning discussions there could be reported on -- was made off the record last week, a few hours after Ms. Sandberg posted her response to the issue of racist ads.\n\nAs Facebook sought to polish its reputation, industry leaders were wrestling with the misuse of marketing tools that had been developed for their benefit. Facebook is seen as an unavoidable force, not only because it's the second-biggest seller of online advertising after Google, but also because it provides companies with unprecedented methods for targeting ads to people based on their tastes and habits.\n\n\"Sometimes our industry gets so enamored with new things that we lose sight of unintended consequences,\" said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \"Data and personalization is one of those things. It can be used for phenomenal targeting of potential consumers to buy cookies, toys and book hotel rooms, but it also can be used to target hate groups and inspire nefarious outcomes.\"\n\nShe added, \"Whether they like it or not, media companies have a tremendous responsibility to protect the public from itself.\"\n\nBut while the social concerns over such misuse are clear, brands are not responding by changing the way they spend their advertising budgets, as they did earlier this year when ads for brands like AT&T were discovered on YouTube videos promoting terrorism and hate speech.\n\n\"We haven't seen any clients question their investments in Facebook in response to the news, and I think the main reason for that is that no brands were directly or indirectly harmed by this activity,\" said Aaron Shapiro, chief executive of the digital ad agency Huge. \"It's definitely something the marketing community is monitoring very carefully, because certainly, if it becomes a big enough issue where public association with Facebook starts to become negative, that's a totally different story where advertisers would have to pay attention.\"\n\nRaja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer of Mastercard, said that although he was confident that digital platforms would do their best to fix their issues, their unparalleled size made the point essentially moot. \"I cannot block them off and say I don't want to deal with them anymore because they've got a huge reach and that reach matters to me and it is very economical reach, too,\" he said of Facebook.\n\nStill, it is likely that Facebook -- and Google -- will need to do more to show advertisers that they are policing abuse and that their ads actually deliver.\n\n\"The burden of proof that they are effective rises with every misstep on the social or political spectrum,\" said Rob Norman, the chief digital officer of GroupM, the media-buying arm of the ad giant WPP.\n\nGoogle and Facebook are often referred to as the \"duopoly\" within the ad industry; the research firm eMarketer projects that the two companies will collectively take in 63 percent of all digital ad investments in the United States this year.\n\nMr. Norman raised regulation as a possibility that could affect the dominance of the companies. He mused about the possibility of regulators saying \"that targeted advertising of cohorts of let's say, less than a million people, is now illegal.\" A regulator could potentially argue that \"the moment you can get it down to incredibly granular population groups, that's where the bad actions start to take place,\" he said.\n\nThere are also questions around how Facebook will handle disclosure of ads, for political and nonpolitical causes, going forward.\n\nWhile advertising has \"perennially been misused in political campaigns,\" the anonymity associated with the Russian ads on Facebook makes it newly dangerous, said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and partner of the agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.\n\n\"What would stop any of our clients from going out and doing this now?\" Mr. Goodby said. \"It's a possibility to just go out there and flood social media with things that are anonymous, seemingly innocent expressions of opinion, which is what we're addicted to. But it's interesting to think about what happens if we're being manipulated by that -- the very thing we're addicted to suddenly becomes like a heroin, it hurts us suddenly, people use it against us.\"", "When referring to \"fake news\", there is a strong argument for stopping using the label \"news\" at all given the implied endorsement the word gives the content. However, instead of closing ranks and distancing themselves from the phenomenon, traditional media could interrogate the content of common or garden \"fake news\" to find out why it so often appeals to readers.\n\n\"Fake news\", possibly the most ironic of all the oxymorons, has definitely achieved the status of a thing. It graduated into the Associated Press Stylebook in May 2017, and a Google search throws up almost 160-million results. And 26-million of these are news items: so fake news is now also real news.\n\nToday, the phrase is a put-down in an argument, a way to dismiss something you don't agree with, and, sometimes, almost indistinguishable from real, or true, news. And, so far, efforts to combat its spread have had, at best, limited success.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, and the research I am doing, let's set aside fake news that is obviously propaganda for the moment. The type of politically motivated stuff spread in the run up to the US elections last year, and, closer to home, paid Twitter and the hijacking of legitimate discussions for nefarious, divisive or unclear ends. Fake news is a spectrum, and for now, let's stay with what I am going to call \"common, garden variety fake news\". Articles such as \"South Africa To Introduce Hour Sex Breaks at Work\" or \"Funny man Kevin Hart robbed, beaten up in South Africa\" which appeared on \"fake news\" sites Mzansi LIVE and Live Monitor respectively.\n\nThe spread of this \"news\" is pretty counterintuitive, given we are being bombarded with more information than ever before. Facebook says that every day 800-million people like, and 175-million people love something on the site. And according to Internet Live Stats, every second, we send 7,765 tweets and 2.6-million emails, search 62,656 times on Google, and watch 70,877 YouTube videos. Anyone working in media or marketing knows what it feels like to try and cut through the clutter to have your message land with its intended audience. Yet, fake news seems to be thriving.\n\nSo what makes common, garden variety fake news stand out in this digital deluge?\n\nA point of departure for understanding the appeal of fake news a bit better could be through an examination of the similarities it shares with tabloids. Things like the language, concerns, categories and tropes fake news uses feel familiar. And studies into tabloids and their readers showed that in a newly democratic society, tabloids filled a vacuum created by the disappearance of the alternative media and mainstream media's focus on a middle-class readership. By contrast, tabloids focused on the poor and working class, speaking in their language and telling the stories of their communities.\n\nSo let's, for the moment, consider that there may be more to fake news than meets the eye and the reasons it resonates with its readers might tell us something useful about the \"traditional\" media.\n\nAn analysis of a narrative arc that appeared in one of South Africa's most popular fake news sites in March this year hints at some of the reasons for its appeal. Collectively, the stories that form this arc generated tens of thousands of Facebook shares, according to the counter on the site. And the site, Mzansi LIVE, has an Alexa ranking of 3,893 in South Africa, which places it on a par with, or even outperforming, some niche online media outlets.\n\nThe stories in the arc met few of the standards of traditional news reporting: no set style; no consistency and little accuracy in spelling and grammar; non sequiturs; no objectivity; and few direct quotes. Sources are simply fabricated or omitted, and articles rely heavily on phrases such as \"it is reported\" and \"it is understood\".\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is that, underneath the scandal and sensationalism of the stories, there are indications of anxiety about the world, including technology; sugar daddies/blessers; cities; the middle class; and young, sexually active women and girls. Compared to badly localised copies of international fake news that have been circulating for years, these stories appear to be original, inventive, and cleverly weave in the truth. They also work as a set, building a sense of drama and anticipation, for instance through the use of \"breaking\" in headlines.\n\nWhile additional research is needed, I would suggest that something else is going on here than the usual deliberate misinformation, entertainment, and scandal to drive clicks and shares. This goes beyond superficial \"click bait\" techniques, which the mainstream media has increasingly borrowed to attract attention online. Instead, successful fake news purveyors may have locked on to themes that resonate with its readers, and so cut through the digital clutter.\n\nAnd this can possibly teach us something. Perhaps the mainstream media's angst over fake news is analogous with the angst it experienced with the launch of tabloid media in South Africa in the early 2000s. Herman Wasserman writes in the book Tabloid Journalism in South Africa: \"Readers trust the tabloids to provide them with detailed news that keeps them informed, but also makes them feel connected to a larger society.\" Readers were getting something from tabloids that the mainstream media weren't providing them with. And this meaning-making was not contradicted by the expectation of only a certain level of truthfulness from tabloids. Hence, for tabloid readers, untrue news does not always imply meaningless news.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting that fake news sites should be brought into the fold in the same way tabloids were, when their editors were begrudgingly admitted to the South African National Editors' Forum (Sanef) in 2005. Indeed there is a strong argument for stopping using the label \"news\" at all, given the implied endorsement the word gives the content.\n\nBut I am suggesting that, when considering their ongoing role in society, traditional media interrogate the fake news content that is resonating with readers instead of closing ranks and distancing themselves from the phenomenon, which seems to the current response. One of the reasons this could be dangerous, is that it sets the tone for proposed remedies to fake news. The current obsession with media literacy and fact-checking as a silver bullet cure-all is the inevitable, ineffective outcome of this point of view.\n\nAs we ride out the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the media, like all industries and organisations around the world, are at a unique moment in time where they can reposition themselves for success and meaning in the digital age. And possibly fake news, with its ability to cut through digital clutter, has some lessons to share in terms of what really resonates with today's online audience.

And don't worry, your friends won't be stuck with blurry potatoes, those videos are later replaced with high-quality versions.\n\nUnless you've lived under a rock, you should be familiar with Google Photos, which is arguably one of the best products Google ever released. It allows you to easily upload and categorize all your photos and images, and it works incredibly. It can even identify the content of your photos, so when you search for something like \"Oregon waterfall\" or \"me with the cat\" it's able to grab the images that contain just those things.\n\nSharing all your amazing videos (like this) just got a bit faster\n\nThe new change might seem like a corner-case, but I've actually run into this issue a ton of times. I like to harass my friends with videos I record all the time, and it can take quite a while if you're on a low-bandwidth connection for them to upload.

Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told the New York Times that Russia was not involved in any way and that the Kremlin does not even know how to buy Facebook ads. \"We have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this,\" he said.\n\nIs the U.S. the only country that has had these issues with Facebook?\n\nDefinitely not. The company has been called on to police fake news content during elections in countries like the U.K., France and Germany. Earlier this month, Facebook said that it removed \"tens of thousands\" of fake accounts in Germany prior to its election.\n\nIs this why Russia is threatening to ban Facebook?\n\nNo. Russia is saying that the reason why Facebook could be banned in 2018 is because it is not complying with its local storage laws. Any company that collects any personal information about Russian citizens must store it on Russian soil. Facebook is not the first tech company to be threatened under this law. According to CNN, this is the reason why LinkedIn was banned in Russia last year.\n\nSo what's next?\n\nProbably a lot more hearings. The Senate, for one, did not seem happy with Twitter's answers on Thursday.\n\n\"I am more than a bit surprised in light of all the public interest in this subject over the last few weeks that anyone from the Twitter team would think that the presentation they made to the senate staff today even began to answer the kind of questions that we'd asked,\" said Mark Warner, a Democratic Senator from Virginia.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has invited executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) to appear at a public hearing on November 1, according to CNBC. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee also said it will be holding a hearing to \"better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.\"\n\nRelated What we pay for when we pay for a special investigation Bloomberg: Russian election interference is more widespread than thought Three things you need to know about the U.S.-Russia relationship", "The new service will be aimed at politicians, executives, and other vulnerable targets\n\nGoogle plans on upgrading its two-factor authentication tool with an improved, physical security measure aimed at protecting high-profile users from politically motivated cyberattacks, according to a report from Bloomberg.

The service would also restrict the types of third-party apps and services that could connect to a user's Google account.\n\nThe changes are not likely to affect standard Google account owners, as Bloomberg reports that Google \"plans to market the product to corporate executives, politicians and others with heightened security concerns.\" Following the 2016 hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account, which was the result of a phishing attack with links to the Russia government, Google began looking into measures that would improve security for users in possession of sensitive material and those in a position of political prominence.

Sprint is taking full advantage of the spotlight by offering a buy-one-get-one for the V30 Plus, with both phones costing just $38 per month combined. That works out to roughly $900 for two phones, which is a staggeringly good deal considering that other carriers, like T-Mobile, are offering a single V30 (non-Plus) for $30 per month, or about $800 total after a two-year contract.\n\nNot just that, Sprint is also offering a free Google Daydream View headset and a content starter pack along with purchase. The deal just gets better and better.\n\nGreat deal, confusing phone\n\nDigging into what makes the V30 Plus unique, it isn't a \"plus\" in the same sense as, say, the iPhone 8 Plus. It's actually no bigger than the standard LG V30, which also features a six-inch AMOLED display.\n\nWhat is different is the internal storage, which is doubled to 128GB, as well as the fact that LG is tossing in a set of its LG Quad Play wired headphones that are supposedly suited to take advantage of the Quad DAC built into the phone.\n\nAs the release of the LG V30 has crept closer with few details shared until recently, the announcement of an entirely separate model is somewhat confusing. This is compounded further by the fact that the Plus is not only the exact same size as the core V30, but also that the doubled storage doesn't carry much weight as a selling point since both versions have a microSD slot.\n\nI suppose the Plus-specific earbuds are a solid toss-in, assuming these are as good as the Bang & Olufsen earbuds that LG included with last year's LG V20. But what does this mean for what's inside of the standard V30's box? We haven't received a final unit yet, so we're unsure of what buyers are in for when they buy in.\n\nThe LG V30 Plus comes after Sprint nabbed exclusive rights to sell the Essential Phone in its stores. Given that Sprint is the underdog of US wireless carriers, it's definitely an impressive feat to nab not one, but two big hardware exclusives.\n\nVia Engadget", "SINGAPORE: During tough economic times, Victor Tay was often the voice of Singapore's businesses as the former Chief Operating Officer of the Singapore Business Federation, from 2010-2015. Today, Tay applies his business expertise to the social services sector. As President of the Association of Persons with Special Needs (APSN), he has spearheaded their social enterprise initiatives in order to bring in funds to finance the organisation's many needs.\n\nHe is also Chief Development Officer at the Nanyang Technological University, a job which he says has deepened his thoughts about how education can be shaped to boost not just business excellence, but societal mindsets about true inclusiveness.\n\nHe went \"On the Record\" with Bharati Jagdish about what it will take to transform Singapore into a more accepting society. They first talked about the current business climate, where despite many Government initiatives aimed at helping businesses over the last few years, he says there are still issues with foreign manpower and business grant policies.\n\nVictor Tay: This lies in the philosophy or the doctrine of what the Government tends to do. The foreign worker levies are actually re-channelled to their grants programmes for companies, but in terms of choosing or qualifying companies for these grants, because it involves taxpayers' money, the government puts in stringent guidelines.\n\nTypically, the companies the Government chooses for grants tend to be the stronger companies. These are companies that can actually project better returns or generate more employment. What about the weaker ones? Those who actually not able to do these things, meaning they are struggling, don't get the grants.\n\nThis is quite a paradigm shift from many other countries. I just hosted a Chinese delegation this morning from the Chinese Ministry of Finance and their thinking is that the grants are to help the weak and the vulnerable companies so that they survive and the general environment is good. In Singapore, we tend to pick winners. We forget that some businesses or even people who are not obvious winners might have strengths that could take us to even greater heights if we support them.\n\nBharati: Where do you stand on this issue?\n\nTay: I think we need to strike a balance. While we pick winners, there will be some companies that are currently vulnerable but could actually have great potential. I think they need great attention too.\n\nBharati: But like you said earlier, this is taxpayers' money and the Government has to be accountable, so wouldn't you say it's fair for them to pick those with the most potential?\n\nTay: I think with limited resources, it's inevitable and ingrained in the guidelines and criteria that they will try to choose the stronger ones. From the Government's point of view, yes, taxpayers' money is important. Businesses on the other hand, highlight that the vulnerable, and weak ones should be given attention. It's just like social needs. We look at vulnerable groups and give them assistance.\n\nBharati: But these are businesses. Should they expect charity?\n\nTay: Yes, I think that's valid. I think many businesses also highlight that Taiwan, America and various other places do not have many grants or assistance programmes for businesses. Companies are entrepreneurial. They can grow by themselves. I think our companies here do have backbones. But some of them raise the question of foreign worker levies.\n\nThey say as long as you don't pinch levies from me, I won't need to seek grants back from you. Allow me that cashflow and I will grow in an entrepreneurial way, just like in any other economy without a reliance on the government.\n\nIf the money can be re-channelled into entrepreneurial effort, businesses can look into internationalising themselves, doing other more fruitful things. That's food for thought for our policymakers.\n\nBharati: Do you, like these entrepreneurs you speak of, think that's a better way to go?\n\nTay: Yes. Our current way of taking levies from all types of companies, putting them in a central pool, then distributing them in the form of grants to the stronger ones is disadvantageous to many companies.\n\nBharati: If there are no levies though, won't the foreign worker numbers go out of hand again?\n\nTay: In manpower policy, there are two levers. One is the levies, the other is the quota. The quota can remain and will restrict the number of foreign workers coming in. I think many of the businesses find the quota will do. The levy is not necessary. But I suppose the government uses levies to shape behaviour. Channeling the money back to the programmes or grants and making businesses apply for them could compel businesses to evolve faster than if they were left to their own devices.\n\nBharati: You talked about striking a balance in the status quo - if the levies continue and grant schemes are offered, don't just pick winners when it comes to grant distribution. In that context, give me an idea of how you would like to see grants distributed. They surely can't be given to every weak company.\n\nTay: There's an issue with how to ensure an equitable distribution in the application process. It takes a lot of effort from the businesses and from the administrators. The current system requires enterprises to actually project forward, their projected returns in three to five years. That in itself could exclude a lot of companies with potential. For instance, a startup medical device or biomedical company whose trials could take many years, or maybe a social enterprise, may not give you that return so quickly. But they could give you those returns later.\n\nThey may be a niche company, one that's a differentiator. For instance, Airbnb or Uber. Five years ago, people might have looked at those business models and said they were not workable. Administrators might actually disqualify them if they had applied for grants.\n\nSo under the schemes which are sometimes too defined, new entrepreneurial, innovative companies might be negated. We probably have to develop a new paradigm to spot these types of companies, the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world before they become prevalent. We still operate on very traditional success indicators. We still largely go by the matrix methods used in schools - how many As you've scored, and in business, how much you can project in terms of returns. Sometimes you have to have faith and take a risk.\n\nBEYOND \"SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\"\n\nBharati: You talked about vulnerable companies that might have been overlooked under the current system and have had to close as a result. Some might say it's fair. It's about the survival of the fittest.\n\nTay: I have a theory about this. If we think of this in terms of humankind in all parts of the world, there are certain areas which are less conducive in terms of hygiene factors and therefore, they have a high infant mortality rate, or their average lifespan is only 50-plus or 40-plus. We could just say: okay, that's the survival of the fittest. But we could also think about it differently. There are developed economies where most people have long life expectancies because most hygiene factors are taken care of. Their young men and young women are able to live a more fruitful lifestyle because the conditions in those countries allow them to. I think for businesses, likewise, we have seen lower mortality rates in other countries too.\n\nWe must not think about it in terms of some companies thriving at the expense of others. Think about it terms of increasing the number of thriving companies.\n\nBharati: But there is also a sense though that many companies are not doing their part. They don't adapt fast enough or innovate fast enough. It's a mindset issue. What do you think?\n\nTay: I found among the businesses that died post-2010, many had long history. Some were family-run businesses. They had weathered many crises before that. There was the oil crisis in the 1980s, there was the SARS crisis and the Asian financial crisis. Many of these businesses survived through all that. The banks collapsed but they still survived. They highlighted that they actually were resilient. They highlighted to me that they were entrepreneurial, but they collapsed under the more stringent manpower restriction regime post-2010. I think this seemed to shed some light on the possibility that policy does have an effect actually. To look at entrepreneurs and say they are totally not changing their mindset, not being innovative - I think that's not necessarily fair to them. Business is about survival, business is about competitiveness, business is about how to differentiate themselves and this had always been in their minds, but the lack of resources did them in.\n\nBharati: But we must acknowledge that many businesses did survive even under the harsher conditions. So while these businesses that you speak of managed to survive previous crises, what did they lack relative to the businesses that managed to survive post-2010?\n\nTay: Of course, in every cohort there are some black sheep and those that do not quite do themselves justice, but I must say the doubling of company deaths, in many cases, was not because of a mindset issue. Just like when it comes to certain countries where young babies or young children have a high mortality rate, we might say some of them are not helping themselves, but there are general environmental issues as well.\n\nSingapore is likely the easiest place to start a business, but not necessarily the easiest place to maintain the business.\n\nIt's a very high-cost environment. Secondly, it is totally open to the entire world, so any American, European, Chinese company can come in and our SMEs will have to compete and have to be born global right from the beginning. So maybe look at some of the issues we discussed earlier. Think about levies, or the distribution of grants. Think about encouraging companies to then put their resources into internationalisation from the start.\n\nIn Singapore, because we have a small domestic market, everyone competes against each other. But they don't see that they gain leverage by synergising everyone's efforts. Two to three companies partnering each other can provide a more comprehensive spectrum of services. They can have better skills and mass to compete, hence when they go overseas, if they collaborate, they compete in an entire value chain. So for instance, a company that is in trucking can work with another doing warehousing and packing, etc. If they come together, they can expand their services. I think this is something that many Singapore companies are not doing well.\n\nSingapore companies do not collaborate well right from the beginning. They're suspicious and also count their pennies too early.\n\nSometimes you need to invest for the longer-term horizon and if you look at everything from a return on investment perspective within a three-year time frame, it makes many of these investments unattractive and unlikely. But we have seen enterprises in other countries investing for the long haul - five to 10 years and they make it back after. We need to be open to that.\n\nBharati: You talked about how the restrictions on foreign manpower have caused problems for businesses. The problems are related to, among many factors, Singaporeans' unwillingness to work in certain sectors. But also to the fact that foreign manpower had depressed wages in certain sectors before levies kicked in and of course the overall slowdown in population growth. Should companies be doing more to attract local manpower and to make sure they share productivity gains with their workers more equitably? It often seems as if they only care about their bottomlines and don't consider the importance of these other things, including the welfare of their workers.\n\nTay: I think that position has shifted. Today, businesspeople are becoming more enlightened. I think they realise to be sustainable, they have to actually share part of their profits with their workers. We hear about the multinationals, companies like Google, that give strong incentives. They give free meals. They have nice campuses. They try to incentivise individuals and therefore these people stay. But there are also businesses in tough times that are actually bleeding and hence they would treat their workers differently. They are not able to incentivise.\n\nThere is a perception that even when these businesspeople have profits, they will buy themselves another Mercedes rather than share profits with their employees. That can't happen anymore.\n\nManpower is thin. Therefore there is competition for manpower. Staff who are not well treated tend to leave. We have seen this in the last seven years. Many of them will job-hop. Businesses that are just hoarding profit or larger-than-life entrepreneurs who are self-centred are not able to retain talent and don't exist for long.\n\nBharati: Earlier, you talked about how Government support and entrepreneurial effort should be geared towards growing global brands. What other factors do you think are needed to help Singapore produce global companies like Alibaba or Facebook? Some of these global companies did this even without government assistance.\n\nTay: I think we have to change our culture, our definition of success. It's got to start from schools. Our paradigm is about picking winners. But our definition of winners is quite a traditional one. If we look at Bill Gates in his early years, he was hardly a success by our standards. When he was in a school, he was flirting around with different courses, he was studying design icons, he was trying to do animation. He didn't wear his shoes.\n\nIf Bill Gates had turned up at a Singaporean company looking for a job when he was younger, most of the employers would likely have said \"out you go\". If he had wanted to work in the civil service here, it would have been worse. He didn't even have straight As.\n\nSometimes our traditional way of measuring success does not qualify for what is the current or future business model of success. I think we must find new ways to define these successes and this goes back to our education system, be it primary school or secondary school to see how we can ingrain it in our students to see that it's no longer about scoring full marks or that distinction.\n\nInstead, it's about the breadth of thinking. It's about coming up with something new. It's about how you differentiate yourself. Unless we change, the whole society from employers, civil servants to hiring managers and entrepreneurs will use a very traditional yardstick and discount all the likes of Uber, Apple and even Bill Gates.\n\nAt the Nanyang Technological University, throughout the years, we have been rejuvenating our paradigm of training students. In the past, in classrooms, it used to be a unilateral way of teaching and learning. The lecturer would teach all the students. Now, we realise that's no longer efficient. We do the flipped classroom method of teaching and learning. The tables around the classroom have projector screens all throughout so students actually discuss, point at their screens and are therefore be able to cross-learn and cross-present to each other.\n\nThe Ministry of Education is also rethinking how we can do this earlier in education. Students nowadays are doing project modules so that they can actually research a particular topic and they also try to drill more breadth into it now. Students go for external camping and adventures so that they also train their leadership skills, etc.\n\nBharati: Ultimately though, many say the academic and standardised tests take centrestage when it comes to how success is measured.\n\nTay: Yes, and we tend to do very well at those. For example, the USA does not do as well as Singapore in terms of primary school Math and in Math and Science Olympiads. But they have more people like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates who dropped out of school and yet are able to come up with enterprises that are able to conquer the world. Our students somehow after graduating tend to choose investment banking, go into government, or be employed as professionals in multi-national corporations.\n\nSo I think even if the schools don't do it, we need to recognise diversified paths and routes of success at every turn. Don't discount people just because they didn't do well in school.\n\nBut schools also should change to keep up. I think we should now look at ingraining independent thinking and analytical skills in students. I've seen some cases of test papers where alternative answers were given to the model answer and they were marked wrong even though some of the alternative answers could have been correct. Perhaps we give bonus points to students who give a different answer instead of marking them wrong immediately.\n\nIn the global scene, to be able to compete, to differentiate yourself and to contribute to society - all these things are important. However, we seem to be generating stereotypical students who might be good in school but become under-appreciated when they go into the world.\n\nEducation should look at helping people draw out their individual talents. In the Western world, they put importance on individuality and they seem to have done it quite well.\n\nCOMPETING WITH HEARTWARE IN THE SOCIAL SERVICES SECTOR\n\nBharati: Recently, you crossed over to the social services sector. You are President of the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN). You've exercised your business acumen in this effort too through social enterprises that have been helping raise funds for the association and also providing employment for people with special needs. But I understand that getting professionals to enter the sector is still a challenge and you've been struggling with this for some time. Is your model of building social enterprises to finance your operations and paying people better for working in this sector actually working?\n\nTay: Yes, the Voluntary Welfare Organisation (VWO) sector is not one of those that is able to retain talent or even attract talent. We've done some branding efforts to get professionals to come in, but it's also about finances. Obviously, if VWOs do not get their act right, they will tend to be financially strapped, and if they are financially strapped, they can't pay well and they cannot attract talent nor retain talent.\n\nAt APSN we were, in the past, just looking to the students to pay us a fee, but it was not enough because in terms of our specialist needs, we had psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, job coaches and we needed a lot deeper skill sets than normal mainstream schools, and these efforts require funds to sustain.\n\nThere are Government grants for this, but we need to also do other things to add revenue and also increase our ability to demonstrate the skillsets of our students. So we set up the Mystical Cafe. In the last seven months, we've actually had quite a lot of patrons come by and it helps shift the paradigm when it comes to inclusiveness and also helps us fund our needs and provide gainful employment to people with special needs.\n\nBharati: You once said that it's very challenging to get teachers to work in special schools. Is that still a challenge?\n\nTay: Yes, and we still have problems competing for talent based on pay. So we try to compete with the heartware. We try to portray the VWO as one that really would have an immense societal impact. We have to draw them on compassionate grounds, show them how they can transform lives. It's no longer just about the pay, it's no longer about scaling the hierarchy, so they have a different sense of gratification.\n\nBharati: What do you think will help accelerate the impact of such efforts?\n\nTay: There needs to be a spirit of inclusiveness all round. Then we might have a better time attracting talent to this sector too. I think we are in the commencement stage. We are now slightly more aware because the Government is putting more of a focus on it, but I think we are still trying to manage the differences.\n\nTay: When I look at Europe, Japan or America, they have some successful models of inclusive education. From the start, children in kindergarten or their equivalent of primary one are exposed to diverse individuals with disabilities. In Singapore, we do this when it comes to race.\n\nIt's paramount for us to have multi-racial schools and classrooms. But in terms of people with special needs, we don't integrate them as much. We put them in different schools so many of us don't get exposed to them, and when we encounter them elsewhere, we don't know how to behave.\n\nWe need to have a different type of societal learning. I think if we integrated them from the time they are in school, we will do better, when it comes to working life. Employers in Singapore are cautious when it comes to hiring people with special needs. For example, when a special needs person gets excited, the employer associates it with violence. It's an awareness process.\n\nBharati: Recently a primary school here started integrating hearing impaired students into mainstream classrooms. How can successful integration happen considering that generally, there are concerns among parents and students? Some are concerned that the teaching and learning process might have to slow down, or that there might be more disruptions within the classroom if there were a number of special needs children.\n\nTay: Yeah, these are valid concerns. In the special needs sector we have a smaller teacher-student ratio, 1:5 or 1:8. The other issue is that a recent Lien Foundation survey asking parents if they are fine if their children get exposed to special needs children in a more inclusive society, they overwhelmingly said \"yes\", but when asked if they are fine with their children being placed in the same class as them or sitting next to a child with special needs, they said \"no\". I think that reflects the general sentiment. Many think that it's good but they fear that the presence of special needs kids will impact their own children's studies and progress.\n\nThat brings me back to what we talked about earlier. What are our success indicators? Success shouldn't be about the number of As you score.\n\nIf we measure a person's success based on their versatility, ability to communicate and interact with multiple personalities including special needs individuals, then parents will want their kids to be exposed and actually want their kids to sit next to a special needs child in class.\n\nIt goes back to our societal benchmark of success and how Singaporeans want to measure their child's successes.\n\nBharati: When it comes to the practical aspects though, for example, what you said about teacher-student ratios, ensuring that learning still occurs as smoothly as possible, what solutions can you suggest?\n\nTay: I'm quite heartened by another example that the United Nations has shared. They highlighted that in the past, there were two groups of people that that they were focusing on. One was the ageing population, especially those who do not get enough care from their children. The other segment was children - especially new-born babies - whose working parents do not look after them well enough. They experimented by putting these two groups together in a community and they found that it was actually beautiful. The older folks were looking after the babies and their lives were being enriched by it. The children's lives were enriched too as they were then learning from someone other than domestic helpers. The two groups complemented each other.\n\nIf we bring this back to the issue of special needs children and an inclusive society, I think just like in any other society, there will always be stronger, weaker or more vulnerable people. They can co-exist and most of them can actually learn from each other too. The stronger students need to learn how to help the weaker ones. The teachers don't have to be the only ones doing the work. People with special needs have gifts and talents too that can help the other normal kids.\n\nThis can be applied to those with severe disabilities as well. Some of them who are slightly more severely challenged than the rest have a talent somewhere. We just have to spot it and I think that lies in our education system to see how to support that strength in individuals and negate their weaknesses.\n\nPeople can cross-learn from each other, and therefore there is no absolute weaknesses or absolute strength. Teacher education here has to change.\n\nTeachers need to learn how to spot talent, help children develop their own ability to help others.\n\nWe are a rapidly ageing population and more and more children are reporting conditions like autism.\n\nThere is a need to grow the competence of the teaching workforce and the ability to support them. We see many sad cases where in the hawker centres, some impatient customers lash out at special needs individuals, not knowing that they have special needs. Society is made up of diverse individuals. Many of our students who work at fast-food restaurants have to deal with such things as well. Patrons are quite impatient. I think exposure has to increase, so that tolerance can grow and so that there can be acceptance. People generally have to slow down and understand that we are a diverse society and we need to have a paradigm and mindset shift in that direction.\n\nThere should be a greater emphasis on civic education early. When it comes to work, some countries give incentives to employers for hiring those with special needs and I believe we have such provisions too.\n\nBharati: But isn't it sad that companies need to be incentivised to be more compassionate?\n\nTay: Just enough so that they can make the workplace disabled-friendly. You need wheelchair-friendly spaces, ramps. These efforts should be encouraged and showcased a lot more. SG Enable celebrates superiors, managers who are compassionate and empathetic. Some actually even inspire the rest of their workforce so that they are able to triumph over their limitations. We should celebrate these things even more.\n\nWe need new societal learning. One of my friends once said that she was on the MRT one night. The carriage was otherwise empty. A teenage boy got on the train at the next station and came and sat right next to her even though there were so many empty seats all over the place.\n\nHe was a special needs individual and had a child's mind. His mentality was: there's someone there, let me say \"hi'. Some of these individuals have very pristine thoughts. They think like children. If I see you there sitting alone, I will go over and say \"hi\" and play with you.\n\nBut for the rest us, we may have had a different type of learning that has made us sceptical or cynical about human intentions. Perhaps some of us need to unlearn some of these instincts when dealing with people who have special needs because their intention is pure and pristine. They are quite innocent and they look at things from a very pure angle.\n\nI have anecdotes from employers who work with our students. For example, Uniqlo highlighted to us a special needs individual in their sales workforce. They said this special needs individual is one of the most jovial, most enlightened workers and even customers who come in feeling down are cheered up by this individual. So there is a strength there and the employer is capitalising on it. Why not leverage the strength rather than keep focusing on the inadequacies.", "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak penned an op-ed on Friday with a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, urging the current FCC to stop its proposed rollback of Obama-era net neutrality regulations.\n\nIn the op-ed published by USA Today, Wozniak and Michael Copps, who led the FCC from 2001 to 2011, argued the rollback will threaten freedom for internet users and may corrode democracy.\n\n\"The path forward is clear. The FCC must abandon its ill-conceived plan to end net neutrality,\" wrote Wozniak and Copps. \"Instead of creating fast lanes for the few, it should be moving all of us to the fast lane by encouraging competition in local broadband connectivity and pushing companies to deliver higher speeds at more affordable prices. It's the right thing for us as consumers and as citizens.\"\n\nNet neutrality is a longstanding digital principle that internet service providers should treat all web traffic equally and fairly. This means providers cannot prefer one website or service over the other by granting unequal loading speeds or by blocking or slowing content.\n\nIn 2015, the FCC passed a resolution to reclassify providers like public utilities and subjected them to tougher regulations. The now-Republican-led FCC wants to erase the reclassification with the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" proposal.\n\nThe proposal drew a record 22 million public comments and media attention over the past few months. In July, tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon spoke out against the proposal in a \"Day of Action\" protest. Internet providers AT&T and Comcast raised eyebrows when they declared support for net neutrality and the day of action, although the rollback of the rules would benefit them.\n\nWozniak and Copp urged FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to heed the public cries against the proposal.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a nugget of truth to the adage that Washington policymakers are disconnected from the people they purport to represent,\" they wrote. \"It is a stirring example of democracy in action. With the Internet's future as a platform for innovation and democratic discourse on the line, a coalition of grassroots and diverse groups joined with technology firms to insist that the FCC maintain its 2015 open internet (or 'net neutrality') rules.\"\n\nOpponents of net neutrality took a blow on Thursday, when the Senate voted 59-41 to advance Pai's re-nomination as FCC Chairman. Once the Senate votes again next week to confirm Pai's re-nomination, Pai will remain at his position for another five years.\n\nOne net neutrality advocacy group started a petition to urge the Senate to fire Pai. The group, Free Press, says it collected more than 10,000 votes in the first 24 hours.\n\n\"Since he joined the Commission, he's worked to undo policies designed to protect internet users, communities of color and poor people,\" reads the petition. \"He's failing at his job.\"", "The Nexus 6P is one of those phones that had high initial quality, but it hasn't withstood the test of time very well.

The studio's website reads, \"Because being politically correct is so ... boring.\"\n\nGamers play as a chef named Wong Fu in a run-down Chinese restaurant. In the process of serving customers and running the restaurant, players will have to chase cats and dogs with a cleaver, scavenge for ingredients and dodge immigration officials.\n\n\"The game maker titled their game Dirty Chinese Restaurant. Let's call it the way it is. The title of the game already is racist. It's stereotyping, and it's very prejudiced,\" Ontario member of the Provincial Parliament Soo Wong told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\nWong is the first female Chinese-Canadian to be elected to the Ontario Legislature. She represents the riding of Scarborough-Agincourt, close to Big-O-Tree's home of Markham.\n\n\"My big concern here is that this will further inflame the discussion about racism, prejudice against the Asian community,\" she said. \"We cannot allow this kind of so-called game to be seen as comedy or satire.

It's literally Chinese all over the world.\"", "Roisin Kiberd writes on the increasing role Ireland plays in the data centre sector.\n\nFor a small island, Ireland is home to some very big and powerful data centres. So big, in fact, and so powerful that 'large-scale' isn't really enough to describe them. These are the 'hyperscale' data centres of Ireland, and their number is ever increasing.\n\n\"We have a fantastic pedigree in hyperscale data centres,\" said Barry Rhodes, chief executive of INEX, Ireland's internet neutral exchange. \"The likes of Google and Amazon have set up here, initially with only one or two data centres, before expanding to multiple centres apiece. Now multinationals have up to ten centres operating in Ireland. Their experience here has been so good that they have continually expanded.\"\n\nIreland's proven track record as a location for hosting has served to attract further big names. Attracted by Ireland as a base for their European operations, multinationals view our country as a gateway to Europe, and where they go SMEs follow.\n\nThere's also our track record. \"There's a lot of ability here,\" said Rhodes. \"So many companies have been involved with our existing data centres, there's already a very good infrastructure for building data centres.\"\n\nBut one thing that's central to our appeal as a host country is hidden underground, buried below sea level. At present, transatlantic undersea cables deliver a direct line of connectivity between Dublin and America, with further cables reaching Cork and Belmullet, connecting with London, Frankfurt and New York. \"We have the sub-sea carriers, running through Ireland and on to Europe,\" Rhodes said.\n\n\"Most of the cables at the moment go from Dublin to somewhere in the UK, and then on to mainland Europe from there. Cork, too, is going to be extremely important. American internet traffic will be able to move via Cork, avoiding Dublin and London, and will be able to reach Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam, the other main centres.\"\n\nWith an excess of web traffic directed through London, multinationals are looking for alternatives. \"A large percentage of the data centres in London are in the Thames Valley near the Docklands, below sea level,\" Rhodes said. \"It's subject to flooding, and there's already so much there. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others want their traffic to follow a diverse route instead.\"\n\nRhodes predicts a boom in interest around Cork, especially due to the Tier 1 Express fibre cable added by Hibernia Networks, acquired by GT earlier this year for $590 million. Add to this a near-universal drive for data, and Irish data centres stand to thrive in years to come.\n\n\"Global data is expected to double every two years for the next decade,\" agreed Rhodes. \"There will be more and more requirement for cloud services, and cloud services need storage in data centres.\"\n\nThe future looks very bright, all GDPR-induced panic aside. Rhodes said: \"In the data centre industry, people talk a lot about 'FLAP cities', standing for Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris, the four main data centre cities in Europe. But now, not just in Ireland, but internationally, the acronym has become 'FLAPD', with a 'D' for Dublin.\"", "After condemning the tech giants for fuelling terror online, the Tories accepted \u00a332,500 from Google and \u00a336,000 from Microsoft for stands at their party conference, with a further \u00a33,500 paid by Amazon for an ad in the event's handbook\n\nGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nTheresa May has been branded a \"complete hypocrite\" for accepting \u00a372,000 from web giants after at\u00ad\u00adtack\u00ad\u00ading them for fuelling online terror .\n\nThe Daily Mirror has learned Google paid \u00a332,500 for a six metre-square stand at the Tory Conference which opens on Sunday in Manchester.\n\nSalman Abedi used videos from Google-owned YouTube to help to build the bomb that killed 22 in the same city.\n\nThe Tories also pocketed \u00a336,000 from Microsoft for a stand plus advertising, and \u00a33,500 from Amazon for a full-page ad in the conference handbook.\n\nEarlier this month Mrs May - who today visited British troops in Estonia - made a speech at the UN and vowed to fine firms like Microsoft and Google unless they removed terrorist material within two hours of it being posted.\n\nAnd her government has also begun talks with Amazon about selling items on its websites that could help jihadis.

As University of Pittsburgh Law Professor Dan Kovalik told Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear this week, the editorial gurus at the Washington Post don't even know what entity or entities exactly purchased the controversial ads. Instead, US media outlets are \"just presuming it was a Russian company of some sort,\" Kovalik said Tuesday.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Pablo Martinez MonsivaisWashington Post Fans Flames as New McCarthyism Engulfs Washington\n\nIn addition to vocally expressing her support for the first major female candidate, Sandberg met with Clinton \"on multiple occasions,\" the WikiLeaks publisher tweeted, with attachments of photos documenting that Sandberg offered to present Facebook's research \"on gender and leadership by women,\" according to one of the emails written by Clinton confidant Cheryl Mills.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg meanwhile sent emails to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta to the tune of \"I enjoyed spending time with you yesterday and our conversation gave me a lot to think about ... I hope it's okay if I reach out as my thinking develops to get your ideas and reactions. If there are any other folks you think I should talk to, please let me know. Thanks again.

To be fair, AWS is one of the most widely used server farms by the US government.\n\nIndeed, AWS is the link between Jeff Bezos and the CIA: arguably America's finest intelligence agency paid Bezos' company $600 million for a \"computing cloud developed by Amazon Web Services for the Central Intelligence Agency\" that \"will begin servicing all 17 agencies that make up the intelligence community,\" The Atlantic reported in July 2014.\n\nGive Schmidt credit for suggesting Clinton's campaign use a service good enough for the CIA -- perhaps better cyber defenses would have prevented the so-called DNC \"hack\" blamed, of course, on the Russians (and which several independent former intelligence officers have argued was a leak).\n\nPixabayAnti-Logic: FBI Blind to DNC Servers Before Accusing Russia of Cyberattack\n\nSchmidt outlined his ideas to include discussions on \"size, structure, and timing\" of the campaign, the location for the campaign's headquarters, six points on \"the pieces of the Campaign,\" - \"The Field,\" \"The Voter,\" \"Digital,\" \"Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling,\" \"Analytics and data science modeling, polling and resource optimization tools\" and \"Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online.\"\n\nSchmidt would ultimately settle for a role outside the formal campaign, though the position did not wind up as a small one. \"I met with Eric Schmidt tonight,\" Podesta wrote in an April 2014 email to another staffer. \"He's ready to fund, advise, recruit talent, etc. [He] clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn't seem like he wanted to push others out.\"\n\nSome US lawmakers are becoming frustrated at, apparently, Twitter and Facebook's inability to conjure up actual Russian wrongdoing on their platforms.

Only a small number of people had purchased these new iPhones because most have been waiting for the iPhone X. Many buyers took it to MacRumors forum, Reddit and Apple's support forum to complain about the iPhone 8 crackling sound issue.\n\niPhone 8 crackling sound is a software problem\n\nFortunately, Apple has promised to fix the issue via a software update. The tech giant is already working on a fix. \"Dozens\" of users complained that there was a crackling or \"static\" sound coming out of their brand new phone's earpiece. It was disrupting the audio during the phone calls. The issue was first reported by The Verge, one of whose editors experienced it first-hand. It sounds like \"sharp pops at the very edge of the earpiece,\" said The Verge.\n\nThe iPhone 8 crackling sound appears to be a software problem rather than a hardware one. It affects both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Users in different forums reported that it was happening across a variety of carriers in different parts of the world. It occurs during the phone and FaceTime calls, though it doesn't happen with every single call. The iPhone 8 crackling noise doesn't appear when using the earpiece as the loudspeaker. If it were related to hardware, there would be a consistency in the problem.\n\nApple says the issue affects only 'a small number' of users\n\nApple told The Verge it was aware of the issue that was affecting \"customers in a small number of cases.\" A fix will be included in an upcoming software update. However, the tech giant didn't mention when the fix will be rolled out to customers. It's well known that Apple issues multiple software updates in the weeks following the launch of its new phones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company released the iOS 11.0.1 update that brings performance improvements. The update also fixed bugs that affected the Exchange and Outlook.com account users when sending emails through the Mail app. Apple has also promised to push out a software update for the Apple Watch Series 3. A bug in the new Apple Watch causes it to connect to unauthenticated WiFi networks, which could lead to serious problems for users.\n\niPhone 8 Plus has the world's best smartphone camera\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are minor upgrades over last year's models. The new phones feature wireless charging and a faster A11 Bionic chip, though they retain the design of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Apple has also improved the new iPhones' camera. The iPhone 8 Plus has a 12MP wide-angle lens with an f/1.8 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with an f/2.8 aperture. The company has added Portrait Lighting to the iPhone 8 Plus camera.\n\nCamera testing firm DxOMark recently said that the iPhone 8 Plus had the best smartphone camera they had ever tested. The 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus scored 94 out of 100 points. It was closely followed by the iPhone 8 with 92 points. Google Pixel and HTC U11, both of which were at the top before the iPhone 8 debut, had scored 90 points each.\n\nSeparately, IHS Markit estimates that the bill of materials for the new iPhones is higher than their predecessors. According to the research firm, the regular iPhone 8's component cost is $247.51 for the 64GB storage model, up from $237.94 for the 32GB iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 sells for $699 compared to the iPhone 7's starting price of $649. Component costs for the larger iPhone 8 Plus are $288.08 for the 64GB version. It is higher than the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus's $270.88. The iPhone 8 Plus has a starting price of $799.\n\niPhone 8 sales not weak, says Ming-Chi Kuo\n\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus didn't see the same level of pre-orders, sales, and consumer enthusiasm as the flagship models released in previous years. Most potential buyers have decided to hold out for the iPhone X rather than buying iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. There were no long queues in front of Apple Stores during the opening weekend, neither were online pre-orders great.\n\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in his latest note to investors that the Wall Street and media went insane about the lower than expected iPhone 8 sales. Kuo said that based on Apple's iPhone 8 production and research data from Localytics, the market has been \"excessively negative\" on the iPhone 8. The analyst said the iPhone 8 sales were \"stable\" rather than weak.\n\nKuo said production for the 2017 models would be split 50:50 between the iPhone X and the iPhone 8/8 Plus. Apple had factored it into production plans. According to data from Localytics, the combined first-weekend adoption rate for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus appears about half of the iPhone 7/7 Plus and the iPhone 6S/6S Plus. It's because the iPhone X is not included, not because the iPhone 8 sales are weak.\n\nThe iPhone X is scheduled to hit the store shelves on November 3. However, it will be short supply through this year.\n\nTags: Apple iPhone 8", "The only US carrier to have the LG V30+ is putting out another BOGO deal for this very expensive phone.

Does it matter?\n\nIBM now employs 130,000 people in India - about a third of its total work force - and \"well under 100,000 people at its American offices,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAs recently as 2002, IBM only employed about 6,000 people in India, so it has been hiring roughly 8,000 a year. Also in 2002, IBM employed around 160,000 people in the USA. This had been reduced to 105,000 in 2009, when IBM stopped providing numbers. What it is today is anyone's guess. While there have been various lay-offs, IBM has also added staff by buying more than 150 companies.\n\nThe change to \"Indian Business Machines\" has hit the news because Times tech reporter Vindu Goel got an interview with Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the IBM's Indian operations, in Bangalore. However, the transition may have happened five years ago. In 2012, for example, Computerworld suggested that \"In a symbolic shift, IBM's India workforce likely exceeds U.S.\" This story was based on an internal document that IBM refused to confirm.\n\nEither way, the shift is not surprising, for three reasons. First, India produces a lot of English-speaking computer science graduates willing to work for much lower wages than American programmers. Second, the USA has been restricting immigration from India and other countries, so many have been working under temporary H-1B visas. Third, India is trying to build its own technology industry, under prime minister Narendra Modi's flagship Digital India project. This should encourage more of the country's best technologists to work in or return to India.\n\nIndia's technology industry boomed on outsourcing through companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro. More recently, it moved into web and then smartphone app development, which is one of the things it does for IBM.\n\nAs Goel reports: \"IBM even has a Bangalore 'garage' full of app designers who build corporate iPhone and iPad apps to simplify tasks like helping airline agents rebook passengers, bankers make loans and doctors update patient files.\"\n\nThe real question is whether it has done IBM any good.\n\nIBM has now suffered 21 quarters in a row of declining revenues, and its 2016 turnover of $79.92 billion is less than it was in 1998 ($81.67bn). This is a wretched performance in a market where companies like Apple, Google and Facebook have come from almost, or literally, nothing.\n\nIf you believe the message boards where former and some current IBM employees hang out, this is partly the result of replacing highly-skilled but highly-paid, experienced and productive senior employees with low-skilled, lower-paid and less productive junior employees, whether based in India or not.\n\nThat may well be true, but it's only one of many factors in IBM's long-term decline....", "With U.S. stocks hitting all-time highs this past week and the calendar just about to flip to October, think 30 years back with me to Friday, Oct. 16, 1987.\n\nThe stock market is up more than 30% for the year so far. But traders are jittery: Interest rates are rising, tax rates are in flux and the U.S. is bickering with international trade partners and skirmishing with Iran.\n\nJames O'Shaughnessy, a young investor in St. Paul, Minn., has made a \"five-figure\" bet on stock-index put options, a way of profiting from a sharp fall in price on a basket of big U.S. stocks. Plugging his phone into a modem that dials up a stock-quotation service, he grows more and more nervous as the day goes on and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls a record 108.35 points on unprecedented volume of nearly 339 million shares.\n\nThe selling is \"completely overdone,\" he thinks: Stocks are bound to bounce back big on Monday \"and then I'll get killed\" for hanging on to the bearish bet. \"A feeling of panic washed over my entire body,\" Mr. O'Shaughnessy says. \"I've just got to get out.\" He calls his broker a half-hour before the market closes and sells it all.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nThat weekend, Mr. O'Shaughnessy feels \"greatly relieved,\" as if \"I had just dodged being hit by a bullet.\" All the negative talk among investors has convinced him that stocks will have a \"relief rally\" on Monday; by selling his puts, he has surely averted a huge loss.\n\nThen comes Monday. In New York, the Dow drops 208 points in the first 90 minutes, triggering a wave of selling by institutional investors using a technique called portfolio insurance to minimize losses. Futures traders in Chicago, who would normally buy, step back, expecting a further fall.\n\nBy day's end, the Dow has fallen 22.6%, \"the worst day in Wall Street history,\" as journalist Diana Henriques calls Oct. 19, 1987, in her excellent new book, \"A First-Class Catastrophe.\" An equivalent drop in 2017 would hack more than 5,000 points off the Dow in a day.\n\nYou can't survive a market crash if you think it can't happen. And something like Oct. 19, 1987, will happen again. In fact, it already has: On May 6, 2010, many stocks dropped 60% or more in a flash, although they bounced right back. On Aug. 24, 2015, the Dow fell more than 1,000 points, or 7%, in six minutes, before closing down nearly 4% for the day. Between the market's peak in October 2007 and its bottom on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 fell 55.2%, even after counting reinvested dividends.\n\nMs. Henriques' book, and the story Mr. O'Shaughnessy told me, are a reminder that \"human nature can't be repealed,\" as she says. \"Historical amnesia leaves us doomed to repeat our past disasters, and the only antidote is to remember accurately what happened.\"\n\nTake it from Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who today manages nearly $6 billion at O'Shaughnessy Asset Management in Stamford, Conn. Even though he based it on factors he no longer believes in, his original analysis was absolutely right: The stock market was overvalued. Between September 1986 and the end of August 1987, stocks had gone from trading at 16 times earnings to a price/earnings ratio of 21.4, a 33% rise that put the market's P/E at its highest level since the end of 1961.\n\nHis emotional reaction, however, was dead wrong. Had Mr. O'Shaughnessy held his ground for one more day, he would have made roughly 10 times his money, he recalls.\n\nMs. Henriques attributes the crash of 1987 to ineffectual regulation and breakdowns in the complex mechanics of trading. But no one knows for sure what caused it, or the far more devastating crash of 1929 either, says financial historian and retired Goldman Sachs partner Barrie Wigmore.\n\nHistory does offer a few clear lessons.\n\nStocks have been overvalued, by long-term standards, for most of the past three decades. So, on average, you were more likely to have missed consistent gains than to have dodged a crash if you got out of the market entirely.\n\nInvestors today who hold large positions in the hottest stocks of the past few years -- the so-called FANGs, or Facebook , Amazon.com , Netflix and the parent company of Google -- should consider trimming their positions, however. In 1987, as in 1929, the stocks that had previously gone up the most tended to fall the farthest.\n\nAbove all, says Staley Cates, vice chairman of Southeastern Asset Management in Memphis, Tenn., \"don't be afraid to hold cash.\" On Oct. 19, 1987, he and his young colleagues clustered around a Quotron machine putting in buy orders as they watched the market crash, \"and the ultimate comfort we had that day was holding 25% to 30% of our portfolios in cash.\"\n\nWithout it, \"we couldn't have bought stocks,\" he says. Having the cash to buy when others are selling is the surest source of courage in a crash.", "I went to my first concert when I was 15, as a sophomore in high school. The band was Thirty Seconds to Mars, and I loved them. My best friend and I had seen, quite literally, every single live performance of the band there was to see on YouTube (a more manageable feat in 2010 than it is now). The venue was the gorgeously intimate House of Blues in San Diego, and the two of us wore homemade ribbon-and-key necklaces based on the band's \"Hurricane\" video.\n\nThat night I found, in the roiling, screaming mass of people packed inside the venue, the magic of rock concerts. Even as someone who hates crowds, feeling the energy of hundreds of people directed toward the same goal, the same idea, and allowing myself to let go and jump and mosh and scream my heart out to the lyrics was a cathartic experience I've been chasing ever since.\n\nNothing can quite beat being on the barrier -- in the pit -- of a band you love. I've probably been to a hundred concerts since that first show, and each has been unique: I've known the band more, or less; I've been closer or farther; it's been a tiny indoor venue or a massive festival lawn. I've seen Malian desert punk bands, emo pop rock bands, jazz bands, classical musicians and Icelandic classic rock bands. I've gotten the chance to see some of my idols, from Green Day to Muse. Every show had a different energy and vibe, and I've of course had ones I've enjoyed more and less. The venue of said shows has naturally been a part of that math.\n\nBut never had I hated a concert solely because of the venue, until I saw Muse at Shoreline Amphitheatre.\n\nLet's put aside for a moment the weird corporate vibe the place gives off, with its location on Google's campus and its festival-like promenade of alcohol purveyors and trinket sellers that takes up as much, if not more space than the actual amphitheater on the other side (discounting the lawn). The abject failure of the venue to do right by the concert experience comes back to what makes a rock, or punk, or any other high-energy show so special.\n\nFirst, amphitheaters place you above the musicians you are watching. Ultimately, in the real world, Matt Bellamy is just another person, but on stage he is a rock god, and nothing dashes the image of a rock god into the rocks like looking down on them.\n\nAmphitheaters also have seats, which, in every possible way, is entirely antithetical to the ethos of rock. That's not to say venues shouldn't have seats, or that people who need to sit for any reason shouldn't be able to enjoy a concert. But for all the ways that standing in a pit for hours leaves you with aching legs, it also forces a full-body engagement with the show, an all encompassing experience. What you won't see in a pit during the middle of a song is someone browsing Facebook on their phone, as I saw at Shoreline.\n\nFurther, the existence of the seats means that your tickets are location-dependent, which generally means having your wallet gouged for a decent view, in complete opposition to general admission floor tickets for which queueing early (or some determination) can get you close to your favorite artists.\n\nEven once you're at your seat, and even if it's a seat in a great location, the trouble has only begun. For a rock show, everyone stands. Everyone. Not only because sitting at rock show would be useless, but because if the first row stands, the second can't see unless they stand, and when they stand, the third can't see unless they stand ... and so forth. So now you have a crowd of people perfectly content with standing for the duration of the show, except rather than being next to each other, there are cavernous spaces between every fan and their neighbor.\n\nNothing precludes the inclination to jump, or dance, or pump your fists, like being isolated and surrounding by space. All three are objectively dumb things to be doing with your body, and yet all three become inexplicably awesome when a thousand people are shoulder-to-shoulder moving at once. In a pit, you don't even have a choice in the matter. The band's energy, once deposited into a crowd, becomes your energy. If your neighbors are jumping, your feet will be leaving the ground whether you want them to or not. But you do want them to, because a little bit of help can go a long way in ignoring your inhibitions and truly feeling it.\n\nAt Shoreline, you don't know if your neighbor is singing along, because they're too far away. Gone is the epic wall of sound -- the chorus of chanting fans you can scream your heart out into and feel it get wrapped up in the mix.\n\nAt Muse, I couldn't even hear people singing along to what is one of the band's most popular songs, \"Starlight.\" So I started looking around, and saw the stillness on people's lips. I got a text from my friend up in the lawn, and the guys next to her were napping in the grass. It seemed like half the crowd weren't even there for Muse. Is it self-selection? Do hardcore Muse fans know to avoid Shoreline like the plague, leaving causal passersby to fill the amphitheater?\n\nIt certainly seemed like the band was catering to a more casual audience. Unlike at any other Muse show I've seen, there was an overwhelming predominance of more popular, well-known songs -- a rarity for a band know for changing up its setlists night to night and constantly pulling deeper catalog cuts into its live shows.\n\nI'm not saying there's not a place for amphitheaters in today's concert world. I recently saw Train there, and it was perfectly enjoyable. For pop bands, for country singers, for your favorite '60s band on its reunion tour, Shoreline is perfect. You get the comfort of a seat and a cup holder for your $13 dollar beer. But some bands, some genres, require mind, heart and soul engagement to be truly worthwhile. And for them, Shoreline is nothing but an ax-murderer.", "We are in a moment between techno-rapture and techno-panic. For the last couple of decades we were in such reverential awe of the new technology firms that we allowed them to do as they pleased. Big Tech - Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter - could do no wrong.\n\nOur state of techo-rapture allowed them to get busy doing and enabling things that no one else was allowed: the plundering of our personal data, the exploitation of our intellectual property, the avoidance of our tax laws. They provided platforms that allowed Islamic State to organise attacks on our societies and recruit new terrorists from our suburbs. They stood by as hostile governments used their systems to undermine our democracies.\n\nWhat did we do? For a long time we stood back and applauded. Like the peoples and governments of most Western democracies, Australians fell for the techno-utopian propaganda pumped out of Silicon Valley and Wall Street and the advertising and marketing departments of the firms themselves. These companies were special, they were the future, they were limitless and we shouldn't be Lilliputian-minded enough to try to impose conventional limits on them.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party, itself a master of propaganda, calls such manipulation \"thought work\". It's no coincidence that China has banned Google. And Facebook. Or that Apple made a great show of defying the US government's demand that it open a terrorist's phone for investigators but quietly buckles to Chinese demands. Last month, for instance, it removed from its China app store over 400 apps that allow users to skirt government filters. The Chinese, tougher-minded, simply didn't fall into the same swoon.\n\nRelated Articles The great Australian tradition we must not forget The reassuring message in the German and NZ elections\n\nWe have started to snap out of the rapture. Slowly, Western governments, other industries and some citizens have grasped that Big Tech may be ruthless transnational corporate greed in a new guise, but it is ruthless transnational corporate greed nonetheless.\n\nWestern governments, including Australia's, have started to demand that they shut out terrorists from their systems. We've started to demand that they pay their taxes. They're being called before multiple inquiries in the US Congress to explain why they allowed the Russian government to use their platforms to manipulate the US election campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother of the Big Tech outfits, Uber, had grown so accustomed to operating with impunity that it was shocked when the City of London last week banned it. Uber was not \"fit and proper\", transport authorities said. It was a sign of the times.\n\nAnd this slow awakening is happening just in time for us to be hit with the next meta-trend in the popular psychology of technological change. Robots and artificial intelligence are going to take our jobs and steal our futures. It's the old Luddite techno-phobia. But it's now being repeated to us so often, with such conviction, that it's starting to create great anxiety.\n\nAs my colleague Ross Gittins wrote a few weeks ago: \"You'd have to have been hiding under a rock not to know that 40 per cent of jobs in Australia - about 5 million of them - are likely to be automated in the next 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nThis is because it was the headline finding of a much-publicised 2015 report by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia. Got that? Forty per cent of jobs will disappear. So when Australians aged 18-36 were asked about their work futures, guess what proportion thought that automation posed a threat to their jobs? Forty per cent, according to the Deloitte Millennial Survey this year. Similar studies of the job-stealing potential of robots and artificial intelligence in other countries have come to similar conclusions. Forty, fifty, sixty per cent of jobs will be displaced by smart machines and self-teaching software.\n\nBarack Obama's farewell speech in January stoked the fear: \"The next wave of economic dislocation won't come from overseas,\" he intoned. \"It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.\"\n\n\"Intelligent machines: The jobs robots will steal first\" was the headline on a BBC story, typical of the genre, that ran earlier this month. It ran through a list - factory worker, doctor, cocktail waitress, journalist, taxi driver. The anxiety is building. Techno-panic beckons. But is it well founded?\n\nGittins pointed out the flaw in any economic modelling - your results are only as good as your assumptions. In other words, \"garbage in, garbage out\". He cited economists shooting holes in the basis of the CEDA research. And research by the Paris-based OECD estimated that, across the developed countries, a much smaller 9 per cent of jobs were vulnerable. But this is such a speculative exercise that you can choose your study and pick your number. The McKinsey Global Institute, for instance, estimates that only 5 per cent of occupations will be able to be fully automised by 2065. But it reckons that about half of the activities within occupations will be automatable. So, 95 per cent of occupations will remain but the work within will change. Over the next half-century. You can see why this study didn't get as much publicity as the apocalyptic ones - jobs will change over the next 50 years, nothing too shocking, not many hurt. Hardly a sexy news story.\n\nBut the most important counter to the panic is the evidence of the past three centuries. As each wave of technological change has hit, from the agricultural revolution to the industrial to the digital, many job categories have indeed been wiped out. But many more have been created. So that there has been a net gain every time.The simple fact is that we can always see jobs disappearing but we can never imagine the jobs that will arise in their place.\n\nAustralia should be able to take further reassurance from its recent experiences. Two in particular. First was the 1980s wave of economic reform under the Hawke-Keating governments. As they tore down the tariff wall that had protected Australian industry for a century, we were beset by hysteria. It would mean the death of Australia's manufacturing sector and national ruin. And the end of protectionism did wipe out great swathes of Australia's factories, jobs lost by the tens of thousands. Manufacturing's share of the economy today is half its level of the Hawke-Keating revolution. But rather than national ruin it led to national rejuvenation.\n\nPaul Keating was asked in 2000 what he'd say to blue-collar workers who lost their jobs as a result of his reforms. \"What do I say: What is your new job like? One of the 2.5 million created since the early 1980s. People have found better jobs. I mean, did we ever hurt anybody liberating them from the car assembly line?\"\n\nSecond was the mining boom that ended some four years ago. Every previous Australian mining boom has ended in a bad bust, a national recession. The mighty convulsions in an economy riding a mining boom are like a cowboy trying to hang on to a wildly bucking brumby. This latest boom was the biggest in two centuries of European settlement yet it was the first that did not end in a bust. The newfound flexibility of the economy allowed a smooth dismount.\n\nAustralia has now enjoyed 26 years of unbroken growth, a record for any developed nation. Ah yes, say the prophets of doom, but the tech transformation that is about to hit is unique. This time it's different, they tell us. A book on the subject published this week by a federal Labor MP, Jim Chalmers, and the former head of the NBN, Mike Quigley, tells us so. How? \"Earlier evolutions replaced human effort\" but \"this one goes a step further to directly challenge some some intrinsic traits that make us human - thinking, problem-solving and decision-making\", they write in the book titled Changing Jobs: The Fair Go in the New Machine Age.\n\nGratefully, however, this isn't an exercise in extended hysteria. Chalmers, the shadow finance minister, and Quigley don't waste their book making the ahistorical argument that this time, unlike all other experience, Chicken Little will be proved right and the sky truly will fall. They point out that the world's top experts are split down the middle on whether the new robotics will mean breakdown or boon for the next generations. They cite a survey of 1900 experts by the well-regarded Washington research institute, Pew. Of the experts, 48 per cent saw net job destruction, worsening income inequality, big pools of unemployable people and a breakdown in the social order in just the next eight years. So this time the revolution will be different, in their view.\n\nAnd the other 52 per cent? They foresaw people displaced from some jobs but that human ingenuity would produce new jobs and new industries. In other words, this time it's not different at all. Chalmers and Quigley have chosen not to take sides. Instead, their book, cogent and clear, takes a \"no regrets\" approach to the future.\n\nThey set out 33 policy recommendations that are designed to make Australia a better place regardless of whether the new robots turn out to be benign or bastards. Most of their recommendations are sensible and can indeed be taken up with \"no regrets\". They advocate that we should train more teachers in the STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. And that all states should take up Queensland's \"digital solutions\" curriculum.\n\nRefreshingly, they urge that we sharpen communication skills and critical thinking by promoting debating, drama and advocacy. More venturesome ideas are that Australia should implement lifelong learning accounts, lifelong learning programs like Singapore's SkillsFuture initiative, portable worker entitlements and \"income smoothing\" to better distribute our incomes across our working lifetimes.\n\nSome of their suggestions merely show up the failures of Australia's dismal politics - they recommend, for instance, the implementation of universal high speed national broadband and the introduction of needs-based schools funding. Both of these were supposed to have been substantially delivered already and might have been but for the awful partisan politics of Canberra.\n\nLabor and the left of politics in Australia need to be careful in their embrace of this theme. If they use it as a Trojan horse for intervening in the economy through reregulation of the workplace or other big government intrusions, they will quickly meet the resistance of the Coalition and the right. This would end in yet more bitter brawling and turn a sensible reform opportunity into a national failure. But Chalmers and Quigley have made a good start to a sensible approach. In this moment between techno-rapture and techno-panic, it would be a real achievement to get some techno-sense. To prepare for the new robotics may require, however, the reprogramming of the old robots of Australian politics. It may be too much to ask.\n\nPeter Hartcher is political editor.", "Is it too late for Uber to survive its internal storm, or will its new CEO prove to be the hero it needs?\n\nIt has been several weeks since Dara Khosrowshahi succeeded Travis Kalanick as Uber's CEO. In that time, the deluge of negative headlines has not stopped. More lawsuits have been filed, as well as more accusations of discrimination and misogyny. Even if Khosrowshahi has an overblown hero complex, he must be wondering what he signed up for.\n\nUber is in chaos to a degree that few companies ever find themselves. It is the largest privately held tech company, with a brand that is internationally recognizable, and because it has become part of global culture, their consumers care about the headlines. It does not help that the vultures are circling -- Lyft is actively working to grab jaded Uber customers, and reporters are scrambling to break the next Uber scandal.\n\nBut Uber's biggest problem is not one that consumes the headlines. Uber has a culture problem.\n\nRelated: Uber's New CEO Takes a New Approach, Apologizing for the Company's Past Mistakes\n\n\"Corporate culture is indelibly linked to an organization's brand,\" Deb Gabor writes for Fortune. She goes on to say, \"When your culture is in distress, so is your brand. It's been well acknowledged that Uber has a sick corporate culture that's persisted unchecked by leadership for many years.\"\n\nA sick corporate culture can become malignant when under constant pressure, as Uber has been for the last year. Resurrecting the organization from its tailspin will require visionary leadership that firmly grasps how to invigorate teams of people far from headquarters and redirect attention to the future.\n\nAviv Shahar, founder, and CEO of Aviv Consulting, described the tailspin problem in terms of winning and losing to me over a chat in my Facebook group for entrepreneurs. \"Uber has a winning problem. Yes, they are still the number one ridesharing company in the world, but the Uber team has been rocked by successive scandals for so long that it will need help getting its mojo back. You act differently when you're winning, and it is time for Uber to start winning again. Today's shape-shifting environment is so competitive that no company is secure at the top. An industry leader that loses the wind in its sails can only coast for so long before it loses its grip on the market. Khosrowshahi needs a plan to score some early wins.\"\n\nKalanick, for all his faults, was a winner. In five short years, he built a global empire, conquered adversaries, advanced new technologies and is credited for jump-starting a whole new kind of economy -- the sharing economy. But Uber is short on wins right now. Even its initiatives such sa self-driving cars and Uber Rush are falling on hard times.\n\nRelated: The Guy at the Center of Uber and Google's Legal Battle Created a Church That Worships AI\n\nKhosrowshahi, if he is to be successful, needs to pull off a miracle. Is that a reasonable expectation? Actually, yes it is, and the best CEOs do it all the time. Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 and released the iMac in 1998. Dan Hesse introduced \"Simplify Everything\" to save Sprint in 2008. Henry Ford, one of the original American business titans, doubled salaries in 1914, ignoring critics who said the move would bankrupt the company. In moments of crisis, good executives know how to create a win and change the narrative.\n\nIt goes without saying that your average executive would rather face a sales problem or a branding problem than the \"raging dumpster fire\" that is Uber right now. Solving the problems of culture and morale require finesse and thoughtful listening. It will also require taking calculated risks because Uber cannot afford to become a muted bureaucracy right now either.\n\n\"The new CEO will not succeed if the impending culture changes denude its startup mentality,\" Shahar asserts. \"The new leadership team must be comfortable playing at the edge, making calculated tweaks to make Uber a more inclusive workplace as well as one that embraces independence, initiative and innovation. It is not the only tech company navigating that minefield. Succeeding will necessarily include changing the conversation and casting a vision for a new future that the whole team can create together.\"\n\nRelated: 17 Things You Need to Know About Uber's New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\n\nUber's biggest problems are internal, but it does not have long to set those issues straight. Its external problems cannot wait forever, and those are not just the lawsuits and PR scandals. Uber is facing stiffer competition from rival companies at home and abroad, tighter regulations in Europe, and even revamped taxi companies trying to win back market share. Investors are not as bullish as they were a year ago and want to know what the exit might look like. Worst of all, the arms race to launch a self-driving fleet could bankrupt whoever comes in second place almost overnight.\n\nIt goes without saying that Uber will face those challenges with more agility and confidence if Khosrowshahi can first succeed in revamping the company's culture.", "Project Loon, the initiative of Alphabet's X lab to deliver internet using hot air balloons, is looking into deploying Wi-Fi balloons to help alleviate the crisis in Puerto Rico, the company confirmed. \"The Project Loon team at X is exploring if it's possible to bring emergency connectivity to Puerto Rico,\" the X lab's official Twitter account wrote this afternoon.

And despite the occasional tweet from President Donald Trump claiming Washington is working to provide aid, the administration has not yet said whether it will help repair Puerto Rico's infrastructure. Facebook announced earlier this week that it was sending a connectivity team to Puerto Rico, as well as a $1.5 million donation, to help get the island back on online.\n\nProviding connectivity to areas affected by natural disasters has been one of the core missions of Loon since its inception in 2011. The unit has run pilot programs in New Zealand and Brazil, and it's also partnered with a number of countries, including Indonesia and Sri Lanka, to deploy LTE using its signature air balloons. However, it appears that Loon has never attempted to provide emergency connectivity at the scale Puerto Rico requires. It's unclear to what extent Loon may be able to assist the island, and if its technology is capable of doing so in a way as meaningful as the necessary financial and infrastructural aid the US government could provide.", "Pixel 2 Day is upon us, next week to be exact, with the event kicking off on October 4.

Roku's been growing at a solid clip, and [as] the maker of the No. 1 streaming platform, this may be the best single play on cord-cutting around,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But, and this is a big but, after doing a little digging, candidly, I have some serious reservations about the stock, at least at these prices.\"\n\nRoku pioneered the idea of streaming directly to your television. The company sells a small box that can access 4,500 different streaming channels including Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go.\n\nRoku also licenses its operating system to smart TV manufacturers and cable and satellite companies and has a bustling advertising business selling ad spots and brand sponsorships.\n\nCramer saw some clear positive to Roku's business model. First, the company is central to consumers who are opting out of traditional cable providers and moving to web-based content consumption. Plus, not only is Roku's user base accelerating, but users are progressively watching more and more content.\n\nSecond, while Roku competes with the likes of Google Chromecast, Amazon Alexa and Apple TV, all of its rivals are more focused on other segments of their businesses.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in Apple, but if you're buying it as a cord-cutting play, you are out of your mind because the Apple TV just isn't big enough to move the needle,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThird, the company has a solid balance sheet, and Cramer said the $126 million Roku raised in its IPO makes it look even better.\n\nBut Cramer had to consider the negatives. While Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's Google may not be laser-focused on their streaming products, being caught in their crosshairs hasn't exactly been a positive for companies, he said.\n\nMoreover, Roku's path to profitability doesn't seem crystal-clear. Its revenue may be growing, but the company has been losing money for some time and increasing competition from both the big dogs in tech and gaming consoles that stream video like PlayStation isn't exactly reassuring.\n\nThe company's also torn between two businesses: the platform it licenses, which now accounts for nearly half of Roku's sales, and the box it sells to consumers, sales of which decreased by 15 percent in the first quarter.\n\nCramer said that while moving from hardware to software would be a good strategy for Roku, if it had to sell its players at a loss to do so, it would make it even harder to turn a profit.\n\n\"So there are a lot of question marks about the company. But as for Roku the stock, well, let me just say I don't want you to buy it up here,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"If you got in on the amazing Roku IPO, good for you. You made a fortune. But when you dig deeper into the story, it's clear that there are a lot of things that could trip up investors. I don't want you to get burned. I say take a pass up here. Maybe Roku can transform into a profitable business, but I don't recommend betting money on it. And if you got some on the deal, congratulate yourself.

Ireland disagreed with the proposal and said many Nordic countries had joined it in opposition.\n\nThe issue came to a head last year when the EU ordered Ireland to collect a record 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in taxes from Apple Inc., arguing that it had profited from a system allowing it to escape almost all taxes the EU felt were due.\n\n\"Today the market is dysfunctional. It is not normal that companies make excessive profits and pay nothing in taxes,\" Macron said, painting a situation where the giants of industry were able to profit in Europe and small startups suffered because of it.\n\nThe plan for a tax system that should hit U.S. tech companies harder will be coming up at EU ministerial meetings later this fall and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was convinced a deal would emerge.\n\nThe view is that digital multinationals can play member states against each other to get the best tax deal, leaving them with huge profits and extremely low taxes.\n\n\"We are in a tough situation because of the competition between European nations on this. It is a schizophrenic situation and not common sense,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.\n\n\"Within a short timeframe, it profits them, but it is a short-term vision. If we need a future strategy, we need to look at more harmonization,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland, which is contesting the Apple decision in court, said more taxes were not the answer for the digital challenges facing the continent.\n\n\"If you want Europe to become a digital leader, the solution is not more taxes and more regulation. It is actually the opposite,\" Varadkar said.\n\n\"People bemoan the fact that there is no European Google, no European Facebook, that there is no European LinkedIn,\" Varadkar said. \"If you want those things in Europe and you want those type of companies to come to generate in Europe, it is not through heavy taxes and high regulation.\"", "Facebook shared some of its data regarding Russia's use of its platform to influence the 2016 election with Google, Recode reports.\n\nFacebook shared profiles of Kremlin-linked accounts to help Google with its own investigation into whether Russia used its platforms to interfere in the vote.\n\nIt's still unclear if Google has found evidence of Russian interference.

Samsung committed to the same specification for its flagship Galaxy smartphones; in all, about 90 smartphone models use Qi today, making it the industry's most popular among three standards. In addition to desktop charging stations (typically in the form of small charging pads), the automotive marketplace has also adopted in-cabin wireless charging.\n\nNearly 80 car models, from Audi, Chevrolet and KIA to Hyundai, Nissan and BMW, offer in-cabin wireless charging based on the electromagnetic Qi charging specification.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 public Qi charging locations worldwide, according to the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), the entity in charge of the Qi standard.\n\nMajor brands like McDonald's, Marriott, Ibis and others have built Qi into their properties. Airports, such as London Heathrow, Philadelphia and others around the world, have Qi charging stations. And businesses like Facebook, Google, Deloitte, PwC and Cisco have built Qi into their corporate offices.\n\n\"Over the last few years, one of the major delays for [manufacturers] wanting to introduce wireless charging solutions, particularly in the automotive in-cabin market, is the wait to discover which standard Apple may choose for any wireless-charging-enabled iPhone,\" said Vicky Yussuff, IHS lead analyst for wireless power. \"Now that Apple has decided to use the Qi standard, transmitter shipments into the in-cabin market will likely surge.\"\n\nAlong with third-party wireless charging manufacturers, Apple also plans to release its own AirPower wireless charging station designed to charge up to three Apple products at once, including the iPhone devices, Apple Watch and Apple AirPods through the charging case.\n\nThe number of devices enabled with wireless charging exceeded 200 million units a year for the first time in 2016, according to the latest IHS Markit forecast. Driven by shipments in mobile phones and wearables, that represented a 40% increase over 2015 levels as more consumers experience wireless charging for the first time.\n\nThe 2016 IHS Markit consumer survey showed that one in four people has now used wireless charging, and more than 98% of those would choose the feature again on their next phone. Both consumer demand for the feature and the volume of enabled devices are growing each year.\n\n\"Samsung's success with implementing wireless charging over the last two years coupled with Apple's iPhone announcement this week demonstrates that wireless charging technology is clearly achieving mainstream adoption in the mobile phone market, and the scope of its application is expected to quickly follow suit in other applications,\" Yussuff stated in a recent industry report.\n\nFor several years, restaurants, coffee shops and airports have been piloting the use of wireless charging for customer convenience.\n\nWith wireless charging adoption becoming widespread, the impulse for many users will be to just plop their smartphones down on the charging pad where it will remain fully charged all day long.\n\nIs it bad to fully charge your smartphone?\n\nWith greater ease of charging via wireless technology, the question becomes: Is it bad for your mobile device battery to be fully charged all the time?\n\nVenkat Srinivasan, director of the Argonne Collaborative Center for Energy Storage Science (ACCESS), said that while you cannot overcharge a smartphone or tablet battery, as the electronics will not allow it, keeping it fully charged will hasten its degradation.\n\n\"Frankly, the higher you are in the [charge] state, as you creep up to 90%, 95% to 100% charge, the more degradation the battery will see,\" he said.\n\nAs a lithium-ion battery charges and discharges, ions pass back and forth between a positive electrode (made of lithium-cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate) and a negative electrode (made of carbon graphite).\n\nAs a battery charges, the positive electrode gives off lithium ions that move to the negative electrode and are stored as energy. As the battery discharges, those ions move back to the positive electrode to be used as electricity. As those lithium ions move back and forth, the electrolyte that acts as the transport medium degrades over time.\n\nThe higher the state of charge, the faster the electrolyte degrades, Srinivasan said.\n\nTherefore, it's best not only to keep your smartphone below its top charge, but also to keep the charging and discharging pendulum from swinging wildly.\n\n\"In general, if you swing the battery charge from top to bottom, that's the worst thing you can to for the life of the battery. If you can cycle the battery between 45% and 55% that's the best thing you can do,\" Srinivasan said. \"But, in general, just make sure you don't keep it fully charged.\"\n\nSrinivasan also cautions against being too sensitive to your smartphone or tablet charging. Most smartphone manufacturers design batteries to last two to three years, so if you're a consumer who typically replaces your phone after that amount of time, you don't need to be overly concerned with charging rates.\n\nAs more lithium-ion batteries hit the market, in both consumer electronics and electric vehicles, the rhetoric over whether you should keep those batteries fully charged has heated up, Srinivasan said. His blog posts often receive long comment threads from both sides of the spectrum.\n\n\"The debate between degradation due to high voltage hold vs. degradation due to over-cycling/over-discharge is a hot one,\" Daniel Steingart, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, stated in a recent blog post.\n\nLeaving your smartphone or tablet fully charged will speed the degradation of the battery, he said. But, he added, it's not that simple.\n\nThe damage of fully charging your battery has lessened over time with more sophisticated mobile battery management systems and incremental improvements in the battery cell technology itself, he said. For example, in 2007, when Steingart was a graduate student, taking a battery cell repeatedly to 4.2 volts meant \"an early death\" for it. he said. Today, the same damage to modern battery cells would require at least 4.4 volts.\n\nEven though battery cell technology has improved, there are still too many industry variables to know definitively whether one battery will show greater endurance than another based on continuous charging.\n\n\"We simply don't know, without a complicated tear-down and reverse engineering of the battery and battery management system, what the actual state of charge when the phone says '100%' is,\" Steingart said. \"Some apps give voltage indication, yes, but without knowing the specific formulation and composition of the cathode, we don't know exactly.\"\n\nBMS systems stop a smartphone or tablet from continually charging through the use of a sophisticated algorithm that balances how long the phone will last today vs. how long the battery will last, according to Steingart. If not for BMS technology, constantly charging your phone would kill the battery after a few months, he said.\n\nSteingart argued that the convenience of having a fully charged phone outweighs the risk of long-term battery damage. \"It's generally pretty straightforward to change a battery in a phone or have someone do it for you for [about] $20,\" he said. \"An extra $20 for a few years of convenience? Sign me up.\"\n\nApple charges a bit more for a battery replacement; regardless of the model you own, it's $79. If you have an AppleCare extended warranty, then it's free.\n\n\"Yes, a cell phone is an investment,\" Steingart said, \"but relative to the incremental cost of a new battery, there are much, much more important things to worry about in the world.\"", "Google must take down a mobile phone app that tells Catalan voters where they could vote for Sunday's independence referendum, a judge has ordered.\n\nThe decree was issued by Mercedes Armas of the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia, the magistrate who is leading the legal fight against the referendum, the Europa Press news agency reported on Friday.\n\nIt concerns the \"On Votar 1-Oct'' app on Google Play, which Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont publicised on Twitter two days ago.\n\nSpanish authorities have already taken down hundreds of pro-referendum websites, in what is seen by secessionists as an attack on freedom of expression.", "Congress is taking a closer look at how different technology platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook were used by foreign actors during the 2016 presidential election. On Thursday, Twitter officials found themselves in the hot seat as they testified on Capitol Hill about the company's findings on its role in facilitating Russian influence in the election.\n\nWhat did Twitter find?\n\nIn a blog post on its website, the company said that its internal investigation revealed:\n\nThis news comes weeks after Facebook revealed the results of a similar internal investigation.\n\nWhat did Facebook find?\n\nOn September 6, Facebook announced that its investigation found the following:\n\nFacebook has turned over its findings to Congress. \"We have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary,\" Stamos wrote.\n\nIn a Facebook Live video Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, said the company plans to ramp up its security teams and expand its coordination with global election commissions.\n\nWhat does the Russian government say?\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told the New York Times that Russia was not involved in any way and that the Kremlin does not even know how to buy Facebook ads. \"We have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this,\" he said.\n\nIs the U.S. the only country that has had these issues with Facebook?\n\nDefinitely not. The company has been called on to police fake news content during elections in countries like the U.K., France and Germany. Earlier this month, Facebook said that it removed \"tens of thousands\" of fake accounts in Germany prior to its election.\n\nIs this why Russia is threatening to ban Facebook?\n\nNo. Russia is saying that the reason why Facebook could be banned in 2018 is because it is not complying with its local storage laws. Any company that collects any personal information about Russian citizens must store it on Russian soil. Facebook is not the first tech company to be threatened under this law. According to CNN, this is the reason why LinkedIn was banned in Russia last year.\n\nSo what's next?\n\nProbably a lot more hearings. The Senate, for one, did not seem happy with Twitter's answers on Thursday.\n\n\"I am more than a bit surprised in light of all the public interest in this subject over the last few weeks that anyone from the Twitter team would think that the presentation they made to the senate staff today even began to answer the kind of questions that we'd asked,\" said Mark Warner, a Democratic Senator from Virginia.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has invited executives from Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) to appear at a public hearing on November 1, according to CNBC. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee also said it will be holding a hearing to \"better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election.\"\n\nRelated What we pay for when we pay for a special investigation Bloomberg: Russian election interference is more widespread than thought Three things you need to know about the U.S.-Russia relationship", "For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google's latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project.\n\nIt is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28. Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +. But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users. And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily \"get\" the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since. Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket.\n\nThe site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right. Google's previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off. Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example. Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site. They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos.\n\nWho is on Google+ now?\n\nIt still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female. Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+. The \"digital elite\" , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies, made up the earliest invitees. This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians. In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave. Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a healthy representation on Google+ now as well. Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site.\n\nBut beyond these audacious early users, many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive. Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest.\n\nGoogle+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think. It certainly is not as turnkey as Facebook. With Facebook, anyone can pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up. Not so much with Google +. In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site. A killer competitor to Facebook shouldn't be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and \"friending\" long lost classmates and relatives. It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active folks to adopt Google +. So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits.\n\nBut then again, not all people \"got\" Twitter initially either. Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over, some reports say. An Edison Research annual report on Twitter showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general. A Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively.\n\nGoogle+ shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race. When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want.\n\nSocial media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn't think Google+ will be Twitter killer.\n\n\"People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won't abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can't compete,\" Holmes said. \" If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.\"\n\nHolmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more. \"We are people that need usability and understand usability,\" she added.\n\nIt is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook. They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform. They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+.\n\nGoogle+, the place to go to escape the \"ghettoization\" of other social media platforms\n\nIn essence, if Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook's 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace. According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too \"ghetto\" and used by blacks and Hispanics. She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing \"digital\" white flight, the Digital Race Anthology.\n\nIn White Flight in Networked Publics? How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a \"white flight\" from MySpace because it had become too brown.\n\nCurrently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole. Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites. Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch's Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs. He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites - Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it. A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK's Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users. But those who stayed, did so by choice. As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn't and why they did not join it when everyone else was.\n\nFacebook is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter.\n\nBut as mentioned, recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites.\n\nUsing this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide.\n\nWhile idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services.\n\nAre minorities positioned to be left behind?\n\nSince Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world. Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being \"followed\" by hundreds or thousands on Google+. When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer. There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms. Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely.\n\nMany of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable. When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh.\n\n\"There goes the neighborhood,\" one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, \"As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.\"\n\nThese retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics. While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can't afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook's 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters.\n\nWhen the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately? It may not matter.\n\nGoogle+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook. Only time will tell.", "Despite the importance of the Chinese market is to the global games infrastructure, and how many publishers are trying to buy into the region before it's too late, China itself still seems a little bit unknowable.\n\nWestern developers have long been localizing for the Japanese market, and the ground zero of the eSports revolution is fixed squarely on Seoul. But a mixture of censorship, restrictive government policy, and genuine differences in taste has kept the China's games culture remote.\n\nSince 2002, Niko Partners has studied and interpreted Chinese gaming trends, filling the gaps and answering the questions for anyone interested in bringing their product across the Pacific. I recently caught up with senior analyst and China director Zeng Xiaofeng, and asked him what he thought were some of the crucial things Western publishers need to understand when trying to break into the games market in China.\n\nThe first, and arguably the most imperative thing Xiaofeng detailed is the labyrinthine process of successfully (and legally) licensing a video game in China. Despite the country's notable flirtations with the free market, all mobile games that enter the Chinese public forum must be pre-approved by the government, or more specifically, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television.\n\nSome of the restrictions are notably arcane. For instance, all the text in games released in China must be written entirely in Chinese. Also, in order for a company to receive their revenue, they need to secure a very specific license from the government. The only problem is that those licenses aren't available to foreigners.\n\nAs of July 1st, the arduous process involves completing an application, sending it to provincial authorities for approval, who will then forward it along to the municipal office for another once-over, before being sent back down the chain for a final handover. \"There is so much red tape that it filled a 100-page regulatory report we released,\" says Xiaofeng.\n\nDungeon & Fighter is still popular in China a decade after its debut\n\nIn the West, we pretty much download our apps through either the App Store, or the Google Play Store. Those two platforms are built into our phones, and it seems extremely unnecessary to seek out an externalized merchant. But that's not the case for Chinese Android phones. The country has a massive third-party app store industry, and it can be really difficult to get your head around.\n\nThe sector makes sense when you think about it. Google has been blocked in China since 2014, so naturally, other tech companies native to the region flocked in to fill the gap. Xiaofeng tells me that if you're going to launch a successful Android game in China, you'll need an intrinsic knowledge of the myriad consumer choices.\n\nTo give you some sense of the app store industry's depth, here are some of the major players. Baidu, which shares a name and ownership with the China's largest search engine. Tencent, the company that purchased Riot Games, runs the massive social networking site WeChat. Then there's Wandoujia, a startup with over $120 million in VC funding.\n\nWandoujia CEO at recent keynote\n\nWe've heard horror stories about people who hole up in Internet cafes to play MMOs for days on end. But Xiaofeng says that many internet cafes in small or mid-sized Chinese cities serve utilitarian purposes - they are literally the only way some people can play games.\n\nXiaofeng believes that the setups at the more elaborate cafes in cosmopolitan areas of China are a window into future market opportunities in the West. There, cafes are outfitted with the horizontal, 5v5 set-up you might be familiar with from live eSports broadcasts. \"They are great for eSports viewing and participation, and for coaching as well,\" says Xiaofeng. \"In the US, they hardly exist at this time, but I feel that more will be built with the high-end eSports focus in mind.\"\n\nCross Fire is another title that's been a consistent hit in China for over a decade\n\nThe Japanese and Western gaming markets are pretty diverse. You've got epic, fully immersive single-player adventures like Final Fantasy and Horizon: Zero Dawn, annualized sports franchises like Madden and FIFA, and casual multiplayer endeavors that run the gamut from Call of Duty to Gang Beasts. That's not exactly the case in China.\n\nXiaofeng tells me that gamers in the People's Republic prefer long, grind-y persistent experiences. \"Chinese players love to level up and be competitive,\" says Xiaofeng. \"To the point that they would rather turn off the graphics if it helps speed up gameplay in order to level up faster.\"\n\nIn 2015 TechInAsia reported that the most popular PC games in China were the free-to-play Korean first-person shooter Crossfire, the massively-multiplayer isometric beat 'em up Dungeon & Fighter, and (of course,) League of Legends. There's a real commitment to games. These are the exact same three games that were the most popular in China back in 2013. Dungeon & Fighter and Crossfire were released in 2005 and 2007 respectively, and League of Legends has been available in China for eight years.\n\nXiaofeng also notes that Chinese gamers are turned off by realistic imagery, and instead prefer their content to be drawn with \"anime-style graphics and cartoon-style avatars.\" But despite this general preference, and all of the cultural affinities Ziaofeng highlights, it's telling that PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is currently one of the top-streamed games on the Chinese streaming site Douyo.

As the clock approached midnight Aug. 30, Hollywood commissioners voted to rename streets named in the 1920s for Nathan Bedford Forrest, John Bell Hood and Robert E.

Businesses pledged over $224.9 million to relief efforts following Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, according to a recent estimate from the Chamber.\n\nNevertheless, major companies have continued to donate in the wake of Maria.\n\nOn Friday, JPMorgan Chase announced a $500,000 donation to organizations working on the ground, like the Community Foundation of Puerto Rico and the local Boys and Girls Club. Verizon on Friday upped its donation to $5 million from $1 million for the island.\n\nCompanies like healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente and pharmaceutical company Abbott are each contributing $1 million to relief efforts. Starbucks, which has 500 employees on the island, will give $250,000 to recovery and rebuilding in Puerto Rico, and Google is matching the $250,000 employees have raised for a total of $500,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Coca-Cola has tripled the amount of money it's donating to disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Maria and the earthquakes in Mexico. The company will donate another $4.3 million to help with recovery. It had previously announced a $2 million contribution to the American Red Cross for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and that it would match employee donations up to $100,000.\n\nAmgen, a biotechnology company, has pledged $3 million to support urgent Hurricane Maria relief efforts in Puerto Rico.

Its all-too-familiar worries have taken 14 percent off its stock market, although news in recent days that banks there will be spared another stress test, at least for now, has eased some of the pressure.", "September has been a terrible month for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) as the brand has been dragged through the mud on two separate scandals.\n\nFirst, the social network was found to have allowed inauthentic Russian ads on its website that tried to influence voters during the presidential campaign. Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg had vigorously denied that its website had been infiltrated, but an internal investigation revealed that about $100,000 had been spent on about 3,000 ads posing to be from activists, but that were really from Russian sources.\n\nA week later, a ProPublica investigation found that the social network's ad-targeting allowed advertisers to select anti-Semitic users.\n\nImage source: Facebook.\n\nBoth items stoked outrage against the social media giant and once again painted a portrait of a company whose influence was out of control, being run by algorithms instead of people.\n\nFacebook exacerbated the problem by initially refusing to share the bulk of the Russian ads, though it later said it would. The news also increased calls for greater oversight and regulation of Facebook, and similar demands have been building for other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon.com.\n\nYou might think such news would roil Facebook shares, but the stock has barely flinched in the last month.\n\nFB data by YCharts.\n\nFacebook remains just a few points away from its all-time high.\n\nA bulletproof business model\n\nPlenty of analysts have said that such events make Facebook vulnerable, but the company has a base of 2 billion users around the globe, many of whom go on the social network every day. They depend on Facebook and its products to communicate with friends and family, share photos, and follow the news.\n\nReally, the only way such scandals could hurt Facebook is if they force it to lose users or advertisers.\n\nWhile millions of Facebook users are likely dismayed that the social network became a pawn in the election, or that its algorithm was used in a racist way, those incidents ultimately don't affect their experiences with the social network, so it's unlikely to change their behavior.\n\nEven if they were disgusted enough with Facebook to leave it, they would most likely switch to Instagram, a Facebook property that is the world's second most popular social network and now has 800 million users. Instagram Stories has also succeeded in neutralizing the threat from Snap Inc's (NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, which is the closest thing to a rival Facebook has faced in years.\n\nAs far as messaging apps go, Facebook also dominates there thanks to WhatsApp, which has over 1 billion daily users. In other words, it's not so easy to find Facebook's services like messaging and photo-sharing elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisers, meanwhile, follow eyeballs, and they are unlikely to abandon a platform with 2 billion users, especially when it allows for such precise targeting. Want to get your message out to female wine drinkers, ages 25-34, in a specific zip code? Facebook can do that, and it does it better than anyone else. The information on its users and that targeting capability has separated the company from competitors like Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and Google, who just don't have the same level of user knowledge and therefore can't match its targeting.\n\nFinally, the regulatory threat seems minimal at this point. Though Facebook may be something of a social media monopoly, especially with its ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, it's not one that can easily be broken up. Making 10 smaller Facebooks instead of one big one would not be in the public interest, and the company's massive user base is not eliminating choices or raising prices for either consumers or advertisers -- Facebook's real customers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Russia scandal, the social network announced changes to how it will handle political ads. The company said it would make those ads viewable by anyone, not just those who are targeted, and said it would require political advertisers to disclose funding, a rule that currently applies to television ads but not social media.\n\nThose changes should quell the uproar for now, but Facebook will likely face similar challenges as its importance and influence in the media grows. While this is probably not the last time Facebook will spark outrage, investors should take heart knowing that such events do little to threaten the company's underlying business.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The measure followed a yearlong Chicago Tribune investigation that examined how various factors involving young drivers contributed to traffic fatalities.\n\nThe law sought to curb the riskiest behavior by 16- and 17-year-olds, which research showed included groups of teens traveling in vehicles at night at high speeds.\n\nThere's a tendency among adolescents to show off to their friends. Some outgrow the urge to engage in one-upmanship. Others don't.\n\n\"Hold my beer,\" is a punch line to many jokes about the stupid desire to gain a sense of superiority over another person.\n\nSome of the behavior I see on social media reminds me of teenagers trying to impress one another.\n\nI regularly see people trying to outperform others. Pick a hot-button issue like race or immigration and watch people devise new ways to insult one another. Some friends egg them on, until sometimes a line is crossed.\n\nThis, I think, is what leads to some people losing their jobs over something posted on social media.\n\n\"What were they thinking when they posted that?\" I sometimes wonder.\n\nThis has been going on for years. I know some people are genuinely speaking from their hearts about issues that inspire passion.\n\nNow, however, we're presented with mounting evidence supporting allegations a foreign adversary is manipulating us into some of these heated debates taking place on social media. A foe with a deep understanding of human nature wants us to argue, fight with one another and resent fellow countrymen.\n\nI believe understanding the group dynamics of social media is key to formulating a response to how Russia is allegedly exploiting cultural divisions to their advantage.\n\nIn case you missed it, here's a summary of some of the recent evidence that the Russians are playing us.\n\nWhile much attention was focused in the past week on a controversy over national anthem protests, Twitter representatives met Thursday behind closed doors with House and Senate intelligence committee members investigating alleged Russian meddling in our 2016 election.\n\n\"The presentation that the Twitter team made to the Senate Intel staff today was deeply disappointing,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told reporters after the meeting. He said Twitter's response was \"frankly inadequate on almost every level.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump ignited a furor over national anthem protests during a speech in Alabama on Sept. 22, one day after Facebook announced it would give Congressional investigators information about more than 3,000 ads it sold to Russian-linked accounts.\n\n\"The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook,\" Trump Tweeted on Sept. 22, the same day he spoke in Alabama.\n\nRussian agents paid Facebook $100,000 for ads during the election, Facebook said. At least one of the ads targeted people in Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., and sought to inflame racial unrest, CNN reported.\n\n\"Their aim was to sow chaos,\" Warner told The Washington Post.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday he now regrets how he responded to initial claims that Russians were using his company to sway public opinion in America.\n\n\"After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it. This is too important an issue to be dismissive,\" he said in a Facebook post.\n\nCongressional investigators now want representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Google's parent company Alphabet to testify at a public hearing about how Russia uses their services.\n\nThose sneaky Russians also are suspected of trying to influence elections in other countries and stoking cultural divisions in other parts of the world.\n\nPretty soon we're going to have to figure out what we're going to do about it.\n\nSome want to ignore the mounting evidence. It's a \"crazy idea\" or \"fake news.\"\n\nSome are certain Russia is attacking our democracy. Others take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nI'm concerned that nearly 11 months after the presidential election and with little more than a year to go before the 2018 midterm national elections, we still don't know the full extent of what the Russians did to us in 2016 and the tactics they may still be using today.\n\nI think it would be wise to proceed cautiously. While criminal experts and Congress continue their investigations, the rest of us can examine how we conduct ourselves on social media.\n\nBy all means, express your views. Feel free to argue, defend and persuade. If you're certain your view is the right view, do your best to influence public debate on the topic.\n\nAll I ask is for you to imagine for a moment that you're a kid in the backseat of a car on a long road trip with siblings next to you.\n\n\"Mom, Dad, so-and-so won't stay on their side of the line,\" you might complain.\n\nConsider the possibility that while you're thinking of new ways to insult your brother or sister, a little voice from outside the family is whispering in your ear.\n\n\"You're being treated unfairly,\" the voice says. \"They're getting more than you. They're not working as hard as you.\"\n\nThe voice doesn't care about you. It only wants you to fight. It wants you to kick and scream and cause a ruckus until your parents are exasperated.\n\nThat's how clever adversaries divide and conquer. They get people to fight over issues. They know some people act like teenagers showing off, or dumb adults trying to impress their peers.\n\nThey'll trick some people into acting like idiots by leading them to believe their superiority is threatened.\n\ntslowik@tronc.com\n\nTwitter @tedslowik"]}, "Allianz": {"2017-09-28": ["From left: David Weinreb, Joe Sitt, Francis Greenburger, Larry Silverstein and Nelson Mills\n\nBlockbuster deals like HNA Group's $2.21 billion purchase of 245 Park Avenue may be going the way of the dodo bird as the flow of institutional Chinese cash in the United States slows to a trickle.\n\n\"I think that was a freak last deal,\" Joseph Sitt, CEO of Thor Equities, said. He noted that the Chinese government has started cracking down on the billionaire CEOs of some of the most active investors, including Anbang Insurance Group and the Wanda Group. \"I think a lot of that funny money is gone.

Peter Sotoloff, managing partner and chief investment officer of Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies, said that the interest rate hikes will level-off asset values.\n\n\"We've been fed a lot of crack cocaine to support asset values over the past 7 to 8 years,\" Sotoloff said. \"It's been artificially inflating asset value.\"\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Trump outlined his proposal for sweeping tax cuts, but many details on the plan remain unclear. William Mack, chairman of the board of directors at Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, said some of the proposal \"could really send real estate on its ear.\" (The Real Estate Board of New York has spoken out against the president's proposal to eliminate deductions of real estate property taxes from homeowners' taxable income. The group says the change will make New York and the country less competitive for real estate investment.)\n\nSitt noted that various markets have reacted to the dynamics of the Trump administration -- such as whether Steve Bannon or Jared Kushner had more influence in the White House.\n\n\"I think it's gotten to the point where the markets have given up,\" he said.\n\nThe panelists also discussed their migration to other markets. Sitt said he views the East Coast market as \"troubled\" and has largely focused on the West Coast, Latin America and Europe. Nelson Mills, president and CEO of Columbia Property Trust, noted his company's recent partnership with Allianz Real Estate to acquire class-A office properties on West Coast.\n\n\"The New York office-based REITs are getting hammered,\" Mills said. \"The public markets have spoken, and New York is out of favor for the time being.\"\n\nAs for international investment, Mack said he's hopeful that the U.S. won't \"close [its] borders to international investment\" but is troubled by a global rise in nationalism.\n\n\"I see it happening for China right now, they are trying to keep their money there. The banks are getting queasy about loaning to real estate of any kind, especially retail, and secondarily office,\" he said. \"I have grave concern that the next step will be a diminution of capital coming into the country or capital that is available in the country for real estate lending.\"", "Warren Buffett may have won his decade-long bet against hedge funds, but can his advice to investors to use only low-cost index funds beat the red-hot record of wealth managers?\n\nReaders of the 2017 Capgemini World Wealth Report, released on Thursday, will be shaking their heads.\n\nHigh-net-worth individuals reported an average 24 percent return last year on assets managed by wealth firms, according to the study. The figure for Asia-Pacific outside of Japan was a staggering 33 percent -- or 26 percentage points in excess of what the regional MSCI index returned. The rich, it would appear, are better off listening to their advisers. Self-directed accounts performed less well, while the Oracle of Omaha's cheap do-it-yourself toolkit is intended for those who don't have the minimum $1 million to invest.\n\nThese figures, however, give a vastly exaggerated account of wealth managers' prowess. It's entirely possible that the outperformance, as Capgemini's own previous surveys have shown, is being driven partly by leverage. The rich in Asia-Pacific are world leaders when it comes to using credit to make investments. Global household debt topped 40 trillion euros ($47 trillion) for the first time last year, thanks mainly to a 17 percent jump in Asia-ex-Japan, according to Allianz SE. Nor was this a flash in the pan: The figure has grown at a 10-year average of 14.5 percent.\n\nHow much longer can a debt-fueled wealth accumulation spree continue? For one thing, liquidity won't be this inexpensive or abundant forever; for another, hit trades are overcrowded.\n\nA third home -- or a shopping mall for that matter -- isn't what moneyed Asians are after. They've been wary of real estate for some time now. Over the past five years, the region's affluent have pared back allocations to property and doubled down on equity. China's high-net-worth market is still hooked on principal-protected trust funds, even though returns are dwindling. Fixed income accounted for 71 percent of the $5 billion of wealth management products distributed last quarter by Noah Holdings Ltd., the mainland's leading adviser to the rich outside of the private-banking industry.\n\nIn addition to high leverage and crowded trades, clients themselves provide a second reason to take wealth managers' astounding returns with a grain of salt. In Asia, as many as 75 percent of high-net-worth individuals who already have advisers won't mind opening an account with the likes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. or Amazon Inc., should the tech czars use their expertise in big data and artificial intelligence to grow wealth-management wings. Or at least that's what they told Capgemini.\n\nPut that yearning for a tech revolution down to the wealth management industry's caste system. Returns last year were 10 percentage points higher for those with $20 million or more in assets than for those who could only spare between $1 million and $5 million. For the poorest of the rich, chatbots that use algorithms to spread money across inexpensive exchange-traded funds may make more sense than paying through the nose for a human wealth adviser.\n\nWhen it comes to the mass affluent, the Buffett DIY approach may be one up on wealth managers, too.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "Follow @insidefutbol\n\nTom Boyd is hopeful that Celtic can spring a surprise against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\n\nThe Bhoys gave their group stage campaign a shot in the arm on Wednesday night when recording an impressive 3-0 win away at Anderlecht, while Bayern Munich went down 3-0 at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti paid with his job at Bayern Munich following the defeat and Celtic are now level on points with the Bavarians in their group, with each side boasting three.\n\nBoyd thinks Celtic now have their confidence back in Europe and little will be expected when they travel to the Allianz Arena, meaning the pressure is off.\n\nAnd Boyd stressed Celtic have beaten better teams than the Germans at Celtic Park, promising hope for the reverse fixture.\n\n\"It's a tough ask, but I would say we have beaten better teams here at Celtic Park\", Boyd said on Celtic TV when asked if the Bhoys can challenge Bayern Munich for second spot in the group.\n\n\"We're flying domestically and we've got our confidence back from that victory last night, so we can go to the Allianz and nobody will expect us to do anything.\n\n\"We would prefer it if it was Celtic Park, but we've got a lot of confidence\", he added.\n\nAssistant boss Willy Sagnol has moved into the hot seat at Bayern Munich on a temporary basis.\n\nThe Bavarians are currently placed third in the Bundesliga.", "There are risks to the market rally, but they'll have to materialize in a \"big way\" to have an effect, Allianz's Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC.\n\nThere are risks to the market rally, but they'll have to materialize in a \"big way\" to have an effect, noted economist Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nHe believes there is a \"whole list of uncertainties\" facing the market right now, including geopolitics, nationalism and the question of what happens if more than one central bank normalizes policy at the same time.\n\nHowever, he told \" Closing Bell \" there is also \"so much liquidity and there's so much conditioning of investors to buy on dips.\"\n\n\"You need a big shock in order to derail this market,\" the chief economic advisor at Allianz said.\n\nThe market has run up since President Donald Trump was elected to office in November, with the Dow Jones industrial average advancing more than 20 percent.\n\nEl-Erian said the biggest vulnerability is that asset prices have decoupled from fundamentals.\n\n\"Fundamentals are improving but asset prices have rushed ahead of that improvement,\" he said.\n\nThat's why he thinks tax reform is important, because it is key to have economic polices out of Washington and European capitals that actually generate high and inclusive growth.\n\n\"That's what ultimately will make sure that we get a smooth transition.

In Asia, Taiwan was second only to Japan, whose net financial assets per capita were assessed at 96,890 euros. It was the nation's best ranking to date, with the household asset growth rate tripling to 10 percent since 2015.

Addressing the hearing, Mr O'Grady outlined a number of issues he wanted to address before the beginning of the formal inquest.\n\nHe said he would be fully reviewing the report claiming first responders could not open the vehicle's doors, as well as reports by Donegal County Council into its piers and slipways and others by the Road Safety Authority and the Irish Water Safety Authority.\n\nMr O'Grady asked coroner Denis McCauley to release all 57 draft witness depositions, calling the case \"most unfortunate and unusual\". \"We have to ensure that something like this never happens again,\" he added.\n\n\"The when and where will not be an issue, but the how and surrounding circumstances will be an issue here.\n\n\"I feel this is a case if ever there was a case for a more extensive disclosure than you may be prepared to grant.\n\n\"I need to hear what the people on the scene heard, saw and what the condition of the place was.\"\n\nMr McCauley said he was usually quite liberal with allowing depositions for an inquest.\n\nThose who lost their lives were Sean McGrotty, his sons Mark (11) and eight-year-old Evan, his mother-in-law Ruth Daniels and her daughter Jodie-Lee Tracey (15).\n\nMr McGrotty's baby Rionaghac-Ann was saved when her father passed her out of the window to local man Davitt Walsh, who bravely swam out to the sinking car.", "MILAN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Italy's Assicurazioni Generali will not present an offer to become the new insurance partner of the country's third-largest bank, Banco BPM , two sources said.\n\nEarlier this month, a source said Generali was expected to be among four bidders together with smaller rival Cattolica , Germany's Allianz and France's Covea.\n\nCattolica said on Wednesday it had filed a binding bid for the \"bancassurance\" partnership, offering to buy a majority of Popolare Vita and Avipop Assicurazioni.

It is unquestionably the best, and indeed the only sustainable, means of increasing the living standards of everyone in a country.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close\n\n8.15am BST 08:15\n\nThe agenda: Bank of England celebrates 20 years of independence\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.\n\nA gaggle of the world's top central bankers and other luminaries have descended on the City of London to help the Bank of England mark its 20th year of independence, and plot the way ahead.\n\nOver the next two days BoE governor Mark Carney will be joined by Mario Draghi (ECB), Stanley Fischer (US Federal Reserve), Guy Debelle (Australia), Christine Lagarde (IMF), Mohamed El-Erian (Allianz) and Ed Balls ( Strictly Come Dancing Harvard Kennedy School).\n\nEd Balls, of course, was a driving force behind the surprise decision to grant the Bank of England independence back in 1997. Gordon Brown, then chancellor, shocked the City and Westminster by announcing that he would hand control of interest rates to the BoE.\n\nLater today, Brown will look back on that landmark decision to give Threadneedle Street operational control of monetary policy.\n\nAs my colleague Larry Elliott reported at the time:\n\nMr Brown said last night that the objectives of policy were 'high and stable levels of employment and growth', the same as they had been in the 1940s when the Bank was nationalised, but added: 'It is right in the 1990s to deal with them in modern ways.'\n\nMark Carney is also likely to defend criticism of the Bank's independence. Some argue, powerfully, that central bankers now have too much power, and are exacerbating wealth inequality through policies such as quantitative easing.\n\nLast year, Ed Balls co-authored an academic paper on this, and arguing that a new \"systemic risk\" committee should be set up to oversee some of the Bank's activity.\n\nAs he put it:\n\n\"I think the case for independent central banks is as strong as it's ever been. At a time of economic uncertainty but also great political risk, we need the [US] Fed and the Bank of England to play these roles.\n\nBut the reforms we've seen over the last few years have hugely concentrated power in central banks. I think it's unfinished business.\"\n\nStudents of politics may note that the Bank is rather late with its celebrations. Brown granted independence on 7 May, less than a week after the election. But still, any excuse for a party, I guess.\n\nThe full agenda is online here. Here are some highlights:\n\n9am BST: Welcome remarks from Mark Carney, followed by a speech by Theresa May defending free markets. 10:00am BST: Central bank independence in retrospect, with Guy Debelle (Reserve Bank of Australia), Gus O'Donnell (Frontier Economics); Andrew Tyrie (former Chair of Treasury Select Committee); Charles Goodhart (LSE), DeAnne Julius (University College London); Frances O'Grady (Trade Union Congress). 11.45am BST: Gordon Brown keynote speech: The history of independence\n\n1.45pm BST: Does the model remain fit for purpose?

South Africa has \u20ac531 billion in gross financial assets, a 4.7% increase from 2016, the report said.\n\nThe United States topped the table with net financial assets per capita of \u20ac177,210, followed by Switzerland, with \u20ac175,720. Japan was third with \u20ac96,890.\n\nSwitzerland, swapped places with the US for gross financial assets per capita, with Denmrk ranked third.\n\nSouth Africa's net financial assets per capita, is higher than other BRICS countries except for China, Allianz said.\n\nHowever, its net financial assets of households grew by only 5.3% - one of the slowest rates among the BRICS countries, which is also below the average of advanced markets.\n\n\"The growth of liabilities slowed down to 3.2% as South African households continued to show some debt discipline. This has resulted in the debt ratio falling below 45% for the first time in ten years,\" the financial services company said.\n\nEven though the country's households have trimmed their debt ratio by 10% over the last decade, its overall level remains elevated, and higher than the emerging market average of around 35%.\n\nAllianz pointed out that the country's relatively high average wealth has to be taken with a pinch of salt, as it is one of the countries where wealth is unevenly distributed.\n\nMore than 70% of all net financial assets are owned by 10% of the population at the top of the wealth distribution. Globally, only the US displays a higher share of wealth, while the global average is about 53%, it said.\n\nNet per capita financial assets vs gross per capita financial assets:", "China's newly wealthy families favour real estate, equities, study says\n\nThe wealth of Chinese families has increased sharply over the past year, underscoring the rising prosperity of the nation's middle class, but also raising concerns over rising debt levels, according to an annual survey by Allianz.\n\nIn its latest Global Wealth Report, the German insurer estimated that China's households recorded 17.9 per cent growth in financial assets last year, lifting the nation's gross financial assets to \u20ac22.649 trillion (US$26.344 trillion).\n\nAssets held by private banks in China surge 22pc in value\n\nChina ranked the No 2 fastest growing country worldwide in terms of percentage gains in financial assets, following Argentina's 54.1 per cent growth.\n\nHowever, Chinese households liabilities rose by 23 per cent and now account for 61 per cent of the total liabilities of Asia excluding Japan, said Allianz.\n\n\"Though [Chinese households'] overall debt ratio of 45.1 per cent is still comparatively low, the pace of the increase gives cause for concern,\" said Allianz chief economist Michael Heise said in the Global Wealth Report.\n\nFinancial assets that were factored in by Allianz's report include cash and bank deposits, receivables from insurance companies and pension institutions, securities and other receivables.\n\n\"Chinese households continued to diversify their asset portfolio away from deposits to more profitable wealth management products and securities, which profited from the gradual recovery of the stock markets,\" the report said.\n\nThe report cautioned over rising debt levels, noting that 2017 was the first year since 2009 that global debt rose faster than GDP.\n\nIt noted rising debt levels in China brought on by broader access to financial services through all levels of society.\n\n\"The observed lending growth could also be taken as a sign of increasing financial deepening,\" said Allianz.\n\nWith net wealth per capita

His tactical philosophy chimes with Bayern's expectations, and club chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has expressed admiration for Tuchel in the past.\n\nHe will also bring the sense of urgency and tactical micro-management which the Bayern players enjoyed under Pep Guardiola, and have missed under Ancelotti.\n\nThe Bayern bosses may be wary of Tuchel's combative character; at both Mainz and Dortmund, he left with his relationship to the hierarchy in tatters.\n\nOn the other hand, Rummenigge and Hoeness have dealt with worse. Most importantly of all, Tuchel is the one of the few candidates who is currently out of work, so there is little to stop him beginning work next month.\n\nEx-Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel is favoured by many at Bayern to take over at the Allianz\n\nJulian Nagelsmann\n\nThe 30-year-old has shot to prominence with his success at Hoffenheim in the last 18 months, and is generally considered to be a superstar coach in the making.\n\nMany expect him to one day take over at Bayern, and Nagelsmann himself has made no bones about the fact that it would be his dream job. It is unlikely, however, that he would jump ship at Hoffenheim now, having just begun a first Europa League campaign. Bayern would probably have to wait until next summer if Nagelsmann is their man.\n\n'I haven't engaged with it all, I don't concern myself with speculation,' he said last night of Ancelotti's dismissal.\n\nHoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann is the early bookies' favourite replace the Italian full-time\n\nJurgen Klopp\n\nLiverpool fans may not be happy with this one, but many in Germany think that Klopp is the man to pull Bayern out of the mire.\n\nEven during his time at Dortmund, Klopp was perennially linked with Bayern. This week, Bild described him as 'the ideal solution' to the mess in Munich.\n\n'Bayern need a personality who can deal with superstars and youngsters alike,' wrote one columnist. 'They need someone who brings a lot of passion and a clear idea of how to play. Klopp fits all of those criteria.'\n\nReds fans can probably rest easy, though. As with Nagelsmann, it is highly unlikely that Klopp would desert his current post for a risky role in Munich.\n\nMany in Germany think that Jurgen Klopp is the man to pull Bayern out of the mire\n\nWilly Sagnol\n\nThe former Bayern full-back was promoted from assistant to interim coach after Ancelotti's dismissal this week. He will take charge for Sunday's fixture against Hertha Berlin.\n\nThough it is unlikely that Bayern would trust such a coaching novice with almost an entire season, Sagnol may be useful middle-term solution.\n\nIf they are serious about going after Klopp or Nagelsmann next summer, then they will need someone to fill the gap between now and then - a role which the likes of Tuchel would certainly refuse. Sagnol is also a company man, and knows both the club and the team well.\n\nBefore he was given the post of Ancelotti's assistant last summer, he correctly identified that the team lacked a clear philosopy, and criticised the Italian's aversion to using young players.\n\nAncelotti's assistant Willy Sagnol takes over on a temporary basis from the Italian manager\n\nLuis Enrique\n\nWinning the treble with Barcelona is enough to ensure you are always linked to the top jobs, so Luis Enrique's name has been popping up all over the place in the last 48 hours.\n\nLike Tuchel, Enrique is currently out of work, and would be able to take over more or less immediately.

Bloomberg Gadfly", "Konservative Prognosen. Bei W\u00fcstenrot & W\u00fcrttembergische - kurz W&W - ist es fast jedes Jahr das gleiche: Die anf\u00e4ngliche Prognose zum Gesch\u00e4ftsgang ist zur\u00fcckhaltend, im Laufe eines Jahres wird sie dann nach oben geschraubt und am Ende sogar noch \u00fcbertroffen. 2016 war das so, 2015 ebenfalls und auch 2014. Und 2017 macht da wohl keine Ausnahme.\n\nNachdem der Versicherungs- und Bausparkonzern aus Stuttgart die urspr\u00fcngliche Ergebnisprognose von 200 Millionen Euro f\u00fcr 2015 mit einem Jahres\u00fcberschuss von 274,3 Millionen Euro klar \u00fcbertreffen konnte, wurden es 2016 nicht wie avisiert 220 Millionen Euro, sondern 235,3 Millionen Euro. In diesem Jahr scheint die Prognose vom M\u00e4rz sogar viel zu konservativ.\n\nK\u00fcndigte Firmenchef J\u00fcrgen Albert Junker Anfang im Fr\u00fchjahr noch einen Gewinn in der Gr\u00f6ssenordnung des 2016er-Ergebnisses an - das waren 2,49 Euro je Aktie -, so beurteilt der Manager die Perspektiven nun deutlich besser. Im Juni hob der W&W-Chef Prognose an und erwartet nun f\u00fcr 2017 eine \"erkennbare Steigerung\" beim Jahres\u00fcberschuss.\n\nDie Halbjahreszahlen zeigen die neue Gewinndimension in etwa an. Bei einem Anstieg bei verdienten Beitr\u00e4gen und Finanzergebnis von 3,8 Prozent auf 3,0 Milliarden Euro machte W&W wegen einer deutlich verbesserten Schaden-/Kostenquote in der Sparte Schaden/Unfall einen Ergebnissprung. Der Gewinn in den sechs Monaten kletterte dadurch von 121,0 auf 154,9 Millionen Euro oder von 1,28 auf 1,65 Euro je Aktie.\n\nZwar investiert das SDAX-Mitglied derzeit viel in seine Digitalisierungsstrategie, doch ein Gewinn von \u00fcber 3,0 Euro je Aktie im Gesamtjahr k\u00f6nnte drin sein. Ein 6er- oder 7er-KGV ist aber weit geringer, als bei anderen Titeln des Versicherungssektors. Die bringen n\u00e4mlich in der Regel KGVs im Bereich von elf.\n\nDas hat einen Grund. Denn die schlappe Bewertung von W&W geht wohl auf das Konto vergleichsweise geringer Dividenden. W\u00e4hrend Zurich Insurance, Swiss Re, Allianz oder M\u00fcnchner R\u00fcck n\u00e4mlich oft 50 Prozent des Gewinns aussch\u00fctten und damit Dividendenrenditen im Bereich von f\u00fcnf Prozent bieten, \u00fcberweist W&W nur ein Viertel des Gewinns an die Aktion\u00e4re. Eine Rendite meist um drei Prozent ist damit weit unter Durchschnitt.\n\nM\u00f6glicherweise \u00e4ndert sich das aber bald. Schon f\u00fcr 2015 wurde die Zahlung um 20 Prozent auf 0,60 Euro je Aktie erh\u00f6ht und angesichts des starken Laufs in 2017 k\u00f6nnte es weitere Steigerungen geben. W&W notiert fast 50 Prozent unter dem Buchwert von 40,95 Euro. Wird die Dividende in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren wie in der Branche \u00fcblich auf eine Aussch\u00fcttungsquote von etwa 50 Prozent angepasst, w\u00e4ren Zahlungen um 1,50 Euro drin. Bei branchen\u00fcblicher Rendite von f\u00fcnf Prozent w\u00fcrde W&W dann bei 30 Euro notieren.

Both companies are also joining forces to develop a new predictive modeling tool for cyber-driven business interruption risks.\n\nAGCS has previously announced a similar partnership with liability modeling specialist Praedicat. While Praedicat focuses on analyzing big data to identify risk trends in liability, Cyence, based in San Mateo, California, is regarded as the leading cyber risk modeling firm. Cyence has developed a unique platform to assess both cyber exposures and a company's cyber resilience by collecting and examining data at scale from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Cyence reaches beyond the technical analysis of the IT security of a company into analyzing the human behavioral indicators and an organization's processes to calibrate cyber risk. The Cyence platform spans from risk selection and assessment of individual companies to risk accumulation and catastrophic cyber risk scenarios and their potential impact.\n\nAGCS will use the Cyence predictive risk modeling platform to quickly produce individual cyber risk profiles to improve its underwriting of each customer, as well as modeling its cyber accounts worldwide in economic terms to identify trends or growing risks or understand how they would respond to cyber incident scenarios.\n\nAGCS is integrating its underwriting expertise with Cyence's modeling know-how and technologies and creating an automated underwriting process for a new digital self-service platform for preferred distribution partners in select countries.\n\nIn a further project, AGCS and Cyence aim to pool their respective specialist know-how on business interruption and cyber risks in order to develop a new modeling tool for the emerging risk of cyber business interruption.\n\nCalifornia Uber drivers now have the option to obtain Driver Injury Protection, an insurance product, available through Aon.

A people-loving human rights activist with a background in engineering, he chairs The Egyptian Association for Scientific and Technological Development where he moderates discussion panels, giving a platform and voice to all.\n\nHe is also a writer for the Journalists Syndicate since 2000, manager of Voice of the Arabs Union of Egyptian Radio and Television since 2005, and an accomplished novelist. But that's only a list of titles. It's what he actually does with them that counts.\n\nI met him during my visit in March 2016 at the Egyptian Scientific Forum, Cairo, a conference center founded by the Minister of Education which offers forums to foster dialogue. He was there to moderate Dr Omer Salem's presentation of his new book, \"The Missing Peace.\"\n\nEl-Shamy had already moderated Dr. Salem's presentations and had had to quell a fair amount of rancor that Salem has weathered concerning his views on Arab-Jewish conciliation.\n\n\"Last night I was with the communists, tonight I am with the liberals, and tomorrow will be with the fundamentalists!\" he quipped. The Muslim Brotherhood, that is. El-Shamy holds that freedom of expression is both a Democratic and Islamic value, and vital in human rights and in the curbing of extremism.\n\n\"But what about the quandary of granting freedom of expression to those who aim to later quash the same freedom for others? It is a dilemma.\n\n\"Democracy is a process. Just like we attend primary school, and then high school, democracy is something we learn over a long, long time. Everyone must be allowed to participate and express their views, that is the best antidote to radicalism.\"\n\nEl-Shamy put his message to work when a member of the conference started an uproar about some misstated historical date. Furious over the inaccuracy, he gestured dramatically, voice raised, and el-Shamy went over and gave him a kiss! Dr. Salem likewise tried to calm him. Invited by Salem and soothed by el-Shamy, the fellow finally stormed out, impossible to placate. El-Shamy had put his value on free expression to work, even under attack.\n\nHis almost daily activism has some way to go. Egypt has been under military rule since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981, and has been in an almost continuous official state of emergency since 1967. This means that citizens may be taken into custody without charge or trial; police brutality accusations have been documented by human rights groups.\n\nFormer adviser to Anwar Sadat, Dr. Aly el-Samman commented that the assumption among those pushing for social change in the 1950's in Egypt was that democracy would be restored as soon as the old regime was replaced. No one suspected that totalitarianism would last over half a century.\n\nOnly in the year 2005 were the first multi-party presidential elections held, though accusations were leveled that the election was fraudulent. The West has had a role in totalitarianism in the Middle East, as former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice admitted, \"For sixty years the U.S. has pursued stability at the expense of democracy in the Middle East and has ended up with neither.\" Activists like El-Shamy insist that such governmental heavy-handedness is un-Islamic and provokes extremism.\n\n\"The Qur'an calls for tolerance, acceptance, free speech, and democracy\", he insists. Then he invoked the Constitution of Medina as an example.\n\n\"In the Sahifat al-Madinah, Muhammad aleiha hasalaam consulted with all the different tribes. He asked their opinions. This is democracy right there!\" Indeed, the Constitution of Medina established a pluralistic federation of Muslims and monotheistic non-Muslims in which all People of the Book had full religious freedom.\n\nHe continued, \"It is only natural that Muhammad aleiha hasalaam made such a federation, for 'there is no coercion in religion'\" quoting the Qur'an, Al-Baqara 256.\n\nEl-Shamy personally identifies as a religious man: \"I pray five times every day. The main purpose of all true religions is to make peace between people. If I am 'religious' and I do not get along with people, then I am not really religious. Some Muslims shun family members who are not part of their ideology, or who are not religious enough, and that is wrong.\"\n\nHe also insists that women must participate in public life. \"Only fifteen percent of the Egyptian Parliament consists of women. The percentage should be fifty plus one!\" And why? \"Women offer thoughtful contributions to any debate, and the men are encouraged to be more sympathetic, well mannered, and thoughtful themselves. In our family, the women are the rulers, and we are all better off because of it.\"\n\nHe shared some family stories which explain his views: \"In our family, the woman has more rights than the man. When my father died, my sister received the largest portion of the inheritance. My mother is the ruler of the family. I had a friend who wanted to marry my sister. I did not think it was a match because I did not feel that he would accept a wife as a leader. So he went behind my back! My mother joked, 'if he went to all that effort, then he loves her very much, and it is good for your sister to be the loved one. You will see that everything will work out.

But as a milestone, it isn't primarily a marker of sex equality, which remains a distant objective in the kingdom. Rather, it's an important indication that the monarchy now thinks it doesn't have to defer to the country's religious establishment.\n\nThat's a remarkable development that may allow some modernisation -- but also heralds a move away from the separation of powers and toward consolidation of absolute authority in a totalitarian king.\n\nAlthough it's little understood in the West, the Saudi dynasty was built on a foundational partnership between kingly and religious authority. On the worldly side was the royal House of Saud, going back to the 18th century founder Muhammad bin Saud. On the spiritual side was what is called the House of the Sheikh. That name refers to the Arabian sheikh par excellence: Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th century founder of Wahhabism.\n\nThe partnership's modern form was established during the career of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding monarch of the current Saudi state, who died in 1953. The basic constitutional idea is that the religious scholars, associated with the House of the Sheikh, provide the formal legal justification for the monarch's rule.\n\nIn theory, the scholars get to determine what rules are consistent with Islamic law. The monarch then carries out those rulings. His authority to govern legitimately is ultimately supposed to rest on his compliance with the Shariah as interpreted by the scholars.\n\nIn practice, like all separation of powers, however rudimentary, there is negotiation and compromise. Oil wealth has given the monarchy far more influence and therefore room for manoeuvre than it would otherwise have. Scholars can be co-opted or at least influenced through lucrative government posts.\n\nBut the religious scholars have never forgotten that their institutional power can only be preserved if they continue to say no to certain reforms sought by the monarchy. The scholars' background threat is that they might withdraw their support for the monarch. They couldn't bring down a king on their own, but they could lend their moral support to a coup. That has been all the leverage they traditionally needed.\n\nThe ban on women driving has long been a highly visible, symbolic instance of the religious scholars' exercise of a veto power over the monarchy. For least 25 years, perhaps longer, Saudi kings have been delicately exploring the possibility of allowing women to drive. But the scholars have always given a clear no.\n\nThe reason had less to do with any really compelling principle of Islamic law than with the scholars' institutional need to demonstrate their authority. Religious conservatism is the scholars' brand and the source of their power. That's why the driving announcement is so important for the distribution of power in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman is engaged in a historic experiment: the most significant attempt to consolidate the monarch's power in the last 75 years of Saudi history. That involves marginalising the rest of the royal family and focusing authority in his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Crucially, it also involves weakening the authority of the religious establishment.\n\nBy permitting driving, King Salman is telling Saudis that the clerics now have less power than they did before. And he's sending a message to the clerics themselves: Be flexible or be ignored.\n\nThis is a delicate game, to say the least. The steps King Salman and Crown Prince Muhammad have taken to centralise power leave them vulnerable to pushback from other members of the royal family who might fantasise about trying to replace the crown prince and maybe even his father. Alienating the religious establishment would give clerics the incentive to back a competing candidate.\n\nIn a sense, then, this is a test of the traditional system of clerical influence. The king and the crown prince are betting that the old system has been sufficiently weakened that it will now fail.\n\nIf that happens, the consequences will be major -- and very tricky.\n\nFrom the standpoint of many Western onlookers, the collapse or at least great weakening of the conservative religious scholars will seem like a happy result. After all, the scholars have long blocked egalitarian reforms.\n\nYet it's important to remember that, notwithstanding their conservatism, the scholars have also balanced and to a degree checked the monarchy. Unfettered power tends to become not merely authoritarian, but totalitarian. And an unchecked monarchy may in the long run have drawbacks for Saudi subjects, male or female.\n\nIt's natural to celebrate allowing women to drive. But real sex equality is still several generations away in Saudi Arabia, if that. The true development is yet another increase in royal prerogative. The experiment is under way. The outcome remains uncertain.\u2009- BLOOMBERG VIEW", "Let's hold the No campaign to the same standards it holds the Yes campaign to.\n\nWelcome to day three of The Macklemore Debacle. To get you up to speed: US rapper Macklemore is scheduled to perform four songs at the NRL Grand Final on Sunday, including his hit 'Same Love'. This has upset the No campaign, which says the NRL is making a political statement in favour of the marriage equality.\n\nMacklemore has been scheduled to sing the song for months. The decision was made long before we knew we'd be having this silly postal survey. The song went to number one in Australia in 2013, and this ridiculous controversy has sent it back to the top of the charts today. The whole thing is deeply stupid.\n\nWhen you take a step back to look at the big picture this is just the latest example of the No side trying to shut down free speech, which is ironic because their entire campaign is based on the notion that a successful Yes vote will be the death of free speech in Australia.\n\nLet's go back six months to when the idea of a postal survey was just a twinkle in a homophobe's eye. The government's plebiscite was dead in the Senate and there seemed to be no way forward for marriage equality in the current parliament. But lobbyists from Australian Marriage Equality were still trying to force the issue, and along with a bunch of business leaders like Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, they were campaigning hard for a free vote in parliament.\n\nThen up stepped Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, who said that business leaders should \"stick to their knitting\" rather than campaigning on social issues.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that people would use companies' and shareholders' money of publicly listed companies to throw their weight around,\" he said. \"If Alan Joyce and any other CEO wants to campaign on this or any other issue in their own time and on their own dime, good luck to them. Don't use an iconic brand and the might of a multibillion dollar business on issues best left to the judgement of individuals and elected decision-makers.\"\n\nWhy? Alan Joyce is answerable to his shareholders, not Peter Dutton. He and Qantas made the decision that supporting equality is good for business. If shareholders think Joyce is wrong, they can force him to change course. But given the company's recent profits, that seems unlikely.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Australian Medical Association came out in support of marriage equality, arguing it's a health issue and that the nation's peak medical body would be negligent not to support a policy that has the potential to do immeasurable good for vulnerable Australians.\n\nThe announcement was met with anger from a handful of doctors, who accused the AMA of getting too involved in politics and demanded the AMA retract its statement. An almost identical thing happened to the Law Society when it announced support for marriage equality. Nothing says \"free speech\" like demanding a retraction.\n\nFast forward to the postal survey and the No campaign made a very conscious decision not to campaign on the actual merits of marriage equality. They wanted this campaign to be about safe schools, gender identity, religious freedom, and above all else, free speech.\n\nBut then the Yes campaign sent out a bunch of text messages urging people to vote Yes. The No campaign, which has been making phone calls, knocking on doors and putting pamphlets in letterboxes, screamed that this was an invasion of privacy. How was a text message any different to those other perfectly legitimate campaign tactics? It's not. But the No campaign didn't like the message being sent and wanted to shut it down.\n\nYesterday we learned that conservative Senator Cory Bernardi is planning to make a million robo-calls urging people to vote no. With a straight face, he actually argued that what he was planning is ok while the Yes campaign's text messages were wrong. Free speech is fine when it's speech they agree with.\n\nThen we get to this week, and Macklemore unknowingly took the whole debate to new depths. The NRL, just like the AFL, Cricket Australia, the FFA, Basketball Australia and the ARU, supports marriage equality. All of these organisations decided that opening up their leagues to as broad a fan base as possible was good for business.\n\nSeparately to that, the NRL organised for a very popular artist to perform the half time entertainment at its Grand Final. The fact that one of Macklemore's songs calls for gay people to be treated with respect -- it doesn't even talk about marriage, just the idea that gay people are humans who should be treated with dignity -- was too much for the No campaign to bear.\n\nA petition calling for the NRL to keep politics out of sport was started, and Tony Abbott got behind it. \"\"Footy fans shouldn't be subjected to a politicised grand final,\" screamed the man who has co-opted Australian sporting culture at every turn throughout his career.\n\nThe No campaign got on board, calling on the NRL to censor itself. Then Dutton (yeah, him again), said he didn't want politics \"shoved down his throat\". Dutton's idea of free speech is one where two songs are played: \"one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage.''\n\nSorry, that's not how free speech works. Free speech doesn't mean everyone has to give an equal airing to every view. Free speech means letting people say the things they want to say and forcing them to live with the consequences.\n\nThe No campaign doesn't like when people truly exercise free speech because it reveals them for what they are: an ever-shrinking minority of voices screaming louder and louder as their worst fears come closer to fruition.\n\nThroughout this whole debate we've been told that it's the \"intolerant, totalitarian Yes\" campaign that represents a threat to free speech. The Yes campaign has been forced to take responsibility for the actions of every fool who headbutts Tony Abbott while wearing a \"Vote Yes\" badge -- and the campaign has done just that, time and time again.\n\nWhen faced with evidence of violence, intimidation and censorship from No supporters, the No campaign has repeatedly portrayed them as fringe-dwellers who have no links to the official campaign. \"Just ignore them,\" they say while attempting to tie every underhanded act from marriage equality supporters directly to the Yes campaign.\n\nTime and again, the No campaign has attempted to keep ideas that it doesn't like out of the public square. If we hold the No campaign to the same standard it demands of others, it's clear that it represents the true threat to free speech.", "Did you hear the one about the veteran Washington journalist who apparently hasn't bothered to read the Declaration of Independence? His name is Chuck Todd, and the only joke here is him.\n\nYou see, Chuck Todd took issue with something Alabama Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore said.\n\nApparently MSNBC's Chuck Todd has never read the Declaration of Independence, or doesn't think its ideas are true. On Wednesday night, Todd accused Alabama Republican Roy Moore of not believing in the U.S. Constitution because the senatorial candidate said our rights come from God.\n\nYes. That really happened. Watch.\n\nClip: pic.twitter.com/dJHqApFkVf\n\n-- Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) September 27, 2017\n\n\"First off, he doesn't appear to believe in the Constitution as it's written,\" Todd said, before playing a clip of Moore referencing what is written in the Declaration.\n\n\"Our rights don't come from government,\" Moore said. \"They don't come from the Bill of Rights. They come from Almighty God.\"\n\n\"Now, that's just a taste of what are very fundamentalist views that have gotten him removed from office twice as Alabama's chief justice,\" Todd said in response.\n\nNow, if the idea that rights come from God sounds familiar, it's because you've probably read the Declaration of Independence.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nWow, that's some very fundamentalist thinking there, especially since it's from the same guy who first wrote the words \"separation of church and state\" so popular with folks like Todd.\n\nWhile I have no doubt Moore will take issue with a more secular description of this concept, it doesn't change the fact that what Moore said and what many millions of American believe is that our rights stem not from the government--a concept not disputed by the Constitution, contrary to what Chuck Todd implied--but from our mere existence as human beings. These are the epitome of human rights.\n\nAfter all, should people living under totalitarian regimes enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of religion? Shouldn't people be free to assemble and petition their government over grievances?\n\nMore important, though, is whether or not the laws of the land forbidding these practices should be ample reason to pretend those rights no longer exist.\n\nTodd apparently believes that totalitarian states shouldn't be called to task for denying someone's free speech rights and that we should turn a blind eye to the reformer who is thrown in jail for political crimes.

(Leo Shi/The Epoch Times)\n\nOn March 14, 2016 at the UN's Palais des Nations in Geneva, I joined a forum to commemorate the second anniversary of the death in custody of human rights defender Cao Shunli. I couldn't help but vent my anger at what a criminal gang the Chinese Communist Party is.\n\nThe same day I received the following email: \"Teacher Teng: As ratified by the law school's Communist Party committee, the Chinese University of Political Science and Law's (CUPL's) Party branch will on March 16, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. hold a general assembly on campus in Room 211 to reach a decision on the question of Teng Biao's voluntary resignation of Party membership. You are hereby requested to attend.\"\n\nThe note was signed by \"Party Committee of the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, Legal Studies Party Branch.\"\n\nI didn't attend the meeting, but I now feel the need to give the Communist Party a piece of my mind.\n\nAlmost every child born in the so-called \"New China\" is full of boundless enthusiasm and worship for the Chinese Communist Party. As the official propaganda would have it, in all emergencies and matters of life and death, it's always Communist Party members who rush to the fore.\n\nThose who save the children on the train tracks, those who go to silence the enemy guns during combat, those who drown themselves to safeguard national assets -- even if they're not Party members, on the verge of death it will be revealed that they had written out a pledge that they had wanted to join the Party. Or if no such pledge can be produced, they'll be posthumously recognized as Communist Party members.\n\nThis brainless, crazed enthusiasm for the Communist Party isn't inculcated in a day or two. This has been a process requiring the assiduous efforts, passion, and imagination of countless authors, engineers of the soul, political commissars, historical fabulists, visual propagandists, musicians, and brainwashed parents.\n\nMembers of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are among the most peculiar creatures on earth. They are said to grasp the truth of the universe, the laws of history; they possess the ultimate ideals of mankind; and they are determined to establish heaven on earth.\n\nThey never seek to benefit themselves, but always to help others. They fear neither gods nor karmic retribution. They'll kill their own family members if \"justice\" demands it. They all think with a single mind, and every Party member is an incomparably pure and innocent saint.\n\nThe moment a bad element sneaks into the Party, they'll be expelled -- this is what guarantees the Communist Party's purity and advanced nature. Every time the Party makes a mistake, it simply turns out to be proof that the Party has an extraordinary ability at self-correction and stands as a testament to how the Party is \"great, glorious and correct.\" And this is why we know the Party so loves to make mistakes.\n\nI myself am an exemplar of the CCP's system of education (or brainwashing). From primary school to middle school to when I matriculated at Peking University, I was always the most obedient student. I never contradicted my teachers, I never cut class, I always got good grades. My ideals were Party Red, and I had a pile of certificates and awards. In other words, I was almost ruined. I had never used my own mind to think.\n\nThe process of escaping this state of brainlessness was arduous, complex, and subtle. It required an understanding of the psychology of totalitarianism, the genealogy of propaganda and brainwashing, educational anthropology, social epistemology and political aesthetics. What affected me most personally were Peking University, some professors, some student friends, some books, some underground films, and a number of incidents I went through.\n\nIn elementary school and middle school, only the \"most outstanding\" students were allowed to enter the Young Pioneers and Youth League. Those who were backwards in their thinking were left out. At university, the competition to join the Party was fierce, and I gave up on it. During graduate studies, the competition wasn't as intense, and in fact there weren't many \"lagging elements\" who hadn't joined.\n\nThe Party Branch had me write an application letter, the meaning of which I apprehended fairly quickly: first, they wanted to see you express your trust in the organization. Secondly, they thought: You're Peking University talent, so if you don't join the Party and serve the Party, have you got a problem with the Party? Who are you serving?\n\nI was half willing and half doubtful. At that point I was in the stage of my rapid awakening to the world, and I already loathed and felt estranged by the Party's organizational form, speech style, and dogma. On the other hand I'd never met anyone who joined the Party because they actually believed in it.\n\nIn two years I'd be out looking for work, so joining didn't have any disadvantages, nor did I need to take it as a big psychological burden. And at the time I also harbored a rather naive thought: intellectuals in the 1980s often said that the easiest way to bring down a fortress is from the inside, so to a degree I actually thought that I would get myself into the Party with the noble mission of opposing the Party.\n\nSo I dug up a Party application template, copied it, and was admitted to the Party. But I was firm that I would not swear the admission oath. There were 40 or 50 new Party members that were to engage in a collective oath-swearing ceremony. The leader said that the TV station would also come, and everyone would go onto the lawn to swear their oaths while it was recorded. I hated the idea and slipped away.\n\nI want to address that naive sentiment I had, that joining the Party provides the opportunity to reform the Party, or even oppose it, from the inside. But in fact, the Party's crimes are far too numerous, it has no will to change, and to this day it's still going further along down the road to perdition.\n\nI also realized that this Party's survival mechanisms are adaptive; it has its own essence, and those who don't go along with it essentially have no chance inside the Party. Anyone who can reach a high rank in the Party either comes from a top Party family, or knows how to pull strings and manipulate people, or is corrupt, or lies, or begs, or kills.\n\nSo there is not only an extremely small chance that a sincere and honest person will reach a high level in this system, but in the process, to use a Marxist term, they will be \"alienated.\" By the time they're a bureau chief or a provincial governor, their human nature will have been corroded almost entirely by the Party's nature.\n\nIf you want to be an element in the system, then everything of yours will have come from dictatorship. You will have found it impossible to not get involved in evil on the way up; you won't be able to escape having safeguarded the Party-state system. And then even if you put up with it all and become a bureau chief or a provincial governor, you still have no ability or opportunity to change the system.\n\nMy wish to quit the Communist Party arose not long after I joined it in 1997. Anyone with eyes to see would have noticed the following phenomena in society: forced demolitions, torture, black jails, corruption, miscarriages of justice, collusion between officialdom and organized crime, controlled elections, willful slaughter of innocents, forced abortions, religious persecution, literary inquisitions, violent urban enforcers (\"chengguan\"), secret police, internet censorship, tofu dreg buildings, poisoned milk, contaminated vaccines...\n\nThe more I understood about the innumerable crimes of this gang of bandits, the stronger was my determination to overthrow the government. Once, while talking and drinking with Liao Yiwu, I said that the reason I hated the Party was aesthetic rather than political.\n\nEverything the Party does is just so ugly -- from their Politburo reports to the behavior of Party officials around the banquet table; from their materialist dialectics to their hammer and sickle flag; from the tone of News Simulcast to the People's Daily editorial page; from the Spring Festival Gala to the red songs and dances in public plazas.\n\nIt's all utterly ridiculous -- reeking of blood, numbing the spirit, and acting uncouth. From the beginning I refused to join in almost all the Party's mobilization events. Though my body was in the bandits' den, my spirit had long been in rebellion.\n\nIn 2003 when I became a professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law (CUPL), I thought my opportunity had finally arrived. Peking University informed me that I needed to submit a request to transfer my Party affiliation. I refused to do so and stopped paying Party dues.\n\nI thought this would be sufficient to cut off Party ties. It never occurred to me that a year later, the Party branch at CUPL would seek me out asking for Party dues. I asked them: haven't I already left the Party organization? The woman said: How could that be? The Organization continued your membership, so come on now and pay your Party dues.\n\nI was shocked. I told her that I wouldn't pay. The young woman didn't understand what I was talking about. I explained again: \"Tell your superiors that I'm not paying Party dues. I haven't been to Party 'organization life' events in years. This is how I want to quit the Party.\" But it didn't work. They started deducting the Party dues from my salary.\n\nBeginning in 2003 I was involved in human rights law full time: there was the Sun Zhigang incident, founding the Open Constitution Initiative, the Chen Guangcheng, Gao Zhisheng, Hu Jia cases, defending Falun Gong, prosecuting child slave labor brick kiln operators, poisoned milk powder, participating in the Beijing Bar Association's elections, Charter 08, the Tibet 314 incident in 2008, the commemoration of the June 4 massacre with Beijing intellectuals in 2009, the Three Fujian Netizens case in 2010, the Jasmine Revolution in 2011, the New Citizens Movement in 2012, a speech in Hong Kong in 2014, and more.\n\nAnything that made the Party angry, I loved to get involved in. The Communist Party also kept up its end of the bargain: I was blocked in the media, had my classes suspended, put under house arrest, had my law license canceled, had my passport confiscated, was expelled from CUPL, kidnapped, disappeared, tortured, and saw my family members treated as guilty because of my actions. My trip down the road to being an anti-Party \"reactionary\" didn't happen in one or two days.\n\nThe email requesting my attendance to discuss my voluntary resignation from the Party that I received not long ago was a reminder: I'd once had an indecent relationship with that Party.\n\nThis is how I understand what an appropriate relationship with the Party and Party members is: Party members have the right to vote in direct elections for secretaries and general-secretaries at every level; they ought to know how their party dues are being spent, or if the dues have been embezzled; the goal of a party is to seize political power, but this should be conducted through competitive elections with other political parties, not through locking up the members of competing political parties -- that way of winning is too shameless.\n\nNow I wonder whether there has ever been a CCP member to have a normal relationship with this, the biggest political party on earth.\n\nThe CCP's email to me also came at a time when they had just conducted the mass arrest of lawyers on July 9, 2015.\n\nThough it wasn't in the least funny, it put me in mind of a joke: An old fellow riding the bus saw a pregnant woman standing and offered her his seat. She thanked him profusely, then asked: \"You're a Communist Party member, right?!\" The old fellow was flustered and responded: \"Who's a Party member? You're a Party member! Your whole family are Party members!\"\n\nI'm very interested in how real Communist Party members interpret this joke. This is how I understand it: The Party hasn't changed, but people's attitudes toward it have changed. They're no longer interested. The gang that has stirred up so many revolutions using the people is now facing being overthrown by the people.\n\nIn the past, people joined the Party because of their faith in communist ideology. Even though it led to ideological madness and barbarism, it still retained some form of cohesion. But now, people join the Party for power, wealth, sex, or a better job -- so even the cohesion that once held it together is no more.\n\nThe internet and market forces are increasing the Chinese public's general knowledge and understanding on a daily basis, as well as increasing the conflicts between the officials and the public. On top of that are the global processes of increased democracy and freedom. All of these are exerting centrifugal force on the CCP.\n\nThis essay serves as my own, official lifting of the Party's spell, and my complete renunciation of the Communist Party organization. I was once a member of this evil gang, and I once proactively, and later passively, paid party dues to support them doing evil. These are stains I carry, and which I will make up for from now into the future.\n\nOf course, I am putting the matter in the starkest terms -- for years now already I've done a great many things to oppose the Party. When the Hong Kong journalist Jiang Xun was accused of being a Communist Party member, Jiang sued and was awarded 850,000 yuan (US$128,000) in compensation.\n\nIf anyone calls me a Communist Party member now, even though I won't sue them, I will make a sharp retort: \"You are the Communist Party member -- and your whole family are Communist Party members!\"\n\nTranslated by Matthew Robertson.", "British prog/pop/prog-pop band Yes -- who play the Kimmel Center on Sunday -- had been active since 1968 and inactive for a year before re-jiggering and scoring number one hit in 1983 with \"Owner of a Lonely Heart.\" It's the catchiest, most popular song in the Yes catalogue, but it's still pretty weird.

And if you're wondering why, the answer is also Yes.\n\n[1:30] The bass player sits down in the back seat of an empty car can turns into a snake.\n\n[1:45] The guitscarfist is a lizard now.\n\n[1:50] The drummer, decked out in jaunty attire, is walking on some bathroom sinks. Wait, he's a kitty cat!\n\n[2:14] After one full minute of ambient/animal noises, the music begins anew. That riff, you guys.\n\n[2:20] Meet the new star of the video, a headache-ravaged, Patrick Bateman-looking everyman. He's on his way to the business office where he is employed as a worker. Without warning, he is accosted by toughs in trench coats and strong-armed into a government building. The man is an enemy of the Yes police state -- a sleepy, Dark City-style dystopia where reality is routinely fucked with by the most devious supernatural pranksters in prog-pop.\n\n[3:01] As the man is being led past lines and cubicles, he begins suffering from a serious of migraineous visions in which the Yes animals invade his personal space. It starts with the bassist-snake suddenly appearing around his neck while he showers.\n\n[3:40] The guy lets a scorpion walk on his face. In my experience, this is what people with pet scorpions do. They're like \"What, is this creepy? I'm just hanging out with my pet scorpion, being normal.\" Ugh. Gross people with gross pets. Kissing their parakeets.\n\n[3:41] The drummer, in kitty cat form, is dropped onto the man's back. He really freaks out about that, but dude: It's the least weird thing that's happened to you all day.\n\n[3:52] The man washes his face with centipedes and we think about the journey we're on. There are still two and a half minutes to go.\n\n[4:00] The man is brought before some sort of Kafka-esque council and he just straight up embarrasses himself up there. Guilty of being a spaz!\n\n[4:23] The lead singer of Yes is a bird eating raw meat on the back of a sleeping man.\n\n[4:29] Kitty cat again.\n\n[4:40] A slow elevator has taken the man to hell. No wait, it's just the ground floor garage. People are using power tools.\n\nThe man is attacked by a metalsmith. This is what happens in a totalitarian regime: The government keeps the people fighting each other.\n\n[5:15] The man kills the metalsmith and escapes by ladder to the roof where he is quickly surrounded by the fearsome Yes demi-gods, his tormentors. They did this. They haunted him with visions. They turned him into a murderer.\n\n[6:00] Using their mind control powers, they twirl the man around for awhile then send him leaping off the side of the building. They have no expression, but we know this amuses Yes.\n\n[6:02] As he falls, the man becomes unnaturally flexible like a ragdoll. It's almost hard to believe that's a person.\n\n[6:20] The man is back on the bridge. The last few minutes of the video were a vision, a nightmare. He... he killed someone. Is doesn't matter whether it was real or not. You're every move you make.\n\nThe man turns around. He won't be going to work today. He will be marching straight to Buckingham Palace to tell the queen everything he knows about Yes. He hopes she's not in on it. He hopes she doesn't open the door and turn into an evil turtle or something.\n\nWill he make it? Doubtful. The last thing we hear is the horrible flapping of the singer-bird's wings.", "High school and university students hold mass rally in Barcelona to Catalonia's right to vote.\n\nThousands of striking high school and university students have marched in Barcelona in support of Catalonia's independence referendum which the Spanish central government in Madrid has vowed to stop.\n\n\"We will vote!\" and \"Independence!\" the protesters shouted as they marched along the Gran Via, one of Barcelona's main avenues, on Thursday.

It is an environment that she recognised very well.\"\n\nMr Verhofstadt suggested Brexit was a form of \"dictatorship of the majority\", saying the views of the 48 per cent of Britons who voted for the UK to remain in the EU must be taken into account.\n\nHe said: \"48 per cent is not a minority you can ignore, because doing politics is about trying to take all big opinions on board and to find compromises, not to poke up differences.\n\n\"John Stuart Mill teaches us that democracy is not a dictatorship of the majority and certainly not on fundamental issues, on issues of vital interest, national interest - and I think membership of the European Union is a vital national issue and interest.\n\nViews of every group of citizens on Brexit should be taken into account, he added.\n\nBrexit: the deciders 8 show all Brexit: the deciders 1/8\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier speaks to the media as he arrives at the Council of the European Union ahead of an EU Council meeting on April 29, 2017 in Brussels, Belgium.

I think it's a reductionist view on identity.\n\n\"It's perfectly possible to be a Londoner, English, British and European at the same time - there is no contradiction and it has nothing to do with split allegiance.\n\n\"My message is: watch out, beware of politicians who want to define your identity. The only reason they do so is to categorise people, to reduce you to your nationality, your ethnicity, your religion. 'Split allegiance' are two words that belong to the language of states that are totalitarian, and not to democracies like Britain.\"\n\nThe Belgian MEP also said a Brexit deal would need to be agreed within the next year if it is to be finalised before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nSaying he believed a deal would ultimately be reached, Mr Verhofstadt added: \"There has to be an agreement in October or November [2018] because then this agreement will go to the European Parliament and we need four or five months [to ratify it].\"\n\nMore about: Guy Verhofstadt Brexit Theresa May Florence Boris Johnson LSE Reuse content", "BY STEVE ERICKSON | Karl Marx City\u00e2\u0080\u009d opens with home movies, presumably from co-director Petra Epperlein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood in East Germany.

Patriots love their country because it does good things; for nationalists it's our country right or wrong. A lot of stuff nationalists call patriotic couldn't possibly be more un-American.\n\nThe singing of the national anthem before sporting events, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, are prime examples.\n\nThe latest nationalism vs. patriotism controversy arrives courtesy of Colin Kaepernick, the African-American pro football player blackballed by the NFL for kneeling in silent protest over police shootings of blacks rather than stand for the signing of the national anthem alongside his teammates and fans before games. The \"take a knee\" movement has spread throughout the league, largely in response to President Trump's crude remark that those who refuse to stand during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" are \"sons of bitches.\"\n\nAt football games and similar events where the anthem is sung, standers far outnumber kneelers -- and that's weird. Because if one person is kneeling against police brutality, then it stands to reason that standing up means you support cops gunning down unarmed black people. Are there really that many racists?\n\nThat, and when you stop to think about it, the whole idea of rote rituals to prove our loyalty run completely counter to what most Americans, liberal or conservative, think their country is about.\n\nAs I have written before, lefties and righties don't have the same ambitions for the U.S. Following the tradition of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Left idealizes individual rights. They dream of a country where everyone is not only created equal, but treated accordingly. The Right values empire. Rightists' ideal America is a global military and economic superpower.\n\nStill, the two sides have something in common. They want to be left alone, to live their lives as free of government interference as possible. Progressives want the government out of their bedrooms. Traditionalists want it out of their incomes. Totalitarianism -- a form of government whose control over citizens' daily lives leads to the requirement that everyone attend one meeting after another and report dissent to the authorities -- could no more catch on here than North Korean-style displays of signs flipped by synchronized flags or parades of military hardware (though Trump wants to start those).\n\nLike the singing of the anthem at games, the Pledge of Allegiance reflects a totalitarian impulse you find in fascist and authoritarian regimes, not democracies. The U.S. and Canada are the only countries on earth where national anthems are played at the start of sporting events. Even in many authoritarian states, the requirement that children (and athletes) swear fealty to the nation (or, as here, its flag) would be considered too creepy to contemplate.\n\nWhen your country is crazier than Zimbabwe, it's time to take stock -- even if you're a Republican.\n\nOther nations require oaths of allegiance from those taking public office, like members of parliament. Some ask the same of foreigners seeking to become naturalized citizens. But the U.S. may be the only nation on earth to have a widely-used pledge of allegiance.\n\nChildren who refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance are routinely punished, criticized and ostracized, even in public schools. I know -- it happened to me in elementary school. Kaepernick, a top-tier athlete, has been denied employment. These are obvious violations of the all-American value of free speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nThe addition of \"under God\" in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy era and its rancid loyalty oaths, further violates another core principle of Americanism, the freedom to worship as you please or not at all as protected under the Establishment Clause of the US. Constitution.\n\nIn one respect, however, the Pledge of Allegiance owes its origins to something that couldn't be more American: a huckster out to make a few extra bucks.\n\nWhy do Americans pledge allegiance to the \"flag,\" as opposed to the nation or its government? It boils down to capitalist greed. The origins of the Pledge date to 1892, when James B. Upham, the marketing executive of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion used the 400th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas to promote a conference in honor of the American flag. He pushed the Pledge in his magazine as a way to promote nationalism and sell flags to public schools. Schoolhouses purchased 26,000 flags the first year alone.", "Why should obsession with \"cultural Marxism\" mean one should fear protesting police crimes?\n\nRon Paul appeared on Alex Jones's InfoWars to weigh in on the controversy that has the nation pointlessly aggrieved: some football players aren't happy with how often police kill black men and choose to express this by kneeling rather than standing when the national anthem is played before football games.\n\nPaul, the former Republican congressman (and two-time Republican, and one-time Libertarian, presidential candidate) seemed to see other things worth being angry about in the kneeling NFLers behavior and in the team owners' tolerating it, for various unconvincing and poorly expressed reasons.\n\nRon Paul's Revolution\n\nPresident Donald Trump has chosen to cynically and idiotically fan the flames of this phony controversy, dividing the nation roughly between those who either agree that cops violently misbehave too often or that Americans should be able to peacefully and symbolically express that opinion during the national anthem at a football game, and those who think public and presidential pressure should force everyone to \"show respect for the flag\" in one proscribed ritual way.\n\nMatt Welch masterfully parsed out nearly all the issues relevant to the libertarian perspective about this dumb controversy at Reason earlier this week. Among his conclusions were that it would be great to get government money and giveaways and crony treatment out of sports, and that it's a healthy thing for free Americans to react to presidential dudgeon by doing the opposite of what (he claims) he wanted. (Trump, the political imp of the perverse, likely would have been disappointed if everyone had obeyed his command to rise for the anthem.)\n\nOn his show, Alex Jones, a popularizer of the idea that the U.S. government conducts baroque and sinister conspiracies with maddening regularity and for tyrannical ends, now seems more worried that \"white people\" and America are being criticized. Paul, fortunately given the shadow of racist comments that appeared under his name (but were not, he insists, written by him) decades ago in newsletters he issued, doesn't directly rise to that bait, moving forward as if it wasn't even said.\n\nBut Paul apparently, for reasons he never specifies or makes clear in this interview, finds the display of kneeling by football players to be a distasteful example of a modern right-populist bogeyman, \"cultural Marxism,\" a (often seen as conspiratorial) movement to overturn all traditional western values in order to soften our underbelly to accept totalitarian communism, through means unspecified.\n\nThe Ron Paul who created a stir for a message of small government, sound money, and liberty in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns nearly entirely avoided this kind of cranky right-wing talk. I never heard him claim the free choices of any American to express an anti-government opinion in any context was something to be upset about in any way. (I witnessed dozens of hours of his political speeches while researching my 2012 book Ron Paul's Revolution: The Man and the Movement He Inspired.)\n\nBeing a politician seemed to bring out the best in him, a real rarity. When seeking a national audience as a presidential candidate, the need to appeal outside his pre-existing constituency containing many whose anti-statism had a right-populist streak gave him room to paint a wide and sympathetic vision of liberty, one with no place for griping about \"cultural Marxism\" or that some people are freely choosing to not embrace those old-time western family values.\n\nThat Ron Paul left right-wing culture war nonsense entirely behind, speaking instead of the human tragedies of military empire, the dangers of federal management of the money supply, the stupidity and evil of restricting our free choices that don't directly harm others, from drug use to raw milk consumption. That Ron Paul celebrated the powers of a free people and free culture to unify us and make us the best we could be, as individuals and as a nation.\n\nHis message of peace, prosperity, and a government that no longer went out of its way to help the powerful and harm the powerless seemed designed to appeal to progressive radicals as much as to staunch libertarians or the small-government right, even explaining how programs of direct help to the destitute should not be where limiting government's reach and spending should start.\n\nIn the Jones interview this week, Paul hits the correct note that President Trump should leave the NFL knee controversy alone, saying \"the president ought to be a lot less noisy about it\" and should not be \"threatening people [like] they are committing some crime.\"\n\nHe also rightly said, \"a lot of this got worse once football teams started talking money from government to promote supernationalism and militarism\" and that \"the American people should not allow government to give one cent to football and allow them to promote militarism.\"\n\nPaul has built his entire political and polemical career identifying the moral crimes of the U.S. government in areas both foreign and domestic. Why should he consider it some negative \"attack on tradition and culture\" via \"cultural Marxism\" for football players to quietly refuse to show demanded obeisance to the American flag, or the American government?\n\nHe gave no hint of an explanation, and there is no decent one from a libertarian perspective I can imagine.\n\nPaul stresses to Jones some points that are technically true, but not terribly relevant from a wide-range libertarian perspective. Pressure or restrictions on free speech not directly from government do not implicate the First Amendment, as Paul says here. True.\n\nYet the ability to express oneself freely is a good thing, a core part of liberty. That's why libertarians don't want government to restrict it. Those concerned with human liberty should value a culture of free expression and defend it against pressures both state and non-state, even though one does not necessarily have an absolute right to express oneself on or with someone else's property.\n\nBut to speak with Jones as Paul does in this interview of the relationship of NFL team owners and players as one of \"property\" rather than of contract and thus with no implications for a concern for liberty to express one's objections to government misconstrues the issue. Merely being an employee of a company does not give the company a \"property right\" to exercise; the employee-employer relationship is a mutual contractual one, implicit or explicit.\n\nWhile the NFL could, if it wished, make employment contingent on standing for the anthem, they've chosen not to. Paul has provided no argument, and I cannot imagine one within his larger vision of the proper role of government and what makes for a prosperous and free society, as to why the players failure to stand or the owners' failure to try to make employment as a player contingent on standing is something a libertarian should care about at all, certainly not be \"disgusted\" about, except possibly to cheer.\n\nPaul encourages a \"boycott\" to solve this nonsensical, nonexistent \"problem,\" which creates tensions for those who believe that free markets bind all of us across nations, classes, and creeds into a complicated but delicate system of wealth-creation and betterment for all.\n\nBoycott is indeed anyone's right within a free market. But encouraging everyone to refuse to do business with those whom we differ ideologically or politically is a losing game for everyone, especially anyone with a radical point of view, left, right, or libertarian. Markets make us partners to mutual advantage; boycotts make us enemies. This does not mean it isn't within anyone's rights to do it. No one has a right to our business or our approval. But willfully trying to limit the wealth-generating benefits of markets to those with whom one agrees risks impoverishing us all, as those dedicated to the old-fashioned western values of cosmopolitan free trade across lines of religion, nation, and class should respect.\n\nThus, advocating a culture of boycott requires more heavy thought from a market advocate than Paul gives it here, especially given that he hasn't rationally established any good reason why the NFL deserves punishment.\n\nThe \"Cultural Marxism\" he seems to be angered about was of zero concern to candidate Paul. Even current freelance popularizer Paul doesn't seem to give it very much attention if Google is any guide.\n\nAn October 2016 episode of Paul's \"Liberty Report\" show, though, was dedicated to a rather rambling and disconnected set of comments on the matter. Paul sees an ill-defined attempt to \"undermine the Judeo-Christian moral values of family\" as key to imposing authoritarianism on America. He worries harsh social pressure is being aimed at, say, stores selling blue clothes to boys and pink clothes to girls; that campus officials are afraid to speak out against leftist agitation on campus; and that the notion of individual rights is being swamped by a mentality of special group rights. Paul rambles over a lot of other \"cultural right-wing\" concerns candidate Paul wisely left alone.\n\nBut he ends that October show with a message that the Ron Paul who was Alex Jones' guest this week should have remembered: \"nobody can initiate aggression against another person\" -- the very message NFL's kneelers are trying to convey about American police. As Paul said in his episode on \"cultural Marxism,\" in \"a free society\" one \"is allowed to criticize government\" and \"too many people don't want that, they want people to toe the line.\n\n\"Liberty means allowing [everybody] to make personal choices, social relations, sexual choices, personal economic choices\" Paul went on to say, and it should not be a \"threat,\" it should \"bring people together.\"\n\n\"Peace and prosperity,\" Paul said in that October show,\" is what he is \"waiting for and working for.\" He closed with a quote from H.L. Mencken, along the lines of \"the most dangerous man to any government\" is the man who \"without regard to prevailing superstitions and taboos\" comes to the conclusion \"the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable.\"\n\nOne might almost imagine that someone contemplating incidents of police violent abuse and murder of American citizens might come to Mencken's conclusion, and thus have a very good reason for not wanting to stand for the national anthem.", "Artiste, muse, temptress, seductress, Cabaret heroine Sally Bowles (Charissa Hogeland, Kinky Boots national tour) made a magnificent entrance Wednesday night at the Arden, appearing on a balcony above a bevy of scantily-clad chorus babes who danced and writhed, stretched and pranced on the stage below.\n\nWelcome to Cabaret, the opening show in the Arden Theatre Company's 30th anniversary season.\n\nAn immensely enjoyable musical with terrific music and great choreography by Jenn Rose, director Matthew Decker's staging has brilliant ensemble performances but features puzzlingly understated -- even lackluster -- turns by its three leads.\n\nIt's 1931 Berlin and we're in the Kit Kat Klub, one of the sleazy bohemian joints that sprang up in Weimar Germany, a strange, liberated period in Germany's history sandwiched by the horrors of the two World Wars.\n\n\"Willkommen! Bienvenue! Welcome!\" sings the queerly-attired Emcee (John Jarboe, director and librettist of Opera Philadelphia's ANDY: A Popera, making his Arden debut).\n\nHalf in drag, his face covered in white grease makeup that evokes something between Kabuki theater and a crazy Halloween mask, the Emcee had made his entrance a few minutes earlier to warm up the audience, some of whom were seated at round little cabaret tables around the stage, whose runway thrust toward the rest of the audience.\n\nDecker, co-founder of Theatre Horizon, has recent credits that include a series of children's shows at the Arden. Here he delivers an awfully loosey-goosey, laid-back version of the musical that tries to evoke the experience of an actual cabaret while maintaining the show's satirical edge.\n\nThe mix isn't always successful, and the production's dizzy mirth often obscures its dark, apocalyptic underside and the coiled, razor-edged, metallic tension that carries the story forward to its ineluctable conclusion with the ugly triumph of the Nazi ethos.\n\nCabaret is above all a war story - it's about the war of liberal democracy versus totalitarianism, the war of the sexes, and the war of bohemianism versus bourgeois respectability. Much of that is lost here, despite Jarboe's attempts to use the musical's themes to critique the Trump administration.\n\nJarboe plays the Emcee for laughs and amps up the more cuddly aspects of his camp character. It's a far cry from the famously acidic performance delivered by Joel Grey, who originated the part on Broadway and played the character in Bob Fosse's acclaimed 1972 film adaptation. For her part, Hogeland is far too understated as Sally, with a performance too subtle for a show that's supposed to be over-the-top. The story is told through the eyes of Sally's love interest, a well-fed American middle class boy named Cliff (Daniel Fredrick, The Importance of Being Earnest at Walnut Street Theatre), a would-be author who moves to Berlin for inspiration. This role recedes in the shadows, lost in the hustle.\n\nCabaret is one of those shows that's as famous for its distinguished pedigree and history as its aesthetic merits. It was created by composer John Kander, lyricist Fred Ebb, and Philadelphia-born playwright Joe Masteroff, who adapted it from John Van Druten's 1951 play I Am a Camera -- itself an adaptation of Goodbye to Berlin, a 1939 semi-autobiographical novella by British-American author Christopher Isherwood.\n\nWhen it premiered in 1966, Cabaret was a provocative assault on gender norms, artistic norms, and moral norms, a work of art suffused with '60s values. It has has been revived about once a decade since, including three Broadway productions in 1993, 1998, and 2014, all directed by Sam Mendes and all featuring Alan Cumming as the Emcee with the role of Sally played by Jane Horrocks, Natasha Richardson, and Michelle Williams respectively, while Liza Minnelli was hands-down brilliant in the 1972 film version.\n\nThe Arden pays homage to this tradition, while not quite giving the show the oomph it deserves.\n\nCabaret.

Wright suggests that Darkest Hour, which stars Gary Oldman as the British prime minister during arguably the UK's most testing period of the second world war, is directly relevant to the US's current political turmoil.\n\n\"There's a big question in America at the moment: what does good leadership look like,\" says Wright, speaking to coincide with the launch of the latest trailer for the film. \"Churchill resisted when it mattered most, and as I travel around America I am really impressed and optimistic at the level of resistance happening in the US at the moment. After George W Bush was elected, it wasn't the same level; there was more apathy then. Now people are very vocal and that's really positive.\"\n\n\"Churchill made terrible mistakes as well as achieving great triumphs, but central to it all was a sense of doubt, and doubt is an important and vital factor of leadership, and democracy itself.\"\n\nThe significance of Churchill to the Trump White House was underlined soon after Trump took office, when the president was pictured with a bust of Churchill in the Oval Office, having made great play of reinstating it after succeeding Barack Obama. However, Wright says when he began working on the film in January 2016 - pre-Brexit, and pre-Trump - its future political relevance was entirely unguessed at. \"There was no sense of it being part of a zeitgeist at all. But as we made the film events came over us like a great wave, and suddenly the film became strangely topical. In the past I had always wanted to make a topical film, so I think its a case of be careful what you wish for.\"\n\nWright, whose previous credits include Pride & Prejudice, the Jane Austen adaptation starring Keira Knightley, and the Ian McEwan adaptation Atonement, which was partly set in the same wartime period as Darkest Hour, is sanguine about attempts of political hijack of his film, as fellow British director Christopher Nolan had to endure after the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage endorsed Dunkirk on Twitter.\n\n\"I don't think anything like that will happen when anyone sees the film to be honest. Churchill may have been co-opted or re-appropriated by certain factions in the rightwing spectrum, but I'm not sure that's true to who he was and what he believed. There are a lot of his policies I vehemently disagree with, not least his position on women's suffrage and, later, Indian independence, but there was a moment when he was right, and he resisted. The level of resistance he put up against bigotry and hate and totalitarianism is vital.\"\n\nWright points out that Churchill's long political career also encompassed liberal breakthroughs, including passing the National Insurance act in 1911 while president of the board of trade, which set up the first social security payments and created the foundations for the welfare state, and a string of speeches after the war that threw his weight behind a European union. \"Those things get forgotten, says Wright. \"I tried to be balanced: neither hero-worship him, nor throw him to the gutter.\"\n\n\"He kicked and he screamed and got a lot of things wrong in his career, and in his personal life, but one thing he got right was he resisted the tide of fascism, bigotry and hate. And that seems to speaking to America now, and Britain too.\"", "When Australian Ballet director David McAllister was growing up in suburban Perth, there weren't a whole heap of boys learning classical dance. \"My poor father lived through the whole drama of having this crazy boy who wanted to be a ballet dancer,\" he says. \"He was very supportive when I look back on it but he used to pick me up from ballet every week and go 'you know you don't have to go back next week if you don't want to...' and I'd go 'no Dad, it's really great, I really want to go'.\"\n\nThis was the early 1970s. Elsewhere in the world Rudolf Nureyev was redefining the image of the male ballet dancer, but Australia was late to the party. Mr McAllister senior's trepidation was more a symptom of the lingering cultural resistance to men in tights. \"He was very wonderful in the way that he didn't want to stop me but I think he probably would have liked it if I had stopped. Not now, he's very proud.\"\n\nToday's Australia sees innumerable boys signing up for ballet school, says McAllister, \"because I think parents of today are much less worried about gender stereotypes. Girls playing with trucks and boys doing ballet is not something that gets frowned upon.\" Aside from the occasional embarrassing spectacle of \"footballers doing the four swans from Swan Lake in really bad tutus\", anyone who's ever seen an Australian Ballet dancer in action will instantly recognise the elite level of physical discipline their art requires. The other day a group of Collingwood players were at the AB working with one of the company's strength coaches, and watching a class left them \"taken aback at the physicality that the guys need to do what they do\", says McAllister.\n\nBut while men in ballet are now as accomplished as their female counterparts, it wasn't always that way. \"When I joined the company if you had two legs you pretty much got a job,\" says McAllister. \"When I first started dancing, the public thought of male dancers as wearing powdered wigs and being a bit limp. That they were very much standing behind the woman and often a bit pink.\"\n\nUntil the 20th century, the men in ballet were less like celebrities and more like something you'd hire from Bunnings - mechanical functionaries to help women fly higher, extending their lines and lengthening their leaps.\n\nAustralian Ballet principal Kevin Jackson says that for much of the artform's history, the job of a man was \"mainly about supporting the women. Basically all of the big classical ballets are based on the female being the lead role and the Prince is sort of just there to kiss her or save the day. He's not the main plotline of the story, so to be in full focus in ballets like Spartacus is really cool.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's speaking of the Australian Ballet's new production of Spartacus, premiering in 2018. It's a welcome work not merely as a new ballet in its own right, but as one that addresses the shortfall in really meaty roles for ballet blokes. The roles ballerinas dream of a shot at are countless: Giselle, Odille, Aurora. You can almost list the great parts for men on one foot. There's Swan Lake's Siegfried, Giselle's Albrecht, what's-his-name in Manon. For most of ballet's history, the (sugar) plum jobs have been women's. Men have been cast as support. Literally.\n\n\"It's a great drawcard for our very staunch female audience to see the men up the front wearing very little and looking fantastic,\" says McAllister, \"but I think it's also as positive an experience for the male members of the audience that they can see something that's much more physical and athletic and based in that struggle for the men.\"\n\nMcAllister traces the great revolution in male ballet back to Nureyev's defection from Russia to the West in 1961. \"There was a whole generation of male dancers that basically just walked out of the theatre because he changed the perception of what male dancing was,\" says McAllister. \"Instead of wearing heeled shoes and powdered wigs they were meant to be strong, powerful, charismatic, dynamic, sexy, all these things that drew a whole new audience to ballet.\"\n\nNureyev and fellow Soviet defector Mikhail Baryshnikov made the male dancer less of a function and more of a feature. With them came new ideals of what masculinity on stage could be: \"the females have always had that aesthetic of the ballerina, frail, fragile but with steely strength, whereas now the men are much more muscular, they have to dance as effortlessly as the women but still doing the big, huge aerial jumps and turns and the big dynamic partnering,\" says McAllister.\n\nIn the last few decades, says Jackson, the requirements for men in ballet \"have exceeded anyone's expectations. We're expected not only to jump, do massive tricks, do multiple turns, but then be a good partner, strong, be able to act and support the females.\"\n\nThe men of the Australian Ballet must be Olympic-level athletes today, and the expectations placed on them extend beyond the physical. \"We have to be very strong-willed and have a lot of determination and inner strength to get through the workload that is expected of us,\" says Jackson. \"And there's also an expectation for you to become a leader of the company. As principal men or senior dancers of the company we have to lead the way and teach the younger dancers how to be.\"\n\nChoreographer Lucas Jervies agrees that the ballet man is more than just a top-tier athlete, but has to cultivate \"consideration of your partner, how you share the stage with that person. It's about responding to your colleagues, about being generous with your port de bras, that's the movement of the arms. It's about taking flight, jumping with ease, being humble, being self-assured. It's all of those things. I don't think it's about brute strength.\"\n\nJervies is the choreographer of next year's Spartacus for the Australian Ballet. The company already has a Spartacus in its repertoire, but it hasn't been performed by the company since 2002. It was the last show Jervies performed in before leaving the company as a dancer, and Jackson was still a student when he appeared in it as an extra. \"Some ballets are very much of a period and then you bring them back and they start showing their age a little,\" says McAllister.\n\nJust as the broader social notions of masculinity continue to shift, Jervies is firm in his desire to make a new Spartacus that reflects our age. \"It's not an opportunity to revisit old-fashioned masculinity.\"\n\nThe story is still that of the Thracian king enslaved by the Romans who stirs up a revolt among his fellow captives, but Jervies has scoured the literature to create a figure who is more than an action-hero fantasy. Some of the writings he has found describe Spartacus \"almost as a Buddha or a Jesus-type figure where the other slaves call him 'father' and they look to him for advice and comfort. In some of the Roman historians' writings they talk about him in a similar way, that he was educated and smart. He was strategic and patient. I'd really like to tap into those qualities if I can.\"\n\nFor both Jervies and Jackson, the roles such as Spartacus are less interesting for the feats of physical virtuosity they afford male dancers than they are for the increased depth of emotion and character. Jackson played the title role in last year's Nijinsky: \"The biggest thing about Nijinsky was that it was about a real person. Someone that you could connect with through dance.\" Spanning the years from the iconic male dancer's heights of international fame to the mental breakdown he suffered after his career ended, the production gave Jackson the opportunity to explore mental illness through ballet. It's a long way from fairytale princes.\n\nJervies is looking to accomplish something similarly relevant with his Spartacus. He's still setting it in Rome, but \"it's really important for me to research and understand the current climate. Modern day slavery and what that actually means. To look at slavery in regimes over the last hundred years, even further back to the American and South American slave trade.\"\n\nJervies was recently in a cafe listening to the score to Aram Khachaturian's Spartacus ballet of 1954. The venue was quiet enough that its rousing percussion, brassy flourish and heavy bass notes could be heard by the barista, who leaned out and yelled \"is that Star Wars?\"\n\nJervies will be using Khachaturian's score for his production, but is as attentive to the work's politics as its theatrical bombast. \"Khachaturian was denounced by the Communist Party in 1947 for creating music that was too difficult for the masses. He was exiled and nearly killed. I guess you can see writing Spartacus as somewhat of a political act. I think Rome is Stalin's Russia, it's Hitler's Germany, it's a totalitarian state where the individual is a subject of state control. Where stepping out of line gets you killed. Just talking about that makes me think of North Korea, of Mauritania in North Africa, of China to some extent. I'm finding different representations of those situations and societies and trying to find a way to distil those and inject them into our production in a supportive way.\"\n\nIt's hard to reconcile themes of modern slavery and oppressive regimes with ballet's dictum to make things beautiful. \"Ballet's inherently beautiful,\" Jervies concedes. \"You can't ignore that. Spartacus is about breaking free and standing up against the state but it's also about love.\" He cites Auschwitz survivor Victor Frankl's thoughts on suffering as offering a way of bringing together the darker themes he's exploring with ballet's romanticism: \"he talks about love being everything. Without love he could not have gotten through (the Holocaust). It was dreaming of love and the fact of being in love that saved his soul. So in my production when Spartacus meets Flavia, the love interest, it's a catalyst for him to change, to be a better man, to not put up with the status quo. It's for that reason that he breaks free, and that quest for love is really the driving force for the whole production. That creates a great space to put both beauty and terror side by side.\"\n\nWhile Spartacus illustrates how far male dancers have come from the days of those powdered wigs and heeled shoes, it's not as if men have been absent from ballet's history - quite the opposite. \"Men created ballet on women,\" says Jervies, \"when gender roles were very specific, shall we say. Oppressive. There are still traces of that left behind in the art form. There's still work to be done.\"\n\nBut for all of the legacy left by Nureyev, Nijinsky and Baryshnikov, Jervies says that the real advances that benefit male dancers in today's ballet were made by women. \"What I think is really cool is that women actually created modern dance. It's the bravery and the wisdom of these female pioneers that has returned or seeped back into ballet and educated and expanded and kind of crafted the roles of both sexes in ballet today.\"\n\nSpartacus is part of the Australian Ballet's 2018 program. australianballet.com.au", "By Jerry Newcombe\n\nI'm not proud to be an American - I'm grateful. I didn't do anything to become a citizen of this country. I was just born. But in appreciating America today, I feel like I'm a freak or something.\n\nSo many Americans hate America. Why? There's so much to love. Some would-be immigrants risk their lives to get here, so that they might have a chance to enjoy the freedom we take for granted every single day.\n\nThe hatred against America is often fostered by our schools and our media. It's cool to bash America. You can see it in the now-regular pushback against the National Anthem and the flag in some of the football games.\n\nBut here are ten reasons I am thankful to live here:\n\n1) America is more of an idea than a nationality, and it's a good idea. We are a proverbial melting pot of all sorts of nationalities.\n\nDr. Richard Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary, once told me in a television interview, \"We're the only nation in the world that is a creedal nation. Every other nation in the world is tied to ethnicity. We're not; we're tied to ideas.\"\n\n2) We are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.\n\nLand went on to say that the ideas that animate this country \"are embodied in the Declaration of Independence... that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\"\n\nLand continues, \"So anybody can become an American in a way that you can't become a Frenchman or become a German....That makes us unique in the world; and that creed was formed and shaped by the Puritans, by those who came here seeking religious freedom. As Martin Marty once said, 'we are a nation with the soul of a church.'\"\n\n3) Even when America doesn't live up to its creed - that all men are created equal - we can correct those mistakes.\n\nKnowing that man is sinful, the founding fathers built in mechanisms to correct our errors. Slavery was a terrible evil that our nation was able to constitutionally correct, after its most brutal and bloody war.\n\n4) In America, we are all free to worship according to the dictates of our conscience (or to not worship at all). Religious freedom, though at risk in our day, is part of the very foundation of the nation.\n\nLand also said, \"If you want to understand America, you have to go back to Massachusetts Bay, and you have to go back to Governor Winthrop; and we came here to be a shining city on a hill, the New Jerusalem, to light the way for the old world.\"\n\n5) Although religious freedom is at risk today in America, it still exists for the most part.\n\nAs Rev. Winthrop once said in a letter to his wife, after listing one challenge after another, \"We here enjoy God and Jesus Christ, and is not this enough?\" Though tattered and torn, the First Amendment is still in place.\n\n6) Generally, if we do what is right, we have no fear of things like a knock at the night of secret police, looking to take us away. That is common under totalitarian regimes.\n\nFor example, this happened to the Christian family of Harry Mihet, an attorney for Christ today in America, who grew up in Communist Romania. One night his family almost got in trouble for having Bibles for distribution, but they managed to outwit the secret police. In this speech he explains how.\n\n7) We have the right to provide a quality education for our children.\n\nIn many cases, we have to work harder to provide an alternative to the politically correct indoctrination of the government schools. But those alternatives exist. For example, in America, we can legally home school our children - in all 50 states.\n\n8) We can make of our lives what we wish. We have the freedom to pursue our God-given dreams. Often we can find the means to fulfill them\n\n9) We have the freedom to choose the elected officials we wish to represent us in this republic. If we don't like the current crop, we can vote in new ones. I see some people protesting Trump, holding signs saying, \"He's not my president.\" Ironically, some of those protesters did not even vote.\n\n10) We have the freedom to disagree with our government and voice our disagreement. We have the freedom work and pray for positive change.\n\nAmerica is far from perfect. That's why the prayer in the hymn \"America the Beautiful\" is so appropriate: \"America, America, God, mend thine every flaw.\" Praying for that and working together for the common good is far better than America-loathing and working to destroy the nation from within.\n\n\u00a9 Jerry Newcombe", "The two States are involved in an increasingly aggressive war of words with the terrifying threat of nuclear weapons thrown into the mix.\n\nMany are worried about the testing of missiles and bombs - and the angry rhetoric, when a miscalculation could lead to war. Tonight speaks to leading experts on the US and North Korea to help us understand what is really going on and how to avoid the unimaginable.\n\nA lot separates The United States of America and North Korea - the U.S. is the world's most powerful democracy while N. Korea is a totalitarian dictatorship. However, perhaps similarities can be drawn between the leaders of each country... it could be said that their personalities are both unpredictable and controversial.", "The flag is a symbol, and there is no agreement as to what it actually symbolizes. By design, the flag's thirteen stripes stand for the original 13 states, none of which would ban slavery. The 14th state, Vermont, was the first state to ban slavery, doing it weakly in its 1777 state constitution (not that the principle was enforced: in 1802 the Town of Windsor sued a State Supreme Court justice to get him to take care of an elderly, infirm slave he had dumped on town welfare; the town lost the case). The original flag had 13 stars for those same original 13 states, and it took over 70 years before all 36 stars in the 1865 flag represented states without slavery (but not states without racist Jim Crow laws and the freedom to lynch without consequence). The colors of the stars and stripes had no meaning in 1777, when it was adopted, as distinct from the colors of the Great Seal that did have meaning.\n\nThen there's the Star Spangled Banner, written by a slave owner in celebration of the defense of a slave state in a battle against the British. The British force included a contingent of former slaves who were promised freedom if they fought for the British. How many people at the beginning of a sports event understand \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\" in its deepest historical irony?\n\nAll in all, the typical American flag ritual is an exercise in mindless obedience in which any talk of real meaning interferes with the underlying objective of fealty to the state. The ritual is totemic and totalitarian, but not so extreme as the Two Minutes Hate required by the Party in George Orwell's novel \"1984.\" The difference is one of degree, not kind, and the enemy in both instances is rational, individual thought.\n\nMindless obedience has long been a goal of self-appointed patriots, wrapping themselves in the flag to defend indefensible domestic injustice or criminal wars (both of which we have more than our share these days). There is no meaning in the demand to \"respect\" any abstract symbol, much less one as drenched in horrifying contradiction as the American flag. In a mature world, respect is what you earn, not what you demand. In a mature world, a person is respected for who and what he or she is and does, not for any office or position of authority. We do not live in a mature world.\n\nSome quarterbacks are more obtuse than others\n\nMore than a year ago, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick first sat quietly, then kneeled during the national anthem at the beginning of his team's games. The gesture was quiet, respectful, and principled. And Kaepernick was articulate in his explanation that he was objecting to bigotry and injustice in America, and especially to police suffering no consequences for shooting and killing unarmed black men. For this objection, he has been blacklisted by the National Football League owners, the same owners who turkey-danced in all directions last weekend in a panic to find the right response to an intensity of protest they mostly neither shared nor understood, beyond the need for public relations management.\n\nNo one has a coherent argument for saluting the flag, because there isn't one. The flag ritual is an expression of our secular religion, American Exceptionalism. Coherence and reason are at best irrelevant and require suppression before they spread and become a threat. The result is widespread confusion among a large portion of the population, expressed as sincerely and sadly as anyone by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. Brees started by making it about President Trump, which it's not, and then went on to say with inarticulate imprecision: \"I disagree with what the President said and how he said it. I think it's very unbecoming of the office of the President of the United States to talk like that to the great people like that.\"\n\nThe rest of the Drew Brees statement got even more disconnected in its thought pattern:\n\nWell, let me say this first: Do I think that there is inequality in this country? Yes, I do. Do I think that there is racism? Yes, I do. I think there's inequality for women, for women in the workplace. I think that there's inequality for people of color, for minorities, for immigrants.\n\nBut as it pertains to the National Anthem, I will always feel that if you are an American, that the National Anthem is the opportunity for us all to stand up together, to be unified and to show respect for our country, to show respect for what it stands for, the birth of our nation.\n\nWe will -- there will always be issues with our country. There will always be things that we're battling, and we should all be striving to make those things better.\n\nBut if the protest becomes that we're going to sit down or kneel or not show respect to the flag of the United States of America and everything that it symbolizes and everything that it stands for and everything that our country has been through to get to this point, I do not agree with that.\n\nI feel like that is a unifying thing.\n\nThe national anthem and standing for the national anthem and looking at the flag with your hand over your heart is a unifying thing that should bring us all together and say, \"You know what? We know that things are not where they should be, but we will continue to work and strive to make things better, to bring equality to all people: men, women, no matter what your race, creed, religion - it doesn't matter - equality for all.\" But if you're an American, then I will always believe that we should be standing, showing respect to our flag with our hand over our heart.\n\nWell, that's just nuts. And it hasn't worked. Historically, all the flag worship in the world has done little to assure justice. Like an ungodly number of his fellow citizens, Brees is deep in American denial. His is a common knee-jerk response, absent logical thought despite some accurate perceptions. Yes, it sort of sounds good - until you try to figure out what it means. Knee-jerk reactions are not about knees but jerks. And when people like Brees are standing for the national anthem, what are they really standing for?\n\nIs this a tipping point? Are we watching a fad or a movement?\n\nWhen Colin Kaepernick was protesting alone in 2016, it's doubtful even he expected to see so many NFL players and owners expressing such solidarity and support in 2017. Granted, the message was muddled, as some players kneeled, some linked arms, some stayed in the locker room, and so on, with no clear message emerging beyond, perhaps, some disgruntlement at being dissed by Trump. The game is on, but it's not clear yet what the game is, and no clear leadership has emerged. But the legitimacy of professional American athletes protesting, even in the mildest way, is a new thing. If the protest expands and endures and coheres, it could be a very good thing for the country. These protestors include an inordinate number of new millionaires who have decided not to forget what they know about being black and brown in this America. And for anyone wondering what that means, there's America's response to storms in Texas and Florida, and America's virtual abandonment of Puerto Rico, as Trump blames the looted colony for being at the mercy of the United States. Puerto Ricans are American citizens who serve in the US military at disproportionately high rates. Tell them about saluting the flag.\n\nAnd now sports protest has spread from professional football to major league baseball, although just barely. On September 23, Oakland Athletics rookie catcher Bruce Maxwell became first major league baseball player to kneel for the national anthem, hat over his heart and a teammate's hand on his shoulder. Maxwell was born on a US military base in Germany. He is the son of a career soldier. Maxwell's statement after the event had a coherence Drew Brees should envy:\n\nThe point of my kneeling is not to disrespect our military. It's not to disrespect our constitution. My hand was over my heart because I love this country. I've had plenty of family members, including my father, that have bled for this country, that continue to serve for this country. At the end of the day, this is the best country on the planet. I am and forever will be an American citizen, and I'm more than forever grateful for being here. But my kneeling is what is getting the attention, because I'm kneeling for the people that don't have a voice. This goes beyond the black community. This goes beyond the Hispanic community. Because right now we're having a racial divide in all types of people. It's being practiced from the highest power that we have in this country, and he's basically saying that it's OK to treat people differently. My kneeling, the way I did it, was to symbolize the fact that I'm kneeling for a cause, but I'm in no way or form disrespecting my country or my flag.\n\nMaxwell is, intentionally or not, echoing Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address in 1861, when he said, with seven states already seceded from the union for the sake of slavery:\n\nWe are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\n\nWe have no president today capable of such words, and even less capable of such sentiments. That understanding is part of what drives NFL players to demonstrate, however inchoately. From Kaepernick to Maxwell, professional athletes are in touch with our better angels, and this is something new in American life. It is enough to give one hope, at least for the moment. Maybe they will be bullied back into silence and mindless obedience by the screechers demanding respect - respect for the flag, respect for the military, respect for the police even though they keep killing unarmed black people (and others). The screechers know no boundaries and are unburdened by integrity; they want only consent by any means necessary. But they are screeching for a despicable president who earns disrespect daily, so maybe hundreds, even thousands of over-privileged professional athletes will become America's saving grace. We're a long way from there. But wouldn't that be an amazing example of giving something back?\n\n_______", "Right-wingers conflate nationalism with patriotism. But they're not the same thing. Patriots love their country because it does good things; for nationalists it's our country right or wrong. A lot of stuff nationalists call patriotic couldn't possibly be more un-American.\n\nThe singing of the national anthem before sporting events, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, are prime examples.\n\nThe latest nationalism vs. patriotism controversy arrives courtesy of Colin Kaepernick, the African-American pro football player blackballed by the NFL for kneeling in silent protest over police shootings of blacks rather than stand for the signing of the national anthem alongside his teammates and fans before games. The \"take a knee\" movement has spread throughout the league, largely in response to President Trump's crude remark that those who refuse to stand during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" are \"sons of bitches.\"\n\nAt football games and similar events where the anthem is sung, standers far outnumber kneelers -- and that's weird. Because if one person is kneeling against police brutality, then it stands to reason that standing up means you support cops gunning down unarmed black people. Are there really that many racists?\n\nThat, and when you stop to think about it, the whole idea of rote rituals to prove our loyalty run completely counter to what most Americans, liberal or conservative, think their country is about.\n\nAs I have written before, lefties and righties don't have the same ambitions for the U.S. Following the tradition of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Left idealizes individual rights. They dream of a country where everyone is not only created equal, but treated accordingly. The Right values empire. Rightists' ideal America is a global military and economic superpower.\n\nStill, the two sides have something in common. They want to be left alone, to live their lives as free of government interference as possible. Progressives want the government out of their bedrooms. Traditionalists want it out of their incomes. Totalitarianism -- a form of government whose control over citizens' daily lives leads to the requirement that everyone attend one meeting after another and report dissent to the authorities -- could no more catch on here than North Korean-style displays of signs flipped by synchronized flags or parades of military hardware (though Trump wants to start those).\n\nLike the singing of the anthem at games, the Pledge of Allegiance reflects a totalitarian impulse you find in fascist and authoritarian regimes, not democracies. The U.S. and Canada are the only countries on earth where national anthems are played at the start of sporting events. Even in many authoritarian states, the requirement that children (and athletes) swear fealty to the nation (or, as here, its flag) would be considered too creepy to contemplate.\n\nWhen your country is crazier than Zimbabwe, it's time to take stock -- even if you're a Republican.\n\nOther nations require oaths of allegiance from those taking public office, like members of parliament. Some ask the same of foreigners seeking to become naturalized citizens. But the U.S. may be the only nation on earth to have a widely-used pledge of allegiance.\n\nChildren who refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance are routinely punished, criticized and ostracized, even in public schools. I know -- it happened to me in elementary school. Kaepernick, a top-tier athlete, has been denied employment. These are obvious violations of the all-American value of free speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nThe addition of \"under God\" in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy era and its rancid loyalty oaths, further violates another core principle of Americanism, the freedom to worship as you please or not at all as protected under the Establishment Clause of the US. Constitution.\n\nIn one respect, however, the Pledge of Allegiance owes its origins to something that couldn't be more American: a huckster out to make a few extra bucks.\n\nWhy do Americans pledge allegiance to the \"flag,\" as opposed to the nation or its government? It boils down to capitalist greed. The origins of the Pledge date to 1892, when James B. Upham, the marketing executive of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion used the 400 anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas to promote a conference in honor of the American flag. He pushed the Pledge in his magazine as a way to promote nationalism and sell flags to public schools. Schoolhouses purchased 26,000 flags the first year alone.\n\nKids reciting the pledge were supposed to raise their arms at the same time -- yep, the Hitler \"sieg heil\" salute before Hitler. World War II put an end to that in American schools.\n\nHaving traveled extensively, I have observed that the countries whose governments insist upon the most extravagant displays of nationalism line up neatly with those with the least personal freedom. In authoritarian China and the police state of Turkmenistan, national flags and banners extolling slogans and quotes of the ruling party festoon every government office and pedestrian overpass. As Turkey moves away from democracy and closer to autocracy, Turkish flag stickers multiply on automobiles.\n\nIt is the opposite in the European democracies. A Frenchman who hung a French flag from his front porch would be ridiculed by his neighbors, socialist and Le Pen supporter alike. It is not that the French and the Dutch and the Spanish and other Europeans do not love their countries as much as Americans do; if anything, most Europeans are grateful that their countries are not like ours. They are patriots. And they remember World War II, when those who liked to wave flags and insisted on loyalty oaths to the state turned out to be dangerous.\n\nEveryone should sit out the singing of the national anthem. It's archaic and uncomfortably reminiscent of fascism.\n\nIt is time to leave the Pledge of Allegiance where it belongs, on the dungheap of history, remembered as a clever way to move piles of colored cloth.", "Thigh-High Politics is an Op-Ed column by Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca that breaks down the news, provides resources for the resistance, and just generally refuses to accept toxic nonsense.\n\nDuring a football game in August of 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem to protest police brutality. He started kneeling instead of sitting after he met with former Army Green Beret Nate Boyer. At the time, Kaepernick couldn't have known that quiet action would unfurl into a landmark battle in the ongoing culture war led by Donald Trump, if only because Barack Obama was president at the time, but he did want to start a conversation about the violent, institutionalized means by which black lives are too often disregarded in this country.\n\nPatriotism is about love for one's country. Kaepernick risked his career -- and you'll note that he is effectively blackballed this season -- through his efforts to draw attention to the police killings of unarmed black men in America. This is a despicable mark of shame on our national moral character, and Kaepernick sat, then kneeled, to push us toward the need for redemption. All of this has been obscured by yet another temper tantrum by our commander in chief.\n\nFast-forward from Kaepernick's initial demonstration in August 2016 to an Alabama rally Trump spoke at earlier this month for the since-defeated gubernatorial candidate Luther Strange. Perhaps distracted by a shiny thing, Trump's speech ventured into sports: \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'get that son of a b*tch off the field right now, he's fired?'\" he said.\n\nThen, the president seemed struck by his own commentary and, of course, began tweeting more thoughts on the topic. His feud with the NFL eventually expanded to the NBA, when he disinvited the league's champions from attending the White House, after Warriors point guard Stephen Curry expressed hesitation about the visit. This manufactured \"feud\" has only continued to escalate.\n\nAs part of his Twitter rant, Trump issued a ruling on the proper conduct during the national anthem. \"Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable,\" he wrote in one of the many, many tweets he has fired off on this topic. \"The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race,\" he wrote in another. \"It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!\"\n\nIn short, Trump has spent the past week using the concept of national devotion for personal gain. Patriotism doesn't belong to conservatives, and it certainly doesn't belong to Donald Trump, a man who has insulted war heroes and accused the military of theft, and who ran an entire campaign based on America no longer being great. In his typical way of scrambling the dialogue, Trump is trying to push the conversation away from protest to its direct object: the flag. He has set up a dichotomy for NFL players, in which kneeling or not kneeling dictates love for America, and it comes with dire consequences. One can either align with him, and refuse to take part in protest, or unleash the wrath of the White House, which we saw in full force in the attacks on Jemele Hill and ESPN mere weeks ago. Regardless of your position on national anthem positions, make no mistake about this: The president is manipulating the symbol of the flag and corresponding concept of patriotism as an extension of his power, and that's about as un-American as it gets.\n\nPatriotism, again, encompasses a dedication to and a love for one's country. But Trump's behavior appears to be a lot more like totalitarianism mixed with racism. American devotion can and should mean dedicating oneself to the battle for equity. This country cannot be great until we are all equal, and certainly that cannot be the case when black lives are still too often violently disregarded by the state. In August 2016, Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem, because he was willing to sacrifice himself in order to insist on bringing that undeniable injustice into the mainstream dialogue. If you believe in the American project of fighting for a truer, more democratic society, that's a patriotic act, if there ever was one.", "The announcement sent a message to religious leaders about the balance of power in the kingdom.\n\nIt's good news that women will soon be able to drive in Saudi Arabia. But as a milestone, it isn't primarily a marker of sex equality, which remains a distant objective in the kingdom. Rather, it's an important indication that the monarchy now thinks it doesn't have to defer to the country's religious establishment.\n\nThat's a remarkable development that may allow some modernization -- but also heralds a move away from the separation of powers and toward consolidation of absolute authority in a totalitarian king.\n\nQuickTake Saudi Arabia's Strains\n\nAlthough it's little understood in the West, the Saudi dynasty was built on a foundational partnership between kingly and religious authority. On the worldly side was the royal House of Saud, going back to the 18th century founder Muhammad bin Saud. On the spiritual side was what is called the House of the Sheikh. That name refers to the Arabian sheikh par excellence: Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th century founder of Wahhabism.\n\nThe partnership's modern form was established during the career of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding monarch of the current Saudi state, who died in 1953. The basic constitutional idea is that the religious scholars, associated with the House of the Sheikh, provide the formal legal justification for the monarch's rule.\n\nIn theory, the scholars get to determine what rules are consistent with Islamic law. The monarch then carries out those rulings. His authority to govern legitimately is ultimately supposed to rest on his compliance with the Shariah as interpreted by the scholars.\n\nIn practice, like all separation of powers, however rudimentary, there is negotiation and compromise. Oil wealth has given the monarchy far more influence and therefore room for maneuver than it would otherwise have. Scholars can be co-opted or at least influenced through lucrative government posts.\n\nBut the religious scholars have never forgotten that their institutional power can only be preserved if they continue to say no to certain reforms sought by the monarchy. The scholars' background threat is that they might withdraw their support for the monarch. They couldn't bring down a king on their own, but they could lend their moral support to a coup. That has been all the leverage they traditionally needed.\n\nThe ban on women driving has long been a highly visible, symbolic instance of the religious scholars' exercise of a veto power over the monarchy. For least 25 years, perhaps longer, Saudi kings have been delicately exploring the possibility of allowing women to drive. But the scholars have always given a clear no.\n\nThe reason had less to do with any really compelling principle of Islamic law than with the scholars' institutional need to demonstrate their authority. Religious conservatism is the scholars' brand and the source of their power.\n\nThat's why the driving announcement is so important for the distribution of power in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman is engaged in a historic experiment: the most significant attempt to consolidate the monarch's power in the last 75 years of Saudi history. That involves marginalizing the rest of the royal family and focusing authority in his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Crucially, it also involves weakening the authority of the religious establishment.\n\nBy permitting driving, King Salman is telling Saudis that the clerics now have less power than they did before. And he's sending a message to the clerics themselves: be flexible or be ignored.\n\nThis is a delicate game, to say the least. The steps Salman and Muhammad have taken to centralize power leave them vulnerable to pushback from other members of the royal family who might fantasize about trying to replace the crown prince and maybe even his father. Alienating the religious establishment would give clerics the incentive to back a competing candidate.\n\nIn a sense, then, this is a test of the traditional system of clerical influence. The king and the crown prince are betting that the old system has been sufficiently weakened that it will now fail.\n\nIf that happens, the consequences will be major -- and very tricky.\n\nFrom the standpoint of many Western onlookers, the collapse or at least great weakening of the conservative religious scholars will seem like a happy result. After all, the scholars have long blocked egalitarian reforms.\n\nYet it's important to remember that, notwithstanding their conservatism, the scholars have also balanced and to a degree checked the monarchy. Unfettered power tends to become not merely authoritarian, but totalitarian. And an unchecked monarchy may in the long run have drawbacks for Saudi subjects, male or female.\n\nIt's natural to celebrate allowing women to drive. But real sex equality is still several generations away in Saudi Arabia, if that. The true development is yet another increase in royal prerogative. The experiment is under way. The outcome remains uncertain.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode of the series seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called \"Thomas & Friends,\" began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: \"Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.\" I would hum along. How could I possibly have imagined that, decades later, I would get lost in obscure corners of the Internet where people interpret the show -- at length -- as a depiction of a premodern corporate-totalitarian dystopia?\n\nIf you have watched the series and not encountered such readings of it, you may assume that these interpretations are ridiculous. In that case, you should spend four minutes with \"The Sad Story of Henry,\" a segment from \"Thomas & Friends\" that aired on the second episode of the first season at PBS. (In the U.S., it was retitled \"Come Out, Henry!\") It begins on a drizzly day in Sodor, the fictional island in the Irish Sea that serves as the show's setting. Henry, the curmudgeonly train, is afraid to come out of his tunnel, because \"the rain will ruin my lovely green paint and red stripes.\" Then Sir Topham Hatt, the railway director, who is also known as the Fat Controller, arrives on the scene. (He looks like Monopoly's Rich Uncle Pennybags but with eyes that have almost surely witnessed murder.) The Fat Controller orders the passengers to pull Henry out with a rope, but Henry won't budge. They push him from the other direction, to no avail. (The Fat Controller declines to physically participate in this effort, citing \"doctor's orders.\") The passengers then tell Henry that it's not raining; Henry, perhaps noticing that everyone still has their umbrellas out, refuses to move.\n\nRealizing that the day's workflow is irrevocably disrupted, Fat Controller decides that Henry must be punished -- for life. \"We shall take away your rails, and leave you here for always and always,\" he tells Henry. As Henry's face contorts into anguish and the background music toots a series of Oompa Loompa faux-glum flourishes, railway employees build a brick prison around Henry, leaving only half of his face visible. His train friends pass by: one snubs him, and another whistles hello. Henry has no steam left to whistle back. He spends his days alone, soot-streaked, wondering if he'll ever be allowed to go back to work. The last line of the segment is the narrator saying, \"I think he deserved his punishment, don't you?\" In the U.S. version, this voice-over is tweaked so that Henry's fate seems temporary. But the original version is still on YouTube, and it's comically bleak. As one commenter writes, \"What moral lesson are kids supposed to learn from this? Do as you're told or you will be entombed forever in the darkness to die?\"\n\nThe Thomas the Tank Engine universe was the brainchild of an Anglican minister, the Reverend Wilbert Awdry, who in 1942 began spinning stories about trains to amuse his son Christopher, who had come down with the measles. The first volume in Awdry's \"The Railway Series\" was published in 1945. Awdry wrote twenty-six more books, the last one in 1972; after his father's death, Christopher wrote sixteen more. Episodes of \"Shining Time Station\" are mostly faithful adaptations of \"The Railway Series,\" though Awdry's plots are embellished onscreen with a colorful crew of additional human characters and an impish aesthetic courtesy, of the set designer Wayne White, who also worked on \"Pee-Wee's Playhouse.\" When I watched \"Shining Time Station,\" I was too young and too absorbed by the fever-dream visual textures to take in anything that was actually happening. But through the dedicated and comprehensive Thomas the Tank Engine Wikia, as well as a smattering of critical assessments and message-board threads from dedicated viewers, I have become a little obsessed with the show's repressive, authoritarian soul.\n\nIt is clear from his work that Awdry disliked change, venerated order, and craved the administration of punishment. Henry wasn't the only train to receive a death sentence. In one episode, a manager tells a showoff engine named Smudger that he's going to \"make him useful at last,\" and then turns Smudger into a generator, never to move again. (There are several \"R.I.P. Smudger\" tribute videos on YouTube.) In another episode, a double-decker bus named Bulgy comes to the station and talks about revolution -- \"Free the roads from railway tyranny!\" he cries. He is quickly labelled a \"scarlet deceiver,\" trapped under a bridge, and turned into a henhouse. A recurring storyline involves the \"troublesome trucks,\" which are disciplined into fearful obedience through public, symbolic punishments. Their leader, S. C. Ruffey, is pulled in two different directions until he breaks into pieces -- \"I guess the lesson is that if someone is bullying you, kill them?\" a YouTube commenter writes -- and, in another episode, a \"spiteful\" brake van is crushed into bits.\n\nBy the time Awdry wrote \"The Railway Series,\" the railway industry had shifted away from steam and toward diesel and electric. But on the Island of Sodor steam locomotives are permanently on top. The caste system is very rigid. There is one diesel engine, a black train known just as \"Diesel,\" who struggles to prove that he's as useful as the steam trains. Less useful than Diesel are the female passenger coaches named Annie and Clarabel, who are awarded to Thomas as prizes after he helps with a train breakdown. (More information on the class and gender hierarchy of Thomas the Tank Engine can be found in \"A Very Useful Engine: The Politics of Thomas and Friends,\" a 2009 article by Shauna Wilton, a professor at the University of Alberta.)\n\nOn Sodor, the steam trains engage in constant competition for big jobs, more work, and the Fat Controller's approval. Anthropomorphized trains in literature tend to be hard workers, but one Tumblr thread holds that Thomas and friends have other motivations. The show \"canonically takes place in a train post-apocalypse where the Island of Sodor is the only safe zone in a totalitarian dystopia in which steam trains are routinely killed and their body parts are sold or cannibalized for repair,\" a Tumblr user named frog-and-toad-are-friends argues, citing one of Awdry's books, \"Stepney the 'Bluebell' Engine.\" In that book, a green train named Percy expresses his fear of the \"Other Railway,\" which is what British Railways, the United Kingdom's nationalized rail company, is called on Sodor: \" 'Engines on the Other Railway aren't safe now. Their controllers are cruel. They don't like engines anymore. They put them on cold damp sidings, and then,' Percy nearly sobbed, 'they . . . they c-c-cut them up.' \" (The accompanying illustration features two terrified trains facing dismemberment, and, behind them, a train with a chilling black void where its face used to be.) Another Tumblr user replies, \"Maybe that's just what Railway Management wants the engines to think.\" And, in fact, it does seem that the Fat Controller maintains authoritarian rule through disinformation. In the foreword to the book, Awdry clarifies that British Railways actually supports the preservation of steam engines. It's just a little joke that Percy fears for his life! (If you need some cheering up after this investigation, I recommend \"Goths Rave to Thomas the Tank Engine,\" a mashup that makes use of the show's iconic transition music and has accumulated more than three million views.)\n\nThough \"Shining Time Station\" ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. \"Thomas & Friends\" has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator. In 2009, the show went completely C.G.I. In 2014, the actor who had voiced Thomas for the previous five years quit, saying that the successful show was exploiting him by paying \"a very low wage.\" The trains seem overdue for a similar revolution.", "My hands are hardly clean when it comes to honoring the First Amendment on college campuses. Forty-five years ago, after the U.S. mining of Haiphong harbor in the Vietnam War, I participated in student protests at Columbia that resulted in the shutdown of some facilities. It was atrociously arrogant behavior and something I've long regretted, even though I haven't changed my mind much about the wisdom of that conflict.\n\nI remember vividly, and uncomfortably, an incident in which a single spirited student who opposed the demonstrations tried to break through a line blocking a door. When he was stopped, he began to shout, \"Fascists,\" a description that seemed odd in the moment but which in fact contained a kernel of truth. It was one thing if protesters wanted to boycott classes to make a point, but their more aggressive tactics were utterly out of line.\n\nYet however misguided some conduct of that time -- not only at Columbia but at many universities -- its fundamental purpose was to seek change in national policy, not to dictate conformity of political opinion among fellow students and faculty. Moreover, the idea that students should be protected from \"hate speech\" and other opinions that offend them, and should actively suppress any such opinions in their midst, remained far outside the mainstream, and certainly never entered my mind.\n\nNow, alas, such views are apparently rising toward majority status among educated young people. A recent Brookings Institution national survey of undergraduates found not only astonishing ignorance about the nature of the First Amendment but also ominous levels of approval for vocal and even physical attempts to silence opposing views.\n\nUCLA professor John Villasenor, who conducted the survey, found that a plurality of students believe the First Amendment does not protect hate speech (of course it does) and a majority thinks a school is \"legally required\" to present opposing viewpoints to a speaker \"known for making statements that many students consider to be offensive and hurtful\" (there is no such requirement).\n\nFar more disturbingly, a slight majority also said it was acceptable for a student group to disrupt the speech of a controversial figure \"by loudly and repeatedly shouting so that the audience cannot hear the speaker,\" while nearly one-fifth said it was acceptable to use violence \"to prevent the speaker from speaking.\"\n\nVillasenor is understandably alarmed by the results. Not only is freedom of expression on U.S. campuses \"deeply imperiled\" by such attitudes, he wrote in a Brookings commentary, but so is freedom in the broader society. After all, if \"a large fraction of college students believe, however incorrectly, that offensive speech is unprotected by the First Amendment,\" he explained, \"that view will inform the decisions they make as they move into positions of increasing authority later in their careers.\"\n\n\"Increasing authority\" includes positions on the federal bench. And while judicial protection of free speech is currently quite robust in America, there is no reason to believe this happy state of affairs is set for all time.\n\nBut are students today actually less tolerant of dissent than previous generations or have undergraduates always harbored an authoritarian streak? Although Villasenor told me he is unaware of survey findings that would document attitudes toward hate speech over time, he did point to data compiled since 1967 on whether colleges should \"ban extreme speakers from campus.\" That data, from the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, reveals, for example, that 43 percent of freshmen in 2015 said it was OK to ban speakers, nearly double the average percentage who agreed during the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe percentage of freshmen in the survey willing to \"prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus\" -- like \"extreme speakers,\" a notoriously expansive concept -- has also risen since the question was first asked, to 71 percent in 2015.\n\nAnyone who doubts the real-world consequences of such attitudes has failed to follow the surge in stories this year of campus speakers being shouted down and threatened. Even progressives have been targeted for alleged missteps, as when Evergreen State College professor Bret Weinstein objected to a \"Day of Absence\" in which whites were asked to stay off campus. Weinstein's abuse at the hands of students is fairly well known, but he was by no means the only staff member to face intimidation. Emails obtained by Wall Street Journal writer Jillian Kay Melchior through a public-records request show other instances, including one involving Nancy Koppelman, an American studies and humanities professor.\n\nKoppelman described being \"followed by white students who yelled and cursed at me, accused me of not caring about black and brown bodies, and claimed that if I did care I would follow their orders.\"\n\n\"The only thing they would accept was my obedience,\" she wrote. The encounter so unnerved the professor, Melchior reports, \"that she was left physically shaking. \"\n\nIf the harrowing incident sounds reminiscent, in miniature, of scenes from China's Cultural Revolution, that's because it reflects a similar totalitarian mindset.\n\nVillasensor believes colleges need \"to do a better job fostering freedom of expression on their campuses,\" while middle and high schools should focus more attention on the First Amendment and constitutional principles. Of course they should, but the likelihood of either occurring is not good.\n\nI'd settle for seeing a greater willingness among progressives and journalists to denounce disruptive and violent left-wing fanatics like Antifa with the same fervor they direct (correctly) toward white nationalists and bigots. If the 20th century taught us anything, it's that a totalitarian mindset, once triumphant, will exact a frightful toll in oppression no matter which side of the spectrum it calls home.", "Thousands of police pour into Barcelona as authorities prepare for possible violence\n\nONE of Spain's biggest political crisis since democracy returned is set to reach a head in Sunday's Catalan independence vote.\n\nThousands of police reinforcements, including around 25 from Mallorca, are heading from all over Spain to Barcelona with authorities fearing widespread public disorder.\n\nSome 6,000 officers are to be housed in cruise ships moored off the Catalan capital and Tarragona ahead of the illegal referendum.\n\nThis week, in scenes reminiscent of soldiers leaving for war, crowds of flag-waving supporters around Spain cheered Guardia Civil convoys en route to Barcelona.\n\nBalearic president Francina Armengol has denied being pro-independence in a heated parliamentary debate with PP officials, but attacked Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's stance.\n\n\"The PP government despises the autonomies,\" said the Socialist PSIB general secretary.\n\nShe added Rajoy was 'wrong' to seek 'only a judicial and police solution, and not a political solution'.\n\nSunday's planned vote has been declared illegal by the Constitutional Court, with the Catalan government defying an order to half the referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, PSIB spokesman Andreu Alcover has backed the idea of a referendum agreed between Madrid and the Catalan government.\n\n\"The referendum should be agreed and come with guarantees.

That came after they sold more than $7 billion in cash equities this year through mid-September.\n\nSome of the buying preceded even local media suggestions that an election would be called. But it came as Abe's Cabinet approval rating jumped on his response to North Korea firing missiles over the country. Abe has previously called a snap election when his ratings were high, and Japanese stocks tend to climb in the run-up to such votes.\n\n\"If the ruling party wins, Japanese shares will rise even more,\" said Norihiro Fujito, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo. \"That's why hedge funds bought like crazy.\"\n\nNorth Korea unexpectedly refrained from launching a missile on the weekend of its founding anniversary on September 9. Polls later showed Japanese people approved of how Abe was handling the increasing threat from the totalitarian state. Abe's Cabinet approval rating topped its disapproval rating for the first time in three months, rising 8 percentage points to 50 per cent, according to a Yomiuri newspaper poll published on September 12. A few days later, local press began speculating about an election.\n\nThe benchmark Topix index jumped to a more-than-two-year high on September 19, the first trading day after the reports started to appear.\n\nThere are generally good reasons to buy Japanese stocks before election announcements.

It would \"be viewed positively, especially by overseas investors,\" they wrote.\n\nIn fact, since Abe assumed office at the end of 2012, the perceived success or failure of Abenomics has served as a key barometer of foreign appetite for Japanese equities. In 2013, when Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda unleashed his unprecedented stimulus program, foreigners pumped $133 billion into the country's stock market. By 2015, they had become net sellers as the sheen wore off Abe's policy program. The next year, they sold a lot more, and they're sellers again this year.\n\nHajime Sakai, chief fund manager at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo, said today's data on the foreigner buying binge in futures is a more important signal than a separate set of figures that showed continued selling of cash equities last week.\n\n\"To read what foreigners are trying to do, their moves in the futures market seems like a good place to look,\" he said. \"They were hurriedly covering their shorts.\"\n\nIf hedge funds are betting that this election will strengthen Abe's position and revive his policy programme, it's far from a sure thing. Opinion polls show Abe's Liberal Democratic Party is well ahead, recovering after months of conflict-of-interest scandals, but anything short of the two-thirds majority his coalition controls could prompt his party to oust him in a leadership vote next year. Abe has said he'll resign if his ruling coalition fails to win a simple majority.\n\nMaking matters more complicated, a new party headed by the popular governor of Tokyo started this week, and another opposition group is considering merging with it.\n\n\"Everything depends on the outcome of the election,\" Fujito said.\n\nEven the $18 billion economic package that Abe announced when he called the election is being called into question.

The state punishes reading, for example, by amputating a hand.\n\nIn the story's fictional setting, worldwide fertility rates have plummeted and a totalitarian state called Gilead has taken power in what was formerly the United States. Women who are capable of conceiving, known as handmaids, are subjected to inhumane conditions and forced to bear children for the high-ranking officials of Gilead.\n\nMany viewers have commented on the topicality of the show, the actors and showrunners themselves noting subtle parallels between the fictional series and reality in present-day America. Women have protested against abortion bills in multiple locations, including Ohio and Ireland, by donning outfits inspired by the show.\n\nAlthough plot points in \"The Handmaid's Tale\" mirror events that have occurred during President Trump's administration, such as mass protests and threats to reproductive rights, the story of the women of Gilead serves as a broader warning against the danger of complacency - a message that extends beyond a four-year presidency and one the series captures beautifully in its haunting narratives of the handmaids.\n\nMargaret Atwood, the author of the novel the show is based on, has revealed many of the story's influences, including religious influences, most notably the Puritan colonies of the 17th century, and political influences, such as public hostility in Cold War-era Germany.\n\nGilead's backstory is sparse. Little is revealed about the political or social catalysts that sparked the rise of the state, which redistributes focus to the characters themselves and their personal narratives. The show's broad setting also allows viewers to apply its themes to many social and political situations in the real world.\n\nTiming plays an essential part in establishing the show's core themes. The juxtaposition between the normalcy of protagonist Offred's (Elizabeth Moss) life just a few years prior and her present role as a household slave leads viewers to wonder what triggered such as drastic change in such a short amount of time.\n\nThe shift between Offred's two lives unfolds gradually at the start and grows increasingly chaotic. First, Offred and all her female coworkers are let go by the company they work for, then her bank account is drained and reallocated to the male of her household. Throughout all this, Offred and her friend Moira (Samira Wiley) ignore the warning signs, and when they finally decide to escape to the Canadian border with their families, it's too late. Their complacency forms the entire premise of the show.\n\nOffred is not the only character suffering the consequences of her complaency. Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski), the wife of high-level Commander, Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes), played a pivotal role in the establishment of Gilead as a well-known reactionary and conservative figure who wrote a book titled \"A Woman's Place.\" However, she stayed silent even as she slowly realized the life she wished for wasn't the life she wanted, and because of her quiet acceptance, spends her days knitting clothes for a child that may never come and is even barred from reading the book she authored.\n\nWatching from the outside, it's hard not to plead with the onscreen characters to do something - leave, escape, protest, run. But the audience can do nothing but watch passively as the show's characters continue to rationalize the situation happening around them. The dark outcome of their complacency is fictional, but the same rationalization has contributed to many real-life political conflicts.\n\nThe rise of Gilead and the lives of its citizens acts as a loose metaphor for the unintended consequences of failing to speak up or take action. And although Puritan-inspired capes and white bonnets probably won't appear in the distant future, the image serves as a cautionary tale for all, a timeless lesson to take heed of - if you sit on your hands for too long, they might get cut off.", "Equities tend to climb in Japan after elections are announced\n\nIn the two weeks before Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election, foreign investors using the futures market -- which are often hedge funds -- suddenly turned hugely positive on Japanese shares.\n\nForeigners bought a net 2.1 trillion yen ($19 billion) of Japanese stock futures from Sept. 11 to 22, according to data released by Osaka Exchange Inc. on Thursday and last week.

But as a milestone, it isn't primarily a marker of sex equality, which remains a distant objective in the kingdom. Rather, it's an important indication that the monarchy now thinks it doesn't have to defer to the country's religious establishment.\n\nThat's a remarkable development that may allow some modernization -- but also heralds a move away from the separation of powers and toward consolidation of absolute authority in a totalitarian king.\n\nAlthough it's little understood in the West, the Saudi dynasty was built on a foundational partnership between kingly and religious authority. On the worldly side was the royal House of Saud, going back to the 18th century founder Muhammad bin Saud. On the spiritual side was what is called the House of the Sheikh. That name refers to the Arabian sheikh par excellence: Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th century founder of Wahhabism.\n\nThe partnership's modern form was established during the career of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding monarch of the current Saudi state, who died in 1953. The basic constitutional idea is that the religious scholars, associated with the House of the Sheikh, provide the formal legal justification for the monarch's rule.\n\nIn theory, the scholars get to determine what rules are consistent with Islamic law. The monarch then carries out those rulings. His authority to govern legitimately is ultimately supposed to rest on his compliance with the Shariah as interpreted by the scholars.\n\nIn practice, like all separation of powers, however rudimentary, there is negotiation and compromise. Oil wealth has given the monarchy far more influence and therefore room for manoeuvre than it would otherwise have. Scholars can be co-opted or at least influenced through lucrative government posts.\n\nBut the religious scholars have never forgotten that their institutional power can only be preserved if they continue to say no to certain reforms sought by the monarchy. The scholars' background threat is that they might withdraw their support for the monarch. They couldn't bring down a king on their own, but they could lend their moral support to a coup. That has been all the leverage they traditionally needed.\n\nThe ban on women driving has long been a highly visible, symbolic instance of the religious scholars' exercise of a veto power over the monarchy. For at least 25 years, perhaps longer, Saudi kings have been delicately exploring the possibility of allowing women to drive. But the scholars have always given a clear no.\n\nThe reason had less to do with any really compelling principle of Islamic law than with the scholars' institutional need to demonstrate their authority. Religious conservatism is the scholars' brand and the source of their power.\n\nThat's why the driving announcement is so important for the distribution of power in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman is engaged in a historic experiment: the most significant attempt to consolidate the monarch's power in the last 75 years of Saudi history. That involves marginalizing the rest of the royal family and focusing authority in his son, crown prince Muhammad bin Salman. Crucially, it also involves weakening the authority of the religious establishment.\n\nBy permitting driving, King Salman is telling Saudis that the clerics now have less power than they did before. And he's sending a message to the clerics themselves: be flexible or be ignored.\n\nThis is a delicate game, to say the least. The steps Salman and Muhammad have taken to centralize power leave them vulnerable to pushback from other members of the royal family who might fantasize about trying to replace the crown prince and maybe even his father. Alienating the religious establishment would give clerics the incentive to back a competing candidate.\n\nIn a sense, then, this is a test of the traditional system of clerical influence. The king and the crown prince are betting that the old system has been sufficiently weakened that it will now fail.\n\nIf that happens, the consequences will be major -- and very tricky.\n\nFrom the standpoint of many Western onlookers, the collapse or at least great weakening of the conservative religious scholars will seem like a happy result. After all, the scholars have long blocked egalitarian reforms.\n\nYet it's important to remember that, notwithstanding their conservatism, the scholars have also balanced and to a degree checked the monarchy. Unfettered power tends to become not merely authoritarian, but totalitarian. And an unchecked monarchy may in the long run have drawbacks for Saudi subjects, male or female.\n\nIt's natural to celebrate allowing women to drive. But real sex equality is still several generations away in Saudi Arabia, if that. The true development is yet another increase in royal prerogative. The experiment is under way. The outcome remains uncertain.

He was one of the speakers at a recent conference in Italy titled \"Contemporary Antisemitism as a Gateway to Terrorism.\"\n\nIn attendance was Barbara Wind, director of the Holocaust Council of Greater MetroWest. From Sept. 13 to 15 she and some 60 other delegates convened at the Vatican, the Italian Parliament, and the University of Rome for a conference on the hatred of Jews as an influence on terrorism, a subject vital to her mission of educating young people about the atrocities of genocide.\n\nUpon her return Wind told NJJN, \"It was very interesting to get a group of Christians, Muslims, and Jews together to focus on anti-Semitism as a springboard for terrorism, hatred, and war.\" The conference was organized by the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism (ISGAP).\n\nNoting that the majority of the world's terror victims are Muslim, she said the motivations of terrorists \"always begins with anti-Semitism that is appreciated by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and extremist Muslims.\"\n\nCharles Asher Small, director of ISGAP International, told NJJN that the core of political Islam is anti-Semitic. \"They took Nazi ideology and fused it with Islamic thought. For too long people have dismissed the anti-Semitism as having something to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"\n\nHe said \"several American administrations have viewed this as a short-term problem. Now we recognize this as a long-term problem.\"\n\nFor instance, Small said, the Obama administration's effort to bring Iran back into the family of nations had \"emboldened a regime that is anti-democratic, anti-American, and certainly anti-Semitic and anti-moderate.\"\n\nTo Wind, it appeared that the moderate Muslims at the conference were \"more concerned than others\" about co-religionists \"who are being seduced into killing themselves, and [about] the backlash it has created against Muslims in general.

He promised a Labour government would take an active role in restructuring the economy. It would introduce a new model of economic management and create a new and dynamic role for the public sector.\n\nMore than once he also talked about economic change being \"managed\", which was pretty obvious code for state-controlled.\n\nOf course, all this has been tried before, again and again, all over the world. And the lessons from economic history are that: 1) such policies prove to be unaffordable and the governments implementing them sink in a sea of debt and deficit; 2) issues of state failure, not market failure, become the dominating feature, with all sorts of unintended consequences from interventionist policies; 3) tax and spend policies undermine the supply side of the economy and competitiveness, with the result that economic growth weakens.\n\nThe inevitable result of all these factors is that it all ends in tears, with savage cuts in public spending.\n\nEconomic history 101 shows that the most prosperous economies are the ones which have chosen freedom and free markets over statism. Free markets have been the greatest wealth creator and driving force for prosperity in history. In stark contrast, socialism has failed everywhere it has been tried.\n\nBefore you quote the Nordics back at me remember that those economies also encourage freedom and competition in public services.\n\nCorbyn blames this \"failed\" doctrine of neoliberalism\" and free markets, when he knows full well that if you look at tax and spend and regulation - a total state intervention index - the state accounts for more than half of the economy. Failed neoliberalism is a straw man.\n\nMoreover, when he proposes policies such as rent controls, he conveniently ignores the fact that the problems in the UK housing market are attributable to government intervention and planning. The idea that the UK housing market is a free market is a joke.\n\nSure, there will always be market failures, but that should be the determinant of whether or not there is state intervention. Ideological hatred of free markets is a lousy way to make policy.\n\nCorbyn wants to extend public services democracy away from Whitehall. True democracy would be the devolution of spending power to every citizen. Be it vouchers in education or payment passports in health, free at the point of use is still possible, but we need a revolution in choice to deliver those public services.\n\nIf somebody tells you they want to take an active role in restructuring the economy, with a new model of economic management that includes a dynamic role for the public sector, ask them where on earth has that ever worked in the history of the world?\n\nRead more: It's all fun and games, until Labour crashes the economy", "Writer says social harmony and peace can only be assured if there is equality and tolerance.\n\nBy Tay Tian Yan\n\nAmerican television series \"The Handmaid's Tale\" bagged this year's Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nThe story takes place some time in the future, when birth rates are at rock bottom and the human species is battling a survival crisis.\n\nThe enraged male-dominated leadership blames it on women who are unwilling or unable to conceive.\n\nSome of the extremists plan to overthrow the United States government and replace it with the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state which overturns the virtues of democracy and freedom.\n\nGilead is ruled by male clerics who vow to build a wholly sanctified nation through the purging of human souls.\n\nAll women, except the clerics' wives, are stripped of their citizens' rights, their assets forfeited.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, the prosecutor's office and the Spanish judiciary have launched an all-out legal assault on the government of Catalonia over its plans to hold a binding referendum on independence on October 1.\n\nAn unprecedented combination of legal action, police deployments and economic sanctions are disrupting the effort to hold the vote, declared illegal by Spain's Constitutional Court, and sowing divisions among the separatist leaders.\n\nIn the latest development, Spanish authorities seem determined to physically prevent Catalans from casting a ballot on Sunday -- setting the stage for a high-voltage climax to one of the gravest political crises the country has faced in the past four decades.\n\nCatalonia's High Court on Wednesday ordered national and regional security forces to prevent any activity connected to setting up polling stations in likely voting locations until Sunday, seal off buildings on that day, including any polling stations that do open, and confiscate computers and all material related to the ballot.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Catalans are expected to take to the streets on Sunday to try and cast a ballot. National police forces from other parts of the country -- probably numbering in the thousands, though the interior ministry hasn't provided a figure -- have been deployed to Catalonia in anticipation of potential unrest in the streets.\n\nThe officers will be tasked with shutting down polling stations if the Catalan regional police -- the Mossos -- are unable or unwilling to do so. Barcelona and Madrid have tussled over control of the regional police, whose loyalty will be tested in the coming days.\n\nThe Spanish government has entered full crisis mode. Rajoy is not expected to attend the European Union's informal summit in Tallinn this week. The finance minister on Tuesday announced that the 2017 budget will be extended to next year over tensions with Basque legislative partners on how to manage the Catalan crisis. Rajoy, however, maintains the backing of three quarters of the Spanish Congress on the Catalan issue.\n\nMadrid considers the basic infrastructure required to hold the referendum to have been \"dismantled,\" Enric Millo, the Spanish government's representative in Catalonia, told reporters Tuesday. But few believe the crisis is anywhere close to an end.\n\nIt's not clear whether any Catalan officials will end up in prison, but it's also possible that many will.\n\nThe sheer scale of the measures the Spanish state has put in place provides an indication of the seriousness with which it views the conflict -- and how difficult the problem will be to resolve even after the vote.\n\nCatalonia's High Court is investigating the entire Catalan Cabinet led by regional President Carles Puigdemont -- as well as five regional lawmakers -- on charges of disobedience, prevarication, and misuse of public funds. The latter crime is punishable with up to eight years in prison.\n\nAnother judge in Barcelona is investigating 20 people on the same charges in a case related to the vote that has been placed under judicial secrecy. Last week, the same judge ordered 41 facilities allegedly connected to the referendum -- including six government offices -- to be raided in Catalonia.\n\nIn the operation, authorities temporarily detained more than a dozen Catalan officials, prompting thousands of people to the streets to protest. Computers and key data belonging to organizers of the referendum were reportedly confiscated.\n\nThe prosecutor's office at Spain's High Court submitted a penal complaint on charges of sedition -- punishable by up to 10 years in prison -- for the protests that day, when supporters of independence and grassroots organizations called on people to surround the buildings where the raids were being conducted, aiming, in the prosecutor's view, at preventing by force the work of the authorities and police agents.\n\nThe prosecutor didn't identify a particular target for the charges, but specifically mentioned the actions taken that day by the leaders of the two biggest pro-independence organizations. On Wednesday, the High Court admitted the prosecutor's complaint and decided to proceed with the investigation, ordering security forces to provide an account of the facts that day and the following.\n\nEarlier, Spain's chief prosecutor ordered a preliminary investigation against more than 700 Catalan mayors who had vowed to cooperate with the referendum, and ordered them to be questioned and detained if they refused to appear before the authorities. He also urged criminal action against two mayors leading city hall associations promoting the referendum on the charges of disobedience, prevarication and misuse of public funds.\n\nIt's not clear whether any Catalan officials will end up in prison, but it's also possible that many will. An investigative judge said that once the criminal justice system starts to roll, it's a very difficult mechanism to stop -- though the central government will have the option of granting pardons.\n\nIn addition to the prosecutions and investigations, police have been sent to hunt down ballot papers and materials related to the referendum, and media organizations have been warned not to broadcast official Catalan campaign advertisements related to the vote. More than a hundred websites related to the referendum have been shut down.\n\nThe central government has also essentially taken over the regional executive's finances to ensure that \"not a single euro\" is spent on the ballot. Banks have been ordered not to allow money transfers from Catalan government accounts without Madrid's consent.\n\nThe pressure -- in particular, threats of financial sanctions -- is starting to create rifts among the separatists.\n\nWhen the Catalan pro-independence newspaper ARA initially complied with the broadcast ban, it came under severe criticism from parts of the secessionist camp who pointed to other outlets willing to take the risk.\n\nIn a key move, Spain's Constitutional Court imposed daily fines of between \u20ac6,000 and \u20ac12,000 on two members of the Catalan Cabinet on the charge of organizing the referendum and the 22 members of the ad-hoc electoral body created to supervise the vote and proclaim the official results.\n\nIn response, the Catalan government dissolved the electoral body and dismissed one of the two Cabinet officials. That some officials calling for Catalans to flout the law were so quickly willing to back down did not sit well with some supporters of independence.\n\nSpain's heavy hand has left millions of Catalans furious at what Puigdemont has described as a \"totalitarian\" crackdown.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain's Court of Auditors has demanded that the organizers of an informal independence vote in 2014 repay the state for the expenses incurred. The order shook up the ranks of the separatists this summer. Five members of the Catalan Cabinet were replaced, one of whom had said he was willing to risk prison but not his assets.\n\nOn Tuesday, former Catalan leader Artur Mas -- who's been ordered by the Court to post a bail of more than \u20ac5 million -- asked people in a radio interview to make private contributions to a solidarity account, arguing that those who lead the effort should not be asked to bear \"such a high price.\" Pro-independence organizations have reportedly collected more than \u20ac2 million so far.\n\nSpain's heavy hand has left millions of Catalans furious at what Puigdemont has described as a \"totalitarian\" crackdown. Most observers expect massive protests if Catalans are prevented from voting, and there's little certainty what will happen in the effort's aftermath -- whether Puigdemont or the regional chamber will declare unilateral independence.\n\nDivisions have started to form among the separatists -- which include political parties from the center right to the anti-capitalist left -- over whether the region should unilaterally secede if the referendum passes, as called for under the law the Constitutional Court has suspended while it prepares a definitive ruling.\n\nIn an interview broadcast Sunday, Puigdemont said a unilateral declaration of independence was a possibility even if voting proved impossible -- though he added that it was not his preferred option.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of Puigdemont's fellow lawmakers, Carles Campuzano, \"absolutely ruled out\" a declaration of independence -- no matter the outcome of the vote -- prompting outrage across the separatist political spectrum.\n\nJoan Tard\u00e0, of the Catalan Republican Left, responded in a tweet that \"the first and last word\" on independence belongs to the Catalan chamber and the regional government.\n\nSpain is doing everything it can to prevent that from being the case.", "In its roughly 30th installment of \"Red Century,\" a weekly series of op-eds dedicated to the notion that 20th century communism wasn't all that bad, the New York Times performed a bit of perhaps inadvertent recycling.\n\nOn Monday, Helen Gao, in an item the Times appears to have had the good sense to keep out of its print edition, argued, with \"crucial caveats\" (but not enough of them) that \"the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big.\" Times columnist Nicholas Kristof infamously said much the same thing in 2005.\n\nKristof was reviewing a just-released book, Mao: The Unknown Story, which, based on a decade of research, placed the death toll under Chinese dictator Mao Ze Dong at \"well over 70 million.\"\n\nYet there he was, even after admitting that the book \"demolishes every pillar of Mao's claim to sympathy or legitimacy,\" quibbling over the authors' body count and defending, or at least excusing, Mao's legacy (bolds are mine throughout this post):\n\n... I have reservations about the book's judgments, for my own sense is that Mao, however monstrous, also brought useful changes to China. And at times the authors seem so eager to destroy him that I wonder if they exclude exculpatory evidence.\n\n... In Moscow, he offered to sacrifice the lives of 300 million Chinese, half the population at the time, and in 1958 he blithely declared of the overworked population: \"Working like this, with all these projects, half of China may well have to die.\"\n\nAt times, Mao seems nuts.\n\n... Finally, there is Mao's place in history. I agree that Mao was a catastrophic ruler in many, many respects, and this book captures that side better than anything ever written. But Mao's legacy is not all bad. Land reform in China, like the land reform in Japan and Taiwan, helped lay the groundwork for prosperity today. The emancipation of women and end of child marriages moved China from one of the worst places in the world to be a girl to one where women have more equality than in, say, Japan or Korea. Indeed, Mao's entire assault on the old economic and social structure made it easier for China to emerge as the world's new economic dragon.\n\nAh yes, the \"emancipation of women.\" That's where Monday's op-ed by Gao, \"a social policy analyst at a research company,\" takes over:\n\nHow Did Women Fare in China's Communist Revolution?\n\n... \"The Communists did many terrible things,\" my grandmother always says at the end of her reminiscences. \"But they made women's lives much better.\"\n\nThat often-repeated dictum sums up the popular perception of Mao Zedong's legacy regarding women in China. As every Chinese schoolchild learns in history class, the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories, liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy and imperialist threat.\n\nBut the narrative of an across-the-board elevation of women's status under Mao contains crucial caveats.\n\nWhile the Communist revolution brought women more job opportunities, it also made their interests subordinate to collective goals.\n\nThat's how it always is, Helen. That is the essence of communism; do what you're told, and tell everyone you're happy -- or else.\n\nWhat's really offensive is how each author handled Mao's \"Great Leap Forward\" of 1958-1961. In unexcerpted text, Kristof's 2005 book review spent 140 tedious words questioning the authors' estimate that 38 million people died. Gosh, he said, other estimates say it was \"only\" 30 million, or even 23 million. Well Nick, in 2010, Frank Dik\u00f6tter, a Hong Kong-based historian who at the time was \"the only author to have delved into the Chinese archives since they were reopened\" in 2006, reported the following, as carried in the UK Independent:\n\nAt least 45 million people were worked, starved or beaten to death in China over these four years; the worldwide death toll of the Second World War was 55 million.\n\nSo the body count claimed by the authors of Mao: The Unknown Story turns out to have really been a mid-point.\n\nGao basically acts as if the Great Leap Forward never happened (the term never appears), and instead guardedly praises \"collectivization\":\n\nWhen historians researched the collectivization of the Chinese countryside in the 1950s, an event believed to have empowered rural women by offering them employment, they discovered a complicated picture. While women indeed contributed enormously to collective farming, they rarely rose to positions of responsibility; they remained outsiders in communes organized around their husbands' family and village relationships. Studies also showed that women routinely performed physically demanding jobs but earned less than men, since the lighter, most valued tasks involving large animals or machinery were usually reserved for men.\n\nThe only really \"complicated\" thing here, as discussed already, is getting one's arms around an accurate death toll.\n\nBoth Kristof in 2005 and Gao in 2017 had nothing to say about the disproportionate number of pre-born baby girls killed in the womb as a result of China's one-child policy. That policy went into effect in 1979, three years after Mao's death, and was only slightly loosened to become a two-child policy effective in 2016. An item seen that year at Time.com, of all places, reported that:\n\nOne international population journal dubbed the one-child policy even more devastating to China than the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution or a manmade famine that killed millions from 1959-1961.\n\nSo if one properly blames China's one-child policy on totalitarian communism, the death toll in that country easily tops 100 million. \"Red (with victims' blood) Century\" indeed.\n\nFinally, both Kristof and Gao act as if China's totalitarian policies were necessary evils which resulted in that nation becoming an economic power. That's utter nonsense. In fact, Gao, after describing how \"emancipated\" women really weren't all that emancipated for several paragraphs, wraps up her piece by writing:\n\nFor all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big. When it came to advice for my mother, my grandmother applauded her daughter's decision to go to graduate school and urged her to find a husband who would be supportive of her career. She still seems to think that the new market economy -- with its meritocracy and freedom of choice -- will finally allow women to be masters of their minds and actions.\n\nAfter all, she has always said to my mother, \"you have more opportunities.\"\n\nThe country's partial adoption of a \"market economy,\" aka capitalism -- all of which occurred after Mao's death -- is why those \"opportunities\" exist. (Deng Tsaio Peng, not Mao, was the country's economic architect.) The problem is still that the Chinese surveillance state (with disgraceful technical assistance from US tech companies going back to 2005) can still take them all away, individually or collectively, in the blink of an eye.\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nThe one good thing we can say about the \"Red Century\" series at the New York Times is that there has perhaps never been a more comprehensive collection of useful idiocy all in one place.", "The Republican Party is no stranger to extreme candidates. It has lost eminently winnable Senate races by picking unelectable nominees like Todd Akin, Sharron Angle, Richard Mourdock and Christine O'Donnell in recent years.

While other candidates have said controversial things, none was a true-believer on par with Moore. This is a candidate who:\n\n* was removed from the state Supreme Court for refusing to obey binding rulings -- twice -- including most recently for refusing to obey the federal legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\n* fomented the President Barack Obama birth conspiracy theory (which, unlike President Donald Trump, he still hasn't renounced).\n\n* suggested Obama is a secret Muslim in a video released by his foundation.\n\n* said homosexuality should be illegal (but clarified that he doesn't think gays should be killed).\n\n* said as recently as this week that certain parts of the U.S. are under sharia law.\n\n* called Islam a \"false religion.\"\n\n* said Muslim Rep. Keith Ellison, R-Minn., shouldn't be allowed in Congress.\n\n* suggested 9/11 was punishment for godlessness in the U.S., and said the same of shootings and killings.\n\n* denied custody of three children to a woman in a lesbian relationship, calling her lifestyle \"an inherent evil.\".\n\nNow, after defeating Luther Strange, who had President Donald Trump's vocal backing, in the Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, Moore is most likely going to Washington. That prospect has stunned many people beyond Alabama, including some of the nation's top Republicans.\n\nService in the Senate presents sweeping challenges, and the Capitol Hill establishment is not likely to roll out a welcome mat for Moore. He said throughout the campaign that he would be a gadfly, not an obedient follower of the party line laid down by Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, whose allies spent heavily in Alabama trying to help Strange keep his seat.\n\n\"McConnell and all of those people in Washington know I'm not to be controlled,\" said Moore, whose campaign won the support of Stephen Bannon, Trump's onetime chief strategist. \"I'm not going to be managed, I've never been.\"\n\nYet observers of the man whom many know simply as Judge Moore sometimes struggle for a neat, overarching description of his approach to public policy, beyond simple populism. In his years on the bench, he stayed at something of a remove from the pro-business orthodoxy of the Republicans who have won near-absolute power in Alabama in recent years, and for an array of reasons, business leaders have kept their distance from him.\n\n\"He is a populist,\" said Jim Zeigler, a Republican who is the state auditor. \"I don't think he intends to be.

They've since fled to London to continue their work as refugees, but even in exile, they're still at it: \"The thing that united us was the protest against censorship in Belarus,\" BFT co-creator and director Vladimir Shcherban said in a recent interview. \"In Britain, it's the protest against the dictatorship of money.\"\n\nBurning Doors, which counts Pussy Riot's Maria Alyokhina among its ensemble and which runs this weekend only at On the Boards, isn't self-serious pain tourism or an ~exploration of the liminal spaces between~ jack shit. It's a brief history of three soviet dissidents that looks like a street brawl in a torture chamber, but it's also a show full of humor and life and embodied arguments about the struggle for freedom under totalitarian regimes.\n\nThe first half serves as a primer on dissident activity in Russia and Ukraine during the first few years of the 2010s. With paragraphs from Dostoyevsky and Foucault laced in-between, performers described and at times act out the arrest, imprisonment, and torture of members Pussy Riot (the punk rock group who was imprisoned in 2012 for playing a show in Cathedral of Christ the Savior), Petr Pavlensky (who is famous for nailing his balls to the cobblestones of Red Square and for setting the doors of a Russia's secret-police headquarters on fire, hence this piece's title) and Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker who's currently serving a 20-year term for suspicion of committing terrorism.\n\nIn a series of rapid-fire scenes, BFT used repetition both of language and of movement to show how those in power normalize submission. \"In prison they don't teach you to follow the rules, but not to break them,\" Alyokhina said at one point. At one point, they rolled a bathtub onto the stage. One of the men (Haradnitski) begins to dunk Alyokhina's head beneath the water. He does it over and over again until eventually she dunks her own head beneath the water and holds it there for a disturbingly long time. Later on, one actor tackles another actor -- again and again -- until eventually the guy getting tackled uses the attacker's own weight to fling him off.

The votes for each candidate were announced in ascending order and the cheering in the hall began when Waters was named as the runner-up with 21 per cent of the vote, compared to Bolton's 29 per cent.\n\nIn a press conference later, the new leader left no doubt that Ukip's choice was not only an endorsement of him but a rejection of Waters's campaign against Islam.\n\n\"There is an issue to be discussed and we need to do that in partnership with the Muslim community of Britain. We don't need to be confronting anyone, I absolutely abhor the rhetoric that says we are at war with Islam or anything that indicates as such,\" he said.\n\nBolton said it was for Waters to decide if she wished to remain in Ukip but he agreed that, by not electing her, it had avoided becoming the \"UK Nazi party\".\n\n\"Absolutely, I think the party has today voted for a leader who has been very open about what he feels is the way forward,\" he said.\n\nOutside, the vanquished warrior was nowhere to be seen but among the relieved delegates were a few who felt let down. Cathy Carey, who had the words \"Patriotism is not Racism\" emblazoned on her T-shirt, thought Ukip had missed an opportunity.\n\n\"I think she's prepared to expose a lot more of the corrupted truth. Islam is a major, major thing. But it's not just Islam, it's the Left, the totalitarian fascist regime that they have become in our country, what Europe has become - it's a fascist regime. And the Nazism that Islam is is staring us in the face,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm sick of being called a racist and a Nazi. They are the Nazis. They're here to conquer. They are invading by mass immigration.\"\n\nLiz Phillips said she never believed that Ukip members would choose Waters and she felt certain that Bolton was the right choice.\n\n\"I've known Henry Bolton for a long time and he really is a leader of men and he will lead this party. He will unite the party,\" she said.\n\nIan Walsh thought Ukip had dodged a bullet in rejecting Waters, arguing that, after Theresa May's speech in Florence last week, the party should focus on holding her to account over Brexit. \"Up until she made that speech, I believed she would do the right thing. Now I believe that it's Ukip's job to make sure that she does do the right thing.\"", "The US is the primary 'boogeyman' in North Korean propaganda.

Kim Jong Un needs the US to act like it's enemy, so it is quite likely that the ongoing bellicose rhetoric will escalate even further\n\nThe escalation in the war of words between the United States and North Korea reached a new pinnacle this past week. The most recent addition in the verbal hostilities came from North Korean Foreign Minister (FM) Ri Yong Ho, who stated that it was inevitable that North Korea would launch a missile at US mainland. The statement was issued at a speech at the UN general assembly, a platform which was used days earlier by US President Donald Trump. Trump had threatened North Korea with total destruction if it didn't cease it's defiance of the United States and it's allies.\n\nThe US is the primary 'boogeyman' in North Korean propaganda. Totalitarian regimes need an arch-enemy to fit their nationalistic narrative around and against which the population can be united. Kim Jong Un needs the US to act like it's enemy, so it is quite likely that the ongoing bellicose rhetoric will escalate even further. Trump has already sent US bombers to fly in international waters along the North Korean coast in a provocative display of American military power. Undeterred, the North Korean regime threatened to shoot down the bombers even if they didn't enter American airspace.Trump has also belittled Kim Jong Un as a 'Rocket Man', to which Kim responded by referring to Trump as a 'dotard'. As of now, there seem to be more insults than bombs involved.\n\nAccording to experts the roots of this current standoff can be found in the 'stability-instability paradox', according to which nuclear weapons deter war, as was witnessed during the cold war. At the same time, threats of war and other provocativebehaviour go up. This is why Kim thinks he can get away with threatening history's greatest military juggernaut with nuclear annihilation.\n\nKim also knows that as long as he is being backed by China, he can keep upping the ante. Both China and Russia haven't displayed any sign of worry regarding the nuclear threats, with Japan on the other end on the spectrum. Russia has even spoken against unilateral US action, insisting that dialogue is the only way forward. Additionally, Putin has refused to cease Russia's oil exports to North Korea. Beijing is more open to using sanctions to reign in North Korea. The Japanese are planning remilitarization, and it's defence ministry is intent on acquiring land-based Aegis Ashore defence systems.\n\nAccording to experts, the roots of this current standoff can be found in the 'stability-instability paradox', according to which nuclear weapons deter war, as was witnessed during the Cold War.

If this happens, the ensuing destruction would be, in Trump's words 'unimaginable'.\n\nThe major players need to play their role to prevent that situation from arising. Neither very hard, nor very soft approaches will work here. There is a need to be prudent and pragmatic. The Chinese have suggested that the US cease joint military exercises with South Korea, in exchange for North Korea agreeing to not carry out more missile tests.\n\nIt has also been standard practice to ignore the North Korean regime's repression and cruelty towards it's citizens. This has been ongoing since long before nuclear weapons and ICBM's from North Korea became a believable threat. This is ironic since North Korean's are suffering under one of the most repressive regimes in the world, which alone justifies isolating or forcing change in the country. It is ironic that those who claim to be champions of human rights remained quiet regarding thebarbarities in North Korea right until it became capable of threatening their strategic interests.", "Antifa extremists attack a Trump supporter at Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Berkeley, California, on Aug. 27, 2017. (Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)\n\nA new documentary exposes the far-left, extremist group Antifa, and its ties to communist revolutionary groups in the United States. It shows that the group of black-clad, masked protesters known for using violence and intimidation to silence conservatives may have an agendapushed from behind the scenes.\n\nThe 37-minute documentary, \"America Under Siege: Antifa,\" was released on Sept. 25 by the Capital Research Center and Cohesion Films. According to conservative author and the film's writer, Trevor Loudon, the mainstream media has largely framed Antifa as a group of kids burning off steam, but with a bit of research, \"we knew that wasn't the case.\"\n\nAntifa promotes a blend of anarchy and communism, and was formed in 1920s Germany as the violence and intimidation wing of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).\n\nIn a previous report, The Epoch Times exposed its origins, noting that Antifa, then known as Antifaschistische Aktion (\"Antifascist Action\"), was created under the direct guidance of the Russian Soviet regime -- a brutal dictatorship that, according to \"The Black Book of Communism,\" would eventually kill more than 20 million people.\n\nLoudon said he and his fellow researchers sought to find out whether Antifa still maintained Communist Party links. They not only found this to be true, but also found that mainstream political ties have given a free pass to Antifa's violence.\n\nIn the group's recent, violent clashes in Berkeley, Charlottesville, and Oakland, the local police present at the incidents were allegedly told to stand down. In Charlottesville the police even led right-wing protesters through the mob of Antifa protesters where violence then took place.\n\n\"We found that Antia violence was most prevalent in cities controlled by Democratic city councils, in which the police were under the control of the councils,\" Loudon said.\n\nHe said that in Berkeley, Antifa is affiliated with the far-left extremist group By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), and several senior Berkeley poltical figures -- including Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin -- are members of the BAMN Facebook group.\n\nBAMN, Loudon notes, was an outgrowth of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Workers League.\n\nAntifa's ties to communist and extremist groups vary depending on where it operates. Loudon said in Orlando, Antifa is very close to the Democratic Socialists of America. The Texas branch of Antifa is tied to the local Red Guard, a Maoist organization. Another Antifa branch, Refuse Fascism, is a front for the Revolutionary Communist Party.\n\nOne of the main endorsers of Refuse Fascism, Loudon reports, is Bill Ayers, a former leader of the Weather Underground, a communist organization that carried out terrorist attacks in the United States in the 1970s. Had the organization succeeded in its communist revolution, it infamously planned to kill 25 million Americans.\n\n\"Antifa today is like a franchise,\" Loudon said, adding that \"in many instances\" it also has close ties to the Democratic Party.\n\nAntifa has garnered some mainstream support since it claims to oppose fascism, and claims its violence is a means to suppress fascism. Yet, as Loudon notes, in terms of its actions and its beliefs, \"Antifa is pretty much the most active fascist group in America right now.\"\n\nHe compared Antifa with Adolph Hitler's brown shirts, which likewise used violence to attack and intimidate enemies of Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' (Nazi) party. Both sides, he said, \"believe in shutting down free speech, believe in forcing others to accept their will.\"\n\nBoth Antifa and the Nazi Brown Shirts, he added, are little more than \"street gangs\" promoting totalitarian systems.\n\nLoudon noted that even historically, when the Nazis won in Germany, many former members of the communist KPD, which started Antifa, became members of Hitler's Brown Shirts.\n\n\"There was one internal report from the Brown Shirts that 55 percent of the Brown Shirt ranks were former German Communists,\" he said. \"They called them beefsteak Nazis, brown on the outside red in the middle.\"", "Asia News Network commentators slam attempts to misuse religion in the region\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale bagged this year's Emmy award for outstanding drama series. The story takes place some time in the future, when birth rates are at rock bottom and the human species is battling a survival crisis.\n\nThe enraged male-dominated leadership blames it on women who are unwilling or unable to conceive. Some of the extremists plan to overthrow the United States government and replace it with the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state which overturns the virtues of democracy and freedom. Gilead is ruled by male clerics who vow to build a wholly sanctified nation through the purging of human souls.\n\nAll women, except the clerics' wives, are stripped of their citizens' rights and their assets are forfeited. They are forced to stop working and learning. All they are allowed to do is bear children. Anyone running against the law is put to death.\n\nAlthough the story happens in the future, it is, in its essence, about emerging conservatism and extremism in today's world as human civilisation recedes to the amorphous formlessness of the age of religious theocracy millennia ago. While the story sounds surreal and wildly imaginative, it nevertheless reflects what is taking place right under our noses.\n\nIn our world today, many have tried to enforce their perceived \"sanctity\" on other people, in the name of religious \"sanctity\". From the caliphate fantasy of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group and the Muslims-only launderette in Muar, to the dress code for non-Muslims (later said to be for Africans only) at the Flora Damansara (condominium).\n\nThese absurdities, all in the guise of religion, are nothing short of extremism. I'm not the only one to brand such acts \"extremist\", for many educated men in Malay society have done likewise. The Johor Sultan's second son wrote of the \"halal\" launderette in Muar: \"I was shocked. It's too extreme!\"\n\nCIMB chairman Nazir Razak lamented: \"Such acts of extremism must be stopped. They have distorted Islamic teachings.\"\n\nUnfortunately, many other Muslims appear to endorse such aberrations. Johor mufti Mohd Tahrir Samsudin said cleanliness is very important to Muslims and that the laundry only wants to make sure its washing machines are not soiled by unclean things.Sadly, such discourses have a large following in the conservative Malay society.\n\nFew decent-minded people, Buddhist or otherwise, would have been perturbed last week when outspoken monk Phra Apichart Paunnajanto, known for railing against Islam, was disrobed.\n\nHis immediate disappearance from public view was cause for speculation for several days, but then he resurfaced, clad in pious white attire, insisting he was a changed man. It was his decision alone to leave the monkhood, he said. He hadn't been forcibly disrobed at all, let alone by the state and ecclesiastical authorities.\n\nThose authorities also said he had voluntarily shed his saffron robes, but we have our suspicions.\n\nThis is the man who despicably called on Buddhists to burn down a mosque every time a monk was killed in the conflict-riddled south, not an infrequent occurrence there. Such vengeful, prejudicial, inflammatory preaching not only contradicted the teachings of the Lord Buddha, but it also ran counter to common human decency.\n\nApichart seems, though, to have undergone a conversion in his brief absence from public view. He no longer advocates violence against Muslims, no longer feels they are a threat to Thai Buddhism.\n\nHow did this abrupt change of mind come about? Perhaps the ruling junta's almost magical abilities at \"attitude adjustment\" had something to do with it.\n\nGovernment officials would like us to think Apichart was a \"lone wolf\" - a deluded monk with wayward sermons. But several Buddhist academics have looked deeper into the matter and concluded that's not the case.\n\nThey have suggested that prominent political figures and monks in Thailand were elevating Apichart as this country's version of Wirathu, the nationalist monk in Myanmar ferociously attacking the Muslim minority there. Wirathu's fiery anti-Islam rhetoric paved the way for the persecution of Muslims and the slaughter of the Rohingya in particular. Photographs taken in Apichart's residential hall show portraits of Wirathu on the wall. The Thai clearly is (or was) an admirer.\n\nApichart's call for Thai Buddhists to burn down a mosque for every monk killed by southern insurgents made headlines two years ago.\n\nHe was arrested a week ago, reportedly over controversial videos he recently posted online. It seemed an odd turn of events for Apichart if what the scholars have found is true - that he was in some ways a creation of the ultra-conservative elements in Thai society.\n\nApichart's monk's robes may have been removed and his Facebook account shuttered, but the atmosphere in Thailand remains polluted with the cruel beliefs and vengeful hatred he formerly espoused. The authorities and society as a whole will have to do much more than silence the voice of one man who probably ended up going too far. Any monk can be disrobed.\n\nDating services help lonely hearts worldwide but an online service offering convenient partners for nikah siri (unregistered marriages) has whipped up a storm.\n\nThe website, which also reportedly planned a \"virginity auction\", was promptly closed by the Communications and Information Ministry.\n\nThe owner of the nikahsirri.com website, a businessman named Aris Wahyudi, was arrested.\n\nAn angry Social Affairs Minister, Khofifah Indar Parawansa, has warned the public against the business platform's attempts to profit from legalising adultery and making a commodity out of nikah siri, which cannot guarantee the rights of wives and their children.\n\nNevertheless, thousands had registered on the website, reflecting widespread interest in nikah siri, literally discreet marriages, which are common in Indonesia.\n\nSuch marriages involve far less hassle - mainly in acquiring the permission of the first wife, in the case of legal polygamous unions.\n\nAris is accused of violating the Pornography Law and the Electronic Information and Transactions Law, but his website is only one of several, and similar online services were first reported several years ago.", "When Australian Ballet director David McAllister was growing up in suburban Perth, there weren't a whole heap of boys learning classical dance. \"My poor father lived through the whole drama of having this crazy boy who wanted to be a ballet dancer,\" he says. \"He was very supportive when I look back on it but he used to pick me up from ballet every week and go 'you know you don't have to go back next week if you don't want to...' and I'd go 'no Dad, it's really great, I really want to go'.\"\n\nThis was the early 1970s. Elsewhere in the world Rudolf Nureyev was redefining the image of the male ballet dancer, but Australia was late to the party. Mr McAllister senior's trepidation was more a symptom of the lingering cultural resistance to men in tights. \"He was very wonderful in the way that he didn't want to stop me but I think he probably would have liked it if I had stopped. Not now, he's very proud.\"\n\nToday's Australia sees innumerable boys signing up for ballet school, says McAllister, \"because I think parents of today are much less worried about gender stereotypes. Girls playing with trucks and boys doing ballet is not something that gets frowned upon.\" Aside from the occasional embarrassing spectacle of \"footballers doing the four swans from Swan Lake in really bad tutus\", anyone who's ever seen an Australian Ballet dancer in action will instantly recognise the elite level of physical discipline their art requires. The other day a group of Collingwood players were at the AB working with one of the company's strength coaches, and watching a class left them \"taken aback at the physicality that the guys need to do what they do\", says McAllister.\n\nBut while men in ballet are now as accomplished as their female counterparts, it wasn't always that way. \"When I joined the company if you had two legs you pretty much got a job,\" says McAllister. \"When I first started dancing, the public thought of male dancers as wearing powdered wigs and being a bit limp. That they were very much standing behind the woman and often a bit pink.\"\n\nUntil the 20th century, the men in ballet were less like celebrities and more like something you'd hire from Bunnings - mechanical functionaries to help women fly higher, extending their lines and lengthening their leaps.\n\nAustralian Ballet principal Kevin Jackson says that for much of the artform's history, the job of a man was \"mainly about supporting the women. Basically all of the big classical ballets are based on the female being the lead role and the Prince is sort of just there to kiss her or save the day. He's not the main plotline of the story, so to be in full focus in ballets like Spartacus is really cool.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's speaking of the Australian Ballet's new production of Spartacus, premiering in 2018. It's a welcome work not merely as a new ballet in its own right, but as one that addresses the shortfall in really meaty roles for ballet blokes. The roles ballerinas dream of a shot at are countless: Giselle, Odille, Aurora. You can almost list the great parts for men on one foot. There's Swan Lake's Siegfried, Giselle's Albrecht, what's-his-name in Manon. For most of ballet's history, the (sugar) plum jobs have been women's. Men have been cast as support. Literally.\n\n\"It's a great drawcard for our very staunch female audience to see the men up the front wearing very little and looking fantastic,\" says McAllister, \"but I think it's also as positive an experience for the male members of the audience that they can see something that's much more physical and athletic and based in that struggle for the men.\"\n\nMcAllister traces the great revolution in male ballet back to Nureyev's defection from Russia to the West in 1961. \"There was a whole generation of male dancers that basically just walked out of the theatre because he changed the perception of what male dancing was,\" says McAllister. \"Instead of wearing heeled shoes and powdered wigs they were meant to be strong, powerful, charismatic, dynamic, sexy, all these things that drew a whole new audience to ballet.\"\n\nNureyev and fellow Soviet defector Mikhail Baryshnikov made the male dancer less of a function and more of a feature. With them came new ideals of what masculinity on stage could be: \"the females have always had that aesthetic of the ballerina, frail, fragile but with steely strength, whereas now the men are much more muscular, they have to dance as effortlessly as the women but still doing the big, huge aerial jumps and turns and the big dynamic partnering,\" says McAllister.\n\nIn the last few decades, says Jackson, the requirements for men in ballet \"have exceeded anyone's expectations. We're expected not only to jump, do massive tricks, do multiple turns, but then be a good partner, strong, be able to act and support the females.\"\n\nThe men of the Australian Ballet must be Olympic-level athletes today, and the expectations placed on them extend beyond the physical. \"We have to be very strong-willed and have a lot of determination and inner strength to get through the workload that is expected of us,\" says Jackson. \"And there's also an expectation for you to become a leader of the company. As principal men or senior dancers of the company we have to lead the way and teach the younger dancers how to be.\"\n\nChoreographer Lucas Jervies agrees that the ballet man is more than just a top-tier athlete, but has to cultivate \"consideration of your partner, how you share the stage with that person. It's about responding to your colleagues, about being generous with your port de bras, that's the movement of the arms. It's about taking flight, jumping with ease, being humble, being self-assured. It's all of those things. I don't think it's about brute strength.\"\n\nJervies is the choreographer of next year's Spartacus for the Australian Ballet. The company already has a Spartacus in its repertoire, but it hasn't been performed by the company since 2002. It was the last show Jervies performed in before leaving the company as a dancer, and Jackson was still a student when he appeared in it as an extra. \"Some ballets are very much of a period and then you bring them back and they start showing their age a little,\" says McAllister.\n\nJust as the broader social notions of masculinity continue to shift, Jervies is firm in his desire to make a new Spartacus that reflects our age. \"It's not an opportunity to revisit old-fashioned masculinity.\"\n\nThe story is still that of the Thracian king enslaved by the Romans who stirs up a revolt among his fellow captives, but Jervies has scoured the literature to create a figure who is more than an action-hero fantasy. Some of the writings he has found describe Spartacus \"almost as a Buddha or a Jesus-type figure where the other slaves call him 'father' and they look to him for advice and comfort. In some of the Roman historians' writings they talk about him in a similar way, that he was educated and smart. He was strategic and patient. I'd really like to tap into those qualities if I can.\"\n\nFor both Jervies and Jackson, the roles such as Spartacus are less interesting for the feats of physical virtuosity they afford male dancers than they are for the increased depth of emotion and character. Jackson played the title role in last year's Nijinsky: \"The biggest thing about Nijinsky was that it was about a real person. Someone that you could connect with through dance.\" Spanning the years from the iconic male dancer's heights of international fame to the mental breakdown he suffered after his career ended, the production gave Jackson the opportunity to explore mental illness through ballet. It's a long way from fairytale princes.\n\nJervies is looking to accomplish something similarly relevant with his Spartacus. He's still setting it in Rome, but \"it's really important for me to research and understand the current climate. Modern day slavery and what that actually means. To look at slavery in regimes over the last hundred years, even further back to the American and South American slave trade.\"\n\nJervies was recently in a cafe listening to the score to Aram Khachaturian's Spartacus ballet of 1954. The venue was quiet enough that its rousing percussion, brassy flourish and heavy bass notes could be heard by the barista, who leaned out and yelled \"is that Star Wars?\"\n\nJervies will be using Khachaturian's score for his production, but is as attentive to the work's politics as its theatrical bombast. \"Khachaturian was denounced by the Communist Party in 1947 for creating music that was too difficult for the masses. He was exiled and nearly killed. I guess you can see writing Spartacus as somewhat of a political act. I think Rome is Stalin's Russia, it's Hitler's Germany, it's a totalitarian state where the individual is a subject of state control. Where stepping out of line gets you killed. Just talking about that makes me think of North Korea, of Mauritania in North Africa, of China to some extent. I'm finding different representations of those situations and societies and trying to find a way to distil those and inject them into our production in a supportive way.\"\n\nIt's hard to reconcile themes of modern slavery and oppressive regimes with ballet's dictum to make things beautiful. \"Ballet's inherently beautiful,\" Jervies concedes. \"You can't ignore that. Spartacus is about breaking free and standing up against the state but it's also about love.\" He cites Auschwitz survivor Victor Frankl's thoughts on suffering as offering a way of bringing together the darker themes he's exploring with ballet's romanticism: \"he talks about love being everything. Without love he could not have gotten through (the Holocaust). It was dreaming of love and the fact of being in love that saved his soul. So in my production when Spartacus meets Flavia, the love interest, it's a catalyst for him to change, to be a better man, to not put up with the status quo. It's for that reason that he breaks free, and that quest for love is really the driving force for the whole production. That creates a great space to put both beauty and terror side by side.\"\n\nWhile Spartacus illustrates how far male dancers have come from the days of those powdered wigs and heeled shoes, it's not as if men have been absent from ballet's history - quite the opposite. \"Men created ballet on women,\" says Jervies, \"when gender roles were very specific, shall we say. Oppressive. There are still traces of that left behind in the art form. There's still work to be done.\"\n\nBut for all of the legacy left by Nureyev, Nijinsky and Baryshnikov, Jervies says that the real advances that benefit male dancers in today's ballet were made by women. \"What I think is really cool is that women actually created modern dance. It's the bravery and the wisdom of these female pioneers that has returned or seeped back into ballet and educated and expanded and kind of crafted the roles of both sexes in ballet today.\"\n\nSpartacus is part of the Australian Ballet's 2018 program. australianballet.com.au", "What happens when police use social media to solve crimes?

This clears the way for TV to move ahead and attack the taboo on mention of the even more fearful omphalophobia.\n\nThe FCC public service requirements for this review thus satisfied, we can get about discussing the shows, which range from Ten Days in the Valley, one of the new season's better ones (much less of an achievement than you might think), to Wisdom of the Crowd, which will probably win an Emmy for sheer idiocy for its idee fixe of contracting out the criminal justice system to Twitter.\n\nTen Days in the Valley is not, on the face of it, terribly different than the crime-conspiracy thrillers like Secrets and Lies and American Crime that ABC has been using as fun and forgettable summertime popcorn fodder the past few years. A pretty girl or maybe even a little kid gets murdered; everybody in the cast is revealed to be a creep or nut case with the motive -- but not, it eventually turns out, the means -- to do the killing; and in the end, the least likely suspect is the guilty one.\n\nThe trigger mechanism in the case of Ten Days is the kidnapping of the little daughter of frazzled single mom Jane Sadler, a TV producer whose bosses think nothing of calling her up in the middle of the night to churn 30 pages of new scenes by the time of a 4 a.m. shooting call.\n\nSticking to the formula, Sadler's producer, sister, drug dealer, ex-husband, personal assistant, and gardener all turn out to hate her for one reason or another. And why not? She's a heedless hophead who, it turns out, lost track of her daughter while on an Ambien-and-chardonnay bender.\n\nEven the seemingly decent LAPD detective John Bird assigned to the kidnapping has to be considered a suspect (by the viewer if not the authorities) because the TV show for which she writes is a sleazy roman-a-clef drawn from secret scandals within the police force, which has everybody in the department worried that he or she will be the next to be fingered.\n\nThat's the little twist of Ten Days -- that the narrator is not only unreliable but actively detestable. If that seems like an unpromising premise for a TV series, you've got to see the intensity of Kyra Sedgwick as Jane Sadler, juggling ignominy, scandal, and disaster -- not to mention the life of her missing daughter -- as she tap-dances along the edge of an abyss, wondering if she's already toppled over the side and doesn't know it.\n\nIf Ten Days seems familiar but intense, Ghosted seems about 15 years too late. A wacky sitcom in which two investigators, one a cynical skeptic and the other a true believer, pursue space aliens and psychic phenomena? What's next? A searing social satire in which in-bred Appalachian moonshiners move to Bel Air and mock the Beverly Hills elite?\n\nActually, Ghosted isn't all that bad, even if satirizing The X-Files feels a little bit wet-noodley at this point. Adam Scott (Parks and Recreation) and Craig Robinson (Mr. Robinson) play a couple of lunkheads who've been recruited to help a secret government agency called the Bureau Underground look into weird doings around Los Angeles.\n\nScott is a former Stanford professor sacked for research into the paranormal. (Or, \"fired space cadet,\" as the tabloids deliciously put it.) More recently, he's been trying to convince people his wife has been abducted by space aliens, though she was last seen packing her bags after a vicious marital spat.\n\nRobinson, once the top LAPD missing-persons guy, was fired for reasons that remain unclear but may be connected to his moonstruck fear of ducks. (\"Don't wanna talk about it.\") Lately he's a mall rent-a-cop who specializes in keeping homeless people from peeing in the fountain.\n\nThe two share a certain lunatic energy, with a cascade of pratfalls being punctuated by arguments about stuff like which alternative universe has the best Kevin Spacey. There are more misses than hits, but in a new season mostly devoid of (intentional) laughs, this is about the best you're gonna do.\n\nFor unintentional laughs, mixed with gasps of horror, give CBS' Wisdom of the Crowd a look.

Perhaps it is time for this to become a regular Power Line feature.\n\nCase in point is the story today of the Cambridge librarian who has refused a donation of Dr. Seuss books from Melania Trump because Dr. Seuss is -- wait for it -- a racist!\n\nA librarian at Cambridgeport School refused to accept the gift, criticizing Trump administration education policies and images in the books. Seuss's illustrations are \"steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes,\" librarian Liz Phipps Soeiro wrote in a letter to Trump on Tuesday.\n\nOh-kay. I guess Soeiro is unfamiliar with -- or doesn't know how to perceive -- some of Seuss's older works such as:\n\nAs usual, David Burge (aka, \"Iowahawk\") has the best takedown of this madness:\n\nIt is clear from his work that Awdry [Thomas's creator] disliked change, venerated order, and craved the administration of punishment. . . But on the Island of Sodor steam locomotives are permanently on top. The caste system is very rigid. There is one diesel engine, a black train known just as \"Diesel,\" who struggles to prove that he's as useful as the steam trains. . .\n\nOn Sodor, the steam trains engage in constant competition for big jobs, more work, and the Fat Controller's approval. Anthropomorphized trains in literature tend to be hard workers, but one Tumblr thread holds that Thomas and friends have other motivations. The show \"canonically takes place in a train post-apocalypse where the Island of Sodor is the only safe zone in a totalitarian dystopia in which steam trains are routinely killed and their body parts are sold or cannibalized for repair,\" a Tumblr user named frog-and-toad-are-friends argues. . .\n\nThis is what happens when \"critical theory\" gets taken seriously.\n\nI still like this perspective on the Thomas world:\n\nReminder from Arthur Schlesinger: \"Ignorance is never any bar to certitude in the progressive dreamworld.\"", "Just two or three generations ago, most Americans understood that George Orwell's classics Animal Farm and 1984 were written to explain how freedom is lost to totalitarianism and the intolerance that accompanies it. \"Big Brother,\" a term still casually used to describe an all-knowing governing authority, comes right out of 1984. In the society that Orwell describes, everyone was reminded that \"Big Brother is watching you,\" by way of a constant surveillance through the pervasive use of \"telescreens\" by the ruling class.\n\nOrwell's warnings about totalitarianism written in novel form in Animal Farm and 1984 came shortly after Friedrich Hayek's Road to Serfdom was published at the end of World War II. But it took the shocking revelations about Nazism and Soviet Communism, by scholars like William Shirer and Robert Conquest in the 1960s, to really make Orwell relevant for teaching to the masses educated in American public schools.\n\nReading Orwell, it was thought, would help American students appreciate their freedoms and gain perspective and critical faculties to understand socialist totalitarianism and its defining features: 1) the institutionalization of propaganda designed to warp and destroy people's grasp on reality, and 2) the fostering of groupthink, conformity, and collectivism designed to eliminate critical and independent thinking.\n\nOrwell described the scope of the totalitarian enterprise, noting in one section of 1984 that \"Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, and every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\"\n\nThe concepts of \"newspeak\" and \"doublethink\" in Orwell's 1984 are manifest in what we know now as political correctness. Newspeak is the distorted reality accomplished by manipulating the meaning of language and words, while doublethink is the conditioned mental attitude to ignore reality and common sense and substitute and embrace a distorted or false narrative.\n\nAs Orwell notes, \"the whole aim of Newspeak and Doublethink is to narrow the range of thought.\" Political correctness has the same goal and that's why its adherents are so intolerant -- seeking to shut down and silence people with whom they disagree on college campuses across the country, clamoring for removal of historic statues and monuments, and demanding that people with opposing views on such subjects as climate change and gay marriage be silenced, fined or arrested.\n\nMany assume that because the press is not state-controlled in the U.S., there is a long way to go before the American government has the power of Orwell's Big Brother.\n\nBut what if the universities and the educational system and the major television and print media institutions embrace the groupthink that ingratiates them with the ruling elite? What if the culture shapers in Hollywood and the advertising industry on Madison Avenue follow a similar path in participating in and reinforcing the same groupthink norms?\n\nAnd what if the rise of social media promotes a kind of groupthink conformity that effectively marginalizes and silences opposing views? Could it then be that propaganda in a free democratic nation like America might be more effective in shaping thought and attitudes than state-controlled propaganda in totalitarian societies?\n\nOrwell's Big Brother has become a reality in the NSA's tracking and recording of all email, text, and telephone communication in the United States. But Big Brother has a new dimension with social media and consumer giants, Google, Facebook, and Amazon knowing almost everything about people's preferences through their artificial intelligence peering into people's \"telescreen\" computers and smartphones.\n\nSocial media has great power to narrow the range of acceptable thought. On Facebook, those who openly support a politically correct view -- what appears to be the popular majority view -- are frequently lauded with thumbs up, while dissenters often remain silent to avoid being criticized or denounced. All of which leads to what is called \"the spiral of silence,\" which reinforces the groupthink of what appears to be the social and cultural majority.\n\nShortly after 9/11, Pam Geller began documenting and educating the public about radical Islam and Sharia law. Recently Facebook blocked Geller's newsfeed from her one million-plus followers, and Google followed suit, scrubbing the Geller Report from its search engines (since reversed due to public outcry).\n\nWhat comfortable and disengaged Americans have forgotten is that there are determined enemies within and there is an internal war being waged against the values and institutions that made America a great nation.\n\nThe left is the vanguard leading this war, following a course laid out by cultural Marxists such as Antonio Gramsci and members of the Frankfurt School. Becoming influential in the 1930s and beyond, they believed the \"long march through the institutions\" was the best route to taking power in developed, industrialized societies such as the United States and Europe. This \"march\" would be a gradual process of radicalization of the cultural institutions -- \"the superstructure\" -- of bourgeois society, which would transform the values and morals of society.\n\nIn retrospect, there is a high correlation between the softening of morals over the last two or three generations and the corruption of our family, political, legal and economic foundation.\n\nThere are three measures of the establishment's venality. First, there is a high incidence of denial, manifest for instance in little to no discussion of the doubling of national debt in just nine years to over $20 trillion, and unfunded entitlement liabilities now five times greater than that-conditions inviting financial collapse of the U.S.\n\nA second measure of corruption is the establishment's reluctance to prosecute fellow establishment lawbreakers in government, which has effectively created a two-tiered justice system. A third measure of establishment corruption is its accommodation of extremist anti-American groups as though they have a legitimate role to play in reform and influence on policy-making -- whether in taking down historic monuments, controlling the nation's borders, establishing police protocols in law enforcement, fighting wars overseas, or restructuring the economy at home.\n\nThe hostility to the Trump Presidency by the establishment elite in both political parties, the media, the teachers' unions and the university faculties, and Hollywood is probably a contrary indicator. It likely tells us more about the real state of corruption in government, the establishment media and popular culture than it does about Trump and his peccadillos.\n\nA society committed to maintaining liberty, prosperity, and opportunity for all, needs to focus on real threats, a key one of which is now the loss of freedom of speech.\n\nOne of the nation's founders, Patrick Henry, was a gifted and passionate orator best known for his declaration, \"Give me liberty or give me death.\" But his most important, substantive and lasting contribution to the legacy of freedom was his tenacious and ultimately successful fight to have the Bill of Rights amended to the Constitution because of his conviction that the First Amendment and nine others were absolutely necessary to protect individual liberty against the power and abuse of centralized government.\n\nOrwell reminds us today of the critical importance of the First Amendment, noting \"if liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\" Exactly the opposite of the current trajectory and what the politically correct crowd wants.", "The cheer that went up around the Riviera conference centre when Henry Bolton was announced as Ukip's new leader on Friday was as much an expression of relief as of celebration. A former policeman and soldier, Bolton is unknown outside his party and obscure within it.\n\nMany of the activists hugging one another after the declaration were celebrating the defeat of Dublin-born Anne Marie Waters, the bookies' favourite who was beaten into second place. Waters stayed away from the conference until a few minutes before the results of the leadership election were announced.\n\nShe swept into the press centre at the head of a small entourage and surrounded by cameras, every inch the victor in waiting. She brushed aside the suggestion of mass resignations if she won, in protest against her focus on Islam, a religion she has described as evil, and rejected the charge that her views were extreme.\n\n\"Well, they're not used to hearing the truth, it's as simple as that. The truth sounds extreme when it's been pushed out of the arena for such a long time,\" she said.\n\nWaters has a long-standing association with Tommy Robinson, a former leader of the extreme-right English Defence League and, apparently confident of victory, she suggested that he could join Ukip in future.\n\n\"He has no interest in joining the party. But it would depend on the members. I've no intention of lifting the current ban. But there can be, I think, discretion, if the members agree to it. But as I say, he's got no interest,\" she said.\n\nThen she swept out again to await the leadership declaration, obliged to sit through a lengthy video about the Icelandic fishing industry before hearing the news. The votes for each candidate were announced in ascending order and the cheering in the hall began when Waters was named as the runner-up with 21 per cent of the vote, compared to Bolton's 29 per cent.\n\nIn a press conference later, the new leader left no doubt that Ukip's choice was not only an endorsement of him but a rejection of Waters's campaign against Islam.\n\n\"There is an issue to be discussed and we need to do that in partnership with the Muslim community of Britain. We don't need to be confronting anyone, I absolutely abhor the rhetoric that says we are at war with Islam or anything that indicates as such,\" he said.\n\nBolton said it was for Waters to decide if she wished to remain in Ukip but he agreed that, by not electing her, it had avoided becoming the \"UK Nazi party\".\n\n\"Absolutely, I think the party has today voted for a leader who has been very open about what he feels is the way forward,\" he said.\n\nOutside, the vanquished warrior was nowhere to be seen but among the relieved delegates were a few who felt let down. Cathy Carey, who had the words \"Patriotism is not Racism\" emblazoned on her T-shirt, thought Ukip had missed an opportunity.\n\n\"I think she's prepared to expose a lot more of the corrupted truth. Islam is a major, major thing. But it's not just Islam, it's the Left, the totalitarian fascist regime that they have become in our country, what Europe has become - it's a fascist regime. And the Nazism that Islam is is staring us in the face,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm sick of being called a racist and a Nazi. They are the Nazis. They're here to conquer. They are invading by mass immigration.\"\n\nLiz Phillips said she never believed that Ukip members would choose Waters and she felt certain that Bolton was the right choice.\n\n\"I've known Henry Bolton for a long time and he really is a leader of men and he will lead this party. He will unite the party,\" she said.\n\nIan Walsh thought Ukip had dodged a bullet in rejecting Waters, arguing that, after Theresa May's speech in Florence last week, the party should focus on holding her to account over Brexit. \"Up until she made that speech, I believed she would do the right thing. Now I believe that it's Ukip's job to make sure that she does do the right thing.\"", "Vera Wang read The Handmaid's Tale over the summer and started watching the TV show. Ofglen and her fellow handmaids' bonnets appear in the collection video and lookbook she produced this season -- only Wang's aren't white, they're black. Margaret Atwood's dystopian depiction of a totalitarian United States struck a nerve with Wang, as it has done for so many. \"The loss of any personal freedom, the fear of retribution, the cruelty of forcing women to be so stratified and categorized\u200e, and most of all having to obliterate their pasts and their identities is something so profoundly troubling,\" Wang said in a statement. \"For the collection,\" she continued, \"control ultimately begets self-expression.\" Ofglen carved Nolite te bastardes carborundorum on her closet wall. For Spring, Wang customized her tailoring by exposing bras under jackets that peeled off the shoulder and adding corsetry seaming to others -- or even garter belts. Ironically enough, all that self-expression put her at the center of things (which is not a bad place to be); the corset is shaping up to be the accessory of the season.\n\nTailoring has been a preoccupation of Wang's recently. Accoutrements aside, the bridal dressmaker made a case for her suits, which came in a Balenciaga-ish check in both wool and printed silk. The silk version was a clever idea because it will give her customer the pulled-together look of tailoring with the potential ease and comfort of a dress. That having-it-both-ways concept extended to other pieces in the collection, including the dress in white or black that combined a boxy men's cotton shirt on top with a skirt of luminous bias-cut silk satin below. Because of the lingerie details here, the line between day and night was blurred. Wang likes the nebulous areas, so she mixed things up just as much for after dark. Metallic paillettes met more of that wool plaid, and a button-down dickey accessorized a long Victorian-ish white dress. It was unaccountably compelling.", "It's good news that women will soon be able to drive in Saudi Arabia. But as a milestone, it isn't primarily a marker of sex equality, which remains a distant objective in the kingdom. Rather, it's an important indication that the monarchy now thinks it doesn't have to defer to the country's religious establishment.\n\nThat's a remarkable development that may allow some modernization -- but also heralds a move away from the separation of powers and toward consolidation of absolute authority in a totalitarian king.\n\nAlthough it's little understood in the West, the Saudi dynasty was built on a foundational partnership between kingly and religious authority. On the worldly side was the royal House of Saud, going back to the 18th-century founder Muhammad bin Saud. On the spiritual side was what is called the House of the Sheikh. That name refers to the Arabian sheikh par excellence: Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century founder of Wahhabism.\n\nThe partnership's modern form was established during the career of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding monarch of the current Saudi state, who died in 1953. The basic constitutional idea is that the religious scholars, associated with the House of the Sheikh, provide the formal legal justification for the monarch's rule.\n\nIn theory, the scholars get to determine what rules are consistent with Islamic law. The monarch then carries out those rulings. His authority to govern legitimately is ultimately supposed to rest on his compliance with the Shariah as interpreted by the scholars.\n\nIn practice, like all separation of powers, however rudimentary, there is negotiation and compromise. Oil wealth has given the monarchy far more influence and therefore room for maneuver than it would otherwise have. Scholars can be co-opted or at least influenced through lucrative government posts.\n\nBut the religious scholars have never forgotten that their institutional power can be preserved only if they continue to say no to certain reforms sought by the monarchy. The scholars' background threat is that they might withdraw their support for the monarch. They couldn't bring down a king on their own, but they could lend their moral support to a coup. That has been all the leverage they traditionally needed.\n\nThe ban on women driving has long been a highly visible, symbolic instance of the religious scholars' exercise of a veto power over the monarchy. For least 25 years, perhaps longer, Saudi kings have been delicately exploring the possibility of allowing women to drive. But the scholars have always given a clear no.\n\nThe reason had less to do with any really compelling principle of Islamic law than with the scholars' institutional need to demonstrate their authority. Religious conservatism is the scholars' brand and the source of their power.\n\nThat's why the driving announcement is so important for the distribution of power in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman is engaged in a historic experiment: the most significant attempt to consolidate the monarch's power in the last 75 years of Saudi history. That involves marginalizing the rest of the royal family and focusing authority in his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Crucially, it also involves weakening the authority of the religious establishment.\n\nBy permitting driving, King Salman is telling Saudis that the clerics now have less power than they did before. And he's sending a message to the clerics themselves: be flexible or be ignored.\n\nThis is a delicate game, to say the least. The steps Salman and Muhammad have taken to centralize power leave them vulnerable to pushback from other members of the royal family who might fantasize about trying to replace the crown prince and maybe even his father. Alienating the religious establishment would give clerics the incentive to back a competing candidate.\n\nIn a sense, then, this is a test of the traditional system of clerical influence. The king and the crown prince are betting that the old system has been sufficiently weakened that it will now fail.\n\nIf that happens, the consequences will be major -- and very tricky.\n\nFrom the standpoint of many Western onlookers, the collapse or at least great weakening of the conservative religious scholars will seem like a happy result. After all, the scholars have long blocked egalitarian reforms.\n\nYet it's important to remember that, notwithstanding their conservatism, the scholars have also balanced and to a degree checked the monarchy. Unfettered power tends to become not merely authoritarian, but totalitarian. And an unchecked monarchy may in the long run have drawbacks for Saudi subjects, male or female.\n\nIt's natural to celebrate allowing women to drive. But real sex equality is still several generations away in Saudi Arabia, if that. The true development is yet another increase in royal prerogative. The experiment is under way. The outcome remains uncertain.", "Clearly the danger that is North Korea far extends beyond nuclear weapons. The issue of a North Korean collapse or some sort of forced snap reunification with the South will very likely be a challenge America and its allies in Asia will have to tackle at some point in the future as history shows no dictatorship lasts forever. So instead of scouring the headlines looking for the latest news on the DPRK's nuke test. . . read this report instead.\n\nWhat is left to say at this point when it comes to that \"Hermit Kingdom\" everyone loves to hate? North Korea, or also known as the so-called Democratic People's Republic, is the ultimate Pandora's Box and every president's worst nightmare: A-bombs, chemical toxins, biological weapons and missiles to lob them all over the world -- including now at the continental United States. And Pyongyang knows how to get the news cycle to turn its way -- thanks to making Northeast Asia shake with a fresh atomic test.\n\nRecommended: The Case for War with North Korea\n\nAnd yet, while North Korea flexing its atomic muscles is certainly a big deal, the world is missing the real story: What happens if someday North Korea falls apart through a mass uprising, economic disaster, or war? Plus-sized bad boy Kim Jung-un is at the head of a state that would likely take trillions of dollars to turn around towards anything resembling normal -- say nothing of putting the lives back together of millions of people who been brainwashed, starved and treated as slaves.\n\nRecommended: China's New Stealth Fighter Has Arrived\n\nBack in 2013, an excellent research paper, more like a book if you look at length alone, was released by the RAND Corporation that tackles this issue and is well worth your time. The author of the report, Bruce Bennett, lays out a chilling tale of what could happen, what it would take to put the pieces back together and what Washington and its allies should do to prepare for such a contingency. As I love to do, here are five highlights from the report, which I would argue, demonstrates the real issue when it comes to North Korea.\n\n1. What 'Type' of Collapses Are Possible?\n\n\"Under what circumstances might the Kim Jong-Un regime collapse? Such a collapse could come in one of two forms: regime collapse and government collapse. In a regime collapse, the Kim family regime (and Kim Jong-Un, in particular) is overthrown, and some new leader takes control of North Korea, likely rising from within the military. Under this case, the national control mechanisms and organization could remain largely in place, although the overthrow will certainly disrupt the mechanisms for a period. The new ruler would be prone to purge many of the senior government leaders and replace them with personnel loyal to him.\"\n\nThe next scenario is far scarier.\n\n\"The alternative kind of collapse would be a government collapse. In this case, the Kim family regime would fail or be overthrown, and no single individual or group would be able to form a new central North Korean government. Most likely, factions would develop, each trying to control parts of the country, with some possibly having very weak control even over their own areas. Many central government functions would fail, including much of the control system.\n\n\"Note that regime collapse could be a step along the path to government collapse. Indeed, collapse is both a process and an outcome. North Korea has not yet suffered either regime or government collapse, but the collapse process appears to be under way already. Thus, the Kim regime is perhaps best classified as a \"failing or eroding totalitarian system.\"\n\n2. A Civil War Is Possible.\n\n\"A civil war in North Korea and especially the use of WMD could spill over into the ROK and cause serious damage. Factional forces could cause considerable damage with artillery and special forces attacks on the ROK, especially if nuclear and/or biological weapons are used. In addition, one or more North Korean factions could purposefully attack the ROK, potentially as a form of revenge if they perceive themselves unlikely to survive. Thus, ballistic missile attacks against ROK cities -- especially ones using nuclear weapons or even chemical or biological weapons -- could cause damage across the ROK. Besides the physical damage done, the ROK economy and society could be significantly affected. All these consequences could make it difficult for the ROK to pay for and manage unification. From a ROK perspective, the worst outcome could be destabilization of all of Korea, including the ROK, as crime and insurgency spread, if the ROK is unable to contain and defeat them.\"\n\n3. It Gets Worse: China Could Intervene.\n\n\"In addition, China could intervene; indeed, some say that China would be likely to intervene. In doing so, China could try to thwart unification... As ROK, U.S., and Chinese forces advance, conflict could develop between the ROK-United States and China. Both Chinese efforts to thwart unification and conflict with China could further jeopardize Korean unification.\"", "The Prisoner -- a science fiction series about a former spy confined in a mysterious totalitarian enclave -- was both the most experimental and the most anti-authoritarian TV program of the '60s.

I always want that final shofar blast to truly awaken me, to shake me into action, to help me become a better person, but I usually find myself drifting back into my normal routine in a matter of weeks. Not this year.\n\nThis year, there is too much at stake. The world is too broken to neglect tikkun olam. The commandment to pursue justice carries more weight now that the United States seems so devoid of it. I will begin this year marching, and I hope that the whole Jewish community will join me.\n\nThe American Union of Jewish Students (AMUJS), in partnership with the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), is organizing Jewish activists to participate in the March for Racial Justice in New York, Providence, Chicago, and elsewhere on the day after Yom Kippur. I plan to march in Providence, Rhode Island with my fellow students and with activists from all over New England.\n\nI march because I am a Jew. I inherited a religious tradition that demands action, and a legacy of organizing that must be carried forward. From Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to Harvey Milk, Jews have been at the forefront of some of America's greatest social movements. The American Jewish community must step up now as well.\n\nI march because I am a human being, a person who cares about other people. Therefore, I recognize that Black, Brown, and Native lives matter and I cannot ignore the plagues of racism, mass incarceration, police brutality, misogyny, and so much more that afflict the United States.\n\nI march because I am an American citizen. That citizenship endows me with unique power, and therefore a unique obligation, to fight for a better system. As a citizen, moreover, I am acutely aware of the crumbling of America's democratic institutions. I understand that the threat to democracy begins with the systematic disenfranchisement of Black, Brown, and Native Americans. The great Jewish scholar Hannah Arendt, in her chapter on \"The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man\" in The Origins of Totalitarianism, wrote about the tendency of totalitarian regimes (particularly those of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union) to gain the loyalty of local police forces, and thus the ability to violently control whole societies, by offering to law enforcement \"domination over vast groups of people [especially refugees and undocumented immigrants], who, regardless of any offenses committed by individuals, found themselves anyway beyond the pale of the law.\" Every time I hear a chant of \"blue lives matter\" or learn more about the ways in which the Trump administration has intensified the persecution of Latinx people, I notice the striking parallels.\n\nI march because I am a person of enormous privilege. My white privilege, male privilege, cisgender privilege, and more make me complicit in the systems of oppression against which the March for Racial Justice is protesting. I have a responsibility, given that complicity, to serve as an ally to marginalized communities.\n\nI march because I am an activist committed to defeating anti-Semitism. Even as I stand as an ally to other groups, I also stand for myself, as a Jew and a frequent target of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism and anti-Black racism are deeply connected, both throughout history, as James Whitman described in Hitler's American Model: the United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law, and today, as Emma Green described in the Atlantic following the Nazi rally in Charlottesville last summer. Duke Divinity School's Dr. J. Kameron Carter argued in his book, Race: A Theological Account, that Christian anti-Judaism and the racialization of Jews were at the core of white supremacy and modern racism from the moment that Immanuel Kant presented \"to the modern world its first scientific theory or philosophical account of race\" - in a body of writing laden with anti-Semitism. The resurgence of anti-Semitism in the United States is thoroughly entangled with the resurgence of other forms of racism, and we must confront all of those hatreds together.\n\nI march because I am a critic of social justice movements that do not confront anti-Semitism. I have written extensively on the issue of pro-justice movements' frequent failure to include Jews, so it is especially important to me to endorse and show up for those actions that do take Jewish needs seriously. The organizers of the March for Racial Justice wrote into the mission statement explicit condemnations of anti-Semitism and, after accidentally scheduling the march on Yom Kippur, not only released a genuine, heartfelt apology (reading over it again as I write this article, I am nearly moved to tears), but also applied for legal permits and rescheduled several sister marches in order to accommodate Jewish religious observance.\n\nI march because I am a student of Jewish history.

But as a milestone, it isn't primarily a marker of sex equality, which remains a distant objective in the kingdom. Rather, it's an important indication that the monarchy now thinks it doesn't have to defer to the country's religious establishment.\n\nThat's a remarkable development that may allow some modernization -- but also heralds a move away from the separation of powers and toward consolidation of absolute authority in a totalitarian king.\n\nThe Saudi dynasty was built on a foundational partnership between kingly and religious authority. On the worldly side was the royal House of Saud, going back to the 18th-century founder Muhammad bin Saud. On the spiritual side was what is called the House of the Sheikh. That name refers to the Arabian sheikh par excellence: Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century founder of Wahhabism.\n\nThe partnership's modern form was established during the career of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding monarch of the Saudi state, who died in 1953. The basic constitutional idea is that the religious scholars, associated with the House of the Sheikh, provide the formal legal justification for the monarch's rule.\n\nIn theory, the scholars get to determine what rules are consistent with Islamic law. The monarch then carries out those rulings. His authority to govern legitimately is ultimately supposed to rest on his compliance with the Shariah as interpreted by the scholars.\n\nIn practice, like all separation of powers, however rudimentary, there is negotiation and compromise. Oil wealth has given the monarchy far more influence and therefore room for maneuver than it would otherwise have. Scholars can be co-opted or at least influenced through lucrative government posts.\n\nBut the religious scholars have never forgotten that their institutional power can be preserved only if they continue to say no to certain reforms sought by the monarchy. The scholars' background threat is that they might withdraw their support for the monarch. They couldn't bring down a king on their own, but they could lend their moral support to a coup. That has been all the leverage they traditionally needed.\n\nThe ban on women driving has long been a highly visible, symbolic instance of the religious scholars' exercise of a veto power over the monarchy. For least 25 years, perhaps longer, Saudi kings have been delicately exploring the possibility of allowing women to drive. But the scholars have always given a clear no.\n\nThe reason had less to do with any really compelling principle of Islamic law than with the scholars' institutional need to demonstrate their authority. Religious conservatism is the scholars' brand and the source of their power.\n\nThat's why the driving announcement is so important for the distribution of power in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman is engaged in a historic experiment: the most significant attempt to consolidate the monarch's power in the last 75 years of Saudi history. That involves marginalizing the rest of the royal family and focusing authority in his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Crucially, it also involves weakening the authority of the religious establishment.\n\nBy permitting driving, King Salman is telling Saudis that the clerics now have less power than they did before. And he's sending a message to the clerics themselves: be flexible or be ignored.\n\nThis is a delicate game, to say the least. The steps Salman and Muhammad have taken to centralize power leave them vulnerable to pushback from other members of the royal family who might fantasize about trying to replace the crown prince and maybe even his father. Alienating the religious establishment would give clerics the incentive to back a competing candidate.\n\nIn a sense, this is a test of the traditional system of clerical influence. The king and the crown prince are betting that the old system has been sufficiently weakened that it will now fail.\n\nIf that happens, the consequences will be major -- and very tricky.\n\nFrom the standpoint of many Western onlookers, the collapse or at least great weakening of the conservative religious scholars will seem like a happy result. After all, the scholars have long blocked egalitarian reforms.\n\nYet it's important to remember that, notwithstanding their conservatism, the scholars have also balanced and to a degree checked the monarchy. Unfettered power tends to become not merely authoritarian, but totalitarian. And an unchecked monarchy may in the long run have drawbacks for Saudi subjects, male or female.\n\nIt's natural to celebrate allowing women to drive. But real sex equality is still several generations away in Saudi Arabia, if that. The true development is yet another increase in royal prerogative.\n\nThe experiment is under way. The outcome remains uncertain.\n\nNoah Feldman is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Isn't the liberty Henry was referring to about freedom of expression, about the freedom to protest against injustice in our society?\n\nI know what you're going to say: you recognize the right of NFL players and their supporters to protest, you just don't think refusal to participate in patriotic displays is an acceptable form of protest. That's fine; you're entitled to that opinion, but President Trump and many of you aren't content to leave it at agree to disagree. Many believe there should be consequences for taking a knee. Offenders should be fired, ridiculed, shamed, expelled from events and even physically assaulted.\n\nWhat do the U.S. and North Korea have in common other than belligerent, egocentric leaders? Both countries love ostentatious displays of patriotism and are the only countries that require children to recite a pledge of allegiance.\n\nActually, a SCOTUS decision from 1943 says that U.S. children cannot be required to recite the pledge, but most school districts and teachers ignore the ruling. A student in Michigan was recently yanked from his seat by his teacher when he did not stand for the pledge, and when that teacher was suspended for the assault, was verbally abused the next day for the same behavior by the substitute.\n\nInterestingly, American kids used to salute the sky while reciting the pledge, but Hitler put that gesture out of fashion.\n\nAlmost as much as they love football, many Americans love to question the patriotism of others. Are we so insecure as a people that we must be constantly affirming our loyalty to the state?\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance smells of totalitarianism and ought to be retired. The National Anthem is a fine song, but do we really need to play it as often as we do? Soccer matches in Europe and elsewhere aren't preceded by the playing of national anthems.\n\nHow about we play ours on opening day of each sports season and on the Fourth of July, Memorial Day and other special occasions? And standing for the National Anthem should be optional.\n\nPatriotism is about the way we live our lives, about our contributions to our communities, not about bumper stickers or flag waving or lustily singing a song. And no American is competent to judge the patriotism of another. Your neighbor who flies the massive flag outside his home could be spending most of his day on his computer watching kiddie porn, while the athlete you despise for taking a knee during the National Anthem may be funding a free clinic for poor people. Who of the two is the more patriotic?\n\nBut what about showing support for our troops? Support for our military personnel has got nothing to do with songs and mindless recitations of loyalty oaths; genuine support involves keeping abreast of issues, making sure our soldiers are not needlessly put in harm's way and making sure they have the necessary resources to succeed, and above all, making sure they receive the highest standards of care if they do come to harm.\n\n\"Patriotism,\" Samuel Johnson said, \"is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\" Although Johnson was no supporter of the American Revolution, his is a sentiment our Founding Fathers would have roundly endorsed, with the understanding that Johnson refers to false patriots, those who wrap themselves in a flag and use love of country to advance a divisive agenda.\n\nTrue patriots are uniters, not dividers; true patriots listen to rather than insult those with whom they disagree.

But they're not the same thing. Patriots love their country because it does good things; for nationalists it's our country right or wrong. A lot of stuff nationalists call patriotic couldn't possibly be more un-American.\n\nThe singing of the national anthem before sporting events, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, are prime examples.\n\nThe latest nationalism vs. patriotism controversy arrives courtesy of Colin Kaepernick, the African-American pro football player blackballed by the NFL for kneeling in silent protest over police shootings of blacks rather than stand for the signing of the national anthem alongside his teammates and fans before games. The \"take a knee\" movement has spread throughout the league, largely in response to President Trump's crude remark that those who refuse to stand during \"The Star Spangled Banner\" are \"sons of bitches.\"\n\nAt football games and similar events where the anthem is sung, standers far outnumber kneelers -- and that's weird. Because if one person is kneeling against police brutality, then it stands to reason that standing up means you support cops gunning down unarmed black people. Are there really that many racists?\n\nThat, and when you stop to think about it, the whole idea of rote rituals to prove our loyalty runs completely counter to what most Americans, liberal or conservative, think their country is about.\n\nAs I have written before, lefties and righties don't have the same ambitions for the U.S. Following the tradition of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Left idealizes individual rights. They dream of a country where everyone is not only created equal, but treated accordingly. The Right values empire. Rightists' ideal America is a global military and economic superpower.\n\nStill, the two sides have something in common. They want to be left alone, to live their lives as free of government interference as possible. Progressives want the government out of their bedrooms. Traditionalists want it out of their incomes. Totalitarianism -- a form of government whose control over citizens' daily lives leads to the requirement that everyone attend one meeting after another and report dissent to the authorities -- could no more catch on here than North Korean-style displays of signs flipped by synchronized flags or parades of military hardware (though Trump wants to start those).\n\nLike the singing of the anthem at games, the Pledge of Allegiance reflects a totalitarian impulse you find in fascist and authoritarian regimes, not democracies. The U.S. and Canada are the only countries on earth where national anthems are played at the start of sporting events. Even in many authoritarian states, the requirement that children (and athletes) swear fealty to the nation (or, as here, its flag) would be considered too creepy to contemplate.\n\nWhen your country is crazier than Zimbabwe, it's time to take stock -- even if you're a Republican.\n\nOther nations require oaths of allegiance from those taking public office, like members of parliament. Some ask the same of foreigners seeking to become naturalized citizens. But the U.S. may be the only nation on earth to have a widely-used pledge of allegiance.\n\nChildren who refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance are routinely punished, criticized and ostracized, even in public schools. I know -- it happened to me in elementary school. Kaepernick, a top-tier athlete, has been denied employment. These are obvious violations of the all-American value of free speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nThe addition of \"under God\" in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy era and its rancid loyalty oaths, further violates another core principle of Americanism, the freedom to worship as you please or not at all as protected under the Establishment Clause of the US. Constitution.\n\nIn one respect, however, the Pledge of Allegiance owes its origins to something that couldn't be more American: a huckster out to make a few extra bucks.\n\nWhy do Americans pledge allegiance to the \"flag,\" as opposed to the nation or its government? It boils down to capitalist greed. The origins of the Pledge date to 1892, when James B. Upham, the marketing executive of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion used the 400th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas to promote a conference in honor of the American flag. He pushed the Pledge in his magazine as a way to promote nationalism and sell flags to public schools. Schoolhouses purchased 26,000 flags the first year alone.\n\nKids reciting the pledge were supposed to raise their arms at the same time -- yep, the Hitler \"sieg heil\" salute before Hitler. World War II put an end to that in American schools.\n\nHaving traveled extensively, I have observed that the countries whose governments insist upon the most extravagant displays of nationalism line up neatly with those with the least personal freedom. In authoritarian China and the police state of Turkmenistan, national flags and banners extolling slogans and quotes of the ruling party festoon every government office and pedestrian overpass. As Turkey moves away from democracy and closer to autocracy, Turkish flag stickers multiply on automobiles.\n\nIt is the opposite in the European democracies. A Frenchman who hung a French flag from his front porch would be ridiculed by his neighbors, socialist and Le Pen supporter alike. It is not that the French and the Dutch and the Spanish and other Europeans do not love their countries as much as Americans do; if anything, most Europeans are grateful that their countries are not like ours. They are patriots. And they remember World War II, when those who liked to wave flags and insisted on loyalty oaths to the state turned out to be dangerous.\n\nEveryone should sit out the singing of the national anthem. It's archaic and uncomfortably reminiscent of fascism.\n\nIt is time to leave the Pledge of Allegiance where it belongs, on the dungheap of history, remembered as a clever way to move piles of colored cloth.", "El Mundo finds the French president's plans inspiring:\n\n\"What Macron has cleverly and opportunely proposed is the move towards a United States of Europe, which implies integration in key areas such as the economy, immigration and education. ...

At the same time, it's difficult to not get at least a chuckle out of his animated insults to Trump. After all, Trump did call Kim \"Rocket Man\" on an international stage. Maybe Twitter's joking about it as a coping mechanism for the sky-high tensions between North Korea and the United States. Either way, these jokes make the best out of an otherwise terrible situation. Kim's remarks actually used a lot of creative words to characterize Trump.

He sanitized porn, stripped it of blemishes, odors, fluids, friction, and body hair. He made dirty look clean -- or as his ingenious counter-crusader, Erica Jong, would say, zipless. He made free look like fun. He was a Pied Piper for lifestyle as life. The airbrush was his weapon. His entrepreneurial genius made him the prophet of an American-based, worldwide cult devoted to the secular ritual of the no-commitment orgasm. Live it up, American male! he proclaimed in living color. You lived through the Great Depression and the Great War, lucky guy, and now it's time to get down, dirty, and free.\n\nIn the process, whatever more limited objective he might have had in mind at first, he found himself a cultural revolutionary, a global brand, an impresario of arm candy, of sex with winks but not leers, driving the old, expiring, censorious America into the DTs. That is, he escorted America over the threshold to a world of Deep Throat and also, eventually, his acolyte Donald Trump, who at a Playboy mansion party to which he escorted \"Apprentice\" figures, told Hef: \"It's hard for me to tell which of these girls are yours, and which ones are mine.\" He flattered generations of would-be models, equipping them with phony r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to accompany centerfolds, and he crusaded . He inspired Gloria Steinem to burrow underground as a Bunny. He made generations of boys think that women came with staples in their navels.\n\nDid he objectify women? Is the Pope Catholic?

The moderately dirty pictures of pin-ups like the famous Bettie Page were studded among outdoor adventure and war stories. Their literary pretensions were nil.\n\nHefner changed that. He made sex middle-class, an activity for pipe-smoking bachelors who were unleashed to be fast and loose, finding their meaning in leisure time pursuits. His ideal readers not only had bedrooms, they subscribed to the Book-of-the-Month Club. They had record-players and sports cars. But his readers were not encouraged to be mindless sex maniacs.

In his inaugural issue Hef famously issued a manifesto for the life of the postwar bourgeois with this proclamation:\n\nWe enjoy mixing up cocktails and an hors d'oeuvre or two, putting a little mood music on the phonograph, and inviting in a female acquaintance for a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex.\n\nHef prided himself on upholstering his magazine with the best and the brightest. He published Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Mario Vargas Llosa, Margaret Atwood, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, you name 'em. He paid his writers top dollar. He ran interviews with Miles Davis, Martin Luther King, Bob Dylan, Malcolm X, Vladimir Nabokov, and Henry Miller. It was in Playboy, June 1973, that Alfred Kazin published his great essay, \"The Writer as Political Crazy,\" reaming out the likes of D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, and Jean Genet for their slavish surrender to one or another totalitarian rapture. That issue also contained a piece by the great Vietnam war correspondent Gloria Emerson. Hefner mellowed into a certain peace with feminists. He was a First Amendment absolutist. Love him, he was a liberal. And in the process, he helped turn the counterculture into the culture.\n\nHefner must have felt like a winner, having probably changed everyday life more than any other American of his generation. He probably did not know he was checking out during the Days of Awe, when observant Jews ransack their memories in search of sins for which to atone on Yom Kippur. Atonement wasn't his game. During his last conscious moments, did he lick his lips and tick off the scores he had somehow, along the way, missed? Did he imagine eternal rest in postcoital satisfaction, knowing that, in the house of today's world there are many -- so many -- Playboy Mansions?\n\nTodd Gitlin, professor of journalism and sociology and chair of the Ph.D. program in Communications at Columbia University, is the author of The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage; Occupy Nation: The Roots, the Spirit, and the Promise of Occupy Wall Street; and, with Liel Leibovitz, The Chosen Peoples: America, Israel, and the Ordeals of Divine Election.", "The flag is a symbol, and there is no agreement as to what it actually symbolizes. By design, the flag's thirteen stripes stand for the original 13 states, none of which would ban slavery. The 14th state, Vermont, was the first state to ban slavery, doing it weakly in its 1777 state constitution (not that the principle was enforced: in 1802 the Town of Windsor sued a State Supreme Court justice to get him to take care of an elderly, infirm slave he had dumped on town welfare; the town lost the case). The original flag had 13 stars for those same original 13 states, and it took over 70 years before all 36 stars in the 1865 flag represented states without slavery (but not states without racist Jim Crow laws and the freedom to lynch without consequence). The colors of the stars and stripes had no meaning in 1777, when it was adopted, as distinct from the colors of the Great Seal that did have meaning.\n\nThen there's the Star Spangled Banner, written by a slave owner in celebration of the defense of a slave state in a battle against the British. The British force included a contingent of former slaves who were promised freedom if they fought for the British. How many people at the beginning of a sports event understand \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\" in its deepest historical irony?\n\nAll in all, the typical American flag ritual is an exercise in mindless obedience in which any talk of real meaning interferes with the underlying objective of fealty to the state. The ritual is totemic and totalitarian, but not so extreme as the Two Minutes Hate required by the Party in George Orwell's novel \"1984.\" The difference is one of degree, not kind, and the enemy in both instances is rational, individual thought.\n\nMindless obedience has long been a goal of self-appointed patriots, wrapping themselves in the flag to defend indefensible domestic injustice or criminal wars (both of which we have more than our share these days). There is no meaning in the demand to \"respect\" any abstract symbol, much less one as drenched in horrifying contradiction as the American flag. In a mature world, respect is what you earn, not what you demand. In a mature world, a person is respected for who and what he or she is and does, not for any office or position of authority. We do not live in a mature world.\n\nSome quarterbacks are more obtuse than others\n\nMore than a year ago, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick first sat quietly, then kneeled during the national anthem at the beginning of his team's games. The gesture was quiet, respectful, and principled. And Kaepernick was articulate in his explanation that he was objecting to bigotry and injustice in America, and especially to police suffering no consequences for shooting and killing unarmed black men. For this objection, he has been blacklisted by the National Football League owners, the same owners who turkey-danced in all directions last weekend in a panic to find the right response to an intensity of protest they mostly neither shared nor understood, beyond the need for public relations management.\n\nNo one has a coherent argument for saluting the flag, because there isn't one. The flag ritual is an expression of our secular religion, American Exceptionalism. Coherence and reason are at best irrelevant and require suppression before they spread and become a threat. The result is widespread confusion among a large portion of the population, expressed as sincerely and sadly as anyone by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. Brees started by making it about President Trump, which it's not, and then went on to say with inarticulate imprecision: \"I disagree with what the President said and how he said it. I think it's very unbecoming of the office of the President of the United States to talk like that to the great people like that.\"\n\nThe rest of the Drew Brees statement got even more disconnected in its thought pattern:\n\nWell, let me say this first: Do I think that there is inequality in this country? Yes, I do. Do I think that there is racism? Yes, I do. I think there's inequality for women, for women in the workplace. I think that there's inequality for people of color, for minorities, for immigrants.\n\nBut as it pertains to the National Anthem, I will always feel that if you are an American, that the National Anthem is the opportunity for us all to stand up together, to be unified and to show respect for our country, to show respect for what it stands for, the birth of our nation.\n\nWe will -- there will always be issues with our country. There will always be things that we're battling, and we should all be striving to make those things better.\n\nBut if the protest becomes that we're going to sit down or kneel or not show respect to the flag of the United States of America and everything that it symbolizes and everything that it stands for and everything that our country has been through to get to this point, I do not agree with that.\n\nI feel like that is a unifying thing.\n\nThe national anthem and standing for the national anthem and looking at the flag with your hand over your heart is a unifying thing that should bring us all together and say, \"You know what? We know that things are not where they should be, but we will continue to work and strive to make things better, to bring equality to all people: men, women, no matter what your race, creed, religion - it doesn't matter - equality for all.\" But if you're an American, then I will always believe that we should be standing, showing respect to our flag with our hand over our heart.\n\nWell, that's just nuts. And it hasn't worked. Historically, all the flag worship in the world has done little to assure justice. Like an ungodly number of his fellow citizens, Brees is deep in American denial. His is a common knee-jerk response, absent logical thought despite some accurate perceptions. Yes, it sort of sounds good - until you try to figure out what it means. Knee-jerk reactions are not about knees but jerks. And when people like Brees are standing for the national anthem, what are they really standing for?\n\nIs this a tipping point? Are we watching a fad or a movement?\n\nWhen Colin Kaepernick was protesting alone in 2016, it's doubtful even he expected to see so many NFL players and owners expressing such solidarity and support in 2017. Granted, the message was muddled, as some players kneeled, some linked arms, some stayed in the locker room, and so on, with no clear message emerging beyond, perhaps, some disgruntlement at being dissed by Trump. The game is on, but it's not clear yet what the game is, and no clear leadership has emerged. But the legitimacy of professional American athletes protesting, even in the mildest way, is a new thing. If the protest expands and endures and coheres, it could be a very good thing for the country. These protestors include an inordinate number of new millionaires who have decided not to forget what they know about being black and brown in this America. And for anyone wondering what that means, there's America's response to storms in Texas and Florida, and America's virtual abandonment of Puerto Rico, as Trump blames the looted colony for being at the mercy of the United States. Puerto Ricans are American citizens who serve in the US military at disproportionately high rates. Tell them about saluting the flag.\n\nAnd now sports protest has spread from professional football to major league baseball, although just barely. On September 23, Oakland Athletics rookie catcher Bruce Maxwell became first major league baseball player to kneel for the national anthem, hat over his heart and a teammate's hand on his shoulder. Maxwell was born on a US military base in Germany. He is the son of a career soldier. Maxwell's statement after the event had a coherence Drew Brees should envy:\n\nThe point of my kneeling is not to disrespect our military. It's not to disrespect our constitution. My hand was over my heart because I love this country. I've had plenty of family members, including my father, that have bled for this country, that continue to serve for this country. At the end of the day, this is the best country on the planet. I am and forever will be an American citizen, and I'm more than forever grateful for being here. But my kneeling is what is getting the attention, because I'm kneeling for the people that don't have a voice. This goes beyond the black community. This goes beyond the Hispanic community. Because right now we're having a racial divide in all types of people. It's being practiced from the highest power that we have in this country, and he's basically saying that it's OK to treat people differently. My kneeling, the way I did it, was to symbolize the fact that I'm kneeling for a cause, but I'm in no way or form disrespecting my country or my flag.\n\nMaxwell is, intentionally or not, echoing Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address in 1861, when he said, with seven states already seceded from the union for the sake of slavery:\n\nWe are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\n\nWe have no president today capable of such words, and even less capable of such sentiments. That understanding is part of what drives NFL players to demonstrate, however inchoately. From Kaepernick to Maxwell, professional athletes are in touch with our better angels, and this is something new in American life. It is enough to give one hope, at least for the moment. Maybe they will be bullied back into silence and mindless obedience by the screechers demanding respect - respect for the flag, respect for the military, respect for the police even though they keep killing unarmed black people (and others). The screechers know no boundaries and are unburdened by integrity; they want only consent by any means necessary. But they are screeching for a despicable president who earns disrespect daily, so maybe hundreds, even thousands of over-privileged professional athletes will become America's saving grace. We're a long way from there. But wouldn't that be an amazing example of giving something back?", "Thomas Ricks' book is the latest offering history's lessons in our dangerous time.\n\nDonald Trump's reactionary presidency and Silicon Valley's spying on online users is pushing the nation and world in dangerous directions comparable to past eras, where authoritarian rule and totalitarian belief held sway. A handful of writers have urged Americans to heed history's lessons on resisting tyranny in all of its forms.\n\nOne of the most recent is Thomas Ricks, who for the past two decades has been among the most prominent journalists covering the military and war. His newest book compares and contrasts Winston Churchill and George Orwell, tracing how both came to recognize and resist abuses of power and political propaganda to side with individual dignity.\n\nAlterNet's Steven Rosenfeld interviewed Ricks, who recounted those lessons and their critical relevance today in an era dominated by fake news politics and predatory hi-tech.\n\nSteven Rosenfeld: Your book, Churchill and Orwell: The Fight for Freedom, is remarkable in many ways. You tell how both men shaped the 20th century and remain relevant. You describe how they evolved, held their own against their day's political conformists and ideologues, both left and right; and how they came to understand how authoritarian and totalitarian regimes operate.\n\nThe takeaways are resonate today, whether we're talking about an executive branch that lies, erases and revises history, or the tech sector that spies on citizens and sells its files. What prompted these men, and especially Orwell, to reject herd mentalities in private and in public?\n\nThomas Ricks: Oddly enough, I suspect for Orwell, it began with his love of personal observation. Even a child, he loved observing nature, and that continued throughout his life. If you read his diaries, he had a habit of just writing down what he physically sees around him, what he's thinking about, what he's hearing people talk about -- just basic observation. I think for Orwell, that becomes a part of departure, that human freedom begins with the right to perceive and to trust your own perceptions.\n\nOf course, Orwell as an adult, bangs up against Stalinism, which says, No, we will tell you what to think. If you're a good member of the Communist Party, you will believe what we tell you to think. We will decide what is right and what is wrong. We will decide what the facts of the matter are.\n\nThat's where Orwell breaks with Stalinism, but he doesn't break with the left. He remains a socialist all his life.\n\nSR: That's what's so interesting about this, at least in more recent modern America. The political right has lionized Orwell, and not the left, which you point out.\n\nTR: That's one thing I was trying to do in this book, was to kind of recover both these guys for liberalism, and even progressivism. Churchill was not always a conservative, and Orwell was always the socialist. Yet both have been claimed by the American right, in ways that I dislike. With this but I was trying to say, Churchill is more complex political figure than he's seen as today, and Orwell should be seen properly as a member of the left throughout his life. Delivering a leftist critique of Western capitalist democratic society, all his life.\n\nSR: When you say you want to recover their legacy for liberalism, what you're talking about is they both, and particularly Orwell, rejected political ideologues of their day based on personal experience. They came to understand how authoritarian and totalitarian systems work, and how propaganda works. Can you describe that arc?\n\nTR: Sure. Orwell goes into the 1930s, a pretty typical leftist of his time. He believes leftist good, right is bad. So socialism and communism is good, and capitalism and fascism, bad. Then he goes to Spain late in 1936. There he has the great political education of his life. He is a member of a small political splinter group they're fighting in the Spanish Civil War, anarchist Trotskyites. They are part of the left, but they are not mainstream left in Spain.\n\nNow the problem was at the time, Stalin of Russia could not stand the idea of a competing leader of world communism. With Trotsky having been a comrade of Stalin's, and then fled Russia, what was becoming? So the first enemy of Stalin was non-Stalinists on the left. These are the people he really went after. As the Soviet Union became more and more influential in the Spanish Civil War, one of the things it did was used its security apparatus, the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB. The NKVD runs the security forces, the police and the secret police of the Spanish Republic, the left-wing government. It goes after the non-Stalinist parts of the left in Spain.\n\nOrwell is up writing on the front against the nationalists-fascists. Then he comes back to Barcelona on leave in May 1937 to see his wife, who was working in Barcelona, and is shocked to find himself getting involved in street fighting with the republican government attacking his own people, his little faction. Then he goes back to the front, fights the fascist and nationalists again, and is shot through the neck. To his amazement, he doesn't die. The bullet misses the artery, the windpipe and the spine, which is kind of a miraculous thing to have happen. He flees Spain. He doesn't know it at the time. We know actually, he and his wife were both indicted right about the time they left, by the republican government for treason and Trotskyite deviationism.\n\nHe flees Spain, goes home to England, and sits down and reads all the newspapers and all their coverage of the Spanish Civil War. He reads the right-wing newspaper. He's not surprised they're lying about what's going on. But then he picks up the left-wing newspapers, with all their coverage of the war over the last six months, and he's shocked to find they're lying too. He comes away from Spain, and the experience of seeing friends of his killed by a left-wing government, thinking very differently about leftist politics. He decides that fascism and communism are actually pretty close together. They are different manifestations of the same thing. They are right-wing and left-wing manifestations of totalitarianism. He decides the key to freedom begins with personal liberty, with the right of the individual to proceed.\n\nHe has his hero in 1984, Winston, say at one point that, \"If you can hold up three fingers and say that's three figures, that's the beginning of freedom.\" Of course, that character in 1984, Winston, is tortured by the government until he sobs, \"Hold up as many fingers as you like, and I'll tell you whatever number that is. That's whatever you like. If you say three fingers, I'll say it's three. If you say it's five, I'll say it's five.\" Then they say, \"No, you don't just say it, you have to believe it too.\" And he was eventually tortured into that.\n\nSR: Right. I'm looking at the front page of today's New York Times where it says, \"GOP senators embrace plan for tax-cut that adds to the deficit.\" It basically said they're not going to pay attention to what nonpartisan economists say the impact will be. This is erasing the past, in Orwell's terms, and --\n\nTR: And it's pissing all over today's facts. It's saying, We don't care about the facts, we are going to let ideology dominate.\n\nSR:Right, and that's what so important about what you have written about, because what readers end up getting is a profile of Churchill, and more so with Orwell, of how an individual can react, and what journalists are supposed to do. Journalists are supposed to recognize the delusions public figures utter and expect people to believe and push back. Individuals are also supposed to ask questions, but it's hard to break with herd mentalities.\n\nTR: And when you do, you're attacked for doing so. The basic job with journalism is the basic job of anyone of goodwill in a democratic society. It is to perceive the facts, and then act upon them. For the journalists, the act is to write about. For other people, the act is to act upon them in some other way.\n\nBut in a really inflamed political situation, in a time of political turmoil, when political parties are changing rapidly, when there's no solid political ground, when compromise is seen as betrayal, when you have a president who believes only in personal loyalty to himself, but doesn't give it back by the way, when you have that kind of situation, people who insist on the facts become the enemies of many other people. It's an uncomfortable position to be in sometimes. I'm not saying it's comfortable.\n\nOne of the things that's striking about Orwell and Churchill, is both became deeply alienated from their own natural political allies. Churchill spent the 1930s insisting that Nazism is becoming stronger, is becoming a threat. That goes against the policy of his party and of his government, because his conservative party is running the government. For that, he is essentially sent into, what he calls, the political wilderness for an entire decade of the 1930s. He has shunned. He is mocked. He is seen as really a washed-up old politician, who is really no longer relevant.\n\nOrwell, likewise, having stood up and said, Look, the left is not always telling the truth about what's going on in Spain, and we need to be careful here -- Orwell also ran into problems with his friends and political allies. Some friends told him he was terribly wrong. He actually found it very hard to get published. Animal Farm, his first classic novel, was turned down by multiple publishers. In fact, an official in the British government went to publishers and London and said, We don't think you should publish this. Orwell didn't know it at the time, but that official, Peter Smollett, turns out to have been working secretly for the Soviet Union at the time.\n\nSR:Yes. When I was reading this, I found it so resonant today, because we are in a media environment where we are deluged with more opinion than information. At the same time, you have the highest levels of government not earning the trust and allegiance of its citizens, but telling them to do what they're told. How dangerous do you think this is?\n\nTR: I think we are at an extremely dangerous political moment in American history. In many ways, while the international situation right now reminds me somewhat of the 1930s, the domestic situation in America reminds me a lot of the 1850s. That's worrisome of course, because the 1850s were followed by the American Civil War.\n\nI've actually had a series of conversations with some retired national security officials, some retired military officers, who are increasingly worried that we are heading for some kind of civil war in this country. Not necessarily a big military set piece battle with Gettysburg type of things, but some kind of chronic, sustained political violence, in which violence plays a large role in shaping politics, which was true by the way of the 1850s in America, especially in Kansas. But it was also true in the 1930s, internationally. I think you could see this from the left, as well as the right -- chronic political violence, assassinations of judges, nullification juries, state government saying they won't go along with the federal government. I'm worried that the left will play into this. For example, there's nothing that the neo-right, the new right, strategists would like more.\n\nIt's a hard time politically. People who insist on the facts, are finding themselves unwelcome, even among their own parties, their own natural allies. I think we especially have to pay attention to people who are willing to call out their own sides. This is the commonality of Churchill and Orwell, but it's also something you see today with American politics. People who really interest me a lot are the people on the left who are willing to criticize the left, and the people of the right, who are willing to criticize the right.\n\nThe most interesting political commentary these days, I find coming from anti-Trump conservatives, who tend to be classic conservatives. People who believe in rule of law, the Constitution, traditional values, and basically American institutions -- classic conservativism. Their critique of Trump is that he believes in none of those things. That he is against the rule of the law. He is ignorant of the Constitution, and he attacks institutions like the judiciary. These people say, Trump is not conservative; don't call him a conservative, he's a reactionary.\n\nI'm not a conservative myself, and so I find that critique illuminating. It makes me understand Trump in a way I wouldn't have otherwise. In fact, one of the gripes I have with American journalism these days, American political journalism, is that it keeps on referring to Trump as a conservative. I'm persuaded by reading these writers; a bunch of them at The Atlantic, like David Frum and Eliot Cohen. Some people at the Washington Post, like former Bush speech writer Michael Gerson. Jennifer Rubin, even Peggy Noonan of the Wall Street Journal sometimes, even Charles Krauthammer on Fox sometimes. These people have made it pretty clear that Trump is not a conservative, and I think it's an error and professional misdeed for political journalists to present Trump as a conservative.\n\nSR: The afterword in the book is almost written in an advisory way, as a swansong to people still practicing journalism. It talks about what's happened to journalism through a set of lenses Orwell would appreciate, particularly what's happened with Silicon Valley. Outside the executive branch, you have this giant technological apparatus that's spying on everybody, creating profiles, selling those mostly to the private sector, but also sharing them with governments, and people don't seem to mind.\n\nTR: No. It's kind of shocking to me that the major product of Silicon Valley is you and me, the American individual, that they're mining our lives, literally. I was kind of struck that Orwell as a writer went out and actually, in England, went down to the coal mines to write about the coal miners. What we need today is writers who go down into the mines of Silicon Valley, and write about how our lives are being excavated and exploited as resources by these big new companies; Google, Apple, Microsoft, and a score of others.\n\nSR: Having thought about this so much, what would be the takeaways you would want to impart to people who care about representative government, and care about informative media, and care leading their lives with a certain amount of privacy and dignity?\n\nTR: My point of departure is we no longer live in a democracy in America right now. I believe we live in an oligarchy. When you live in an oligarchy, you are going to have the means of information, as well as the means of production, in the hands of the rich and powerful, who will tell you not to believe your own perceptions. To trust them. So I go back to Orwell saying, You need to begin by trusting your own perceptions. But they can't just be uninformed perceptions. Both Churchill and Orwell say you need to go and find the facts.\n\nWhat I try to do in that afterword -- which is kind of my journalistic last will and testament, and kind of a pep talk to people like you who are still slaving away in the salt mines of journalism -- what I'm trying to do there is say, Hang in there. The foundation of Western civilization is what you are doing. Seeking the facts, and observing accurately what is going on. This is why, to me, I decided... Let me back up. This is why I ended the book by talking about Martin Luther King Jr. and his letter from the Birmingham City Jail, written in I believe 1962 or '63. It's an odd place to go in the book about two English men from the 1930s and '40s, but I see King as solidly in the tradition of Churchill and Orwell.\n\nWhen I looked around the American scene, thinking about is there anybody like them today, I thought, no. I really don't see anybody quite like them today. But Martin Luther King Jr., in retrospect, walked in the footsteps of both Churchill and Orwell. He begins, in his letter from Birmingham Jail, writing very much as Orwell would have. What are the facts of the matter? He answers his question. The fact of the matter is that Birmingham is the most segregated city in America. Why is that? He explores. He says, The civil rights, that the federal government tells the Negro he has, are not allowed to the Negro citizens of Birmingham. In fact, the apparatus of the state is used to prevent them from exercising those rights.\n\nThis is why it's so brilliant of King to insist on being jailed. He said, All I'm trying to do is exercise the rights my government tells me I have. So when my government puts me in jail for doing that, there is a problem. The problem is not with me. The problem is with the government that is saying out of its mouth, I have these rights. But it's saying with his arms, no you don't.\n\nI think he does a beautiful job of saying, Here are the principles, here are the facts, and how do I apply my principles to those facts? I think it's something that we all can emulate today, but especially journalists. I would take away, also the warning, it's not going to make you popular. It's not something that a lot of people want to hear right now. Nonetheless, it's the right thing to do in the long run. It is an act of great patriotism to your country, and to your fellow citizens, to write and observe accurately.", "Daughter of high-profile dissidents talks about how their murder nearly 20 years ago continues to inform her work\n\nEvery autumn, the Iranian artist Parastou Forouhar returns to Tehran from Germany to hold a memorial service for her murdered parents.\n\nDariush Forouhar, a secular politician, and his wife, Parvaneh, were two of Iran's most high-profile political activists when they were stabbed to death in their home on 22 November 1998. The killers placed her father's body in a chair facing towards the Qibla, the direction of Mecca.\n\nForouhar, 55, remembers receiving a call from a BBC reporter asking when she had last spoken to her parents.\n\n\"I called a close friend of my parents in Paris and he was crying,\" Forouhar says. \"I thought, it mustn't be just an arrest. We were used to [arrests]. I said, is Dad killed? He said, it's not just your dad.\"\n\nEvery year since, Parastou has gathered with close relatives to light a candle and pay tribute to her parents' secular democratic values. The public are routinely blocked from attending by security officials.\n\n\"They won't let people in for the ceremony [but] it gets media coverage and it becomes an act of protest,\" says Forouhar, whose work was recently exhibited at Pi Artworks in London.\n\nForouhar says regularly revisiting the suffering she has endured for nearly 20 years has helped to heal the wounds of her past.\n\n\"When I work, I also have pain, you want to move on but also reproduce the pain at the same time,\" she says. \"Sometimes I can't distinguish; is it art or pain? It's really like finding healing in repetition. For me, the way to deal with pain is to reproduce it in art.\"\n\nThe murder of Forouhar's parents shone a spotlight on the killings and disappearances of other Iranian dissident intellectuals in the 1990s and created an atmosphere of fear that helped put the brakes on the reformist agenda of President Mohammad Khatami.\n\nIn a rare admission in 1999, Iran's ministry of intelligence took responsibility for the killings, saying it had \"committed these criminal activities ... under the influence of undercover rogue agents\". Saeed Hajjarian, a reformist politician and journalist involved in revealing the \"chain murders\", survived an attempted murder the following year but was left severely disabled.\n\nForouhar studied art at Tehran University after the 1979 Islamic revolution and says it was the failure of the revolution that made her the artist she is today.\n\n\"We thought, we'll build a better life, we thought it was possible, but then we realised those who hijacked the revolution are suppressing the segment of the society that did not approve of revolutionary policies,\" she said. \"The streets turned unsafe and the arrests and the executions followed.\"\n\nShe left for Germany in 1991, graduating with a master's from Offenbach am Main and holding her first exhibition at her university in 1994. Forouhar established a portfolio of works that she defines as being between \"abstraction and the formation of metaphors\", drawing on what she learned in Tehran, when students expressed dissent through highly coded and alternative methods.\n\n\"I use ornaments as a structure in my work - I like the structure of repetition, of harmony and congruity,\" she says. \"Ornaments have similarities with totalitarian regimes. They want to make everything harmonic, and anything that doesn't confirm has to be eliminated.\"\n\nButterflies feature prominently, but they are composed of human bodies in agonising pain.\n\n\"In Persian poetry, butterflies are often described as being in the height of aesthetics, but often also shown as dying. It has a paradox inside it. And it's also the name of my mother (Parvaneh means butterfly in Farsi). Every time I produce one, it's as if I'm producing an image of my mother.\"\n\nHer works are about \"simultaneity of beauty and harm\" and \"the ambivalence of their co-existence\". She has previously said she wants to encourage viewers to \"give up their distances, ambivalent positions, and rethink their presumptions - to recognise and respond to these contradictions and contrasting emotions\".\n\nHer recent work, Written Room, which features in a group exhibition in Paris this month, shows giant Farsi calligraphy covering the surfaces of gallery spaces. Her other fascination has been with the influx of refugees to Europe in recent years, and recent work showsmigrants drowning at sea on paper she made herself.\n\n\"This is a turning point for Europe, to see how it will react - its response to refugees drowning will define its future identity.\"\n\nForouhar also has an installation in progress, called Documentation. It first went on show in 1999 in Frankfurt and features a room full of documents pinned to the wall or stored in boxes. It includes every piece of correspondence she has had with human rights organisations, Iran's judiciary, Germany's parliament, and other officials, regarding her parents' murder. A photocopier sits in the middle and viewers are invited to make copies of the documents and take them home. Every year, she updates the work with new correspondence.\n\nThough the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani was re-elected as Iran's president in a landslide victory in May, Forouhar does not believe his terms in office will bring a new dawn.\n\n\"His election marks the total retreat of the whole society from the demands it had during the Green movement [of 2009],\" she says. \"It's a reconciliation between the government and the people, and the people gave in, as if the people have become accomplice. This is all an illusion.\"", "Image: Amazon\n\nThe world of IoT is rife with stories of devices being exploited to provide people with access to all sorts of things. Which is why I'm somewhat cautious about the newly announced Amazon Echo Spot. While it looks like a clock radio, it also has a tiny camera. And that, frankly, is cause for concern.\n\nWhen George Orwell wrote 1984, he imagined a world dominated by a totalitarian party that surveilled its citizens through a network of cameras that captured the every move of its citizens. Of course, the cameras were placed by the regime that was governed by the all powerful Big Brother, who our protagonist Winston Smith looked up to with live by the time the story ended.\n\nBut, instead, we live in a world where we are doing Big Brother's dirty work. Many of us voluntarily share personal information, our location, relationships, photos and more. And, although we might not give it a second thought, we do have an opportunity to not press the \"Send\" button.\n\nBut a camera... that's a whole different ball game I think.\n\nSo, here's something to ponder over the weekend. How do you feel about installing a camera in your bedroom? Do you trust Amazon? What about the Amazon of next year or beyond? Will you be buying an Echo Spot?\n\nWATCH MORE: Tech News", "The flag is a symbol, and there is no agreement as to what it actually symbolizes. By design, the flag's thirteen stripes stand for the original 13 states, none of which would ban slavery. The 14th state, Vermont, was the first state to ban slavery, doing it weakly in its 1777 state constitution (not that the principle was enforced: in 1802 the Town of Windsor sued a State Supreme Court justice to get him to take care of an elderly, infirm slave he had dumped on town welfare; the town lost the case). The original flag had 13 stars for those same original 13 states, and it took over 70 years before all 36 stars in the 1865 flag represented states without slavery (but not states without racist Jim Crow laws and the freedom to lynch without consequence). The colors of the stars and stripes had no meaning in 1777, when it was adopted, as distinct from the colors of the Great Seal that did have meaning.\n\nThen there's the Star Spangled Banner, written by a slave owner in celebration of the defense of a slave state in a battle against the British. The British force included a contingent of former slaves who were promised freedom if they fought for the British. How many people at the beginning of a sports event understand \"the land of the free and the home of the brave\" in its deepest historical irony?\n\nAll in all, the typical American flag ritual is an exercise in mindless obedience in which any talk of real meaning interferes with the underlying objective of fealty to the state. The ritual is totemic and totalitarian, but not so extreme as the Two Minutes Hate required by the Party in George Orwell's novel \"1984.\" The difference is one of degree, not kind, and the enemy in both instances is rational, individual thought.\n\nMindless obedience has long been a goal of self-appointed patriots, wrapping themselves in the flag to defend indefensible domestic injustice or criminal wars (both of which we have more than our share these days). There is no meaning in the demand to \"respect\" any abstract symbol, much less one as drenched in horrifying contradiction as the American flag. In a mature world, respect is what you earn, not what you demand. In a mature world, a person is respected for who and what he or she is and does, not for any office or position of authority. We do not live in a mature world.\n\nSome quarterbacks are more obtuse than others\n\nMore than a year ago, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick first sat quietly, then kneeled during the national anthem at the beginning of his team's games. The gesture was quiet, respectful, and principled. And Kaepernick was articulate in his explanation that he was objecting to bigotry and injustice in America, and especially to police suffering no consequences for shooting and killing unarmed black men. For this objection, he has been blacklisted by the National Football League owners, the same owners who turkey-danced in all directions last weekend in a panic to find the right response to an intensity of protest they mostly neither shared nor understood, beyond the need for public relations management.\n\nNo one has a coherent argument for saluting the flag, because there isn't one. The flag ritual is an expression of our secular religion, American Exceptionalism. Coherence and reason are at best irrelevant and require suppression before they spread and become a threat. The result is widespread confusion among a large portion of the population, expressed as sincerely and sadly as anyone by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. Brees started by making it about President Trump, which it's not, and then went on to say with inarticulate imprecision: \"I disagree with what the President said and how he said it. I think it's very unbecoming of the office of the President of the United States to talk like that to the great people like that.\"\n\nThe rest of the Drew Brees statement got even more disconnected in its thought pattern:\n\nWell, let me say this first: Do I think that there is inequality in this country? Yes, I do. Do I think that there is racism? Yes, I do. I think there's inequality for women, for women in the workplace. I think that there's inequality for people of color, for minorities, for immigrants.\n\nBut as it pertains to the National Anthem, I will always feel that if you are an American, that the National Anthem is the opportunity for us all to stand up together, to be unified and to show respect for our country, to show respect for what it stands for, the birth of our nation.\n\nWe will -- there will always be issues with our country. There will always be things that we're battling, and we should all be striving to make those things better.\n\nBut if the protest becomes that we're going to sit down or kneel or not show respect to the flag of the United States of America and everything that it symbolizes and everything that it stands for and everything that our country has been through to get to this point, I do not agree with that.\n\nI feel like that is a unifying thing.\n\nThe national anthem and standing for the national anthem and looking at the flag with your hand over your heart is a unifying thing that should bring us all together and say, \"You know what? We know that things are not where they should be, but we will continue to work and strive to make things better, to bring equality to all people: men, women, no matter what your race, creed, religion - it doesn't matter - equality for all.\" But if you're an American, then I will always believe that we should be standing, showing respect to our flag with our hand over our heart.\n\nWell, that's just nuts. And it hasn't worked. Historically, all the flag worship in the world has done little to assure justice. Like an ungodly number of his fellow citizens, Brees is deep in American denial. His is a common knee-jerk response, absent logical thought despite some accurate perceptions. Yes, it sort of sounds good - until you try to figure out what it means. Knee-jerk reactions are not about knees but jerks. And when people like Brees are standing for the national anthem, what are they really standing for?\n\nIs this a tipping point? Are we watching a fad or a movement?\n\nWhen Colin Kaepernick was protesting alone in 2016, it's doubtful even he expected to see so many NFL players and owners expressing such solidarity and support in 2017. Granted, the message was muddled, as some players kneeled, some linked arms, some stayed in the locker room, and so on, with no clear message emerging beyond, perhaps, some disgruntlement at being dissed by Trump. The game is on, but it's not clear yet what the game is, and no clear leadership has emerged. But the legitimacy of professional American athletes protesting, even in the mildest way, is a new thing. If the protest expands and endures and coheres, it could be a very good thing for the country. These protestors include an inordinate number of new millionaires who have decided not to forget what they know about being black and brown in this America. And for anyone wondering what that means, there's America's response to storms in Texas and Florida, and America's virtual abandonment of Puerto Rico, as Trump blames the looted colony for being at the mercy of the United States. Puerto Ricans are American citizens who serve in the US military at disproportionately high rates. Tell them about saluting the flag.\n\nAnd now sports protest has spread from professional football to major league baseball, although just barely. On September 23, Oakland Athletics rookie catcher Bruce Maxwell became first major league baseball player to kneel for the national anthem, hat over his heart and a teammate's hand on his shoulder. Maxwell was born on a US military base in Germany. He is the son of a career soldier. Maxwell's statement after the event had a coherence Drew Brees should envy:\n\nThe point of my kneeling is not to disrespect our military. It's not to disrespect our constitution. My hand was over my heart because I love this country. I've had plenty of family members, including my father, that have bled for this country, that continue to serve for this country. At the end of the day, this is the best country on the planet. I am and forever will be an American citizen, and I'm more than forever grateful for being here. But my kneeling is what is getting the attention, because I'm kneeling for the people that don't have a voice. This goes beyond the black community. This goes beyond the Hispanic community. Because right now we're having a racial divide in all types of people. It's being practiced from the highest power that we have in this country, and he's basically saying that it's OK to treat people differently. My kneeling, the way I did it, was to symbolize the fact that I'm kneeling for a cause, but I'm in no way or form disrespecting my country or my flag.\n\nMaxwell is, intentionally or not, echoing Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address in 1861, when he said, with seven states already seceded from the union for the sake of slavery:\n\nWe are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\n\nWe have no president today capable of such words, and even less capable of such sentiments. That understanding is part of what drives NFL players to demonstrate, however inchoately. From Kaepernick to Maxwell, professional athletes are in touch with our better angels, and this is something new in American life. It is enough to give one hope, at least for the moment. Maybe they will be bullied back into silence and mindless obedience by the screechers demanding respect - respect for the flag, respect for the military, respect for the police even though they keep killing unarmed black people (and others). The screechers know no boundaries and are unburdened by integrity; they want only consent by any means necessary. But they are screeching for a despicable president who earns disrespect daily, so maybe hundreds, even thousands of over-privileged professional athletes will become America's saving grace. We're a long way from there.

However the right-wing AfD, or Alternate for Deutschland, won 94 seats in Parliament, making it the third largest party. The AfD ran on an anti-immigrant policy and is the first right-wing party to enter the German Parliament since WW2. Merkel must form a coalition with three other very diverse political parties. There is a worry that the racist, and critics say neo-nazi, views of some of the AfD leaders could be a threat to German democracy. Many Germans were surprised by the election results, saying that many voted against Merkel rather than for the AfD.\n\nFrom CUBA- Cuba offered Puerto Rico medical assistance at the start of the week. The Spanish federal government has charged leaders of the separatist referendum with sedition- there were raids on Catalan government offices seizing ballots and arresting 14 government leaders- the vote is scheduled to be held October 1. The Venezuelan Foreign Minister has accused the US and Spain of interfering in internal affairs- Spanish PM Rajoy joined Trump in a press conference denouncing a totalitarian drift in Venezuela. Bolivian President Evo Morales slammed US interventionist policies against Venezuela, saying it is an attack on all of Latin America. At the UN Venezuelan Foreign Minister recalled the words of Hugo Chavez saying that the podium still smells of sulfur. The Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno says his country will continue to offer asylum to Julian Assange.\n\nFrom JAPAN- Japanese President Abe dissolved the lower house of Parliament in an attempt to get a fresh mandate on tax proposals and his stance on North Korea. The US is easing restrictions on dairy products from Japan, imposed after Fukushima. Japanese car makers will use interchangeable parts in upcoming electric vehicles. The UN marked Sept 26 as the international day for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Putin announced that Russia is destroying its last chemical weapons. European ambassadors to the US cautioned Trump about abandoning the nuclear deal with Iran. North Korea called Trump's threats as a declaration of war. The South Korean media wondered why North Korea did not react to recent US warplane flights near the peninsula.\n\nThere is an article about the Shortwave Report by Cassandra Roos on line -\n\nhttp://www.campusprogress.org/soundvision/780/big-stories-shortwaves\n\nI was interviewed for an informative weekly radio show Mediageek, available at http://www.mediageek.net/sound/2006/mg100606-64k.mp3\n\nAll that plus times and frequencies for listening at home.
